The data was more benign than implied by the TIPP Online data. However, expectations did fall by more than expected, while conditions rose unexpectedly. The key stands out were the inflation expectations gauges, which both fell; the one-year outlook slipped to 2.6% from 2.9%, and the 5-10 year gauge fell to a record low 2.2% from 2.6% -- challenging the notion that inflation weakness is 'transitory'. \"We’re guessing that responses to consumer surveys in recent weeks have been heavily dependent on timing, given the chaotic announcement and then abandonment of tariffs on Mexican imports,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said. \"Some 40% of respondents to the Michigan survey mentioned tariffs, unprompted.\" The consultancy notes that, short-term noise aside, consumer confidence remains very elevated, and consistent with rapid growth in spending. \"The constraint on spending growth is the rate of increase of real after-tax incomes - solid but not spectacular - rather than confidence,\" it says, \"that suggests a trend of about 2.5%.\"</p><p><strong>* US BUSINESS INVENTORIES: </strong>Rose 0.5% in April, with analysts attributing the rise to stock builders by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. The inventory to sales ratio rose to 1.39 months from 1.38. \"While inventories are poised to be a sizable drag, we now see upside risk to our Q2 real GDP growth forecast of 1.3% after this morning’s solid retail sales and inventories data,\" Oxford Economics said, \"we expect businesses to manage with relatively leaner inventory levels in the coming months, following the largely involuntary inventory build early in 2019.\"</p><p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: </strong>Rose +0.4% M/M in May, eating the consensus +0.2%. Manufacturing production rose 0.2% in line with the consensus, while capacity utilisation rose more thna expected to 78.1%. \"The capex-sensitive business equipment category rose by 0.2% following last month’s decline,\" Goldman Sachs notes, and \"the utilities component, an input into consumption in the GDP accounts, rebounded sharply (+2.1).\" After the data, Goldman boosted its Q2 GDP tracking estimate by four tenths to +1.6% (qoq ar).</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>US President Trump echoed Secretary of State Pompeo's Thursday comments, saying that the tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman have Iran “written all over it”, adding that he would not let them shut the Strait of Hormuz. As the US stance shifts more hawkish over Iran, the OPEC member’s President Rouhani said that Iran should strengthen its ties with Russia, who too are headway against the US. Trump did reiterate his previous stance that he is not looking “to hurt” Iran but caveated it by saying they could not be allowed to have nuclear weapons.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP INTERVIEW(S):</strong> US President Trump gave another wide-ranging interview on Fox News. On Iran, he said the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks have Iran \"written all over it\", and intimated that there'd be repercussions if the nation closed the Straits of Hormuz, saying if that happened, it would be \"short-lived.\"; he later added that he was not looking to hurt Iran, but it cannot have nuclear weapons. Trump also gave an exclusive interview to ABC, where he renewed criticism of the Fed, saying that the Fed Chair was his pick, but he \"disagrees with him entirely\". He said that the market would be stronger \"if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve who wouldn’t have raised interest rates so much”, and when he was asked whether he has concerns that his repeated criticism of Fed puts Powell \"in a box\", he replied that he dues, \"but I'm gonna do it anyway because I've waited long enough.” Trump repeated his view that he thinks the market [assume Dow] could be 10,000 points higher if the Federal Reserve hadn’t hiked rates last year, while also repeating that there's no inflation in the US. On China, Trump repeated his accusation that it manipulates its currency, and said it does not matter if China President Xi did not attend the G20 (he has previously threatened to apply tariffs on the remaining portion of Chinese imports if Xi did not meet with him at the G20.</p><p><strong>* CHINA/TRADE: </strong>A WTO dispute panel on Friday said the US and China have agreed a suspension of legal proceedings in the intellectual property dispute until December 31st. Elsewhere, China's Foreign Ministry said it had lodged stern representations to the US regarding Hong Kong, and summoned senior US embassy official and demanding the US to stop interfering in its affairs immediately. Later, an SCMP article claimed China and Russia could be about to upgrade their relationship to something close to an alliance, as both try to fend off pressure from the West.</p><p><strong>* INDIA: </strong>India is reportedly preparing to impose higher tariffs on over 20 US goods next week, including almonds, walnuts and apples. This follows the Trump administration recently scrapping trade privileges for India under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).</p><p><strong>* TURKEY:&nbsp;</strong>On Friday, Turkey’s Foreign Minister stated that it will retaliate in the event that the US imposes sanctions due to the S-400 missile system; on Thursday, Turkey said that they will not back down from the S-400 deal with Russia and adding, in what was seemingly an explicit message to the US, that no country had the right to give Turkey an ultimatum. The US has recently been upping the pressure on Turkey to drop the Russian-made missile system; on Thursday, a letter sent by the US warned “there is strong bipartisan US Congressional determination to see CAATSA sanctions imposed on Turkey if Turkey acquires the S-400” and US Acting Defence Secretary Shanahan, who gave the country until 31 July to drop the deal with Russia.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>After leading the First Ballot by a greater margin than was expected, some Tory leaders are mulling joining forces in an effort to thwart the leadership bid of Brexiteer Boris Johnson. Matt Hancock pulled out of the race, with analysts suggesting it was a move designed to undilute the candidate choices, to try and rally support around pro-EU candidates that can challenge Johnson. Johnson later commented that he isn’t aiming for a no-deal and he doesn’t want no-deal as an outcome, although he refrained from taking the possibility of the outcome off of the table as expected. He also stated that he is happy to partake in the BBC TV debate on Tuesday, after prior speculation that he would skip the event. Note: Channel 4 hosts its debate on Sunday, which Johnson is currently not due to partake in, with the BBC TV debate to occur on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N9) SETTLE USD 0.23 HIGHER AT USD 52.51/BBL; BRENT (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.70 HIGHER AT USD 62.01:</strong> Crude traded choppy on Friday, with benchmarks trading range-bound/lower in most of the session, before heading higher into the close, but remaining beneath Thursday’s geopolitically-induced highs. The market seemingly returned to its demand focused downward path early in the session; PVM analysts described Thursday as having “all the hallmarks of an algo-triggered kneejerk reaction.” It is too early to determine whether the bounce on Thursday was a temporary “hiccup”, given the increased acknowledgement among US officials that Iran was behind the tanker attacks, with potential for further escalation in the oil rich region. Analysts at Citi said that “the market price action implies a low probability that the conflict would spiral out of control in that way.” The market is likely to be looking for further confirmation of a shift in tensions for it to rally in the face of faltering global demand.</p><p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> In fitting with both the EIA and OPEC, the IEA cut its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast by 100K BPD to 1.2mln BPD. Like OPEC, the IEA acknowledged a slowdown in oil demand growth in H1 but expects a pickup to 1.6mln BPD in H2. The report acknowledged the drop in OPEC supply, and expects Non-OPEC supply growth to accelerate from 1.9mln BPD in 2019 to 2.3mln BPD in 2020.</p><p><strong>* US T-Note futures (M9) 2 ticks lower at 126-30: </strong>A solid batch of data out of the US saw the curve bear-flatten, with shorter-dated yields rising about 2bps (at settle) vs yields on 30s declining by around 1bps. Early trade was defined by risk-off type flows, which led to some concerns that the 10-year yield could breach the 2.00% mark. However, haven trade was usurped by decent fundamentals, with traders reducing bets that the Fed could cut rates next week in wake of the upbeat data. The implied probability of a June rate cut has fallen to around 25% from around 33% on Thursday, while July pricing eased slightly too. However, the TPLEX found buyers after the inflation gauges in the Michigan Sentiment data declined sharply, challenging Fed Chair Powell's view that inflation weakness was transitory, and perhaps giving further credence to the notion that the Fed has grounds to cut based on inflation alone, let alone for \"insurance\" reasons to guard against the fall-out from global trade tensions. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower to the tune of 2bps.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 2887, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% at 7479, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26090, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, Consumer Staples 0%, Energy -0.7%, Financials 0.3%, Health Care -0.3%, Industrials -0.4%, Information Technology -0.8%, Materials -0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Broadcom (AVGO) sunk after market on Thursday, after cutting its FY19 revenue view, and warned it sees “a broad-based slowdown in the demand environment,” comments which dragged the broader semiconductor sector lower, including heavyweights Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) who finished in the red. Facebook (FB) moved higher on the news that over a dozen companies, including Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and Uber (UBER) have signed up to back Facebook’s soon to be released cryptocurrency. Tesla (TSLA) moved lower after the electric automaker had an additional request for tariff exemptions rejected by the US government, but went flat on a report from Elektrek suggesting the automaker is on track for a record quarter. Shares of Sony’s ADR (SNE) moved higher after it received a USD 1.5bln investment from hedge fund Third Point, which called on it to spin-off its image sensor arm. Twitter (TWTR) edged higher as the tech sector fell, after the co deleted thousands of accounts tied to Iran and upped its efforts to end false information campaigns. FedEx (FDX) fell after China launched an enquiry into its recent Huawei delivery mistakes. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) spiked higher on the news the DoJ were nearing approval for the merger, although the DoJ are said to be maintaining there demands for the two to divest assets for the merger to be approved. Verizon (VZ) also spiked higher, on news the telecoms co. is to build a fiber-based distribution network connecting the NBA's 29 arenas.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD was supported by haven demand in early trade, finding a further boost from solid data which weighed on Fed rate cut pricing. <strong>EUR</strong> and <strong>GBP </strong>both eased as the buck picked up, with the former sliding beneath 1.13 towards 1.12, while the latter continues to feel the impact of Brexiteer Boris Johnson leading the race to become PM; GBP took out last week’s low and trades sub 1.26. <strong>JPY</strong> continues to be uneventful and sticks within the 108.00-108.50 range, although <strong>XAU</strong> backed-off highs, as solid data somewhat reduces the chances of immediate Fed rate cuts, while Michigan Consumer sentiment data saw inflation gauges fall sharply. <strong>CAD</strong> took its cue more from the stronger dollar, as opposed to oil prices, and USDCAD topping 1.34 level. <strong>AUD</strong> sunk back towards its May lows, trades sub-0.69 heading into the weekend, ahead of next week’s RBA minutes; more banks have joined the chorus calling for further rate cuts after this week’s disappointing jobs data. <strong>NZD</strong> fell after disappointing survey data. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed; <strong>BRL</strong> sunk on reports that lawmakers had given into the public servant’s lobby, who had been working to halt pension reform. <strong>RUB</strong> was a little firmer, largely unaffected as the Russian Central Bank opted to cut rates (as expected) and Governor Nabiullina delivering dovish remarks. <strong>TRY</strong> was under pressure after the Turkish government threatened to retaliate to any US sanctions relating to the Russian S-400 missile system.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong> for a recap of this week’s action, please <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/weekly-fx-wrap-firm-friday-data-dampens-fed-rate-cut-furore-14-06-2019\">click here.</a></p><p><strong>* RANSQUAWK CENTRAL BANKS WEEKLY - </strong>PREVIEWING FOMC, BOE, BOJ, Norges Bank, BCB, RBA mins; REVIEWING SNB, CBR, CBRT: To download the report, please click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22076/download\">here.</a></p>",

Early trade was defined by risk-off type flows, which led to some concerns that the 10-year yield could breach the 2.00% mark. However, haven trade was usurped by decent fundamentals, with traders reducing bets that the Fed could cut rates next week in wake of the upbeat data. The implied probability of a June rate cut has fallen to around 25% from around 33% on Thursday, while July pricing eased slightly too. However, the TPLEX found buyers after the inflation gauges in the Michigan Sentiment data declined sharply, challenging Fed Chair Powell's view that inflation weakness was transitory, and perhaps giving further credence to the notion that the Fed has grounds to cut based on inflation alone, let alone for \"insurance\" reasons to guard against the fall-out from global trade tensions. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower to the tune of 2bps.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>Crude </strong>traded choppy on Friday, with benchmarks trading range-bound/lower in most of the session, before heading higher into the close, but remaining beneath Thursday’s geopolitically-induced highs. The market seemingly returned to its demand focused downward path early in the session; PVM analysts described Thursday as having “all the hallmarks of an algo-triggered kneejerk reaction.” It is too early to determine whether the bounce on Thursday was a temporary “hiccup”, given the increased acknowledgement among US officials that Iran was behind the tanker attacks, with potential for further escalation in the oil rich region. Analysts at Citi said that “the market price action implies a low probability that the conflict would spiral out of control in that way.” The market is likely to be looking for further confirmation of a shift in tensions for it to rally in the face of faltering global demand.</li><li><strong>IEA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> In fitting with both the EIA and OPEC, the IEA cut its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast by 100K BPD to 1.2mln BPD. Like OPEC, the IEA acknowledged a slowdown in oil demand growth in H1 but expects a pickup to 1.6mln BPD in H2. The report acknowledged the drop in OPEC supply, and expects Non-OPEC supply growth to accelerate from 1.9mln BPD in 2019 to 2.3mln BPD in 2020.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: firm Friday data dampens Fed rate cut furore",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and index accordingly are ending the week on the up as US retail sales came in above expectations and were embellished by significant back month upgrades (to positive from negative and +0.4% from flat for the key control group) before ip beat consensus to provide a bit more positivity. The DXY has extended recovery gains to 97.413 and through pre-NFP highs (97.370) vs 96.578 lows posted after benign PPI and CPI reports boosted Fed easing probabilities to 30%+ for next week’s FOMC and over 90% for the July policy meeting. However, at least one insurance cut is still widely anticipated so the index may fade ahead of 97.500 and the next upside chart target at 97.546 (late May pull-back low and only a day after hitting the current 98.371 ytd best), especially with inflation expectations via the University of Michigan falling markedly. On the flip-side, the Greenback has benefited from its safe-haven status amidst heightened global trade and geopolitical strains with only the Yen, Gold and a select few other rival currencies outperforming or strong on specific impulses.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, Usd/Jpy and Jpy crosses have been trending lower on mainly risk-off grounds as relations between the US and China/Iran/Turkey/India/Russia and the EU etc deteriorated on tariff and/or diplomatic issues and another oil tanker attack soured sentiment on supply concerns. The headline pair has been largely below 108.50 within a 108.79-14 range and also capped by dovish BoJ vibes ahead of next Friday’s policy convene plus pledges of fiscal stimulus from Japan’s Government.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The non-US Dollars are all heading for net and hefty losses vs the Greenback with the Aussie slipping further below 0.6900 in wake of mixed to weak jobs data that underpinned forecasts for further RBA easing, and even prompted some to target a lower OCR than previously anticipated. Similarly, the Kiwi is now hovering precariously above 0.6500, partly in sympathy with its Antipodean counterpart, but also as NZ manufacturing PMI only just avoided contraction to raise question marks over recent RBNZ guidance for steady policy for the foreseeable future per Assistant Governor Hawkesby. The Loonie has been more volatile after a strong start to the week on starkly contrasting upbeat Canadian vs bleak US jobs data last week. Indeed, Usd/Cad kicked off around 1.3245 and extended losses to 1.3225 at one stage with some interim pressure from the spike in after the Gulf of Oman vessels were targeted. However, the pair is now at new highs circa 1.3385 and eyeing 1.3400 ahead of June 6’s pinnacle at 1.3431.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on the receiving end of the firm Buck revival as Cable retreats further from 1.2700+ peaks and the single currency from 1.1300+ at best, with additional negative impulses via dire UK GDP and production, political uncertainty as the Tory leadership race kicked off and no deal Brexit jitters after staunch leaver Boris Johnson romped to victory in the first elimination vote. Note, the Pound did derive some traction from above consensus average earnings, but is now only just keeping its head above 1.2600, though Eur/Gbp is pivoting 0.8900 and close to where the cross started the week as Eur/Usd drifts down towards support ahead of 1.1200 in the form of the 30 DMA (1.1214). Elsewhere, the Franc has lagged fellow safe-havens for the most part, albeit displaying more of that allure against the Euro that had downbeat Eurozone macro news and ongoing Italy-EU budget wrangling to contend with. Usd/Chf is 100+ pips off the lows and back near parity with the SNB reinforcing dovish policy, intervention and stressing that there is more in the monetary policy locker to combat excessive Franc strength given heightened prospects of increased demand and more pronounced downside risks to the economy.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are both heading for decent gains on a mixture of bullish technical factors and Norges Bank/Riksbank divergence vs the ECB and other Central Banks as Eur/Nok nestles near the base of 9.8300-7525 parameters and Eur/Sek sits closer to the bottom of a 10.7175-6260 band. Firmer than expected Swedish inflation data has also underpinned the Swedish Krona, while its Norwegian peer was only briefly knocked by a weaker than forecast CPI report as the latest Norges Bank regional survey was upbeat.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Not many regional currencies escaped the overall downturn in risk sentiment, but the Rand was also rocked by a fraud probe against SA Presdident Ramaphosa, the Indian Rupiah had to digest an RBI rate cut and shift to accommodation from neutral, while the Lira was undermined by a ratchet up in Turkish-US angst and decline in reserves after fleeting support from the CBRT that maintained a tightening bias. Conversely, the Real was shielded to an extent by positive news and views on the Brazilian Pension Reform bill front.</p>",

However, Bunds continue to climb after fewer, more fleeting and shallower pull-backs, with the 10 year Eurozone benchmark now poised to surpass 172.00 having eclipsed chart ‘resistance’ at 171.97.

The report also noted that OPEC supply in May fell to the lowest since 2014 due to Iranian sanctions, in which Iranian oil production fell to the lowest since the 1980s.

        "content": "<p>As another Tory leadership candidate raises the white flag and by default if not design boosts BoJo’s prospects, UK debt has recoiled from marginal new record highs at 130.68 and is struggling to pick up the baton again from a fresh 130.37 Liffe base. However, Bunds continue to climb after fewer, more fleeting and shallower pull-backs, with the 10 year Eurozone benchmark now poised to surpass 172.00 having eclipsed chart ‘resistance’ at 171.97. Similarly, US Treasuries are eyeing upside technical levels, like 127-23 in the 10 year note and in the current safe-haven vs risk-off environment it is conceivable that the symbolical 2% cash yield could be tested, especially with this week’s supply out of the way and if looming data adds more fuel the Fed rate cut fire. Back to Eurex, 172.09 has been flagged on some charts as a level, but again resistance appears futile in the current clime.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index continues respect resistance above the psychological 97.000 level (on a closing basis) and ahead of the recent range top at 97.370, as safer currency havens outperform amidst heightened geopolitical and global trade tensions. Moreover, the Dollar remains capped by growing expectations that the Fed will flag a rate cut next week following a run of macro data pointing to a more pronounced slowdown in the economy and benign inflation that that challenges the transitory theory put forward by Powell and other at the last FOMC gathering. On that note, impending retail sales and ip reports could cement an ease in July if not this month. DXY currently relatively contained within a 97.154-96.942 range.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK</strong></p><p>The Yen has nudged back up towards 108.00 vs the Buck, and is only really lagging behind Gold in the aforementioned risk-off climate plus the Swedish Krona in the G10 stakes due to firmer than forecast CPI and CPIF metrics that keeps the Riksbank on track to raise the repo. However, Usd/Jpy is still encountering underlying bids ahead of the big figure and may also be propped by decent option expiry interest between 108.00 and 108.15 (1 bn). Back to Scandinavia, Eur/Sek has extended post-inflation data declines through technical support at 10.6500 (10 DMA) and briefly below 10.6400 vs 10.7100+ at one stage.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major losers yet again, and with the Kiwi now underperforming after NZ manufacturing PMI only just held above the 50.0 threshold. Nzd/Usd has slipped under 0.6550 towards 0.6525 and Aud/Nzd is pivoting 1.0550 even though the Aussie has relinquished the 0.6900 handle and chart support a pip below amidst another round of more aggressive RBA policy easing calls (NAB now predicting 3 cuts in 2019 from 2 previously and RBC reckons the OCR will be lowered to 0.5% by May next year).</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>All lower against the Greenback as well, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the Antipodean Dollars and to varying degrees. The single currency is retreating further from 1.1300 where massive expiries run off (4.4 bn) and the Loonie has reversed to test support ahead of 1.3350 having lost some of Thursday’s oil-powered momentum as crude prices simmer down after the post-tanker attack spike. Meanwhile, the Franc has pared gains across the board with Usd/Chf at the upper end of a 0.9966-26 band and Eur/Chf back above 1.1200 on SNB reflection (renewed and reemphasised convictions to keep NIRP or even cut deeper and continue intervention). Elsewhere, Cable has is now pivoting 1.2650 with independent bearish impulses from the ongoing UK political hiatus and resultant suspension of any real Brexit developments, but BoE Governor Carney may provide some additional impetus later.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No respite for the Lira it seems as Usd/Try rallies through 5.9000 to 5.9300+ and not far from chart resistance around 5.9500, including a 50% Fib of the retracement from last month’s highs to earlier June lows. The latest catalyst, warnings from Turkey’s Foreign Ministry that any US sanctions will be reciprocated.</p>",

(Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>US</p><p>The Treasury curve bull-steepened after geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while traders also cited increasing expectations of Fed rate cuts pushing shorter-dated yields lower. 2-year yields came in by over 6bps, while longer-dated yields were around 2.5bps lower. The US Treasury auctioned 30-year debt, stopping through the screens by 0.4bps, while cover rose vs recent averages and the prior auction; the foreign bid remained (as was seen in all auctions this week), with indirect participation remaining above the previous auction as well as recent averages. Friday’s retail sales data is the final piece of the data puzzle ahead of next week’s FOMC meeting; markets are pricing a 28% chance of a rate cut at the June meeting (which comes ahead of the G20 on 28-29th June, which will set the tone for trade wars, and global growth expectations); accordingly there is more aggressive pricing for a July rate cut, which is now over 100% implied, according to money markets, suggesting that the market is increasingly pricing in the possibility of a 50bps rate cut, instead of the ‘usual’ 25bps. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with 2s30s steepening by 3.5bps.
