(Newswires)</p><p>EU Brexit negotiators have told UK Attorney General Cox to rework his backstop proposals and return for further talks on Friday in Brussels according to EU Diplomats, while it was also reported that EU are now sceptical that a Brexit deal can be achieved before the March 21st summit and that bloc are trying to prevent direct negotiations between the EU 27 leaders and UK PM May.

ECB said new TLTRO will be launched starting September 2019 each with a maturity of two-years and that the new operations will help preserve favourable bank lending conditions.</p><p>ECB’s Draghi repeated ECB stands ready to adjust all instruments and that the ECB has confidence that inflation will converge to target although thinks it will take longer to get there. Draghi also commented that growth risks are tilted to the downside, underlying inflation is muted and weakening momentum is slowing inflation convergence.</p><p>ECB sources said the ECB opted for more radical easing measures only after growth projections appeared bigger than feared slowdown and that hawks gave little resistance, conceded that delaying decisions until April was non-sensical.</p><p>Some analysts suggested that the details of the new TLTRO are not as favourable as hoped for and noted that the TLTROs were more targeted than expected, \"not the most favourable ones with variable rate indexed MRO and 2-year maturity\".

In related news, a US official said they need to see meaningful and verifiable action regarding denuclearization from North Korea soon and that the magnitude 2.1 tremor in North Korea is not causing us alarm.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MARKET RECAP</p><p>Allergan (AGN) surged on Thursday’s open despite a drug trial failure which caused it to tank in premarket trade, although this was widely expected, which could explain the bounce. General Electric (GE) opened higher after announcing the potential sale of its stake in a renewable energy JV. Kroger (KR) nosedived on the back of its earnings report, where it disappointed estimates, lowered guidance and announced increased capex. The financials sector (BAC, JPM, MS, C) was a weight on indices after the announcement of fresh stimulus from the ECB; this dovish initiative lowred rates which conversely benefitted REITs and homebuilders. CenturyLink (CTL) was an outperformer after a law suit has been filed against it, by a law firm backed by shareholders. Chipmakers (AMD, NVDA, AVGO, QCOM, INTC) legged lower after Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics halted chip production and warned of a China slowdown. FedEx (FDX) underperformed following a price target and Q3 EPS estimate cut at Citigroup. SPX -0.81% at 2749, NDX -1.20% at 7027, DJI -0.79% at 25472.</p><p>The Treasury complex took its cue from European govvies, after the ECB over-delivered, pushing back its timeline to lift rates and announcing another round of liquidity measures. Yields were lower by between 4bps and 6bps, at settlement, led by the belly. A bout of profit-taking after the European close did little to halt the march higher, which was further aided by the slide in US stocks. The stock slide seemed to stabilise around half an hour before the cash close, which lent some negative ticks to the T-Note. Friday's payrolls is now the next major catalyst for the complex. US T-note futures (M9) settled 16 ticks higher at 122-21.</p>",

In terms of the specifics, on the funding front, the ECB unveiled a new TLTRO (quarterly frequency) from September 2019 until March 2021, at the refi rate and no longer at the deposit rate. ING note that the announcement “is not an attempt to provide additional easing but rather an attempt to keep the balance sheet stable for a longer-than-expected period”. From a rates perspective, policymakers state that rates are “to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019” vs. Prev. guidance of “through summer 2019”; note, markets current price in 5.25bps worth of tightening this year. The need for such adjustments were reflected in the Bank’s latest round of macro projections with 2019 growth cut aggressively to 1.1% from 1.7% and 2020 lowered to 1.6% from 1.7%; risks to the Eurozone growth outlook are seen as “tilted to the downside”. On the inflation front, 2019 HICP was cut to 1.2% from 1.6%, 2020 lowered to 1.5% from 1.7% and 2021 lowered to 1.6% from 1.8% and thus notably below the ECB’s 2% target over a two year time horizon, with Draghi admitting that inflation will take longer to hit target. Today’s decisions were taken with a unanimous vote, albeit several governing council members floated the idea of pushing back rate guidance even further until March 2020. Overall, ING concludes that Draghi appears to hope that “today’s measure are sufficient to put a floor under the current economic slowdown”, adding that “any next step from here to tackle a severe downswing of the economy would now require unprecedented measures”.</p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES:</strong> As is customary post-ECB meeting, sources offered more clarity on the developments. One newswire quoted sources as saying that some at the ECB thought the 2019 outlook cut did not go far enough; Draghi is said to have pushed for ECB stimulus package; ECB not going to be rushing for TLTRO details as soon as April, mulling TLTRO rate at a premium over benchmark. Another newswire quoted sources as saying the ECB opted for more radical easing measures only after growth projections appeared bigger than feared slowdown; hawks gave little resistance, conceded that delaying decisions until April was non-sensical.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed’s Brainard (voter, dove) said increases in risks warrant downward revision of the rate path, even if economic outlook stays the same. With balance sheet normalisation in advanced stages, Brainard suggested that the Fed should wind down redemptions later this year. She added that the Fed would not want to cut rates and cut the balance sheet at the same time. Brainard said that inflation trends might be below the committees objective; Fed should be attentive to risk of downside erosion in inflation expectations.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: US NONFARM PAYROLLS (FEB 2019) </strong>After January’s blockbuster report, analysts forecast headline nonfarm payrolls will revert to a sub-trend-like pace of 180k (12-month average: 234k, 6-month average: 232k, 3-month average: 241k), with the fall to norms due to more seasonal temperatures weighing on weather-sensitive industries. Survey quirks may contribute to firmer wage growth, which could tick up to a pace last seen in 2009. The BLS will release the February Employment Situation Report at 1330 GMT/0830 EST on 8 March 2019.

On the neutral rates, she said the bank’s staff are looking to see if the neutral rate range needs to change. Patterson expects growth to pick up this year however due to a tighter labour market and rising wages. Traders had looked to today's update from BOC's Patterson to clarify whether the BOC dropping its hiking bias was a pause while it assess how economic conditions evolve, or was it a signal that rates had reached the terminal rate of the cycle. As such, Patterson's comments offer little clarity on this theme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Ahead of next week's Meaningful Votes, EU reportedly made a new offer to the UK after rejecting the UK’s proposals on the backstop, though the offer fell short of UK demands, and the EU is said to be waiting for another offer. There were no meaningful details included in the report, though GBP temporarily saw a bounce. Earlier, reports suggested that EU Brexit negotiators told UK Attorney General Cox to rework his backstop proposals and return for further talks on Friday in Brussels, according to EU Diplomats, who added that Cox's proposal for a mini-backstop did not include a referral to EU's top court, which is not acceptable for the EU (the mini-backstop would envisage fewer Irish border checks than are already seen within the EU-UK withdrawal deal). The report also said the EU is now sceptical that a Brexit deal can be achieved before the March 21st summit, and the bloc is trying to prevent direct negotiations between the EU 27 leaders and UK PM May. Regarding next week's votes, the Telegraph reports that the govt is likely to lose by over 100 votes following the lack of progress made with the EU in talks this week, an unnamed source told the newspaper. Sky later reported that there have been discussions at the top of govt over whether UK should push more than one Meaningful Vote next week, to which a spokesperson later said the votes are still on the slate. Elsewhere, a UK govt source said there was currently little to suggest that anything is going to change with the EU in the next 48 hours. There is a possibility that EC President Juncker will meet UK PM May before next week's vote.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLED USD 0.44 HIGHER AT USD 56.66/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLED 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 66.30/BBL. </strong>The crude complex moved higher on Thursday despite downward pressure from the downbeat ECB policy meeting. Prices got off on a strong footing overnight and in early trade, taking its cue from RBOB following Wednesday’s draw reported by the DOE. Brent and WTI reaching USD 67 and USD 57 respectively. However, some gains were pared back after the ECB cut its growth/inflation outlook, causing risk assets to sell-off. In supply related news, Libya’s 315k BPD capacity Sharara oilfield reported production rising throughout the day with the latest update from the NOC announcing output at 135k BPD as it looks to combat technical and manpower issues following the lift of the force majeure. Elsewhere, a Platts survey reported OPEC production falling by 60k BPD in February, with Saudi producing at 10.15mln BPD, and 79% compliance from OPEC members.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.81% at 2749, NDX -1.20% at 7027, DJI -0.79% at 25472. SECTORS: Energy -0.58%, Materials -0.89%, Industrials -0.59%, Cons Discretionary -1.37%, Cons Staples -0.56%, Healthcare -0.79%, Financials -1.07%, Tech -0.92%, Telecoms -0.81%, Utilities +0.27%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Allergan (AGN) surged on Thursday’s open despite a drug trial failure which caused it to tank in premarket trade, although this was widely expected, which could explain the bounce. General Electric (GE) opened higher after announcing the potential sale of its stake in a renewable energy JV. Kroger (KR) nosedived on the back of its earnings report, where it disappointed estimates, lowered guidance and announced increased capex. The financials sector (BAC, JPM, MS, C) was a weight on indices after the announcement of fresh stimulus from the ECB; this dovish initiative lowred rates which conversely benefitted REITs and homebuilders. CenturyLink (CTL) was an outperformer after a law suit has been filed against it, by a law firm backed by shareholders. Chipmakers (AMD, NVDA, AVGO, QCOM, INTC) legged lower after Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics halted chip production and warned of a China slowdown. FedEx (FDX) underperformed following a price target and Q3 EPS estimate cut at Citigroup.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 16 TICKS HIGHER AT 122-21. </strong>The Treasury complex took its cue from European govvies, after the ECB over-delivered, pushing back its timeline to lift rates and announcing another round of liquidity measures. Yields were lower by between 4bps and 6bps, at settlement, led by the belly. A bout of profit-taking after the European close did little to halt the march higher, which was further aided by the slide in US stocks. The stock slide seemed to stabilise around half an hour before the cash close, which lent some negative ticks to the T-Note. Friday's payrolls is now the next major catalyst for the complex.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The ECB cut growth forecasts and indicated rates would be on hold through 2019 (previously it had guided it would be on hold through summer). The central bank over-delivered in that sense, since it announced fresh liquidity measures as well. Initially, the EUR struggled to fall after the announcement, as traders digested the details, but by the time Draghi began his press conference, the EUR was knocking around 12.50. SocGen notes that EURUSD had previously declined on seven of the last eight ECB meetings, and today's 0.6% fall in in sync with that pattern. \"It is also the third largest daily decline this year, and the retreat below 1.1250 guides the pair closer to the 1.1216 low of last November,\" the bank says, adding that with Brexit discussions deadlocked and tough US/EU tariff negotiations still to come this spring, who would rule out a pullback to 1.10?\"</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Haven demand ahead of the ECB and Friday's Payrolls report out of the US kept JPY with a slight positive bias. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said today that it is time to turn risk-bearish, and recommended buying the JPY to prepare for a bigger setback in higher-yielding currencies; the bank notes that equity markets have rolled over, declining for four days in a row as liquidity conditions have turned less supportive. \"Concretely, the US Treasury's rundown of its cash balance, adding about US$200bn into US money markets, seems to have run its course,\" MS says, \"the US Treasury-induced liquidity-add started in early February, boosting private sector deposit holdings and finding its way from here into financial markets, pushing equity prices higher.\" The bank says this liquidity support is not set to reverse as the Treasury will have to rebuild its cash balance over the next few weeks. \"Liquidity and funding availability drive asset volatility and valuations. The relationship between liquidity and asset valuations is positive, but naturally not linear. The higher the valuation, the more liquidity may be required to push valuation higher, all else equal.\"</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> A lack of updates on the China trade talks front, and nothing major on the data slate left the buck taking its cues from events in Europe, and more specifically, the EUR's slide post-ECB.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> Traders had looked to today's update from BOC's Patterson to clarify whether the BOC dropping its hiking bias was really just a pause while it assess how economic conditions evolve, or was it a signal that rates had reached the terminal rate of the cycle. The former would keep traders minded to CAD strength on the horizon, while the latter could signal limited upside ahead. As such, Patterson's comments offered little clarity on this theme. There was a small hint that it could be a pause when Patterson said the BOC needs to see more data to know if the weakness seen in the economy was temporary or more persistent; but despite this, CAD fell to lows last seen in January, perhaps influenced by her remarks that the BOC staff are looking to see if the neutral rate level needed to change.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> With only limited progress made in discussions with the EU, ahead of next week's Meaningful Votes in Parliament, and another wave of negative Brexit news flow, sterling traded lower, breaching 1.31, before consolidating around the figure. There was some sympathy with the EUR too, which was hammered post-ECB. Sterling attempted to pare back losses on a report that the EU had made a new offer to the UK, though details were scant, and the rally could not be sustained, leaving sterling continuing to linger in negative territory. Ahead of the key votes next week, HSBC notes that option volatilities for GBP are now creeping up, too. \"A vote to exit the EU without a deal would see GBPUSD fall dramatically, we believe, possibly to as low as 1.10, and some MPs have suggested a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to the current terms,\" HSBC said, \"on the flipside, a longer than three-month extension could see GBP rise, as it might raise the possibility of a second referendum and potentially a no-Brexit scenario.\" HSBC also adds that a soft Brexit with a deal would also be positive for GBP, we expect, but less so than a no Brexit outcome. Looking ahead, the bank sees the weighted probabilities of these outcomes pushing GBP to 1.37 by year-end.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Aussie watchers will have noticed that since Nov/Dec 2018, the trade-weighted Aussie dollar has been diverging from that of the Shanghai Composite. The domestic drivers of the Aussie were on full display this week, when a weak GDP report for Q4 led to a raft of banks flurrying to cut their RBA rate views; overnight, weak retail but firm trade data meant the Aussie didn't travel very far above the 0.7025 low on Weds. The bods at BAML are now warning their clients not to overlook external factors - namely, China. \"Nowhere is this more evident than in the recent decoupling between the Chinese stock market and AUD,\" BAML says. \"We consider the broader question of whether AUD is a high beta currency [BAML questions this, given that the AUD has not been a carry currency for some time] and more specifically whether China matters [BAML believes it still does].\" BAML explains that with China recently signalling more easing to come, watching high frequency indicators of its import impulse for Australia will be important. \"So far commodity shipment and steel production data paint a neutral impulse, which suggests the bearish domestic narrative will continue to dominate near term. However, a likely recovery in Chinese growth later this year keeps us comfortable with projecting medium-term AUD appreciation,\" BAML says. The bank notes that the segment's contribution to net exports is unlikely to be as high as it was a few years ago, though it does observe that it does argue that it is already proving a buffer to the slowdown in domestic demand, \"one that is likely to strengthen if commodity-intensive as well as consumer sectors in China recover, both of which matter for Australia's bulk and service sector exports.\"</p><p><strong>* MXN:</strong> Consumer prices data were unchanged on the month, but the YY fell to 3.9% from 4.4% (cons. 4.0%). The MXN was trading softer against the buck, though it is worth noting that EMFX in general was trading with an offered tone on Thursday. In terms of the impact on Mexican monetary policy, \"a combination of low currency pass-through and modest demand-related pressures finally is pushing headline inflation to its lowest rate since January 2017,\" Pantheon Macro observes, adding it expects \"this downtrend to continue in Q2, gradually laying the ground for a dovish Banxico and eventual rate cuts in late Q3.\"</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Dollar-rand rose to levels last seen at the beginning of the year, helped by USD strength pressuring the EMFX complex, but also news that South African regulators granted state utility Eskom above-inflation price rises over the next three years, but fell short of the levels that Eskom had requested, sending USDZAR to 14.53+. Separately, analysts see the ran at 14.20 against the buck in 12-months, according to a Reuters poll – that forecast was raised from the 13.85 in the Feb poll.</p>",

        "subject": "FX ANALYSIS: Euro drops below 1.12 after ECB over-delivers",
        "content": "<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The ECB cut growth forecasts and indicated rates would be on hold through 2019 (previously it had guided it would be on hold through summer). The central bank over-delivered in that sense, since it announced fresh liquidity measures as well. Initially, the EUR struggled to fall after the announcement, as traders digested the details, but by the time Draghi began his press conference, the EUR was knocking around 12.50. SocGen notes that EURUSD had previously declined on seven of the last eight ECB meetings, and today's 0.6% fall in in sync with that pattern. \"It is also the third largest daily decline this year, and the retreat below 1.1250 guides the pair closer to the 1.1216 low of last November,\" the bank says, adding that with Brexit discussions deadlocked and tough US/EU tariff negotiations still to come this spring, who would rule out a pullback to 1.10?\"</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Haven demand ahead of the ECB and Friday's Payrolls report out of the US kept JPY with a slight positive bias. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said today that it is time to turn risk-bearish, and recommended buying the JPY to prepare for a bigger setback in higher-yielding currencies; the bank notes that equity markets have rolled over, declining for four days in a row as liquidity conditions have turned less supportive. \"Concretely, the US Treasury's rundown of its cash balance, adding about US$200bn into US money markets, seems to have run its course,\" MS says, \"the US Treasury-induced liquidity-add started in early February, boosting private sector deposit holdings and finding its way from here into financial markets, pushing equity prices higher.\" The bank says this liquidity support is not set to reverse as the Treasury will have to rebuild its cash balance over the next few weeks. \"Liquidity and funding availability drive asset volatility and valuations. The relationship between liquidity and asset valuations is positive, but naturally not linear. The higher the valuation, the more liquidity may be required to push valuation higher, all else equal.\"</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> A lack of updates on the China trade talks front, and nothing major on the data slate left the buck taking its cues from events in Europe, and more specifically, the EUR's slide post-ECB.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> Traders had looked to today's update from BOC's Patterson to clarify whether the BOC dropping its hiking bias was really just a pause while it assess how economic conditions evolve, or was it a signal that rates had reached the terminal rate of the cycle. The former would keep traders minded to CAD strength on the horizon, while the latter could signal limited upside ahead. As such, Patterson's comments offered little clarity on this theme. There was a small hint that it could be a pause when Patterson said the BOC needs to see more data to know if the weakness seen in the economy was temporary or more persistent; but despite this, CAD fell to lows last seen in January, perhaps influenced by her remarks that the BOC staff are looking to see if the neutral rate level needed to change.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> With only limited progress made in discussions with the EU, ahead of next week's Meaningful Votes in Parliament, and another wave of negative Brexit news flow, sterling traded lower, breaching 1.31, before consolidating around the figure. There was some sympathy with the EUR too, which was hammered post-ECB. Sterling attempted to pare back losses on a report that the EU had made a new offer to the UK, though details were scant, and the rally could not be sustained, leaving sterling continuing to linger in negative territory. Ahead of the key votes next week, HSBC notes that option volatilities for GBP are now creeping up, too. \"A vote to exit the EU without a deal would see GBPUSD fall dramatically, we believe, possibly to as low as 1.10, and some MPs have suggested a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to the current terms,\" HSBC said, \"on the flipside, a longer than three-month extension could see GBP rise, as it might raise the possibility of a second referendum and potentially a no-Brexit scenario.\" HSBC also adds that a soft Brexit with a deal would also be positive for GBP, we expect, but less so than a no Brexit outcome. Looking ahead, the bank sees the weighted probabilities of these outcomes pushing GBP to 1.37 by year-end.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Aussie watchers will have noticed that since Nov/Dec 2018, the trade-weighted Aussie dollar has been diverging from that of the Shanghai Composite. The domestic drivers of the Aussie were on full display this week, when a weak GDP report for Q4 led to a raft of banks flurrying to cut their RBA rate views; overnight, weak retail but firm trade data meant the Aussie didn't travel very far above the 0.7025 low on Weds. The bods at BAML are now warning their clients not to overlook external factors - namely, China. \"Nowhere is this more evident than in the recent decoupling between the Chinese stock market and AUD,\" BAML says. \"We consider the broader question of whether AUD is a high beta currency [BAML questions this, given that the AUD has not been a carry currency for some time] and more specifically whether China matters [BAML believes it still does].\" BAML explains that with China recently signalling more easing to come, watching high frequency indicators of its import impulse for Australia will be important. \"So far commodity shipment and steel production data paint a neutral impulse, which suggests the bearish domestic narrative will continue to dominate near term. However, a likely recovery in Chinese growth later this year keeps us comfortable with projecting medium-term AUD appreciation,\" BAML says. The bank notes that the segment's contribution to net exports is unlikely to be as high as it was a few years ago, though it does observe that it does argue that it is already proving a buffer to the slowdown in domestic demand, \"one that is likely to strengthen if commodity-intensive as well as consumer sectors in China recover, both of which matter for Australia's bulk and service sector exports.\"</p><p><strong>* MXN:</strong> Consumer prices data were unchanged on the month, but the YY fell to 3.9% from 4.4% (cons. 4.0%). The MXN was trading softer against the buck, though it is worth noting that EMFX in general was trading with an offered tone on Thursday. In terms of the impact on Mexican monetary policy, \"a combination of low currency pass-through and modest demand-related pressures finally is pushing headline inflation to its lowest rate since January 2017,\" Pantheon Macro observes, adding it expects \"this downtrend to continue in Q2, gradually laying the ground for a dovish Banxico and eventual rate cuts in late Q3.\"</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Dollar-rand rose to levels last seen at the beginning of the year, helped by USD strength pressuring the EMFX complex, but also news that South African regulators granted state utility Eskom above-inflation price rises over the next three years, but fell short of the levels that Eskom had requested, sending USDZAR to 14.53+. Separately, analysts see the ran at 14.20 against the buck in 12-months, according to a Reuters poll – that forecast was raised from the 13.85 in the Feb poll.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>It took some time and more than one attempt, but the single currency’s resolve and vice like grip of 1.1300 vs the Dollar was finally broken by the ECB’s dovish policy decisions, including a 3rd tranche of TLTROs to be offered every 3 months from September this year through March 21, at least, and each with a 2 year maturity, plus a push back on the (likely, or highly unlikely now some might say) timing of a first rate from through Summer 2019 to the end of the year at the earliest. Eur/Usd breached recent sub-big figure support levels and only stalled for a while around 1.1250 where 2 bn option expiries resided before declining further as President Draghi presented the case for the aforementioned liquidity additions and guidance tweak via a more downbeat economic assessment, not to mention hefty GDP and CPI downgrades in the latest Staff projections. Eur/Usd is now taking a good look at stops said to be in place around 1.1235 and the ytd low, but 1.1216 looks vulnerable as the next downside tech support protecting 1.1200 and 1.1187, especially as the single succumbs to all round selling pressure and particularly vs the Jpy.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The other major loser, and partly in sympathy with the Eur, but also as the Brexit saga rumbles on with no sign of an end in sight as EU diplomats are reportedly sceptical about striking a deal in time for the March 21-22 Summit let alone next week’s pivotal UK Parliamentary votes. Cable slumped to a new recent base below 1.3100 as a result, albeit marginal, as Eur/Gbp retreated through 0.8600 again on the aforementioned more pronounced Euro depreciation.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Markedly mixed fortunes for the safe havens as the Jpy pares more losses towards 111.50 vs the Greenback, but was hampered somewhat by decent layered option expiries and the proximity of a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (111.39). Conversely, the Franc is floundering as the Buck benefits from the demise of others and <strong>DXY</strong> establishes a considerably firmer footing above 97.000 (97.377 at one stage), and with the aid of some upbeat data, as Usd/Chf rebounds towards 1.0100. NB, Eur/Chf has slipped simultaneously to 1.1320.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Against the backdrop of broadly risk-off sentiment (due to heightened global growth concerns/risks and geopolitical tensions), the Rand significantly underperformed as SA President Ramaphosa pressed ahead with plans to nationalise the SARB under the guise of greater sovereignty. Indeed, Usd/Zar soared to just over 14.8400 vs 14.2100 at the other extreme for a 1+% rally vs an average of 0.5% or so across the region.</p>",

Sectors are mixed, with some underperformance seen in material names, with the sector likely weighed on by growth concerns; interestingly, there was a report from a Washington think tank which stated that China’s economy is around 12% smaller than the official figure. Notable movers this morning include, Rio Tinto (-7.3%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after being downgraded to sell at Societe Generale. Dialog Semiconductor (-0.8%) are also in the red weighed on by the poor performance of Japanese listed Renesas who fell by 15% following Nikkei reports that the Co. are temporarily halting 13/14 of their production facilities amidst uncertainty in China.

Nevertheless, the Kiwi and Aussie have clambered off recent lows to sit a bit more comfortably above 0.6750 and 0.7000 respectively as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds towards 1.0400.</p><p>CAD - The other main non-US Dollar has also gleaned some much needed traction after yesterday’s post-BoC slide, but remains precarious within a 1.3425-50 range vs the Greenback as attention turns to the upcoming EPR presented by Deputy Governor Patterson that could underscore the more dovish or uncertain outlook in terms of the timing of policy normalisation.</p><p>CHF/EUR/JPY/GBP - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, and as noted above all broadly stuck in tight confines with the Franc meandering between 1.0040-55 and single currency rooted to 1.1300, albeit hovering just above the big figure following recent breaches below that threatened a steeper decline. Of course, a dovish ECB later may yet see the Euro buckle completely, but technically it remains resilient vs the Dollar having held above Fib support around 1.1305. Note also, big option expiries could limit moves post-ECB, at least into the NY cut, as 2 bn sits at 1.1250 and a mega 3.7 bn from 1.1360-80, if the ECB disappoints – for a full preview of the March policy meeting check out the Research Suite. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy looks increasingly capped around 112.00 after several attempted breakouts, but again hefty expiries may keep the headline pair contained given a series of 1 bn options stacked all the way down to 111.25-35 (just above the 200 DMA at 111.39) and 1.5 bn from 112.00-05.

However, core debt may also be deriving mild support from the recent slippage across EU bourses in the run up to the ECB, as Gilts are grinding higher as well. Whatever the precise rationale or catalyst, new highs for the EU benchmarks are 163.73 and 126.87 respectively (+18 and +21 ticks vs -12 and -10 ticks at one stage) to expose 163.93 and 126.94 on any follow through.

Moreover, extremely rangebound trade overall/elsewhere somewhat flatter the actual extent of the recoveries that only equate to between 0.15-0.2% vs the Usd. Nevertheless, the Kiwi and Aussie have clambered off recent lows to sit a bit more comfortably above 0.6750 and 0.7000 respectively as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds towards 1.0400.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The other main non-US Dollar has also gleaned some much needed traction after yesterday’s post-BoC slide, but remains precarious within a 1.3425-50 range vs the Greenback as attention turns to the upcoming EPR presented by Deputy Governor Patterson that could underscore the more dovish or uncertain outlook in terms of the timing of policy normalisation.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/GBP</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, and as noted above all broadly stuck in tight confines with the Franc meandering between 1.0040-55 and single currency rooted to 1.1300, albeit hovering just above the big figure following recent breaches below that threatened a steeper decline. Of course, a dovish ECB later may yet see the Euro buckle completely, but technically it remains resilient vs the Dollar having held above Fib support around 1.1305. Note also, big option expiries could limit moves post-ECB, at least into the NY cut, as 2 bn sits at 1.1250 and a mega 3.7 bn from 1.1360-80, if the ECB disappoints – for a full preview of the March policy meeting check out the Research Suite. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy looks increasingly capped around 112.00 after several attempted breakouts, but again hefty expiries may keep the headline pair contained given a series of 1 bn options stacked all the way down to 111.25-35 (just above the 200 DMA at 111.39) and 1.5 bn from 112.00-05. Turning to Cable, 1.3200-1.3100 essentially covers the recent range with moves towards the top or bottom correlating closely with the tone regarding ongoing Brexit negotiations.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona has retreated from circa 10.5000 vs the Eur to a low just shy of 10.5600 in wake of comments from Riksbank Governor Ingves that could arguably be perceived as more ambiguous with regard to guidance for another 25 bp repo rate hike in H1 this year. Conversely, the Nok has not been unduly upset by a significant miss in Norwegian manufacturing output and remains around 9.8000 vs the Eur, perhaps with some support from firmer oil prices.</p>",

Looking at Liffe price moves thus far, the 10 year bond started at 126.59 and dipped a little further below its 126.66 previous settlement to 126.56 before regrouping, but has topped out at 126.79, with the 3 month strip also tailing off somewhat having climbed between 0.5 and 2.5 ticks above par at one stage. Turning to Brexit, breakthrough optimism has turned into pessimism all too swiftly again, so it would be clutching at straws to expect anything on that front today or Friday, leaving the focus firmly on events elsewhere, like the ECB and NFP for the remainder of the week.</p>",

As such, <strong>EUR/USD </strong>retreated from early highs to test 1.1300 to the downside, with the aid of yesterday’s ECB sources and ahead of the ECB rate decision later today (Full preview available on the Research Suite). It is also worth keeping in mind a chunky 2.0bln in <strong>EUR/USD</strong> options expiring at strike 1.1250 at today’s NY cut. <strong>GBP/USD</strong> gained more ground above 1.3150 during early hours and the marginal <strong>EUR</strong> weakness alongside a pick-up in the greenback kept <strong>Cable</strong> afloat around 1.3180 throughout most of the session. <strong>EUR/GBP</strong> remained a laggard after dipping from around 0.8590 before finding some mild support at 0.8575. <strong>NZD</strong> stood as the G10 outperformer as it retraced some lost ground following yesterday’s Aussie-slump. <strong>NZD/USD</strong> breached its 100 DMA (at 0.6770) to the upside ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6796, while the <strong>Aussie</strong> moved higher in tandem, albeit to a lesser extent. The <strong>AUD/USD </strong>was briefly dented upon the release of below-forecast retail sales, although the wider-than-expected trade surplus somewhat helped the currency resurface. UBS became the latest bank to downgrade its RBA rate forecast and now sees two back-to-back 25bps cuts in July and August this year vs. a prior view of one cut in November 2019 and one in Q1 2020. <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> benefitted from marginal safe-haven flows amidst the overall risk-averse tone. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> resided in a range of 111.60-80 ahead of its 100 and 200 DMAs at 111.40 and 111.37 respectively. In the EM FX space, <strong>USD/INR</strong> fell below 69.00 (vs. an open just below 71.00) to levels last seen in early January after it breached its 200 DMA to the downside ahead if its 50 WMA at 69.77.</p><p><strong>Australian Retail Sales MM Jan 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. -0.4%) (Newswires) Australian Trade Balance (A$) Jan 4.549B vs. Exp. 3.0B (Prev. 3.681B)</strong></p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The energy complex posted modest gains as prices retraced some of the recent losses, although some desks are attributing the upside to OPEC output curbs and renewed concerns surrounding Iranian/Venezuelan sanctions. <strong>WTI futures</strong> advanced further above USD 56.00bbl but upside is capped as US output remains at a record high. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> remained in a tight range ahead of this week’s key risk events, whilst <strong>copper</strong> remained subdued from yesterday’s OECD global growth cut. Finally, Shanghai <strong>aluminium</strong> hit a near three-week low after falling for the third consecutive day due to rising inventories and worries from the Chinese demand side.</p><p><strong>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih reportedly said that the Kingdom is exporting around 7-8mln BPD of crude; according to Saudi press citing the Energy Minister.

(FT)</p><p>NORTH AMERICA</p><p>Nomura's quant desk has noted the sluggishness in the global rates market. \"CTAs seem to have reduced their long positions on the major DM bond futures market, but systematic selling pressure in bond futures is relatively subdued,\" noting that \"for 10-year US Treasuries, CTAs' net position on the 10-year UST futures (TY) is close to 'flat' or slightly short,\" and that \"as downward price momentum in TY is not so strong, systematic trend-followers have currently refrained from chasing market downside by adding short positions.\" That sluggishness was not apparent today, and Treasuries bull steepened as equities dropped on reported CTA selling. Today's price action seemed sentiment driven rather than event driven, with more timely reminders about the slowing global growth narrative (OECD cut outlook on Weds, BOC talked about uncertainties, Aussie GDP was soft overnight, the Beige Book mentions of \"slow\"). There was talk of CTA buying after a dovish ECB sources story.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks are mostly lower following a three-day losing streak on Wall Street where the major indices fell to a three-week low, with traders attributing the downside to growth concerns. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is kept afloat by its telecom and utilities sectors, although upside is capped by the underperformance of its heavyweight metals and mining names. Meanwhile, Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) gave up the 21,500 level as domestic currency gains weighs on the Japanese index. Furthermore, Renesas fell over 15% after Nikkei reported the company is to temporarily halt operations at 13 of its 14 production facilities amid uncertainty in China, thus Japanese chipmakers are hit in sympathy. Elsewhere Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are conforming to the overall risk tone with the former pressured by Geely shares after the company fell over 3.5% amid dismal February sales.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY has retreated from the prior session’s highs of 96.900 as traders in Asia digested the US record high trade deficit. As such, EUR/USD edged higher and briefly hovered around 1.1350 ahead of the ECB rate decision later today. Meanwhile the softer greenback also aided GBP/USD to gain more ground above 1.3150. Elsewhere, NZD stands at the G10 outperformer as it retraces some lost ground following yesterday’s Aussie-slump. NZD/USD breached its 100 DMA (at 0.6770) to the upside ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6796, while the Aussie moves higher in tandem, albeit to a lesser extent. UBS became the latest bank to downgrade its RBA rate forecast and now sees two back-to-back 25bps cuts in July and August this year vs. a prior view of one cut in November 2019 and one in Q1 2020. Furthermore, the AUD/USD was briefly dented upon the release of below-forecast retail sales, although the wider-than-expected trade surplus somewhat helped the currency resurface. Finally, JPY and CHF are benefitting from the pullback in the buck, alongside marginal safe-haven flows amidst the overall risk-averse tone. USD/JPY resides around 111.60 ahead of its 100 and 200 DMAs at 111.40 and 111.37 respectively.</p>",
