Raytheon and Boeing shares moved both moved higher. Kraft Heinz (KHC) advanced after the co announced that the company's internal investigation into its procurement area and assessment of internal controls is complete, and the food maker continues to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation. Salesforce.com (CRM) shares were hit after the co. announced plans to buy Tableau Software Inc (DATA) for an enterprise value of USD 15.7bln in an all-stock deal (whose stock price skyrocketed). Financials (C, JPM, WFC, GS, BAC) benefitted from a rising yield environment. Analog Devices Inc (ADI) advanced after an analyst at Goldman Sachs gave the semiconductor company a double upgrade to buy from sell. Insys Therapeutics (INSY) lost nearly half of its market cap after the drug maker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the co. allegedly paid bribes to doctors who prescribed a specific opioid medication. LyondellBasell (LYB) jumped higher after saying it launched a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to purchase as much as 37M ordinary shares. The casino sector had a good day; Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) all moved higher after Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation for the Macau sector.

However, some attribute higher yields to positioning ahead of this week’s supply, with attention on whether foreign buyers are willing to scoop up Treasuries at the recently lower yields. Additionally, some will be mindful of the FOMC meeting next week, and for any nod to the recent dovish pricing of the FOMC rate trajectory (will the Fed shift from neutral to an easing bias?). There is also the CPI report on Wednesday, where a lower print might squash yields down towards the bottom of the recent ranges; conversely, CPI above expectations and a strong retail sales report (Friday) could provide a hurdle to the bullish thesis running in Treasuries. Monday also saw a large amount of corporate; IFR noted that high grade supply looked set to head towards USD 15bln or more on the day. At settlement, yields at the belly of the curve saw the most pronounced move, 10-year yield up just over 6bps, with the 2s/10s steepening c. 1.1bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled 14+ ticks lower at 126-14.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites up, Treasuries down, Dollar up, Crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> US President Trump threatens more tariffs if no meeting with Xi at G20, US/Mexico strike a deal over weekend and tariffs averted, Treasury Sec Mnuchin says Huawei ban could be lifted in event of a deal, Sources suggest ECB may be ready for more cuts, US mulling further Iran sanctions, JOLTS consistent with labour market slowdown, Weak UK GDP, BoE’s Saunders fairly Hawkish</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>JN Broad Money, AU Business Conditions, UK employment data, US Business Optimism, PPI final, API Weekly Inventories, NZ Electric Card Retail Sales, ECB’s Nowotny, Rehn, BoE’s Vlieghe, Tenreyro</p><p><strong>* TRUMP INTERVIEW:</strong> In a wide-ranging live interview on CNBC, US President Trump said the trade deal with China will work out because tariffs are powerful tool. He suggested that China will make a deal because 'they will have to make a deal'. He also accused china of devaluing the yuan in order to offset the impact of tariffs. Trump warned that if a deal was not made with China, then tariffs will rise; he also said that if China President Xi did not attend the G20, tariffs would be implemented on the USD 300bln of remaining Chinese imports. Trump hinted that he was due to meet Xi at the 28-29th June G20 meeting. Elsewhere, Trump critiqued the Fed again, saying it had made a mistake by raising rates while implementing QT.</p><p><strong>* MEXICO:</strong> US/Mexico struck a deal late Friday, averting US tariffs on Mexican goods imports. Details were thin (US President Trump has pledged to provide more colour), though watchers said the deal largely consists of actions that Mexico had already promised recently. Trump also suggested that, seemingly as part of the deal, Mexico will be raising purchases of US agricultural goods, though this was not explicit in the accord. Mexico’s Foreign Minister Ebrard later confirmed that agricultural purchases had not been part of the deal and noted that the deal also did not specify a target for the reduction of migrant flows. The deal has raised hopes that the US might take a similar approach to China negotiations, although the issues seem deeper, and more challenging to resolve, and as such, hurdles remain high.</p><p><strong>* G20:</strong> G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Chiefs joint communique stated they pledge to use all the policies they can to protect global growth from disruptions due to trade and other tensions, while it added that risks from trade and geopolitical tensions are \"intensifying\". Moreover, the ministers agreed to create common rules to close loopholes used by global tech giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), to reduce their corporate taxes, as stated in a final communique.</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has suggested that US could ease sanctions on Huawei if US President Trump secured guarantees from the Chinese government. The remarks are in keeping with the position of US President Trump’s, who has previously suggested that the telecoms giant could be included as part of a trade deal with China. The Treasury Secretary also said it was no coincidence that Chinese policymakers had allowed the yuan to weaken, of late. Later in the session, the US State Department expressed its “grave concern” over Hong Kong's proposed extradition law, against which hundreds of thousands of protestors marched over the weekend.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>Turkey is still pressing forward with its plans to acquire Russia’s S-400 missile defence system, in a move which will strain tensions between the White House and Ankara. Turkey said the US had not taken any steps to participate in the proposed bilateral study of the S-400. It is now becoming more likely that the US will evict Turkey from the F-35 jet training programme, as it had previously threatened. Elsewhere, UN Nuclear Watchdog Chief Amano stated that Iran's rate of production of enriched uranium is now increasing. This came shortly after comments from the Iran Foreign Ministry suggested that the EU has not taken practical measures to revive the Nuclear Deal (which despite the US’ opposition to the deal, Iran is pressing on Europe to maintain it). Later reports emerged that the US government was mulling further Iran sanctions that would focus on Iran's special trade and finance institute (which works with Europe's Instex).</p><p><strong>* JOLTS JOB OPENINGS: </strong>April US JOLTS Job openings ticked slightly lower in April (7.449mln vs prev. 7.488mln), alongside seeing a negatively revised March figure to 7.474mln. Hires, however, jumped by 240k to a record high of 5.937mln, with the hires rate rising by 0.1ppts to 3.9%, the highest level since January. Separations also rose marginally to 5.578mln, but the rate remained unchanged. Looking at the longer-term trend these figures remain consistent with labour demand levelling off, and Wells Fargo have suggested that the slowdown noted in last week’s payrolls numbers have been offered further credence; but that the largely unchanged quits rate suggests that the labour market is not “falling off of the rails”.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE DATA:&nbsp; </strong>China’s<strong> t</strong>rade surplus widened, as imports fell more than forecast, but exports were slightly better than the Street had pencilled in. Exports to the US continue to decline, as do imports. The better exports data might be driven by front-loading, with Chinese exporters hoping to ship their goods before tariffs are raised on Chinese goods. Meanwhile, Chinese FX reserves rose to USD 3.101trln in April, a nine-month high. China CPI data due tomorrow and activity data at the end of the week are the next data points to watch.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the leading candidate to become Conservative Party leader, on the weekend threatened to withhold the GBP 39bln Brexit ‘divorce bill’ if no EU deal can be reached, also warning that there was a very small possibility that no deal can be found. Johnson also vowed to tear-up former UK PM May’s deal and re-open negotiations with the EU, contrary to the assertions from EU policymakers that this was not possible (currently, EU policymakers seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach as to how the leadership race turns out). Johnson also said he’d cut income tax for top earners, raising the top-rate 40% threshold to £80k were he elected. Meanwhile, UK GDP in April was weaker than anticipated, reflecting the front-loading stockpiling seen in Q1, and the data augurs poorly for the Q2 GDP print. Elsewhere, the EU is to warn businesses not to expect any help regarding a no-deal Brexit and urges them to prepare for the UK to crash out of the EU on October 31st. Finally, the conservative leadership election officially started on Monday. For a full-timetable of the election process, <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/timetable-for-the-next-uk-conservative-leadership-election-06-06-2019\">click here.</a></p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> The ECB is open to cutting the rates again if growth weakens in the rest of the year as a strong euro is hurting the bloc, according to two sources cited by Reuters. The report was followed by supported comments from the ECB’s Visco at the weekend G20 meeting. ECB President candidate Weidmann, however, said that there’s less scope for policy to react to the current slowdown in the euro area economy, and that policymakers should not delay normalisation.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BOE’s Haldane (hawk) wrote an op-ed stating that the central bank should consider higher rates to “nip any inflationary risks in the bud,” citing risks from to real pay. BOE’s Saunders (also typically hawkish) said that the BoE will likely need to return to neutral policy stance sooner than the market expects, which he said was around 2%, although tightening is likely to be limited and gradual. He said the MPC doesn't necessarily need to keep rates unchanged until Brexit uncertainties are resolved, and said that in the event of a no deal Brexit, rates could move in either direction. Saunders noted that when setting interest rates, the BoE should not just look at Brexit uncertainty but should look at growth and assess whether or not it is above or below potential. When asked about the recent GDP data, Saunders responded that the Bank has repeatedly said data is likely to be volatile (suggesting that the Bank will not place too much importance on one data point) whilst also stating that bankers had expected Q2 weakness as a result of the unwinding of Q1 stockpiling.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK’S TREASURY SUPPLY:</strong> The US will auction USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tue), 10-year (USD 24bln, Weds), 30-year (USD 16bln, Thu). With USD 24bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the supply will raise a net USD 54bln of new cash. TD Securities points out that the Fed’s portfolio run-off has slowed to USD 15bln in Treasuries, versus USD 30bln previous, however, with no SOMA maturities in the mid-month, the Fed is set to conduct its add-ons later in the month.</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong>&nbsp;Recent auctions have been mixed, with some desks suggesting that lower rates are a factor. With that said, recent speculation that the Fed could fire some “insurance” rate cuts might be supportive. Recent averages suggest we could see a tail at the 3-year auction of 0.3bps, with 61% buy-side takedown (16% to directs, and 45% to indirects).</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 14+ TICKS LOWER AT 126-14: </strong>Yields are higher across the curve, amid a more constructive risk tone after the US decided against implementing tariffs on Mexican imports. However, some attribute higher yields to positioning ahead of this week’s supply, with attention on whether foreign buyers are willing to scoop up Treasuries at the recently lower yields. Additionally, some will be mindful of the FOMC meeting next week, and for any nod to the recent dovish pricing of the FOMC rate trajectory (will the Fed shift from neutral to an easing bias?). There is also the CPI report on Wednesday, where a lower print might squash yields down towards the bottom of the recent ranges; conversely, CPI above expectations and a strong retail sales report (Friday) could provide a hurdle to the bullish thesis running in Treasuries. Monday also saw a large amount of corporate; IFR noted that high grade supply looked set to head towards USD 15bln or more on the day. At settlement, yields at the belly of the curve saw the most pronounced move, 10-year yield up just over 6bps, with the 2s/10s steepening c. 1.1bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.73 LOWER AT USD 53.26/BBL; BRENT (Q9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.00 LOWER AT USD 62.29/BBL:</strong> Energy markets drifted lower throughout the US session, failing to hold onto overnight gains. Prices initially got off on the front foot following US President Trump’s decision to not implement tariffs on Mexico. Russian officials said on Monday that they see extended downside for prices if supply cuts aren’t extended (citing USD 40/bbl and USD 30/bbl) and want a balanced oil market, essentially indicating to domestic producers to buckle up as they move towards falling in line with the rest of OPEC+.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.5% AT 2887, DOW JONES 1.1% AT 7502, NASDAQ-100 0.3% AT 26062; SECTORS</strong>: Consumer Discretionary 1.1%, Consumer Staples 0%, Energy 0.3%, Financials 0.9%, Health Care 0.3%, Industrials 0.1%, Information Technology 1%, Materials 0.1%, Telecommunication Services -0.2%, Utilities -0.6%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>United Technologies (UTX) reversed pre-market gains related to the defence contractors proposed tie up with Raytheon (RTN), as news emerged that Boeing (BA) are to review the merger. Raytheon and Boeing shares moved both moved higher. Kraft Heinz (KHC) advanced after the co announced that the company's internal investigation into its procurement area and assessment of internal controls is complete, and the food maker continues to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation. Salesforce.com (CRM) shares were hit after the co. announced plans to buy Tableau Software Inc (DATA) for an enterprise value of USD 15.7bln in an all-stock deal (whose stock price skyrocketed). Financials (C, JPM, WFC, GS, BAC) benefitted from a rising yield environment. Analog Devices Inc (ADI) advanced after an analyst at Goldman Sachs gave the semiconductor company a double upgrade to buy from sell. Insys Therapeutics (INSY) lost nearly half of its market cap after the drug maker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the co. allegedly paid bribes to doctors who prescribed a specific opioid medication. LyondellBasell (LYB) jumped higher after saying it launched a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to purchase as much as 37M ordinary shares. The casino sector had a good day; Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) all moved higher after Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation for the Macau sector. Tesla (TSLA) moved higher after receiving an upgrade from Roth Capital. Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP) sunk on a downgrade from Credit Suisse.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> has been clawing back losses incurred after Friday’s weak jobs report, albeit largely due to weakness in other FX majors. Looking ahead, dollar traders await this week’s CPI and Retail Sales data releases, which will be considered at next week’s FOMC meeting. <strong>MXN</strong> rebounded sharply the US and Mexico agreed upon a deal that averts tariffs on the US’ imports of Mexican goods, USDMXN pressing back toward 19. <strong>CNY</strong> gapped lower over the weekend, as Chinese import data missed expectations, adding to worries about demand weakness in the country. <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> were also dragged lower, erasing last Friday’s post NFP gains. <strong>EUR</strong> was also marginally weaker on the day after “sources” emerged this weekend suggesting the ECB is mulling further easing, but was also weighed down by weak trade data from one of the eurozone’s most important trade partners in China. On which note, SocGen suggests that should this week’s US inflation and retail sales data harden the market’s conviction that the Fed will officially adopt an easing bias, the Yen is more likely to gain than the EUR, whose gains are likely to be capped by a weakening CNY. <strong>GBP</strong> was under pressure from weak April GDP and after Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson kept the prospect of a no deal Brexit alive with some punchy rhetoric. The latest COT data showed that EUR shorts had been pared while specs added to GBP shorts, SocGen notes. <strong>JPY</strong> was softer on the improved market risk tone and after BoJ Governor Kuroda made dovish comments, in which he opened the door for further stimulus as the central bank seeks to meet its 2% inflation target. <strong>CAD</strong> was firm, holding on to post NFP gains below 1.3300 vs. the buck, also supported by strong housing data. <strong>RUB:</strong> ahead of the CBR rate decision this week, RUB was marginally firmer vs. the greenback and hanging around the middle of its 3-month range (63.60 – 65.60). Last week CBR chief Nabiullina hinted again that a rate cut could be considered, as inflation expectations fall. <strong>TRY </strong>advanced on the day, moving back below 5.8000, despite news Russian experts would visit Turkey on June 28th regarding the controversial S-400 missile system which puts Turkey at risk of US sanctions. Looking ahead, CBRT will set policy on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> Some have argued that China’s tolerance for a weaker RMB amid trade wars can be seen in the rise of bearish bets, which has seen the CNY/CNH differential to widen to 200 pips (SocGen notes it is three times the average of 66 pips seen in the last year). Indeed, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that it was no coincidence that the yuan had been wallowed to weaken. Analysts continue to digest PBOC Governor Yi Gang’s recent comments; while some desks have suggested that it is a sign that USDCNY 7.00 could be nearing, UBS highlights the following quotes from the PBOC Governor: (1) “I don’t think along the mathematical scale, any number is more important than other numbers” (which the market has read as the dismissal of the importance of 7.00); (2) “The trade war would have a temporary depreciation pressure on Yuan, but you will see after the noise, RMB will continue to be stable and relatively strong compared to EM currencies”; (3) “PBoC is already pretty much not intervening in the FX market for a long time, and I hope that this situation will continue -- not intervene.” UBS says this all sounds like a reminder that the PBOC is capable and will intervene when required. Overnight, the central bank continued to fix the yuan stronger; “It seems that Beijing still prefers a stable yuan and PBOC is likely to frustrate yuan bears in the short-term,” according to the Swiss bank.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index remains firm amidst broad Dollar gains vs G10 counterparts, but several EMs led by the Mxn are outperforming on a combination of factors – namely the US-Mexican trade agreement. The DXY is trying to test 97.000 again, and just carved out a marginal new 96.934 high for the day having dipped on comments from US President Trump hailing the success of tariffs as a bargaining chip and stressing that if his Chinese peer Xi fails to meet at the G20 then the additional $300 bn goods could be subject to increased levies immediately.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has been the major laggard all day in wake of latest trade data from China showing a worrying fall in imports, with Nzd/Usd slipping further from initial post-NFP peaks towards 0.6600, while the Aud/Usd held up marginally better around 0.6960 and between 1.0532-00 in cross terms awaiting the return of Australia from a long holiday weekend.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound lost ground vs the rebounding Greenback on UK specific bearish impulses as April GDP contracted more than expected, while ip, manufacturing and construction output all missed consensus as well. The ONS said a dramatic decline in the production of motor vehicles and general transport equipment were behind the weakness and due to a combination of planned factory closures plus Brexit uncertainty. Cable lost grip of the 1.2700 handle and Eur/Gbp spiked through 0.8900 to circa 0.8930 before oaring some losses as candidates for the vacant Conservative Party leader post delivered campaign speeches and interviews ahead of the official deadline for declaring their challenge. Meanwhile, the Franc and Yen succumbed to a reversal of safe-haven positioning to trade sub-0.9900 and below 108.50 respectively, with the former also softer for choice against a more resilient single currency that held 1.1200 on the Chf cross and 1.1300 vs the Usd where a decent 1.1 bn option expiry rolled off at the NY cut. Eur/Usd also drew some encouragement from no clean breach of chart support at 1.1293 (Fib and 30 DMA), but equally did not revisit Friday’s post-US jobs data highs (1.1348) or test offers said to be waiting around 1.1350.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie held on to the bulk of its gains made on last week’s contrastingly upbeat Canadian labour report, with Usd/Cad off lows but capped ahead of 1.3300 between 1.3280-25 and building permits soaring to more than offset a modest housing starts miss.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned US-Mexico deal that averts tariffs, and according to Mexican President AMLO should secure the safe passage of the USMCA through Mexico’s Senate (possibly next week) propelled the Peso through 19.1400 at best, while Usd/Zar and even Usd/Try also reversed relatively sharply from recent pinnacles on the wave of risk-on sentiment and despite ongoing concerns about the state of affairs in SA and Turkey.</p>",

Novak also said that the scenario of oil prices of falling to USD 30/bbl is not excluded in the event of no supply cut extension. Russian Deputy Energy Minister Sorokin said that Russia doesn’t want to target an oil price but wants a balanced oil market.

Some of the drop is indeed attributed to the US sanctions on Iranian exports (although analysts note the likelihood of Iran finding methods to continue exporting “off the radar”), but also in the background is the lack of resolve in US-China trade tensions, with fresh tariffs being prepared in the Trump administration’s arsenal ahead of meetings at the G20 summit.</li></ul>",

Finally, iron ore futures are marginally firmer as a firmer Buck caps gains in the base metal, despite China’s <strong>iron ore</strong> imports rebounding from an 18-month-low last month, against the backdrop of tight supply amidst the recent production disruptions including Vale’s shipment cuts and China’s smog alerts.</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak says the scenario of oil prices falling to USD 30/bbl is not excluded in the event of no extension to the global oil deal. </strong>Separately,<strong> Russian Deputy Energy Minister Sorokin </strong>states that we do not target an oil price, we target oil market balance, <strong>Russian intends to return to 100% compliance with the global cut deal in June, and that in general the OPEC+ charter has been agreed </strong>which is to focus on co-operating in general, without any specific numbers.

Elsewhere, amid the possible ramifications of the US-Sino trade war on the global economy, Barclays revised its 2019 oil demand forecast lower by 300K BPD to 1.3mln BPD (in-line with IEA’s 2019 forecast of 1.3mln BPD and marginally higher compared to OPEC’s forecast of around 1.21mln).</p><p>In terms of precious metals, a firmer risk tone and a stronger Greenback have shaved off some gains in gold (-1.0%) and <strong>silver</strong> (-1.5%), whilst <strong>copper</strong> (+0.7%) prices benefit from the risk appetite after Washington struck a deal with Mexico. Finally, <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures are marginally firmer as a firmer Buck caps gains in the base metal, despite China’s iron ore imports rebounding from an 18-month-low last month, against the backdrop of tight supply amidst the recent production disruptions including Vale’s shipment cuts and China’s smog alerts.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback has extended its recovery from Friday’s lows, albeit in part due to renewed weakness in rival currencies and despite outperformance in certain EMs on fundamental and technical factors. The DXY just topped out a fraction below 97.000 having declined to sub-96.500 in wake of a weak BLS report that raised already lofty market expectations for Fed easing, with the focus now switching to upcoming CPI data to add more justification for the FOMC to deliver a cut.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Not the biggest G10 loser, but Sterling has been one of the weakest majors in early EU trade on the back of monthly GDP for April showing a faster than forecast contraction in the UK economy as ip, manufacturing and construction output all slumped more than anticipated. The ONS assigned much of the blame to planned shutdowns and Brexit uncertainty that led to a record decline in car production, while transport equipment tanked the most since 1974. Cable duly retreated through 1.2700 in response and Eur/Gbp breached 0.8900 to post 5 month+ peaks.</p><p>NZD/AUD</p><p>The main victims of a slump in Chinese imports, but somewhat perversely it is the Kiwi that is feeling the brunt of the data that exacerbates US-China trade tensions rather than the Aussie and perhaps due to Australia’s national holiday. Nzd/Usd is hovering just above 0.6600 vs Aud/Usd holding around last Friday’s low and several key technical support levels either side of 0.6950, like 10 and 21 DMA convergence circa 0.6955 and a Fib at 0.6945, while the Aud/Nzd cross is hugging the upper end of a 1.0525-00 range.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The US-Mexican trade accord has seen the Yen and Franc lose safe-haven appeal and retreat vs the Buck to 108.50+ and 0.9900+ respectively, but Usd/Jpy faces some upside hurdles in the form of 1.1 bn option expiries at the 109.00 strike and then trend-line resistance at 109.15, while Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf (latter pivoting 1.1200) will be conscious that Thursday’s SNB quarterly policy review is looming. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd is testing 1.1300 and bids below the big figure after a brief and minor breach of Fib/30 DMA support at 1.1293 amidst more bleak Italian data that was only partly attributed to calendar distortions due to a national holiday, per ISTAT. Note also, decent expiry interest at 1.1300 in 1.1 bn.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie remains relatively bid after Canada’s healthy jobs release in contrast to the US and with some extra encouragement via contagion from the aforementioned US-Mexican agreement that bodes well for USMCA prospects. Usd/Cad off lows but still well under 1.3300 in a 1.3278-25 band and near multi-month lows ahead of Canadian housing starts and building permits.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>As noted above, several regional currencies outpacing the Dollar and none more so than the Peso in relief that Mexico will avoid US tariffs – Usd/Mxn sub-19.2000 and down through 19.1400 at one stage. Meanwhile, the Rand and Lira are also doing well, albeit in corrective moves after hefty losses of late on a steep deceleration in SA GDP/SARB mandate uncertainty, and ongoing US-Turkey strains, as attention turns to the upcoming CBRT policy meeting. Usd/Zar has reversed from 15.0000+ to around 14.8500 and Usd/Try down towards 5.8000, but conversely Usd/Cnh remains close to recent 6.9600+ peaks on the drop in Chinese imports.</p>",

The greenback’s NAFTA counterparts were also underpinned from the agreement with MXN the outperformer after having strengthened by nearly 2%. <strong>EUR/USD</strong> pulled back with ECB policymakers said to be open to lowering rates if growth weakens and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was mired by political uncertainty as the Tory leadership race begins to heat up with front-runner Boris Johnson promising to raise the Higher income tax rate threshold, as well as withhold paying the divorce bill until the EU offers better Brexit terms.

(Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>A disappointing NFP report saw the curve bull-steepen in an immediate response, as traders raised bets that the Fed will cut rates either in response to weakness in some gauges of economic activity, or in an “insurance” manner to extend the recovery. The probability of a June rate cut was up to around 22.5%, July rose to just under 90% (from around 70% on Thursday). Trump’s jawboning efforts resulted in some selling action in the afternoon, however, at settlement, major curve spreads were modestly narrower (2s30s was around 1bps lower, having been at 9bps wides after the payrolls data).

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week mostly higher with sentiment underpinned after US and Mexico reached an agreement to avert tariffs which were set to kick in today, while the region also takes impetus from the last Friday’s gains on Wall St. where disappointing Non-Farm Payrolls data spurred Fed rate cut hopes. Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) is lifted by favourable currency flows and following an upward revision to Q1 GDP, with relevant automakers marginally benefitting from news Fiat and Renault Chairmen discussed reviving their merger plan. Elsewhere, Australia remains closed for holiday, while Hang Seng (+2.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) are positive but with initial weakness seen in the mainland following a net liquidity drain by the PBoC and mixed Chinese Trade data in which Trade Balance and Exports topped estimates although a contraction in Imports highlighted weak domestic demand.</p><p>In FX markets, the breakthrough by US and Mexico to avert tariffs has helped the greenback recoup some of Friday’s losses in which a miss in headline NFP jobs data and weaker than expected earnings growth saw the probabilities of July cut by the Fed increase to just under 90% from around 70% the prior day, while its NAFTA counterparts were also underpinned from the agreement with MXN the outperformer after strengthening by nearly 2%. EUR/USD and GBP/USD have pulled back with the latter mired by political uncertainty as the Tory leadership race heats up and front-runner Boris Johnson promising to raise the Higher income tax rate threshold, as well as withhold paying the divorce bill until the EU offers better Brexit terms. Elsewhere, USD/JPY benefits from the risk appetite and USD-recovery, while antipodeans are softer with AUD/USD back below the 0.7000 handle amid the absence of Australia and following the disappointing Chinese Imports data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially pressured on the safe-haven outflows but then staged an aggressive comeback as the declining yield narrative persists and with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 775bln of JGBs.</p>",
