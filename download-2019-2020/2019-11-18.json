Prior to the report, the risk-on sentiment had been extended from the Friday session, helped by constructive China trade reports over the weekend and the general euphoria of major US equity bourses closing at ATHs. Although havens such as the T-Note, XAU and JPY remained bid through the remainder of the session, the current rally mentality of equity investors failed to let the China news dissuade them, seeing all three mahour US bourses push to ATHs, again. Crude benchmarks failed to revive the bid however, with the pair already on the downside before the risk-off China reports hit the nail in the coffin, settling around a buck lower; mind you reports of Yemen Houthis seizing a Saudi ship in the Red Sea found some support for the complex. Elsewhere, UK polls continued to highlight the increasingly large gap between front-runner Johnson against opposition Labour Leader Corbyn, with cable frontrunning other G10 FX as a result. A bout of EURUSD strength coincided with reports that Trump and Fed Chair Powell had held a conversation on the economy and notedly, negative rates and dollar strength. Meanwhile, the Trump administration extended the Huawei waiver for 90-days, as expected; Senate Majority Leader McConnell also said Trump would sign a stop-gap funding bill to prevent a government shutdown, removing two tail-risk events for the near-future. Participants are now waiting for the official EU auto tariff decision, with reports and expectations suggesting another 6-month delay will be served, allowing the Trump administration and investors to hone their focus on the state of US-China trade.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE</strong>: The mood in Beijing is reportedly pessimistic regarding the possibility of a US-China trade deal being passed, with China troubled after US President Trump said there would be no tariff rollback; reported CNBC’s Yoon citing Government sources. Moreover, the sources told her that China’s strategy is to talk for now and wait for US President Trump to potentially be impeached or the 2020 Presidential election. The negative news, which injected a risk off feel to trade, comes after what was a largely positive weekend of news coverage for the state of US/China negotiations; China's MOFCOM had said USTR Lighthizer and China Vice Premier Liu had held \"constructive discussions\" over the weekend. Desks also continued to cite the interview with NEC director Kudlow on Friday, where he said that the phase one agreement does not necessarily need to be signed-off by Presidents Trump and Xi, with some even suggesting that a ministerial-level sign-off may allow the deal to be wrapped-up sooner, since finding a neutral venue for the event is proving to be tricky<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>* HUAWEI: </strong>The US has extended the license by 90-days again, as it did in August 2019, which allows US companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei. At the end of last week, reports had suggested the extension would be for only two-weeks. While the time extension is more positive than reports had earlier guided, market participants want to see a permanent arrangement, which seems elusive until a phase one deal has been signed between US/China.</p><p><strong>* PBOC Q3 MPR: </strong>The PBOC's Q3 Monetary Policy Report reiterated that authorities would maintain a \"prudent\" stance, while it also cut its 7-day repo rate by 5bps to 2.5%. The PBOC is also expected to lower its LPR rate by the same margin on Wednesday. In terms of the main takeaways of the report, Nomura's analysts note that the central bank appears more cautious on growth headwinds; is handling surging CPI inflation with more caution; on policy, targeted easing underway to stabilise growth; on risk and reform, the central bank continues to pursue financial de-risking, policy bank reform and financial opening; and on the property sector, the PBOC maintains a hawkish stance but with a marginal softening. \"The report increases our conviction in the view that, facing the dilemma of a worsening growth slowdown amid a rapid rise in CPI inflation, worsening growth prospects will likely push Beijing to do more to support growth,\" Nomura said.</p><p><strong>* US POLITICS: </strong>The<strong> </strong>US House is to investigate whether or not US President Trump lied in his written testimony to the US Special Council Mueller in the Russia probe, reported CNN. Elsewhere, US President Trump intimated that he would consider providing a written testimony on the current impeachment probe. On funding the government, US Senate Maj. Leader McConnell stated US President Trump is willing to sign a stop-gap funding bill through December 20th to prevent a partial government shutdown at the end of this week.</p><p><strong>* WTO TRADE INDICATOR: </strong>The WTO's quarterly trade update said growth in global goods trade was expected to remain \"below trend\" in Q4, amid trade tensions and rising tariffs. The trade gauge showed global merchandise trade growth of 0.2% in Q2 (vs +3.5% in Q2 2018). The WTO said \"some components of the barometer have stabilised since the last reading in August, while others remain on a downward trajectory reflecting heightened trade tensions and rising tariffs in key sectors.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Powell met with US President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Monday and discussed the economy, growth, employment and inflation, with Powell's comments consistent with recent remarks. Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming information that bears on the outlook for the economy. US President Trump called the meeting good and cordial, but added that the discussion includes the topics of negative interest rates, dollar strength and its effect on US manufacturing and trade with China, the EU and others. Fed’s Mester (2020 voter, hawk) said that she would have preferred for rates to have remained on hold at the latest FOMC meeting, although said current policy is well calibrated to the economy. The Cleveland Fed President towed the Fed line of a strong consumer and labour market, whilst watching out for signs of sectoral weakness spreading to other segments of the economy. Mester said the FOMC was on pause whilst it watches how the US economy evolves to recent easing. In regard to repo operations, Mester echoed other policymakers saying that there were ongoing discussions about the possibility of a standing repo facility. Fed’s Rosengren (voter and hawkish dissenter) also spoke, reiterating his concerns of financial stability due to easing, where that if the Fed ran out of ammunition there should be additional fiscal policy, he added.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Since the weekend, three ECB policymakers (Muller on the weekend, Vasle and Lane today) have essentially suggested that the central bank has not used up its policy 'ammunition', an argument that had been pushed by market participants in September and October. ECB's Muller on the weekend said that the central bank could broaden its asset purchases if the situation in the Eurozone deteriorates significantly, suggesting that the ECB was not 'out of ammunition'. Muller also added that having very low interest rates 'makes sense'. Moreover, ECB’s Vasle said there is no reason to alter the Eurozone's growth prospects, given that the economy is developing as projected, and the ECB's September measures were working, but if the situation changes, there was room for lower rates. Vasle also argued that recent rise in yields is not worrisome, and financing conditions remain favourable, which reflects the ECB's intentions. ECB's Chief Economist Lane said we are not at some sort of limit in terms of what monetary policy can do. ECB's de Guindos largely stuck to the topic of the European banking sector; he said that the most significant vulnerabilities of euro area banks relate to their weak profitability prospects, and noted that the banking system was operating with significant overcapacity, resulting in cost inefficiencies and competitive pressures. He added that weaker cyclical momentum and associated low interest rates were weighing on bank profitability, although monetary policy accommodation has supported lending volumes. Finally, ECB’s de Cos stated that it is 'absolutely essential' that Europe moves towards agreeing on a common deposit insurance scheme in order to complete banking union, an argument made by German Finance Minister Scholz, although the Italian Finance Ministers and German Government have been against/dismissive of these ideas. On rates, de Cos said that in many countries interest rates are expected to stay at low levels for longer.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION: </strong>UK PM Johnson on the weekend wrote that all 635 Conservative candidates standing in the December elections have pledged that, if elected, they will vote to pass his Brexit deal in parliament. Also on the weekend, a YouGov poll showed the Tory lead over Labour extending to 17 points, the widest margin of any poll since Parliament dissolved and the official campaigning period began (the polls since&nbsp; the end of last week now see the Conservatives ahead by a margin between 8-17 ppts vs 8-13 points when campaigning began). Meanwhile, on Monday, UK PM Johnson said that if the Tories won the election, it would postpone further cuts in corporation tax; this followed from (and was in contrast to) earlier reports that stated UK PM Johnson was to pledge tax cuts for businesses in attempt to ease Brexit related concerns.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> As had been hinted at in recent days, the US and South Korea on Sunday said upcoming military drills would be postponed in an effort to invigorate peace talks with <strong>North Korea</strong>; Washington denied that this amounted to a further concession to Pyongyang. Following the announcement, President Trump tweeted to North Korea's Kim to \"act quickly\" and \"get the deal done\", also hinting at a further meeting by signing-off \"see you soon!\". However, North Korea reportedly proceeded with air drills despite efforts by US and South Korea to reduce tensions and said it is not interested in a \"fruitless\" summit with the US. Over in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, unrest continued to intensify into the Weekend, with Police reportedly threatening to use live ammunition if protestors continue their use of weapons, while a commentary in the People's Daily said there was no room to compromise with protestors. Later, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK said that if the Hong Kong situation was to become 'uncontrollable' then the Central Government would not sit-by and watch. The US condemned the “unjustified” use of force in Hong Kong, said the White House. US Secretary of State Pompeo reiterated the US is deeply concerned about the Hong Kong protests, although he called on Carrie Lam to allow an independent probe into the protest incidents. Over in the Middle East; <strong>Iran</strong>'s stock of 'heavy water' has reportedly surpassed the 130-tonne limit which was set by their deal with major powers, according to reports citing the UN Nuclear Watchdog, another example of the country moving away from international agreements that limit its nuclear activity. Finally, a Saudi-led coalition reported that <strong>Yemen's Houthi's</strong> have hijacked a vessel which was towing a South Korean drilling rig south of the Red Sea.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 0.69 LOWER 57.14/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.86 LOWER AT USD 62.44/BBL. </strong>Crude markets were under pressure during Monday trade, with concerns over reported Chinese pessimism re. the prospect of a deal with the US weighing on macro sentiment. Front month WTI and Brent contracts fell to USD 56.60/bbl and just below USD 62.00/bbl, respectively, from earlier highs of USD 58.10/bbl and USD 63.60/bbl, before stabilising as market pertinent news flow subsided, although reports of Yemen’s Houthis seizing three ships, one of which being Saudi owned, coincided with a late session rally, albeit only marginal. However, the selling pressure began ahead of the negative trade related headlines, coinciding with (as has been the case frequently of late) the arrival of US traders to their desks. Crude specific news flow did little to change the dial; Russian oil output in first week of November was 11.25mln BPD (vs. 11.24mln BPD in September), according to IFAX citing sources. Meanwhile, Saudi crude exports fell to 6.67mln BPD in September, a 0.21mln BPD fall, according to JODI.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-10+. </strong>Treasuries settled modestly higher on Monday, reversing losses from the Asian and European session after negative reports of the state of US-China trade relations hit wires. Although, equity bourses managed to reverse most of their losses, the T-Note remained close to its highs through till settlement. The 10-year yield moved over 2.5bps lower, getting closer to the 1.8% level, whilst the 2-year yield fell by under 2bps, with the less pronounced front-end move reflective of the haven bid on trade concerns, rather than altering expectations of US monetary policy.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 3122, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 8328, Dow Jones 0.1% at 28036</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.3%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy -1.3%, Financials 0.2%, Health Care -0.4%, Industrials -0.3%, Information Technology 0.3%, Materials -0.2%, Telecommunication Services 0.3%, Utilities 0.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Coty (COTY) traded higher after Kylie Jenner took a 51% stake in the co. for USD 600mln, weighing on Ulta Beauty (ULTA). United Health (UNH) continued its rally after President Trump announced price transparency laws from Friday, where it will allow the US to purchase drugs internationally. Democratic Presidential Candidate Warren also announced her healthcare plan over the weekend, which appears to be a slightly scaled-down version of her initial plan. AMD (AMD) traded higher to start the week as the US confirmed pre-market source reports that the US will grant US companies a 3-month extension on Huawei waivers. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied on a PT upgrade at Citi. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) initially traded lower on a report by WSJ which stated it rushed the testing of its baby powder which found no Asbestos following a product recall, however the name ended the session relatively flat. A similar move in T-Mobile (TMUS) who opened lower on the news that its CEO John Legere is to leave and is to be replaced by COO Mike Sievert on May 1st, the day after Legere's contract ends on April 30th. Abiomed (ABMD) fell almost 20% on reports of two clinical sturdies which questioned the usefulness of its heart pumps.</p><p>* <strong>M&amp;A:</strong> HP (HPQ) were hit after it announced its board unanimously rejected the takeover offer from Xerox (XRX). Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) announced the US FTC accepted the proposed merger with Celgene Corp. (CELG), however on the condition it must divest Celgene’s psoriasis drug, Otezla. United Bankshares (UBSI) and Carolina Financial (CARO) announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement, with the combined company worth roughly USD 25bln in assets, and will rank in the top 35 largest US banks in terms of market cap. The aggregate transaction value will be USD 1.1bln, with both boards unanimously approving the decision. Callon Petroleum (CPE) and Carrizo Oil &amp; Gas (CRZO) were hit as CPE’s fund manager Paulson &amp; Co. is no longer is against the proposed acquisition CRZO and will now vote its shares in favour of the transaction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>GBP</strong> an outperforming currency to start the week as UK PM Johnson’s market preferred Conservative Party extending their lead over the opposition Labour Party to as much as 17 points (the most since Johnson became PM) acting as a tailwind. Also, helping the Pound, Johnson announced that if elected, all the Tory candidates have pledged to back his deal. From a technical perspective, analysts at SocGen are keeping a close eye on EURGBP 50-month moving averages (around 0.8560), urging not to underestimate its significance; \"only four declines below this level have occurred since 1997,\" the bank writes, \"flows may be credited for the bid in sterling but the sense of optimism that PM Johnson is cruising towards an absolute majority on 12 December is compelling investors to position tactically for a recovery in GBP.\" Elsewhere, major FX largely took its cue from the negative update on the US/China trade front (China pessimistic on chances of deal, strategy is to wait for impeachment/election); havens <strong>JPY, CHF</strong> and <strong>XAU </strong>subsequently caught a bid, with the former falling as low as 108.52 from above 109.00 and the latter cruising back above USD 1470/oz. Flows into havens weakened the <strong>buck</strong>, with further downside seen amid comments from US President Trump that he had brought up the topics of negative rates and dollar strength in his meeting with Fed Chair Powell – although no move was seen in rates. Buck weakness resulted in <strong>EUR</strong> strength, EURUSD peaked at 1.1090 from lows of 1.1050. <strong>CAD</strong> headed into trade marginally stronger against the buck despite falling oil prices as the cross largely took its que from USD weakness ahead of Wednesday’s CPI and Friday’s retail sales. <strong>Antipodes</strong> were mixed with AUD heading into Asia-Pac trade slightly weaker on negative trade headlines and NZD marginally stronger, although the initial AUD &amp; NZD losses were pared back amid a weaker buck.</p>",

However, the selling pressure began ahead of the negative trade related headlines, coinciding with (as has been the case frequently of late) the arrival of US traders to their desks. Crude specific news flow did little to change the dial; Russian oil output in first week of November was 11.25mln BPD (vs. 11.24mln BPD in September), according to IFAX citing sources. Meanwhile, Saudi crude exports fell to 6.67mln BPD in September, a 0.21mln BPD fall, according to JODI.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The Dollar Index is poised to end the first EU session of the week relatively unchanged intra-day and towards the middle of today’s 97.87-96 range. The broad USD and Index was little swayed on reports via CNBC’s Yoon highlighting the pessimism in China regarding a trade deal amid ill sentiment after US disagreed to rollback tariffs. Despite the Dollar’s resilience to the news, USD/CNH saw renewed upside and printed fresh session highs at 7.0320 (vs. 7.0061) before stabilising just off highs with its 100 DMA at 7.0382.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, XAU, AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>All moving accordingly and in-fitting with the risk aversion. USD/JPY fell to fresh session lows of 108.63 ahead of the US cash open and back below its 200 DMA (109.00) after having eclipsed the round figure (and almost tested its 50 WMA at 109.10) earlier in the European session. Similarly, safe-haven inflow saw spot gold nurse earlier losses and extend gains to 1470+/oz vs. an intraday trough at 1456.65/oz with eyes now on its 100 DMA at 1480/oz. Meanwhile, high-beta FX remain subdued after taking a hit on the US-Sino source piece with AUD/USD back below its 50 DMA (0.6815) having briefly dipped south of the 0.6800 mark before drifting off lows. Its Kiwi counterpart gave up the 0.6400 handle in wake of the report but remains slightly more resilient amid last week’s surprise hold by the RBNZ. The Loonie also saw downside but also on the back of falling energy prices albeit has since drifted off lows with USD/CAD relatively stable after having hit an intraday peak at 1.3235 vs. a low of 1.3210 which coincides with its 50 DMA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Both poised to end the EU session in the green, more-so the Sterling as it still stands as the G10 outperformer amid tailwinds from weekend polls suggesting an uptrend in the Conservative’s lead over Labour, with the weekend polls showing a lead between 14-17 points across three surveys. Cable has nudged up the top end of its intraday band to 1.2985 (vs. low 1.2900) ahead of touted barriers at 1.3000. Thus EUR/GBP looks to end EU trade on the backfoot having touched base at 0.8520 vs. high of 0.8566 with bears’ targets including the psychological 0.8500-mark, YTD low at 0.8456 ahead of the 55 MMA (0.8437). Meanwhile, the Single Currency saw little action and largely moves at the whim of the Buck having clocked in a 20 pip intraday range between 1.1050-70 with little move from ECB speakers with the most notable comments from Vasle who noted that there is room for lower rates if the EZ situation worsens.</p>",

(+0.6%)</strong> was initially choppy with markets somewhat desensitized by the latest trade headlines including reports of a constructive call between US-China top trade negotiators and recent comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross that the finish line is close regarding a phase one trade deal. However, Chinese stocks were eventually supported after the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos for the first time in 3 weeks and lowered the rate by 5bps to 2.50%, while the <strong>Hang Seng (+1.4%)</strong> was resilient despite continued Hong Kong unrest with the index lifted by outperformance in property names and on touted short-covering following last week’s 5% slump, as well as reports of government rescue for mid-sized lender Harbin Bank.

(Yonhap)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Major European bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%) are choppy and mostly directionless thus far on the first trading session of the week, following a mostly positive APAC session where sentiment was supported by Wall Street’s Friday rally, seemingly positive US/China trade headlines and the latest cut to the PBoC’s 7-Day Reverse Repo rate. European bourses trade mostly within last week’s ranges, however, US indices futures made fresh ATHs again this morning, with ES Dec’ 19 futures reaching as high as 3127.50. Looking ahead, further impetus is most likely to come from further developments on the US/China trade front, with the data docket largely empty for the day, aside from Central Bank speak. Moving on to the sectors, the picture is mixed; Utilities (+0.1%), Financials (+0.3%) and Health Care (+0.6%) are on the front foot, while Tech (-0.3%) and Industrials (-0.3%) the slight laggards. In terms of the most notable individual movers; BME (+38.1%) shot higher on increased hopes for a bidding war between Euronext (+1.2%) and SIX Exchange, the former having confirmed it is in discussions for the Co. and the latter putting in a bid worth EUR 34.0/shr. Meanwhile, Qiagen (+12.1%) opened higher on the news that the Co. has received several conditional non-binding indications of interest and has decided to start discussions to examine potential strategic alternatives. In terms of the laggards, Aviva (-3.5%) shares were sent tumbling on the news that, after an options review for its Singapore business, the Co. had concluded that retaining the business will achieve the best shareholder value.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong> - Another subdued day for the broad Dollar and Index with the latter losing further ground below the 98.00 figure amid Friday’s downbeat US IP figure coupled with strength in some G10 peers. DXY probes the 97.90 mark having dipped to 97.87 as European participants entered the market with the next level to the downside its 21 DMA at 97.83. Meanwhile, the Yuan is on a modestly softer footing after the PBoC cut its 7-day reverse repo rate by 5bps ahead of the Central Bank’s LPR decision later this week - with consensus pointing towards a maintained rate, but against growing views of a 5bps reduction. USD/CNH remains off highs after the pair rose to to almost 7.0200 post-PBoC ahead of its 100 DMA at 7.0381. Looking ahead, this week sees a mammoth USD 5bln in USD/CNH at strike 7.0000, with the largest chunk of USD 2.1bln for tomorrow.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR -</strong> Sterling stands as the marked outperformer thus far amid tailwinds from weekend polls suggesting an uptrend in the Conservative’s lead over Labour, with the weekend polls showing a lead between 14-17 points across three surveys. Thus, Cable extends upside above 1.2900 to test 1.2950 in early EU trade before taking out resistance at 1.2972-5 (Oct31/Nov1 highs) and ahead of touted barriers at 1.3000. As a result, EUR/GBP continues to edge lower towards the 0.8500 mark (0.8535 intraday low) with bears’ targets now including the YTD low at 0.8456 ahead of the 55 MMA (0.8437). Meanwhile, the Single Currency sees little action and largely moves at the whim of the Buck having clocked in a 20 pip intraday parameter for now and with a few pertinent speakers on today’s docket and a lack of notable data points. EUR/USD meanders just above 1.1050 and with options expiries eyeing a hefty EUR 1.3bln at 1.1055 for today’s NY cut.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> Modestly softer start to the week with little by way of major weekend risk events to sway sentiment. USD/JPY tested 109.00 in early trade and has since meandered around the round figure where its 200 DMA also resides. Scheduled events today are unlikely to affect the market mood, but as always traders will be on the lookout for developments on the trade and Hong Kong front for catalysts.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.1035 (300M),<strong> 1.1055 (1.3BLN), </strong>1.1145 (760M)</p><p>- USD/JPY: 108.00 (500M), 109.00 (500M), 109.35-40 (500M)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A relatively quiet start to the week for markets in general, with the debt complex little different. <strong>Bunds</strong> are slightly subdued but overall rangebound within a circa 35 tick band for the day thus far on a lack of fresh catalysts and as the day’s calendar provides little in the way of inspiration aside from ECB speak later in the session. To the downside a break below the day’s aforementioned band would bring support at 170.26 in to play; in contrast, any support for the German 10-year would, aside from the psychological 171.0 mark, highlight 171.15 as a resistance point. Elsewhere, <strong>gilts</strong> are the marginally underperformer this morning on the weekend’s Tory election poll gains and reports that all contesting Conservatives will back PM Johnsons Brexit plan; on a technical note, the sessions current low of 131.40 resides just above support at 131.36. Looking ahead, and across the pond, the afternoon’s slate does see the NAHB housing index and, more pertinently, comments from Fed’s Mester who is a 2020 voter. <strong>USTs</strong> are slightly subdued in sympathy with their European counterparts though price action is minimal with the curve unchanged at present.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Crude prices are flat to lower</strong>, as the market consolidates following last Friday’s healthy gains on the back of trade related optimism tailwinds. Both WTI and Brent front month contracts trade at the top of recent ranges, the former just below the USD 58.00/bbl mark and the latter comfortably above USD 63.00/bbl. Other geopolitical developments are focused over in East Asia; the US and South Korea postponed joint military drills to help provide an opportunity to bring North Korea back to negotiations, while US Defence Secretary Esper reportedly met with Chinese Defence Minister Wei in Bangkok which experts described as significant in strengthening mutual military trust and China was said to ask US to stop escalating the South China Sea situation. In terms of metals; <strong>Gold</strong> has been heading lower, breaking below resistance just above the USD 1460/oz level. <strong>Copper</strong>, meanwhile, has been moving sideways after making modest gains overnight on the back of PBoC liquidity injections at a lower RRR and trade hopes</p><p><strong>Iran experienced widespread protests in more than 100 cities and towns following a 50% gas price increase;</strong> separately, protestors are reportedly blocking the entrance to Iraq’s Umm Qasr port, operations are down by 50%., according to port sources.

In terms of the laggards, Aviva (-3.5%) shares were sent tumbling on the news that, after an options review for its Singapore business, the Co. had concluded that retaining the business will achieve the best shareholder value.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>DXY, Yuan - Another subdued day for the broad Dollar and Index with the latter losing further ground below the 98.00 figure amid Friday’s downbeat US IP figure coupled with strength in some G10 peers. DXY probes the 97.90 mark having dipped to 97.87 as European participants entered the market with the next level to the downside its 21 DMA at 97.83. Meanwhile, the Yuan is on a modestly softer footing after the PBoC cut its 7-day reverse repo rate by 5bps ahead of the Central Bank’s LPR decision later this week - with consensus pointing towards a maintained rate, but against growing views of a 5bps reduction. USD/CNH remains off highs after the pair rose to to almost 7.0200 post-PBoC ahead of its 100 DMA at 7.0381. Looking ahead, this week sees a mammoth USD 5bln in USD/CNH at strike 7.0000, with the largest chunk of USD 2.1bln for tomorrow.</p><p>GBP, EUR - Sterling stands as the marked outperformer thus far amid tailwinds from weekend polls suggesting an uptrend in the Conservative’s lead over Labour, with the weekend polls showing a lead between 14-17 points across three surveys. Thus, Cable extends upside above 1.2900 to test 1.2950 in early EU trade before taking out resistance at 1.2972-5 (Oct31/Nov1 highs) and ahead of touted barriers at 1.3000. As a result, EUR/GBP continues to edge lower towards the 0.8500 mark (0.8535 intraday low) with bears’ targets now including the YTD low at 0.8456 ahead of the 55 MMA (0.8437). Meanwhile, the Single Currency sees little action and largely moves at the whim of the Buck having clocked in a 20 pip intraday parameter for now and with a few pertinent speakers on today’s docket and a lack of notable data points. EUR/USD meanders just above 1.1050 and with options expiries eyeing a hefty EUR 1.3bln at 1.1055 for today’s NY cut.</p><p>JPY - Modestly softer start to the week with little by way of major weekend risk events to sway sentiment. USD/JPY tested 109.00 in early trade and has since meandered around the round figure where its 200 DMA also resides. Scheduled events today are unlikely to affect the market mood, but as always traders will be on the lookout for developments on the trade and Hong Kong front for catalysts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A relatively quiet start to the week for markets in general, with the debt complex little different. Bunds are slightly subdued but overall rangebound within a circa 35 tick band for the day thus far on a lack of fresh catalysts and as the day’s calendar provides little in the way of inspiration aside from ECB speak later in the session. To the downside a break below the day’s aforementioned band would bring support at 170.26 in to play; in contrast, any support for the German 10-year would, aside from the psychological 171.0 mark, highlight 171.15 as a resistance point. Elsewhere, gilts are the marginally underperformer this morning on the weekend’s Tory election poll gains and reports that all contesting Conservatives will back PM Johnsons Brexit plan; on a technical note, the sessions current low of 131.40 resides just above support at 131.36. Looking ahead, and across the pond, the afternoon’s slate does see the NAHB housing index and, more pertinently, comments from Fed’s Mester who is a 2020 voter. USTs are slightly subdued in sympathy with their European counterparts though price action is minimal with the curve unchanged at present.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude prices are flat to lower, as the market consolidates following last Friday’s healthy gains on the back of trade related optimism tailwinds. Both WTI and Brent front month contracts trade at the top of recent ranges, the former just below the USD 58.00/bbl mark and the latter comfortably above USD 63.00/bbl. Other geopolitical developments are focused over in East Asia; the US and South Korea postponed joint military drills to help provide an opportunity to bring North Korea back to negotiations, while US Defence Secretary Esper reportedly met with Chinese Defence Minister Wei in Bangkok which experts described as significant in strengthening mutual military trust and China was said to ask US to stop escalating the South China Sea situation. In terms of metals; Gold has been heading lower, breaking below resistance just above the USD 1460/oz level. Copper, meanwhile, has been moving sideways after making modest gains overnight on the back of PBoC liquidity injections at a lower RRR and trade hopes</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with the region only partially sustaining the momentum from last Friday’s record-setting performance on Wall St. where all major indices notched all-time highs and the DJIA breached the 28000 milestone for the first time. Furthermore, the region also digests a cut in the PBoC’s Reverse Repo rate but with gains limited as participants await the next developments on the trade front. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are mixed with Australia dragged by broad weakness across its sectors including underperformance in gold miners and losses for top-weighted financials, while the Japanese benchmark is relatively quiet with mild gains spurred on the back of a weaker currency. Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) was initially indecisive with markets somewhat desensitized by the latest trade headlines including reports of a constructive call between US-China top trade negotiators and recent comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross that the finish line is close regarding a phase one trade deal. However, the mainland was gradually supported after the PBoC injected liquidity through 7-day reverse repos for the first time in 3 weeks and lowered the rate by 5bps to 2.50%, while the Hang Seng (+1.1%) is resilient despite continued unrest with the index lifted by outperformance in property names and on touted short-covering/bargain hunting following last week’s 5% slump.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly subdued and has trickled below the 98.00 level after the recent mixed data from US including a much wider than expected contraction in US Industrial Production and miss in Retail Sales Ex-Auto. Pressure in the greenback id also a function of the upside in its European counterparts as EUR/USD prods above 1.1050 and with GBP/USD gaining a firmer footing on the 1.2900 handle after the latest Survation election polls suggested an expanding Tory gap against Labour which more than doubled to 14 points from a prior 6-point lead. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses hold on to Friday’s gains which were spurred by the record highs on Wall St, while antipodeans trade sideways on the mixed risk tone, lack of pertinent data and with CNY indecisive as a firmer PBoC reference rate is counterbalanced by a reduction in the 7-day repo rate for the first time since 2015.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are choppy with prices rangebound amid the somewhat mixed risk sentiment and with participants sidelined ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction.</p>",
