JP Morgan traded ~2% which led to outperformance in the DJ given the banks 3.2% weighting. JPM beat on EPS, revenue, NII and held a strong FICC revenue. Citi (C) also performed well trading with gains just shy of 3% after beats in EPS, Revenue, FICC revenue and investment banking revenue, while WFC noted the EPS includes an impact of litigation accruals of a loss of USD 0.33/shr, although even on an adjusted basis it would still miss analyst expectations. Elsewhere, Amazon (AMZN) reportedly lifted its ban on FedEx (FDX) Ground for third party prime shipments, according to WSJ. Visa (V) acquired Plaid, a fin-tech start up, for USD 5.3bln.

By settlement, 2s10s was 2bps narrower at 24bps, with the 10-year yield falling more than 3bps, the most pronounced on the curve. US T-note futures (H0) settled 7 ticks higher at 129-04+.</p>",

Earlier, Politico reported that the Phase 1 deal (to be signed Wednesday at 11:30 EST / 16:30 GMT) will include a pledge by China to buy USD 200bln of US goods over a 2-year period: USD 50bln in energy, USD 40bln in agriculture, USD 35bln-40bln in services and USD 75bln in manufactured goods. The hard figures will serve as a relief to some participants, who have been concerned the deal would contain no hard numbers regarding purchases; however, SCMP reported, citing ex-US trade officials, that doubts remain on whether the full US-China Phase One agreement text will be released, where high-ranking Trump administration officials insist the details will be made available, but there are signs that the full texts and numbers will not be publicly disclosed – USTR Lighthizer has said previously that some parts of the deal, such as China’s commodity purchases, will not be published. The China Global Times Editor later noted that to his knowledge, \"China did make a commitment to expand imports from the US\", adding \"It will be more of a test for the US whether it can provide enough products that Chinese market welcomes.” Meanwhile, as was previously reported, the US Treasury officially removed China from the currency manipulator list in its semi-annual report and said China made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation in the Phase 1 deal, but also noted that China needs to take necessary steps to avoid a persistently weak currency. Subsequently, China's Foreign Ministry stated that China will keep their currency basically stable.</p><p><strong>* US CPI (DEC): </strong>Rose by 0.2% M/M, missing the expected +0.3%, which was also the same pace as the prior, while the core figure rose by 0.1%, also less than the expected +0.2%, which was also the prior pace. However, both the headline and core Y/Y printed 2.3%, as expected, with the headline up from the prior 2.1% and the core unchanged. Pantheon describes the release as “ignorable” and unlikely to mark the start of a sustained shift, noting the core being weighed on by the volatile auto component, airline fares, household operations and lodging costs, whilst the headline was supported more by the firmer energy prices in the month, as was widely expected going into the release. The consultancy concludes that core inflation is stable, but will likely experience some upside bias in H1 this year due to adverse base effects, namely, “medical care, rent, and perhaps modest tariff pass-through in some components where tariffed Chinese imports have large market shares.” With inflation stable and muted, the Fed has little reason to consider a change in interest rates, as market pricing echoes.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE DATA (NOV):</strong> Chinese November trade metrics are, on the surface at least, strong figures with the overall trade balance (USD-denominated) at 46.79bln vs. prev. 37.93bln, but below the exp. 48.0bln. In terms of exports, this was at 9.0% vs. exp. 2.8% (prev. 1.3%), CapEco note that this data illustrates that the outlook for exports is beginning to improve; albeit, China’s customs noted that trade with the US in 2019 did drop by 10.7% YY – as such, CapEco suggests that the US tariffs remain a drag. In terms of imports, this came in at 16.3% vs. exp. 9.6%; however, the consultancy posits this increase as being almost exclusively attributed to base effects – as such, “it is premature to conclude there has been a marked pick-up in demand.”</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Libya's Haftar left talks for the ceasefire without signing a deal, which led Turkey to respond by noting if attacks were to continue, they would not be afraid of \"teaching them a lesson\". Although later reports suggested that Haftar has agreed to further talks, but it is unclear when these will go ahead. In Iraq, there were further reports of an attack on the Taji base, north of Baghdad which sometimes homes US troops, however there were reportedly no casualties.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s George</strong> (non-voter, hawk) towed the Fed’s line that rates on hold for now is appropriate in her view as the bank assess the economy’s response to the previous rate cuts and the incoming data. George continues to forecast strong consumer spending, continued weakness in manufacturing and business investment this year. On growth, expects GDP growth to slow to its long growth trend of 1.75-2% (Median long-term view stands at 1.9%).</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO: </strong>Cut its 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 80k BPD to 1.34mln BPD, whilst initiating 2021 world oil demand growth forecast at 1.38mln BPD. 2020 US crude output is to rise 1.06mln BPD to 13.30mln BPD (prev. rise of 913k BPD to 13.18mln BPD), whilst 2021 output is to rise 410k BPD to 13.71mln BPD (initial forecast).</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLED USD 0.15 HIGHER AT USD 58.23/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.29 HIGHER AT USD 64.49/BBL: </strong>Energy markets reversed Monday’s losses amid stronger Chinese import data, Libyan geopolitical risk, OPEC+ meeting delays and book squaring ahead of US energy inventory data. The oil benchmarks found support in the earlier European session, alongside an equity rally, finding their peak as US participants came to their desks; WTI (G0) and Brent (H0) printed highs of 58.72 and 65.04, respectively. Elsewhere supporting the bid was reports that Libya’s General Haftar refused to sign an unconditional ceasefire agreement. Furthermore, according to Tass citing sources, OPEC+ is mulling the delay of its March meeting to June, which if so, would see its output cuts extended till then too; the news saw some price strength in the latter part of the session, although the less bullish EIA STEO likely stopped the oil futures setting new highs. However, the late announcement of the US delaying further tariff rollback until after the election helped prices pare back into settlement. Elsewhere, an element of book squaring was likely contributing to price action ahead of the US energy inventories, with the private data report due after the close on Tuesday ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday. Current inventory expectations (bbls) see crude stocks -0.5mln, distillates +1.2mln, Gasoline +3.4mln.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.15% at 3,283, NDX -0.41% at 9,033, DJI +0.11% at 28,939.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS:</strong> Materials -0.40%, IT -0.60%, Communication -0.30%, Industrials -0.01%, Financials -0.26%, Staples +0.02%, Utilities +0.27%, Discretionary -0.12%, Energy 0%, Health Care +0.55%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Earnings season kicked off today with earnings from JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi (C). JP Morgan traded ~2% which led to outperformance in the DJ given the banks 3.2% weighting. JPM beat on EPS, revenue, NII and held a strong FICC revenue. Its equity markets revenue rose 15% Y/Y to USD .5bln due to higher revenue in prime and cash equities. JPM noted quarterly markets businesses rebounded from a challenging previous year, with resolution of some trade issues supported client activity towards year-end. It also highlighted its quarterly investment banking revenue growth driven by higher debt and equity underwriting fees which was partially offset by lower advisory fees. Citi (C) also performed well trading with gains just shy of 3% after beats in EPS, Revenue, FICC revenue and investment banking revenue. However, its equity market revenue fell 23% to USD 516mln and the bank announced its results included a USD 0.25/shr benefit from tax matters, although even without the benefit it still beat estimates. Wells Fargo (WFC) however capped gains in the financial sector after falling 4%, following a miss on EPS, revenue, NII and NIM, whilst ROE declined from its previous. WFC noted the EPS includes an impact of litgation accruals of a loss of USD 0.33/shr, although even on an adjusted basis it would still miss analyst expectations. Delta Airlines (DAL) traded 4% higher amid its earnings report which beat on top and bottom line estimates and highlighted that it is picking up new customers as its rivals are facing the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX woes; DAL do not fly the 737 MAX. Boston Scientific (BSX) reported preliminary sales which slightly missed estimates, and it also announced FY19 Adj. EPS will be within its previously issued guidance which saw BSX fall over 10%. Gamestop (GME) reported dismal holiday sales, which resulted in a forecast cut for FY19 SSS which sent the stock 10% lower. <i>For all the figures click here: </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/jpmorgan-chase-co-jpm-q4-19-usd-eps-2-57-exp-2-30-adj-revenue-29-21bln-exp-27-96bln-14-01-2020\"><i>JPM</i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/citigroup-inc-c-q4-19-usd-eps-2-15-adj-1-90-exp-1-87-revenue-18-38bln-exp-17-89bln-14-01-2020\"><i>C</i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/wells-fargo-co-wfc-q4-19-usd-eps-0-60-exp-1-10-eps-includes-impact-of-litigation-accruals-of-loss-of-usd-0-33-shr-revenue-19-9bln-exp-20-1bln-14-01-2020\"><i>WFC</i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/delta-air-lines-inc-dal-q4-19-usd-adj-eps-1-70-exp-1-38-revenue-11-44bln-exp-11-35bln-14-01-2020\"><i>DAL</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Amazon (AMZN) reportedly lifted its ban on FedEx (FDX) Ground for third party prime shipments, according to WSJ. Visa (V) acquired Plaid, a fin-tech start up, for USD 5.3bln. WSJ reported previously that in its 2018 funding round it was valued at USD 2.65bln. Apple (AAPL) saw a positive note from Wedbush and UBS with PT upgrades to USD 400 and USD 355, respectively. MGM (MGM) is reportedly near a deal to sell MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay resorts and casinos in Las Vegas to a JV which includes Blackstone (BX), according to WSJ citing people familiar with the matter, which could fetch up to USD 4.5bln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-04+. </strong>The<strong> </strong>Treasury curve bull-flattened on Tuesday amid lacklustre US CPI and China trade disappointment. The bids occurred not long after Bunds started trading, and then the T-Note extended the move after the M/M US CPI figures came in a tad weak, with rates falling even further on a risk-off move following reports the US would not be considering further tariff removals for China until after the US election. By settlement, 2s10s was 2bps narrower at 24bps, with the 10-year yield falling more than 3bps, the most pronounced on the curve.</p><p><strong>* REPO: </strong>The NY Fed announced its month-ahead repo operation schedule where it will continue its overnight operations of at least USD 120bln (unchanged) as well as a series of term repo-operations until Thursday 13th February, whilst maintaining its US T-Bill purchases at a clip of USD 60bln a month. The term operations will be at the 14-day maturity and conducted every Tuesday and Thursday at USD 35bln, until February where it will be cut to USD 30bln, seemingly once the month-end funding pressures subside. Overall, the NY Fed hasn’t made any substantial steps towards a marked reduction in the liquidity it will provide. Some desks had anticipated a cut in both the overnight and term operations, although this has not materialised for the month ahead.</p><p>*<strong> FX: USD</strong> traded within the 97.32-57 parameters with a turnaround from highs post CPI with some slight downside seen after reports US are to keep tariffs on China until after the election. <strong>EUR </strong>remained above 1.11, likely supported by heavy option expiries on the figure. <strong>CHF </strong>strengthened against the Euro after the US put Switzerland on its currency manipulator list, with desks noting the move brings the “cat out the bag” in that now attention has been drawn to it, the SNB will be less likely to thwart its strength. <strong>GBP</strong> retraced some of the post-dovish BoE rhetoric and regained 1.30 to the upside, reportedly breaking through some heavy offers. <strong>CAD</strong> rather uneventful around the 1.3050 mark. <strong>JPY</strong> flat against the buck although caught support after reports suggest US is to keep tariffs on China until after the election. <strong>CNH</strong> lost ground following the reports. <strong>XAU</strong> remains shy of the 1550 handle, although tested the key figure after the latest US/China update. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed with <strong>ZAR</strong> and <strong>MXN</strong> trading flat against the buck, TRY lost further ground amid a breakdown of Libya peace talks. <strong>BRL</strong> firmer after the government raised its 2020 economic growth and inflation forecasts.</p>",

The oil benchmarks found support in the earlier European session, alongside an equity rally, finding their peak as US participants came to their desks; WTI (G0) and Brent (H0) printed highs of 58.72 and 65.04, respectively. Elsewhere supporting the bid was reports that Libya’s General Haftar refused to sign an unconditional ceasefire agreement. Furthermore, according to Tass citing sources, OPEC+ is mulling the delay of its March meeting to June, which if so, would see its output cuts extended till then too; the news saw some price strength in the latter part of the session, although the less bullish EIA STEO likely stopped the oil futures setting new highs. Also, the late announcement of the US delaying further tariff rollback until after the election helped prices continue to pare back into settlement. Elsewhere, an element of book squaring was likely contributing to price action ahead of the US energy inventories, with the private data report due after the close on Tuesday ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday. Current inventory expectations (bbls) see crude stocks -0.5mln, distillates +1.2mln, Gasoline +3.4mln.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index looks a bit more robust around the 97.500 level, albeit with the Greenback ending Tuesday’s EU session relatively mixed vs major currency counterparts following broadly in line with consensus headline and core CPI data. However, US Treasury yields are softening again and the curve re-flattening amidst an overall stall in risk-on sentiment awaiting Wednesday’s Phase 1 trade deal signing at the White House.</p><p><strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major outlier and outperformer after Switzerland was labelled as an FX manipulator by the US and the Franc rallied on the premise that the SNB may refrain from intervening to keep demand for the safe-haven in check or at least observe a bit more tolerance before stepping in to curb strength. Usd/Chf extended declines through 0.9700 and Eur/Chf tested lows not seen since May 2019 just ahead of light bids said to be sitting at 1.0750 before both pairs based in wake of reactions from the Swiss Government and Central Bank – former claiming no immediate consequences from being included on the list and latter insisting that direct action is completely driven by monetary policy not a desire to gain a competitive edge via devaluation.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/JPY/EUR/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All ending narrowly mixed against the Buck, but not before some volatile moves and choppy price action. Cable traded as low as 1.2955 after losing grip of the 1.3000 handle before the Pound recouped almost all its losses and Eur/Gbp pulled back from a test of 0.8600 to just shy of 0.8550. Similarly, the Aussie seemed destined to relinquish 0.6900+ status and lose sight of the round number altogether, but bounced into the NY cut where 1.3 bn expiries between 0.6900-05 ran off, while the Yen encircled 110.00 within a 109.90-110.20 range and Euro gradually drifted towards 1.1100 where even bigger option expiry interest sat (2.5 bn) having briefly breached a key technical level in the form of the 200 DMA (1.1138). Elsewhere, the Loonie has been lethargic nearer the base of a 1.3049-79 band and unable to build on yesterday’s brighter BoC outlook survey elements.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has been propping up the G10 table for the most part, largely on a loss of momentum from circa 0.6634 overnight highs vs its US peer forged after upbeat Chinese trade data and confirmation that China has been removed from the aforementioned category of deliberate currency depreciators. Nzd/Usd has subsequently skirted 0.6600 and Aud/Nzd climbed to within a whisker of 1.0450 ahead of tonight’s NZ food price index.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have both retreated from early highs on a mixture of chart based selling and a partial recovery in crude prices, but the latter is lagging on the way back down after soft Swedish household consumption prints. Meanwhile, contrasting fortunes for the Try and Cnh as the breakdown of Libya peace talks on Haftar hesitation hampered the Lira, but the Yuan maintained positivity on the trade data and FX news noted above awaiting tomorrow’s Phase One accord signing and hopefully full details of the deal.</p>",

UBS thinks upside will be driven in the food and energy components, given that gasoline prices rose by 2.75% in December. The ‘other goods’ category may also continue to see upside, as the impact of the September tariffs continues to feed through, but UBS notes that, up until now, the impact has been modest. Lloyd’s are also in view of the general consensus, however the desk highlights inflation is not a particular concern at the Fed right now, where instead policy makers are focusing on how the economy fared in Q4; eyes on retail sales Thursday, industrial production, preliminary University of Michigan survey and housing data on Friday.</li><li>Looking ahead, UBS sees the Y/Y CPI rate rising to 2.5% in the January data, before slowing again; and similarly, sees the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, core PCE, rising to the 2.0% target in the spring, before easing. NOTE: Many policy makers have expressed that for any chance of a rate hike, inflation would have to drastically rise past the banks 2% target, although currently standing this is unlikely for some time with the Fed currently on hold; current market pricing sees no rate changes throughout the year and beyond.</li></ul>",

(-0.3%)</strong> also initially benefitted from the trade developments in which the US backtracked just 5 months after it had labelled China a currency manipulator and with the initial details of the Phase 1 deal said to confirm China’s pledge to buy USD 200bln of US goods over a 2-year period, while the latest Chinese trade data added to the encouragement as Trade Balance, Exports and Imports mostly surpassed estimates for December although Chinese markets eventually gave back their gains and the data had also showed trade with the US contracted by 10.7% Y/Y throughout 2019. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower and slipped below the 152.00 with demand dampened by the gains across stocks and with a relatively tepid BoJ Rinban announcement for just JPY 130bln of JGBs doing little to underpin prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Furthermore, the report added that no major US trading partner met the criteria to be designated a currency manipulator and that it is continuing to monitor China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Switzerland currency practices, while Taiwan and Thailand are nearing the threshold to be added into the monitoring list.

(Politico)</p><p>USTR Lighthizer said they have about finished translation of the Phase 1 deal which includes commitment regarding currency manipulation, while White House Trade Adviser Navarro commented that the Phase 1 deal will allow the US to swiftly reimpose tariffs if it unilaterally determines that China has broken any of its commitments.

Equity markets remain on standby ahead of US earnings season, which is set to kick off today, and with traders also eyeing tomorrow’s US-China Phase One deal signing. Sectors are largely in the green with no clear reflection of the overall risk sentiment. Individual movers have garnered more attention – with reports of credit card gambling to be banned in April this year weighing down on the likes of William Hill (-1.2%) and GVC (-0.8%), albeit the shares are off lows seen at the open. Meanwhile, Dialog Semiconductor (-1.4%) fell post-earnings after reporting a deterioration in EPS. Renault (-0.2%) failed to gain much traction after yesterday’s reports of a supposed end to the Nissan-Renault alliance were dismissed. Evonik (-4.2%) fell and remains at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after noting that revenue will be slightly below the prior YY and after RAG-Stiftung proposed the sale of around 24mln shares in the Co. On the flip side, miners are benefitting from yesterday’s surge in copper prices with Antofagasta (+1.7%), Glencore (+0.6%) also experiencing tailwinds from broker upgrades. Head-up, US earnings season will unofficially commence with earnings from JP Morgan, who accounts for around 3.2% of the DJIA, Wells Fargo and Citi.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar is holding a modestly firm line, with the DXY just shy of the 97.500 level ahead of US inflation data that is forecast to accelerate in headline terms and remain steady at the core. However, the Greenback’s stability between 97.455-339 owes much to weakness elsewhere as only the Swiss Franc is stronger amongst major currency peers, with Usd/Chf back below 0.9700 and Eur/Chf sub-1.0800.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY/EUR - </strong>The Pound is still succumbing to downside pressure on downbeat UK data and dovish BoE policy implications, as Cable extends declines through 1.3000 to circa 1.2955 and Eur/Gbp breaches December peaks before running into resistance ahead of 0.8600 and highs from November just pips above the round number. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost mild traction gleaned from Monday’s relatively encouraging Q4 BoC business survey findings, with Usd/Cad back above 1.3050, while the Aussie and Kiwi have also handed back some gains made on the back of strong Chinese trade data overnight and confirmation that China has made enough FX pledges within the Phase 1 trade accord for the US to retract it from the currency manipulation list. Aud/Usd is under 0.6900 again, but may derive underlying support given hefty option expiry interest at 0.6900-05 (1.3 bn) and Nzd/Usd is losing altitude between 0.6634-17 parameters ahead of December’s NZ food price index. Conversely, the Yen is trying to pare losses within a 109.90-110.20 range amidst a degree of consolidation in broad risk sentiment, and the Euro is firm on the 1.1100 handle, albeit failing to sustain gains beyond 1.1145 after eclipsing the 200 DMA and flanked by more big expiries (2.2 bn between 1.1160-70 and 2.5 bn at the 1.1100 strike).</p><p><strong>SCANDI - </strong>The Crowns are narrowly mixed with Eur/Sek elevated in a circa 10.5590-10.5285 band vs Eur/Nok straddling 9.9000 after weaker than forecast Swedish household consumption metrics and with the latter keeping tabs with oil prices.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>A decent pick-up in Turkish IP has not really helped the Lira to escape more geopolitical jitters as efforts to broker peace in Libya have been scuppered by the Hafta group leaving talks in Russia without signing on the dotted line. Usd/Try is hovering just below 5.9000 and extending its rebound in contrast to Usd/Cnh that continues to probe lower after breaching 6.9000 on the aforementioned US-China trade and FX positivity. Note also, Nomura notes that CTAs have flipped positions to net Yuan long vs the Buck for the first time since the start of Q2 last year, while covering shorts in the non-US Dollar commodity bloc</p><p><strong>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: <strong>1.1100 (2.5BLN),</strong> 1.1140-50 (750M), <strong>1.1160-70 (2.2BLN), 1.1190-1.1200 (1.2BLN)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUD/USD: 0.6870 (278M), 0.6890 (250M), <strong>0.6900-05 (1.3BLN),</strong> 0.6930-35 (760M)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core bonds</strong> remain bid, but off best levels as stocks and risk sentiment in general settle down after several wobbles since the start of EU trade.<strong> Bunds</strong> are back below 171.00 after poking their head above the parapet, albeit still comfortably above the 170.65 Eurex base and more on an even keel with Gilts at 132.23 within 132.47-10 Liffe extremes that may be seeing some post-DMO auction hedge unwinding following decent, though not especially strong results. However, <strong>Spanish Bonds</strong> are hugging intraday highs amidst stonking demand for the new 2030 syndication and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are closer to overnight session peaks than troughs ahead of CPI data and a couple of Fed speakers.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent front-month futures are ultimately on a firmer footing</strong> after erasing overnight losses - with the former rebounding off its 200 DMA (USD 57.74/bbl) whilst the latter found a base around the psychological USD 64/bbl mark. News flow has been light for the session thus far, although eyes remain on macro developments such as Middle Eastern tensions and US-China trade. Desks note that expectations for a well-supplied market are not currently reflected in the time spreads, with ICE Brent spreads still in deep backwardation, suggesting the physical market remains tight. On a more micro-level, traders will be looking for the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook and API releases later today, with ING noting that participants would be eyeing the former for its forecast of US production growth; “with the falling rig count, the positive supply growth estimates for the US are increasingly coming under question”, the Dutch bank says. Wednesday will see the release of the OPEC monthly report, followed by the IEA’s report on Thursday to round up this month’s oil market releases. Elsewhere<strong>, spot gold</strong> remains tentative just below USD 1550/oz amid a lack of fresh fundamental catalysts, albeit the yellow metal printed a fresh YTD low ~USD 1536/oz overnight.<strong> Copper</strong> meanwhile holds onto a lion’s share of yesterday’s gains after prices briefly topped USD 2.85/lb – with traders citing an overall more positive macro sentiment, with the Phase One deal signing inching closer. Finally, industry sources note that Chinese demand for high-grade <strong>iron</strong> is poised to drop as steel mills attempt to cut costs and raise profit margins.</p>",

Equity markets remain on standby ahead of US earnings season, which is set to kick off today, and with traders also eyeing tomorrow’s US-China Phase One deal signing. Sectors are largely in the green with no clear reflection of the overall risk sentiment. Individual movers have garnered more attention – with reports of credit card gambling to be banned in April this year weighing down on the likes of William Hill (-1.2%) and GVC (-0.8%), albeit the shares are off lows seen at the open. Meanwhile, Dialog Semiconductor (-1.4%) fell post-earnings after reporting a deterioration in EPS. Renault (-0.2%) failed to gain much traction after yesterday’s reports of a supposed end to the Nissan-Renault alliance were dismissed. Evonik (-4.2%) fell and remains at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after noting that revenue will be slightly below the prior YY and after RAG-Stiftung proposed the sale of around 24mln shares in the Co. On the flip side, miners are benefitting from yesterday’s surge in copper prices with Antofagasta (+1.7%), Glencore (+0.6%) also experiencing tailwinds from broker upgrades. Head-up, US earnings season will unofficially commence with earnings from JP Morgan, who accounts for around 3.2% of the DJIA, Wells Fargo and Citi.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar is holding a modestly firm line, with the DXY just shy of the 97.500 level ahead of US inflation data that is forecast to accelerate in headline terms and remain steady at the core. However, the Greenback’s stability between 97.455-339 owes much to weakness elsewhere as only the Swiss Franc is stronger amongst major currency peers, with Usd/Chf back below 0.9700 and Eur/Chf sub-1.0800.</p><p>GBP/CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY/EUR - The Pound is still succumbing to downside pressure on downbeat UK data and dovish BoE policy implications, as Cable extends declines through 1.3000 to circa 1.2955 and Eur/Gbp breaches December peaks before running into resistance ahead of 0.8600 and highs from November just pips above the round number. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost mild traction gleaned from Monday’s relatively encouraging Q4 BoC business survey findings, with Usd/Cad back above 1.3050, while the Aussie and Kiwi have also handed back some gains made on the back of strong Chinese trade data overnight and confirmation that China has made enough FX pledges within the Phase 1 trade accord for the US to retract it from the currency manipulation list. Aud/Usd is under 0.6900 again, but may derive underlying support given hefty option expiry interest at 0.6900-05 (1.3 bn) and Nzd/Usd is losing altitude between 0.6634-17 parameters ahead of December’s NZ food price index. Conversely, the Yen is trying to pare losses within a 109.90-110.20 range amidst a degree of consolidation in broad risk sentiment, and the Euro is firm on the 1.1100 handle, albeit failing to sustain gains beyond 1.1145 after eclipsing the 200 DMA and flanked by more big expiries (2.2 bn between 1.1160-70 and 2.5 bn at the 1.1100 strike).</p><p>SCANDI - The Crowns are narrowly mixed with Eur/Sek elevated in a circa 10.5590-10.5285 band vs Eur/Nok straddling 9.9000 after weaker than forecast Swedish household consumption metrics and with the latter keeping tabs with oil prices.</p><p>EM - A decent pick-up in Turkish IP has not really helped the Lira to escape more geopolitical jitters as efforts to broker peace in Libya have been scuppered by the Hafta group leaving talks in Russia without signing on the dotted line. Usd/Try is hovering just below 5.9000 and extending its rebound in contrast to Usd/Cnh that continues to probe lower after breaching 6.9000 on the aforementioned US-China trade and FX positivity. Note also, Nomura notes that CTAs have flipped positions to net Yuan long vs the Buck for the first time since the start of Q2 last year, while covering shorts in the non-US Dollar commodity bloc.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core bonds remain bid, but off best levels as stocks and risk sentiment in general settle down after several wobbles since the start of EU trade. <strong>Bunds</strong> are back below 171.00 after poking their head above the parapet, albeit still comfortably above the 170.65 Eurex base and more on an even keel with <strong>Gilts</strong> at 132.23 within 132.47-10 Liffe extremes that may be seeing some post-DMO auction hedge unwinding following decent, though not especially strong results. However, Spanish Bonds are hugging intraday highs amidst stonking demand for the new 2030 syndication and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are closer to overnight session peaks than troughs ahead of CPI data and a couple of Fed speakers.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month future are ultimately on a firmer footing after erasing overnight losses - with the former rebounding off its 200 DMA (USD 57.74/bbl) whilst the latter found a base around the psychological USD 64/bbl mark. News flow has been light for the session thus far, although eyes remain on macro developments such as Middle Eastern tensions and US-China trade. Desks note that expectations for a well-supplied market are not currently reflected in the time spreads, with ICE Brent spreads still in deep backwardation, suggesting the physical market remains tight. On a more micro-level, traders will be looking for the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook and API releases later today, with ING noting that participants would be eyeing the former for its forecast of US production growth; “with the falling rig count, the positive supply growth estimates for the US are increasingly coming under question”, the Dutch bank says. Wednesday will see the release of the OPEC monthly report, followed by the IEA’s report on Thursday to round up this month’s oil market releases. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains tentative just below USD 1550/oz amid a lack of fresh fundamental catalysts, albeit the yellow metal printed a fresh YTD low ~USD 1536/oz overnight. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile holds onto a lion’s share of yesterday’s gains after prices briefly topped USD 2.85/lb – with traders citing an overall more positive macro sentiment, with the Phase One deal signing inching closer. Finally, industry sources note that Chinese demand for high-grade <strong>iron</strong> is poised to drop as steel mills attempt to cut costs and raise profit margins.</p>",

However, the Greenback’s stability between 97.455-339 owes much to weakness elsewhere as only the <strong>Swiss Franc</strong> is stronger amongst major currency peers, with Usd/Chf back below 0.9700 and Eur/Chf sub-1.0800.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound is still succumbing to downside pressure on downbeat UK data and dovish BoE policy implications, as Cable extends declines through 1.3000 to circa 1.2955 and Eur/Gbp breaches December peaks before running into resistance ahead of 0.8600 and highs from November just pips above the round number. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost mild traction gleaned from Monday’s relatively encouraging Q4 BoC business survey findings, with Usd/Cad back above 1.3050, while the Aussie and Kiwi have also handed back some gains made on the back of strong Chinese trade data overnight and confirmation that China has made enough FX pledges within the Phase 1 trade accord for the US to retract it from the currency manipulation list. Aud/Usd is under 0.6900 again, but may derive underlying support given hefty option expiry interest at 0.6900-05 (1.3 bn) and Nzd/Usd is losing altitude between 0.6634-17 parameters ahead of December’s NZ food price index. Conversely, the Yen is trying to pare losses within a 109.90-110.20 range amidst a degree of consolidation in broad risk sentiment, and the Euro is firm on the 1.1100 handle, albeit failing to sustain gains beyond 1.1145 after eclipsing the 200 DMA and flanked by more big expiries (2.2 bn between 1.1160-70 and 2.5 bn at the 1.1100 strike).</p><p><strong>SCANDI</strong></p><p>The Crowns are narrowly mixed with Eur/Sek elevated in a circa 10.5590-10.5285 band vs Eur/Nok straddling 9.9000 after weaker than forecast Swedish household consumption metrics and with the latter keeping tabs with oil prices.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A decent pick-up in Turkish IP has not really helped the Lira to escape more geopolitical jitters as efforts to broker peace in Libya have been scuppered by the Hafta group leaving talks in Russia without signing on the dotted line. Usd/Try is hovering just below 5.9000 and extending its rebound in contrast to Usd/Cnh that continues to probe lower after breaching 6.9000 on the aforementioned US-China trade and FX positivity. Note also, Nomura notes that CTAs have flipped positions to net Yuan long vs the Buck for the first time since the start of Q2 last year, while covering shorts in the non-US Dollar commodity bloc.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Phase One signing imminent; focus shifts to Phase Two",
        "content": "<p><strong>*PHASE ONE OVERVIEW</strong></p><p>China’s Vice Premier Liu He has arrived in Washington for the much-anticipated signing of the US-China Phase One trade deal, with reports via WSJ suggesting that it will take place at the White House on January 15th at 11:30EST/16:30GMT/00:30HKT.</p><p>*<strong>THE NITTY-GRITTY</strong></p><p><strong>*China’s Currency Manipulation Status:</strong> US Treasury removed China from the currency manipulator list in its semi-annual report and said China made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation in the Phase One deal, but also noted that China needs to take necessary steps to avoid a persistently weak currency. Sources familiar with the negotiations noted that the currency manipulator designation previously had no real consequences for China, albeit its removal was a symbol of goodwill from the US for Chinese officials. As a result of the overall optimism, CNY strengthened further below 6.9000 vs. the USD to levels last seen in July last year.</p><p><strong>*China’s Agreed Purchases:</strong> Sources confirmed that the US-China Phase One deal will include a pledge by China to buy USD 200bln of US goods over a 2-year period. This is said to include USD 50bln in energy, USD 40bln in agriculture, USD 35bln-40bln in services and USD 75bln in manufactured goods. SCMP note that questions remain as to whether China can achieve the USD 40bln in agricultural purchases that the Trump administration is touting. China is yet to official confirm the buys.</p><p><strong>* Sticking Points:</strong> The Phase One deal does include various advances on some sticking points. China Global Times noted that the deal text includes nine chapters, including IPR, technology transfer, food and agriculture, financial services, exchange rate and transparency, expanding trade, bilateral evaluation, dispute settlement and final agreement. US business executives suggested the Phase One deal is ‘modest but helpful’. That said, China has been tempering optimism surrounding the overall trade war with the US, stating that “it is not over yet” via its social media proxy Taoran, which is affiliated with the Communist paper used to manage trade talk expectations. “The US hasn’t revoked all its tariffs on China and China is still implementing retaliatory measures. There are still many uncertainties down the road” - Toaran noted, cited by SCMP.</p><p><strong>*Enforcement:</strong> White House Trade Adviser Navarro asserted that the Phase One deal will allow the US to swiftly reimpose tariffs if it unilaterally determines that China has broken any of its commitments, including purchase agreements. China Global Times opinion tweeted that China will surely follow up its commitment to increase imports from the US once barriers such as tariffs and other administrative measures are lifted.</p><p><strong>*Semi-Annual Review:</strong> The two nations have also agreed on semi-annual dialogue to push reforms in US and China and resolve disputes. This agreement is also poised to be announced on January 15th alongside the signing of the of the Phase One trade deal, according to WSJ. The new talks dubbed “Comprehensive Economic Dialogue”, will be separate from the Phase Two negotiations.</p><p><strong>*PHASE TWO FOCUS</strong></p><p>With the Phase One signing almost certainly taking place, market focus now shifts onto Phase Two, which is said to contain a lion’s share of the remaining sticking points. Some desks note that the Phase One deal signing seems to be more theatre than meaningful change – noting that the semi-annual review as a simple return to conditions seen in 2016, whilst the dropped currency manipulation status is likely a move to acquire leverage against China alongside the majority of tariffs being kept in place.</p><p><strong>*Format:</strong> The actual format and timing of the Phase Two deal is not yet known. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin alluded late last year that Phase Two negotiations will begin after Phase One is out of the way, but may be compartmentalised – “Phase Two may be 2a, 2b, 2c, we’ll see, but this is unto itself a huge accomplishment for the president”, Mnuchin noted.</p><p><strong>*Timing:</strong> US President Trump last week he might want to wait till after the election to complete Phase Two China trade deal, but also said the US will begin Phase Two talks straight away. China Global Times, in response, tweeted that a Phase Two trade deal after November is too far away and added that China's willingness to start Phase Two negotiations depends on the implementation of the Phase One deal; citing an expert close to the Chinese Government. Furthermore, Global Times citing the expert close to the Chinese government, stated that China is not in a rush to begin Phase Two talks if US President Trump criticises the country during his election campaign.</p><p><strong>*BRIEF HISTORY OF US-SINO DEVELOPMENTS – </strong><a href=\"https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart\"><strong>Link</strong></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The move lower happened primarily in the earlier European session, with EGBs leading the losses and the Treasury curve following suit, seeing Bunds break through some technical levels in absence of major news flow or tier 1 data. The overall sentiment on the Phase 1 deal is leaning towards the positive side in light on recent media reports, with participants anticipating some hard purchases figures in the deal to be released upon signing on Wednesday. This cautious optimism saw the Treasury curve steepen slightly, with the 2-year yield rising 1bps and the 30-year yield up by just shy of 2bps. Attention now draws towards US CPI and the initiation of earnings season on Tuesday for investors to attain a better gauge of economic sentiment.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets were mostly higher as the region took its cue from the fresh record levels on Wall St amid the backdrop of the trade optimism heading into this week’s Phase 1 deal signing and after the US removed its designation of China as a currency manipulator. ASX 200 (+0.9%) followed suit to its US peers and posted a fresh all-time high led by tech and defensives, as well as the broad sectoral gains aside from gold miners which lagged due to losses in the precious metal, while Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) tested the 24k milestone on return from an extended weekend and with early advances spurred by a predominantly favourable currency. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) also initially benefitted from the trade developments in which the US backtracked just 5 months after it had labelled China a currency manipulator and with the initial details of the Phase 1 deal said to confirm China’s pledge to buy USD 200bln of US goods over a 2-year period, while the latest Chinese trade data added to the encouragement as Trade Balance, Exports and Imports mostly surpassed estimates for December although Chinese markets eventually gave back their gains and the data had also showed trade with the US contracted by 10.7% Y/Y throughout 2019. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower and slipped below the 152.00 with demand dampened by the gains across stocks and with a relatively tepid BoJ Rinban announcement for just JPY 130bln of JGBs doing little to underpin prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets are higher across the board as the region takes its cue from the fresh record levels on Wall St amid the backdrop of the trade optimism heading into this week’s Phase 1 deal signing and after the US removed its designation of China as a currency manipulator. ASX 200 (+0.7%) follows suit to its US peers and posted a fresh all-time high with tech and defensives leading the broad gains across its sectors aside from gold miners which lag due to further weakness in the precious metal, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) reclaimed the 24k milestone on return from the extended weekend with early gains spurred by a predominantly favourable currency. Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) also benefitted from the trade developments in which the US backtracked just 5 months after it had labelled China a currency manipulator and with the initial details of the Phase 1 deal said to confirm China’s pledge to buy USD 200bln of US goods over a 2-year period, while the latest Chinese trade data added to the encouragement as Trade Balance, Exports and Imports all surpassed estimates for December although showed trade with the US contracted by 10.7% Y/Y during the whole of 2019.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady below the 97.50 level amid indecisive trade across most its major counterparts with EUR/USD little changed around several DMA levels including the 200DMA at 1.1138 and with GBP/USD constrained below the 1.3000 handle as weak data added to the woes for the currency that had already been pressured from the increasingly dovish BoE rhetoric. Elsewhere, USD/JPY reclaimed 110.00 and JPY-crosses also broke out from the prior day’s ranges as the trade-related optimism and gains in stocks spurred safe-haven outflows, while CNH strengthened after a firmer PBoC reference rate setting and the US removal of its currency manipulator designation on China, which in turn supported AUD and NZD although the initial gains across the antipodeans eventually petered out heading into the Chinese trade data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower and have slipped below the 152.00 with demand dampened by the gains across stocks and with a relatively tepid BoJ Rinban announcement for just JPY 130bln of JGBs doing little to underpin prices.</p>",
