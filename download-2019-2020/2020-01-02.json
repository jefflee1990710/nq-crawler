Large Chinese ADRs surged on their first trading day of the year, helped by monetary easing in Beijing and anticipation of the US-China Phase One deal, particularly JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA), with the former also supported with a Buy initiation at Citic and the latter finding buyers after applying for a banking license in Singapore. HanesBrands (HBI) and Franklin Resources (BEN) opened the year on the back foot after Wells Fargo downgraded both names. Fastly (FSLY), BlackRock (BLK) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) all traded firmer on upgrades, the former at Piper Jaffray and the latter two at Wells Fargo. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was a top performer following a positive mention at Nomura – citing optimism for 2020 7nm chip product launches – in addition to wider risk appetite.

The Treasury curve has bull-flattened led by gains in the long-end of the curve, which saw 2s30s narrowing by around 5bps. Desks remind us that volume was thin, and the complex will likely get back into full swing next week when participants return. Analysts suggested that the richening was inspired by the new year rally in EGBs (the ECB today re-started purchasing assets under its PSPP after the break into the end of 2019). Accordingly, US 10-year yields fell back beneath 1.90%, having cheapened to around 1.94%; a few analysts have previously suggested that 1.95%-2.00% levels could be a prime 'dip' to be bought, a play that appears to have yielded gains thus far. Meanwhile, the US Treasury will sell USD 28bln in 3-year notes, USD 24bln in 10-year notes re-opening, and USD 16bln in 30-year bonds re-opening; all sizes were unchanged.</p>",

US President Trump also tweeted over the holiday period that he and China's President Xi would sign the agreement on 15th January in Washington (a translation of the deal is expected to be released beforehand), and Trump suggested that he would travel to Beijing to begin talks on the second phase. (RECAP: The phase one 'deal' involves the US partially rolling back some levies on Chinese imports in exchange for ramping up for Chinese purchases of US ags; the deal doesn’t include the more important structural reforms, like subsidies China gives to its own firms).</p><p><strong>* PBOC: </strong>China's central bank lowered banks' reserve requirements ratio by 50bps from the current 13% for large banks, and 11% for smaller banks, with the cut becoming effective of 6th January and marking the eighth of such since 2018. The move, which was telegraphed in remarks by Premier Li in late December, is expected to release CNY 800bln of liquidity (around USD 115bln), and aimed at lowering costs to the real economy, particularly for small and micro-enterprises, the PBOC said. Analysts noted the move was not unexpected, with many looking for the central bank to ease liquidity into the Spring Festival (25th January); and despite the marked easing in tensions between US/China over trade, analysts look for further lowering of the RRR. Banks will be required to price all new loans using the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) and will convert all existing loans to the new benchmark from 1st March 2020 through 31st August 2020. \"As such, there is still a possibility of another broad-based RRR cut in 2Q or 3Q this year depending on the pace of recovery of the domestic economy as well as the progress on the interest rate front,\" UOB's analysts wrote, and it sees the 1-year LPR rate falling from 4.15% currently to 3.80% by mid-2020, assuming the LPR moves lower by around 5bps each month on average into mid-2020, though UOB sees no further reduction to the Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF -- which the LPR is pegged to) after the 5bps cut to 3.25% in November.</p><p><strong>* FOMC MINUTES PRIMER: </strong>FOMC to release December 2019 meeting minutes at 1400 EST/1900 GMT on Friday 3rd January 2020. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-fomc-to-release-december-2019-meeting-minutes-at-1400-et-1900-gmt-on-friday-3rd-january-2020-02-01-2020\"><i>Click here for full Newsquawk primer.</i></a></p><p><strong>* US MARKIT MANUFACTURING PMI (FINAL DEC): </strong>The final read for December came in at 52.4, revised lower from the flash 52.5. Markit said the US manufacturing sector continued to recover from the soft patch seen in the summer, ending 2019 with its best quarter since the early months of 2019. The survey showed that the overall rate of expansion nevertheless faltered somewhat in December and remains well below that seen this time last year, which Markit said suggests that producers are starting 2020 on a softer footing than they had enjoyed heading into 2019. Markit also observed that business sentiment about the outlook remains especially subdued compared to a year ago, reflecting ongoing worries about geopolitics and trade wars, especially the impact of tariffs, as well as fears that political and economic uncertainty surrounding the 2020 elections could dampen demand. Finally, the impact of tariffs was clearly evident via higher prices, while the relatively subdued level of business confidence manifested itself in a pull-back in hiring, hinting at risk aversion and cost-cutting, according to the survey compiler.</p><p><strong>* CHINA CAIXIN MANUFACTURING PMI (DEC):</strong> The headline fell to 51.5 (consensus 51.6) from the two-year high of 51.8 in November, indicating that the health of China's economy continues to improve. However, new order growth softened, while export sales only ticked up slightly - new export orders, however, were more encouraging, rising above 50.0 for the first time since early 2018. The report also noted that the 12-month outlook sub-index remained relatively weak. However, some desks are surprised by the resiliency of the Caixin survey, as the official NBS manufacturing PMI remained at the lower 50.2, while industrial metal prices also hinted at weaker activity in December. Ahead, analysts think progress on the US/China trade front will continue to help drive stabilisation, but with that said, risks to domestic demand (via the property sector), will continue to warrant caution.</p><p><strong>* US DECEMBER CHALLENGER JOB CUTS:</strong>&nbsp;Announced job cuts by US based employers fell for a second straight month, to 32,843 – the lowest total since July 2018 (down 26% M/M, and down 25% Y/Y). “Confidence was high heading into the last month of the year. With some resolutions occurring in the trade war and strong consumer spending in the fourth quarter, companies appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach as we head into 2020,” Challenger said. For 2019 as a whole, employers announced plans to cut 592,556 jobs from their payrolls in 2019 -- 10% higher than the 538,695 cuts announced in 2018, and the highest annual total since 2015, when 598,510 cuts were announced. 2019 was the fourth-highest year for job cut announcements this decade.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE MARKIT MANUFACTURING PMI (FINAL DEC):</strong> The final December manufacturing PMI declined to 46.3 in December from 46.9 in November, though was above the expected 45.9. Markit noted that although Germany was again the worst performer, the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in over six-and-a-half years, and also highlighted that spare capacity weighed on employment with job losses the sharpest since the start of 2013. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the PMI for the EZ as a whole doesn’t look pretty. \"New orders and output are still falling, and while the rate of contraction—in new orders—has eased a tad, the overall picture is grim,\" noting that \"work backlogs were further reduced and inventory accumulation slowed at the end of Q4, which in turn, pushed the rate of job losses up to its fastest pace since 2013.\" Ahead, PM is optimistic that the Q4 data as a whole provide the first small piece of evidence that the pace of decline is easing, but the consultancy says it is not expecting much in the way of a rebound in H1 2020.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (NK, IR, TU): </strong>North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un stated that North Korea is no longer bound by previous agreements to halt missile tests, due to recent US actions alongside their co-operation with South Korea; adding that a ‘new strategic weapon’ would be unveiled soon. Many believe it could be a new type of Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), or an upgraded ICBM. Following this, US Defence Secretary Esper stated he is confident regarding the preparedness of US forces to deter North Korea’s bad behaviour. Elsewhere, the Iran backed militia, Hezbollah, were struck by the US in Iraq. The airstrikes led to protests by Iraqi paramilitary groups who have called on supporters to withdraw from the perimeter of the US’ embassy in Baghdad. However, it is yet to be confirmed if crowds have begun dispersing. US Defence Secretary Esper announced there are indications that Iran, or forces backed by Iran, are potentially planning additional attacks, noting the US will take pre-emptive action if this is the case. Over in Turkey, the Turkish parliament agreed to send troops to Libya, after Turkey’s President Erdogan announced he would seek parliamentary approval after a request from the Tripoli government who are allies with Turkey, and have been holding a civil war against Gen Khalifa Haftar in Eastern Libya.</p><p><strong>* UK MARKIT MANUFACTURING PMI (DEC):</strong> The Final December manufacturing PMI fell to 47.5 in December (consensus 47.8, flash was 47.4) from 48.9 in November. Markit noted that the UK manufacturing sector took a turn for the worse at the end of 2019, with output falling at the quickest pace in seven-and-a-half years as new order inflows decreased and Brexit safety stocks were reduced. The data compiler added that, with demand weak and confidence remaining subdued, input purchasing was pared back sharply and jobs cut for the ninth successive month.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> Through the holiday period, an article in the Daily Mail speculated that incoming BOE Governor Bailey might jettison the current forward guidance policy tool, and suggested that BOE watchers expect a return to the more conventional operation of monetary policy followed in the past.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> EU Trade Commissioner Hogan told the Irish Times that the UK would be forced to abandon its commitment not to extend its transition period beyond the end of 2020, adding that the next stage of negotiations would involve complex and difficult choices, and reiterated that the EU's top priority was to preserve the integrity of the single market.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLED USD 0.12 HIGHER AT USD 61.18/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.25 HIGHER AT USD 66.25/BBL. </strong>The crude complex traded slightly firmer in thin liquidity conditions, PVM highlighted participants are awaiting fresh catalysts, however on the technical front the desk is keeping an eye on the 13dma at 60.95 and 65.68 for WTI and Brent, respectively. Geopolitical tensions have increased in recent days as Turkey have agreed to send troops to Libya to help the Tripoli government with its civil war. Tensions in Iran have also picked up following a US air strike on the Iranian backed militia Hezbollah in Iraq, thus could have a potential threat to regional crude oil supplies, writes Citi. Although the latest geopolitical spats have had little impact on price action so far, any further escalation will be worth keeping an eye on. The latest weekly API figures saw crude draw 7.8mln bbls, Cushing -1.4mln bbls, Gasoline -0.776mln bbls and distillates +2.8mln bbls, ahead of the EIA officials release on Friday; analysts forecast (bbls) crude -3.3mln bbls, distillates +1.1mln bbls and Gasoline +1.8mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.84% at 3258; NDX +1.59% at 8872; DJIA +1.16% at 28870.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) made strong gains after Canaccord Genuity raised its PT to USD 515/share from USD 375/share, citing further acceleration towards electric vehicles. Large Chinese ADRs surged on their first trading day of the year, helped by monetary easing in Beijing and anticipation of the US-China Phase One deal, particularly JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA), with the former also supported with a Buy initiation at Citic and the latter finding buyers after applying for a banking license in Singapore. HanesBrands (HBI) and Franklin Resources (BEN) opened the year on the back foot after Wells Fargo downgraded both names. Fastly (FSLY), BlackRock (BLK) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) all traded firmer on upgrades, the former at Piper Jaffray and the latter two at Wells Fargo. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was a top performer following a positive mention at Nomura – citing optimism for 2020 7nm chip product launches – in addition to wider risk appetite. United Airlines (UAL) took off on the front foot after an upgrade at Evercore.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 128-20. </strong>The Treasury curve has bull-flattened led by gains in the long-end of the curve, which saw 2s30s narrowing by around 5bps. Desks remind us that volume was thin, and the complex will likely get back into full swing next week when participants return. Analysts suggested that the richening was inspired by the new year rally in EGBs (the ECB today re-started purchasing assets under its PSPP after the break into the end of 2019). Accordingly, US 10-year yields fell back beneath 1.90%, having cheapened to around 1.94%; a few analysts have previously suggested that 1.95%-2.00% levels could be a prime 'dip' to be bought, a play that appears to have yielded gains thus far. Meanwhile, the US Treasury will sell USD 28bln in 3-year notes, USD 24bln in 10-year notes re-opening, and USD 16bln in 30-year bonds re-opening; all sizes were unchanged.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> traded firmer today retracing some of its pre-Christmas losses following year-end rebalancing, however the index still lies beneath the 97.00 handle, trading from lows of 96.42 to highs of 96.88. Today’s PMI data failed to provide any fresh impetus to the buck’s movement given the final print was only slightly lower than the previous, plus participants will be eyeing tomorrow’s ISM manufacturing data for any fresh catalyst. A choppy day for the <strong>Euro</strong> with EURUSD falling from highs of 1.1225 to lows of 1.1164, however in the morning there was a quick reversal from 1.1175 to breach 1.12 to the upside, although the move was short-lived and extended back to the day’s lows, a level it resides around heading in to Asia trade. <strong>GBP</strong> also weaker as Cable lost 1.32 after initially trading at highs of 1.3266 before falling to lows of 1.3117, with today’s final PMI data doing little to help as it was revised lower. <strong>CAD</strong> traded flat against the buck today, with little reaction seen after the poor Markit PMI print, with USDCAD trading in a tight range throughout the session after losing the 1.30 handle trading in 1.2970 – 1.30 parameters. <strong>Havens</strong> were slightly bid today with <strong>JPY</strong> outpacing USD gains with the cross trading around the 108.50 mark heading into the Asia session. <strong>XAU</strong> also bid, with traders noting gold has settled higher for seven straight sessions, and one desk highlighting that CTA models have turned long on the precious metal. UBS Gold CTA tracker shows all 11 of the active strategies it tracks are now long, with the nearest exit level at USD 1492.90, with the desk also highlighting XAU’s positive seasonality in January of the last six years. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed with outperformance seen in <strong>MXN</strong>, despite poor PMI data which noted factory orders and exports fell at the fastest rates in survey history, resulting in record contractions in output and input buying. Banxico minutes highlighted that board member Esquivel was the one 50bp dissenter, and all board members expect Q4 weakness in the economy, noting it is still stagnant. The majority believed that core inflation has been persistent; upside for inflation has appeared which may make it challenging to attain their 3% target for 2020, due to announced increase in minimum wage. Note, the increase of minimum wage had led desks to believe a 50bp cut at its latest meeting was out of the question in case it spurred inflationary pressures taking it away from the 3% target. <strong>ZAR</strong> was the underperformer today, and USDZAR trades above the 14.00 handle amid broad dollar strength. <strong>BRL</strong> trades flat and <strong>TRY</strong> slightly weaker amid ongoing geopolitical concerns.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index has bounced a bit further from sub-96.500 levels towards 96.850 even though bear-steepening along the UST curve has reversed course relatively sharply, albeit in still thin seasonal volumes, and the Dollar trades somewhat mixed vs its currency counterparts overall. Perhaps a comparatively solid rather than strong final Markit manufacturing PMI has assisted the Greenback recovery along with sabre rattling on the geopolitical front, while several G10 rivals and EM peers have simply lost momentum and handed back more pre-2020 gains after running into technical resistance.</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The traditional safe-havens are on track to end the first (EU) session of the new year and decade on divergent paths, as the Yen and Gold outperform in stark contrast to the Franc as certain/select asset classes benefit from a degree of hedging/positioning for a potential downturn in risk sentiment. Usd/Jpy reversed from around 108.85 through 108.50 and tripped stops on a break of 108.40 to probe under 108.25, while Xau/Usd eclipsed December 31’s peak and climbed to within a few Bucks of the next bullish chart target circa 1536/oz. However, Usd/Chf failed make much headway either side of the 0.9700 handle as Eur/Chf straddled 1.0850 and the single currency regained a degree of composure vs the Greenback and Sterling around daily fixings.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Euro saw some pretty wild swings around the fixes, and some market contacts suggest this could have been exacerbated by the fact that Frankfurt and other continental European centres were closed for business on Xmas and New Year’s Eve. Indeed, Eur/Usd squeezed back up towards 1.1200 from lows near 1.1170 and Eur/Gbp rebounded to 0.8500 or so vs 0.8460 as Cable lost 1.3200 with no real support from an uptick in the final UK manufacturing PMI. On that note, mostly better than forecast or flash Eurozone manufacturing surveys hardly impacted the single currency, while the Antipodean Dollars gradually unwound post-US/China Phase 1 trade accord and PBoC RRR cut-related gains to sub-0.7000/0.6700 before the Kiwi reclaimed big figure+ status (just).</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie has pared losses suffered in wake of another worrying Canadian economic release in the form of RBC’s manufacturing PMI that slipped to 50.4 from 51.4 and closer to the boom/bust line.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>A bright start to 2020 for most regional currencies, aside from the Try that was subject to more investor angst on geopolitical factors after Turkey’s Government approved the deployment of troops to Libya.</p>",

Newsflow thus far for the session has been extremely light, with the main focus being on the PBoC cutting the RRR by 50bps which lent support to APAC equities overnight and continues to aid European peers and US futures; alongside the updates to the US-China trade deal signing schedule, though this is all largely as expected. Currently there is no clear under/out performer amongst European bourses, though the <strong>Dax</strong> did initially lag potentially as the bourse was closed on New Years Eve. Turning to sectors, the picture isn’t substantially different from the overall stock performance this morning with all sectors firmly in the green; banking sector mildly outperforms its peers, deriving support from the aforementioned PBoC action. It’s been a relatively quiet morning in terms of stock specific stories but Tullow Oil (-4.5%) are the laggard of the Stoxx 600 after reporting disappointing oil well data. Elsewhere, Osram Licht (U/C) shares are flat after AMS reported a final acceptance level of 59.9% for their takeover of Osram, which is below the final acceptance level of 75% which is necessary for a full takeover. At the other end of the Stoxx 600 spectrum things are a quieter, with stocks largely in-line with indices overall performance, whilst a number of banking names such as Deutsche Bank (+5.0%) reside towards the top of the Stoxx 600. Finally, 3 Axis Advisors states that GSK (+0.4%), Sanofi (1.0%) and <strong>Pfizer</strong> are to increase prices on over 200 drugs within the US.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD – The DXY appears to have drawn a line in the sand just off 5 month lows following a sharp slide between Xmas and New Year amidst widespread Greenback declines and positioning for the turn of the year/decade. The index is currently holding a fraction above 96.600 within a tight 96.422-678 range with some support for the Buck gleaned via higher US Treasury yields and a steeper curve on a continuation of improved risk sentiment due to the US and China reaching a Phase 1 trade accord, with added impetus coming via the latter announcing another RRR reduction to take effect from next Monday.</p><p>SEK/NOK - The Scandinavian Crowns have kicked off 2020 on the front foot, as Eur/Sek meanders between 10.5000-4500 or so parameters and Eur/Nok hovers within a circa 9.8550-8175 band in wake of a recovery in Sweden’s manufacturing PMI and acceleration in Norwegian activity from an already comfortable 50+ base.</p><p>CAD/EUR/JPY/CHF/AUD/GBP/NZD - The Loonie is holding up better than G10 rivals and has retained the bulk of its pre-year end gains vs the Usd after advancing through the key/psychological 1.3000 level, while the Euro is struggling to keep its head above 1.1200 even though Eurozone manufacturing PMIs beat consensus or flash prints, bar Italy. Elsewhere, the Yen and Franc have also succumbed to the broad, albeit partial Dollar bounce, and aforementioned ongoing risk-on environment, with Usd/Jpy edging up towards 108.90 and Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9700. However, the Aussie, Pound and Kiwi have all lost momentum and seem vulnerable to deeper pull-backs/retracement from recent peaks, as Aud/Usd loses grip of 0.7000, Cable creeps closer to 1.3200 again and Nzd/Usd hovers a fraction over 0.6700.</p><p>EM - With the exception of Turkey’s geopolitically impaired Lira, most regional currencies are revelling in the PBoC inspired enhanced appetite for risk, as the Yuans consolidate advances beyond 7.0000, Rouble eyes 61.5000 having breached 62.0000 and Rand maintains 14.0000+ status.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s been a slow grind, but core EU bonds have embarked on more pronounced recovery rallies and relatively firm if not quite strong rebounds from am session/intraday lows, as the German 10 year debt future trades 40 ticks above the Eurex base and its UK peer pares losses to only 19 ticks from ¾ point at one stage. <strong>Bunds</strong> and<strong> Gilts</strong> have decoupled from any inverse correlation with stocks, and may have derived some traction after manufacturing PMIs revealed a degree of improvement, but no major upside surprises, while FX developments look supportive as the single currency loses 1.1200 vs the Greenback and Sterling retreats further towards 1.3200. Note also, chart proponents could have drawn encouragement from the fact that 170.00 and the 130.45 held, as <strong>US Treasuries</strong> hover just shy of overnight session highs, though still sub-parity ahead of weekly claims and the final Markit manufacturing PMI.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A similarly quiet session in terms of newsflow for the commodity complex, with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> firmer by around USD 0.30/bbl; supported by the risk-on tone across markets this morning, particularly in European stocks. Focus for the complex remains on geopolitical issues, with an Iran-backed Iraqi militia leaving their encampment at the US embassy in Baghdad; though this de-escalation is not likely to be a supportive factor for crude. Looking ahead, due to the holiday period the week’s EIA data will be released tomorrow at 16:00GMT with expectations for another headline draw at 3.167mln barrels. Turning to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> is modestly firmer this morning with the yellow-metal comfortable well above the USD 1500/oz mark at USD 1521/oz at best for the session thus far, continuing to be bolstered by the significant downside in the DXY over the holiday period. Separately, China’s largest steel making city Tangshen has issued a level 2 out of 3 smog alert; for reference, this alert requires non-exempt companies to cut emissions and/or output until the alert is reduced.</p>",
