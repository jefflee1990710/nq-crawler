The tariffs proposed are on passenger helicopters, wines, cheeses, ski-suits and certain motorcycles; additional tariffs on the EU’s power house auto sector are too being considered. The European Commission responded saying the tariffs are “greatly exaggerated”, and then reports followed through that the Commission had begun preparing retaliation tariffs in response; however the EU did say it was open to talks with the US in regard to the subsidies on Airbus. President Trump doubled down on the threats, where he tweeted that subsidies of Airbus had been damaging to the US. Away from the US, following meetings between Chinese and EU officials in Brussels, EU Council President Tusk said that the talks had been tough, but ultimately fruitful, and that a breakthrough on subsidies had been made. EU’s Juncker said that they are working to remove barriers to market access, with the aim being to agree an investment pact by the end of 2020; Chinese Premier Li said they need to accelerate talks on the pact.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW – FOMC MINUTES (MARCH MEETING): </strong>The meeting minutes will reveal the FOMC’s thinking behind moving to a neutral stance, and the central bank is likely to have judged rates should remain on hold. The FFR path was revised down at the meeting, and the FOMC lowered its growth view. Traders will be looking for more details on the balance sheet run-off. Elsewhere, there will be attention on any discussions, if any, that the Committee may have had on loosening policy. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21572/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p><p><strong>* PREVIEW – ECB RATE DECISION:</strong> Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. ECB are expected to maintain current guidance on rates, reinvestments, growth and inflation. President Draghi unlikely to offer much in the way of concrete details on TLTRO3 or tiered rates. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21558/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p><p><strong>* US NFIB: </strong>The March US small business optimism index rose by 0.1 points to 101.8. Wells Fargo Economics’ analysts highlight, “While the index has fallen from lofty highs of recent years, optimism remains elevated and businesses continue to report plans to expand.” Looking beneath the index, the consumer confidence component remained strong, whilst the amount of firms expecting the economy to improve stayed relatively unchanged at 10.8%, “however those reporting that now was a good time to expand increased to 22.6%.” Small business hiring plans increased at a more cautious rate which confirms Wells’ view of “a more moderate pace of hiring this year.” The bank also noted that both firms reporting a raise in selling prices and firms expecting to raise prices both dipped lower in March, “reflecting more modest price pressures in coming months.”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The Lords late on Monday, and the HoC on Tuesday, passed a Bill requiring UK PM May to request an Article 50 extension if there is no deal, although the motion seems somewhat mitigated given May's request for an extension to be granted until 30 June. On Tuesday, reports suggested that the EU will grant the UK an Article 50 extension, though it may exact a high price for delaying Brexit, including UK to give up rights in future EU budget and trade talks, and additionally, it could force the UK into a no-deal Brexit if it seeks to cancel elections to European Parliament; there were also mixed reports that Germany would allow a 5-year time limit to the Irish backstop, though this was denied by Berlin. UK PM May and German Chancellor Merkel both discussed a Brexit extension to 30 June, at their meeting, and the two leaders agreed on need for an orderly Brexit; May also outlined plans to conclude Brexit at the Emergency Summit. Her counterpart Merkel was reportedly showing support for a flexible Brexit extension. Elsewhere, the UK solicitor general said he cannot be certain that an A50 extension to 22/May would give enough time to achieve a Brexit deal (NOTE: May has already requested an extension to 30 June). US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that the US is preparing for a hard Brexit as a “very realistic outcome.”</p><p><strong>* IMF: </strong>The<strong> </strong>IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3% from 3.5%, 2020 forecast unchanged at 3.6%. It cut its US growth forecast for 2019 to 2.3% from 2.5%, raised 2020 forecast to 1.9% from 1.8%. It cut its Euro-Area 2019 growth forecast to 1.35 from 1.6%. The IMF said that the Fed's patient approach is appropriate. It said that the German slowdown may require 'prompt' fiscal measures, and that the ECB should keep monetary policy as accommodative. Adding that the BoE should be 'cautious', and that a no-deal Brexit could hit UK &amp; EU economies hard. IMF official said coordinated stimulus and synchronised fiscal stimulus might be needed if downside risks to global economy materialises</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO: US EIA cuts 2019 world oil demand forecast by 50k BPD (to +1.4mln BPD YY), and also cut 2020 world oil demand growth by 10k BPD (to +1.45mln BPD YY) The EIA also expects US crude output to rise in 2019 by 1.43mln BPD (to 12.39mln BPD vs a previous 1.35mln BPD rise), and expects US crude output to rise in 2020 by 710K BPD to 13.10mln BPD (prev. +730K BPD). The EIA also thinks that US oil demand will rise by 360K BPD in 2019 (unchanged), and sees US demand rising by 250K BPD in 2020 (prev. 220K BPD rise).</strong></p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 0.42 LOWER AT USD 63.98/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLED USD 0.49 LOWER AT USD 70.61/BBL. </strong>After two green days, WTI and Brent both are red for the session ahead of weekly inventory data. Understanding moves in Brent has been fairly straightforward as of late: OPEC supply cut deal and geopolitical tensions are tightening the market, as reflected in Brent's rising backwardation. Sanctions on Venezuela and tensions in Libya add to the narrative of tightening supply (though the latter's production has not been impacted just yet). There is also Monday's news that the Trump administration are to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organisation, ramping up tensions further. The strength of WTI is a little more puzzling, ING says: while it can partly be explained by last week's closure of the Houston Shipping Channel (which contributed to a lumpy build in the weekly inventory data), ING is still somewhat surprised by the relative strength in WTI, particularly given that US crude oil inventories have remained stubbornly high for both total US commercial crude inventories and stocks in Cushing. Accordingly, the Brent/WTI arb has been in focus, and slightly narrowed today (vs Monday's levels around USD 6.50). It is worth keeping an eye on US oil exports in this week's inventory data. Further strength of WTI could weigh on exports; ING notes that US exports have already fallen from their weekly high of 3.6mln BPD in mid-February (a time when the WTI/Brent arb was around USD 10.00) to around 2.7mln BPD in last week's EIA report. Energy inventory expectations: Crude +2.3mln, Cushing -0.419mln, Distillate -1.3mln, Gasoline -2.0mln.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.6% at 2878, NDX -0.4% at 7568, DJI -0.7% at 26150. SECTORS: Energy -1.3%, Materials -0.8%, Industrials -1.4%, Communications -0.5%, Cons Discretionary -0.9%, Cons Staples -0.2%, Healthcare -0.4%, Financials -0.9%, Tech -0.5%, Telecoms +0.0%, Utilities +0.3%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) fell after reports emerged that the 737 grounding is costing USD 1bln per month. Apple (AAPL) shares were initially buoyed after Wedbush raised its price target, however the stock went on to snap a 10 day runs of gains with some suggestions of profit taking. Facebook (FB) shares traded higher after Morgan Stanley commented positively on Instagram monetising it’s Stories feature. Disney (DIS) and Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp (COG) traded up after both receiving upgrades from Cowen &amp; Co, who raised both firms’ ratings to ‘outperform’. US financials including, JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) all traded lower after a story emerged suggesting US big banks will report weak investment banking fees. Pentair (PNR) shares fell after the water treatment company forecast full-year profits below expectations on the back of cold weather. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) snaps an 8-day win streak on reports of an M&amp;A deal with Crown Resorts (CWLDY). Cerner Corp (CERN) posted its best daily gain in over 5 years after reports emerged of an agreement with activist investor Starboard involving a USD 1.2bln buyback plan. United States Steel Corp (X) shares plummeted after being downgraded to ‘underperform’ by Credit Suisse.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (M9) FUTURES SETTLE 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-20+. </strong>Yields narrowed slightly along the curve in light trade ahead of Wednesday’s risk events (FOMC mins, Clarida speaks after market, ECB, Brexit conference). A soft NFIB survey resulted in some buying interest, and Trump’s Twitter trade war salvos also found buyers. The IMF lower growth expectations were also cited as a reason to buy. The Aramco offering of USD 12bln 5-parter didn’t dent the complex too much, despite books reportedly climbing over USD 100bln. The Treasury’s sale of USD 38bln of 3-year notes was ho hum; the auctioned tailed, and the yield was the lowest since Feb 2018. Direct participation rose sharply. Tomorrow the Treasury will auction 10-year notes; the last 10s auction stopped-through the screens, and saw the lowest yield at auction since Jan 2018; cover, meanwhile, was the highest since June, with dealers taking their lowest takedown since March 2017, leaving investment funds with a slightly higher takedown, while foreign participation was relatively unchanged. The latest positioning data indicated dealer holdings rose to a 5-week high in the latest data, to USD 13.89bln. Analysts at SocGen said that the sector appears cheap for the current auction cycle on asset swap vs the March auction cycle, and also says that the current 10 is cheap on the curve vs 5s and 30s. SocGen thinks the auction is likely to see a positive takedown.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Newswires were attributing the USD weakness to heightened trade tensions (this time the US aiming at the EU), while the IMF cutting its global growth view did little to help. There was some positive points in the IMF report; while the US and European near-term growth view was cut, the IMF raised China growth forecast slightly, and talked about stability in the nation - as we have seen in recent PMI data for Feb and March. The DXY is sitting on the 97.00 figure (a new low for April) as we head into APAC trade, ahead of FOMC minutes on Wednesday, and before then, Fed's Clarida speaks overnight. Also in central bank activity, the ECB meeting on Wednesday will likely be a dull affair, and the EUR is sitting at unchanged levels as we end the US session. AUD watchers will be tuned in to comments from the RBA dep gov Debelle overnight, who will be speaking on the state of the economy. EMFX was mixed with the MXN and ZAR gaining, although RUB, NOK and CAD were weaker as oil fell, while importers (KRW, INR, TRY) were mixed with INR slightly firmer ahead of the start of elections on Thursday.</p>",

A soft NFIB survey resulted in some buying interest, and Trump’s Twitter trade war salvos also found buyers. The IMF lower growth expectations were also cited as a reason to buy. The Aramco offering of USD 12bln 5-parter didn’t dent the complex too much, despite books reportedly climbing over USD 100bln. The Treasury’s sale of USD 38bln of 3-year notes was ho hum; the auctioned tailed, and the yield was the lowest since Feb 2018. Direct participation rose sharply. Tomorrow the Treasury will auction 10-year notes; the last 10s auction stopped-through the screens, and saw the lowest yield at auction since Jan 2018; cover, meanwhile, was the highest since June, with dealers taking their lowest takedown since March 2017, leaving investment funds with a slightly higher takedown, while foreign participation was relatively unchanged. The latest positioning data indicated dealer holdings rose to a 5-week high in the latest data, to USD 13.89bln. Analysts at SocGen said that the sector appears cheap for the current auction cycle on asset swap vs the March auction cycle, and also says that the current 10 is cheap on the curve vs 5s and 30s. SocGen thinks the auction is likely to see a positive takedown.</p>",

The DXY is sitting on the 97.00 figure (a new low for April) as we head into APAC trade, ahead of FOMC minutes on Wednesday, and before then, Fed's Clarida speaks overnight. Also in central bank activity, the ECB meeting on Wednesday will likely be a dull affair, and the EUR is sitting at unchanged levels as we end the US session. AUD watchers will be tuned in to comments from the RBA dep gov Debelle overnight, who will be speaking on the state of the economy. EMFX was mixed with the MXN and ZAR gaining, although RUB, NOK and CAD were weaker as oil fell, while importers (KRW, INR, TRY) were mixed with INR slightly firmer ahead of the start of elections on Thursday.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* EIA STEO: </strong>US EIA cuts 2019 world oil demand forecast by 50k BPD (to +1.4mln BPD YY), and also cut 2020 world oil demand growth by 10k BPD (to +1.45mln BPD YY) The EIA also expects US crude output to rise in 2019 by 1.43mln BPD (to 12.39mln BPD vs a previous 1.35mln BPD rise), and expects US crude output to rise in 2020 by 710K BPD to 13.10mln BPD (prev. +730K BPD). The EIA also thinks that US oil demand will rise by 360K BPD in 2019 (unchanged), and sees US demand rising by 250K BPD in 2020 (prev. 220K BPD rise).</p><p><strong>* CRUDE:</strong> After two green days, WTI and Brent both are red for the session ahead of weekly inventory data. Understanding moves in Brent has been fairly straightforward as of late: OPEC supply cut deal and geopolitical tensions are tightening the market, as reflected in Brent's rising backwardation. Sanctions on Venezuela and tensions in Libya add to the narrative of tightening supply (though the latter's production has not been impacted just yet). There is also Monday's news that the Trump administration are to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organisation, ramping up tensions further. The strength of WTI is a little more puzzling, ING says: while it can partly be explained by last week's closure of the Houston Shipping Channel (which contributed to a lumpy build in the weekly inventory data), ING is still somewhat surprised by the relative strength in WTI, particularly given that US crude oil inventories have remained stubbornly high for both total US commercial crude inventories and stocks in Cushing. Accordingly, the Brent/WTI arb has been in focus, and slightly narrowed today (vs Monday's levels around USD 6.50). It is worth keeping an eye on US oil exports in this week's inventory data. Further strength of WTI could weigh on exports; ING notes that US exports have already fallen from their weekly high of 3.6mln BPD in mid-February (a time when the WTI/Brent arb was around USD 10.00) to around 2.7mln BPD in last week's EIA report.</p>",

        "content": "<p>* WEEK'S SUPPLY: The US Treasury will this week auction USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tue), 10-year (USD 24bln, Wed) and 30-year (USD 16blnm Thu). With USD 77.8bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise around USD 200mln in new cash, according to TD Securities. The bank adds that with USD 180mln maturing on the Fed's balance sheet, there will be nearly no add-ons at mid-month settlement.&nbsp;</p><p>* RECENT AUCTIONS: Have generally performed well, with investors piling into havens at the beginning of the year amid the market uncertainty. While market pricing remains elevated (around 50% chance of a rate cut by the end of the year), it has backed off from extremes. TD Securities expects that, with the Fed's balance sheet run-off ending in October, the bank expects the Treasury to cut auction sizes in the 2-year to 3-year sector, which could support demand at the front-end.&nbsp;</p><p>* 3-YEAR AUCTION: Cover was higher at the previous 3-year auction to the highest in 2019 (2.6x) even as yields declined in the run up to the auction. Final demand, however, was somewhat weak, Barclays notes, with dealers taking down marginally more supply than the first two auctions in the year. The prior auctions tailed by 0.4bps, which was wider than the recent average around 0.2bps. In terms of the upcoming auction, Barclays says the current 3-year note (the March 2022) is a potential deferred cheapest-to-date candidate in TUM0 and trades rich on the curve, similar to other deferred TU CTD securities (i.e., Dec21s, Sep21s, and Jun21s). As a result, Barclays estimates that the WI should trade at a liquidity discount to current 3s. \"Furthermore, the quoted roll is biased higher due to the 0.6bps bad day adjustment in the WI; the bond matures on Good Friday (April 15, 2022), which is no settlement,\" adding that they believe that the WI roll is appropriately priced.\"</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/7849d7a3-20e7-4afc-beb9-987e24e7ca60.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The Yen is now in pole position within the major ranks amidst a gradual erosion of risk appetite due to a growing list of bearish impulses and factors, including heightened prospects of reciprocal US-EU trade tariffs, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and more IMF growth forecast downgrades. Moreover, the Fund delivered another warning that downside risks could materialise and warrant coordinated/synchronised stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, while major risk events looming tomorrow may also have prompted some safe-haven or defensive positioning. Usd/Jpy tripped stops through the 111.25-22 area and earlier intraday low around 111.24, with decent option expiries between 111.25-20 (1.8 bn) not providing much in the way of support on the way to and just through 111.00. Next in line for bears is 110.92 which is the 100 DMA and also close to a couple of other chart support levels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR</strong></p><p>Vying for 2nd spot as the Aussie fades on the overall deterioration in sentiment tone after outperforming for the most part in wake of encouraging home loan stats overnight and another rise in iron ore prices alongside other commodities. Aud/Usd lost momentum just above 0.7150 and now looks set to end Tuesday’s EU session below a key Fib (0.7149) and the 100 DMA (0.7142). Similarly, the single currency drifted back from a marginal new recent high vs the Greenback, which coincided with Fib resistance at 1.1284, as the <strong>DXY</strong> managed to hold just above chart support at 96.806 within a 97.085-96.853 range, but remains underpinned having breached 1.1250 yesterday.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd as the Kiwi slipped back below 0.6750 in sympathy with its Antipodean peer and the Aud/Nzd cross held towards the upper end of 1.0595-60 trading parameters. Meanwhile, the Franc meandered between 0.9998-81 with unchanged and as forecast Swiss jobless rates hardly registering, but Cable was considerably more choppy within a 1.3045-1.3121 band against the backdrop of yet more conflicting Brexit-related headlines, and especially reports about German Chancellor Merkel is willing to look at a 5 year limit to the Irish backstop that were subsequently denied. Finally, the Loonie lost momentum from sub-1.3000 vs its US rival as crude retreated from best levels and the WTO rejected Canada’s appeal against US softwood lumber levies.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some respite for the Try even though the ruling party refuses to give up on Istanbul and persists with efforts to overturn the electoral board’s ruling that a limited recount is appropriate. However, the Lira is still close to worst levels circa 5.6800 vs the Buck ahead of Wednesday’s Turkish Economic Plan that along with the ECB policy meeting, US CPI, EU emergency Brexit Summit and FOMC minutes forms part of what is being dubbed ‘super Wednesday’. Conversely, the Zar continues to outperform as the Rand got another ratings agency boost when S&amp;P predicted that SA will push forward with structural reforms after elections and gave no inference that it is contemplating a cut to the outlook or credit standing. Usd/Zar inched closer to 14.0000 at 14.0100 before consolidating ahead of the round number.</p>",

Analysts at HSBC believe that the Chinese economy has bottomed, and growth will pick-up in the coming months as the private sector feels the effects from corporate tax cuts. Over in Europe, stocks nursed some of the losses seen at the open after jitters from the US’ release of prelim tariffs on USD 11bln of EU products [Full list available on the headline feed] somewhat waned after sources noted that the legal actions taken against Airbus (-1.5%) subsidies are “greatly exaggerated”, and the EU remains open to dialogue with the US. Furthermore, upside in equities was initially exacerbated amid reports that German Chancellor Merkel is reportedly willing to put a 5yr time limit on the Northern Irish backstop, although equities shed some gains after this was dismissed, but remain in positive territory. Sectors are relatively mixed with no clear outperformer or laggard. In terms of individual stocks, Swiss heavyweight Novartis’ (-9.8% unadj.) Alcon unit (+5.2%) began its first trading day on the front foot and opened above the CHF 46.50-53.50 indicative range at CHF 55.00. Elsewhere, SAP (-2.1%) fell to the foot of the DAX in light of downgrades at HSBC and UBS. Finally, Italy’s Prysmian (-3.9%) extended on losses seen at the open following further failed commission tests.</p><p>FX</p><p>GBP - Sterling leapt towards the top of the G10 table amidst reports that German Chancellor Merkel may be open to a fixed backstop timeframe (5 years touted), which could appease some of those unwilling to back the WA, according to a Brexiteer. Cable cleared the 55 DMA (1.3096) and 1.3100 handle on its way to 1.3121 in response, while Eur/Gbp retreated to 0.8595 from 0.8627 at one stage before a denial by the German Government. Looking ahead, UK PM May’s is in Berlin to see her German counterpart and has a subsequent meeting with French President Macron before Wednesday’s emergency EU Summit. Meanwhile, talks between Tory Cabinet members and the Labour party are ongoing to try and strike a deal, and interim updates remain mixed.</p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie has extended gains to 0.7150 vs its US counterpart and 1.0600 against the Kiwi as commodities continue to rally and overnight data in the form of housing finance confounded expectations to the upside. Aud/Usd is now looking at bullish chart levels including the 100 DMA and a 50% Fib at 0.7142 and 0.7149 respectively to maintain momentum on a closing basis, with decent if not insurmountable option expiries between 0.7150-55 (circa 770 mn) also on the radar. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is trying to tag along and trying to breach 0.6750 ahead of offers said to be sitting at 0.6760.</p><p>JPY - Usd/Jpy has drifted down within a 111.57-24 range and into a relatively heavy expiry zone, as 1.8 bn runs off from 111.20-25 vs 1.7 bn at 111.35-40, with the Yen seeing some safe-haven demand due to renewed US/EU tit-for-tat tariff posturing. Chart-wise, 111.25 also represents the 10 DMA, while resistance ahead of the 112.00 big figure comes via a daily formation around 110.78.</p><p>EUR - The single currency has consolidated yesterday’s clearance of 1.1250 vs the Dollar and is eyeing 1.1280 as the DXY slips a bit further below 97.000 to test support at 96.806 amidst broad declines in Usd/major pairings. However, a thick cluster of option expiries may drag Eur/Usd back down given 5.8 bn rolling off between 1.1245-75, not to mention a further 3.1 bn lower down.</p><p>CAD/NOK - Both benefiting from the ongoing strength in oil prices, and the latter to the extent that a knee-jerk spike in Eur/Nok in wake of weak Norwegian GDP data has already been reversed, with the cross currently straddling 9.6200 vs a high just shy of 9.6500. Meanwhile, the Loonie is pivoting 1.3300 vs its US counterpart and just eclipsed its previous April high.</p><p>EM - More thrills and spills for the Lira, as an initial rebound made on a reduced recount in Istanbul was thwarted by another rejection of the electoral board’s decision by the AKP that is insisting on a full election rerun. Usd/Try back up near 5.6700 vs 5.6425 and 5.6949 at the extremes.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Volatile trade in EU debt after the relatively slow price action seen earlier, as Bunds led advances to fresh intraday highs amidst more EU angst over US tariff threats and then Gilts took over the reins with a swift pull-back on positive sounding Brexit reports before a snap-back on the denial. The 10 year benchmarks have settled down again more recently with Bunds back around par within a 165.11-54 range and Gilts only just a few ticks off-side between 128.27-127.82 parameters after a solid 2028 DMO tap. However, USTs have been more steady and underpinned with the curve fractionally flatter ahead of 3 year supply and as books swell for the multi-tranche ARAMCO offering, with demand said to be particularly strong for the longer maturities.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Another day of gains in the energy complex with WTI and Brent futures trading in proximity to USD 64.50/bbl and USD 71.00/bbl respectively</strong>; although the complex is trading towards the bottom of the days range<strong>.</strong> Developments in Libya remain a key factor in the upside seen recently with analysts at TD noting that “military tensions in Tripoli, Iranian sanctions and difficulties in Venezuela may cause deficits as OPEC+ is reducing supply and US shale activity is flattening — USD 68/bbl WTI in the cards”. That said, analysts at Goldman Sachs, due to lower projected inventories, expect further backwardation and modest upside in oil prices whilst forecasting the WTI/Brent spread to tighten to USD 4.50/bbl from Q4 2019 onwards. GS also raised its Q2 2019 Brent forecast to USD 72.50/bbl (Prev. USD 65.00/bbl) and maintained its USD 60.00/bbl 2020 forecast. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need to extend the OPEC+ output deal if the market is forecast to be balanced by H2, which his Saudi counterpart previously said was only 70-80mln barrel away. Elsewhere, metals are benefitting from the recent pullback in the Buck, with gold also profiting from recent flows into the yellow metal ahead of tomorrow’s risk-filled day. Copper gained amid continued strength in Chinese commodity prices in which Dalian iron ore futures gained for a 7th consecutive session amid tightening supply. Finally, Platinum caught a bid as markets speculate the impact of labour strikes in South Africa, which saw the metal break through key resistance levels whilst also triggering CTA short covering, according to TD.</p><p>Russian Energy Minister Novak says there is no need to extend oil production deal if the market is forecast to be balanced in H2, adds that a decision on oil deal will be made in June. (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs expects further backwardation and modest upside in the energy complex due to lower projected inventories. Q2 2019 forecast raised to USD 72.50/bbl (Prev.

Analysts at HSBC believe that the Chinese economy has bottomed, and growth will pick-up in the coming months as the private sector feels the effects from corporate tax cuts. Over in Europe, stocks nursed some of the losses seen at the open after jitters from the US’ release of prelim tariffs on USD 11bln of EU products [Full list available on the headline feed] somewhat waned after sources noted that the legal actions taken against Airbus (-1.9%) subsidies are “greatly exaggerated”, and the EU remains open to dialogue with the US. Furthermore, upside in equities was initially exacerbated amid reports that German Chancellor Merkel is reportedly willing to put a 5yr time limit on the Northern Irish backstop, although equities shed some gains after this was dismissed, but remain in positive territory. Sectors are relatively mixed with no clear outperformer or laggard. In terms of individual stocks, Swiss heavyweight Novartis’ (-10% unadj.) Alcon unit (+4.9%) began its first trading day on the front foot and opened above the CHF 46.50-53.50 indicative range at CHF 55.00. Elsewhere, SAP (-2.3%) fell to the foot of the DAX in light of downgrades at HSBC and UBS. Finally, Italy’s Prysmian (-4.0%) extended on losses seen at the open following further failed commission tests.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - Sterling leapt towards the top of the G10 table amidst reports that German Chancellor Merkel may be open to a fixed backstop timeframe (5 years touted), which could appease some of those unwilling to back the WA, according to a Brexiteer. Cable cleared the 55 DMA (1.3096) and 1.3100 handle on its way to 1.3121 in response, while Eur/Gbp retreated to 0.8595 from 0.8627 at one stage before a denial by the German Government. Looking ahead, UK PM May’s is in Berlin to see her German counterpart and has a subsequent meeting with French President Macron before Wednesday’s emergency EU Summit. Meanwhile, talks between Tory Cabinet members and the Labour party are ongoing to try and strike a deal, and interim updates remain mixed.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - The Aussie has extended gains to 0.7150 vs its US counterpart and 1.0600 against the Kiwi as commodities continue to rally and overnight data in the form of housing finance confounded expectations to the upside. Aud/Usd is now looking at bullish chart levels including the 100 DMA and a 50% Fib at 0.7142 and 0.7149 respectively to maintain momentum on a closing basis, with decent if not insurmountable option expiries between 0.7150-55 (circa 770 mn) also on the radar. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is trying to tag along and trying to breach 0.6750 ahead of offers said to be sitting at 0.6760.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong> - Usd/Jpy has drifted down within a 111.57-24 range and into a relatively heavy expiry zone, as 1.8 bn runs off from 111.20-25 vs 1.7 bn at 111.35-40, with the Yen seeing some safe-haven demand due to renewed US/EU tit-for-tat tariff posturing. Chart-wise, 111.25 also represents the 10 DMA, while resistance ahead of the 112.00 big figure comes via a daily formation around 110.78.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong> - The single currency has consolidated yesterday’s clearance of 1.1250 vs the Dollar and is eyeing 1.1280 as the DXY slips a bit further below 97.000 to test support at 96.806 amidst broad declines in Usd/major pairings. However, a thick cluster of option expiries may drag Eur/Usd back down given 5.8 bn rolling off between 1.1245-75, not to mention a further 3.1 bn lower down.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK</strong> - Both benefiting from the ongoing strength in oil prices, and the latter to the extent that a knee-jerk spike in Eur/Nok in wake of weak Norwegian GDP data has already been reversed, with the cross currently straddling 9.6200 vs a high just shy of 9.6500. Meanwhile, the Loonie is pivoting 1.3300 vs its US counterpart and just eclipsed its previous April high.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - More thrills and spills for the Lira, as an initial rebound made on a reduced recount in Istanbul was thwarted by another rejection of the electoral board’s decision by the AKP that is insisting on a full election rerun. Usd/Try back up near 5.6700 vs 5.6425 and 5.6949 at the extremes.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Volatile trade in EU debt after the relatively slow price action seen earlier, as <strong>Bunds</strong> led advances to fresh intraday highs amidst more EU angst over US tariff threats and then <strong>Gilts</strong> took over the reins with a swift pull-back on positive sounding Brexit reports before a snap-back on the denial. The <strong>10 year benchmarks</strong> have settled down again more recently with Bunds back around par within a 165.11-54 range and Gilts only just a few ticks off-side between 128.27-127.82 parameters after a solid 2028 DMO tap. However, <strong>USTs</strong> have been more steady and underpinned with the curve fractionally flatter ahead of 3 year supply and as books swell for the multi-tranche ARAMCO offering, with demand said to be particularly strong for the longer maturities.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Another day of gains in the energy complex with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures trading north of USD 64.50/bbl and USD 71.00/bbl respectively. Developments in Libya remain a key factor in the upside seen recently with analysts at TD noting that “military tensions in Tripoli, Iranian sanctions and difficulties in Venezuela may cause deficits as OPEC+ is reducing supply and US shale activity is flattening — USD 68/bbl WTI in the cards”. That said, analysts at Goldman Sachs, due to lower projected inventories, expect further backwardation and modest upside in oil prices whilst forecasting the WTI/Brent spread to tighten to USD 4.50/bbl from Q4 2019 onwards. GS also raised its Q2 2019 Brent forecast to USD 72.50/bbl (Prev. USD 65.00/bbl) and maintained its USD 60.00/bbl 2020 forecast. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need to extend the OPEC+ output deal if the market is forecast to be balanced by H2, which his Saudi counterpart previously said was only 70-80mln barrel away. Elsewhere, metals are benefitting from the recent pullback in the Buck, with <strong>gold</strong> also profiting from recent flows into the yellow metal ahead of tomorrow’s risk-filled day. <strong>Copper</strong> gained amid continued strength in Chinese commodity prices in which Dalian <strong>iron</strong> ore futures gained for a 7th consecutive session amid tightening supply. Finally, <strong>Platinum</strong> caught a bid as markets speculate the impact of labour strikes in South Africa, which saw the metal break through key resistance levels whilst also triggering CTA short covering, according to TD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Meanwhile, the Loonie is pivoting 1.3300 vs its US counterpart and just eclipsed its previous April high.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>More thrills and spills for the Lira, as an initial rebound made on a reduced recount in Istanbul was thwarted by another rejection of the electoral board’s decision by the AKP that is insisting on a full election rerun. Usd/Try back up near 5.6700 vs 5.6425 and 5.6949 at the extremes.</p>",

Some have also suggested ongoing tensions with Iran and potential Saudi resentment after the US banned 16 Saudi nations from entering the US for involvement in the Khashoggi killing, were among other factors adding to the bias upside for oil.

However, over the course of the session, the complex gradually eased, with some citing chunky supply this week out of the US Treasury, as well as the corporate slate (books on Aramco's USD 10bln M&amp;A bonds are said to be above USD 60bln). Lower volatility in equities and generally stable S&amp;P also left little need for the haven, while some also cited increased chatter about the reflation trade, too. Some suggest that the rate cut pricing in Fed funds might be a function of the Fed's independence under threat (Board nominee Moore has called for rate cuts recently, as has NEC director Kudlow), however, with optimism that a US/China trade deal can help boost global growth, and stabilising metrics in China too (which can feed through into Europe), there are certainly questions about the need for immediately looser policy. Ahead of FOMC minutes this week, money markets price under 50% chance of a rate cut in 2019 (vs over 50% at the end of last week). Major curve spreads were mixed at settlement. US T-note futures (M9) settled 4+ ticks lower at 123-14+.</p><p>US judge issued an injunction against President Trump administration's policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico. (Newswires)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with a cautious tone following a similar performance from the major indices on Wall St amid tentativeness ahead of upcoming earnings season and this week’s central bank activity including FOMC Minutes and ECB policy meeting. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are subdued but with losses in Australia stemmed by strength in the energy sector as the escalating conflict in Libya lifts oil prices, while Tokyo sentiment has succumbed to detrimental currency flows. However, the region is not without its success stories with Crown Resorts surging over 20% after it announced it was in confidential discussions regarding a takeover approach by Wynn Resorts and with Sony gaining more than 6% on news Third Point was building an activist stake in the Co. and called for a review on ownership of several divisions. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are somewhat choppy with the region lacking any firm drivers and as trade-related news begins to quieten down, while the PBoC also continued to refrain from open market operations.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains softer and tests the 97.00 level to the downside as its major counterparts hold on to the prior day’s gains, with EUR/USD in the midst of a cluster of option expiries between 1.1250-1.1275 with a total value of over EUR 4.5bln and with GBP/USD mildly underpinned after both Houses of Parliament approved the Withdrawal Bill to extend Article 50 and avert the UK crashing out without a deal on April 12th. Looking ahead, UK ministers are to resume Brexit discussions with the opposition Labour Party today in attempt to solve the deadlock although the party has suggested that the government has been unwilling to budge in talks so far, while the EU want the UK to approve the Brexit deal this week or face a long delay and will consider a 9-month or 12-month extension if a withdrawal deal isn't approved by Friday. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are somewhat pressured as the cautious risk tone spur flows into safe-haven JPY, while better than expected Australian Home Loans and recent strength in commodities provides a base for antipodean currencies.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid an indecisive risk tone and with participants awaiting a 5yr auction later, as well as Saudi Aramco’s USD 10bln bond offering which was more than 7x oversubscribed.</p>",
