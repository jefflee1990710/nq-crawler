Following this, Trump took the decision to raise tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, and threatened to also tariff the remaining USD 325bln of Chinese goods at a rate of 25%; Trump this week scaled back his threat on the remaining Chinese goods to a rate of 10% versus the touted level in May of 25%. In response, China set import tariffs against over 5000 US products (USD 60bln) at rates ranging from 5% to 25%, thus ending the truce agreed at the November G20 summit. Since the tariff hikes, very little, if any, progress has been made between the two nations and thus the future path of negotiations may hinge on the weekend meeting. Expectations for a major breakthrough are relatively limited with US Commerce Secretary Ross recently remarking that striking a ‘definitive deal’ on a trade agreement that will amount to thousands of pages on the side-lines of a meeting would be highly unlikely. Instead, investors are looking at whether the two leaders can agree to a ceasefire, which will allow respective teams to iron out a deal. These expectations were underscored by an SCMP article indicating that such an agreement was already in place, according to sources; something which was later rebutted by China. Even if China and US are able to enforce a truce, Capital Economics questions the longevity of any such agreement given the demands the US is placing on China to change it industrial policy and alleged IP theft, something which China thus far has refused to do. The gulf in demands between the two parties was highlighted by a WSJ piece on Thursday, which revealed China’s three demands for the US in order to settle the trade dispute: 1) Lift ban on Huawei, 2) Remove punitive tariffs, 3) Drop efforts to get China to increase purchases of US exports; all of which are likely to be met with a frosty response by the US administration. Therefore, any optimism surrounding a trade truce could prove to be short-lived and as such, Capital Economics “think it more likely than not that 25% tariffs will be applied to all Chinese imports by early next year and that China will retaliate with tariffs and non-tariff measures”. Such a move could deal a further blow to markets as the trade overhang continues to hamper global growth prospects and pose further concerns for central bankers, some of which, have limited room to the downside to combat such negative market forces. Additionally, further speculation will continue to mount over whether or not USD/CNY will breach 7.00 to the upside, a move which could trigger capital outflows of China and draw the ire of the White House amid accusations of currency manipulation.</p><p><strong>* OPEC:</strong> OPEC+ is widely expected to rollover the existing 1.2mln BPD supply curb pact at the meetings in Vienna next week; a bullish outcome would be the announcement of deeper than existing cuts, and a bearish being a reduction/conclusion of cuts. The G20 summit is a tail risk due to the possibility, albeit slim, of a large shift in trade tensions moving demand expectations in either direction. Goldman Sachs highlights the uncertainty in the oil market, “driven by both an uncertain macro outlook and debatable Iran/Venezuela/US production,” which the bank believes will cause the group to walk the path of least resistance (a rollover with no change to current quotas). In regard to individual members, Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, has expressed its preference for the extensions leading up to the event, RBC’s analysts expect it to announce at the meeting its willingness to “swing both ways” to balance the market, and given the country’s need for higher fiscal revenues, analysts expect it to lean towards further cuts rather than the opposite, but the risk of upsetting US President Trump with too high oil prices will limit excessive cuts. The wildcard to the meeting is external member Russia, where comments from officials have been less decisive on committing to the extension. Russian oil corporates have been more outright in their comments, expressing opposition to the extension, too. RBC suggests that ultimately Russia will not dissent, mainly due to President Putin beginning to face deteriorating economic conditions domestically, where an upset with OPEC allies would jeopardise his power in the cartel in addition to the benefits Russia has gained from new, wide-ranging trade deals.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> US Special Representative on Iran Hook said that Iran has rejected diplomacy too many times and that sanctions will be imposed on any illicit purchase of Iranian oil. Hook went on, saying If the US doesn’t prevent Iran from laying deep roots in Yemen, Iran will be in a position to close the Strait of Hormuz. In regard to Washington’s ever growing economic grip on Iran, Hook said the US is on track to deny Iran USD 50bln in oil revenue alone, and will intensify sanctions on Iran until it decides to be a normal state. Elsewhere, an Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman said Iran's next move regarding the Nuclear deal depends on the EU's practical measures (Iran had previously said it requires the EU to continue providing revenue for oil), and following ongoing nuclear deal talks, an Iranian Envoy said the meeting was a step forwards, but it was not enough to change Tehran's stance on the deal's limit, indicating it would continue growing its stocks of enriched uranium. Meanwhile, an EU Statement says Iran nuclear deal remains key element of global nuclear non-proliferation, special EU channel to allow trad with Iran and circumvent US sanctions is now operational</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.96 LOWER AT USD 58.47; BRENT (Q9, EXPIRES) SETTLES UNCHANGED AT USD 66.55:</strong> The energy complex has been consolidating in a narrow range to end the week ahead of the G20 summit and OPEC+ meeting next week. Citi’s energy analysts note how Friday has been a day of moderate-volume book squaring in anticipation of the events and end of month/quarter/H1 flows, in addition,&nbsp; “August Brent futures, July heating oil, and July RBOB gasoline futures all expire today, adding a more routine element of book squaring to the trade.” Ahead of the Vienna OPEC+ meeting the WSJ reported that OPEC are set to extend the supply cuts in H2, with some set to argue for deeper cuts, but key-member Saudi is unlikely to back such a move. Additionally, with eyes on Russia given its previous scepticism to the extensions, Russian Energy Minister Novak said the Kremlin has consolidated the position with Russian oil companies concerning the cuts, who previously were opposed to them, but did not specify what they agreed; however, there is wide consensus that Russia will, more likely than not, not dissent from OPEC. The Baker Hughes US rig count for the latest week recorded oil rigs +4 at 793, nat gas rigs -4 at 173, leaving total rigs unchanged at 967. In pre-settlement trade, the EU said its vehicle to circumvent US sanctions was ready to go, leading to downside for WTI, with traders rationalising that the vehicle to allow the buying of Iranian crude would lessen demand for US WTI.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 1 TICKS HIGHER AT 127-31: </strong>Anticipation around the meeting between President Trump and Xi overnight has kept trading cautious on Friday, which was also the last trading day before month/quarter/H1 end. The Treasury curve was mixed, but yields only deviated by around +/- 1bps at settlement, with major curve spreads little changed.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.6% AT 2941, NASDAQ-100 0.2% AT 7671, DOW JONES 0.3% AT 26596.</strong> SECTORS: S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; 1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; 1.3%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; 1%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Financials were outperforming on Friday following all the major US banks having their capital spending plans approved by the Fed on the back of successful stress tests. Apple (AAPL) weighed on indices after its Chief Designer announced his departure. Nike (NKE) drifted lower on the back of its earnings, where it beat on revenue but missed on EPS, in addition to some lacklustre revenue guidance for the next quarter. Constellation Brands (STZ) had a star reaching earnings report, topping both EPS and revenue estimates as well as guidance expectations. Raytheon (RTN) underperformed as investor Daniel Loeb joined with Bill Ackman to oppose the United Technologies (UTX) merger. Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG) opened higher on an upgrade at Goldman, whilst Biogen (BIIB) opened lower with gratitude to a downgrade at Piper Jaffray.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP - DXY: </strong>The broad Dollar and Index kicked the week off holding onto most of last week’s Fed-induced losses. DXY is poised to end the EU session little changed from Sunday’s open and in a relatively narrow range, having visited a weekly low of 95.84 and a high of 96.39. The index rebounded from post-FOMC lows amid a tag-team of Fed Chair Powell and dissenter Bullard who tempered expectations for a 50bps cut as it seems too aggressive. The upside however abated as many bank models pointed to USD selling heading into month/quarter/HY end whilst G20 expectation remain for a calming of tensions (for now) between US and China. In terms of key tech levels heading into the G20, the DXY sees its 200 WMA to the downside at 95.97 whilst to the upside, the 50 WMA resides at 96.37.</p><p><strong>* EUR, GBP:</strong> The Single Currency is set to end the EU week with marginal gains, albeit sub-1.14 having traded in a 1.1344-1.1412 weekly band vs the Dollar. EUR/USD mostly traded at the whim of the Buck tested its 200 DMA (1.1344) to the downside in wake of Powell and Bullard’s rate cut expectation tempering. The EUR also failed to materialise on gains seen following the encouraging German prelim inflation data, partially due to restricting hefty option expiries on the day. Elsewhere, the Pound is poised to end the session on the backfoot amid Brexit/political uncertainty coupled with month-end EUR/GBP demand. Cable looks to close EU trade just above the 1.2700 level after little reaction to in-line GDP and having traded within a 1.2661-2783 band.</p><p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD:</strong> A strong weekly performance by the risk currencies vs the Buck and all poised to end the EU week on a firmer footing. Firstly, the Aussie kicked the week off with gains amid comments from RBA Governor Lowe took a less dovish stance and noted that rate cuts will be less effective if other Central Banks are also in easing mode and has since gained further ground against the Dollar, partly aided by an improvement in China industrial profits. The AUD is now gearing up for the G20 summit to which it’ll be one of the more sensitive G10s given its exposure to China. Furthermore, next week sees the latest RBA rate decision with analysts split on whether the CB will cut or hold, whilst money markets are pricing an 80% chance of a June cut to 1.00%. The Kiwi is set to notch a fifth day of gains, aided partly by the RBNZ (to recap, an easing bias was maintained but also noted two contradictory factors were highlighted alongside subdued domestic growth and downside risks to inflation and employment targets relative to the previous meeting in May), but a bulk of the momentum was seen earlier in the week amid the release of trade balance metrics which topped expectations. NZD/USD set to close the EU session above its 200 DMA (0.6709) having already breached its 100 DMA/50WMA (0.6696/0.6699). Finally, the CAD, also on the front-foot vs the USD as USD/CAD is set to the end week near the bottom of a 1.3068-3261 band, partially aided by the rebound in oil whilst the above forecast GDP figures also provided the Loonie some impetus to gain more ground against the Greenback.</p><p><strong>* JPY, CHF:</strong> The safe haven FX look to end the week mixed with the Yen closer to the top of a weekly 106.78-108.16, albeit the bulk of the action was inspired by the rebound in the Buck post-Powell/Bullard before a relatively tentative end to the trading week ahead of the G20 summit. Meanwhile, the Franc is set to close the session largely unchanged for the week and at the middle of a 0.9700-9810 range.</p>",

Citi’s energy analysts note how Friday has been a day of moderate-volume book squaring in anticipation of the events and end of month/quarter/H1 flows, in addition, “August Brent futures, July heating oil, and July RBOB gasoline futures all expire today, adding a more routine element of book squaring to the trade.” Ahead of the Vienna OPEC+ meeting the WSJ reported that OPEC are set to extend the supply cuts in H2, with some set to argue for deeper cuts, but key-member Saudi is unlikely to back such a move. Additionally, with eyes on Russia given its previous scepticism to the extensions, Russian Energy Minister Novak said the Kremlin has consolidated the position with Russian oil companies concerning the cuts, who previously were opposed to them, but did not specify what they agreed; however, there is wide consensus that Russia will, more likely than not, not dissent from OPEC. The Baker Hughes US rig count for the latest week recorded oil rigs +4 at 793, nat gas rigs -4 at 173, leaving total rigs unchanged at 967. In pre-settlement trade, the EU said its vehicle to circumvent US sanctions was ready to go, leading to downside for WTI, with traders rationalising that the vehicle to allow the buying of Iranian crude would lessen demand for US WTI.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index kicked the week off holding onto most of last week’s Fed-induced losses. DXY is poised to end the EU session little changed from Sunday’s open and in a relatively narrow range, having visited a weekly low of 95.84 and a high of 96.39. The index rebounded from post-FOMC lows amid a tag-team of Fed Chair Powell and dissenter Bullard who tempered expectations for a 50bps cut as it seems too aggressive. The upside however abated as many bank models pointed to USD selling heading into month/quarter/HY end whilst G20 expectation remain for a calming of tensions (for now) between US and China. In terms of key tech levels heading into the G20, the DXY sees its 200 WMA to the downside at 95.97 whilst to the upside, the 50 WMA resides at 96.37.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>The Single Currency is set to end the EU week with marginal gains, albeit sub-1.14 having traded in a 1.1344-1.1412 weekly band vs the Dollar. EUR/USD mostly traded at the whim of the Buck tested its 200 DMA (1.1344) to the downside in wake of Powell and Bullard’s rate cut expectation tempering. The EUR also failed to materialise on gains seen following the encouraging German prelim inflation data, partially due to restricting hefty option expiries on the day. Elsewhere, the Pound is poised to end the session on the backfoot amid Brexit/political uncertainty coupled with month-end EUR/GBP demand. Cable looks to close EU trade just above the 1.2700 level after little reaction to in-line GDP and having traded within a 1.2661-2783 band.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>A strong weekly performance by the risk currencies vs the Buck and all poised to end the EU week on a firmer footing. Firstly, the Aussie kicked the week off with gains amid comments from RBA Governor Lowe took a less dovish stance and noted that rate cuts will be less effective if other Central Banks are also in easing mode and has since gained further ground against the Dollar, partly aided by an improvement in China industrial profits. The AUD is now gearing up for the G20 summit to which it’ll be one of the more sensitive G10s given its exposure to China. Furthermore, next week sees the latest RBA rate decision with analysts split on whether the CB will cut or hold, whilst money markets are pricing an 80% chance of a June cut to 1.00%. The Kiwi is set to notch a fifth day of gains, aided partly by the RBNZ (to recap, an easing bias was maintained but also noted two contradictory factors were highlighted alongside subdued domestic growth and downside risks to inflation and employment targets relative to the previous meeting in May), but a bulk of the momentum was seen earlier in the week amid the release of trade balance metrics which topped expectations. NZD/USD set to close the EU session above its 200 DMA (0.6709) having already breached its 100 DMA/50WMA (0.6696/0.6699). Finally, the CAD, also on the front-foot vs the USD as USD/CAD is set to the end week near the bottom of a 1.3068-3261 band, partially aided by the rebound in oil whilst the above forecast GDP figures also provided the Loonie some impetus to gain more ground against the Greenback.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The safe haven FX look to end the week mixed with the Yen closer to the top of a weekly 106.78-108.16, albeit the bulk of the action was inspired by the rebound in the Buck post-Powell/Bullard before a relatively tentative end to the trading week ahead of the G20 summit. Meanwhile, the Franc is set to close the session largely unchanged for the week and at the middle of a 0.9700-9810 range.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, CNH</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index remain in a relatively confined 96.05-25 range as markets gear up for tomorrow’s US-Sino showdown. US President Trump said that he believes the meeting with his Chinese counterpart (at 0330BST tomorrow) will be “productive at minimum”. The comments somewhat reaffirmed market expectations for a restart in talks, but no breakthrough. The index currently hovers closer to the bottom of the intraday range ahead of the psychological 96.00 and its 200 WMA at 95.97, while to the upside, technicians will be eyeing resistance at 96.37 (50 WMA). Meanwhile, US Core PCE and comments from Fed’s Daly are unlikely to sway the Buck ahead of the weekend’s risk event. In a similar vein, CNH is caged within a tight 6.86-88 range vs Greenback but is ultimately flat, having briefly dipped below its 50 DMA at 6.8675.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP, NZD, AUD, JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>All largely firmer from a marginally softer USD, albeit the EUR also feels tailwind from touted month-end EUR/GBP buying, which aided the pair climb to levels last seen in January. EUR was little moved by the release of overall encouraging inflation data in which the core and super-core figures topped estimates while the headline matched expectations. EUR/USD remains near the top of a 1.1360-90 intraday band with around 1bln in options scattered around strikes 1.1375-85. Meanwhile, the GBP is benefiting slightly less from a softer USD amid the aforementioned EUR/GBP buying as Cable remains within a tight band under 1.2700. Elsewhere the AUD and NZD have similarly jumped on the back of a softer Buck and over close to HODs of 0.7017 and 0.6710 respectively, albeit off best levels. Finally, the safe heaven FX follow suit from the tentative tone in the FX market, although positioning before the end of the trading day may sway the currencies. USD/JPY hovers just above the near the bottom of a 107.57-83 range with 2.1bln in options expiring at 107.50 at today’s NY cut.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOK, SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Swedish Crown has pared back recent losses vs. the EUR after dismal retail sales extended the pair’s intraday upper bound to 10.5850, albeit the SEK has since pared back those losses and trades flat on the day thus far. Meanwhile, the NOK was little fazed by the regional unemployment figures and fares slightly worse but ultimately on the back of softer energy prices.&nbsp;</p>",

Weak ESI out of the Eurozone provided some impetus to the FI complex, and gains extended into the US open, after more woes at Boeing saw equity futures come under pressure. A WSJ article which was negative on trade developments allowed the upside to continue. Pending home sales data and hawkish remarks from Kudlow on trade allowed the bulls to continue to reign. The US 7-year auction stopped through the screens by 0.2bps, and cover improved though remained beneath the six auction average. The direct bid was strong, and the indirect bid subsequently eased a touch. The complex was near highs at settlement.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were subdued amid book squaring heading into the end of H1 and after the firm rebound in June, with participants also tentative as focus remained on the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting at the G20. ASX 200 (-0.5%) was led lower by mining names with BHP pressured as it is expected to pay AUD 250mln as settlement in the royalty dispute with Western Australia, although downside for the broader market was limited by outperformance in tech and financials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) also suffered losses in the commodity-related sectors and with exporters weighed by detrimental flows into the currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) weakened amid continued PBoC inaction and as trade uncertainty remained rife heading into the US-China showdown at the G20. Recent reports suggested Chinese President Xi intends to present a set of terms to settle the trade dispute and that Beijing insists the US remove the Huawei ban, lift all punitive tariffs and drop efforts to get China to buy even more US exports, which is unlikely to bode well with the US side and reduces the chances of a breakthrough in talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the upside in their US counterparts with prices lifted by safe-haven flows and amid the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 720bln of government bonds in the belly to super-long end.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are subdued amid book squaring heading into the end of H1 and after the firm rebound in June, with participants also tentative as focus remains on the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting at the G20. ASX 200 (-0.3%) is led lower by mining names with BHP pressured amid reports it is expected to pay AUD 250mln as settlement in the royalty dispute with Western Australia, but with downside in the broader market limited by outperformance in tech and financials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) is also dampened by softness in the commodity-related sectors and with exporters weighed by detrimental flows into the currency. Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) are weaker after continued PBoC inaction and as trade uncertainty remains rife heading into the US-China showdown at the G20. Recent reports suggested Chinese President Xi intends to present a set of terms to settle the trade dispute and that Beijing insists the US remove the Huawei ban, lift all punitive tariffs and drop efforts to get China to buy even more US exports, which is unlikely to bode well with the US side and reduces the chances of a breakthrough at the meeting.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is uneventful across the board with the DXY little changed on the session and as its major counterparts also trade rangebound with EUR/USD steady after support around its 200DMA held in yesterday’s session, while GBP/USD is lacklustre following a recent failed attempt to reclaim the 1.2700 handle. In terms of news from the leadership race, front runner Boris Johnson is preparing an emergency budget for a no-deal which includes aggressive tax cuts as well as an overhaul of stamp duties and offered Home Secretary Javid the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Elsewhere, the risk averse tone has pressured USD/JPY and spurred a mild pullback for antipodeans leading to a compromise of the 0.7000 and 0.6700 levels for AUD/USD and NZD/USD respectively.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs track the upside in their US counterparts with domestic prices lifted by safe-haven flows and amid the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 720bln of government bonds in the belly to super-long end.&nbsp;</p>",

There were also comments from US NEC Director Kudlow that there are no preconditions in trade talks with China, while he added that the US may move ahead with additional tariffs on Chinese products and nothing was agreed upon before the Trump-Xi meeting. (Politico/Fox News)</p><p>Senior US official said President Trump's decision on whether to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods is contingent on the Xi meeting, with nothing agreed ahead of time and that it is unlikely the US would agree to lift the Huawei restrictions. Furthermore, there were reports that the US will not give China a 'balanced' trade deal due to past transgressions made by China, although a truce is possible even if there is no agreement on the issues, while the sources added that it is not clear how long a truce would last as President Trump likes deadline pressure and USTR Lighthizer doesn't. (Newswires/CNBC)</p><p>Chinese President Xi is intending on presenting US President Trump with a set of terms that the US needs to meet before Beijing will be prepared to settle the trade dispute, according to reports citing a Chinese Official. Beijing is said to be insisting that the US remove its ban on tech sales to Huawei, lift all punitive tariffs and drop efforts to get China to buy even more US exports. However, reports noted that despite these preconditions, President Xi is not anticipated to undertake a confrontational stance with US President Trump and will outline his visions as to the optimal bilateral relations between the two countries. (Newswires)</p><p>China's MOFCOM urged the US to immediately cancel sanctions on Chinese firms including Huawei and stated that it opposes US abuse of export control, while it is also to consider placing firms on an unreliable list if they implement discriminatory measures on Chinese entities and also firms that threaten the national security of China. In related news, China MOFCOM spokesman Geng stated they are not aware of the SCMP report regarding a tentative trade deal.
