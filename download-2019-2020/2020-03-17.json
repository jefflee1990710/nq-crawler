There was speculation out of the gate that the Fed would step into the commercial paper market to continue addressing the funding stresses; the Fed made the announcement official in morning trade. The risk complex was also supported by governments around the world continuing to pledge huge amounts of fiscal support for companies and individuals to get through the crisis -- in the US, the package could be worth between USD 850bln and USD 1.2trln, according to multiple sourced reports (Mnuchin himself suggested around USD 1trln). Equities ramped after a press conference with President Trump, where the Treasury Secretary suggested that direct check payments (of around USD 1,000 in the next two weeks) to Americans was on the cards. SPX +6.0% at 2535, NDX +6.5% at 7474, DJIA +5.2% at 21237.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened with yields up over 11bps in the front of the curve, and up over 30bps in the long-end. Analysts said the moves were a result of an equity rebound after steep declines on Monday. However, the key was the Fed stepping in to support the commercial paper market, which analysts aid was a key source of funding stress, and havens saw outflows as a result. The haven bid was deflated as governments came along with massive stimulus measures and guaranteeing loans to try and backstop the potential downside from the coronavirus. There was even some talk about profit-taking in the long-end after some very big moves, of late. US T-note futures settle 2 points lower at 136-02.</p>",

Supply:<strong> </strong>Germany.</li></ul><h2>MARKET WRAP:</h2><p><strong>After a grim session on Monday, equities rebounded, </strong>though trade was extremely choppy, particularly after the open as pre-market retail sales data highlighted that the economy may have been facing some headwinds even before the virus began spreading, while industrial and manufacturing production data was mixed. There was speculation out of the gate that the Fed would step into the commercial paper market to continue addressing the funding stresses; the Fed made the announcement official in morning trade. The risk complex was also supported by governments around the world continuing to pledge huge amounts of fiscal support for companies and individuals to get through the crisis -- in the US, the package could be worth between USD 850bln and USD 1.2trln, according to multiple sourced reports (Mnuchin himself suggested around USD 1trln). Equities ramped after a press conference with President Trump, where the Treasury Secretary suggested that direct check payments (of around USD 1,000 in the next two weeks) to Americans was on the cards. Desks also noted that the VIX remains extremely elevated, although analysts at Goldman Sachs pointed out that intra-day volatility has been declining; the bank believes that the swings into the close suggest that market participants view end-of-day price moves as fundamentally unjustified, and the moves are perhaps being exacerbated by equity derivatives, ETFs, and fund rebalancing. Meanwhile, the configuration of gains today saw utilities leading the charge higher (despite US yields seeing chunky rises -- desks note the defensive nature of the sector, the potential for high dividend growth, while there are even some talking about value in the sector), followed by staples as consumers stockpile essentials. Energy was the laggard, the only sector in the red, taking its cue from the crude complex.</p><h2>COVID-19:</h2><p><strong>US FISCAL MEASURES:</strong> The Trump administration is considering an economic stimulus package between USD 850bln to 1.2trln (depending on which sources you believe) to help support the economy manage the outbreak. The Administration is also mulling directly sending Americans checks to ensure consumers have cash to get through the worst of the crisis (potentially a USD 250bln measure). It also increased the amount of tax payments that can be deferred by business (up to USD 10mln), and for individuals can defer tax payments up to USD 1mln for 90 days, both interest and penalty-free. Loans to SME would account for USD 300bln of stimulus, and there would be USD 200bln allocated for unspecified stabilisation measures. The Treasury Secretary also said that he was aiming that markets remain open, though he did suggest that shorter trading hours may be needed at some point. Senate Majority Leader McConnell says it is too early to say if he supports elements of the White House coronavirus stimulus plan.</p><p><strong>UK FISCAL MEASURES:</strong> The Government announced measures totaling GBP 330bln (of government backed loans), or 15% of GDP, to support the economy through coronavirus; \"If demand is greater than that, will provide as much as capacity as is required,\" the chancellor said. The funds will be made available via a new lending facility for large firms with BOE, and for SMEs through an extension of a loan scheme announced last week. The Chancellor said there would also be a 12-month business rate holiday for all firms in retail, leisure and hospitality sectors; cash grants of up to GBP 25k per qualified business. There will also be cash grants for small businesses, and the size was increased. For consumers, there will be a three-month mortgage holiday for homeowners.</p><p><strong>NEW YORK:</strong> Mayor de Blasio says he is “absolutely considering” shelter in place order for New York City residents just like the one instituted in California’s Bay Area on Monday, according to CNN. This would effectively put NY in lockdown. EUROPEAN RESPONSE: EU Leaders agree to close borders to prevent virus spread for a period of 30-days. Ministers also discussed joint debt issuance, according to German Chancellor Merkel, though no conclusion was reached; joint debt issuance has been a thorny subject for Germany, and even discussing the measure was interpreted as a positive by participants. EU Commission's Von der Leyen says EU state aid rules will be flexible so governments can support their companies.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS:</h2><p><strong>FED COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITY:</strong> The Fed said it will re-establish a commercial paper funding facility (CPFF) to support credit flow, which would provide a liquidity backstop to the market via a special purpose vehicle, which would purchase unsecured and asset-backed paper rated A1/PI as of March 17th directly. Pricing would be based on the then-current 3-month OIS+200bps – a markedly more attractive price for corporates than what current market spreads offer. The central bank noted that the commercial paper market was under \"considerable strain\" in recent sessions due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The facility should eliminate risks in the market and improve companies' ability to maintain employment and investment through the outbreak, the Fed said. The CPFF was last used in the wake of the 2008 GFC.</p><p><strong>FED’S KASHKARI (DOVE, VOTER): </strong>said the Fed hasn’t used all its ammunition and doesn't have an interest of going below zero interest rates, although doesn't rule out the measure either – comments made in a CNBC interview. As calls grow for the Fed to step into the commercial credit markets, Kashkari noted the Fed is watching the space closely. On the approaching slowdown, the Minneapolis Fed President said he believes it will be a “mild one”. Later, Kashkari said the virus outbreak will quickly become an economic crisis for the US, which could quickly become a recession; says it could be a long crisis, adding that the right reaction is to overreact to provide the best outcome.</p><p><strong>FED’S MESTER (HAWK, VOTER): </strong>said that she supported all actions in the emergency FOMC meeting, but not the 100bps rate cut. She argued that lowering interest rates has less of an impact in the current environment, and she had preferred to retain the option of using cuts in the future.</p><p><strong>DISCOUNT WINDOW: </strong>Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), State Street (STT) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have begun tapping the Fed’s, previously stigmatized, Discount Window for funding. The Fed cut the rate it charges to the lending facility by 150bps to 0.25% on Sunday, the upper end of its target FFR, greatly increasing its allure for banks. Fed Governor Quarles has been vocal in the past about taking measures to encourage usage of the facility.</p><p><strong>NY FED OPERATIONS: </strong>The Desk carried out its 14-day Term repo operation, which oversubscribed, accepting USD 45bln in bids (USD 46bln submitted). It then carried out its O/N operation, accepting all USD 142.65bln in bids submitted (USD 500bln offered after upping it from USD 175bln). The GC rate remained above the top-end of the FFR prompting the NY Fed to come in the market for a second O/N offering, as it did on Monday, which tamed the GC rate beneath the 0.10% stop-out rate and saw a much less USD 10.10bln amount in bids submitted.</p><p><strong>ECB: </strong>The ECB allotted EUR 109bln in its new three-month LTRO operation. Elsewhere, the Bundesbank said it has not seen increased cash withdrawals in the past two weeks, according to German press.</p><p><strong>BOC: </strong>Bank of Canada reiterated that it was ready to cut rates further and to deploy other market tools if required, to support growth and keep inflation on target. Regarding Friday’s rate cut, it said Policymakers concluded there could be a considerable benefit to reducing interest rates immediately.</p><p><strong>CBRT:</strong> The Turkish Central Bank opted for an emergency 100bps rate cut ahead of its scheduled meeting on Thursday, bringing the one-week repo rate to 9.75%.&nbsp; Mounting fears over the virus outbreak prompted MPC members to conduct an emergency meeting earlier in the day. The Central Bank noted that the recent Lira weakness is being offset by the slump in oil prices. The statement did, however, note that the “weakening in global trade and measures such as travel restrictions; the disinflationary effect of aggregate demand conditions has increased to some extent.” Although the cautious stance has been maintained, the CBRT “emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.” Furthermore, the Bank unveiled measures including the provision on TRY liquidity, with a rate 150bps below the one-week repo, through repo auctions with maturities up to 91 days. Amid the unsettled financial conditions, the CBRT also stated it will provide banks with as much liquidity as they need, via intraday and standing overnight facilities.</p><p><strong>NBP: </strong>Polish Central Bank cut its key interest rate to 1.0% (Prev. 1.5%) in an emergency move, Lombard rate cut to 1.5% (Prev. 2.5%), Rediscount rate cut to 1.05% (Prev. 1.75%). It also cut its reserve requirement rate on PLN and foreign currency funds held in bank accounts to 0.5% (Prev. 3.5%).</p><h2>EQUITIES:</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> </strong>+6.23% at 2535, NDX +6.46% at 7474, DJIA +5.19% at 21237.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Utilities +13.11%, Cons Stpl +8.39%, Real Estate +6.94%, Technology +6.77%, Materials +6.65%, Health +6.26%, Financials +5.77%, Industrials +4.2%, Cons Disc +4.03%, Communication Svs +3.99%, Energy +0.72%.</p><p><strong>Stock Specifics: </strong>Defensives (XLU, XLP) saw heavy gains today with Ameren (AEE) and Consolidated Edison (ED) leading the utilities, perhaps finding solace from news that Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG) received bankruptcy court approval to use up to USD 23bln (11bln debt, 9bln new equity, 3bln through new shares) in financing after California Governor Newsom withdrew his opposition against the move, as the co. continues its aim to move away from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Staples were led by gains in Church &amp; Dwight (CHD) and Clorox (CLX) given both companies are sellers of cleaning supplies. Clorox (CLX) announced it is producing as much products as possible but urged customers to only purchase what is needed.&nbsp; Health Care (XLV) saw solid gains also, Regeneron (REGN) announced its coronavirus antibody programme has the potential to start human clinical studies by early summer. Baxter (BAX) reported solid earnings, although guidance was weak. Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB), Nordstrom (JWN), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Tiffany (TIF) are the latest to temporarily close its stores in an attempt to limit the spread, while Apple (AAPL) extended the closure of its non-China stores until further notice. FL, LB, JWN and ULTA also withdrew its guidance, as did Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV). Uber (UBER) &amp; Lyft (LYFT) suspended its shared rides on its platform throughout the US and Canada to help prevent the spread. Amazon (AMZN) announced in a tweet it will be suspending shipments other than medical supplies and household staples. On airlines, US President Trump’s administration is reportedly looking at stimulus proposals for the airline sector, according to Washington Post. Southwest Airlines (LUV) withdrew FY20 guidance, while noting its load factor (month to date) was roughly 67%, although in recent days it is heading towards 50%. The airline also will reduce its Available Seat Miles (ASM) by 20% from April to June. Meanwhile, source reports suggested that American Airlines (AAL) is in discussions to borrow billions in new debt and Delta Airlines (DAL) is in talks to raise USD 4bln in new debt. Elsewhere, Dow (DOW) rallied after its CEO announced its demand in China has bounced back in recent weeks. In late trade, reports suggested that Boing (BA) was reportedly seeking \"tens of billions\" in government support.</p><p><strong>BANKS: </strong>US Banking Regulator has repeated the call for banks to use capital and liquidity buffers to support the economy and businesses; regulators are proposing a rule change to make sure bank payouts gradually reduced if buffer breached.</p><h2>CRUDE:</h2><p><strong>CRUDE SETTLEMENT: </strong>WTI (J0) settled USD 1.75 lower at USD 26.95. Brent (K0) settled USD 1.32 lower at USD 28.73/bbl.</p><p><strong>Crude benchmarks reversed earlier gains in line with the session’s evolution of risk appetite. </strong>After a strong selloff on Monday, the benchmarks made gains, alongside equities, in the overnight session before reversing course into US trade. On the supply side, Saudi announced it is now raising its production to 10mln BPD as part of its efforts to ramp up production to 12.3mln BPD in April. Saudi Energy Minister also said that the Kingdom’s sudden increase in crude exports is due to utilizing gas produced by its Fadhili plant to compensate for about 250k BPD of domestic oil production. Elsewhere, Goldman has cut its Q2 Brent forecast to USD 20/bbl (prev. USD 30/bbl); the analysts also forecast US production to fall by over 1mln BPD between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021 – note there is generally a time-lag for producers to respond to shifts in oil prices. Although Total (FP FP) announced on Tuesday that it is adapting its refinery output in France to meet the current demand situation.</p><h2>BONDS</h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: US T-Note futures settle 2 points lower at 136-02.</strong></p><p><strong>TREASURIES: </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened with yields up over 11bps in the front of the curve, and up over 30bps in the long-end. Analysts said the moves were a result of an equity rebound after steep declines on Monday. However, the key was the Fed stepping in to support the commercial paper market, which analysts aid was a key source of funding stress, and havens saw outflows as a result. The haven bid was deflated as governments came along with massive stimulus measures and guaranteeing loans to try and backstop the potential downside from covid. There was even some talk about profit-taking in the long-end after some very big moves, of late.</p><h2>FOREX:</h2><p><strong>FX WRAP: </strong>The dollar surged, driven higher by funding pressures, and ignoring the liquidity ramp being offered by the Fed; the buck now flirts with YTD highs around 99.915, though has not managed to touch it yet. The EUR lost out as the buck gained, given rate differentials moved sharply in favour of the buck (see Treasury wrap above). Outflows from havens and yield differentials also resulted in USDJPY rising to almost touch 108.00. GBP fell to a fresh YTD low also managed to bounce after the government announced a massive programme to support the economy, although at pixel time is still languishing by almost 2%, it remains above 1.20. The Antipodes are heavily lower, despite the bounce in risk sentiment, taking their cues from the mighty buck. Commodity FX (RUB) was weighed as crude prices continued to find fresh YTD lows. The CAD fell to a four-year low, with many desks now expecting further action from the BOC. The TRY and ZAR managed to rise, with the latter eying the SARB meeting on Thursday, where it is expected to cut rates, although any easing is seen as limited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

On the supply side, Saudi announced it is now raising its production to 10mln BPD as part of its efforts to ramp up production to 12.3mln BPD in April. Saudi Energy Minister also said that the Kingdom’s sudden increase in crude exports is due to utilizing gas produced by its Fadhili plant to compensate for about 250k BPD of domestic oil production. Elsewhere, Goldman has cut its Q2 Brent forecast to USD 20/bbl (prev. USD 30/bbl); the analysts also forecast US production to fall by over 1mln BPD between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021 – note there is generally a time-lag for producers to respond to shifts in oil prices. Although Total (FP FP) announced on Tuesday that it is adapting its refinery output in France to meet the current demand situation.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck and index have been bid for the bulk of Tuesday’s EU session in stark contrast to see-saw trade in stocks and bonds alongside several counterpart currencies. Funding and liquidity factors are still driving demand for the Dollar, to the extent that disappointing US retail sales data was largely overlooked amidst reports that more fiscal stimulus is in the offing (as much as Usd850 bn touted). In fact, the DXY even inched higher and closer to February 20’s 2020 high (99.915), at 99.776 when the Fed rolled out a CPFF to specifically target strains in the credit market.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/GBP/CHF/JPY/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>None of the Greenback’s major rivals have been able to evade selling pressure for more than periodic phases, and some hardly at all, with the Euro now underperforming and probing bids ahead of 1.0950 after breaching the 200 DMA (near 1.1100) and digesting a grim ZEW survey. Meanwhile, the Aussie lost grip of the 0.6000 handle awaiting further policy action from the RBA in under 48 hours (repo and maybe even QE) and Cable careered through 1.2200 and 1.2100 on the way to a circa 1.2030 irrespective of an encouraging jobs and earnings update. Similarly, the Franc trod cautiously into Thursday’s SNB quarterly policy review and breached 0.9600 and the Yen reversed from around 105.88 beyond 107.50 following a rise in BoJ ETF buying. Back down under, the Kiwi only gleaned fleeting momentum from a Nzd12.1 bn fiscal support package before retreating to 0.5935 at one stage and its Canadian peer was already under pressure beneath another big figure/psychological level when the BoC issued a statement underlining its willingness to ease further and use other tools if needed to prop up the economy and keep inflation on target. Usd/Cad now approaching 1.4200.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Some respite for the beleaguered Norwegian and Swedish Kronas on the back of a net (but far from consistent) improvement in risk appetite that filtered through to oil and some other commodities, while EM currencies witnessed contrasting fortunes after another spate of emergency rate cuts. The CBRT got today’s ball rolling with 100 bp reductions in the key 1 week repo and accompanying benchmark rates, while slashing the RRR on FX reserves by a whopping 5 full points, and the NBP subsequently followed its CEE3 compatriot, CNB, with a ½ point ease. Eur/Nok has eased back between 11.06020-11.3240 extremes and Eur/Sek was capped just ahead of 11.0000, but Usd/Rub remained elevated above 75.0000 as the Brent/WTI spread converged to less than a Buck, if not altogether and the Mxn and Brl both hit fresh all time lows vs the Usd before reclaiming some lost ground.</p>",

The tone in Asia improved from the open spurring mixed views regarding a potential capitulation after the recent sell-off and some murmurs of a dead-cat bounce, although there were further supportive measures including a NZD 12.1bln economic package from New Zealand and the US House passing a revised</p><p>coronavirus bill, as well as efforts from the Trump administration for an additional measure targeting airlines and small businesses. <strong>ASX 200 (+5.8%)</strong> outperformed after a rebound from support at the 5000 level to recoup some of the prior day’s record losses of 9.7% and eventually post its largest intraday gain since 2008 with miners and financials front running the recovery, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.1%)</strong> fluctuated between gains and losses with sentiment flimsy alongside an indecisive currency. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.9%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%)</strong> were both positive in early trade but then reversed course/trimmed gains as early optimism across the region slightly faded and following further liquidity inaction by the PBoC, although reports have suggested the central bank may still reduce the Loan Prime Rate this week even though it opted to maintain rates in yesterday’s Medium-term Lending Facility. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lower as they tracked the recent selling in USTs but with some of the downside later reversed after prices found a platform around 152.50 and with the BoJ also in the market today under a special operation for JPY 200bln of JGBs with 3yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Major bourses are mixed with Spain’s IBEX (+2.4%) the standout outperformer amid after Spain banned short-selling for a month amid the virus-induced selloff. DAX 30 cash briefly dipped below 8500 before trimming some losses, albeit remain some way off its 9145 session high. CAC (-0.6%) failed to glean much support after AMF regulator’s announcement of a 24hr short-selling ban on 92 stocks vs. Spain’s carpet ban, although France’s measure seems more of a cushion against losses as opposed to a deterrent. Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the risk tone, with energy and material benefitting from the</p><p>overnight rebound in respective complexes. In terms of individual movers. Iliad (+18.0%) tops the gains in the Stoxx 600 post-earnings in which anticipated coronavirus losses are expected to be less severe than feared. Elsewhere, Pandora (-2.9%) withdrew guidance amid the outbreak and noted that China since Jan LFL sales fell 70-80% on a YY basis.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar is firmer across the board after losing momentum during Monday’s global stock market swoon, with the DXY firmly back on the 98.000 handle and breaching resistance ahead of the next big figure (like February 13’s 98.810 high) amidst more reports of the White House mulling a big aid package (Usd850 bn or perhaps more). However, safer-havens are clawing back some lost ground as the mood remains extremely fragile on COVID-19 factors and ahead of US data (retail sales and ip) that could highlight more of the economic contagion like yesterday’s NY Fed manufacturing survey.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - Minutes from the RBA’s March policy meeting did not offer anything new in terms of forward guidance overnight, but the Aussie is on the defensive in advance of Thursday’s new measures from the Central Bank that could include QE. Aud/Usd is slipping back towards 0.6000 and Aud/Nzd remains south of 1.0100 even though Nzd/Usd has retreated through 0.6000 and the Kiwi only got a fleeting fillip from Nzd12.1 bn fiscal stimulus in similar vein to the Aussie after Government and RBA cash/liquidity injections.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong> - A relatively upbeat UK labour and wage report has been dismissed as too old or irrelevant in the context of nCoV, as the Pound weakens across the board towards 1.2100 in Cable terms and sub-0.9100 on the Eur/Gbp cross. Indeed, Sterling is marginally underperforming vs the single currency despite a dire ZEW survey that has pushed Eur/Usd below 1.1100 (close to the 200 DMA) and eyeing Monday’s session trough just under 1.1050.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong> - The Franc and Yen are both off best levels vs the Greenback, but retaining an underlying bid within 0.9458-0.9554 and 105.88-107.18 respective ranges in advance of the SNB quarterly review and following ramped ETF purchases from the BoJ today.</p><p><strong>CAD/SEK/NOK</strong> - The Loonie is trying to stop the rot after losing 1.4000+ status against its US counterpart and tumbling to new multi-year lows not far from 1.4100, while the Swedish Crown is weaker vs the Euro inches from 11.0000 in wake of the Riskbank unleashing QE, finally and lagging its Scandi peer the is benefiting from a degree of consolidation and comparative stabilisation in crude prices, albeit choppy and still trending lower.</p><p>CBRT lowered its one-week repo rate by 100bps in an emergency move,</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>It’s akin to sell everything bar the Dollar again as debt futures remain depressed regardless of yet another tame/temporary revival in equites and other risk assets. Eurozone bonds are still underperfrming after the ECB’s relatively modest and ‘surgical’ policy stimulus, leaving Governments to take up the strain, but Gilts are also on the backfoot alongside <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> in wake of a solid, but not spectacular 2049 DMO placement given natural sponsorship from funds at the longer end of the maturity spectrum. Ahead, some top tier US data and API inventories, the Eurogroup meeting, further UK and possible US anti-nCoV aid announcements.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures have trimmed overnight gains during early EU trade, with the latter dipping into negative territory as the sentiment/consolidation seen in the APAC session abated as the underlying themes persist.&nbsp; <strong>WTI</strong> Apr’20 futures have extended losses below the USD 30/bbl mark, having earlier briefly breached the level to the upside, with the next pertinent support level at the YTD low around USD 27.40/bbl. Meanwhile, Brent May’20 underperforms its WTI counterpart given the OPEC rhetoric surrounding the global benchmark, with the front-</p><p>month contract back below USD 30/bbl and just off its YTD lows at ~USD 29.50/bbl vs. intraday high of USD 31.20/bbl. Meanwhile, the spread between the two contracts continue to narrow and currently stands at under USD 1/bbl vs. ~USD 1.30/bbl at yesterday’s close. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> continues to bear the brunt of liquidating positions as investors convert to cash and remain on the sidelines. The yellow metal trades firmly below 1500/oz (200 DMA ~1498/oz) ahead of the 50WMA (1462/oz) and yesterday’s 1450/oz low. Similar losses are seen across other precious metals with <strong>Silver</strong> approaching 12/oz after fleetingly dipping below the figure during yesterday’s trade. <strong>Copper</strong> prices unsurprisingly conform to the risk-turnaround as prices slide further below 2.5/lb and eyes USD 2.0/lb for barriers.</p>",

However, safer-havens are clawing back some lost ground as the mood remains extremely fragile on COVID-19 factors and ahead of US data (retail sales and ip) that could highlight more of the economic contagion like yesterday’s NY Fed manufacturing survey.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Minutes from the RBA’s March policy meeting did not offer anything new in terms of forward guidance overnight, but the Aussie is on the defensive in advance of Thursday’s new measures from the Central Bank that could include QE. Aud/Usd is slipping back towards 0.6000 and Aud/Nzd remains south of 1.0100 even though Nzd/Usd has retreated through 0.6000 and the Kiwi only got a fleeting fillip from Nzd12.1 bn fiscal stimulus in similar vein to the Aussie after Government and RBA cash/liquidity injections.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>A relatively upbeat UK labour and wage report has been dismissed as too old or irrelevant in the context of nCoV, as the Pound weakens across the board towards 1.2100 in Cable terms and sub-0.9100 on the Eur/Gbp cross. Indeed, Sterling is marginally underperforming vs the single currency despite a dire ZEW survey that has pushed Eur/Usd below 1.1100 (close to the 200 DMA) and eyeing Monday’s session trough just under 1.1050.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc and Yen are both off best levels vs the Greenback, but retaining an underlying bid within 0.9458-0.9554 and 105.88-107.18 respective ranges in advance of the SNB quarterly review and following ramped ETF purchases from the BoJ today.</p><p><strong>CAD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Loonie is trying to stop the rot after losing 1.4000+ status against its US counterpart and tumbling to new multi-year lows not far from 1.4100, while the Swedish Crown is weaker vs the Euro inches from 11.0000 in wake of the Riskbank unleashing QE, finally and lagging its Scandi peer the is benefiting from a degree of consolidation and comparative stabilisation in crude prices, albeit choppy and still trending lower.</p>",

However, despite more liquidity offered by the Fed, signs of stress remained in funding markets, as evidenced by FRA-OIS widening on the day, as well as the overnight GC rate spiking to 2.0%. The further tightening led the Fed to announce an additional overnight repo operation later on Monday, offering USD 500bln, seeing the rate move lower again on announcement, although still elevated significantly above the Fed’s new 0-0.25% target range. However, the later operation saw all USD 19.40bln bids accepted while the GC rate came back close to the FFR. Meanwhile, the Desk also carried out its ramped-up Treasury and MBS purchases across the curve – USD 40bln in Treasuries and USD 7.6bln in MBS on Monday.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets traded mixed and US equity futures hit limit up overnight as stock markets attempted to nurse the recent heavy losses that resulted to the worst day on Wall St. since 1987 and a near 3000-point decline in the DJIA for its largest point drop on record, despite the Fed’s recent emergency measures which aggravated concerns regarding the magnitude of the coronavirus fallout. The tone in Asia improved from the open spurring mixed views regarding a potential capitulation after the recent sell-off and some murmurs of a dead-cat bounce, although there were further supportive measures including a NZD 12.1bln economic package from New Zealand and the US House passing a revised coronavirus bill, as well as efforts from the Trump administration for an additional measure targeting airlines and small businesses. ASX 200 (+5.8%) outperformed after a rebound from support at the 5000 level to recoup some of the prior day’s record losses of 9.7% and eventually post its largest intraday gain since 2008 with miners and financials front running the recovery, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) fluctuated between gains and losses with sentiment flimsy alongside an indecisive currency. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) were both positive in early trade but then reversed course as early optimism across the region slightly faded and following further liquidity inaction by the PBoC, although reports have suggested the central bank may still reduce the Loan Prime Rate this week even though it opted to maintain rates in yesterday’s Medium-term Lending Facility. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lower as they tracked the recent selling in USTs but with some of the downside later reversed after prices found a platform around 152.50 and with the BoJ also in the market today under a special operation for JPY 200bln of JGBs with 3yr-10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets are mixed and US equity futures briefly hit limit up as stock markets attempt to nurse the recent heavy losses that resulted to the worst day on Wall St since 1987 and a near 3000-point decline in the DJIA for its largest point drop on record, despite the Fed’s emergency measures which aggravated concerns of how drastic the fallout was from the coronavirus pandemic. The tone in Asia initially improved amid further supportive measures including a NZD 12.1bln economic package from New Zealand and the US House passing a revised coronavirus bill, as well as efforts from the Trump administration for an additional coronavirus measure targeting airlines and small businesses, although the momentum later waned spurring murmurs of a dead-cat bounce. ASX 200 (+2.5%) outperforms after rebounding from support at the 5000 level to recoup some of the prior day’s record loss of 9.7%, with miners and financials front running the recovery, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) fluctuates between gains and losses with sentiment flimsy alongside an indecisive currency. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were both positive in early trade but then reversed course as early optimism across the region faded and following further liquidity inaction by the PBoC, although reports have suggested the central bank may still reduce the Loan Prime Rate this week even though it opted to maintain rates in yesterday’s Medium-term Lending Facility.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is lacklustre around the 98.00 level but is off the lows seen in the aftermath of the Fed’s recent emergency measures. The greenback’s major counterparts are also relatively uneventful with EUR/USD contained below resistance ahead of the 1.1200 handle and after further restrictions including the European Commission proposal of a 30-day ban on incoming travel for foreigners and with France to close Shengen area borders from today, while GBP/USD is relatively unchanged around 1.2250 with price action stuck near its 5-, 10- and 20-Hourly moving averages. Elsewhere, USD/JPY briefly attempted a reclaim of the 107.00 handle but then retraced gains amid the indecisive risk tone, while antipodeans are range bound as New Zealand’s economic measures only spurred marginal gains for NZD/USD and after the RBA minutes from the March meeting proved to be a non-event in which it reiterated that the board was prepared to ease further to support the economy.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they track the recent selling in USTs but with downside stemmed as prices find a platform around 152.50 and with the BoJ also in the market today for JPY 200bln of JGBs with 3yr-10yr maturities under a special operation.</p>",
