On the balance sheet he said it is highly appropriate to be open to adjusting balance sheet plan and the Fed is working towards a decision on the balance sheet in the coming months. Commenting on economic conditions he said the labour market is tight, inflationary pressures are muted and the Fed is meeting its inflation targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STATE OF THE UNION:</strong> Ahead of the much-awaited speech later today, a news reporter suggested that US President Trump is not planning to call a national emergency over the situation at the border wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM: </strong>The ISM non-manufacturing index fell to 56.7 in January, down 1.3 points from December&rsquo;s 58.0 and below the expected 57.2. Analysts at Pantheon note how the govt shutdown has hit the index after hitting consumer confidence although historically speaking the index is still remains strong. There were promising components beneath the headline, where the employment index rose for the first time in six months to 57.8 from 56.6, which supports the strong payroll figures, showing a continued steady pace of businesses hiring. While the domestic situation looked promising, global headwinds seeped through to the export orders index, which fell 9 points to a two-year low of 50.5, with Wells Fargo analysts noting, &ldquo;slower global growth and fading fiscal stimulus suggest the mid-50 readings are likely to become the norm as the year progresses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.90 LOWER AT USD 53.66/BBL, BRENT (J9) SETTLES USD 0.53 LOWER AT USD 61.98/BBL. </strong>Oil traded mixed on Tuesday, starting the session of brightly, before giving up gains, with traders citing expectations of a crude inventory build (this week&rsquo;s expectations: Crude +2.2mln, Cushing +0.9mln, distillates -1.8mln, gasoline +1.6mln). Analysts at Citi see today&rsquo;s price action as a consolidation. &ldquo;Gains in global equity markets (FTSE up 1.7%!) are a background support here, shrugging off the relatively soft January PMI data, while a firmer US dollar may slow the investment in commodities,&rdquo; the bank wrote. Analysts continue to cite uncertainty regarding the impact of Venezuelan politics on supply, as well as Russian production levels. Nevertheless, Citi says that this very much matches the pattern from the last round of cuts in 2017, with Russia facing technical issues in paring output during the winter season. &ldquo;Russia has been transparent regarding what it viewed as possible, and so we don&rsquo;t rate the minor 70,000 bpd decline in January output as a surprise.&nbsp; Instead, it&rsquo;s more of a down payment on the further gradual reduction to follow. Traders were also watching the earnings release from BP (BP LN); the O&amp;G name said it sees global oil demand rising by between 1.3-1.4mln BPD this year (that&rsquo;s a more optimistic view than OPEC&rsquo;s latest MOMR, which sees world oil demand growth of 1.29mln BPD this year), and sees Brent prices averaging USD 60/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.47% at 2738, NASDAQ +0.91% at 7024, DJI +0.68% at 25412. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.16%, Materials +0.80%, Industrials +0.87%, Cons Discretionary +0.96%, Cons Staples -0.02%, Healthcare -0.08%, Financials -0.14%, Tech +0.88%, Telecoms +0.91%, Utilities +0.12%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Alphabet (GOOGL) reported yesterday evening where it beat on top and bottom line estimates, but disappointed investors after reporting CAPEX above expectations. Gilead Sciences (GL) opened lower after missing on EPS estimates and lowered its sales guidance. Estee Lauder (EL) surged on the open following a beat on top and bottom line estimates and raising guidance; Ralph Lauren (RL) also beat estimates and surged. Emerson Electric (EM) dipped after missing revenue estimates. Apple (AAPL) pushed indices higher on the back of reports that its China iPhone sales had increased in January. Albemarle (ALB) and CenturyLink (CTL) underperformed after both receiving a downgrade at Citi. Boeing (BA) traded in the green after announcing plans to ramp up production of its 737 jet. Booking Holdings (BKNG) benefitted from an upgrade at Deutsche Bank. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dipped on the open on the back of Abu Dhabi fund Mubdala selling 3.49mln shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 5 TICKS HIGHER AT 121-28. </strong>Treasuries were marginally higher on Tuesday, in quiet markets conditions, with the complex catching a bid at the US cash open and continuing to drift higher for the rest of the session following a disappointing ISM Non-Mfg reading. Yields were lower by c.2bps across the curve at settlement. Spreads were mixed with some modest steepening from the belly to the long end and flatter elsewhere. The US Treasury sold USD 38bln in 3yr notes stopping through by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.502%, the lowest since April. Overall a decent auction with the bid-to-cover indicating that demand was close to recent averages. Also, the breakdown showed foreign buyers taking most of the supply, directs were awarded the biggest share since December 2015 and dealers were left with the smallest portion since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 10-YEAR NOTES AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 84bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday), and with no coupon or redemptions, net supply is implied at USD 84bln. The Fed will reinvest USD 9.2bln at the 3-year, USD 6.5bln at the 10-year, and USD 4.6bln at the 30-year auction. Analysts at Barclays note that recent 10-year auctions have seen decent demand; at the last auction, b/c rose to 2.51x, while dealer participation eased to 22%, the lowest in a year. Last month&#39;s auction also stopped through the screens by 0.8bps (versus a tail of 0.3bps for the six prior auctions). &quot;The 10-year sector seems to have set-up from a relative-value perspective,&quot; Societe Generale&#39;s analysts write, &quot;however, it is rich on an outright basis and will likely warrant concession going into the auction, as the WI yield is below all 10y auction stops since January 2018.&quot; SocGen also says that the sector has cheapened on the 2s10s curve since 31 January. &quot;The current 10y is trading cheap on the Treasury spline versus old 10s, which will likely benefit the auction. The last 10y auction stopped through, with an uptick in the bid/cover ratio, which is a positive for the upcoming auction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Another poor day for the Pound with no sign of any positive developments on the Brexit front and the UK services PMI continuing the run of sub-forecast headline readings with a worrying print only just above 50.0. This dragged the composite down to 50.3 and prompted IHS Markit to predict stagnation in Q1, resulting in Cable losing hold of 1.3000, breaching a Fib at 1.2976 and dipping below 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp rebounded to 0.8800+ from circa 0.8750 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, CAD, EUR, JPY:</strong> All weaker vs the Usd, as the DXY edges over 96.000, but the Franc paring some losses from 1.0020 toward parity again. Conversely, the Loonie failed to extend gains through 1.3100 when oil was in the ascendency and subsequently retreated to retest the 200 DMA at 1.3130 as crude retreated into negative territory. However, the single currency held in just above 1.1400 and 1.1 bn worth of option expiries from the big figure up to 1.1410 with the aid of a somewhat unexpected upward revision to the final pan Eurozone services PMI (as expansionary Spanish and German readings more than compensation for contractions in France and Italy). Similarly, Usd/Jpy was capped circa 110.00 even though broad risk appetite was healthy, with the Jpy retaining an underlying bid awaiting more US-China trade talk news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Both off best levels, but managing to withstand the latest Greenback advance and buck the overall trend, as the Aussie maintained its post-RBA policy meeting momentum and the Kiwi kept pace on a cross basis (Aud/Nzd back down around 1.0500 within a 1.0530-1.0455 range, Aud/Usd midway between 0.7195-0.7265 parameters and Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6900). To recap, the Australian Central Bank refrained from shifting to an easier stance even though it ratcheted down GDP forecasts for this year and next after recent weak economic indicators, not to mention a dire retail sales report just ahead of the RBA rate decision and accompanying statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: &nbsp;</strong>Not quite a turnaround Tuesday, but the Nok and Sek both benefited from the general improvement in risk sentiment and retraced some of yesterday&rsquo;s downside vs the Eur to sub-9.7000 and under 10.3900 respectively.</p>\r\n",

Analysts at Citi see today&rsquo;s price action as a consolidation. &ldquo;Gains in global equity markets (FTSE up 1.7%!) are a background support here, shrugging off the relatively soft January PMI data, while a firmer US dollar may slow the investment in commodities,&rdquo; the bank wrote. Analysts continue to cite uncertainty regarding the impact of Venezuelan politics on supply, as well as Russian production levels. Nevertheless, Citi says that this very much matches the pattern from the last round of cuts in 2017, with Russia facing technical issues in paring output during the winter season. &ldquo;Russia has been transparent regarding what it viewed as possible, and so we don&rsquo;t rate the minor 70,000 bpd decline in January output as a surprise.&nbsp; Instead, it&rsquo;s more of a down payment on the further gradual reduction to follow. Traders were also watching the earnings release from BP (BP LN); the O&amp;G name said it sees global oil demand rising by between 1.3-1.4mln BPD this year (that&rsquo;s a more optimistic view than OPEC&rsquo;s latest MOMR, which sees world oil demand growth of 1.29mln BPD this year), and sees Brent prices averaging USD 60/bbl.</p>\r\n",

This dragged the composite down to 50.3 and prompted IHS Markit to predict stagnation in Q1, resulting in Cable losing hold of 1.3000, breaching a Fib at 1.2976 and dipping below 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp rebounded to 0.8800+ from circa 0.8750 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All weaker vs the Usd, as the DXY edges over 96.000, but the Franc paring some losses from 1.0020 toward parity again. Conversely, the Loonie failed to extend gains through 1.3100 when oil was in the ascendency and subsequently retreated to retest the 200 DMA at 1.3130 as crude retreated into negative territory. However, the single currency held in just above 1.1400 and 1.1 bn worth of option expiries from the big figure up to 1.1410 with the aid of a somewhat unexpected upward revision to the final pan Eurozone services PMI (as expansionary Spanish and German readings more than compensation for contractions in France and Italy). Similarly, Usd/Jpy was capped circa 110.00 even though broad risk appetite was healthy, with the Jpy retaining an underlying bid awaiting more US-China trade talk news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both off best levels, but managing to withstand the latest Greenback advance and buck the overall trend, as the Aussie maintained its post-RBA policy meeting momentum and the Kiwi kept pace on a cross basis (Aud/Nzd back down around 1.0500 within a 1.0530-1.0455 range, Aud/Usd midway between 0.7195-0.7265 parameters and Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6900). To recap, the Australian Central Bank refrained from shifting to an easier stance even though it ratcheted down GDP forecasts for this year and next after recent weak economic indicators, not to mention a dire retail sales report just ahead of the RBA rate decision and accompanying statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not quite a turnaround Tuesday, but the Nok and Sek both benefited from the general improvement in risk sentiment and retraced some of yesterday&rsquo;s downside vs the Eur to sub-9.7000 and under 10.3900 respectively.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+2.0%) was the stellar performer due to strength in its largest weighted financials sector as banks seemingly made light of the Banking Royal Commission final report regarding misconduct in the industry. As such, Australia&rsquo;s banking powerhouses all edged firm gains in the aftermath of the report which recommended against structural separation and referred 24 misconduct cases to regulators but did not suggest criminal charges, while many viewed the report as unlikely to result in fundamental reforms for the industry in the long-term and Moody&rsquo;s also noted that the recommendations will likely preserve profitability in the industry. Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) shrugged off opening gains and traded flat as earnings remained the main driver for price action in Tokyo after Panasonic cut its outlook, while Yahoo Japan outperformed following an upward revision to its FY giudance. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially pressured as they followed suit to the recent downside in T-notes, although prices later rebounded following the 10yr auction in which the b/c and accepted prices increased from prior, while the average yield slipped to negative territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said in report to Congress that the US intends to hold China accountable for unfair market distorting trade practices that harm US workers, businesses or farmers.

The RBA reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy and that progress on inflation and unemployment is expected to be gradual. Furthermore, the RBA noted that the labour market remains strong and that it sees a gradual inflation pick up over next couple of years but added that the central scenario for GDP growth is to average around 3% this year and to slow in 2020 vs. Prev. forecast of around 3.5% growth for the next 2 years back at the December meeting.

Furthermore, Mester forecasts 2.00-2.50% GDP growth, 2% inflation and unemployment at 4% for this year, while she added that rates may need to go a bit higher if economy performs as she expects but will adjust outlook and policy views if the economy is weaker than what she anticipates.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An upbeat session for European equities thus far following on from a holiday-thinned Asia-Pac session as the region is fuelled by a number of large-cap earnings. Major indices extended on opening gains and are firmly in positive territory (Euro Stoxx 50 +1.0%) with Britain&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (+1.4%) leading the advances amid upbeat earnings from heavyweight BP (+5.2%), wherein the oil-giant beat on adjusted net and revenue forecasts while also expecting higher underlying production and lower refining margins this fiscal year. Sectors are experiencing broad-based gains with the energy sector the marked outperformer as earnings from BP lifts the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (+1.7%) and Total (+1.6%) in sympathy. Elsewhere, the tech sector is largely resilient to a guidance cut from AMS (-13.2%), as the rebound in Wirecard (+6.5%) keeps the sector afloat. Meanwhile, Infineon (-0.3%) numbers printed largely in-line, though the company now expects 2019 revenue growth to be at the bottom end of the forecast range. Finally, Indivior (-11.4%) shares fell as much as 24% at the EU open after the US Federal Court rejected its appeal for another hearing regarding patent infringement by a low-cost copycat drug developed by Dr Reddy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Top G10 performer after a sharp turnaround in fortunes overnight, as the Aussie recovered impressively from sub-0.7200 lows vs the Usd and circa 1.0455 vs the Nzd in wake of a less dovish than many anticipated RBA policy statement. This, despite yet more disappointing data in the form of retail sales and downgrades to the outlook for growth in 2019 and 2020. Aud/Usd is now back up near 0.7250 and Aud/Nzd has rebounded over 1.0500+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc has extended recent losses vs the Greenback and just traded down through parity amidst broadly risk on trade highlighted by broad EU equity market gains, and the Chf seemingly taking some of the strain from the Jpy that has rebounded from 110.00+ vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Both on the back foot vs the Dollar and inching closer towards downside big figures at 1.1400 and 1.3000 respectively. The single currency tested bids around 1.1410 before gleaning some traction from a firmer than flash pan-Eurozone services PMI as sub-50.00 Italian and French prints were offset by more encouraging Spanish and German surveys (in headline terms at least). However, Eur/Usd remains precarious below several daily chart levels and just above decent option expiries between 1.1400-10 (1.1 bn). Conversely, Cable has now breached the 200 DMA (around 1.3038) following a 3rd and most worrying UK PMI miss given the importance of services to overall GDP. The Pound is holding just above late January lows, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded towards recent peaks not far from 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie continues track moves in crude prices and is back on the front foot vs its US counterpart having rebounded above the 200 DMA (1.3130) and retesting chart/psychological resistance at 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Although the Usd is mixed vs major currency rivals, the index has inched a bit closer to the 96.000 mark, largely by virtue of the aforementioned Eur/Usd decline and that pair&rsquo;s biggest weighting in the basket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both slipped to new intraday troughs in recent trade, at 164.99 and 122.98 respectively, as EU equities consolidate and build on gains. However, the 10 year benchmarks have not succumbed to follow-through selling or triggered more stops to test the next set of downside chart targets as one might have anticipated. The core Eurozone debt future did trip some on a break of the 165.12-09 area that incorporated a Fib, but is back above 165.00 and its UK equivalent is now just over par after the latest considerably weaker than consensus PMI. It looks like Bunds may be deriving some underlying support from the corresponding 10 year yield holding around 0.20% in the same vein that 0.15% proved sticky on the downside (upside in futures terms). Elsewhere, US Treasuries are on the back foot and the curve a tad steeper, awaiting data and the first slug of this week&rsquo;s supply, but there have been some bullish flows noted via options during the overnight session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively choppy session for the oil market as earlier losses were nursed after a muted Asia-Pac trade. WTI (+1.1%) and Brent (+0.7%) edged higher in recent trade amid the overall market risk-appetite wherein the former reclaimed USD 53/bbl, while the latter hovers around the USD 63/bbl level. News flow has been light for the complex with participants awaiting the release of the weekly API crude inventories for a further catalyst. Elsewhere, metals have been mixed with spot gold (+0.1%) largely moving in tandem with the buck, meanwhile copper is outperforming in the complex with prices holding onto most of yesterday&rsquo;s risk-fuelled gains. Finally, iron ore prices remain on an upward trajectory as Brazilian mining-giant Vale suspended operations at its Brucutu mine to comply with a court order regarding safety improvement at the mine, ING notes &ldquo;the mine halt could impact 30mtpa of iron ore supply if Vale is unable to successfully appeal the decision.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US doesn&#39;t plan to extend sanction waivers to purchasers of Iranian oil and are seeking to reduce Iranian oil shipments to zero ASAP, according to reports citing US State Department Senior Policy Adviser Hook.

Major indices extended on opening gains and are firmly in positive territory (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.8%) with Britain&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (+1.0%) leading the advances amid upbeat earnings from heavyweight BP (+4.0%), wherein the oil-giant beat on adjusted net and revenue forecasts while also expecting higher underlying production and lower refining margins this fiscal year. Sectors are experiencing broad-based gains with the energy sector the marked outperformer as earnings from BP lifts the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (+1.5%) and Total (+1.4%) in sympathy. Elsewhere, the tech sector is largely resilient to a guidance cut from AMS (-12.7%), as the rebound in Wirecard (+6.6%) keeps the sector afloat. Meanwhile, Infineon (-0.3%) numbers printed largely in-line, though the company now expects 2019 revenue growth to be at the bottom end of the forecast range. Finally, Indivior (-9.6%) shares fell as much as 24% at the EU open after the US Federal Court rejected its appeal for another hearing regarding patent infringement by a low-cost copycat drug developed by Dr Reddy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Top G10 performer after a sharp turnaround in fortunes overnight, as the Aussie recovered impressively from sub-0.7200 lows vs the Usd and circa 1.0455 vs the Nzd in wake of a less dovish than many anticipated RBA policy statement. This, despite yet more disappointing data in the form of retail sales and downgrades to the outlook for growth in 2019 and 2020. Aud/Usd is now back up near 0.7250 and Aud/Nzd has rebounded over 1.0500+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc has extended recent losses vs the Greenback and just traded down through parity amidst broadly risk on trade highlighted by broad EU equity market gains, and the Chf seemingly taking some of the strain from the Jpy that has rebounded from 110.00+ vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Both on the back foot vs the Dollar and inching closer towards downside big figures at 1.1400 and 1.3000 respectively. The single currency tested bids around 1.1410 before gleaning some traction from a firmer than flash pan-Eurozone services PMI as sub-50.00 Italian and French prints were offset by more encouraging Spanish and German surveys (in headline terms at least). However, Eur/Usd remains precarious below several daily chart levels and just above decent option expiries between 1.1400-10 (1.1 bn). Conversely, Cable has now breached the 200 DMA (around 1.3038) following a 3rd and most worrying UK PMI miss given the importance of services to overall GDP. The Pound is holding just above late January lows, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded towards recent peaks not far from 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie continues track moves in crude prices and is back on the front foot vs its US counterpart having rebounded above the 200 DMA (1.3130) and retesting chart/psychological resistance at 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Although the Usd is mixed vs major currency rivals, the index has inched a bit closer to the 96.000 mark, largely by virtue of the aforementioned Eur/Usd decline and that pair&rsquo;s biggest weighting in the basket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both slipped to new intraday troughs in recent trade, at 164.99 and 122.98 respectively, as EU equities consolidate and build on gains. However, the 10 year benchmarks have not succumbed to follow-through selling or triggered more stops to test the next set of downside chart targets as one might have anticipated. The core Eurozone debt future did trip some on a break of the 165.12-09 area that incorporated a Fib, but is back above 165.00 and its UK equivalent is now just over par after the latest considerably weaker than consensus PMI. It looks like Bunds may be deriving some underlying support from the corresponding 10 year yield holding around 0.20% in the same vein that 0.15% proved sticky on the downside (upside in futures terms). Elsewhere, US Treasuries are on the back foot and the curve a tad steeper, awaiting data and the first slug of this week&rsquo;s supply, but there have been some bullish flows noted via options during the overnight session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively choppy session for the oil market as earlier losses were nursed after a muted Asia-Pac trade. WTI (+1.0%) and Brent (+0.7%) edged higher in recent trade amid the overall market risk-appetite wherein the former reclaimed USD 53/bbl, while the latter hovers around the USD 63/bbl level. News flow has been light for the complex with participants awaiting the release of the weekly API crude inventories for a further catalyst. Elsewhere, metals have been mixed with spot gold (Unch) largely moving in tandem with the buck, meanwhile copper is outperforming in the complex with prices holding onto most of yesterday&rsquo;s risk-fuelled gains. Finally, iron ore prices remain on an upward trajectory as Brazilian mining-giant Vale suspended operations at its Brucutu mine to comply with a court order regarding safety improvement at the mine, ING notes &ldquo;the mine halt could impact 30mtpa of iron ore supply if Vale is unable to successfully appeal the decision.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top G10 performer after a sharp turnaround in fortunes overnight, as the Aussie recovered impressively from sub-0.7200 lows vs the Usd and circa 1.0455 vs the Nzd in wake of a less dovish than many anticipated RBA policy statement. This, despite yet more disappointing data in the form of retail sales and downgrades to the outlook for growth in 2019 and 2020. Aud/Usd is now back up near 0.7250 and Aud/Nzd has rebounded over 1.0500+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc has extended recent losses vs the Greenback and just traded down through parity amidst broadly risk on trade highlighted by broad EU equity market gains, and the Chf seemingly taking some of the strain from the Jpy that has rebounded from 110.00+ vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both on the back foot vs the Dollar and inching closer towards downside big figures at 1.1400 and 1.3000 respectively. The single currency tested bids around 1.1410 before gleaning some traction from a firmer than flash pan-Eurozone services PMI as sub-50.00 Italian and French prints were offset by more encouraging Spanish and German surveys (in headline terms at least). However, Eur/Usd remains precarious below several daily chart levels and just above decent option expiries between 1.1400-10 (1.1 bn). Conversely, Cable has now breached the 200 DMA (around 1.3038) following a 3rd and most worrying UK PMI miss given the importance of services to overall GDP. The Pound is holding just above late January lows, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded towards recent peaks not far from 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues track moves in crude prices and is back on the front foot vs its US counterpart having rebounded above the 200 DMA (1.3130) and retesting chart/psychological resistance at 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Usd is mixed vs major currency rivals, the index has inched a bit closer to the 96.000 mark, largely by virtue of the aforementioned Eur/Usd decline and that pair&rsquo;s biggest weighting in the basket.</p>\r\n",

As such, Australia&rsquo;s banking powerhouses all edged firm gains in the aftermath of the report which recommended against structural separation and referred 24 misconduct cases to regulators but did not suggest criminal charges, while many viewed the report as unlikely to result in fundamental reforms for the industry in the long-term and Moody&rsquo;s also noted that the recommendations will likely preserve profitability in the industry.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY was contained by the indecision in Japan, while antipodeans provided much of the price action overnight with early volatility seen in some NZD-crosses amid thin conditions although the moves were reversed shortly after. AUD/USD initially underperformed and briefly slipped below the 0.7200 handle following disappointing Retail Sales data, but then rebounded after the RBA rate decision in which they kept rates unchanged at the record low 1.50% as expected and with the announcement interpreted as less dovish than some had expected. The central bank mostly stuck with its usual rhetoric despite the recent slew of less than satisfactory data releases and shifting expectations that the RBA could cut this year as futures markets had implied around 50% chance of RBA lowering rates by year-end. The RBA also repeated that it expects inflation to pick up gradually, while it noted an increase in terms of trade and expects unemployment to fall further to 4.75% vs. current 5.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate Target unchanged at 1.50% as expected. The RBA reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy and that progress on inflation and unemployment is expected to be gradual. Furthermore, the RBA noted that the labour market remains strong and that it sees a gradual inflation pick up over next couple of years but added that the central scenario for GDP growth is to average around 3% this year and to slow in 2020 vs. Prev. forecast of around 3.5% growth for the next 2 years back at the December meeting.

As such, WTI crude futures consolidated after the swings seen in the prior session where prices pulled back from 2-month highs, while gold was also uneventful amid a similar picture in the greenback. Elsewhere, copper somewhat outperformed the complex in which prices mildly extended on yesterday&rsquo;s risk-fuelled gains to above the USD 2.80/lb level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US doesn&#39;t plan to extend sanction waivers to purchasers of Iranian oil and are seeking to reduce Iranian oil shipments to zero ASAP, according to reports citing US State Department Senior Policy Adviser Hook.

The complex ticked temporarily higher after Factory Orders missed expectations. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. In afternoon trade the complex attempted to stir direction but struggled to retain gains and ended the session close to lows of the day. Spreads were close to the unchanged mark, and only slightly steeper. US T-note futures (H9) settled 7 ticks lower at 121-23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&#39;s inaugural committee said it received a subpoena for documents.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed said Chairman Powell and Vice Chair Clarida met with President Trump at the White House in which they discussed the economic outlook.

Furthermore, Mester forecasts 2.00-2.50% GDP growth, 2% inflation and unemployment at 4% for this year, while she added that rates may need to go a bit higher if economy performs as she expects but will adjust outlook and policy views if the economy is weaker than what she anticipates.

        "content": "<p>The RBA will conduct its first policy meeting for 2019 in which the consensus is for rates to be kept unchanged with 39 out of 40 economists forecasting the Cash Rate Target to be maintained at the record low 1.5% and with 1 economist calling for a 25bps cut. In addition, ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures price in 100% expectations for the Cash Rate Target to be maintained, while its associated implied yield curve also suggests expectations for the RBA to maintain rates for most the year until November when the curve leans closer towards a 25bps cut which is in contrast with 2 months ago when the curve had suggested a potential hike in February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite shifting expectations by market watchers on the RBA&#39;s future policy action, the central bank itself has remained adamant regarding a future hike in which RBA&#39;s Harper reiterated that the next move in rates is expected to be up. Furthermore, the minutes from the last meeting also reiterated the board agreed the next move in rates is likely to be up than down but saw no strong case for a near-term change in policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent data from Australia has been somewhat inconclusive and therefore also supports a wait and see approach as Australian CPI for Q4 printed firmer than expected at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 1.9%), but also showed inflation was below the RBA&#39;s 2%-3% target for a 2nd consecutive quarter. The latest jobs data was also open to question despite Employment Change topping estimates at 21.6K vs. Exp. 16.5K (Prev. 37.0K) as this was solely fuelled by Part-Time Employment, while a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.0% from Prev. 5.1% coincided with an equal percentage point drop in the Participation Rate to 65.6%. The latest figures announced this week have also flashed further warning signs for the property industry and is likely to catch the attention of policy makers with Building Approvals at its largest contraction in more than 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other factors which support the case for the RBA to remain on hold include ongoing concerns of a slowdown in the Chinese economy which grew at the slowest pace in nearly 3 decades for 2018, considering Australia&#39;s heavy exposure to China. Elsewhere, increasing expectations of the Fed being on pause mode and shift to a patient approach alleviates pressure for the RBA to tighten, while big 4 bank NAB&#39;s recent announcement to hike mortgage rates due to higher funding costs also reduces ability for the RBA to increase rates especially against the backdrop of a weakening housing sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate decision is scheduled at 0330GMT/2130CST/1130HKT and as a hold in rates is widely expected, focus will be on the RBA&#39;s statement and tone as well as if there are any significant changes to its continuously rehashed rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Comments and Calls<br />- Barclays no longer sees the RBA hiking rates next year vs. Prev. forecast for 2 hikes in H1 2020, while it believes the bank may sound more cautious and data dependent at today&#39;s meeting.<br />- AMP Capital&#39;s Shane Oliver sees RBA cutting rates to 1.00% this year, citing falling building approvals and negative wealth effect from declining house prices dragging on economic growth.<br />- HSBC sees AUD/USD declining further this year to 0.6600 and Rabobank sees the pair at 0.6800 citing &#39;doom loop&#39; of debt which threatens to weigh heavily on AUD.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets found some early support from the tech-led gains on Wall St. but have since turned somewhat mixed amid focus on earnings and with most the region shut for the Lunar New Year. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+2.3%) is the stellar performer with its largest weighted financials sector frontrunning the advances as banks seemingly make light of the Banking Royal Commission final report regarding misconduct in the industry. As such, Australia&rsquo;s banking powerhouses have all edged firm gains in the aftermath of the report which recommended against structural separation and referred 24 misconduct cases to regulators but did not suggest criminal charges, while many viewed the report as unlikely to result in fundamental reforms for the industry in the long-term and Moody&rsquo;s also noted that the recommendations will likely preserve profitability in the industry. Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) shrugged off opening gains to trade flat as earnings remained the main driver for price action in Tokyo with Panasonic the worst hit after it posted a decline in 9-month net and lowered its oper. profit and revenue outlook, while Yahoo Japan outperforms following an upward revision to the bottom range of its FY guidance despite the Co. missing on 9-month top and bottom lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the lack of participants has kept the greenback flat overnight and most its major counterparts rangebound, with EUR/USD and GBP/USD attempting to nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s mild losses. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is contained by the indecision in Japan, while antipodeans have provided much of the overnight price action with early volatility seen in some NZD-crosses amid thin conditions although the moves were reversed shortly after. Furthermore, AUD/USD is the underperformer and briefly slipped below the 0.7200 handle following disappointing Retail Sales data, with focus for the pair now shifting to the RBA rate decision later where the central bank is expected to continue its prolonged pause and keep rates at the record low 1.50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are pressured as they follow suit to the recent downside in T-notes and with participants also sidelined prior to today&rsquo;s 10yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",
