That theme continued throughout the session, and in later trade, the VIX tested all-time highs. The Fed's measures taken over the weekend again highlight how bad the situation is getting, dragging rates lower, while grim China activity data was also reported - similar was seen in the NY Fed survey. Banks have been cutting its estimate of US GDP growth, and sees the size of the economy shrinking by 5% in Q2, and later President Trump said US \"may be\" heading into a recession. Amid COVID-19, multiple companies announced closures of stores and operations, where retailers such as Nike (NKE), Lululemon (LULU), Under Armour (UAA) and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) are temporarily closing some of its stores across America. Nike (NKE) however, is expanding its closures to Western Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) announced it is closing all of its stores outside of China for the next two weeks. Multiple casino operators are suspending operations, particularly in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is temporarily halting operations at its Las Vegas resort. Cruise liners (CCL, RCL, NCLH) are also halting operations and Airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV) are preparing for further disruption. Elsewhere, the FAA is reportedly considering enhanced inspections on Boeing (BA) 737 jets after an inflight incident on a Southwestern Airlines (LUV) plane saw a 12-inch rupture in the aluminium skin of the plane.

However, despite more liquidity offered by the Fed, signs of stress remained in funding markets, as evidenced by FRA-OIS widening on the day, as well as the overnight GC rate spiking to 2.0%. The further tightening led the Fed to announce an additional overnight repo operation later on Monday, offering USD 500bln, seeing the rate move lower again on announcement, although still elevated significantly above the Fed’s new 0-0.25% target range. However, the later operation saw all USD 19.40bln bids accepted while the GC rate came back close to the FFR. Meanwhile, the Desk also carried out its ramped-up Treasury and MBS purchases across the curve – USD 40bln in Treasuries and USD 7.6bln in MBS on Monday. T-Notes (H0) settled 2 points and 8+ ticks higher at 138-02.</p>",

Supply: UK.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>US stocks were hammered again on Monday, with the circuit breaker tripped after about a minute of trading. That theme continued throughout the session, and in later trade, the VIX tested all-time highs. The Fed's measures taken over the weekend again highlight how bad the situation is getting, dragging rates lower, while grim China activity data was also reported - similar was seen in the NY Fed survey. Banks have been cutting its estimate of US GDP growth, and sees the size of the economy shrinking by 5% in Q2, and later President Trump said US \"may be\" heading into a recession. US cases of the virus have risen over 3,500 from under 1,700 at the previous update; the White House has recommended 15-day guidelines (details below). Meanwhile, the Senate is to consider the House virus bill, and Senator Schumer suggested Senators could request USD 750bln package to combat the spread.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>FOMC cut the Fed Funds Rate 100bps to 0.00%-0.25% via 9-1 vote (Mester dissented preferring a 50bps cut) and the Fed launched USD 700bln QE program in which it will increase Treasury purchases by at least USD 500bln and raise MBS purchases by USD 200bln. Fed expects target interest rates will remain in this range until economy has weathered recent events and is on track to meet inflation and employment targets, while it is reducing requirement ratio to 0% effective March 26th. Fed Chair Powell said that the emergency FOMC meeting was in lieu of meeting on March 17th-18th. Furthermore, Powell the Fed doesn't see negative rates as appropriate policy response in the US and he is willing to be patient in assessing when to raise rates back from near-zero. Fed, BoJ, BoE, Bank of Canada, ECB and SNB have agreed to lower pricing on standing US Dollar liquidity swaps by 25bps and that central banks will offer US Dollar swaps with 84-day maturities in addition to 1-week operations.</p><p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>The NY Fed’s Desk’s USD 500bln 30-day term operation and USD 175bln o/n op were both undersubscribed, the former seeing all USD 18.45bln bids accepted (500bln offered) and the latter seeing all USD 129.60bln bids accepted (175bln offered). However, despite more liquidity offered by the Fed, signs of stress remained in funding markets, as evidenced by FRA-OIS widening on the day, as well as the overnight GC rate spiking to 2.0%. The further tightening led the Fed to announce an additional overnight repo operation later on Monday, offering USD 500bln, seeing the rate move lower again on announcement, although still elevated significantly above the Fed’s new 0-0.25% target range. However, the later operation saw all USD 19.40bln bids accepted while the GC rate came back close to the FFR. Meanwhile, the Desk also carried out its ramped-up Treasury and MBS purchases across the curve – USD 40bln in Treasuries and USD 7.6bln in MBS on Monday. T-Notes (H0) settled 2 points and 8+ ticks higher at 138-02.</p><p><strong>* MARKET CLOSURES:</strong> There has been some speculation that markets could be closed due to the information uncertainty creating choppy trading conditions. Additionally, some draw attention to the unforeseen credit events that could spur if valuations continue to tumble, triggering credit facility covenants. However, SEC Chair said on Monday that markets should stay open despite intense volatility, and that the SEC was closely monitoring markets and was working with exchanges and market infrastructure providers to ensure they could continue to function. Note that equity indices nearly reached their 13% limit down shortly after the US cash equity open on Monday This sentiment was also echoed by NYSE President too.</p><p><strong>* MONETARY POLICY:</strong> RBNZ lowered the OCR by 75bps to 0.25% in an emergency meeting and stated that the OCR is to remain at 0.25% for at least a year, while it delayed higher capital requirements for banks and stated that if more stimulus is required, the preference is large scale government bond purchases instead of another rate cut. BoJ held an emergency monetary policy meeting in which it kept short-term rates at -0.10% and maintained long-term yield target at 0%, but raised purchases of ETFs and J-REITS. BoJ announced additional JPY 100bln JGB purchases. RBA said it is to conduct 1-month and 3-month operations until further notice, while it will conduct 6-month operations or longer at least weekly. Furthermore, the RBA later said it added AUD 5.9bln to banking system through market repo operations, while it is ready to purchase Australia government bonds and will announce further policy steps on Thursday. HKMA lowered its base rate by 64bps to 0.86% and announced that the countercyclical buffer is to be lowered to 1% from 2% with immediate effect. BoK cuts key base rate by 50bps to 0.75% in an emergency move. Later, Riksbank said it will boost asset purchases and take measures to facilitate credit supply; will support economic developments and avoid credit supply issues; Will increase loans to banks on favourable terms, will buy SEK 300bln of bonds, and says it will take additional measures if necessary; Riksbank notes there will be negative impacts on activity from COVID, but says it is uncertain how deep.</p><p><strong>* US MEASURES:</strong> On the weekend, US House voted 363-40 to pass bill to make coronavirus testing free and require paid sick leave for those impacted by the coronavirus outbreak; Senate will reconvene on Monday to consider that bill. Over the weekend, the CDC also recommended that Americans cancel or postpone gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. NEC Director Kudlow the US is considering sending cash to households as short-term relief. Kudlow also said there is more than USD 800bln of fiscal measures available, including a possible payroll tax holiday, that could or have been put in place to support the US. Kudlow also said that the Administration is mulling 100% expensing companies moving back to the US from China and elsewhere; the story is in keeping with remarks from White House Navarro said he was bringing an executive order to US President Trump which would lower the dependency on foreign countries for medicines. Elsewhere, White House is drafting a financial assistance package for airlines that is expected to include direct help, loans, and tax relief, sources report. Note that US Senate Minority Leader Schumer proposed a USD 750bln COVID-19 package later on Monday. Elsewhere, US CDC says 53 states have reported cases as of Sunday 4pm, versus 47 on Saturday; cases now at 3536 vs 1678. White House recommends 15-day nationwide guidelines to slow spread of virus; recommends avoiding social gatherings, says affected states should close schools and surrounding areas</p><p><strong>* IMF MEASURES:</strong> IMF said it is ready to mobilize USD 1trln loan capacity to fight COVID-19, writing that fiscal stimulus will be necessary to prevent long-lasting economic damage, such as raised paid sick leave and targeted tax relief. The institution said it has received interest from about 20 more countries for ongoing loan programmes, in addition to 40 existing programmes totalling USD 200bln, and said that central bank swap lines to EM countries could be needed. The IMD said forex interventions and capital flow management measures can usefully complement monetary policy actions, and banks should use their capital and liquidity buffers as well as renegotiate loan terms for stressed borrowers. The Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust for the poorest countries has about USD 400mln available for potential debt relief, looking to raise it to USD 1bln.</p><p><strong>* EU MEASURES:</strong> The EU could immediately offer EUR 28-40bln to support SMEs in the region who have been hit by coronavirus, according to a letter from the European Investment Bank to EU finance ministers. Separately, the EU now thinks the economy will shrink 1.0% this year (previously it had pencilled in a RISE of 1.4% in 2020); earlier, Germany's Finance Ministry said it expects GDP to shrink in 2020, and expects to see the impact of COVID-19 on tax revenues and state spending. German Finance Minister Scholz says the country will counter the economic impact of the coronavirus \"with full force\", says fiscal measures to counter the virus will impact federal budget plans from 2021-24; Germany ready to take on new debt if necessary to combat the virus, according to economy minister Altmaier. France President Macron says all companies must take steps to work from home; says citizens should work from home and only leave for essential duties; will step up measures to limit peoples' movements. Macron also said Shengen area borders in France will be shut from tomorrow midday, in coordination with EU nations; he also said gas, electricity, water bills and rent will be suspended; French companies loans will benefit from state guarantee worth a total 300bln euros. Later, Eurozone finance ministers agreed to fiscal boost of 1%/GDP to combat COVID, and the Eurogroup said it has thus far committed to providing liquidity facilities amounting to at least 10% of GDP - these figures could be much larger going forward.</p><p><strong>* TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS: </strong>The European Commission proposed a 30-day ban on incoming travel for foreigners. \"The less travel, the more we can contain the virus. Therefore ... I propose to the heads of state and government to introduce temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU,\" EC Chief von der Leyen said, adding \"these travel restrictions should be in place for an initial period of 30 days, but can be prolonged as necessary.\" There would be exclusions for long-term EU residents, family of EU nationals, as well as doctors and researchers working on containing the virus.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile<strong> </strong>Canadian President Trudeau declared that Canada would close its borders to non-citizens and non-residents, although the ban won’t apply to commerce or trade.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 3.03 LOWER AT USD 28.70/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLES USD 3.80 LOWER AT USD 30.05/BBL: </strong>Energy markets were offered heavily to kick off the week as oil prices broke to levels not seen since the 2016 trough. Negative sentiment was evident in both oil futures and the further losses in global equity markets. Additionally, the outlook remains dismal on the supply side of the market too, as Russia and Saudi ramp-up production in their new price war. Saudi Aramco said on Monday it would be producing at its maximum capacity and is currently looking at raising its output to 13mln BPD; the oil behemoth added that it is very comfortable with oil at USD 30/bbl. Furthermore, the OPEC/OPEC+ JTC meeting planned for March 18th in Vienna has reportedly been cancelled, diminishing hopes of potential coordination even at the lower level. Following the Trump administration announcing on Friday it would be purchasing oil via the SPR, on Monday it was reported the US could start purchasing crude in the next two weeks, specifically that 77mln barrels of US-produced oil could be purchased, without any mention of purchasing foreign grades. Goldman Sachs said the SPR purchases could raise the equilibrium price where global oil market rebalances by USD 2/bbl, adding that the purchases could be insufficient to reverse the increasingly likely risk Brent declines beneath Q2-Q3 USD 30/bbl forecast, however. IHS Markit said the oil markets are facing a possible build-up of the most extreme oil supply surplus ever recorded, saying US production could decline between 2-4mln BPD over the next 18-months, with the surplus potentially growing to 800mln-1.3bln barrels in the first half of 2020 – the market will increasingly expect the support from the SPR if/as these forecasts become realized.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq that the US would continue to take self-defence measures if it is attacked; the statement followed the weekend rocket attack on an Iraqi base that houses US troops.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -11.99% at 2386, NDX -12.19% at 7020, DJI -12.94% at 20,186. <strong>Sectors:</strong> consumer staples -6.66%, telecoms -6.82%, health care -9.32%, basic materials -10.7%, cyclicals -10.83%, industrials -11.09%, utilities -11.58%, energy -12.92%, tech -13.09%, financials -13.23%.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US BANKS: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the banking system in the US \"can handle this\" in wake of the Federal reserve's emergency action. Mnuchin believes that the Fed is ahead of issues, noting nobody has to pull money out of banks. The goal is not to bail out companies and it aims to ensure businesses have liquidity, Mnuchin said, and stated there will be a surge of demand for stocks once the threat of coronavirus is gone.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Amid COVID-19, multiple companies announced closures of stores and operations, where retailers such as Nike (NKE), Lululemon (LULU), Under Armour (UAA) and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) are temporarily closing some of its stores across America. Nike (NKE) however, is expanding its closures to Western Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) announced it is closing all of its stores outside of China for the next two weeks. Multiple casino operators are suspending operations, particularly in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is temporarily halting operations at its Las Vegas resort. Cruise liners (CCL, RCL, NCLH) are also halting operations and Airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV) are preparing for further disruption. Elsewhere, the FAA is reportedly considering enhanced inspections on Boeing (BA) 737 jets after an inflight incident on a Southwestern Airlines (LUV) plane saw a 12-inch rupture in the aluminium skin of the plane. Apple (AAPL) is to be fined EUR 1.2bln over anti-competitive behaviour by French authorities. Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates stepped down from the board, while also stepping down from the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) board. On the credit front, Micron (MU) announced it is to draw down USD 2.5bln through its revolving credit facility, and Carnival (CCL) is to borrow USD 3bln under a facility agreement for six months, as part of the growing cohort of US corporates drawing on funding markets.</p>",

Negative sentiment was evident in both oil futures and the further losses in global equity markets. Additionally, the outlook remains dismal on the supply side of the market too, as Russia and Saudi ramp-up production in their new price war. Saudi Aramco said on Monday it would be producing at its maximum capacity and is currently looking at raising its output to 13mln BPD; the oil behemoth added that it is very comfortable with oil at USD 30/bbl. Furthermore, the OPEC/OPEC+ JTC meeting planned for March 18th in Vienna has reportedly been cancelled, diminishing hopes of potential coordination even at the lower level. Following the Trump administration announcing on Friday it would be purchasing oil via the SPR, on Monday it was reported the US could start purchasing crude in the next two weeks, specifically that 77mln barrels of US-produced oil could be purchased, without any mention of purchasing foreign grades. Goldman Sachs said the SPR purchases could raise the equilibrium price where global oil market rebalances by USD 2/bbl, adding that the purchases could be insufficient to reverse the increasingly likely risk Brent declines beneath Q2-Q3 USD 30/bbl forecast, however. IHS Markit said the oil markets are facing a possible build-up of the most extreme oil supply surplus ever recorded, saying US production could decline between 2-4mln BPD over the next 18-months, with the surplus potentially growing to 800mln-1.3bln barrels in the first half of 2020 – the market will increasingly expect the support from the SPR if/as these forecasts become realized.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Yen is still outperforming on safe-haven grounds as another round of global Central Bank monetary easing (including the BoJ) and fiscal support from Governments fails to convince markets that China’s COVID-19 pandemic won’t wreak more havoc before the worst is over. However, sentiment has gradually improved since the US open and the latest 7% circuit breaks for the main Wall Street benchmarks forced a pause in trade and subsequent consolidation. Hence, Usd/Jpy is back above 106.00 within 105.16-107.91 parameters, while the Loonie and Aussie have rebounded from worst levels sub-0.6100 and close to 1.4000 again vs their US counterpart, even though the <strong>DXY</strong> has pared some of its post-Fed rate cut (100 bp) and QE (Usd700 bn) declines. In fact, the index bounced just over a full point at one stage between 97.446-98.473 extremes as US Treasuries yields bottomed and the curve re-steepened.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/NZD/EUR</strong></p><p>All now firmer against the Greenback, albeit with the Franc losing momentum after a test of resistance around 0.9400 and the Pound unable to sustain gains much beyond 1.2400 in early EU trade. Indeed, Cable subsequently slumped towards 1.2200 in contrast to Nzd/Usd that has regrouped after a slide through 0.5950 in wake of the RBNZ’s 75 bp OCR ease to approach 0.6100, as Aud/Nzd crosses 1.0050 following latest RBA repo and bank liquidity projections. The latter pairing&nbsp; may be gearing up for something bigger from the RBA this Thursday after forward guidance overnight flagged the potential for QE given that rates are already at the lower bound. Back to Europe, Eur/Usd breached 1.1200 when the Buck was succumbing to broad selling pressure, but single currency has also conceded ground even though Eurozone bonds are sharply underperforming post-ECB and amidst more fiscal stimulus into today’s Eurogroup meeting.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not much respite for the forlorn Norwegian Crown after hitting fresh record lows vs the Euro circa 11.5865, but a rebound in crude prices following reports that the US could top up its SPR by some 75-77 mn brls has seen the cross drift back down through 11.5000. Conversely, dovish talk and actual action from the likes of the NBH and CNB respectively (latter lowering rates by ½ point and keeping the door ajar for more) merely piled more pressure on the Forint and Koruna. Elsewhere, other oil and commodity-linked currencies were also hit hard, like the Rub, Zar, Mxn, while the Brl was also cautious in the run up to the BCB policy meeting on Wednesday. On that note, the SARB, CBR and CBRT are also all scheduled to deliver rate decisions this week, assuming no emergency or pre-meeting moves if course.</p>",

This followed the national emergency declaration by US President Trump last Friday which opens access to USD 50bln of emergency funds for states to tackle the coronavirus, while BoC and RBNZ also recently announced emergency cuts of 50bps and 75bps respectively. Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (-9.7%)</strong> failed to benefit from the global policy measures and announcement the RBA stands ready to purchase government bonds, with heavy losses in mining names, financials and industrials resulting the index’s worst ever drop, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.6%)</strong> was choppy amid the BoJ’s emergency meeting in which it kept rates and the yield target unchanged but doubled ETF and J-REIT purchases. <strong>Hang Seng (-4%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-3.4%)</strong> were both negative due to widespread fears and after surprise contractions to Chinese Industrial Production (-13.5% vs. Exp. 1.5%) and Retail Sales (-20.5% vs. Exp. 0.8%), but with losses in the mainland stemmed after the PBoC’s recent targeted RRR cuts of 50bps-100bps and additional 100bps cut for joint-stock banks which will unleash CNY 550bln of funds, while the HKMA authority also announced a rate cut in lock step with the Fed albeit to a lesser extent of just 64bps. Finally, 10yr JGBs opened lower due to the after-hours slump on Friday as stock markets found some firm but brief relief, although JGB prices rebounded off their lows as fears returned to the fore of investors’ minds before retreating again after the BoJ announced to keep main policy settings unchanged but instead boosted purchases of ETFs, J-REIT, Commercial Paper and Corporate Bonds, while pressure was also seen in the Australian 10yr yield after the RBA signalled a readiness to purchase government bonds.</p><p>PBoC conducted CNY 100bln in 1yr MLF operations at 3.15% vs. Prev. 3.15%.

The downbeat sentiment from the APAC session reverberated into Europe as the underlying coronavirus theme further crystallises, which saw US equity futures hit the 5% limit down at the open and hover at the levels during European trade thus far (Full details available here). Meanwhile, Euronext stated that it will be doubling the ETF threshold amid “exceptional market conditions caused by recent news and events”, with the normal threshold set to return once condition return back to normal. Sector-wise, the usual suspects show underperformance – Financials (-9.6%) sink as banks bear the brunt of the lower yield environment, whilst Consumer Discretionary (-9.3%) follow closely amid a further deterioration in Travel &amp; Leisure (-18.0%) in light of renewed fleet groundings in airline and cruise names. On that front, Air France-KLM (-16.7%) remains a laggard in the Stoxx 600 after noting that flight activity will be reduced significantly over the next few days, with the number of seats available per km seen dropping between 70-90%. easyJet (-21.0%) meanwhile stated that it has taken on further cancellations, with these actions to continue for the foreseeable future. Tui (-30.0%) plumbed the depths following after withdrawing its FY20 guidance and applying for state aid to support the business. Credit Suisse (-12.0%) shares feel extra pressure after US prosecutors are pursuing the Co. for its role in a USD 2bln Mozambieq corruption case, in which they believe that they have enough evidence against the Co.

Indeed, the DXY is only just off its pre-weekend low of 97.335 within a 97.446-98.473 range after the Fed’s latest intermeeting policy action (-100 bp FF cut to 0-0.25% and Usd700 bn QE) as the US Treasury curve unwinds some of its initial bull-steepening.</p><p>CAD/NZD/AUD - As noted above, the Loonie, Kiwi and Aussie are all conceding ground to their US counterpart in wake of various forms of stimulus designed to protect respective economies from further COVID-19 contagion, including a standard 50 bp BoC rate cut (on top of the ½ point reduction at the scheduled March meeting), -75 bp from the RBNZ and the RBA introducing more repos ahead of additional ‘measures’ to come on Thursday that may involve some for of asset purchases. Usd/Cad is back up near 1.3900, Nzd/Usd is straddling 0.6000 within a wide 0.6153-0.5945 band and Aud/Usd is hovering around 0.6170 between 0.6303-0.6097 parameters, with the latter also taking on board extremely bleak Chinese data (ip and retail sales) that is keeping Usd/CNH afloat on the 7.0000 handle.</p><p>JPY/CHF/EUR - It’s abundantly evident that safe-haven appeal is considerably stronger than any negativity associated with looser monetary policy or the prospect in the case of the Yen and Franc that have both strengthened vs the Buck and generally. Usd/Jpy has retreated through 106.00 from almost 108.00, while Usd/Chf has tested 0.9400, with Eur/Jpy and Eur/Chf eyeing 118.00 and sub-1.0550 respectively even though the single currency is outpacing the Usd either side of 1.1200. To recap, the BoJ joined others in the fight against nCoV via increased QE, while the clock is ticking down to the SNB’s quarterly policy review this Thursday and latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest more intervention. For its part, ECB’s Holzmann has reiterated that the GC is willing to do more after last week’s targeted measures.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM - </strong>As usual when oil and other commodities (Gold also) succumb to broad and severe risk-off positioning, the Nok, Rub, Mxn and Zar tend to get hit harder than most and today is no exception, albeit with crude prices not quite experiencing the near panic selling/liquidation seen this time last week. However, many regional currencies are at fresh record or multi-year lows and only being propped by intervention, like the Ils to name just one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to last Monday, bonds are markedly mixed with the Eurozone debt futures all under pressure and not seeing any real safe-haven flight in contrast to <strong>Gilts</strong> that are holding above parity and 136.00, albeit off 136.24 at best, and <strong>USTs</strong> maintaining a firm underlying bid, but again some distance from overnight session highs forged on the Fed’s much more aggressive policy moves late last Friday. Ahead, NY Fed manufacturing to provide some, passing diversion from the ongoing coronavirus vigil.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures continue to deteriorate amid further materialisation in coronavirus woes, and with further cancellations in the Travel and Leisure sector dampening demand growth in the complex. <strong>WTI</strong> Apr’20 dipped below USD 30/bbl at the open of electronic trade before taking multiple stabs at the level to the downside since Europe entered the market, although giving up the handle at the time of writing. Meanwhile, <strong>Brent</strong> May’20 underperforms its US counterpart with the prospect of the OPEC breakdown further weighing on the contract - Brent gapped lower to sub-40/bbl vs. Friday’s close of ~USD 45/bbl. Analysts at ING state that the underperformance doesn’t come as too much of a surprise “given the severity of the breakout across Europe, along with the action taken by governments to try to contain the virus”. The Dutch bank also suggests that the current weakness in oil prices is likely to persist through Q2 this year as the surge in supply and demand hit means that the markets will likely see a significant surplus. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> (-1.8%) trades weaker as investors flee for cash holdings amid significant losses in riskier assets, traders also note that a decline below USD 1500/oz may induce a stop-chase, with the yellow metal’s 200DMA ~1500.25/oz and a Fib level at USD 1495.96/oz. On that front, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>silver</strong> (-10.7%) slid since the open and briefly fell south of USD 13/oz to levels last seen in 2009. Similarly, the flight to cash and a significant slump in Chinese IP figures have prompted <strong>copper</strong> prices to crash from ~USD 2.55/lb to sub USD 2.40/lb.</p><p><strong>OPEC/OPEC+ JTC meeting planned for March 18th in Vienna has been cancelled, sources state.

To recap, the BoJ joined others in the fight against nCoV via increased QE, while the clock is ticking down to the SNB’s quarterly policy review this Thursday and latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest more intervention. For its part, ECB’s Holzmann has reiterated that the GC is willing to do more after last week’s targeted measures.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - As usual when oil and other commodities (Gold also) succumb to broad and severe risk-off positioning, the Nok, Rub, Mxn and Zar tend to get hit harder than most and today is no exception, albeit with crude prices not quite experiencing the near panic selling/liquidation seen this time last week. However, many regional currencies are at fresh record or multi-year lows and only being propped by intervention, like the Ils to name just one.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to last Monday, bonds are markedly mixed with the Eurozone debt futures all under pressure and not seeing any real safe-haven flight in contrast to <strong>Gilts</strong> that are holding above parity and 136.00, albeit off 136.24 at best, and <strong>USTs</strong> maintaining a firm underlying bid, but again some distance from overnight session highs forged on the Fed’s much more aggressive policy moves late last Friday.

Meanwhile, <strong>Brent</strong> May’20 underperforms its US counterpart with the prospect of the OPEC breakdown further weighing on the contract - Brent gapped lower to sub-40/bbl vs. Friday’s close of ~USD 45/bbl. Analysts at ING state that the underperformance doesn’t come as too much of a surprise “given the severity of the breakout across Europe, along with the action taken by governments to try to contain the virus”. The Dutch bank also suggests that the current weakness in oil prices is likely to persist through Q2 this year as the surge in supply and demand hit means that the markets will likely see a significant surplus. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> (-1.8%) trades weaker as investors flee for cash holdings amid significant losses in riskier assets, traders also note that a decline below USD 1500/oz may induce a stop-chase, with the yellow metal’s 200DMA ~1500.25/oz and a Fib level at USD 1495.96/oz. On that front, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>silver</strong> (-10.7%) slid since the open and briefly fell south of USD 13/oz to levels last seen in 2009. Similarly, the flight to cash and a significant slump in Chinese IP figures have prompted <strong>copper</strong> prices to crash from ~USD 2.55/lb to sub USD 2.40/lb.</p>",

Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>is only just off its pre-weekend low of 97.335 within a 97.446-98.473 range after the Fed’s latest intermeeting policy action (-100 bp FF cut to 0-0.25% and Usd700 bn QE) as the US Treasury curve unwinds some of its initial bull-steepening.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Loonie, Kiwi and Aussie are all conceding ground to their US counterpart in wake of various forms of stimulus designed to protect respective economies from further COVID-19 contagion, including a standard 50 bp BoC rate cut (on top of the ½ point reduction at the scheduled March meeting), -75 bp from the RBNZ and the RBA introducing more repos ahead of additional ‘measures’ to come on Thursday that may involve some for of asset purchases. Usd/Cad is back up near 1.3900, Nzd/Usd is straddling 0.6000 within a wide 0.6153-0.5945 band and Aud/Usd is hovering around 0.6170 between 0.6303-0.6097 parameters, with the latter also taking on board extremely bleak Chinese data (ip and retail sales) that is keeping Usd/<strong>CNH </strong>afloat on the 7.0000 handle.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s abundantly evident that safe-haven appeal is considerably stronger than any negativity associated with looser monetary policy or the prospect in the case of the Yen and Franc that have both strengthened vs the Buck and generally. Usd/Jpy has retreated through 106.00 from almost 108.00, while Usd/Chf has tested 0.9400, with Eur/Jpy and Eur/Chf eyeing 118.00 and sub-1.0550 respectively even though the single currency is outpacing the Usd either side of 1.1200. To recap, the BoJ joined others in the fight against nCoV via increased QE, while the clock is ticking down to the SNB’s quarterly policy review this Thursday and latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest more intervention.

This followed the national emergency declaration by US President Trump last Friday which opens access to USD 50bln of emergency funds for states to tackle the coronavirus, while BoC and RBNZ also recently announced emergency cuts of 50bps and 75bps respectively. Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (-9.7%)</strong> failed to benefit from the global policy measures and announcement the RBA stands ready to purchase government bonds, with heavy losses in mining names, financials and industrials resulting the index’s worst ever drop, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.5%)</strong> was choppy amid the BoJ’s emergency meeting in which it kept rates and the yield target unchanged but doubled ETF and J-REIT purchases. <strong>Hang Seng (-3.8%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.8%)</strong> were both negative due to widespread fears and after surprise contractions to Chinese Industrial Production (-13.5% vs. Exp. 1.5%) and Retail Sales (-20.5% vs. Exp. 0.8%), but with losses in the mainland stemmed after the PBoC’s recent targeted RRR cuts of 50bps-100bps and additional 100bps cut for joint-stock banks which will unleash CNY 550bln of funds, while the HKMA authority also announced a rate cut in lock step with the Fed albeit to a lesser extent of just 64bps. Finally, 10yr JGBs opened lower due to the after-hours slump on Friday as stock markets found some firm but brief relief, although JGB prices rebounded off their lows as fears returned to the fore of investors’ minds before retreating again after the BoJ announced to keep main policy settings unchanged but instead boosted purchases of ETFs, J-REIT, Commercial Paper and Corporate Bonds, while pressure was also seen in the Australian 10yr yield after the RBA signalled a readiness to purchase government bonds.</p><p>PBoC conducted CNY 100bln in 1yr MLF operations at 3.15% vs. Prev. 3.15%.

Furthermore, Fed Chair Powell commented during the conference call that the Fed doesn't see negative rates as an appropriate policy response in the US but suggested the Fed has plenty of policy space and that fiscal policy should also play a major role. The Fed’s move to the zero-lower bound briefly underpinned the greenback’s major counterparts although the upside in <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> proved to be short-lived after hitting resistance at the 1.1200 handle and with both Spain and France joining the bloc’s widening lockdown, while the upside in <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also stalled after failing to breach 1.2400. Elsewhere, the risk averse flows saw <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> attempted a breakdown of the 106.00 level where support eventually held as markets await the conclusion of the BoJ’s emergency meeting which was later perceived as somewhat of a disappointment, and <strong>antipodeans</strong> were lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses and following the abysmal Chinese data releases, as well as the RBNZ’s 75bps emergency rate cut and RBA signalling it is prepared to conduct government bond purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mostly lacklustre in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures briefly slipped to below the USD 30/bbl level despite the Fed’s efforts to contain the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak with an emergency 100bps cut and USD 700bln of QE, as the drastic measures and increased global shutdowns/lockdown stoked market disarray, and although there were recent reports President Trump asked the energy department to purchase oil through the SPR amid current&nbsp; low price environment, Goldman Sachs remained cynical on the effects this would have to stem the risks of further weakness. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> only saw limited gains despite the risk averse tone and weaker greenback following the Fed’s 100bps cut and QE announcement, while copper deteriorated in tandem with the broad risk-aversion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>US President Trump asked the energy department to purchase oil through for the SPR and said they will it \"will fill it to the top”. (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs said SPR purchases could raise equilibrium price where global oil market rebalances by USD 2/bbl, but added that SPR purchases could be insufficient to reverse increasingly likely risk prices decline beneath Q2-Q3 USD 30/bbl Brent forecast to cash costs. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>The TPLEX bear steepened again on Friday amid a renewed risk appetite. The Treasury selling coincided with strength in equities, following on from Thursday where both were sold amid a flight to cash. It is possible that the move in government debt was less correlated to risk appetite and more to technical factors, such as the ongoing duration selling by risk parity-type players, as well as profit taking from exhausted levels, as has broadly been suggested in recent sessions. The TPLEX did find a bid after the NY Fed stepped into move forward its Treasury purchase schedule, although it ultimately proved short-lived, as the selling pressures resumed heading into settlement. The 10-year yield rose by around 9bps to just over 0.94%, while the 2-year yield remained unchanged at 0.48%. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point 3 ticks lower at 135-25+.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said there is an agreement on the virus package and that he doesn’t anticipate the coronavirus pandemic to tip the economy into recession, while expects there will be a big rebound later in the year.

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia-Pac stocks decline and US equity futures hit limit down as COVID-19 continues to take its toll despite emergency policy action including a 100bps cut and QE by the Fed",
        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower and US equity futures hit limit down to start the week as coronavirus fears and disruptions continued to spook investor sentiment, despite numerous policy measures to address the fallout from the outbreak including the Fed throwing the kitchen sink with a 100bps emergency cut and USD 700bln QE announcement. This followed the national emergency declaration by US President Trump last Friday which opens access to USD 50bln of emergency funds for states to tackle the coronavirus, while BoC and RBNZ also recently announced emergency cuts of 50bps and 75bps respectively. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-7.2%) failed to benefit from the global policy measures and announcement the RBA stands ready to purchase government bonds, with heavy losses in mining names, financials and industrials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is choppy as better than expected Machinery Orders and news the BoJ is to bring forward this week’s meeting by conducting a 1-day emergency meeting today, is offset by the safe-haven flows into the JPY. Hang Seng (-2.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are both negative amid the widespread fears and following significant surprise contractions to Chinese Industrial Production (-13.5% vs. Exp. 1.5%) and Retail Sales (-20.5% vs. Exp. 0.8%), but with losses in the mainland stemmed after the PBoC’s recent targeted RRR cuts of 50bps-100bps and additional 100bps cut for joint-stock banks which will unleash CNY 550bln of funds, while the HKMA authority also announced a rate cut in lock step with the Fed albeit to a lesser extent of just 64bps.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY briefly dropped below 98.00 after the Fed’s 100bps emergency rate cut and QE announcement in which it will increase Treasury purchases by at least USD 500bln and MBS purchases by USD 200bln, with the Fed expecting target interest rates to remain in this range until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to meet inflation and employment targets. Furthermore, Fed Chair Powell commented during the conference call that the Fed doesn't see negative rates as an appropriate policy response in the US but suggested the Fed has plenty of policy space and that fiscal policy should also play a major role. The Fed’s move to the zero-lower bound briefly underpinned the greenback’s major counterparts although the upside in EUR/USD proved to be short-lived after hitting resistance at the 1.1200 handle and with both Spain and France joining the bloc’s widening lockdown, while the upside in GBP/USD also stalled after failing to breach 1.2400. Elsewhere, the risk averse flows saw USD/JPY attempt a breakdown of the 106.00 level where support eventually held as markets await the conclusion of the BoJ’s emergency meeting, and antipodeans are lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses and following the abysmal Chinese data releases.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs opened lower due to the after-hours slump on Friday as stock markets found some firm but brief relief, although JGB prices have rebounded off their lows as fears returned to the fore of investors’ minds and with participants awaiting the BoJ announcement, while pressure was also seen in the Australian 10yr yield after the RBA signalled a readiness to purchase government bonds.</p>",
