Following this, 16 cities have been quarantined and travel out of the provinces has been restricted.<strong> </strong>The 16 cities equate to 46mln citizens, or 3% of China’s population. The cases continued to spread with now over 900 cases confirmed, with the death toll picking up to 24 in China, according to Global Times, with the first death confirmed outsider of the epicentre. In the US, NY Governor Cuomo announced that there are 4 suspected cases in the US, however 1 has been declared negative, whilst the other three are still awaiting results. Europe saw its first confirmed case as the French Health Minister announced one in Bordeaux, France, while also declaring a second case around Paris. The spreading of the virus continued to spook markets with a flight to quality being seen, sending spot gold above 1570, and TYH0 back above the 130-00 figure, and further to 130-10, whilst risk assets were offered, particularly equities.</p><p><strong>* US MARKIT PMI: </strong>Manufacturing printed 51.7 against an expected 52.5 (Prev. 52.4), while services printed 53.2 against an expected 52.9 (Prev. 52.8); this left the composite at 53.1 from 52.7. Markit said that the recovery of growth momentum across the US private services sector continues to quicken, with overall output rising at the best rate since March. \"Nonetheless, the underlying data highlights a manufacturing sector that is not out of the woods yet, with goods producers seeing only modest gains in output and new orders. Although firms remain wary of the potential for headwinds through&nbsp; 2020, business confidence creeped higher for the second month running,\" Markit said, \"further signs of historically soft price pressures will come as no surprise to the FOMC, which meets next week, adding to expectations of a hold in the policy rate.\"</p><p><strong>* UK MARKIT PMI SURVEYS: </strong>The UK Markit PMI data was looked at to help tilt the direction of next week's MPC, after the solid jobs data earlier in the week saw a hawkish repricing of BOE expectations. However, despite the upside surprise, the probability of a cut is still around 50%, UBS says the decision remains a coin toss, as there is still the question as to why four MPC members in quick succession delivered such dovish market comments. The MPC will have more information about what has or has not happened so far in 2020 than the market, UBS says. Other traders noted that the MPC does not look at one month’s data in isolation, it takes into account a wider view; and these risks are clear. There is still a chance that the UK/EU do not complete a trade deal by the end of the year; the EU, in wanting to maintain its negotiating hand, wants to discuss goods before financial sector in the negotiations, while the UK wants the opposite. It keeps the prospect of a no deal alive, and thus, the MPC is still likely to be cautious.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>* EUROZONE MARKIT PMI SURVEYS: </strong>Despite a solid rise in the German manufacturing PMIs, the aggregate EZ composite PMI was unchanged in January at 50.9, missing the consensus 51.2, with survey compiler Markit noting that \"combined growth of the ‘big-2’ eurozone economies picked up, but this was offset by near-stagnation across the rest of the single-currency area.\" Markit also said that, nevertheless, overall the reading presented a stable picture for both growth, and inflation will likely reassure the ECB that it is safe to keep monpol settings fixed for now while carrying out a strategy review.</p><p><strong>* CANADA RETAIL SALES: </strong>Canadian retail sales rose 0.9% M/M in November (exp. +0.4%), snapping a run of softer data for the month. \"It would take more reports like this one to really alter what have been lackluster trends in the retail sector, though,\" RBC said. The bank argues that consumer spending trends have probably been better than the data implies, noting that the retail sales numbers do not include spending on services, which amounts to more than half of consumer spending. Additionally, RBC says that the headline retail sales numbers also exclude a portion of e-commerce sales, which slowed in November but are still running stronger than headline retail sales at +6.6% Y/Y in November. \"Still, domestic growth concerns are once again front and center at the BoC, despite what looks like a less-worrying external backdrop with the US and China agreeing to hit pause in their ongoing trade war,\" the bank says adding, \"overall economic activity looks like it increased little if at all in Q4\" [note: November GDP data released next week]. As BOE Governor Poloz has said, some softness in the domestic economic can be attributed to transitory factors. RBC concludes that the BOC will rightly be more focused on economic data releases until it becomes clear whether recent faltering is a sign of underlying fundamental deterioration, or yet another statistical blip in what often volatile Canadian economic data is.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.40 LOWER AT USD 54.19/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 1.35 LOWER AT USD 60.69/BBL:</strong> Crude products sold off heavily throughout the session as supply glut worries increase as Coronavirus cases continue to spread and as China shut off public transport out of 16 cities in an effort to contain the virus. The selloff continued throughout the whole session and knocked out support levels at 55.55/45 and 62.11/61.97 in WTI and Brent respectively, as highlighted by PVM. As the decline exacerbated WTI hit levels not seen since November 2019, printing a low of 53.85/bbl, and Brent fell to levels not seen since early December. Elsewhere, source reports in Tass stated OPEC+ have discussed an output cut extension until the end of 2020, where the quotas may be reviewed in June whilst adding OPEC+ are unlikely to ease cuts in March as markets are still bearish. The latest baker hughes rig count data added oil rigs for the second week in a row, rising 3 to 676, natgas -5 at 115 and total was -2 at 794, bringing the total to 794.</p><p>*<strong> US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 16 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-09. </strong>The TPLEX was bid on Friday, particularly in the long end, as risk appetite dissolved due to the ongoing coronavirus. The move higher in the T-Note coincided with Spoos being offered (falling beneath 3200) in the latter part of the European session, the move lower in yields was exacerbated following the US PMIs, which were by no means disastrous, appeared more of an obstacle for participants to get out the way before moving into Treasuries ahead of the weekend – where concerns linger on the threats posed globally by the coronavirus. Note that some heavy block trades were noted after the T-Note passed the 130-00 level; some analysts note a slew of short covering as prices move closer to concentrated option strikes, specifically 130-16 and 130-25, although the key 1.67% figure in the 10-year yield served as resistance for the benchmark, but loomed close in the tail end of the day. By settlement, the Treasury curve had bull-flattened, where the 2s10s fell just beneath the 20bps figure: 2-year yield down 2bps and 10-year yield down 5bps.</p><p><strong>* STOCK CLOSES: </strong>SPX -0.90% AT 3295; DOW -0.58% AT 28990; NDX -0.82% AT 9141</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Intel (INTC) reported s stellar quarter and guidance, with strong growth in its cloud and data centre unit, seeing the stock surge, as well as supporting competitors such as Nvidia (NVDA). American Express (AXP) was another top Dow performer after beating top and bottom, helped by allow tax rate, in addition to firm guidance. Discover Financial Services (DFS) took a double-digit haircut as investors balked at its large rise in net charge offs. Skyworks (SWKS) beat on earnings and guidance but was offered on the Broadcom (AVGO) and Apple (AAPL) deal. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) traded in the red in what appeared to be a sell-the-news reaction after its strong preliminary revenue report last week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) was also sold, where it missed on EPS and its NII/NIM was a touch light. Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD) was an outperformer after beating profit and revenue estimates with strong total volume growth, despite weak Q2 guidance. Atlassian (TEAM) surged on strong results and guidance.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing (BA) reversed its losses after the FAA suggested that mid-year 737 MAX approval timeline was “conservative”. Broadcom (AVGO) made solid gains after it entered a multi-year supply contract with Apple (AAPL), leading to losses in Skyworks (SWKS) as pessimism grew on how much iPhone-related business it can now tap. Also for Broadcom, Skyworks and Qorvo (QRVO) are reportedly mulling bids for its wireless chip RF business, in a deal that could fetch USD 10bln. Walt Disney (DIS) underperformed amid it shutting its Shanghai resort due to the coronavirus. Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) were victims to a negative mention at JPMorgan, suggesting a weak outlook for the pair’s profits in 2020.</p><p><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP: </strong>Preliminary PMIs, mixed CB vibes and China’s coronavirus.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY looks set to end Friday’s (EU) session near best levels within a 97.390-927 range having spent the bulk of the week tethered around 97.500 and largely taking cues from elsewhere given a lack of top tier US data or specifics. Note, initial claims and existing home sales were mildly supportive, with the former for January’s NFP survey week, while Markit PMIs were mixed and hardly impacted. Instead, China’s latest health crisis and the spread of the deadly coronavirus has been a constant theme and risk sentiment driver, along with moves in counterpart currencies on a variety of general and independent factors.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Although off best levels across the board, the Pound remains on course for net gains on the back of markedly reduced BoE rate cut expectations due to a healthy snapshot of the UK labour market, upbeat CBI industrial trends survey and encouraging IHS PMIs. Recall, last week’s macro news was almost entirely bleak in comparison and combined with a string of dovish sounding MPC speakers the probability of a 25 bp ease next week peaked over 70%, but the odds are now roughly even. Cable is currently hovering around one full point above a circa 1.2960 base, while Eur/Gbp is rooted ear the bottom of a 0.8390-0.8554 range.</p><p><strong>* CAD/NOK/EUR/JPY: </strong>Aside from the aforementioned overall swings been risk appetite and aversion, largely on Chinese outbreak and contamination well beyond the source in Wuhan, the Yen, Loonie, Norwegian Krona and Euro all had policy meetings to contend with. First up, the BoJ and no change in any of the policy metrics or commentary from Governor Kuroda, as minor upgrades to growth forecasts were offset by softer inflation projections. Hence, the Yen was left to track broad mood swings, US Treasury yields vs JGBs and mainly Yuan moves inversely as Usd/Cnh climbed from 6.8455 or so to 6..9400+ before fading and Usd/Jpy descended to 109.25 from 110.21. Next the BoC, and a semi-surprise dovish message/less confident assessment and outlook nudging the rate cut door ajar, with Governor Poloz revealing that an ease was discussed at the first gathering in 2020, but not delivered on the premise that it would be better to wait for more data rather than act in haste. Usd/Cad hit highs just shy of the 100 DMA (1.3179) vs a weekly low of 1.3036, but recouped some losses and maintained recovery momentum with the aid of above consensus headline Canadian retail sales (over an ex-auto miss). Conversely, the Norges Bank retained a neutral/on hold bias against some speculation for a dovish twist and irrespective of a deterioration in industrial sentiment and sliding crude prices (partly on the projected demand destruction if the coronavirus reaches epidemic proportions, and as more ME output comes back on line). Eur/Nok presently hovering around 9.9650 vs sub-9.8700 at the low even though Eur/Usd is sitting only a few pips off its weekly trough around 1.1025 compared to nearly 1.1120 at the other extreme in wake of January’s ECB confab and 2nd press conference from new President Lagarde. In sum, benchmark rates, QE and guidance were all unchanged due to a not dissimilar assessment of risks and the inflation outlook, bar a nod to stabilisation in some indicators and measures of underlying inflation. Meanwhile, the strategic review was officially launched, but is anticipated to take at least a year and the only details published were the aims of the project, and mostly better than previous or forecast Eurozone PMIs were largely shrugged off.</p><p><strong>* NZD/CHF/AUD: </strong>Also subject to Central Bank impulses, but not emanating from scheduled policy meets or events. The Kiwi has held up better than its Antipodean peer on firmer than anticipated NZ Q4 CPI that pushed RBNZ rate cut estimates back, but contagion and fall-out from China has undermined the Aussie following decent jobs data that also prompted several banks to roll back RBA stimulus calls. Conversely, the SNB reinforced the need for NIRP and direct intervention to curb Franc strength/demand as it is still deemed highly valued and chief Jordan added that rates may even need to be cut further after echoing Maechler in stressing that becoming one of the countries labelled by the US as a currency manipulator will not impact their policy actions or approach.</p><p><strong>* EM: </strong>In keeping with the Yuan’s reversal from recent peaks, regional currencies have depreciated vs the Greenback, with some extra bearish catalysts for the Lira, Real and Rand coming from Turkey’s Finance Minister and Brazil’s Economy effective espousing the benefits of a weaker Try and Brl, while the Zar was not helped by more cash and power shortages for SAA and Eskom.</p>",

WTI hit levels not seen since November 2019, printing a low of 53.85, and Brent fell to levels not seen since early December. Elsewhere, source reports in Tass stated OPEC+ have discussed an output cut extension until the end of 2020, where the quotas may be reviewed in June whilst adding OPEC+ are unlikely to ease cuts in March as markets are still bearish.

The Coronavirus, however, has seen Chinese authorities effectively quarantine some major cities, including Wuhan where the virus is said to have started, Temples, malls, and entertainment spaces have been shut, amid the 1000+ suspected cases just in China. The timing is not particularly great for the Chinese economy – the Lunar New Year is comparable to Christmas Holidays in the West. The WHO has stopped short of declaring a world emergency, which led to some relief for risk assets. S&amp;P has said that if the situation were to deteriorate considerably, it has the potential to chop 1.2ppts off Chinese growth in 2020 (in 2019, the nation’s economy grew by 6.1%). Rabobank says that, rather than viewing officials’ moves as promising to limit the spread of the contagion, the market is judging it as reflective of the severity of the threat. While the SARS virus in 2003 is an obvious reference point, the situation is not identical. For instance, the mortality rate is lower in Coronavirus than SARS was; additionally, the response from the Chinese government has been quicker, and has coordinated with other bodies more efficiently. And even in terms of the impact, China now accounts for a much larger share of global GDP growth (Rabo says 15.8% in 2018 vs 4.3% in 2003; additionally, China’s post crisis debt binge since the crisis has seen it account for 50% of global growth since 2008).&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>looks set to end Friday’s (EU) session near best levels within a 97.390-927 range having spent the bulk of the week tethered around 97.500 and largely taking cues from elsewhere given a lack of top tier US data or specifics. Note, initial claims and existing home sales were mildly supportive, with the former for January’s NFP survey week, while Markit PMIs were mixed and hardly impacted. Instead, China’s latest health crisis and the spread of the deadly coronavirus has been a constant theme and risk sentiment driver, along with moves in counterpart currencies on a variety of general and independent factors.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although off best levels across the board, the Pound remains on course for net gains on the back of markedly reduced BoE rate cut expectations due to a healthy snapshot of the UK labour market, upbeat CBI industrial trends survey and encouraging IHS PMIs. Recall, last week’s macro news was almost entirely bleak in comparison and combined with a string of dovish sounding MPC speakers the probability of a 25 bp ease next week peaked over 70%, but the odds are now roughly even. Cable is currently hovering around one full point above a circa 1.2960 base, while Eur/Gbp is rooted ear the bottom of a 0.8390-0.8554 range.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>Aside from the aforementioned overall swings been risk appetite and aversion, largely on Chinese outbreak and contamination well beyond the source in Wuhan, the Yen, Loonie, Norwegian Krona and Euro all had policy meetings to contend with. First up, the BoJ and no change in any of the policy metrics or commentary from Governor Kuroda, as minor upgrades to growth forecasts were offset by softer inflation projections. Hence, the Yen was left to track broad mood swings, US Treasury yields vs JGBs and mainly Yuan moves inversely as Usd/Cnh climbed from 6.8455 or so to 6..9400+ before fading and Usd/Jpy descended to 109.25 from 110.21. Next the BoC, and a semi-surprise dovish message/less confident assessment and outlook nudging the rate cut door ajar, with Governor Poloz revealing that an ease was discussed at the first gathering in 2020, but not delivered on the premise that it would be better to wait for more data rather than act in haste. Usd/Cad hit highs just shy of the 100 DMA (1.3179) vs a weekly low of 1.3036, but recouped some losses and maintained recovery momentum with the aid of above consensus headline Canadian retail sales (over an ex-auto miss). Conversely, the Norges Bank retained a neutral/on hold bias against some speculation for a dovish twist and irrespective of a deterioration in industrial sentiment and sliding crude prices (partly on the projected demand destruction if the coronavirus reaches epidemic proportions, and as more ME output comes back on line). Eur/Nok presently hovering around 9.9650 vs sub-9.8700 at the low even though Eur/Usd is sitting only a few pips off its weekly trough around 1.1025 compared to nearly 1.1120 at the other extreme in wake of January’s ECB confab and 2nd press conference from new President Lagarde. In sum, benchmark rates, QE and guidance were all unchanged due to a not dissimilar assessment of risks and the inflation outlook, bar a nod to stabilisation in some indicators and measures of underlying inflation. Meanwhile, the strategic review was officially launched, but is anticipated to take at least a year and the only details published were the aims of the project, and mostly better than previous or forecast Eurozone PMIs were largely shrugged off.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/AUD</strong></p><p>Also subject to Central Bank impulses, but not emanating from scheduled policy meets or events. The Kiwi has held up better than its Antipodean peer on firmer than anticipated NZ Q4 CPI that pushed RBNZ rate cut estimates back, but contagion and fall-out from China has undermined the Aussie following decent jobs data that also prompted several banks to roll back RBA stimulus calls. Conversely, the SNB reinforced the need for NIRP and direct intervention to curb Franc strength/demand as it is still deemed highly valued and chief Jordan added that rates may even need to be cut further after echoing Maechler in stressing that becoming one of the countries labelled by the US as a currency manipulator will not impact their policy actions or approach.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In keeping with the Yuan’s reversal from recent peaks, regional currencies have depreciated vs the Greenback, with some extra bearish catalysts for the Lira, Real and Rand coming from Turkey’s Finance Minister and Brazil’s Economy effective espousing the benefits of a weaker Try and Brl, while the Zar was not helped by more cash and power shortages for SAA and Eskom.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Price action post-UK PMIs could be construed as a classic case of ‘buy the rumour/sell the fact’, but the sheer scale of Sterling’s fall from grace smacks of something else, or coincidental. Indeed, Cable collapsed from 1.3170+ to 1.3085 having rallied ahead of the IHS surveys to circa 1.3155 even though the headline reads for manufacturing, services and composite all beat consensus comfortably and the compiler contended that this this would likely keep the BoE on hold next week. However, market pricing is still close to 50-50 and the Pound’s sharp reversal came alongside a broader Dollar buying spree amidst reports that China’s coronavirus has now spread to all but just 2 of the country’s 31 regions. Usd/<strong>CNH</strong> rebounded towards weekly peaks in response and the <strong>DXY</strong> extended gains beyond 97.800.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The Euro has also felt the weight general Greenback demand having derived scant bullish momentum from preliminary Eurozone PMIs that were better than expected on balance, and not really reacting to more ECB rhetoric from President Lagarde plus GC members that were largely reiterations of yesterday’s post-policy meeting statements and the official strategic review launch text. Eur/Usd is now just off a marginal new sub-1.1035 low, but Eur/Gbp has rebounded through 0.8400 on the back of Sterling’s much deeper pull-back.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/JPY/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>The Kiwi remains relatively firm/resilient in wake of NZ CPI data overnight that marginally surpassed forecasts, and the Aussie is also benefiting to a degree from another bank rolling back its RBA easing call to April from next month previously. Nzd/Usd is holding above 0.6600, while Aud/Usd keeps tabs on 0.6850 and the Yen pivots 109.50 after easing back from Thursday’s peaks near 109.25 and the 50 DMA. Elsewhere, the Loonie continues to regain composure after the BoC’s shift towards a looser policy stance, with Usd/Cad back down below 1.3150 and now looking towards Canadian retail sales data as the first release post-Wednesday’s meeting. Conversely, Usd/Chf has bounced further post-SNB verbal intervention to 0.9700+, but the Franc is still outperforming the Euro as the cross meanders between 1.0709-23.</p>",

On that note, after somewhat mixed French prints the German flash readings have surpassed expectations quite comfortably, albeit with the manufacturing sector still some way below the key 50 level. Hence, Bunds have retreated further to a 172.60 low and the 10 year UK debt future followed suit to 133.78 from 133.99 at best and yesterday’s 134.08 settlement level, but the 3 month strip is holding up better or at least flat-lining.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Today will see the latest batch of Markit PMI metrics for January with services, manufacturing and composite readings all due for release. A combination of recent data points (GDP, retail sales, CPI) and dovish interventions from MPC members (Carney, Vlieghe, Tenreyro and Saunders) has seen a significant repricing of a rate reduction for the January 30th policy announcement with markets now assigning a 56.6% chance of a 25bps cut next week. Given that the December meeting saw two dovish dissenters (Saunders and Haskel) to the unchanged consensus, a lowering of rates would only require three members of the MPC to switch camps to force a change in monetary policy. With the UK’s exit from the EU now secured (albeit concerns remain about the transition period), the near-term policy focus has largely been swayed by macroeconomic data. However, the aforementioned data points are not regarded as timely indicators and therefore today’s Markit PMI release (January) is seen to carry greater importance as it will encapsulate any so-called “Boris-bounce” following last month’s general election. At the November MPR, Governor Carney downplayed the efficacy of PMIs in their ability to generate short-term forecasting, however, given that markets have little else in the way of near-term data points to assess the UK economy, investors will likely use today’s release to try and shift market pricing decisively one way or another depending on the overall outcome of the Markit release.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed despite the mild reprieve on Wall St where most major US indices rebounded after the World Health Organization refrained from declaring the coronavirus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, while Nasdaq futures were also boosted after-hours due to Intel earnings which beat on top and bottom lines. Nonetheless, price action for Asia is cautious amid widespread closures for Lunar New Year’s Eve and with the number of infected and deaths from the coronavirus continuing to rise. ASX 200 (+0.2%) remains afloat with outperformance in Healthcare spurred by outbreak fears after further cases were reported outside of the epicenter and mainland China, while the largest weighted financials sector is also firmer amid the recent pushback in rate cut forecasts and with Macquarie underpinned on reports it is nearing a deal with Bell Financial to outsource the back office of its private wealth management business. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) largely reflects the indecision of its currency and the Hang Seng (Unch.) is subdued in today’s shortened trading session and with mainland bourses shut till next Friday, while stocks continue to be dampened by the coronavirus fears including gambling names after Macau Chief Executive Ho said they may close all casinos and have cancelled the Lunar New Year parade after a second case of the virus was recently confirmed in the special administrative region.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat but holds on to most the gains seen in the prior session after recent encouraging jobless claims figures and weakness in its transatlantic counterparts. EUR/USD was eventually pressured despite an unsurprising ECB policy announcement in which the central bank kept monetary policy settings unchanged as expected and reiterated its forward guidance on rates and asset purchases. Furthermore, ECB President Lagarde noted at the presser that monetary policy must remain highly accommodative and that data points to some stabilisation but that risks remain tilted to the downside, while GBP/USD is rangebound after having rebounded off support at 1.3100 with the pair biding its time heading into looming PMI data. USD/JPY is indecisive amid the cautious risk tone, outdated BoJ minutes and mostly inline inflation data which showed headline CPI Y/Y firmed to 0.8% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.5%) although remained below the halfway point to the 2% target. Antipodeans are varied with AUD/USD subdued after Westpac joined in on the recent pushback of RBA rate cut forecasts in which it now sees the next reduction in April instead of February, while NZD/USD is lifted on firmer than expected New Zealand CPI data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower in a continuation of yesterday’s after-hours pullback and with participants sidelined ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction.</p>",
