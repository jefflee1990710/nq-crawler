        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites down, Treasuries down, Dollar flat, Crude mixed.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> Tensions escalate between US/Iran, Semiconductor and tech sectors hit on trade war concerns, Conservatives win in Aussie election surprise, Modi to win India elections, Fed speak delivers few surprises.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>RBA May Meeting Minutes, US Existing Home Sales, EU Consumer Confidence, NZ Retail Sales, RBA’s Lowe, Fed’s Powell, Evans, Rosengren, ECB’s BoE’s Carney, ECB’s de Guindos, Riksbank’s Floden, Earnings; Home Depot</p><p><strong>* US CHINA TRADE:&nbsp; </strong>China Foreign Minister Wang told US Secretary of State Pompeo in a call that while a trade deal between the two nations is still possible, China must protect its interests. Meanwhile, the PBOC's Q1 monetary policy report continues to get attention; the report said that escalating tensions could destabilise the world economy, and the central bank pledged to continue its targeted stimulus measures while keeping the yuan stable. China Global Times Editor tweeted that the banning of Huawei is a \"turning point of the US semiconductor companies gradually losing Chinese market\".</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> After hawkish rhetoric from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard last week, US President Trump warned Iran to \"never threaten the United States again!\" US Senator Lindsey Graham later commented that, at a briefing with National Security Adviser Bolton regarding Iran, \"it is clear that over the last several weeks Iran has attacked pipelines and ships of other nations and created threat streams against American interests\" and \"if the Iranian threats against American personnel and interests are activated we must deliver an overwhelming military response,\" maintaining the tension built throughout last week. It was also reported on Monday that Iran had increased – by fourfold – its uranium enrichment process, where it notified the UN that it was disregarding the 300KG production cap specified in the previous nuclear deal, adding cadence to the US hawk view that the country poses a risk from its nuclear ambitions, a textbook line used in justification of previous US military intervention. Later reports suggested that Saudi Air Defence has intercepted two Houthi missiles in the Mecca province; the Saudis had previously accused the Houthis as being used as a proxy by Iran, who attacked its oil pumping stations last week.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK opposition leader Corbyn in an interview on Sunday moved closer to giving the UK public a vote on any Brexit deal. On the Tory leadership battle, around 60 members of the Conservative party have banded together to stop ex-Foreign Minister (and current front-runner) Boris Johnson from succeeding May and pursuing a no-deal Brexit. Mid-session, ITV’s Brand reported that Brexit indicative votes are 100% dead and buried with all focus now on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and what the government can do to get MPs on board.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s Bostic</strong> (Non-Voter, Dove) said that, as his base case, the US economy will continue to perform with solid growth this year whilst reiterating the Fed narrative that he doesn’t expect a rate cut imminently and does not see one by September, nor does he have a cutting or hiking bias at the moment. <strong>Fed's Harker</strong> (Non-voter, Dovish) commented that the US economy will not grow faster than 2% without further efforts to connect employers and labour. Fed's Bullard (Dove, Voter) said the US economy is performing quite well, but if inflation remains beneath target (at 1.6%) he would be more aggressively in favour for lowering rates. <strong>Fed's Clarida</strong> (Voter, Neutral) largely repeated comments from previous monetary policy speeches and repeated that the economy is operating at or close to the Fed's twin mandate. <strong>Fed's Williams</strong> (Voter, Neutral) commented that policy makers ought to maintain a strong labour market and keep inflation low and that the Fed has changed its view on how low unemployment can get without sparking inflation pressures, whilst also noting that the Fed wants to maintain the expansion as long as possible (NOTE: last week Williams suggested the Fed needed to get inflation to target, and to stay there).</p><p><strong>* PRIMER - RBA minutes overnight will likely be overshadowed Governor Lowe proceeding comments:</strong> A surprise win for the Liberal-National coalition sees AUD rise; desks remind us that RBA mins overnight are not likely to be hawkish or neutral; RBA still seen cutting its Cash Rate (given its 'tests' have already been met), perhaps as early as June, but there are now risks that if there is an upswing in the economy underpinned by tax cuts, improving business confidence as well as a better news on the property front, RBA could push any subsequent rate cut back. Participants expect the minutes to provide some \"meat on the bones\" regarding the threshold for the RBA to loosen policy (a rising unemployment rate was one of its conditions, which has been satisfied). The main event however will be the RBA Governor Lowe’s speech, entitled “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy” with some desks expecting the governor to use the speech to pave the way for rate cut in June. Westpac notes that there is an approximately 70% probability of a 25bp rate cut factored-in for the RBA’s next Board meeting on June 4. \"The market is focused on the fact that the RBA has noted that 'a further improvement in the labour market was likely needed for inflation to be consistent with the target.' With unemployment rising from 5.0% to 5.1% and now 5.2%, and underemployment near a record level, the market is convinced that there is sufficient momentum to dash the RBA’s hopes of an improvement,\" Westpac writes. \"Of course, in the communication post the May Board meeting, the Governor also stated that '…the Board will be paying close attention to developments in the labour market at its upcoming meetings'.\" Westpac says that the key question is whether the RBA will have lost patience rather than wait for further evidence over the next few months. The Federal election has also returned the incumbent Government in a surprise result. \"Given that it resolves some policy uncertainty and fears about the opposition’s potential policy impact on growth, the AUD has rallied and forward RBA pricing has been pared back slightly. Beyond that initial response, however, we see the result as ensuring “business as usual” in AU fixed income markets.\"</p><p><strong>* AUSTRIA ELECTIONS:</strong> Austrian Chancellor Kurz has signalled he is preparing for elections in September, after scandal broke over the weekend where it was revealed that Vice Chancellor Strache (who has stepped down) was filmed promising favours in exchange support and financing to win the 2017 elections. It was later reported that all ministers from the Austrian far-right were to leave the government, according to the Austrian news agency APA. As yet, Kurz is to officially decide whether he will disband the coalition and rule as a minority government or carry on. Analysts will be watching to see if this development has any implications for the European Elections (23-26 May) amid the suggestion of foreign influence benefiting far-right Parties.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) SETTLES 0.34 HIGHER AT 63.10/BBL, BRENT (N9) SETTLES 0.24 LOWER AT 71.97/BBL. </strong>The crude complex failed to hold on to its earlier surge higher on Monday as US traders took to their desks, where a bearish demand environment weighed on the bullish supply signals. Following the OPEC+ JMMC meeting over the weekend, headlines suggested members had agreed to sustained production cuts, although the stances were not that black and white. For instance, Russia did not rule out an increase in production, where Energy Minister Novak provided more neutral comments in comparison to other key members present, such as Saudi Arabia which highlighted the cartel’s consensus for sustained cuts. Nonetheless, crude legged higher on the opening of futures for the week, with bulls running on the sustained cuts and Middle East supply risk narrative. However, as the European session commenced, chatter of a breakdown in US-China trade talks catalysed a risk off sentiment seeing crude, alongside equities, retreat from highs. Elsewhere on Monday, OPEC is reportedly considering delaying the Vienna meeting from June 25th to early July; this follows reported comments from oil figureheads at the weekend JMMC meeting that more data is needed to make the decision on whether to extend the cuts, it is not specified whether this was the reason.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 2840, NASDAQ-100 -1.7% at 7377, Dow Jones -0.3% at 25680, SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.7%, Consumer Staples -0.2%, Energy 0.1%, Financials 0.1%, Health Care 0%, Industrials -0.3%, Information Technology -1.8%, Materials -1.5%, Telecommunication Services -1.2%, Utilities 0.2%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) jumped higher at the open on the news that the two telecoms cos are to offer concessions to the US Government to help secure regulatory approval for their planned merger which could include asset sales and rural-service guarantees. The two stocks later saw some downside on reports that the DoJ is to stand against the approval of the merger, but ultimately both stocks finished the session higher. Vodafone (VOD) and Verizon (VZ) moved higher in sympathy. United Parcel Services (UPS) saw some downside after reports emerged that SCOTUS denied a hearing for the co over Postal Service delivery prices. Cisco (CSCO) was unable to recover premarket losses despite news emerging that the held preliminary acquisition talks with cloud start-up HashiCorp, but did perform better than the majority of the Semiconductor sector. Nielsen (NLSN) spiked higher as news emerged that the co are said to be looked at by private equity, sources say; deal in high 20s seen as very likely, and could come in a few weeks. Apple (AAPL) opened lower after HSBC lowered its profit target for the co, citing renewed China growth risk and the negative impact of tariffs. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), ASML Holdings (ASML), Xilinx (XLNX) all opened lower as the semiconductor index suffered on renewed worries regarding the US/China trade dispute. Broadcom (AVGO) opened lower with the wider semiconductor industry, and saw further downside on reports that chip sales are being probed by the US FCC, with the probe focusing on its WiFi and Switch-Chip sales. Baidu (BIDU) took a hit as Susquehanna slashed their price target for the co.</p><p><strong>* US T-Note futures settle ticks 6+ lower at 124-09:</strong> Overnight, a better than expected Japanese GDP report for Q1 lent negative ticks in the Treasury complex, and while buyers stepped in at the European open, following more global trade tensions related news flow, the positive start for European equities capped hte Treasury upside, and futures were flat as NY entered. The complex then began its gradual drift lower, and are heading into APAC lower, led by the belly; major curve spreads were mixed into the close, but moves were +/- 1bps or so.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> was range bound through US trade, unmoved by a heavy slate of Fed speak which failed to deviate significantly from the Fed’s neutral line and cautious ahead of Wednesdays FOMC minutes; DXY hovering just below 98.00. Equally, <strong>EUR</strong> was fairly flat, if not a touch stronger vs USD, taking a similarly cautious tone ahead of this week’s ECB minutes and speakers. <strong>JPY</strong> was mixed; a decent GDP headline, though some have concerns about the composition of growth, and think some payback might be seen in quarters ahead; real exports and imports both contracted in the quarter reflecting weakness in the external environment amid slowing global demand. <strong>GBP</strong> was flat, as sterling awaits the next round of developments on the Brexit front, and various BoE speaker pencilled in for the week. <strong>AUD:</strong> surprise win for the Liberal-National coalition sees AUD rise, and attention moves now to RBA minutes overnight, as well as a speech from Governor Lowe. <strong>CNY</strong>: PBOC deputy governor Pan over the weekend said the yuan would remain stable due to sound economic fundamentals, who said that the sound and healthy operation of the Chinese economy and finance has been providing solid support for the FX market and the yuan to keep stable at a reasonable level. Although gapping higher vs USD over the weekend, USDCNY was not able to reclaim the 6.9000 level in Monday trade. <strong>INR</strong>: Exit polls have indicated that PM Modi will likely win a second term, building on his Parliamentary majority (final results due 23 May).</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>A surprise win for the Liberal-National coalition sees AUD rise; desks remind us that RBA mins overnight are not likely to be hawkish or neutral; RBA still seen cutting its Cash Rate (given its 'tests' have already been met), perhaps as early as June, but there are now risks that if there is an upswing in the economy underpinned by tax cuts, improving business confidence as well as a better news on the property front, RBA could push any subsequent rate cut back. Participants expect the minutes to provide some \"meat on the bones\" regarding the threshold for the RBA to loosen policy (a rising unemployment rate was one of its conditions, which has been satisfied).</li><li>The main event however will be the RBA Governor Lowe’s speech, entitled “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy” with some desks expecting the governor to use the speech to pave the way for rate cut in June.</li><li>Westpac notes that there is an approximately 70% probability of a 25bp rate cut factored-in for the RBA’s next Board meeting on June 4. \"The market is focused on the fact that the RBA has noted that 'a further improvement in the labour market was likely needed for inflation to be consistent with the target.' With unemployment rising from 5.0% to 5.1% and now 5.2%, and underemployment near a record level, the market is convinced that there is sufficient momentum to dash the RBA’s hopes of an improvement,\" Westpac writes. \"Of course, in the communication post the May Board meeting, the Governor also stated that '…the Board will be paying close attention to developments in the labour market at its upcoming meetings'.\"</li><li>Westpac says that the key question is whether the RBA will have lost patience rather than wait for further evidence over the next few months. The Federal election has also returned the incumbent Government in a surprise result. \"Given that it resolves some policy uncertainty and fears about the opposition’s potential policy impact on growth, the AUD has rallied and forward RBA pricing has been pared back slightly. Beyond that initial response, however, we see the result as ensuring “business as usual” in AU fixed income markets.\"</li></ul>",

Following the OPEC+ JMMC meeting over the weekend, headlines suggested members had agreed to sustained production cuts, although the stances were not that black and white. For instance, Russia did not rule out an increase in production, where Energy Minister Novak provided more neutral comments in comparison to other key members present, such as Saudi Arabia which highlighted the cartel’s consensus for sustained cuts. Nonetheless, crude legged higher on the opening of futures for the week, with bulls running on the sustained cuts and Middle East supply risk narrative. However, as the European session commenced, chatter of a breakdown in US-China trade talks catalysed a risk off sentiment seeing crude, alongside equities, retreat from highs. Elsewhere on Monday, OPEC is reportedly considering delaying the Vienna meeting from June 25th to early July; this follows reported comments from oil figureheads at the weekend JMMC meeting that more data is needed to make the decision on whether to extend the cuts, it is not specified whether this was the reason.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is consolidating after last week’s rally on upbeat surveys and some decent data, as US-China trade wars continue amidst strained relations since the end of formal talks and Washington blacklisted Huawei and ZTE. However, the <strong>DXY </strong>is holding a tight line around the 98.000 level with resistance capping the upside between 98.035-102 (Fib and mtd peak) and little on the downside below the 97.892 session low before 97.500 and then last Wednesday’s intraday base at 97.436.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The Aussie remans well ahead of its G10 peers, but has whittled overnight gains made on the surprise weekend election results that handed an unlikely victory to PM Morrison’s Liberal-led coalition as attention switches to the RBA and minutes that could add more fuel to easing expectations for next month’s policy meeting. Aud/Usd is slipping back towards 0.6900 within a 0.6938-0.6890 range and Aud/<strong>NZD</strong> is now nearer the middle of its 1.0602-1.0559 band, as the Kiwi continues track its antipodean counterpart in the absence of any real independent drivers, with Nzd/Usd meandering between 0.6550-20.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>The next best majors, with the Loonie getting a double boost from positive US-Canada-Mexico tariff reports and a rebound in oil prices. Usd/Cad has retreated further from last week’s 1.3500+ highs towards 1.3400 where bids are anticipated ahead of Canadian retail sales data on Wednesday and the return of market participants after today’s Victoria Day holiday. Meanwhile, the Franc has rebounded to circa 1.0080 from 1.0120 vs the Buck and further away from 1.1300 against the Euro, prompting some SNB acknowledgement via another reminder that intervention is an option if needed.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The laggards or at least unable to really take advantage of the Usd downturn, as Cable remains wary about Brexit and political risk and topped out short of 1.2760 before drifting back down to low 1.2720 area, while Eur/Gbp meanders between 0.8777-50 on an almost equally sluggish single currency. Indeed, Eur/Usd laboured in a tight 1.1151-69 range ahead of the EU Parliamentary elections, through yet more calls from Italy to change, loosen or scrap the fiscal rules and after Austria’s Government collapsed. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy recoiled from 110.31 to 109.81 as the broad risk mood turned sour again, and after hitting highs overnight on much better than expected Japanese GDP data.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Try has pulled up around 6.0800 and eased back towards 6.0000 following reports that the Government is ‘leaning’ on Turkish banks to support debt auctions, and despite President Erdogan hinting that S-400 missiles may be bought from Russia before July, but Usd/Brl is nudging resistance up near 4.1000 as Brazil’s Pension Head Marinho noted opposition to certain elements of the reform bill and hinted at changes to the proposal to try end ensure in passes.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>The crude complex has begun the week on the front foot with thanks to suggestions of sustained OPEC+ production cuts, in addition to the geopolitical risk premium, where President Trump recently said that any conflict with Iran would be the “official end” of that country. It is worth noting that prices have been coming off their highs previously in the session, seemingly falling in-line with revived US-China trade tensions.</li><li>After the JMMC meeting on Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said that there remained consensus among OPEC members to continue production curbs; however, Russian Energy Minister Novak seemed to suggest that other options were available in H219, including a possible raising of output levels. Novak added that if there turns out to be a shortfall in the market, then Russia would be prepared to examine options linked with a possible increase in production.</li><li>Elsewhere, the JMMC said that compliance with the supply cut deal was running at a clip of 168% in April (average compliance since January has been around 120%). Furthermore, sources noted that the Russian and Saudi oil figureheads reportedly discussed two options for June. The first scenario would see an elimination of over compliance currently over 150%, equating to an output cuts just under 2mln BPD, according to calculations. This would mean a continuation of the current deal and an increase in production of around 0.8mln BPD. The second scenario would see an ease of the agreed cuts to 0.9mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD.&nbsp; Analysts at ING do not believe that the output cut deal will continue in its current form, with their balance sheets showing “significant tightening” heading into Q3.</li><li>Baker Hughes reported US oil rigs falling to their lowest count since March 2018 for the previous week, with online rigs falling nearly 10% since their peak in November 2018. This comes amidst a more cash conscious US shale industry, “The yesteryears of credit-fuelled splurges are a thing of the past and financial discipline has taken precedence over supply growth,” analysts at PVM so eloquently note, giving credence to the supply-driven bull thesis dominating the market this year. However, PVM caveat that the Shale industry is heavily dependent on its drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), which “represent a cost-effective and readily available source of supply that can be brought online in a short amount of time,” a somewhat alternative to drilling activity.</li></ul>",

But they also seem to have cleared away their downside hedge positions (long VIX calls and shorts on US stocks) all at once as the market followed the 'sell in May' adage,\" Nomura writes, \"of course, this also means hedge funds have left themselves defenseless in the event of another sharp drop in US stocks.\" The bank also notes that it appears that the majority of hedge funds do not expect another sharp rise in volatility, and that they have concluded that the correction has run its course.</li><li>Nomura, looking at scenarios for the coming weeks and into June, says to focus on risk of market readjustment and HFs' appetite for risk. \"From that perspective, we think from here through the end of May will be an important period during which the degree of resilience of US equities and global stocks will be put to the test,\" Nomura says, \"based on the pattern in global equity sentiment and risk-parity funds' standard month-end rebalancing, we see a risk of global equities readjusting after a dead-cat bounce.\" However, nomura says that even if stock prices were to readjust, so long as hedge fund appetite for risk-taking is intact, it thinks that buying on dips may gain momentum and thereby help put the US equity and global equity markets on more solid footing in June.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>A sharp rebound from recent multi-month lows vs its US counterpart following the weekend Australian election that saw PM Morrison upset the pre-vote odds to secure a 3rd term in office and his coalition gain a majority over the Labour Party. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6900+ status in response having traded down to 0.6862 last week in wake of disappointing jobs data that heightened the prospect of a June RBA rate cut.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>The next best G10 currency as the Kiwi catches a bid on the coattails of its antipodean peer, albeit hampered by Aud/Nzd cross-flows up to 1.0600 at one stage. Nevertheless, Nzd/Usd hit a 0.6550 overnight high compared to 0.6521 at worst and last week’s 0.6512 base (Friday), as the US Dollar loses momentum broadly after its post-data/survey and China trade war related rally. On that note, the <strong>DXY</strong> has topped out just above 98.000 and ahead of resistance including a 98.035 Fib and the early May high of 98.102.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has also pared some losses partly on the aforementioned Dollar downturn, but also against a lagging Euro, with Cable bouncing off a 1.2723 trough to just over 1.2750 and Eur/Gbp easing back to 0.8750 from 0.8775. Brexit and UK political uncertainty are still to the fore, but Sterling appears to be benefiting from some short covering/profit taking alongside technical buying, with a Fib in the cross sitting at 0.8779.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also benefiting from the Buck fade, as the Franc rebounds through 1.0100 and Loonie further from 1.3500+ lows amidst more reports that a deal is done to lift US steel and aluminium tariffs. The Cad may also be gleaning traction from a post-JMMC bounce in crude prices, like the <strong>NOK</strong>, which is outperforming its Scandi rival with the Eur cross back down under 9.8000 vs Eur/Sek at 10.7600.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>As noted above, the single currency is a relative underperformer as Eur/Usd struggles to recover between 1.1168-51 parameters despite reports of bids/support at 1.1150 protecting near term support at 1.1135 and the 1.1112 ytd low. Decent option expiry interest may be keeping the headline pair in check given almost 1 bn running off from 1.1150 to 1.1160 at today’s NY cut, while chart resistance resides at 1.1190-1.1200 in the form of 100 and 200 HMAs. Meanwhile, the Yen has lost a bit more of its safe-haven allure following overnight Japanese Q1 GDP that topped consensus considerably, with Usd/Jpy up over 110.00 and as high as 110.31 at one stage.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira has failed to sustain recovery gains towards 6.0000 and higher vs the Greenback yet again after weekend comments from President Erdogan suggesting that it may bring forward its planned purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia rather than delaying the order amidst opposition and the threat of sanctions from the US.</p>",

However, core bonds and 3 month strips have succumbed to more sustained if not heavy selling pressure since, with Gilts down to 128.63 (-29 ticks), Bunds just off a 166.63 low (-43 ticks) and Short Sterling -3 ticks at worst vs +1.5 ticks earlier. No obvious catalyst for the abrupt downturn, but EU stocks are paring losses and Italian BTPs are outperforming. Ahead, no UK data, but a speech from BoE’s Broadbent after hours.</p>",

Thus, energy ministers hinted at dedication to extend the OPEC+ output pact (1.2mln BPD reduction from October levels; 0.8mln BPD from OPEC and 0.4mln BPD from its allies) past June 2019 with all eyes now set on June’s decisive meeting of the cartel.</p><p><strong>*SAUDI ARABIA</strong>: The Kingdom’s energy minister commented that global oil supply is the plentiful and recommended driving oil inventories down, but the producers will have to wait for more data before making a firm decision. OPEC sources noted that Saudi sees no need to ramp up production quickly as the Kingdom is satisfied with oil prices around USD 70/bbl.</p><p><strong>*RUSSIA:</strong> Energy minister Novak’s ambitions deviated slightly from his counterparts as he reminded markets that all options are still on the table heading into the June meeting, including increased production. Novak also highlighted the need for more data before a solid decision is made. Regarding the contaminated oil along the Druzhba pipeline (key conduit for crude into Eastern Europe and Germany), the energy minister noted that oil supplies to Poland will be available on Monday and that the contaminated oil would not affect its annual output forecast.</p><p><strong>*UAE: </strong>The energy minister took a harder stance regarding an ease of production cuts, stating that “it was not the right decision” amid fears of an oil price collapse.</p><p><strong>*JUNE MEETING:</strong> Eyes now turn to the main event (for energy markets) next month as the cartel and allies officially decide on either 1) an extension to the deal, 2) a revision to the deal or 3) an end to the pact. Sources noted that the Saudi energy minister and his Russian counterpart discussed two possible options. The first scenario would see an elimination of over compliance currently over 150%, equating to an output cuts just under 2mln BPD, according to calculations. This would mean a continuation of the current deal and an increase in production of around 0.8mln BPD. The second scenario would see an ease of the agreed cuts to 0.9mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Nonetheless, oil output data will be closely watched in the coming weeks for hints of which way OPEC and its allies may sway as they convene in Vienna on June 25/26.</p>",

ASX 200 (+1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were rampant at the open with the Australian benchmark at its highest since 2007 following a surprise win by PM Morrison’s ruling Coalition which defied the opinion polls to beat the Labor party and even reportedly secured a majority, while Tokyo sentiment was underpinned by a weaker currency and after much better than expected GDP growth for Q1. However, some of the gains were later pared as China entered the fray in which Shanghai Comp (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) resumed their losses amid US-China trade tensions after reports suggested negotiations were in flux and that talks have stalled, while comments from China were also concerning as Foreign Minister Wang warned the US to not go too far. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid a lack of demand for safe-havens in Japan and after the better than expected GDP numbers, while an enhanced-liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds also saw slightly weaker demand from prior.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat mixed as lingering trade uncertainty clouded over a buoyant start to the week. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%)&nbsp; were rampant at the open with the Australian benchmark at its highest since 2007 following a surprise win by PM Morrison’s ruling Coalition which defied the opinion polls to beat the Labor party and even secured a majority, while Tokyo sentiment is underpinned by a weaker currency and after much better than expected GDP growth for Q1. However, some of the gains were later pared as Chinese markets entered the fray with Shanghai Comp (-0.4%). and Hang Seng (-0.2%) resuming their losses amid US-China trade tensions after reports suggested negotiations are in flux and that talks have stalled, while comments from China were also concerning as Foreign Minister Wang warned the US to not go too far.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat near last week’s highs around the 98.00 level amid feeble attempts by its European counterparts to recoup Friday’s losses with EUR/USD and GBP/USD firmly below the 1.1200 and 1.2800 handles respectively. Brexit-related headwinds continue to be a hindrance on GBP after cross-party talks between PM May’s government and opposition Labour collapsed. Furthermore, Labour leader Corbyn declared to oppose PM May's Brexit deal, while reports suggested scepticism on PM May’s new offer to UK lawmakers which contains nothing new on customs arrangement and retains the Northern Irish backstop. Elsewhere, USD/JPY extends above the 110.00 level on the risk appetite in Japan and antipodeans are also higher with outperformance in AUD/USD following PM Morrison’s election miracle, while MXN and CAD are also mildly supported following reports that suggested US is to lift tariffs on steel &amp; aluminium from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid a lack of demand for safe-havens in Japan and after the better than expected GDP, while focus shifts to an enhanced-liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds later.</p>",
