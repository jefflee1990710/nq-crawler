Furthermore, the article states officials aren’t prepared for bolder action by making a half-point cut as recent economic developments have not signalled an imminent downturn. (WSJ)</p><p>Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dove) reiterated call for a 25bps cut at the July meeting and said a 25bps cut would give the Fed the option for a cut later in the year.&nbsp; Bullard also noted it would be difficult for the Fed not to ease at this point and would have to follow through on rate cuts to ratify earlier policy signals, while he sees no reason to revisit decision on timing of balance sheet runoff and would like to see a new repo facility made available but added the Fed is not at that point just yet.

(Twitter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Major US equity indices moved lower throughout the US session, whilst the dollar pared Thursday’s losses, as Fed sources on Friday pushed back against expectations of a 50bps cut in July and geopolitical risk rose after 2 UK tankers were seized by Iran. The heightened security risk in the Strait of Hormuz saw crude markets bid higher later in the session, bucking the trend of consistent daily losses this week, whilst gold found some support following its downward trajectory on the day. Microsoft (MSFT) shares jumped higher after the co. reported earnings; the co. beat on top and bottom lines, but more importantly exceeded expectations in terms of its Cloud revenue. PC and Productivity and Business Processes also exceeded revenue expectations. American Express (AXP) posted stronger than expected profits, while revenue came in largely inline. The co. reaffirmed FY19 guidance, however desks noted expectations for a revision higher and as such AXP shares were pressured lower. CrowdStrike (CRWD) was an outperformer, shooting higher after the co. posted decent earnings, which included an upwards revision to 2020 guidance and impressive ARR and subscription revenue (desks noted record numbers of customers added and a low churn rate). State Street (STT) made decent gains after beating on the bottom line, with fee income (especially in Asset Management and FX) also better than expected. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) moved higher after beating on top and bottom lines, with the co.’s da Vinci Surgical Systems seeing decent demand. Other notable stocks benefitting on the back of solid earnings include; BlackRock (BLK) missed on top and bottom lines but AUM up Y/Y; Capital One Financial (COF) big beat on bottom line; Citizens Financial Group (CFG) beat on top and bottom lines with loan loss provision, net charge-offs, Tangible book value all up; Gentex Corp. (GNTX) posted a top and bottom line beat but guided lower, Skechers (SKX) posted solid beat on top and bottom lines, SSS also higher. Chewy (CHWY) sunk after reporting a larger than expected loss. S&amp;P 500 -0.6% at 2977, NASDAQ-100 -0.9% at 7835, Dow Jones -0.3% at 27156.</p><p>The T-plex got off on the backfoot overnight and into the European session as the market pared back the dovish reaction from Fed’s Williams on Thursday. Although support was provided on the back of some disappointing German PPI data, where the Bund strength spread into wider government bonds. A mixed July (prelim.) University of Michigan survey didn’t cause a stir. Later in the US session, there was some further selling as Fed’s Bullard affirmed his preference to a 25bps rate cut at the July meeting, which was then echoed by Fed sources claiming that the general sentiment among Fed members was also for a 25bps cut. However, news of British shipping vessels being seized in the Persian Gulf saw bidding into the settlement, at which, the curve had flattened, seeing the 2s10s narrowing by approximately 3.5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 3+ ticks lower at 127-17.</p>",
