Stocks were under pressure, yields were lower, and havens caught bids from the falling DX. It was thin on the news front; developments in Italy received some attention in afternoon trade, however, there was little meaningful developments in other areas. It gave an ill-defined feel to trade, with traders now focussing attention on Wednesday’s FOMC meeting minutes, Jackson Hole which begins on Thursday, as well as ECB minutes and PMI data. Morgan Stanley said it expects the corrective risk rebound to reverse soon, which we got a glimpse of today; MS said that the rebound has been driven in part by investors' expectations that authorities will deliver a large (and quasi-coordinated) fiscal and monetary stimulus. But it warns that risk assets may suffer once investors realise that the authorities will under-deliver relative to expectations. However, not everyone is as gloomy: JPMorgan’s analysts said that we could still see equity inflows and outperformance into month-end. “Bonds delivered their strongest performance in over seven years and are up around 5% MTD, and equities are down around 2% MTD,” and as things stand, the bank says this performance divergence leaves fixed weight portfolios around 2% underweight equities, suggesting that they are likely to do a sizeable rotation out of bonds and into equities into month-end. JPM’s own model signals that these flows could drive a further 1.5% to 2% of outperformance for equities next week.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP: </strong>US President Trump on<strong> trade </strong>reiterated that China wants to make a trade deal, something will happen, \"maybe soon, maybe later\" however he is currently not ready to make a trade deal with China. He added someone had to take China on, whether it was good or bad for the US in the short term. Trump reiterated his call against the<strong> Fed </strong>to cut rates by 100bp over a period of time. On<strong> fiscal stimulus</strong>, says the administration is looking at possible tax cuts; always looking at a payroll tax and would love to reduce capital gains taxes, he added the US is very far from a recession. President Trump also renewed his support for Russia to return to what would become the G8.</p><p>* <strong>FOMC MINUTES PREVIEW:</strong> FOMC July Meeting Minutes will be released on 21st August 2019 at 1900 BST/1400 EDT. The main focus will be whether the minutes reiterate the ‘wait and see’ approach, or whether there is more conviction for a follow-up rate cuts. The minutes may be overshadowed by the Jackson Hole economic symposium, beginning on Thursday. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22582/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p>* <strong>ITALY</strong>: Italian Prime Minister Conte announced to lawmakers that he will resign (as expected) and avoiding a no-confidence motion. As his resignation was confirmed, it was reported Conte had been asked by Mattarella to stay as a caretaker leader. In his address, he attacked Lega leader Salvini for dragging Italy back into political crisis. Salvini, whose Lega party is currently leading polls, is eager for to capitalise on his recent popularity. With that said, although Salvini stated that the best solution was snap elections, he added that the League was willing to stay in the Government in order to approve the budget. The Autumn Budget deadline is October 20th, which would make it highly unlikely that elections could take place prior to the budget deadline; as such, Salvini's comments that he prefers elections mean that the automatic VAT hike of 3% would occur on October 20th unless a temporary government is appointed to see Italy through this data after which elections could then be held. There is, of course, a possibility that Italy will not go to elections if lawmakers can reach a consensus to appoint a new government. Analysts say any new government would likely be comprised of PD/5SM, although even there, it could be challenging for the two parties to reach an agreement. Much now depends on what President Mattarella does: he has the option of giving the mandate to another group, or calling for elections; he has recently expressed preference for getting the Budget through Parliament prior to calling elections.</p><p><strong>* PBOC</strong>: China’s central bank fixed its new 1-year Loan Prime Rate at 4.25% (10bps below the PBOC’s previous 1-year benchmark rate), and the new 5-year LPR at 4.85% (5bps under the 5-year benchmark lending rate), both in line with market expectations. \"While this should nudge banks to reduce lending rates slightly, the impact on economic activity will be marginal,\" Capital Economics says. \"A decline of only a few basis points is small and, unlike a benchmark lending rate cut, it will only feed through to borrowing costs on new loans, not outstanding ones.\" CapEco says the upshot is that the PBOC still has work to do: \"The spread between LPR and the MLF rate, the rate at which the PBOC lends to banks via its medium-term lending facility and upon which the new LPR is based, is now just 95bps,\" it writes, \"banks will be reluctant to narrow this further and so if the PBOC wants to continue to push down LPR it will need to take other steps, including cuts to MLF rates, to lower funding costs for banks.\"</p><p><strong>* RBA</strong>: Minutes from the August confab stated that further monetary policy easing would be considered if “the accumulation of additional evidence” suggests it is needed to support sustainable domestic growth achieve the inflation target over time. This was somewhat of a surprise, given that the SOMP and recent remarks from Governor Lowe highlighted that “the Board would continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely” and monetary policy will be adjusted accordingly. The key is that policy easing could be in response to an unforeseen global downturn without the labour market providing the justification. The minutes also emphasised concerns surrounding the global outlook: “trade and technology disputes have increased the downside risks”, the minutes said. On the flip side, the release stated that the RBA saw firmer GDP growth in Q2 (following three weak quarters) and outlook for consumption is more balanced than for some time, while noting that consumption was helped by tax rebates, and there was stabilization in housing markets. Analysts at Westpac believe that the Minutes do not dilute the importance of the labour market, however, the central bank cannot dissociate policy from global developments. Westpac maintains it forecast for the RBA to cut its Cash Rate by 25bps in October, before holding fire until early 2020 for the second 25bps cut.</p><p>* <strong>BREXIT:</strong> EU’s Tusk rejected UK PM Johnson’s request to abolish the Irish backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement. On Monday, Johnson wrote to Tusk, advising Tusk that the backstop is preventing the UK/EU from reaching a sustainable deal. The pound, however, saw some upside in wake of comments from German Chancellor Merkel, where she seemed to be calling for practical solutions on the backstop – a positive remark amid all the contentious rhetoric out of other EU officials – however, Merkel seemed to be suggesting that it was a discussion in the frame of the political declaration, not the withdrawal agreement; the upshot is that, although her rhetoric is more constructive, the dial has not changed all that much.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 0.01 LOWER AT USD 56.34/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 0.29 HIGHER AT USD 60.03/BBL. </strong>With no major catalysts to change the landscape overnight, markets have been choppy on Tuesday, with crude settling mixed ahead of US energy inventory data (will crude stocks build for a third week?). In the earlier session crude had been paring losses, with Brent popping its head above the USD 60/bbl level, but UBS’ Daniel Ellis is “wary” of turning too positive while trade disputes linger, highlighting the large hurdles in the way of a US-China deal. There was some late-day buying in the benchmarks, which did happen to coincide with reports that a Venezuelan PDVSA oil tanker had caught fire, although details remain thin on the damage, the prospect of the already suffering state oil company facing more supply disruptions likely raised concerns from market participants. Current expectations for the US energy inventory data have crude stocks -1.9mln bbls, gasoline +0.2mln, and distillates +0.3mln; Genscape sees Cushing stocks -1.68mln in the week through August 16th.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURE (U9) SETTLED 9+TICKS HIGHER AT 130-23+. </strong>The TPLEX moved higher on an illiquid August Tuesday as risk appetite faded, with participants tentative ahead of key risk events later this week, namely Fed Chair Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole. The move higher was predominantly in the European session, and exacerbated by some chunky block buys, with the having bull flattened by settlement; the 10-year yield fell 5bps whilst the 2-year yield fell 3bps, leaving the curve approximately 2bps flatter.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.8% AT 2901, NASDAQ-100 -0.7% AT 7664, DOW JONES -0.7% AT 25962, SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; -1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; -1%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; -1.4%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; -0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; -0.7%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; -1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -1%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; -0.2%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Home Depot (HD) had a mixed earnings report which beat on EPS, however missed on revenues and comp sales. Analysts are still positive on the name as Telsey continue to see HD as a “best in class operator, but the softer macro and housing trends… remain an overhang”, elsewhere Wells Fargo stated the report is a clearing event for an improving set up ahead. Baidu (BIDU) &amp; Medtronic (MDT) outperformed after its numbers beat on both top and bottom line, whilst Medtronic (MDT) also raised its FY EPS guidance. Kohl’s (KSS) closed in the red as it reported EPS in line with street expectations and a beat on revenues, however it reported its third quarterly decline in sales, comp sales fell 2.9%. TJX Companies (TJX) were initially pressured as revenues fell short of expectations, however losses were pared back throughout the session. EPS fell inline with expectations and consolidated comp store sales increased by 2%. WSJ report analysts are concerned that its TJ Maxx and Marshalls may be facing higher competition as department stores offer larger discounts and the increased popularity of resale sites could become problematic for the name.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) unveiled it has budgeted over USD 6bln for new original content its new video streaming service which weighed on streaming names, particularly Netflix (NFLX) who saw lows of 3%. Xilinx (XLNX) were pressured after reports in ZDNet which stated the co. has an ‘unpatchable’ security threat in its system-on-chip.</p><p><strong>* JAPAN/S.KOREA:</strong> Overnight, Japan approved exports of high-tech materials to South Korea for the second time since imposing export restrictions last month. Meanwhile, geopolitical analysts Stratfor note that as tensions persist between the two nations, a security-led intelligence sharing pact is due to expire on the weekend. “Seoul would be cutting itself off from valuable satellite intelligence, while Beijing is enjoying seeing US alliances stressed,” its analysts say.</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> <strong>DX</strong> was weaker and Havens (XAU, CHF, JPY) were firmer as markets took a risk off tone, with Treasury yields lower, ahead of key risk events later in the week, such as FOMC minutes, ECB Minutes, EZ PMI’s and the Jackson Hole Symposium. <strong>GBP</strong> was firmer following mixed rhetoric between the EU &amp; UK on the Irish backstop, taking its que after Merkel said they will think about practical solutions, however stating it is a question for the political declaration on future ties, not the withdrawal agreements, which capped its gains. <strong>EUR</strong> strengthened throughout the session once it was announced Italian PM Conte will hand in his resignation to President Mattarella, with 1.1100 serving as resistance. EMFX was stronger; <strong>TRY</strong> continued its surge after the CBRT announced efforts to promote bank lending through adjusting its required reserve ratios. <strong>ARS</strong> returned from holiday where it saw two rating downgrades as well as IMF commentary which suggested the Presidential challenger Fernandez may delay IMF loan repayments; nonetheless, ARS traded firmer throughout the session given central bank intervention, commentary and supportive comments from Argentina’s new Finance Minister.</p>",

GBP was firmer following mixed rhetoric between the EU &amp; UK on the Irish backstop, taking its que after Merkel said they will think about practical solutions, however stating it is a question for the political declaration on future ties, not the withdrawal agreements, which capped its gains. EUR strengthened throughout the session once it was announced Italian PM Conte will hand in his resignation to President Mattarella, with 1.1100 serving as resistance. EMFX was stronger; TRY continued its surge after the CBRT announced efforts to promote bank lending through adjusting its required reserve ratios. ARS returned from holiday where it saw two rating downgrades as well as IMF commentary which suggested the Presidential challenger Fernandez may delay IMF loan repayments; nonetheless, ARS traded firmer throughout the session given central bank intervention, commentary and supportive comments from Argentina’s new Finance Minister.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

There was some late-day buying in the benchmarks, which did happen to coincide with reports that a Venezuelan PDVSA oil tanker had caught fire, although details remain thin on the damage, the prospect of the already suffering state oil company facing more supply disruptions likely raised concerns from market participants.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling endured a real roller-coaster ride in the 2nd half of Tuesday’s EU session, and the catalyst for the bout of volatility was a remark from German Chancellor Merkel expressing a willingness to look at practical solutions to the backstop following what appeared to be a curt rebuttal from EU’s Tusk to a letter from UK PM Johnson requesting the removal of the current Irish border contingency plan as a condition for further Brexit negotiations. Cable spiked from sub-1.2100 towards 1.2200 before she qualified the statement of intent with the standard line out of Brussels that there is wiggle room on the PD, but no flexibility WA-wise, and the Pound duly slumped back towards 1.2100 again, while Eur/Gbp bounced from just a whisker over 0.9100 to circa 0.9145.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the US Dollar even though broad risk sentiment wavered after several days of renewed appetite or less aversion, with the Yen firming between 106.68-19 parameters and Franc straddling 0.9800 as Eur/Chf remained capped ahead 1.0900 into and even after Italian PM Conte announced his resignation. However, the Antipodeans are also outpacing their US counterpart after RBA minutes revealing a more stable/encouraging economic outlook and latest GDT auction results showing a retracement in dairy and WMP prices, although the bounce in Nzd/Usd seemed more corrective as 0.6400 held. Moreover, Aud/Usd failed to breach 0.6800 and the Aud/Nzd cross losses momentum ahead of 1.0600.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>A more pronounced downturn in crude prices undermined the Norwegian Krona and Loonie, with the latter only deriving limited traction from not as weak as anticipated Canadian manufacturing sales. Meanwhile, Riksbank comments noting heightened trade and global growth risks compared to July, but maintaining that Swedish inflation is in line with target did not detract from bearish Eur/Sek technical that pushed the Swedish Crown down to almost 10.7800 at one stage. Note also, the single currency pared losses after the aforementioned Senate developments in Rome and League Deputy PM Salvini’s offer to stay in Government to approve the 2020 budget even though the best option is going back to the polls. Eur/Usd staved off a test of short term chart support at 1.1065 to claw back towards 1.1100 alongside the Cable spike noted above.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Deeper post-CBRT reserve bank lending declines for the Try as technical impulses turn increasingly bearish, although the Lira has stopped the rot around 5.7500, while the Ars returned from a long holiday weekend to fall-out from 2 ratings downgrades and suggestions that Presidential challenger Fernandez may delay IMF loan repayments. However, the downside was limited to 55.7700 or so by verbal and physical Central Bank intervention plus supportive comments from Argentina’s new Finance Minister.</p>",

Crude had been paring losses, with Brent popping its head above the USD 60/bbl level at one stage, but UBS’ Daniel Ellis is “wary” of turning too positive while trade disputes linger, highlighting the large hurdles in the way of a US-China deal. Current expectations for the US energy inventory data have crude stocks -1.9mln bbls, gasoline +0.1mln, and distillates +0.6mln; Genscape sees Cushing stocks -1.68mln in the week through August 16th.</li><li>Cushing has been recording some hefty draws in recent weeks amid changing pipeline capacity out of the Permian Basin. The Cactus II and EPIC pipelines have recently come online, with a combined capacity of 1mln BPD set to be reached by year-end. The new capacity is bringing more WTI Midland grade crude to the Corpus Christi export terminal on the Gulf Coast. Rabobank’s analysts note that the premium of WTI Midland to WTI is an indication that current pipeline capacity is likely exceeding local production. The bank notes that the knock-on effect of the new pipelines has been that other pipelines have had to cut their rates to remain competitive; the Cushing to Gulf Coast pipelines Seaway (450k BPD) and Marketlink (700k BPD) have recently announced rate cuts, in-turn reducing the fair-value of the arb due to reduced transport costs of bringing WTI to the Gulf where it can compete with its European counterpart. The reduced pipeline transport costs have seen the attractiveness of WTI blossom, depleting crude stocks at Cushing whilst narrowing the arb; Rabo see potential for parity by Q4 19 as refiners shift to lighter and sweeter crude grades ahead of IMO 2020, something that the attractiveness of the WTI forward curve reflects.</li></ul>",

Elsewhere, core bonds have continued their impressive comeback with Bunds and Gilts now only a stone’s throw from Sep19 contract bests of 179.66 and 135.34 respectively, at 179.18 and 135.11, which seemed remote only yesterday.

        "content": "<ul><li>The growth outlook, as judged by global PMIs, could warrant 25bps rate cuts at all G10 central banks, Nordea says, noting that yields are falling globally. However, the bank says that not all of the G10 central banks have the same scope to cut rates – the Fed is best positioned to use the rate channel to loosen policy, and states that the likes of the BOJ, ECB and SNB are starting from a lower base, limiting the number of rate cuts available.</li><li>“Markets have so far also chosen to price in more cuts from the Fed than the ECB, even though the Euro-area outlook is probably worse than the US outlook, both on the growth and the inflation front. This is simply a result of differing starting points,” Nordea writes, “the Fed simply has room to cut (materially), while it is much more exhausting for the ECB to convince the public of the need for more cuts even deeper into negative territory (with that said, we expect them to cut rates). The USDEUR spread compression trade could continue to work based on this relatively simple line of thought.”</li><li>Nordea expects USDEUR spreads to narrow further, which the bank says is why hedgers of USD assets (or USD income) could roll existing hedges shorter on the curve, or else chose to hedge via a cross-currency basis swap; the bank considers a 5-year receiver position in the EURUSD XCCY basis an optimal way of hedging USD assets currently.</li><li>Nordea notes that the Fed rarely (if at all) underdelivers versus market expectations of cuts. “It can be too expensive not to deliver the expected cuts as the Fed risks to tighten financial conditions abruptly in that case,” the bank writes, noting that from a risk/reward perspective it continues to make sense to bet on the Fed delivering (at least) what is priced in. “Hence, USD hedge costs have likely already peaked last year as the Fed can ‘outcut’ the ECB over the coming quarters, which will continue to compress short-end US/EUR spreads as a consequence.”</li><li>However, Nordea says that this is not a green light for USD depreciation pressure, as the rate spread is not a particularly good predictor of EURUSD spot moves. Instead, Nordea says the focal point will be a continued drop in USD OIS rates alongside Fed cuts, and other sub-components of the USD hedge costs may not move in a ‘cheaper’ direction seen from a European perspective.</li><li>“Due to the new suspension of the debt ceiling, we expect the US Treasury to rebuild the cash buffer from roughly 110bn to the range of 350-400bn, which is why USD liquidity will be withdrawn from commercial banks,” Nordea writes, explaining that this usually leads to a widening pressure on USD-IBOR vs OIS spreads (more expensive USD hedge costs). “Furthermore, a tighter USD liquidity picture could reveal itself in a more negative XCCY basis (maybe in particular in the front of the xCcy basis curve).”</li><li>The bank also notes that the credit-spread case also still speaks in favour of more negative EURUSD XCCY basis readings: “It’s been a while since 5-year EURUSD XCCY basis spreads have traded this much ‘out of sync’ with relative credit spreads. When issuance activity picks up again in a couple of weeks, we expect the XCCY basis spread to reconnect.” Hence, Nordea says it likes to receive 5-year XCCY basis as a currency hedge of USD assets (or as a directional play). “Otherwise, we suggest that hedgers of USD income or USD assets don’t lock in the rates spread between USD and EUR rates too far out into the future (stay below six months if possible).”</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*TODAY</strong>: Italian PM Conte will appear before the Senate today at 1400 BST/0900 ET to respond to the political crisis the country is facing, after Deputy PM/League Leader Salvini put forward a vote of no-confidence against the government.</p><p><strong>*EXPECTATION</strong>: After Conte’s speech, the PM could offer his resignation to President Mattarella. If he does not, then Deputy PM Salvini will push for a vote of no-confidence. If the motion passes (widely expected as the League and PD are likely to back it), President Mattarella will hold formal consultations to see if an alternative coalition can be formed. If not, a technocratic government could be appointed with the goal of passing the Autumn 2020 budget (October 20th) to avoid an automatic 3% VAT tax hike. The failure of negotiations to form a government could see a general election, in October or November. On the flip side, If the confidence motion is rejected on Tuesday, Conte will retain his position, and the parties who voted against the no-confidence motion will be asked to form a new coalition, although Conte’s reprieve may be short-lived as he is due to appear before the Lower House tomorrow.</p><p><strong>*POTENTIAL</strong> <strong>ELECTION TIMING</strong>: Last week, Salvini proposed accepting 5SM's demand for a parliamentary reform in return for swift elections, a measure seen as an olive branch to progress proceedings; the proposal will see the number of MPs in both houses cut from 945 to 600; this has been approved by parliament on three occasions, with the fourth vote due in September. HSBC says that completing this reform would mean elections could not take place for another five to six months at least, due to the need to allow a possible referendum to be called, and to re-draw the electoral boundaries.</p><p><strong>*LOOKING</strong> <strong>AHEAD</strong>: Analysts at ING believe that elections remain the most likely option: “The possibility of new elections and the threat of an extended period of political uncertainty continues to hint at downside risks for the Euro, alongside the possible dampening effect of the ECB's easing package to be delivered in September”, it said.</p><p><strong>*LATEST POLLING: </strong>Comparing the 2018 general election results to current polls: League currently leads polls at 37% (it currently has 17.4% of the seats in the Lower House), PD follows in the polls with 23% (vs current 18.8%) and 5SM with 18% (vs current 32.7%). In terms of the smaller parties, Brothers of Italy poll at 7% (vs 4.4% in Parliament) and Forza Italia is polling at 6% (vs. current 14%)&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/088079e9-908f-4953-a020-55fddedc066b.jpg\"></figure>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%)</strong> traded indecisively as participants digested the mixed signals from the PBoC which conducted reverse repos but resulted to a net daily drain, and set its Loan Prime Rate at 4.25% which was lower than the previous 1yr LPR of 4.31%, as well as the Lending Rate of 4.35%, although not as low as some had anticipated. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid the mostly positive overnight risk tone and following mixed results at the 20yr auction which showed weaker demand amid higher accepted prices.</p><p><strong>PBoC set the 1-yr Loan Prime Rate at 4.25% vs. Exp. 4.24% (Prev. 4.31%) and set 5yr LPR at 4.85%</strong>.

Liu also stated that there is room for RRR and Lending Rate cuts and that urgency for interest rate reform is due to US-China trade war, industrial transformation and easing among global central banks. (Newswires)</p><p>PBoC stated interest rate reform cannot replace monetary policy and other policies, while it added that it will work with other government departments to take steps to lower corporate funding costs especially for small and private firms. There were also comments from PBoC Monetary Policy Department Director Sun that there is room to cut RRR in the future but not as big as people thought and that China will keep the benchmark deposit rate for a relatively long time.

Sectors are also mixed with no clear standouts, although the mining sector is resilient despite earnings from mining giant BHP (-0.7%) which missed on underlying net and warned of the impact from rising protectionism on the mining sector. In terms of individual movers, Pandora (+5.2%) rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 amid earnings in which the Co. initiated a wholesale inventory buyback program for Q3. Meanwhile, Casino (+4.0%) shares follow closely after the Board approved new French asset arbitrations for a target amount of EUR 2bln by the end of the first quarter in 2021. On the flip side, Royal Mail (-5.3%) fell to the foot of the pan-European index after the Communication Workers Union stated that a deal which included pay rises and new pension proposals is under threat from the Co’s management.

Conversely, Cable has lost grip of the 1.2100 handle that coincided with 200 HMA support and extended losses when stops were tripped through the 10 DMA (1.2099) to a low of 1.2084 amidst ongoing no deal Brexit worries following UK PM Johnson’s letter to EU’s Tusk stipulating that withdrawal negotiations are contingent on removing the Irish border proposal.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> It remains incremental and partly due to weakness elsewhere, but the DXY has inched closer to early August highs ahead of 98.500, at 98.425 vs 98.448, with perhaps some independent impetus coming via comments from Fed’s Rosengren underscoring his decision to vote against July’s FOMC rate cut. On that note, Daly and Quarles are on today’s docket as the clock ticks down to Wednesday’s FOMC minutes and then Jackson Hole that could be a platform for providing fresh policy guidance from the Fed and other global Central Banks.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF -</strong> The Yen and Franc have both regained an element of safe-haven allure as the recent/nascent recovery in risk sentiment stalls or falters. Usd/Jpy is drifting back below 106.50 and Usd/Chf is pivoting 0.9800, while Eur/Chf has retreated towards 1.0850 in the run up to Italian PM Conte’s Senate speech at 14.00BST that will seal the fate of Rome’s coalition Government.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/CAD - All</strong> narrowly mixed against the Greenback, with the Kiwi still lagging and slipping nearer 0.6400, while Aud/Nzd is inching higher above 1.0550 on diverging RBA/RBNZ near term policy outlooks. Elsewhere, the single currency is slipping further below 1.1100 amidst reports or corporate offers and eyeing short term chart support at 1.1065 before 1.1050 and the 1.1027 ytd base, while the Loonie is holding within a tight range in the low 1.3300 area and just ahead of underlying bids said to be sitting from 1.3340-50, with Canadian manufacturing sales due later.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Turkish Lira losses are stacking up after latest CBRT efforts to promote bank lending via reserve ratio enticements linked to loan quotas, and with the technical landscape turning increasingly bearish as Usd/Try clears more key levels. So far, the 50 DMA has been surpassed on the way to circa 5.7500 exposing a Fib just shy of 5.7550 and then 5.7681 that constitutes a lower high from late July.</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes from August 6th meeting stated the board would consider further policy easing if needed and that it is reasonable to expect extended period of low rates</strong>, while it added risks to economy tilted to the downside, there are few signs of inflationary pressures emerging and noted downside risks to CPI components. However, the minutes also stated the RBA saw firmer GDP growth in Q2 and outlook for consumption is more balanced than for some time, while it noted consumption was helped by tax rebates and there was stabilization in housing markets.

The former just touched 178.96 and the latter 134.95 for stellar recoveries of over and almost a full point from worst levels traded since recording contract peaks late last week. Similarly, US Treasuries have regained composure and the curve has flipped back into flattening mode, albeit with futures and yields still some distance from their record/multi-year highs and lows, and key spreads not close to turning negative again. Ahead, blank US data slate, but a couple of late Fed speakers on tap.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures are posting modest gains in early EU trade</strong> with little in the way of a catalyst thus far to influence price action ahead of this week’s inventory data, FOMC/ECB minutes and Fed Chair Powell’s speech. The former reclaimed the 56/bbl handle during Asia-Pac hours and has since been edging towards 56.50/bbl. Meanwhile, the latter straddles around the 60/bbl mark after having found a base at 59.55/bbl overnight. Looking ahead (aside from macro-newsflow), focus will be on the API crude stocks release which is expected to show a headline crude drawdown of 1.9mln barrels. Elsewhere, <strong>gold prices</strong> are marginally firmer and back around the USD 1500/oz mark amid potential dip-buying ahead of this week’s key risk events; meanwhile, IMF data showed that central banks continued to buy gold in July despite the yellow metal hitting 6yr highs<strong>. Copper prices</strong> are in the red today and back below the 2.6/lb level, albeit price action is relatively contained. Finally, <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> futures declined for a fourth consecutive session as supply concerns continued to ease amid rising iron ore exports from Australia and Brazil.</p>",

Sectors are also mixed with no clear standouts, although the mining sector is resilient despite earnings from mining giant BHP (-0.7%) which missed on underlying net and warned of the impact from rising protectionism on the mining sector. In terms of individual movers, Pandora (+5.2%) rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 amid earnings in which the Co. initiated a wholesale inventory buyback program for Q3. Meanwhile, Casino (+4.0%) shares follow closely after the Board approved new French asset arbitrations for a target amount of EUR 2bln by the end of the first quarter in 2021. On the flip side, Royal Mail (-5.3%) fell to the foot of the pan-European index after the Communication Workers Union stated that a deal which included pay rises and new pension proposals is under threat from the Co’s management. Finally, Bayer (BAYN GY) shares saw modest upside amid reports that the Co. is to sell its animal health business unit to Elanco for USD 7.6bln, divestment is expected to be closed in mid-2020.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/GBP</strong> - The Aussie and Pound at opposite ends of the G10 ranks, as Aud/Usd is bolstered between 0.6755-95 in wake of latest RBA minutes and a more balanced assessment of the economic situation after recent rate cuts and fiscal support via tax rebates that alongside stabilisation in the housing market should support consumption after firmer GDP growth in Q2. Conversely, Cable has lost grip of the 1.2100 handle that coincided with 200 HMA support and extended losses when stops were tripped through the 10 DMA (1.2099) to a low of 1.2084 amidst ongoing no deal Brexit worries following UK PM Johnson’s letter to EU’s Tusk stipulating that withdrawal negotiations are contingent on removing the Irish border proposal.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - It remains incremental and partly due to weakness elsewhere, but the DXY has inched closer to early August highs ahead of 98.500, at 98.425 vs 98.448, with perhaps some independent impetus coming via comments from Fed’s Rosengren underscoring his decision to vote against July’s FOMC rate cut. On that note, Daly and Quarles are on today’s docket as the clock ticks down to Wednesday’s FOMC minutes and then Jackson Hole that could be a platform for providing fresh policy guidance from the Fed and other global Central Banks.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF </strong>- The Yen and Franc have both regained an element of safe-haven allure as the recent/nascent recovery in risk sentiment stalls or falters. Usd/Jpy is drifting back below 106.50 and Usd/Chf is pivoting 0.9800, while Eur/Chf has retreated towards 1.0850 in the run up to Italian PM Conte’s Senate speech at 14.00BST that will seal the fate of Rome’s coalition Government.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/CAD -</strong> All narrowly mixed against the Greenback, with the Kiwi still lagging and slipping nearer 0.6400, while Aud/Nzd is inching higher above 1.0550 on diverging RBA/RBNZ near term policy outlooks. Elsewhere, the single currency is slipping further below 1.1100 amidst reports or corporate offers and eyeing short term chart support at 1.1065 before 1.1050 and the 1.1027 ytd base, while the Loonie is holding within a tight range in the low 1.3300 area and just ahead of underlying bids said to be sitting from 1.3340-50, with Canadian manufacturing sales due later.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> -Turkish Lira losses are stacking up after latest CBRT efforts to promote bank lending via reserve ratio enticements linked to loan quotas, and with the technical landscape turning increasingly bearish as Usd/Try clears more key levels. So far, the 50 DMA has been surpassed on the way to circa 5.7500 exposing a Fib just shy of 5.7550 and then 5.7681 that constitutes a lower high from late July.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> are both eyeing big figure or round number resistance after rebounding further from intraday lows and Monday’s even deeper troughs in the process. The former just touched 178.96 and the latter 134.95 for stellar recoveries of over and almost a full point from worst levels traded since recording contract peaks late last week. Similarly, US Treasuries have regained composure and the curve has flipped back into flattening mode, albeit with futures and yields still some distance from their record/multi-year highs and lows, and key spreads not close to turning negative again. Ahead, blank US data slate, but a couple of late Fed speakers on tap.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are posting modest gains in early EU trade with little in the way of a catalyst thus far to influence price action ahead of this week’s inventory data, FOMC/ECB minutes and Fed Chair Powell’s speech. The former reclaimed the 56/bbl handle during Asia-Pac hours and has since been edging towards 56.50/bbl. Meanwhile, the latter straddles around the 60/bbl mark after having found a base at 59.55/bbl overnight. Looking ahead (aside from macro-newsflow), focus will be on the API crude stocks release which is expected to show a headline crude drawdown of 1.9mln barrels. Elsewhere, gold prices are marginally firmer and back around the USD 1500/oz mark amid potential dip-buying ahead of this week’s key risk events; meanwhile, IMF data showed that central banks continued to buy gold in July despite the yellow metal hitting 6yr highs. Copper prices are in the red today and back below the 2.6/lb level, albeit price action is relatively contained. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures declined for a fourth consecutive session as supply concerns continued to ease amid rising iron ore exports from Australia and Brazil.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Pound at opposite ends of the G10 ranks, as Aud/Usd is bolstered between 0.6755-95 in wake of latest RBA minutes and a more balanced assessment of the economic situation after recent rate cuts and fiscal support via tax rebates that alongside stabilisation in the housing market should support consumption after firmer GDP growth in Q2. Conversely, Cable has lost grip of the 1.2100 handle that coincided with 200 HMA support and extended losses when stops were tripped through the 10 DMA (1.2099) to a low of 1.2084 amidst ongoing no deal Brexit worries following UK PM Johnson’s letter to EU’s Tusk stipulating that withdrawal negotiations are contingent on removing the Irish border proposal.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>It remains incremental and partly due to weakness elsewhere, but the <strong>DXY </strong>has inched closer to early August highs ahead of 98.500, at 98.425 vs 98.448, with perhaps some independent impetus coming via comments from Fed’s Rosengren underscoring his decision to vote against July’s FOMC rate cut. On that note, Daly and Quarles are on today’s docket as the clock ticks down to Wednesday’s FOMC minutes and then Jackson Hole that could be a platform for providing fresh policy guidance from the Fed and other global Central Banks.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen and Franc have both regained an element of safe-haven allure as the recent/nascent recovery in risk sentiment stalls or falters. Usd/Jpy is drifting back below 106.50 and Usd/Chf is pivoting 0.9800, while Eur/Chf has retreated towards 1.0850 in the run up to Italian PM Conte’s Senate speech at 14.00BST that will seal the fate of Rome’s coalition Government.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed against the Greenback, with the Kiwi still lagging and slipping nearer 0.6400, while Aud/Nzd is inching higher above 1.0550 on diverging RBA/RBNZ near term policy outlooks. Elsewhere, the single currency is slipping further below 1.1100 amidst reports or corporate offers and eyeing short term chart support at 1.1065 before 1.1050 and the 1.1027 ytd base, while the Loonie is holding within a tight range in the low 1.3300 area and just ahead of underlying bids said to be sitting from 1.3340-50, with Canadian manufacturing sales due later.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Turkish Lira losses are stacking up after latest CBRT efforts to promote bank lending via reserve ratio enticements linked to loan quotas, and with the technical landscape turning increasingly bearish as Usd/Try clears more key levels. So far, the 50 DMA has been surpassed on the way to circa 5.7500 exposing a Fib just shy of 5.7550 and then 5.7681 that constitutes a lower high from late July.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve started out the week on a steeper footing, with traders latching on to US comments from the weekend on China/Huawei. As US traders got to their desks, major spreads were between 1-2bps higher. There was also news, which came in post-settlement trade on Friday, where the Treasury is sounding out investors about a potential 50- or 100-year issuance. The Treasury in 2017 mulled similar moves, and the talk has been reignited after 30-year yields recently narrowed to record lows. Austria's recent 100-year supply was digested well by the market, highlighting the demand for longer-dated sovereign issues with higher yields. The TPLEX is also taking cues from EGBs; amid fears of secular stagnation and heightened trade risks, the recent dovish remarks from the ECB's Rehn calling for a September bazooka (underscored them today), combined with the notion of looser fiscal policy out of Germany to help cushion any economic downturn, has seen German debt sell-off. Meanwhile, there was little reaction to a hawkish set of comments from Fed’s Rosengren. The curve, however, gave back most of its steeper bias, and had mostly bear-flattened by settlement, though 5s30s and 10s30s were just under 1bps wider. US T-note futures settled 15+ ticks lower at 130-14.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US President Trump tweeted the economy is strong despite the Fed, while he repeated his calls for the Fed to cut rates by 100bps</strong> and perhaps some QE as well, which he said would make the US economy better. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fed's Rosengren (voter, hawkish dissenter)</strong> said US economic conditions are still pretty good and that his view at the last FOMC meeting was to focus on unemployment and inflation. Rosengren also commented that he would want to react to global weakness if it slows down the domestic economy but doesn't see a need to take action at this point and that they have to be careful not to ease too much when we don’t have significant problems, while he added it is a good time to \"sit-back\" and look at the data. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were initial reports that the White House is mulling a payroll tax cut to support the economy with discussions said to be still in early stages and no decision has been made whether to push for Congress to approve the reduction. However, it was later reported that White House officials stated cutting payroll taxes is not under consideration at this time. (Washington Post/Twitter)</p>",

ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) gained with outperformance in Australia fuelled by the energy sector after recent gains in oil prices and with earnings heavily in focus including BHP which traded lacklustre after it missed on FY net but topped revenue estimates and declared a record dividend, while advances in Tokyo were limited by an uneventful currency and despite reports Japan permitted additional exports of high-tech material to South Korea. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) traded indecisive as participants digested the mixed signals from the PBoC which conducted reverse repos but resulted to a net daily drain, and set its Loan Prime Rate at 4.25% which was lower than the previous 1yr LPR of 4.31%, as well as the Lending Rate of 4.35%, although not as low as some had anticipated. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid the mostly positive overnight risk tone and following mixed results at the 20yr auction which showed weaker demand amid higher accepted prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region gets a mild tailwind from the strong performance in US where the constructive tone was attributed to stimulus hopes and trade optimism, which saw the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA post a 3rd consecutive win streak. ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) are firmer with outperformance in Australia fuelled by the energy sector after recent gains in oil prices and with earnings heavily in focus including BHP which trades lacklustre after it missed on FY net but topped revenue estimates and declared a record dividend, while advances in Tokyo have been limited by an uneventful currency despite reports Japan permitted additional exports of high-tech material to South Korea. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are indecisive as participants digest the mixed signals from the PBoC which conducted reverse repos but resulted to a net daily drain, and set its new benchmark Loan Prime Rate at 4.25% which was lower than the previous 1yr LPR of 4.31%, as well as the Lending Rate of 4.35% but not as low as some had anticipated.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds on to the prior day’s gains although price action is uneventful overnight ahead of this week’s FOMC Minutes and Jackson Hole symposium where focus will be on whether Fed Chair Powell makes any suggestion the Fed is ready to move again on rates. EUR/USD and GBP/USD have also not provided much excitement with EUR/USD subdued below 1.1100 and with GBP/USD confined to the prior day’s tight range within the 1.2100 handle amid a continued lack of a breakthrough with the UK government unwilling to negotiate until the backstop is dropped and with officials preparing for a no-deal Brexit ‘dress rehearsal’, which suggests the increasing likelihood of the UK crashing out of the EU. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are contained amid a lack of fresh catalysts and data releases, while antipodeans are choppy as initial weakness in AUD/USD was later reversed following the RBA Minutes in which the central bank reiterated it would consider further policy easing if needed and that it is reasonable to expect extended period of low rates, but also noted firmer growth in Q2 and a more balanced outlook for consumption.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid the mostly positive risk tone and with participants also sidelined ahead of a 20yr auction later.&nbsp;</p>",

Furthermore, it stated the economy can sustain lower unemployment rate and unemployment is to fall below 5% during next couple of years, while it added it will take longer than expected to reach 2% inflation and that wage growth remained subdued with little upward pressure at the moment.</p><p>The initial reaction in AUD/USD to the rate announcement was to the upside although this was eventually pared as the statement didn’t provide much on forward guidance, while participants will be scrutinizing these minutes for any insight to support market expectations of another cut as early as October.</p>",
