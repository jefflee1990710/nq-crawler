Furthermore, Saudi, UAE and Kuwait did not take part in the OPEC conference call and a delegate noted that OPEC+ members will be unable to start production cuts earlier because April's oil production is already committed for export contracts.

Furthermore, Birol suggested that producers enact agreed production cuts ASAP and consider deeper cuts, financial regulators consider measures to discourage market disorder and that nations with strategic reserves make capacity available to take surplus barrels off the market.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Continued declines in crude benchmarks set the stage for a risk-off session on Tuesday. The losses in May WTI extrapolated into June contracts, and beyond, in both WTI and Brent, seeing the most liquid and actively traded WTI contract (M0) trade in single digits. The moves hit wider risk appetite, seeing the TPLEX continued to bull-flatten, as well as likely benefitting from participants beginning to downgrade their inflation expectation. The greenback outperformed as commodity currencies were hammered, although less so CAD. Meanwhile, equities headed lower, but despite the oil price collapse, energy stocks were outperformers after Trump declared his support for US O&amp;G sector. Apple (AAPL) may reportedly have to defer its new Apple AirPods Pro launch to H2 of this year, or even next year, according to DigiTimes. Meanwhile, Nikkei reported it has notified several suppliers that it intends to make roughly 213mln iPhones in the 12 months through to March 2021, +4% Y/Y. FT reported that Apple’s Chinese suppliers have slowed production and cut staff as global demand takes a hit for smartphones and other tech goods. Automakers (F, GM, FCAU) are reportedly in talks with the UAW about safely reopening US production. Boeing (BA) reportedly received an order for 45 fighter jets from the German Defense ministry. Beyond Meat (BYND) products will now be sold in Starbucks (SBUX) in China. LabCorp (LH) received FDA emergency authorisation for its home COVID-19 test kit. General Electric (GE) refinanced a USD 20bln revolving credit facility with a new USD 15bln agreement. JM Smucker (SJM) increased its sales and EPS outlook as consumers stock its good amid COVID-19. IBM (IBM) beat on EPS, revenue was in-line; however, its cloud revenue fell short. IBM also committed to maintaining its dividends. Coca Cola (KO) beat on top and bottom lines and noted Q2 would be materially impacted while noting volumes are down 25% since April. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat on both top and bottom lines while it maintained its 2020 operating, EPS and cash outlooks, although its revenue outlook was lowered. Travellers (TRV) missed on EPS, beat on revenue and raised its quarterly dividend. SPX -3.04% at 2737, NDX -3.71% at 8403, DJIA -2.67% at 23,019.</p><p>The TPLEX continued to flatten amid the wave of risk-off induced by falling oil prices. Similar to recent sessions, the bid in duration came in European trade, as the 10-year yield breached 0.60% to the downside, but lost pace as the US arrived, seeing the benchmark move in a channel of 0.54-0.58%. Meanwhile, the front/belly of the UST curve was more hesitant, although 5-year yields edged to new record lows at 0.301%. By settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 5s -2bps at 0.34%, 10s -5bps at 0.58%, 30s -7bps at 1.17%. The falling oil prices set the negative risk tone today. However, participants in the Fixed Income complex are also likely driving prices higher as they revaluate/downgrade their inflation expectations, as fears of oil price woes becoming more sustained grow louder. In rates, the nearby Eurodollar (M0) contract outperformed the rest of the pack, coinciding with an approximate 5bps fall in 3-month USD LIBOR, keeping T-Bill/Eurodollar spreads (TEDs) contained, as well as other spreads, such as FRA-OIS, which saw some pressure on Monday. T-notes (M0) settled 9 ticks higher at 139-12+.</p>",

Event: CBRT Rate Decision. Earnings: STMicroelectronics, Ericsson, Delta Airlines, AT&amp;T. Supply: UK.</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Continued declines in crude benchmarks set the stage for a risk-off session on Tuesday. The losses in May WTI extrapolated into June contracts, and beyond, in both WTI and Brent, seeing the most liquid and actively traded WTI contract (M0) trade in single digits. The moves hit wider risk appetite, seeing the TPLEX continued to bull-flatten, as well as likely benefitting from participants beginning to downgrade their inflation expectation. The greenback outperformed as commodity currencies were hammered, although less so CAD. Meanwhile, equities headed lower, but despite the oil price collapse, energy stocks were outperformers after Trump declared his support for US O&amp;G sector – perhaps a precursor to fiscal aid. Meanwhile, the recent outperforming sectors, such as Tech and Communications, were offered, note that NFLX trades little changed ahead of its earnings report after the bell. Moving forward, the Senate is scheduled to vote on the latest stimulus bill this evening, which is expected to pass; the Senate is scheduled to meet at 1630 ET/2130 BST.</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Tuesday (via state official health departments) against Monday:</strong></i></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NEW YORK</strong> cases +1.7% at 251,690 (prev. +1.9% at 247,512); death toll rises 3.4% to 14,828 (prev. +3.5% at 14,347).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY </strong>cases +1.5% at 183,957 (prev. +1.3% at 181,228); death toll +2.2% at 24,648 (prev. +1.9% at 24,114).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FRANCE </strong>death toll at 20,796 (Prev. 20,265); hospitalisations fall for a seventh straight day.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK </strong>cases rise to 535,342 (prev. 124,743), death toll rises to 17,337 (prev. 16,509); deaths rise by 823 (+5%) vs. yesterday’s increase of 449 (+2.8%).</p><p><strong>VACCINE/MEDICINE:</strong> China’s Global Times tweeted the China research team released the first animal experiment data on a COVID-19 vaccine, which showed it is effective and safe on rats and non-human primates. Meanwhile, the UK Health Minister said a vaccine from an Oxford project is to be trialled on people from Thursday.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p>WTI (K0, EXPIRES) SETTLED USD 47.64 HIGHER AT USD 10.01/BBL; WTI M0 SETTLES USD -8.86 AT USD 11.57/BBL; WTI (N0) SETTLES USD -7.59 AT 18.69; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 6.24 LOWER AT 19.33/BBL.</p><p>WTI and Brent June 2020 contracts continued to post record losses&nbsp;as global policy makers scramble into negotiations to determine a policy response. The macro narrative remains on oil, where WTI May crude futures on Monday plunged to negative territory for the first time in history amid an over-encumbered US physical market. This was initiated by the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on the contract which expired today. However, the volatile price action continued today further out the curve, with June contracts posting severe losses (WTI falling into single digits) and circuit breakers being hit in European trade. The extended losses in longer maturity contracts are likely indicative of the market seeing storage as an issue that will not dissipate immediately despite a supply side response. However, part of the price action is likely self-fulfilling too, as June contract holders either roll early or liquidate positions, in addition to speculative short positions likely being initiated. Goldman Sachs, to wit, suggests that with storage close to capacity, production will need to fall significantly to balance the market, which will set the stage for higher prices once demand recovers, “This inflection will play out in a matter of weeks, not months, with the market likely forced to balance before June.”</p><p>OPEC:&nbsp;Several OPEC members held emergency discussions today in efforts to fast-track the approaching production cuts to April, where they are currently pencilled to take effect on May 1st. However, the discussions were only discussions, with no decision to take action made at the meeting. Further, key members such as Saudi, UAE and Kuwait were not present. Elsewhere, Russia’s Kremlin downplayed the moves in the oil market, stating overnight that it is speculation that caused the movements. Kremlin also stated talks between OPEC+ members could be set up if needed; Moscow has all reserves it needs to offset weak oil prices. Meanwhile, shortly after settlement on Monday, WSJ citing sources noted that Saudi is mulling applying the agreed-upon oil cuts as soon as possible instead of waiting until May 1st.</p><p>PRESIDENT TRUMP&nbsp;said that the US would never let the “great US Oil &amp; Gas Industry down”, adding that he has instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available “so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!”; the announcement sequentially supported energy stocks. Earlier, Trump said the White House is looking at putting as much as 75mln bbls into the SPR, which would top it out, and that the oil price drop is short-term in which a lot of people got caught out and was largely a financial squeeze. Trump also suggested oil producers need to do more by the market in terms of output cuts, and that the administration will either ask permission from Congress to buy oil, or the administration will store it. When asked about stopping shipments of oil from Saudi Arabia, he said he would look at it; note there are reports of large crude carriers on their way to the US to offload Saudi supply.</p><p>TEXAS/N. DAKOTA:&nbsp;The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) meeting was held today, where regulatory agency were said to be split on whether or not to enforce production cuts; Chief Sitton said he favours curtailing production by 1mln BPD (~20%), although official Craddick was reported to still have questions about the cuts and concerns about years of litigation (Sitton downplayed legal issues). A separate official, Wayne Christian, said he is setting up a task force to get industry advice on how it can help. Ultimately, the RRC moved its vote on such matters to May 5th. Meanwhile, North Dakota Industrial Commission announced it had been hearing suggestions that the sharp declines in oil prices could require “immediate and drastic” action, where the state (2nd&nbsp;largest oil-producing state in the US) is reportedly weighing a response.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> President Trump said the White House hopes to have an agreement on small business programmes soon, with maybe a vote in the Senate for Tuesday, while he added that discussions on phase 4 stimulus will begin shortly. Senate Minority Leader Schumer said he believes the Senate will pass the new bill later on Tuesday; Senate are scheduled to meet at 1630 ET/2130 BST. A GOP aide said the agreement includes 250bln for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), USD 60bln for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program and for grants, and USD 75bln for hospitals and USD 25bln for testing, among other things. However, Fox Business News’ Gasparino, citing sources, suggested that the new PPP loans would be expected to run dry in just three to four days. The exact timing of additional stimulus passing is of not too much concern for market participants, rather just that Congress does get something passed, and the sooner the better; as PPP stimulus has run out of powder, banks have been reportedly extending such aid/loans in assumnption a top up will ensue. Meanwhile, Trump said that discussions on aid to state/local governments will begin after the small business loans aid is signed. Trump said the next round will cover infrastructure and tax incentives for restaurants, entertainment, hospitals, sports and payroll tax cuts. Previous figures touted for infrastructure by Trump have gravitated between USD 1-2trln; Democrats have also recently expressed an eagerness to get infrastructure spending in place. The aid for state and local governments will be welcomed too following on from Monday, where there were reports of revenue short falls in New Jersey (Governor Murphy called for direct Federal aid), as well as trader suggestions that Illinois was in need of a bailout or large debt restructuring. Elsewhere, Senate Democrat Leader Schumer, in a call with Fed Chair Powell, urged the Fed to make lending programmes open to non-profits and local governments.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump tweeted he would sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the US, citing the virus and the need to protect jobs of American citizens. Details on the immigration statement are thin, and as of yet there is no clarity on what countries would be subject to the ban (likely to be India, China, Mexico and Cuba), how the ban would be implemented, and for how long would the ban last. The move is likely to hit the US tech sector, according to Pew Research Center, which said “this will definitely impact immigration movements into the IT sector in the US from India and China, being two countries with large migration numbers globally.” A later draft report</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>ECB: </strong>The ECB<strong> </strong>could hold an emergency call on Wednesday where it would discuss accepting junk bonds as collateral; note that the ECB recently began accepting Greek sovereign debt as collateral.<strong> </strong>Elsewhere, ECB’s<strong> </strong>Knot said the ECB would not allow spreads to widen too much; ECB needs discretionary decision-making so it can front-load PEPP in some markets if needed; ECB needs to avoid becoming a permanent source of financing. Knott added that the ECB could not exclude increasing or extending the PEPP (currently EUR 750bln with a deadline t.b.d. by the ECB), although solidarity in crisis response doesn’t necessarily mean joint issuance (coronabonds).</p><p><strong>BANXICO: </strong>The Mexican Central bank cut its key rate by 50bps to 6.00%. The decision was unanimous, and it stated on initial assessment GDP could fall by over 5% Y/Y for H1 20, noted inflation would be subject to downside pressures stemming from the widening of the negative output gap, decline in energy prices, although a depreciating MXN would see upside risk. Pantheon Macroeconomics believes that the downside inflation risks will prevail. Pantheon also notes “more easing is looming” highlighting the clearly dovish tone of the statement, citing risks to the downside, a widening output gap and weak economic activity. The consultancy expects Banxico to take the rate to 5.00% or lower by the middle of the year. Banxico also implemented further measures to foster an orderly behaviour of financial markets, strengthen the credit channels and provide liquidity for the financial system. These measures are worth MXN 750bln, along with the previously announced measures equivalent to 3.3% of GDP. It announced it would monitor money market trading conditions and increase levels of liquidity during trading hours whenever it is deemed necessary. Banxico decided to widen eligibility of debt securities in the ordinary additional liquidity facility repos, and of FX hedges settled by differences in pesos and for US dollar credit auctions. The desk will also open a facility to repurchase government securities at longer terms than those of regular open market operations.</p><p><strong>RBNZ:</strong> Dovish remarks from RBNZ Governor Orr, who said he was open-minded on the direct monetisation of NZ debt. Some newswire calculations have indicated that the RBNZ may hold 27% of the government debt stock at the end of February. Orr said “direct monetisation, I know, has been heresy, taboo for a long time, but it’s only a long time in our lifetime,” and “it’s not a mysterious issue. It’s just not how we’ve run business.” strategists said that we should be under no illusion that this is to help fund the NZ government’s spending.</p><p><strong>RBA:</strong> There was little by way of new information in the RBA’s latest meeting minutes, with the central bank largely reiterating current policies “until progress was made towards the Bank’s goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself was raised.” Looking ahead, the RBA said the “broadening shutdown of non-essential activities and the restrictions placed on household activities” would bite despite supportive policy. Governor Lowe also delivered remarks on the macro outlook after the release of the minutes, and he said the RBA’s base case was for growth to fall 6% in 2020, and for unemployment to rise to around 10%. Lowe underscored the RBA’s current policies, and said the cash rate would be kept unchanged for “years”.</p><h2>GEOPOLITICS</h2><p><strong>NORTH KOREA: </strong>A CNN report that suggested North Korean leader Kim was ill following cardiac surgery last week have been dismissed by South Korea, though contributed to the risk-off overnight. Analysts noted that if the North Korean leader were to pass, it is not immediately clear who would take over the helm of the nuclear nation. “Would a new leader keep lines of communication open to ally China, to the US? Would they restart long-range missile tests to stamp their authority? Nuclear tests?” Bloomberg News asked, adding “Kim is, for better or worse, something of a known quantity. His demise would push the country into unchartered waters.”</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>EU Commission’s Thursday summit will not take a final decision on financing a coronavirus recovery fund, according to Diplomats and Officials. Several members have called for a clear expiration date for the recovery fund, and want to finance the recovery fund in 2021-22 via headroom in the next joint budget. Eurogroup Chief Centeno said that a rapid sizeable EU stimulus plan is needed, added that a possible tool is the Euro area budgetary instrument (BICC), where there is a strong case to reflect its role and rethink its size. Meanwhile, ECB’s Panetta said the EZ fiscal response to COVID-19 is inadequate thus far and threatens the single market, Politico reported.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p>T-NOTES (M0) SETTLED 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-12+.</p><p>The TPLEX continued to flatten amid the wave of risk-off induced by falling oil prices. Similar to recent sessions, the bid in duration came in European trade, as the 10-year yield breached 0.60% to the downside, but lost pace as the US arrived, seeing the benchmark move in a channel of 0.54-0.58%. Meanwhile, the front/belly of the UST curve was more hesitant, although 5-year yields edged to new record lows at 0.301%. By settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 5s -2bps at 0.34%, 10s -5bps at 0.58%, 30s -7bps at 1.17%. The falling oil prices set the negative risk tone today. However, participants in the Fixed Income complex are also likely driving prices higher as they revaluate/downgrade their inflation expectations, as fears of oil price woes becoming more sustained grow louder. In rates, the nearby Eurodollar (M0) contract outperformed the rest of the pack, coinciding with an approximate 5bps fall in 3-month USD LIBOR, keeping T-Bill/Eurodollar spreads (TEDs) contained, as well as other spreads, such as FRA-OIS, which saw some pressure on Monday.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -3.04% at 2737, NDX -3.71% at 8403, DJIA -2.67% at 23,019.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Technology -4.1%, Financials -3.2%, Communication Svs -3.18%, Health -3.14%, Cons Disc -2.66%, Materials -2.48%, Industrials -2.42%, Cons Stpl -2.27%, Energy -1.68%, Real Estate -1.61%, Utilities -1.61%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) may reportedly have to defer its new Apple AirPods Pro launch to H2 of this year, or even next year, according to DigiTimes. Meanwhile, Nikkei reported it has notified several suppliers that it intends to make roughly 213mln iPhones in the 12 months through to March 2021, +4% Y/Y. FT reported that Apple’s Chinese suppliers have slowed production and cut staff as global demand takes a hit for smartphones and other tech goods. Automakers (F, GM, FCAU) are reportedly in talks with the UAW about safely reopening US production. Boeing (BA) reportedly received an order for 45 fighter jets from the German Defense ministry. Beyond Meat (BYND) products will now be sold in Starbucks (SBUX) in China. LabCorp (LH) received FDA emergency authorisation for its home COVID-19 test kit. General Electric (GE) refinanced a USD 20bln revolving credit facility with a new USD 15bln agreement. JM Smucker (SJM) increased its sales and EPS outlook as consumers stock its good amid COVID-19.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> IBM (IBM) beat on EPS, revenue was in-line; however, its cloud revenue fell short. IBM also committed to maintaining its dividends. Coca Cola (KO) beat on top and bottom lines and noted Q2 would be materially impacted while noting volumes are down 25% since April. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat on both top and bottom lines while it maintained its 2020 operating, EPS and cash outlooks, although its revenue outlook was lowered. Travellers (TRV) missed on EPS, beat on revenue and raised its quarterly dividend.</p><p><strong>ENERGY:</strong> Energy names in focus again with the sector initially opening as an underperformer (~-5%), although it soon became the relative outperformer after President Trump directed the DoE and Treasury to formulate a plan to help the Oil and Gas industry. The sector closed negative, but well-off lows.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>GERMAN ZEW (APRIL):</strong> Headline expectations bounced-back to 28.2 in April from -49.5, topping the consensus -42.0. The current assessment component, however, collapsed from -43.1 to -91.5, deeper than the consensus -77.5. “We had expected a divergence between current assessment and expectations, but not to this extent,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “we have to take it with a pinch of salt.” Pantheon notes that the survey was compiled in the last few weeks, which coincides with the rebound in equity prices, which now appears to have run into a wall. With that said, the consultancy says it suspects the ZEW is a good metaphor for investors’ perceptions or hope. “Current conditions are terrible, but with lockdowns in full effect through April, conditions can’t get much worse,” and “this, by extension, means that the future has to look better, which is why expectations soared.” PM says the key is the path between now and the recovery. “We continue to think that markets are eyeing a relatively quick return to normal in Q3, which is possible, but also a long shot. It could very well be much slower than that.”</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>DOLLAR NOTCHES SECOND DAY OF GAINS AMID RISK-OFF</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The buck’s haven appeal was on display again as oil prices headed south and equities came under pressure. The DXY moved to highs of 100.48 but shortly after the US cash equity open, risk became more constructive, with yields and equities seeing a slight rise, although the turnaround proved short lived and both remain negative. Desks are also cognizant of the risk of a short-squeeze in the USD, after last week’s positioning data indicated the short was the largest since May 2018.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> With the precious metal trading less off risk in recent days, UBS highlights that the correlation between gold and the dollar has strengthened after being positive earlier in 2020. The dollar has continued to shine when it comes to haven assets, therefore this could explain some of the “out of the ordinary” moves in gold. The desk believes the current consolidation should offer an opportunity to build positions, noting it sees support at 1650 and expects gains in Q2 towards its 1790 target. Fundamental supply and demand factors are weak, the bank said, prices in China and India are discounted to the spot price, suggesting persistently weak demand, while shutdowns have had a direct impact on consumption. However, UBS suggests inventories are high and therefore as restrictions are lifted, there should be sufficient inventories to meet a gradual demand recovery.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX: CAD, NOK, RUB, MXN</strong> all under pressure once again as oil prices continue to slide. ING says it sees EM commodity FX as more vulnerable vs G10 peers due to weaker balance sheets and possible downgrade related-outflows (MXN, for instance); ING says we should expect volatility of oil exporting FX to remain elevated vs the oil importers in coming weeks.</p><p><strong>RISK-SENSITIVE FX:</strong> The likes of <strong>AUD, NZD, CAD and GBP</strong> were pressured by USD haven demand, as well as some idiosyncratic factors. Combined with risk sentiment, NZD downside perhaps is likely exacerbated amid a further reiteration from the RBNZ but this time from Governor Orr that negative rates are not off the table, although the Governor stated QE is more effective to deal with a virus shock rather than NIRP. The governor also stated he was open-minded on the direct monetisation of NZ debt. However, Citi’s analysts say they are still more constructive on NZD rather than AUD or CAD given that New Zealand is set to benefit from exiting lockdown in a strong position after quick action by authorities; Citi sees AUDNZD moving towards 1.0380.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling was particularly soft on Tuesday relative to its risk-sensitive peers, with little fresh news flow (a stale jobs reported was ignored, and BOE’s Haldane reiterated cautious comments). On the technical side, Credit Suisse looks for the core bear trend in cable to continue after it completed a “death cross” recently. The desk looks for a test at the early April low and 38.2% retracement of the March/April rally at 1.2176/66, and believes if these figures were to be breached, it opens up potential downside to the March base at 1.1934.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> EU leaders likely to agree COVID-19 economic plan at Thursday’s EU Summit; leaders are also expected to make progress on a Eurozone’ bad bank’. Elsewhere, Italian debt was on the defensive ahead of Friday’s review at S&amp;P, seeing the Bund/BTP spread widen, which has not had too much of a detrimental impact on EUR just yet, perhaps as traders wait for Thursday’s summit for potential catalysts (note: some desks think Italian government stability might be at risk if Conte cannot win concessions from the EU this week). Desks will also be on the lookout for ‘coronabond’ talk; UBS says if discussions remain stalled, the downside pressure on EUR should remain, and the bank expects ranges to remain rather tight going into the meeting and topside should be limited.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> JPY is catching a bid as stock prices fall, and a risk-off tone engulfs markets. Japan is also a net importer of crude. Volatility in USDJPY is “stubbornly relaxed”, Bank of America Writes, noting it has seen hardly any interest in warehousing positions in Yen.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> The collapse of the BRL and ZAR has not dissuaded the respective central banks from engaging in bond buys this year. SocGen says that from a valuation perspective, both the ZAR and BRL trade in the similar bracket, and as far away from the 20-year average as they have ever done, which SocGen says makes them appealing over a long-term horizon. MXN had little reaction to the Banxico’s latest move which cut its rate by 50bps to 6.00% while taking additional measures to foster an orderly behaviour of financial markets, strengthen the credit channels and provide liquidity.</p>",

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>USD: The buck's haven appeal was on display again as oil prices headed south and equities came under pressure. The DXY moved to highs of 100.48 but shortly after the US cash equity open, risk became more constructive, with yields and equities seeing a slight rise, although the turnaround proved short lived and both remain negative. Desks are also cognizant of the risk of a short-squeeze in the USD, after last week’s positioning data indicated the short was the largest since May 2018.</li><li>XAU: With the precious metal trading less off risk in recent days, UBS highlights that the correlation between gold and the dollar has strengthened after being positive earlier in 2020. The dollar has continued to shine when it comes to haven assets, therefore this could explain some of the “out of the ordinary” moves in gold. The desk believes the current consolidation should offer an opportunity to build positions, noting it sees support at 1650 and expects gains in Q2 towards its 1790 target. Fundamental supply and demand factors are weak, the bank said, prices in China and India are discounted to the spot price, suggesting persistently weak demand, while shutdowns have had a direct impact on consumption. However, UBS suggests inventories are high and therefore as restrictions are lifted, there should be sufficient inventories to meet a gradual demand recovery.&nbsp;</li><li>COMMODITY FX: CAD, NOK, RUB, MXN all under pressure once again as oil prices continue to slide. ING says it sees EM commodity FX as more vulnerable vs G10 peers due to weaker balance sheets and possible downgrade related-outflows (MXN, for instance); ING says we should expect volatility of oil exporting FX to remain elevated vs the oil importers in coming weeks.&nbsp;</li><li>RISK-SENSITIVE FX: The likes of AUD, NZD, CAD and GBP were pressured by USD haven demand, as well as some idiosyncratic factors.&nbsp; Combined with risk sentiment, NZD downside perhaps is likely exacerbated amid a further reiteration from the RBNZ but this time from Governor Orr that negative rates are not off the table, although the Governor stated QE is more effective to deal with a virus shock rather than NIRP. The governor also stated he was open-minded on the direct monetisation of NZ debt. However, Citi's analysts say they are still more constructive on NZD rather than AUD or CAD given that New Zealand is set to benefit from exiting lockdown in a strong position after quick action by authorities; Citi sees AUDNZD moving towards 1.0380.</li><li>GBP: Sterling was particularly soft on Tuesday relative to its risk-sensitive peers, with little fresh news flow (a stale jobs reported was ignored, and BOE’s Haldane reiterated cautious comments). On the technical side, Credit Suisse looks for the core bear trend in cable to continue after it completed a “death cross” recently. The desk looks for a test at the early April low and 38.2% retracement of the March/April rally at 1.2176/66, and believes if these figures were to be breached, it opens up potential downside to the March base at 1.1934.&nbsp;</li><li>EUR: EU leaders likely to agree COVID-19 economic plan at Thursday's EU Summit; leaders are also expected to make progress on a Eurozone 'bad bank'. Elsewhere, Italian debt was on the defensive ahead of Friday's review at S&amp;P, seeing the bund/BTP spread widen, which has not had too much of a detrimental impact on EUR just yet, perhaps as traders wait for Thursday's summit for potential catalysts (note: some desks think Italian government stability might be at risk if Conte cannot win concessions from the EU this week). Desks will also be on the lookout for 'coronabond' talk; UBS says if discussions remain stalled, the downside pressure on EUR should remain, and the bank expects ranges to remain rather tight going into the meeting and topside should be limited.</li><li>JPY: JPY is catching a bid as stock prices fall, and a risk-off tone engulfs markets. Japan is also a net importer of crude. Volatility in USDJPY is “stubbornly relaxed”, Bank of America Writes, noting it has seen hardly any interest in warehousing positions in Yen.&nbsp;</li><li>EMFX: The collapse of the BRL and ZAR has not dissuaded the respective central banks from engaging in bond buys this year. SocGen says that from a valuation perspective, both the ZAR and BRL trade in the similar bracket, and as far away from the 20-year average as they have ever done, which SocGen says makes them appealing over a long-term horizon. MXN had little reaction to the Banxico’s latest move which cut its rate by 50bps to 6.00% while taking additional measures to foster an orderly behavior of financial markets, strengthen the credit channels and provide liquidity.</li></ul>",

Similar to recent sessions, the bid in duration came in European trade, as the 10-year yield breached 0.60% to the downside, but lost pace as the US arrived, seeing the benchmark move in a channel of 0.54-0.58%. Meanwhile, the front/belly of the UST curve was more hesitant, although 5-year yields edged to new record lows at 0.301%. By settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 5s -2bps at 0.34%, 10s -5bps at 0.58%, 30s -7bps at 1.17%. The falling oil prices set the negative risk tone today. However, participants in the Fixed Income complex are also likely driving prices higher as they revaluate/downgrade their inflation expectations, as fears of oil price woes becoming more sustained grow louder. In rates, the nearby Eurodollar (M0) contract outperformed the rest of the pack, coinciding with an approximate 5bps fall in 3-month USD LIBOR, keeping T-Bill/Eurodollar spreads (TEDs) contained, as well as other spreads, such as FRA-OIS, which saw some pressure on Monday.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>WTI and Brent June 2020 contracts continued to post record losses</strong>&nbsp;as global policy makers scramble into negotiations to determine a policy response. The macro narrative remains on oil, where WTI May crude futures on Monday plunged to negative territory for the first time in history amid an over-encumbered US physical market. This was initiated by the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on the contract which expired today. However, the volatile price action continued today further out the curve, with June contracts posting severe losses (WTI falling into single digits) and circuit breakers being hit in European trade. The extended losses in longer maturity contracts are likely indicative of the market seeing storage as an issue that will not dissipate immediately despite a supply side response. However, part of the price action is likely self-fulfilling too, as June contract holders either roll early or liquidate positions, in addition to speculative short positions likely being initiated. Goldman Sachs, to wit, suggests that with storage close to capacity, production will need to fall significantly to balance the market, which will set the stage for higher prices once demand recovers, “This inflection will play out in a matter of weeks, not months, with the market likely forced to balance before June.”</li><li><strong>OPEC:</strong>&nbsp;Several OPEC members held emergency discussions today in efforts to fast-track the approaching production cuts to April, where they are currently pencilled to take effect on May 1st. However, the discussions were only discussions, with no decision to take action made at the meeting. Further, key members such as Saudi, UAE and Kuwait were not present. Elsewhere, Russia’s Kremlin downplayed the moves in the oil market, stating overnight that it is speculation that caused the movements. Kremlin also stated talks between OPEC+ members could be set up if needed; Moscow has all reserves it needs to offset weak oil prices. Meanwhile, shortly after settlement on Monday, WSJ citing sources noted that Saudi is mulling applying the agreed-upon oil cuts as soon as possible instead of waiting until May 1st.</li><li><strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP</strong>&nbsp;said that the US would never let the “great US Oil &amp; Gas Industry down”, adding that he has instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available “so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!”; the announcement sequentially supported energy stocks. Earlier, Trump said the White House is looking at putting as much as 75mln bbls into the SPR, which would top it out, and that the oil price drop is short-term in which a lot of people got caught out and was largely a financial squeeze. Trump also suggested oil producers need to do more by the market in terms of output cuts, and that the administration will either ask permission from Congress to buy oil, or the administration will store it. When asked about stopping shipments of oil from Saudi Arabia, he said he would look at it; note there are reports of large crude carriers on their way to the US to offload Saudi supply.</li><li><strong>TEXAS/N. DAKOTA:</strong>&nbsp;The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) meeting was held today, where regulatory agency were said to be split on whether or not to enforce production cuts; Chief Sitton said he favours curtailing production by 1mln BPD (~20%), although official Craddick was reported to still have questions about the cuts and concerns about years of litigation (Sitton downplayed legal issues). A separate official, Wayne Christian, said he is setting up a task force to get industry advice on how it can help. Ultimately, the RRC moved its vote on such matters to May 5th. Meanwhile, North Dakota Industrial Commission announced it had been hearing suggestions that the sharp declines in oil prices could require “immediate and drastic” action, where the state (2nd&nbsp;largest oil-producing state in the US) is reportedly weighing a response.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar appears to have run out of steam vs major rivals around levels corresponding to 100.480 in the index, and therefore just shy of the semi-psychological or half round number 100.500 mark. However, the Greenback is still retaining solid gains relative to high betas, commodity-based currencies and EMs as the carnage in crude markets continues with spill-over to risk appetite almost across the board.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>Some scant solace for the Kiwi, Aussie and Pound from the Buck’s broad loss of momentum, but torrid sessions nonetheless after more easing overtures from the RBNZ and downbeat economic news via the RBA, stats office and actual earnings data. Meanwhile, Sterling succumbed to a bearish combination of COVID-19 concerns, underlying hard Brexit jitters, BoE commentary underlining prospects of a more pronounced Q2 GDP contraction and technical factors. Cable was already on the brink of losing 1.2400+ status when the <strong>DXY</strong> cleared resistance around 100.300 that had held a couple of times previously and then retreated through the 21 DMA at 1.2357 before giving up 1.2300 and only stopping the rot ahead of the 30 DMA (1.2257). Similarly, Eur/Gbp rebounded further from sub-0.8700 back towards the 200 DMA (0.8737), but unlike Monday the cross made a clean break and is now eyeing 0.8840.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN</strong></p><p>Aside from Usd moves and general sentiment considerations, the aforementioned oil capitulation that is spreading along the curves and culminated in the June WTI contract plunging through Usd 12/brl at one stage, has hit the Cad, Nok, Rub and Mxn especially hard again. However, an emergency teleconference call between some OPEC members may yet instil some calm to choppy waters ahead of May’s impending WTI expiry.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>Relative and rare G10 outperformers or at least displaying resistance vs the Dollar, as Eur/Usd held above 1.0800 with a degree of support from an unexpected recovery in ZEW German economic sentiment that the institute declared offers a glimmer of hope for faint light at the end of a long tunnel. Meanwhile, the Yen straddled 107.50 amidst risk-off positioning that helped the safe-haven keep elements of its allure even when the Greenback was in the ascendency.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>As noted from the outset, regional currencies have been subject to risk and capital outflows, bar the Hong Kong Dollar that needed official intervention to stay within pegged parameters, with the Turkish Lira only just keeping its head above 7.0000 and South African Rand back under 19.0000 at one stage on more state-backed entities running out of cash. Next up for the Try and Zar, CBRT policy meeting and inflation data, both on Wednesday.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO:</strong> Continued declines in crude benchmarks have set the stage for a risk-off session, perhaps also some liquidity pressures (i.e. margin calls). The US ban on immigration also contributed to the downbeat tone; analysts have said it is likely to hit the tech sector particularly. Elsewhere, markets are once again focused on North Korea amid conflicting reports on the health of dictator Kim Jung-un. Amid the soured risk sentiment have seen the DXY reclaim 100, though the JPY is flat; XAU is under pressure and back around 1670/oz. The Treasury curve is bull-flattening.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Automakers (F, GM, FCAU) are reportedly in talks with the UAW about safely reopening US production. Boeing (BA) reportedly received an order for 45 fighter jets from the German Defense ministry. Beyond Meat (BYND) products will now be sold in Starbucks (SBUX) in China. LabCorp (LH) received FDA emergency authorisation for its home COVID-19 test kit. General Electric (GE) refinanced a USD 20bln revolving credit facility with a new USD 15bln agreement. JM Smucker (SJM) increased its sales and EPS outlook as consumers stock its good amid COVID-19.</p><p><strong>APPLE (AAPL): </strong>The tech giant may reportedly have to defer its new Apple AirPods Pro launch to H2 of this year, or even next year, according to DigiTimes. Meanwhile, Nikkei reported it has notified several suppliers that it intends to make roughly 213mln iPhones in the 12 months through to March 2021, +4% Y/Y. FT reports that Apple’s Chinese suppliers have slowed production and cut staff as global demand takes a hit for smartphones and other tech goods.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> IBM (IBM) beat on EPS, revenue was in-line, however its cloud revenue fell short. IBM also maintained commitment to paying dividends. Coca Cola (KO) beat on top and bottom lines, and noted Q2 will be materially impacted while noting volumes are down 25% since April. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat on both top and bottom lines while it maintained its 2020 operating, EPS and cash outlooks, however its revenue outlook was lowered. Travelers (TRV) missed on EPS, beat on revenue and raised its quarterly dividend.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>All sectors are in negative territory, with Energy and Financials lagging once again with the former weighed on by the continued downside in the crude complex, although perhaps some support will be seen as President Trump announce he has asked both the Energy Secretary and Treasury Secretary to formulate a plan to make funds available for the sector. Financials are suffering as the curve bull-flattens with yields lower across the curve.</p><p><strong>TECH SECTOR: </strong>US President Trump stated that in light of COVID-19, and the need to protect US workers, he'd be signing an executive order to suspend immigration. Details are thin, and as yet there is no clarity on what countries would be subject to the ban (likely to be India, China, Mexico and Cuba), how the ban would be implemented, and for how long would the ban last. The move was likely to hit the US tech sector, according to Pew Research Center, which said \"this will definitely impact immigration movements into the IT sector in the US from India and China, being two countries with large migration numbers globally.\"</p><p><strong>INFLATION:</strong> With the oil price declines extending, discussion grows around the potential for a marked deterioration in the inflation landscape. UBS believes the price fall is not a genuine deflation threat, as such. The bank says deflation is a general fall in prices; noting recent moves as a single commodity falling in price because of specific issues in a sub-set of a single geographic market. However, others draw attention to energy’s dominance in the composition of many inflation measures, additionally, its role as an input cost for producers, where if losses are to be sustained, the probability of a deflationary outlook grows.</p>",

Similarly, the Greenback is retaining recovery momentum and the DXY is braced just below a fractional new apex for the day at 100.420, with Usd/Cad on the 1.4200 handle and Cable clearly down through another big figure (1.2300 and heading for the 30 DMA).</p>",

Oil markets drew a lot of attention after WTI crude futures plunged and the May contract turned negative for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was due to the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on a contract which is due for settlement today. Note, the more widely-traded June contract remained above USD 20/bbl throughout the chaos and the May contract gradually returned to positive territory. <strong>ASX 200 (-2.5%)</strong> weakened with focus on corporate updates including mixed quarterly production numbers from BHP which subsequently weighed on the mining giant and with Virgin Australia going into voluntary administration in an effort to recapitalize amid the government’s refusal for a bailout. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.0%)</strong> was pressured by the flows into the currency and the <strong>KOSPI (-1.0%) </strong>was initially among the worst hit amid uncertainty regarding the geopolitical climate for the Korean peninsula after reports that North Korea leader Kim was in grave danger following cardiovascular surgery which boosted defence stocks, although South Korea have denied the reports of Kim’s condition. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.1%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%)</strong> also traded lower with underperformance in Hong Kong after social distancing restrictions were extended for 14 days and after the recent sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy with initial gains seen amid the risk averse tone and similar upside in T-notes but with price action only mild as participants also digested mixed results from the 20yr JGB auction which saw a lower b/c and wider tail in price.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

(Newswires/CNN/Yonhap)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Europe has latched onto the downbeat lead from the Asia-Pac session (Euro Stoxx 50 -2.1%),</strong> as oil markets continue to crater whilst stock also weighs the COVID-19 impact on large-cap earnings. US equity futures fare slightly better than its counterparts across the pond – with the prospect of another State-side stimulus package potentially providing some support. Broader sectors are lower across the board and point towards risk aversion. Energy underperforms amid the depressing performance in the crude complex, whilst the breakdown has Oil &amp; Gas as the marked laggard, closely following by Basic Resources and Banks. In terms of individual movers, SAP (-2.3%) fell post earnings after cutting its FY total revenue guidance alongside its FCF guidance, adding to the woes for the IT sector after IBM earnings overnight. The company expects a deterioration in Q2 before gradual improvement in Q3 and Q4. PSA (-0.5%) remains subdued by its respective update in which it sees European car sales -25% and China -10% in FY20. Richemont (-3.0%) and Swatch (-2.9%) bear the brunt of Swiss watch sales slumping over 20% YY.</p><p><strong>Coca-Cola Co (KO) </strong>Q1 20 (USD): Non-GAAP EPS 0.51 (exp. 0.44), Revenue 8.6bln (exp. 8.29bln). COVID-19 will impact Q2 materially; Co. withdraws its guidance</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD - </strong>It remains to be seen whether the Kiwi and Aussie fall prey to the phenomenon of ‘turnaround Tuesday’, but for now the tide has certainly changed markedly as RBNZ Governor Orr reiterated dovish guidance overnight and the option of more stimulus at the May policy meeting, while his RBA counterpart delivered a daunting economic outlook to compound a sharp decline in wages and the stats bureau publishing figures for March 14-April 4 revealing a 6% drop in employment. In response, Nzd/Usd is back below 0.6000 and Aud/Usd is under 0.6300 again, while the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0500. For the record, RBA minutes did not really impact even though scaling back QE was mentioned if conditions improve. Elsewhere, Loonie losses are accumulating almost in lock-step with oil prices, as WTI and Brent lose grip of Usd12 and Usd19/brl handles respectively in the June contracts after Monday’s May capitulation, with Usd/Cad up through 1.4200 and eyeing 1.4250 ahead of Canadian retail sales data.</p><p><strong>USD/JPY -</strong> The Yen is marginally eclipsing the Dollar as safe-haven currency of choice amidst renewed risk-off positioning and the ongoing rout in crude markets, as Usd/Jpy edges towards 107.00 and the DXY tests resistance above 100.00 around 100.300 again that has been rejected a couple of times in recent sessions.</p><p><strong>NOK/GBP/SEK/CHF/EUR - </strong>No shock that the Norwegian Krona, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso are all underperforming alongside oil, but broader risk asset contagion is also weighing heavily on the likes of the Swedish Crown, British Pound and even Swiss Franc. Indeed, better than expected jobs data and a wider trade surplus have been largely ignored, while the Euro has only derived partial encouragement from the latest German ZEW survey showing some signs of improvement in sentiment to counter the steep deterioration in current conditions. Eur/Nok has been up above 11.5900, Usd/Rub as high as 77.2400+, Usd/Mxn over 24.3000, while Eur/Sek straddles 10.9000, Cable gives up another big figure at 1.2400 and breaches the 21 DMA (1.2357), Usd/Chf rebounds from sub-0.9700 to circa 0.9715 and Eur/Usd rotates either side of 1.0850.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the Zar and Hkd as the Rand weakens on more SA financial strain given a missed loan payment by the Land and Agricultural Development Bank, while the HKMA has sold Hong Dollars to maintain the peg for the first time in over 4 years despite yesterday’s ratings downgrade by Fitch.</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes</strong> from April 7th meeting stated daily operations are likely to be on smaller scale in near-term and that they will do what is necessary to achieve 3yr yield target, while the board remained committed to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses. RBA added that the Australian financial system has stayed resilient and that GDP could decline significantly in June quarter, as well as remain subdued in September quarter. Furthermore, the minutes suggested it is unlikely that support packages will provide strong boost to spending in near-term due to shutdown and restrictions. (Newswires)</p><p>Australia Bureau of Statistics said new data showed jobs declined 6% for March 14th-April 4th. (Newswires)</p><p>RBNZ Governor Orr said QE is more effective to deal with sharp virus shock rather than negative rates, but added that negative rates are not ruled out and that they are open minded on direct monetization of New Zealand debt. (Newswires)</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe says monetary response is keeping funding costs low, adds will continue to adjust bond and repo operations as needed to support liquidity in the system. Lowe added that the Unemployment rate is likely to be around 10% by June but hopes it might be lower than this if businesses are able to retain their employees on lower hours. Has no objection to the purchase of longer-dated bonds, focus on the short-end for now; does not believe bank dividends need to be banned. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It’s been a relatively measured advance to new intraday peaks for <strong>Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries</strong> given the persistent weakness in stocks and further capitulation in crude markets where Brent seemed to be feeling the strain early on before June WTI caught up and tumbled over Usd 10/brl from best levels at one stage. However, at 173.08, 137.05 and 139-17+ respectively the respective 10 year benchmarks have crossed bullish technical levels that may embellish their safe-haven allure, while Italian bonds are lagging between 135.61-136.70 parameters vs yesterday’s 136.19 close, albeit on syndication considerations rather than any real or new negative fundamental factors as demand for 5 and 30 year BTPs tops Eur70 bn.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent June </strong>contracts are posting unprecedented losses. Attention remains on the oil market since yesterday WTI May crude futures plunged to negative territory for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was sparked by the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on the contract which is due for expiry later today. The volatile price action followed through to today’s trade with WTI June contracts -42% at one point, and Brent down over 25% - with the former dipping below USD 12/bbl, to trigger a <strong>2-minute circuit breaker</strong> and the latter residing sub-20/bbl. Russia’s Kremlin emerged amid the volatile action and downplayed the moves in the oil market, stating that its speculation sparked the movements. Kremlin also stated talks between OPEC+ members can be set up if needed; Moscow has all reserves it needs to offset weak oil prices. Meanwhile yesterday, WSJ citing sources noted that Saudi is mulling applying the agreed-upon oil cuts as soon as possible instead of waiting until May 1st. Elsewhere, today will see the second official Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) meeting, where the Texas regulatory agency is expected today to provide more colour on its stance regarding potential oil production curtailment in the state. However, the RRC is reportedly unlikely to vote on a plan to mandate oil production cuts for Texas at the Tuesday meeting, according to Energy Intel citing sources. As a reminder, the meeting last week saw disagreement on whether cuts should be implemented or not, with larger producers mostly arguing for market-driven declines, and smaller players supportive of cuts. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> trades relatively flat and meanders just south of USD 1700/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices meanwhile track sentiment and the downside in stocks, with the red metal now below USD 2.25/lb.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said we're looking at putting as much as 75mln bbls into SPR which would top it out and that the oil price drop is short-term in which a lot of people got caught out and was largely a financial squeeze</strong>. Furthermore, President Trump suggested oil producers need to do more by the market in terms of output cuts and that the administration will either ask permission from Congress to buy oil or we will store it, while he also responded we will look at it when questioned about stopping shipments of oil from Saudi Arabia. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) is reportedly unlikely to vote on a plan to mandate oil production cuts for Texas at the Tuesday meeting, according to Energy Intel citing sources.</strong> (Twitter)</p><p>Goldman Sachs suggested there could be more chaos for May WTI crude contract and notes oil collapse is due to unprecedented supply glut, while it warned June WTI contract could be pressured next. (Newswires)</p><p>Russian Kremlin says it is closely monitoring oil prices and sees nothing apocalyptic in falling oil prices; talks between OPEC+ members can be set up if needed; Moscow has all reserves it needs to offset weak oil prices.

Attention remains on the oil market since yesterday WTI May crude futures plunged to negative territory for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was sparked by the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on the contract which is due for expiry later today. The volatile price action followed through to today’s trade with WTI June contracts -42% at one point, and Brent down over 25% - with the former dipping below 12/bbl, to trigger a 2-minute circuit breaker and the latter residing sub-20/bbl. Russia’s Kremlin emerged amid the volatile action and downplayed the moves in the oil market, stating that its speculation sparked the movements. Kremlin also stated talks between OPEC+ members can be set up if needed; Moscow has all reserves it needs to offset weak oil prices. Meanwhile yesterday, WSJ citing sources noted that Saudi is mulling applying the agreed-upon oil cuts as soon as possible instead of waiting until May 1st. Elsewhere, today will see the second official Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) meeting, where the Texas regulatory agency is expected today to provide more colour on its stance regarding potential oil production curtailment in the state. However, the RRC is reportedly unlikely to vote on a plan to mandate oil production cuts for Texas at the Tuesday meeting, according to Energy Intel citing sources. As a reminder, the meeting last week saw disagreement on whether cuts should be implemented or not, with larger producers mostly arguing for market-driven declines, and smaller players supportive of cuts.&nbsp; Elsewhere, spot gold trades relatively flat and meanders just south of USD 1700/oz. Copper prices meanwhile track sentiment and the downside in stocks, with the red metal now below USD 2.25/lb.</p>",

Oil markets drew a lot of attention after WTI crude futures plunged and the May contract turned negative for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was due to the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on a contract which is due for settlement today.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets were negative across the board following the weak handover from Wall St where sentiment was subdued. </strong>Oil markets drew a lot of attention after WTI crude futures plunged and the May contract turned negative for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was due to the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on a contract which is due for settlement today. Note, the more widely-trade June contract remained above USD 20/bbl throughout the chaos and the May contract gradually returned to positive territory. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.6%)</strong> weakened with focus on corporate updates including mixed quarterly production numbers from BHP which subsequently weighed on the mining giant and with Virgin Australia going into voluntary administration in an effort to recapitalize amid the government’s refusal for a bailout. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.0%)</strong> was pressured by the flows into the currency and the <strong>KOSPI (-1.5%)</strong> was initially among the worst hit amid uncertainty regarding the geopolitical climate for the Korean peninsula after reports that North Korea leader Kim was in grave danger following cardiovascular surgery which boosted defence stocks, although South Korea have denied the reports of Kim’s condition. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.1%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) </strong>also traded lower with underperformance in Hong Kong after social distancing restrictions were extended for 14 days and after the recent sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy with initial gains seen amid the risk averse tone and similar upside in T-notes but with price action only mild as participants also digested mixed results from the 20yr JGB auction which saw a lower b/c and wider tail in price.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day. (Newswires) PBoC conducted CNY 5bln central bank bill swap operation today.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> was firmer and rose above the 100.00 level as it benefitted from its safe-haven status amid the broad risk-averse tone which was also not helped by US President Trump’s announcement to sign an executive order to suspend immigration into the US citing the coronavirus outbreak and a need to protect jobs. The greenback’s major counterparts were subdued with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> falling below 1.0850 but with downside stemmed after the recent initial steps to reopen EU economies, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> tested 1.2400 to the downside as the currency remained dampened by the ongoing woeful outlook for the economy. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were subdued by the risk-tone which also weighed on antipodeans due to their high-beta statuses to push <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> below the 0.6300 and 0.6000 handles respectively. Furthermore, a 6% decline in Australia jobs for March 14th-April 4th and dovish comments from RBNZ Governor Orr provided no favours for currencies on both sides of the Tasman, while <strong>KRW</strong> underperformed on the geopolitical uncertainty following conflicting reports of North Korea leader Kim’s condition.</p><p>RBA Minutes from April 7th meeting stated daily operations are likely to be on smaller scale in near-term and that they will do what is necessary to achieve 3yr yield target, while the board remained committed to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses. RBA added that the Australian financial system has stayed resilient and that GDP could decline significantly in June quarter, as well as remain subdued in September quarter. Furthermore, the minutes suggested it is unlikely that support packages will provide strong boost to spending in near-term due to shutdown and restrictions. (Newswires)</p><p>Australia Bureau of Statistics said new data showed jobs declined 6% for March 14th-April 4th. (Newswires)</p><p>RBNZ Governor Orr said QE is more effective to deal with sharp virus shock rather than negative rates, but added that negative rates are not ruled out and that they are open minded on direct monetization of New Zealand debt. (Newswires)</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe says monetary response is keeping funding costs low, adds will continue to adjust bond and repo operations as needed to support liquidity in the system. Lowe added that the Unemployment rate is likely to be around 10% by June but hopes it might be lower than this if businesses are able to retain their employees on lower hours. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Mayhem was observed in the oil market in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures plunged heading into the daily settlement and the May contract turned negative for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was amid the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on a contract which is due for settlement today, although the June futures remained above the USD 20/bbl throughout the chaos and the May contract gradually returned to positive territory. Furthermore, there were comments from President Trump that noted the moves were a financial squeeze and reiterated intentions to purchase oil for the SPR, while Goldman Sachs suggested there could be further turmoil and the June contract could be pressured next. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were relatively flat after recently being contained by resistance at the USD 1700/oz level and <strong>copper</strong> extended on declines amid the broad risk averse tone.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said we're looking at putting as much as 75mln bbls into SPR which would top it out and that the oil price drop is short-term in which a lot of people got caught out and was largely a financial squeeze</strong>. Furthermore, President Trump suggested oil producers need to do more by the market in terms of output cuts and that the administration will either ask permission from Congress to buy oil or we will store it, while he also responded we will look at it when questioned about stopping shipments of oil from Saudi Arabia. (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs suggested there could be more chaos for May WTI crude contract and notes oil collapse is due to unprecedented supply glut, while it warned June WTI contract could be pressured next. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p><strong>North Korea leader Kim is said to be in grave danger following surgery and an anonymous US official said the US has information on North Korea leader Kim's critical condition and is studying the line of succession. However, the South Korea government said North Korea Leader Kim is not seriously ill and noted there is no unusual movement in North Korea</strong>, while China’s Communist Party International Liaison Department said North Korea Leader Kim is thought to not be critically ill. (Newswires/CNN/Yonhap)</p><p>Syria forces reportedly downed Israeli 'hostile targets' near Palmyra. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX modestly bull-flattened as the crude losses kept risk appetite at bay; by settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3bps at 0.62%, 30s -5bps at -1.23%. The gains came mainly overnight as oil prices made their descent, although heading into the US session yields traded rangebound, with the 10-year yield swimming between 0.61-0.65%. Note, while front-month oil futures made record losses (and prices), the move in other assets, particularly USTs, were muted. Participants were unwilling to let yields fall lower, perhaps indicative of their collective view that near-term oil price fluctuations were temporary, rather than that of the beginning of a sustained disinflationary environment. At the same time, it is worth highlighting that pressure on yields were also likely muted as Fed has now pared its purchases to approximately USD 15bln per day from USD 30bln last week, and as one would expect, offer-to-cove ratios have elevated at the operations on Monday. Furthermore, a handful of corporate issuances to start the week gave participants more supply to digest. In the front-end, FRA-OIS spreads widened on Monday, with Fed data showing commercial paper rates remain elevated while the background of ramped up US CMBs and T-Bill issuance puts upward pressure on the complex. T-notes (M20) settled 7 ticks higher at 139-03+.</p><p><strong>US President Trump tweeted he will sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the US citing virus and need to protect jobs of American citizens</strong>.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were negative across the board following the weak handover from Wall St where sentiment was subdued by the oil market pandemonium in which WTI crude futures plunged and the May contract turned negative for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was due to the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on a contract which is due for settlement today, although the June futures remained above the USD 20/bbl throughout the chaos and the May contract gradually returned to positive territory. ASX 200 (-1.6%) weakened with focus on corporate updates including mixed quarterly production numbers from BHP which subsequently weighed on the mining giant and with Virgin Australia going into voluntary administration in an effort to recapitalize amid the government’s refusal for a bailout. Nikkei 225 (-2.0%) was pressured by the flows into the currency and the KOSPI (-1.5%) was initially among the worst hit amid uncertainty regarding the geopolitical climate for the Korean peninsula after reports that North Korea leader Kim was in grave danger following cardiovascular surgery which boosted defence stocks, although South Korea have denied the reports of Kim’s condition. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) also traded lower with underperformance in Hong Kong after social distancing restrictions were extended for 14 days and after the recent sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy with initial gains seen amid the risk averse tone and similar upside in T-notes but with price action only mild as participants also digested mixed results from the 20yr JGB auction which saw a lower b/c and wider tail in price.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are negative across the board following the weak handover from Wall St where sentiment was subdued by the oil market pandemonium in which WTI crude futures plunged and the May contract turned negative for the first time in history, briefly resulting to losses of over 300% and lows of around USD -40/bbl. This was due to the ongoing supply glut and filling storage culminating to a lack of buying interest on a contract which is due for settlement today, although the June futures remained above the USD 20/bbl throughout the chaos and the May contract gradually returned to positive territory. ASX 200 (-1.7%) is weaker with focus on corporate updates including mixed quarterly production numbers from BHP which subsequently weighed on the mining giant and with Virgin Australia going into voluntary administration in an effort to recapitalize amid the government’s refusal to bailout the airline. Nikkei 225 (-1.8%) is pressured by the flows into the currency and the KOSPI (-1.6%) was intially among the worst hit amid uncertainty regarding the geopolitical climate for the Korean peninsula after reports that North Korea leader Kim was in grave danger following cardiovascular surgery which boosted defence stocks, although South Korea have denied the reports of Kim’s condition. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) are also lower with underperformance in Hong Kong after social distancing restrictions were extended for 14 days and after the recent sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer and rose above the 100.00 level as it benefits from its safe-haven status amid the broad risk averse tone which was also not helped by US President Trump’s announcement to sign an executive order to suspend immigration into the US citing the coronavirus outbreak and a need to protect jobs. The greenback’s major counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD falling below 1.0850 but with downside stemmed after the recent initial steps to reopen EU economies, while GBP/USD tests 1.2400 to the downside as the currency remains dampened by the ongoing woeful outlook for the economy. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are subdued by the risk-tone which has also weighed on antipodeans due to their high-beta statuses to push AUD/USD and NZD/USD below the 0.6300 and 0.6000 handles respectively. Furthermore, a 6% decline in Australia jobs for March 14th-April 4th and dovish comments from RBNZ Governor Orr provided no favours for currencies on both sides of the Tasman, while KRW underperformed on the geopolitical uncertainty following conflicting reports of North Korea leader Kim’s condition.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the risk averse tone and similar upside in T-notes but with gains only mild as participants also await the 20yr JGB auction.</p>",
