(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK PM Johnson spokesman said we have proposed a number of backstop proposals to the EU and expect October 17th-18th to be the final chance to achieve a deal. (Newswires)</p><p>EU Commission President Juncker reportedly \"learnt one thing\" from UK PM Johnson which was that his government wants more of an Irish border than the previous, according to ITV's Peston. (Twitter/ITV)</p><p>EU Commission President Juncker said any solution to the backstop must be compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement and the UK are yet to make proposals which meet the objectives of the backstop. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Lane said the incoming information is indicating a more extended slowdown of Euro Area growth dynamics than expected which is predominantly due to external developments and that convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council's aim has slowed recently and partially reversed. Furthermore, Lane said that TLTRO III parameters and the two-tier system for reserve remuneration will ensure lower rates are passed through effectively, while he added APP and reinvestments will adjust dynamically as necessary to inflation outlook changes and is confident that the envisaged purchase volumes will be consistent with current APP parameters for an extended period. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>US President Trump said the US could release oil from its reserves and other countries could be a little more generous supplying oil to bring prices down but also stated that oil prices have not risen that much in the wake of the attack on the Aramco plants, while he also suggested that the spike in oil will not impact US and ultimately won’t affect the world either. (Newswires)</p><p>US Energy Secretary Perry said it is premature to say whether SPR should be used now and that he expects an oil price spike but added the market has a fairly substantial amount of available oil. Furthermore, Perry blamed Iran for the attack and said he is expecting a coalition effort in response to the attacks to put a stop to Iran's 'malign' activities but offered no details. (Newswires)</p><p>Saudi Aramco lost production was said to have been 40% restored on Monday according to Energy Intel industry sources in which one source expects the remaining production to be restored by September-end, although other sources stated that Saudi Aramco's full return to normal levels of oil production may 'take months'. (Newswires)</p><p>Saudi Arabia reportedly shut down the crude oil pipeline which delivers to Bahrain following the oil attacks according to trade sources and there were separate reports that Saudi Aramco officials are said to be considering delaying their IPO as the Co. look for clarity on the damage from over the weekend. (Newswires/WSJ)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US President Trump said diplomacy is never exhausted when it comes to Iran and that he is not looking for a new conflict but sometimes you have to. Trump added that he is in no rush to respond to the attacks and that he agrees with Secretary of State Pompeo on Iran responsibility for the Saudi attacks with the US to decide on a response when we are sure, while he responded that he thinks it would when asked if a military strike on Iran would be proportional to the attack on Saudi oil facilities. (Newswires)</p><p>US Defense Secretary Esper said the US is working with its partners to defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran and the US Envoy to UN told the security council that emerging information on the attacks on Saudi Oil facilities indicate that the responsibility lies with Iran. (Newswires)</p><p>US Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Risch said the Aramco attacks highlights Iranian efforts \"to sow instability\" in the Middle East, while he added that Iran should not underestimate US resolve and any attacks against US forces must be met with \"overwhelming response\". (Newswires)</p><p>Saudi-led Coalition spokesman said initial insight shows that the attack did not come from Yemen and that the weapons were Iranian, while he added investigations are still ongoing and that they have the necessary capacity to defend vital institutions. (Newswires)</p><p>Iranian President Rouhani said the Aramco attacks were a reciprocal response to the aggression against Yemen. In other news, Iran reportedly seized an unidentified vessel traveling through the Persian Gulf for suspected smuggling of diesel fuel. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump said he is probably not inclined to visit North Korea yet, although there were separate comments from the US State Department that the US is ready to resume denuclearization talks with North Korea. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>The energy sector (XOM, CVX, COP) surged with gratitude to the spike higher in oil prices, which sequentially saw airlines (DAL, UAL, AAL, LUV) on the defensive. General Motors (GM) traded lower as its UAW workers went on strike. L3 Harris Technologies (LHX) opened higher after completing a merger-contingent USD 300mln divestment. Both Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) traded firmly after being upgraded to Buy from Hold at HSBC. Raytheon (RTN) opened higher on the back of an upgrade at JPMorgan, citing increased likelihood of its United Technologies (UTX) merger. Defensive names (LMT, RTN) also benefited on rising geopolitical concerns. S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2998, NASDAQ-100 -0.5% at 7852, Dow Jones -0.5% at 27076.</p><p>Treasuries bull-flattened after geopolitical developments and weak China activity data drove a flight into quality, ahead of this week’s FOMC, where the central bank is expected to cut rates by 25bps. T-Note futures gapped higher at the open on Sunday, but then proceeded horizontally through until settlement. The sudden spike in oil prices and geopolitical risk revival has participants concerned on the raised global recession chances, where already protracted manufacturing downturn could be catalysed by sudden spiked energy costs. The Fed has previously identified global developments as a factor within its outlook that has kept it cautious, and while the attacks have contributed to cost-push inflation (not the good kind), markets still do not see any rate move by more than 25bps (around a 70% chance of a 25bps cut, around 30% chance of an unchanged rate decision, according to money markets). At settlement, major curve spreads had narrowed modestly. US T-notes (z9) settled 15+ ticks higher at 129-02.</p>",

US officials were quick to blame Iran, with US President Trump stating that the US was “locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!” Saudi later said that initial insight showed the attacks did not originate in Yemen, that the weapons were Iranian, and it has the necessary capacity to defend vital institutions, but investigations were still ongoing; Iran denied the claims, but President Rouhani did later say the attacks were carried out by the Yemeni people as a result of being oppressed by Saudi Arabia. The Yemen Houthis, who have for months carried out (smaller) drone attacks on Saudi infrastructure, said Aramco was still a target, requesting that companies and foreigners leave the area, as well as for Saudi to stop its efforts against Yemen. The sudden spike higher in energy prices could have wide-ranging effects for global growth, inflation and FX, which would feed its way through into central bank policy, participants will be paying close attention as to whether the disruption will be sustained or more of a one-off. Reports out of Saudi have suggested the majority of Abqaiq facility production could be offline for weeks, and a full return could be months; this is likely to be a best-case scenario provided that no other production becomes affected from conflict in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 8.05 HIGHER AT USD 62.90; BRENT (X9) SETTLES USD 8.80 HIGHER AT USD 69.02: </strong>The geopolitical risk premium in the energy complex has brought itself abruptly into the limelight after the weekend’s attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, following months of global demand growth concerns weighing down prices. The majority of the 5.7mln BPD capacity cut off from the Abqaiq facility (7mln BPD capacity) and Khurais oilfield (1.45mln BPD capacity) being likely to remain offline for weeks, a full return taking months, and potential for more supply disruption down the line saw Brent post its largest ever daily price rise. Futures gapped widely higher on the open on Sunday evening, but came off highs, after traders digested remarks from US President Trump that “if needed”, he has authorised the release of oil from the US’ Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in a “to-be-determined” amount to keep the markets well-supplied. Although it is worth noting that historically the US has released the SPR only a few times, and in co-ordination with the IEA, which has since said that following conversations with Saudi, oil markets are currently well-supplied (echoed by Russia, too). Imminent use of the SPR was also downplayed by US Energy Secretary Perry, who said it was premature to decide whether to use it, adding that the market has a substantial amount of available oil. That oil will likely have to be sourced elsewhere from OPEC production (whether that be its reserves or nations elsewhere; eyes on Shale); Credit Suisse highlights that OPEC spare capacity is a meagre 3.1mln BPD (0.93mln BPD ex-Saudi), short of the 5.7mln BPD suddenly required. RBC’s analysts pose the counter-intuitive notion that the supply outages could manifest into a bearish crude market, where already faltering global demand could be catalysed by the sudden spike in oil prices, due to weakening refining margins, which would only hold up provided end user demand for products picks up.</p><p><strong>* CHINA ECONOMY: </strong>August activity data highlighted the fragile nature of the Chinese economy. Industrial production growth continued to slow, printing 4.4% M/M, short of expectations for 5.2% against July's 4.8%. Retail sales growth slowed to 7.5% Y/Y from 7.6%. China Premier Li said it would be \"very difficult\" for the country to achieve 6% growth given the \"certain downward pressure\" the economy is facing, posing risks to the country's 6-6.5% growth objective. China state media SCMP reported that while the trade war has been commonly blamed for a slowdown which also saw China’s economy grow at its lowest rate on record in Q2, others have pointed to challenges to growth that predate last July, when the first tariffs were enacted, such as the deleveraging campaign that started two years ago to reduce debt and risky lending.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP/FED: </strong>Ahead of the FOMC's policy meeting on Wednesday (where it is expected to cut the FFR target by 25bps), US President Trump once again recycled familiar criticism; Trump tweeted his accusation that China was devaluing its currency and injecting monetary stimulus, and bemoaned higher relative rates in the US, arguing that the \"Fed does not have a clue\". Trump also bemoaned the USD strength’s negative impact on exports.</p><p><strong>* US/EU: </strong>After the WTO ruled that the US can impose tariffs between EUR 5-8bln (possibly up to EUR 10bln) on EU imports into the US (over illegal airline subsidies), Brussels said it was seeking a deal with the US, but the US was showing no signs that it wanted to talk, EU trade chief Malmstrom claimed. Brussels is attempting to reach a trade deal with the US before November in order to avoid auto tariffs that could add further pressure to its manufacturing sector.</p><p><strong>* SEPTEMBER EMPIRE STATE MANUFACTURING: </strong>The headline fell to 2.0 in September from 4.8, and more deeper than the expected fall to 4.0. Nevertheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics says the fall in the headline number is contradicted by higher readings for employment and inventories, though orders and shipments also fell. \"All these numbers are volatile from month-to-month, but the average level of the five components comparable to the ISM manufacturing index rose slightly,\" Pantheon wrote, \"this means that for the second straight month—and the fourth month in the past six, the Empire State numbers point to a clear improvement in the ISM index.\" Pantheon says it is not clear why the Empire State survey should be stronger than the national picture, but it might be in part because NY manufacturing is less dependent on demand from China. \"Either way, the link between the Empire State data and the ISM appears to be broken, at least for now, and we hold out few hopes that the latter is now set for a strong rebound,\" adding that \"manufacturing has been in recession since Q1, and we do not see that changing anytime soon, though the sector is not in meltdown.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Holzmann said he'd support lowering the ECB's price goal, currently 'close to but below 2%', and argued for an open voting system at the policy meetings which would be published in the central bank's meeting accounts. ECB's chief economist Lane largely echoed remarks from ECB President Draghi last, arguing that the ECB's commitment to lifting inflation was unwavering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Monday's talks between the UK and EU have (once again, as expected) failed to reach any meaningful breakthrough, with the EU once again stating that the UK has failed to provide any serious proposals to break the impasse around the Irish backstop issue. Europe once again reiterated that the current arrangement was the only backstop solution. PM Johnson, meanwhile, once again called on the EU to move on the issue. Sources cited by the BBC's Katya Adler said that Dublin would be subject to \"gentle pressure\" from other EU member states if the UK presented a \"realistic\" arrangement, although Adler herself stated that she saw no pressure among EU member states to 'throw Ireland under the bus'.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (Z9) SETTLES 15+ TICKS HIGHER AT AT 129-02.</strong> Treasuries bull-flattened after geopolitical developments and weak China activity data drove a flight into quality, ahead of this week’s FOMC, where the central bank is expected to cut rates by 25bps. T-Note futures gapped higher at the open on Sunday, but then proceeded horizontally through until settlement. The sudden spike in oil prices and geopolitical risk revival has participants concerned on the raised global recession chances, where already protracted manufacturing downturn could be catalysed by sudden spiked energy costs. The Fed has previously identified global developments as a factor within its outlook that has kept it cautious, and while the attacks have contributed to cost-push inflation (not the good kind), markets still do not see any rate move by more than 25bps (around a 70% chance of a 25bps cut, around 30% chance of an unchanged rate decision, according to money markets). At settlement, major curve spreads had narrowed modestly.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2998, NASDAQ-100 -0.5% at 7852, Dow Jones -0.5% at 27076</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -1.3%, Consumer Staples -1%, Energy 3.3%, Financials -0.5%, Health Care -0.2%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology -0.3%, Materials -1.6%, Telecommunication Services -0.8%, Utilities 0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The energy sector (XOM, CVX, COP) surged with gratitude to the spike higher in oil prices, which sequentially saw airlines (DAL, UAL, AAL, LUV) on the defensive. General Motors (GM) traded lower as its UAW workers went on strike. L3 Harris Technologies (LHX) opened higher after completing a merger-contingent USD 300mln divestment. Both Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) traded firmly after being upgraded to Buy from Hold at HSBC. Raytheon (RTN) opened higher on the back of an upgrade at JPMorgan, citing increased likelihood of its United Technologies (UTX) merger. Defensive names (LMT, RTN) also benefited on rising geopolitical concerns.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Oil exporters were firmer today after geopolitical tensions rise in the Middle East; outperformance was seen in the <strong>NOK</strong>, <strong>CAD </strong>and<strong> RUB.</strong> On the flipside, net oil importers were pressured, with <strong>TRY</strong> and <strong>INR</strong> underperforming, the rising USD doing little to help. KRW is also a net importer, and was suffering from the double whammy of oil prices spiking as well as weak China activity data. The attacks spurred a flight to quality, which benefited havens; <strong>XAU</strong> retook the USD 1500 handle, where it consolidated throughout US trade. The <strong>DXY </strong>rose<strong> </strong>back above 98.5, while the JPY was mostly higher (but not against the USD, with USDJPY trading flat around 108.00). <strong>CHF </strong>also firmer against most crosses, however weaker against the greenback.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The geopolitical risk premium in the energy complex has brought itself abruptly into the limelight after the weekend’s attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, following months of global demand growth concerns weighing down prices. The majority of the 5.7mln BPD capacity cut off from the Abqaiq facility (7mln BPD capacity) and Khurais oilfield (1.45mln BPD capacity) being likely to remain offline for weeks, a full return taking months, and potential for more supply disruption down the line saw Brent post its largest ever daily price rise. Futures gapped widely higher on the open on Sunday evening, but came off highs, after traders digested remarks from US President Trump that “if needed”, he has authorised the release of oil from the US’ Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in a “to-be-determined” amount to keep the markets well-supplied. Although it is worth noting that historically the US has released the SPR only a few times, and in co-ordination with the IEA, which has since said that following conversations with Saudi, oil markets are currently well-supplied (echoed by Russia, too). Imminent use of the SPR was also downplayed by US Energy Secretary Perry, who said it was premature to decide whether to use it, adding that the market has a substantial amount of available oil. That oil will likely have to be sourced elsewhere from OPEC production (whether that be its reserves or nations elsewhere; eyes on Shale); Credit Suisse highlights that OPEC spare capacity is a meagre 3.1mln BPD (0.93mln BPD ex-Saudi), short of the 5.7mln BPD suddenly required. RBC’s analysts pose the counter-intuitive notion that the supply outages could manifest into a bearish crude market, where already faltering global demand could be catalysed by the sudden spike in oil prices, due to weakening refining margins, which would only hold up provided end user demand for products picks up.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Euro sags as ECB’s Lane restates case for comprehensive stimulus package",
        "content": "<p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>It’s been a slow and measured grind, but pretty sustained in terms of Eur/Usd’s decline from just shy of 1.1100 to only a few pips off 1.1000 and aided to an extent by dovish comments from ECB’s Lane who underscored the reasons behind last week’s multi-pronged policy easing and downplayed dissent from GC hawks, while expressing confidence that Eur20 bn/month asset purchases within the current APP quotas is consistent with an extended period of buying. Note also, the single currency lost out to the Dollar on safe-haven grounds after the weekend oil site attacks in Saudi Arabia that boosted oil on a combination of supply and geopolitical concerns as Aramco is apparently not that optimistic about restoring the circa 50% output impacted soon and the US points the finger at Iran. Eur/Usd breached chart supports in the form of DMAs on its way down and cleared 1 bn option expiries at 1.1025 before the NY cut, but was right in the middle of a further 1.2 bn from 1.1000-10 at expiry. Similarly, the Pound has steadily depreciated after losing grip of the 1.2500 handle vs the Greenback where 1.2bn expiries sat, but more notably after the press calls from UK PM Johnson meeting with EU’s Juncker, Barnier and his Luxembourg counterpart Bettel. The upshot, little sign of any breakthrough or compromise on the key Irish border plan even though the former claimed that progress has been made and the framework of a new backstop arrangement is there. Cable is currently looking at 1.2400 as Eur/Usd dips through 1.1000.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOK/CAD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>In contrast to the above, the Norwegian Crown is markedly outperforming major peers on the spike in crude prices and with the markets pretty evenly split on whether the Norges Bank hikes by 25 bp on Thursday. Hence, Eur/Nok is now testing bids/support at 9.8700 in contrast to Eur/<strong>SEK</strong> that is pivoting 10.6500 and Usd/Cad hovering near the top of a 1.3267-07 range as the Loonie tussles with broad risk-off sentiment and the supportive oil impulses. Elsewhere, the Yen has been relatively rangebound within 108.05-107.50 confines, but tracking crude inversely like <strong>XAU</strong>, though the <strong>CHF</strong> has remained more mixed and only displaying safe-haven characteristics against the Eur as the cross slipped towards 1.0900 and Usd/Chf extended gains above 0.9900 to circa 0.9940. Note, the SNB also reviews policy this Thursday and consensus ranges from cuts in the new benchmark rate to unchanged, while the latest Swiss sight deposit tally indicates a return to some currency tweaking.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/TRY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A more clear cut and uniform aversion down under as the aforementioned Saudi flare up coupled with disappointing Chinese data/commentary to undermine the Aussie and Kiwi, with Aud/Usd retreating to 0.6855 from around 0.6885 and Nzd/Usd even closer to 0.6350 compared to 0.6390 at one stage as the cross crept back up to 1.0800. Meanwhile, the Lira was hit by the significantly higher cost of oil as an importer and hardly helped by an uptick in Turkey’s quarterly jobless rate and shrinking budget surplus, as Usd/Try hit 5.7400+ at one stage before waning.</p>",

Unsurprisingly, the energy sector is the only one in the green and is posting gains just shy of 3.0% thus far; notable movers within sector include heavyweights BP (+4.0%) and Shell (+2.8%) amongst the gainers, though Tullow Oil (+8.8%) is leading the way. Oil names aside, airlines are feeling the squeeze from the increase in oil prices with the likes of Lufthansa (-2.7%) and easyJet (-2.2%) under pressure. Elsewhere, Airbus (-3.8%) are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following the WTO’s ruling that the US can legally impose tariffs in response to the illegal subsidising of the Co.; which has also resulted in significant downside across luxury names and most notably in LVMH (-3.6%). Other notable movers include, Wirecard (+1.2%) who are topping the Dax (-0.6%) after signing a MoU with UnionPay; while Atlantia (-7.1%) are at the bottom of the FTSE MIB (-1.1%), as the Co. are state they are open to an audit regarding falsified reports concerning viaduct safety and are to investigate whether their own procedures were correctly adhered to.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>NOK/JPY/CAD/NZD/AUD - </strong>The best performing G10 currencies on a mixture of geopolitical and crude factors as attacks on Saudi oil facilities over the weekend cut production and reignited tensions between the US and Iran, with Tehran announcing that President Rouhani will not be seeing Trump on the side-lines of the UN as had been mooted. No surprise that the Norwegian Krona and Loonie are benefiting from the spike in oil prices, along with the RUB, as Eur/Nok straddles 9.9000, Usd/Cad hovers around 1.3250 and the Rouble holds circa 64.000, albeit all some way from the lows seen when crude was at its extreme peaks (Brent almost Usd72 and WTI over Usd63). Meanwhile, the Yen has regained a safe-haven bid alongside XAU (bullion back on the Usd1500 handle) between 108.00-107.50 and decent option expiries from the big figure to 108.15 (1 bn) may also be keeping Usd/Jpy capped. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has regained the initiative down under and got close to 0.6400 vs its US counterpart again, as Aud/Nzd drifted down ahead of 1.0800 and Aud/Usd eased within a 0.6883-60 range amidst sub-forecast Chinese IP and retail sales data that underscored relatively downbeat remarks from Premier Li.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP - </strong>The Franc has pared most of its safe-haven gains vs the Dollar as the <strong>DXY</strong> consolidates off last Friday’s sub-98.000 lows in a 98.038-98.310 band, with Usd/Chf back up near 0.9900 from 0.9865 or so at one stage, but retains a firmer bid vs the Euro ahead of Thursday’s SNB meeting around 1.0950. Latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest a return to FX dabbling, while the single currency is struggling to keep pace with the Greenback after its post-ECB exertions, although Eur/Usd is keeping its head above the 21 DMA (1.1055) and well above expiries sitting at 1.1000-10 (1.2 bn) and 1.1025 (1 bn) in 1.1059-91 parameters. Conversely, the Pound has pull up pretty sharply from best levels of 1.2500 in Cable and circa 0.8855 on the Eur/Gbp cross as UK PM Johnson heads for his first face-to-face meeting with EU’s Juncker to try and hammer out an Irish backstop resolution. Note also, 1.2 bn options expire at 1.2500 and could be weighing on Sterling.</p><p><strong>Notable FX Option Expiries</strong></p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.0990 (1.6BLN), <strong>1.1000-10 (1.2BLN), 1.1025 (1BLN),</strong> 1.1050 (381M), 1.1090-1.1100 (700M), 1.1120-25 (600M)</p><p>- GBP/USD: 1.2440 (614M), <strong>1.2500 (1.2BLN)</strong></p><p>- USD/JPY: 106.50 (700M), 107.35-45 (760M), 107.75-85 (450M), <strong>108.00-15 (1BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Core debt has drifted off best levels, but not before another bout or several waves of buying that saw strong demand for US Treasuries and the longer maturities according to market contacts. Indeed, 10 and 30 year US yields are well over 5 bp below peaks, while Bunds and Gilts have reached fresh intraday highs of 173.13 and 131.77 (+69 and +61 ticks), with the core Eurozone bond breaching a couple of technical resistance levels along the way, and a 50% Fib retracement before crossing 173.00. Although the Saudi spike in oil prices has abated somewhat, latest reports suggest that it could be months before full capacity is restored and the US is still of the opinion that Iran is to blame, hence the renewed safe-haven bid. Ahead, only Empire State of note on the release side, so more post-drone attack developments will be key along with anything market moving ECB speakers and/or Luxembourg on the Brexit front.</p><p>COMMODITIES – Full Analysis Piece Available on the RANsquawk Headline Feed</p><p><strong>Crude futures made their single largest daily gain in history at the reopen of trade on Sunday</strong>, after Iranian-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels attacked critical Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure with drones, taking some 5.7mln bpd of Saudi supply (5% of world) offline; although the complex has since pared gains somewhat. <strong>WTI</strong> Oct’ 19 futures moved as high as USD 63.25/bbl before falling to the low USD 59.0 area per barrel, while <strong>Brent</strong> Nov’ 19 futures reached heights of USD 68.50/bbl, before paring back to the mid USD 65s/bbl. Both hold on to gains north of USD 4.0/bbl and USD 5.0/bbl respectively. Later reports that Saudi Aramco's full return to normal levels of oil production may 'take months' also resulted in some positive ticks for the crude complex. Goldman Sachs hypothesise that, should the outage last 2-6 weeks, they would expect to see a move in Brent prices of between USD 4.0/bbl and USD 14.0/bbl, keeping Brent below USD 75/bbl. Conversely, a net disruption of larger than 4mln BPD for more than three months would likely bring Brent prices above USD 75/bbl, according to the bank. While little is known at the moment about the extent of the damage or the expected duration of the outages, it seems likely that such a successful precision attack on producer as important as Saudi Arabia may result in persistent risk premium. Focus now will turn to what, if any, response occurs from the US side given the tweets from US President Trump and reports illustrating that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards were behind the attack, alongside any measures to alleviate the supply shortage via OPEC+ members. The attack itself has triggered a broader risk off move, which has seen <strong>Gold</strong> prices move back above the USD 1500/oz handle to USD 1512/oz at best. Poor data out of China, where Industrial Output and Retail Sales both disappointed, combined with the more cautious risk appetite, has seen copper underperform. Of note for steel, ING point out that China’s <strong>steel</strong> production recovered 2.2% M/M (+9.3% Y/Y) to 2.81mt per day in August 2019, as falling iron ore prices improved the profitability of steel mills. <strong>Iron ore</strong> prices in China dropped around 25% in August while domestic steel prices were down only around 5-10%. In total, Chinese steel output is up 9.1% YoY to 665mt over the first eight months of the year. Finally, of note for <strong>nickel</strong>; mining operations in the Tawi-Tawi province (nickel producing region) in the Philippines have been suspended on an indefinite basis, according to government officials. The suspension comes amid a review of the local government's mining policy.</p><p><strong>2 Saudi refineries were hit by drone attacks which cut as much as 5.7mln bbls of output or about half of Saudi's daily production.</strong> The attack was claimed to have been conducted by Houthi rebels although US have also pointed the blame at Iran which Iran have denied and think the US could be seeking a pretext to retaliate against Iran. <strong>Sources familiar suggested they are ‘fairly certain’ the attack on Saudi oil facilities was the work of Iranian Revolutionary Guards</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed</strong> at a to be determined amount following the attack on Saudi oil facilities, while he informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other states.

Elsewhere, the Kiwi has regained the initiative down under and got close to 0.6400 vs its US counterpart again, as Aud/Nzd drifted down ahead of 1.0800 and Aud/Usd eased within a 0.6883-60 range amidst sub-forecast Chinese IP and retail sales data that underscored relatively downbeat remarks from Premier Li.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP - </strong>The Franc has pared most of its safe-haven gains vs the Dollar as the <strong>DXY</strong> consolidates off last Friday’s sub-98.000 lows in a 98.038-98.310 band, with Usd/Chf back up near 0.9900 from 0.9865 or so at one stage, but retains a firmer bid vs the Euro ahead of Thursday’s SNB meeting around 1.0950. Latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest a return to FX dabbling, while the single currency is struggling to keep pace with the Greenback after its post-ECB exertions, although Eur/Usd is keeping its head above the 21 DMA (1.1055) and well above expiries sitting at 1.1000-10 (1.2 bn) and 1.1025 (1 bn) in 1.1059-91 parameters. Conversely, the Pound has pull up pretty sharply from best levels of 1.2500 in Cable and circa 0.8855 on the Eur/Gbp cross as UK PM Johnson heads for his first face-to-face meeting with EU’s Juncker to try and hammer out an Irish backstop resolution. Note also, 1.2 bn options expire at 1.2500 and could be weighing on Sterling.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core debt has drifted off best levels, but not before another bout or several waves of buying that saw strong demand for US Treasuries and the longer maturities according to market contacts. Indeed, 10 and 30 year US yields are well over 5 bp below peaks, while Bunds and Gilts have reached fresh intraday highs of 173.13 and 131.77 (+69 and +61 ticks), with the core Eurozone bond breaching a couple of technical resistance levels along the way, and a 50% Fib retracement before crossing 173.00. Although the Saudi spike in oil prices has abated somewhat, latest reports suggest that it could be months before full capacity is restored and the US is still of the opinion that Iran is to blame, hence the renewed safe-haven bid. Ahead, only Empire State of note on the release side, so more post-drone attack developments will be key along with anything market moving ECB speakers and/or Luxembourg on the Brexit front.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Crude futures made their single largest daily gain in history at the reopen of trade on Sunday</strong>, after Iranian-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels attacked critical Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure with drones, taking some 5.7mln bpd of Saudi supply (5% of world) offline; although the complex has since pared gains somewhat. <strong>WTI</strong> Oct’ 19 futures moved as high as USD 63.25/bbl before falling to the low USD 59.0 area per barrel, while <strong>Brent</strong> Nov’ 19 futures reached heights of USD 68.50/bbl, before paring back to the mid USD 65s/bbl. Both hold on to gains north of USD 4.0/bbl and USD 5.0/bbl respectively. Later reports that Saudi Aramco's full return to normal levels of oil production may 'take months' also resulted in some positive ticks for the crude complex. Goldman Sachs hypothesise that, should the outage last 2-6 weeks, they would expect to see a move in Brent prices of between USD 4.0/bbl and USD 14.0/bbl, keeping Brent below USD 75/bbl. Conversely, a net disruption of larger than 4mln BPD for more than three months would likely bring Brent prices above USD 75/bbl, according to the bank. While little is known at the moment about the extent of the damage or the expected duration of the outages, it seems likely that such a successful precision attack on producer as important as Saudi Arabia may result in persistent risk premium. Focus now will turn to what, if any, response occurs from the US side given the tweets from US President Trump and reports illustrating that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards were behind the attack, alongside any measures to alleviate the supply shortage via OPEC+ members. The attack itself has triggered a broader risk off move, which has seen <strong>Gold</strong> prices move back above the USD 1500/oz handle to USD 1512/oz at best. Poor data out of China, where Industrial Output and Retail Sales both disappointed, combined with the more cautious risk appetite, has seen copper underperform. Of note for steel, ING point out that China’s <strong>steel</strong> production recovered 2.2% M/M (+9.3% Y/Y) to 2.81mt per day in August 2019, as falling iron ore prices improved the profitability of steel mills. <strong>Iron ore</strong> prices in China dropped around 25% in August while domestic steel prices were down only around 5-10%. In total, Chinese steel output is up 9.1% YoY to 665mt over the first eight months of the year. Finally, of note for <strong>nickel</strong>; mining operations in the Tawi-Tawi province (nickel producing region) in the Philippines have been suspended on an indefinite basis, according to government officials. The suspension comes amid a review of the local government's mining policy.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NOK/JPY/CAD/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The best performing G10 currencies on a mixture of geopolitical and crude factors as attacks on Saudi oil facilities over the weekend cut production and reignited tensions between the US and Iran, with Tehran announcing that President Rouhani will not be seeing Trump on the side-lines of the UN as had been mooted. No surprise that the Norwegian Krona and Loonie are benefiting from the spike in oil prices, along with the <strong>RUB</strong>, as Eur/Nok straddles 9.9000, Usd/Cad hovers around 1.3250 and the Rouble holds circa 64.000, albeit all some way from the lows seen when crude was at its extreme peaks (Brent almost Usd72 and WTI over Usd63). Meanwhile, the Yen has regained a safe-haven bid alongside <strong>XAU</strong> (bullion back on the Usd1500 handle) between 108.00-107.50 and decent option expiries from the big figure to 108.15 (1 bn) may also be keeping Usd/Jpy capped. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has regained the initiative down under and got close to 0.6400 vs its US counterpart again, as Aud/Nzd drifted down ahead of 1.0800 and Aud/Usd eased within a 0.6883-60 range amidst sub-forecast Chinese IP and retail sales data that underscored relatively downbeat remarks from Premier Li.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>The Franc has pared most of its safe-haven gains vs the Dollar as the <strong>DXY </strong>consolidates off last Friday’s sub-98.000 lows in a 98.038-98.310 band, with Usd/Chf back up near 0.9900 from 0.9865 or so at one stage, but retains a firmer bid vs the Euro ahead of Thursday’s SNB meeting around 1.0950. Latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest a return to FX dabbling, while the single currency is struggling to keep pace with the Greenback after its post-ECB exertions, although Eur/Usd is keeping its head above the 21 DMA (1.1055) and well above expiries sitting at 1.1000-10 (1.2 bn) and 1.1025 (1 bn) in 1.1059-91 parameters. Conversely, the Pound has pull up pretty sharply from best levels of 1.2500 in Cable and circa 0.8855 on the Eur/Gbp cross as UK PM Johnson heads for his first face-to-face meeting with EU’s Juncker to try and hammer out an Irish backstop resolution. Note also, 1.2 bn options expire at 1.2500 and could be weighing on Sterling.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Drone attack leaves 5.7mln bpd of Saudi Arabia crude oil supply offline",
        "content": "<p><strong>THE LATEST:</strong> Early on Saturday morning, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched an unmanned drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s 7mln bpd Adqaiq plant and 1.45mln bpd Khurais oilfield, affecting (according to the Saudi Energy Ministry) 5.7mln bpd worth of crude oil output and 2bcfpd of natural gas production. The disruption has cut Saudi Arabia’s crude oil production by over half and taken 5% of world supply off line, although reports suggested the Kingdom expects to restore a third of the disrupted output on Monday. However, other reports noted that a large percentage of Saudi Arabia's crude that went offline could be lost for some time, according to sources briefed on the situation. Since the attack, Houthi Military spokesman have said that Saudi Aramco plants are still a target, and Saudis should stop their aggression and blockade on Yemen. In response, a number of US officials, including Secretary of State Pompeo, have blamed Iran for the attack, with sources familiar suggesting they are ‘fairly certain’ the attack on Saudi oil facilities was the work of Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Meanwhile, US President Trump tweeted there is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms to proceed, while he tweeted that there is plenty of oil and suggested it is fake news he is willing to meet with Iran without conditions. Iran has denied all accusations. President Trump also authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, at a to be determined amount following the attack, while he informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other states. This morning, Saudi Aramco informed some of their clients that oil loadings are progressing, according to sources. Other OPEC+ members have since come out and indicated a willingness to increase output in the short-term to make up for the shortfall; Russian Energy Minister Novack said he is contact with Saudi officials but played down the need for an immediate OPEC+ meeting.</p><p><strong>MARKET IMPLICATIONS: </strong>Crude futures made their single largest daily gain in history at the reopen, but have since pared gains somewhat; WTI Oct’ 19 futures moved as high as USD 63.25, but have since pared gains to USD 59.15, while Brent Nov’ 19 futures moved as high as USD 68.50 before paring to USD 65.50. Both hold on to gains of USD 4.30 and USD 5.25 respectively on the day. The extreme move in the crude market has naturally had implications on other markets. In terms of equities; the energy sector is the outperformer, while airlines have suffered on higher fuel prices. Petro-currencies, such as NOK, CAD and RUB are all firmer, while energy importers, including TRY, INR and KRW are weaker. More broadly, the attack itself has triggered a broad risk off move; global equity indices are lower, bonds higher and haven currencies and gold bid, as markets price in the higher geopolitical risk premia that this escalation in Middle Eastern tensions presents. ING think that how bullish developments are for the crude complex depends on how long the outage lasts. Recent reports suggested that production could return to normal in a matter of days which if true, the bank argues, means the upside seen in prices is more a reflection risk premium rather than a significant tightening in the market. However, any indication or confirmation from the Saudis of a prolonged outage could see Brent trading back above USD 70 per barrel in the near term, they argue. “It is not just the flat price that is poised to move higher”, ING say, “nearby time spreads are also likely to move deeper into backwardation, reflecting the tightening in the prompt physical market. OPEC+ production cuts in recent months have already been supportive for spreads, and this latest development will likely only give them a further boost higher.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week cautious as oil prices surge and geopolitical concerns heighten following drone attacks on Saudi refineries which shut down 5.7mln bbls or more than half of the kingdom’s production. Furthermore, the US are pointing the blame on Iran which the latter has denied, while disappointing Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data, as well as this week’s heavy slate of central bank activity adds to the tentative tone. ASX 200 (Unch.) is indecisive as weakness in the broader market is counterbalanced by strong gains in commodity-related sectors, especially energy stocks after oil prices briefly spiked as much as 20% due to the attacks on OPEC’s largest producer and although it expects to restore a third of the disrupted output today, some sources suggested a large percentage of the offline crude could be lost for some time. Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are mixed with underperformance in Hong Kong following another weekend of violent protests and with the mainland choppy as disappointing data and downbeat comments on China’s economy from Premier Li, fuel stimulus hopes and with the PBoC’s previously announced 50bps RRR cut taking effect today. As a reminder, Japanese markets remain shut for Respect for the Aged Day.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is softer with price action lacklustre ahead of this week’s busy central bank roster headlined by the Fed on Wednesday in which markets are pricing an 89% probability of a 25bps cut and with focus to also be on the latest dot plot projections. The greenback’s major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD little changed below 1.1100 and GBP/USD pulling back from its recent outperformance after hitting resistance at the 1.2500 handle, while UK PM Johnson remains unwavering as believes he can strike an EU deal within weeks but reiterated the UK will leave on October 31st deal or no-deal, while EU officials denied PM Johnson's claims there has been real signs of movement and that huge progress was being made on removing the backstop. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is lower as the geopolitical concerns spurs safe-haven flows, and antipodeans trade indecisive as they digest a firmer than expected PBoC reference rate and disappointing Chinese data.</p>",
