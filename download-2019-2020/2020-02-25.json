The bid in the T-Note caught traction as US participants came to the scene, following on from the Europe session where the Bund dropped beneath the -0.50% level for the first time this year, meanwhile later in the session the US 10-year yield briefly printed all time record lows. Typical haven flows into Treasuries were observed as equities treaded lower, the Treasury supply this week in the front-to-belly doesn’t appear to be dissuading investors either, where markets continue to price in further chances of FOMC cuts this year. The 2-year auction on the outset could be considered weak, tailing by 1.6bps, covering below its six-auction average and dealers taking a significant cut of the takedown. Although more widely, the 2-year Note, as the rest of the curve, has been on a big rally this week, where auction participants could perceive valuations as rich in the near term ahead of more concrete data from COVID-19. By settlement, the curve had bull steepened with the 2-year yield -7bps and 30-year -5bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX -3.03% at 3128, NDQ -2.7% at 8835, DJIA -3.15% at 27,081</strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: Home Depot (HD) opened higher after a strong quarter and dividend raise.

Note that it wasn't until US participants came to the scene that the risk aversion really continued. The SPX fell beneath 3,200 and now sits below 3,150, while the DJIA tested 27,000 to the downside, the sell-off gained traction shortly after the US equity open after a US health official announced the likelihood of further COVID-19 outbreaks, and indices continued to the downside, breaking through several technical levels. Yields mirrored the equity move, where the Bund broke beneath -0.50% and the 10-year yield briefly broke beneath its all-time low of 1.321%, while the curve bull-flattened as investors' expectations of Fed rate cuts grow. The lower energy prices, falling global growth expectations and lower yields saw Energy, Materials, Industrials and Financials underperform the most, although all sectors were in the red - less than ten stocks made gains in the SPX.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19: </strong>The WHO stated the coronavirus is a rapidly escalating epidemic in places, and that the virus needs to be tackled super-fast to prevent a pandemic. Although it did note that China is probably not missing a huge amount of cases and asymptomatic transmission does not seem to be a big factor. In the US, Health Secretary Azar believes there will likely be more cases and that the US has a stockpile of ventilators and masks but not enough for the outbreak, although there is no reports yet of potential shortages of prescription drugs due to the virus. Meanwhile the CDC echoed the WHO noting it is rapidly evolving and expanding, adding Americans should prepare for possible spreads in communities. Cases continued to rise in China, however outside of China saw South Koreas confirmed cases slow to 60 new cases, lower than the from the drastic rise previously. Meanwhile in Europe, cases continued to spread with Italy reporting 11 deaths and cases continued to rise to over 300. Despite this, the health minister noted that there is a commitment by countries which border Italy to keep borders open. Elsewhere, France reported two new cases, Austria confirmed its first two cases as did Spain who saw two cases, with one of which in Catalonia. Switzerland reported its first official case.</p><p><strong>* VIRUS FUNDS:</strong> Late Monday, the Trump administration sent to Congress a USD 2.5bln supplemental budget request for additional money to fight the coronavirus, Politico reported. The request proposes using untouched money that has not been used, well as new money, totalling over USD 2bln, according to a source, of which over USD 1bln will go toward vaccine development and the other money will give HHS the flexibility to spend the cash as it sees fit, from stockpiling masks to paying for diagnostics. In Italy, where the number of COVID19 deaths rose to seven on Monday, may have flexibility around budgets amid the virus, deputy economy minister said, noting that the EU has resources in cases where economic events impact GDP, and should offer leeway.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE:</strong> The trade deal struck in January commits China to purchasing USD 200bln of goods and services over a two-year period, and analysts have argued that to achieve that level, many of China's existing retaliatory tariffs would need to be reduced or scrapped. China's MOF has recently allowed firms to apply for exemptions on tariffs of US goods from 2nd March, and analysts have suggested that crude oil, soybeans, machinery and equipment are likely to feature heavily in these exemption requests. Goldman Sachs has said that this suggests that the deal still looks on track, although probably delayed by the viral outbreak, which is consistent with the statements by officials on both sides. The USDA and USTR reported progress on implementation of US-China Phase One deal, noting the bank of imports on US poultry and poultry products has been lifted. Meanwhile, NEC Director Kudlow when asked if China can make its commitments to the US now its economy is struggling, says it is so far only struggling in Q1 and will see what happens after then.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER COFNIDENCE (FEB): </strong>Consumer confidence rose by less than expected in February, to 130.7 from a downwardly revised 130.4; analysts were expecting a rise to 132.0. Nevertheless, the index rose to the highest since August, with the future conditions driving the upside. However, the present conditions metric eased a touch, with the differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' declined to 29.8, which is a marginal negative heading into next week's payrolls report. \"The widening global outbreak of the coronavirus might have a marked impact on consumer confidence levels in the coming months, but for now consumers’ attitudes appear to be largely immune to the virus.,\" Oxford Economics said. Consumers see inflation at 4.6% in 12-months, up from the 4.4% seen in the previous survey.</p><p><strong>* RICHMOND FED (FEB):</strong> The Richmond Fed's gauge of manufacturing conditions fell by more than expected, falling to -2 from 20; analysts were looking for a fall to 10.0. The data was surprising, since regional Fed gauges of manufacturing have surprised to the upside, of late (for instance, Philly Fed, Empire Fed, and this week the Dallas Fed's manufacturing gauge), and chimes more with the Markit gauge of manufacturing released last week, which seems to be more representative of the national landscape, and disappointed. Analysts will be paying particular attention to the manufacturing releases ahead of the release of the manufacturing ISM on 2nd March. The Fed seems to be of the view that manufacturing has bottomed, and officials have expressed satisfaction with where policy settings currently are. If the consumer momentum is cooling, and its assumptions about manufacturing are challenged, it may give credence to market pricing which looks for rate cuts this year (61bps of easing is now priced through the end of this year; that compares to around 30bps after the recent FOMC meeting, and 40bps at the end of last week!).</p><p><strong>* NEC DIRECTOR KUDLOW: </strong>In a CNBC interview, said that the US is ahead of the curve in laying out emergency plans for COVID-19, and doesn't believe it will turn out to be an economic tragedy \"at all\", stating that the US has the virus contained. Kudlow said the emergency measures taken are appropriate, but they may not be put into place. The NEC Director noted that the US can avoid a recession, even if the rest of the world were to fall into one, and that long-term investors should buy the US stock market. When asked about whether China will be able to make its purchase commitments from the US now that its economy is struggling, Kudlow stressed the transitory nature of the struggle, which he says so far is just limited to Q1 and that the US will see what happens after.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Clarida stated US economy and monetary policy are in a good place, and that it is still too soon to speculate on whether the coronavirus will lead to a material change in US economic outlook, noting the Fed is closely monitoring the outbreak. Clarida reiterated the Fed’s guidance that as long as incoming information remains broadly consistent with Fed's outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate. He noted disruption from the virus could spill over to the global economy and that it will likely have a noticeable impact on Chinese growth, at least in Q1. Participants had been eyeing his speech to see if there were any indication on potential easing from the Fed as a result of the coronavirus given Fed pricing has increased recently and is now expecting over 50bps worth of easing by the end of the year. However, Clarida in remarks prior to these, had poured cold water on market pricing, noting he prefers to look at the bank expectations. This time round Clarida reiterated Fed guidance and noted the current policy stance remains appropriate, providing no hints of easing. Note,<strong> </strong>NEC Director Kudlow, in his CNBC interview, said he had not heard of any talk both privately or publicly of any potential FOMC rate cuts as a result of the virus.</p><p><strong>* FED DISCOUNT MINUTES:</strong> All 12 banks voted to keep the discount rate unchanged and would keep it such barring a material change to the US outlook. Federal Reserve Bank directors continued to view current economic conditions as favourable and expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace. Many directors reported solid to robust levels of consumer spending. Directors in several Districts noted that low interest rates had provided a boost to residential real estate markets, as evidenced by the growth in mortgage lending and refinancing. Reports on the strength of commercial lending were mixed. Manufacturing was generally soft, although some directors reported modest improvements in the sector. Labour market conditions generally remained strong. Several directors highlighted ongoing difficulties finding and retaining workers across most sectors and skill levels, resulting in wage increases and expanded non-wage benefits. Some directors continued to note downside risks stemming from trade policy and other uncertainties. Inflation remained below the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Villeroy (hawkish) said that the coronavirus is predominantly a supply-side shock and therefore the adequacy of any monetary policy response should not be overstated; adding that the impact on growth will be negative but temporary. Note that following the comments there was some perceived strength in EURUSD.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 1.53 LOWER AT USD 49.90/bbl; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 1.35 LOWER AT USD 54.95/bbl: </strong>Energy markets continued their March lower on Tuesday, again as growing COVID-19 cases globally deepen concerns over global demand and risk appetite which saw WTI and Brent fall beneath USD 50 and USD 55/bbl, respectively. The crude complex found its way lower throughout the session alongside US equities. IEA’s Birol said the group may need to cut its oil demand growth forecast again, saying the estimate is at the lowest it has been in the previous ten years. Whilst the virus outbreak deepens, supply side updates remain out of vogue for participants somewhat, although Saudi Aramco CEO said he sees minimal impact on the Co amid the demand fall, while Libyan production remains significantly lower than capacity at 122k BPD. Note that Brent April options expire on Tuesday at settlement. Looking ahead, participants await the latest US energy inventories, with private inventory data released on Tuesday evening ahead of the official release on Wednesday; current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +2mln, Distillates -1.7mln and Gasoline -2.2mln.</p><p><strong>* US-T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLE 15 TICKS HIGHER AT 133.04.</strong> The TPLEX marched higher, particularly in the front-end, with COVID-19 continuing to see investors re-evaluate global growth, central bank policy and haven flows. The bid in the T-Note caught traction as US participants came to the scene, following on from the Europe session where the Bund dropped beneath the -0.50% level for the first time this year, meanwhile later in the session the US 10-year yield briefly printed all time record lows. Typical haven flows into Treasuries were observed as equities treaded lower, the Treasury supply this week in the front-to-belly doesn’t appear to be dissuading investors either, where markets continue to price in further chances of FOMC cuts this year. The 2-year auction on the outset could be considered weak, tailing by 1.6bps, covering below its six-auction average and dealers taking a significant cut of the takedown. Although more widely, the 2-year Note, as the rest of the curve, has been on a big rally this week, where auction participants could perceive valuations as rich in the near term ahead of more concrete data from COVID-19. By settlement, the curve had bull steepened with the 2-year yield -7bps and 30-year -5bps.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed) and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu). UBS notes there will be USD 91bln of cashflows this week (Ex SOMA), including around USD 82bln of redemptions, and USD 9bln of coupons, implying supply of around USD 22bln.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The 5-year lacks set up from a relative value perspective, analysts at SocGen wrote, and the current 5-year note trades cheap in asset swap versus older 5s, though appears fair on the fly versus 2s and 10s.\"The 2s5s curve, which is inverted currently, has flattened meaningfully since January,\" SocGen writes, \"this richness on curve might dissuade some relative-value seekers from participating in the 5y auction.\" SocGen says that the flight-to-quality has richened the 5-year sector extensively on an outright basis, which might further suppress demand. Meanwhile, it notes that the current WI for the 5 is well below the stop-yields of all auctions since September 2016. With that said, the bank reminds us that demand for the 5-year sector in repo might marginally support demand for the auction. SocGen says it is negative on Wednesday's 5-year auction.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -3.03% at 3128, NDQ -2.7% at 8835, DJIA -3.15% at 27,081</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -4.3%, Technology -3.2%, Cons Disc -2.6%, Communication Svs -2.4%, Financials -3.4%, Health -3%, Industrials -4%, Materials -4.3%, Cons Stpl -1.75%, Real Estate -2.6%, Utilities -2.16%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Home Depot (HD) opened higher after a strong quarter and dividend raise. McDonald’s (MCD) was supported by a US SSS Q1 estimate raise at Cleveland research. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) tumbled lower as it reported a disappointing quarter and cut its guidance. While both Keysight Technologies (KEYS) and Intuit (INTU) caught a bid on decent quarterly reports. Mastercard (MA) underperformed after a guidance cut, weighing on American Express (AXP) too. COVID-19 continued to cause risk aversion, albeit not till later in the session, particularly in the more directly vulnerable stocks such as airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL) - note United withdrew its guidance today – hotels/casinos (MAR, HLT, WYNN, MLCO), semiconductors (SOX, AMD, INTC, QCOM). Lower crude oil prices weighed on the energy sector (XOP, XLE). Moderna (MRNA) made double digit gains as investors were pleased to see its fast progress in sending COVID-19 treatments for testing in the US.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The EU officially adopted its negotiating mandate for trade talks with the UK; the UK will publish its version on Thursday. Are Sterling markets too complacent about EU trade talks? Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks so. If the UK and EU do not strike a trade deal by the end of the year, both will automatically trade with each other on WTO terms in 2021, which Pantheon believes would probably push the UK into a shallow recession. The UK has settled obligations to the EU, so there is a possibility of mini-deals to soften the blow, though these would likely be patchy and temporary. Pantheon says it sees no evidence that the risk of a WTO-terms Brexit at the end of this year is seriously priced-in by markets. \"Expectations for three-month LIBOR in December are only 2.5bps lower than in September, equating to a 10% chance that Bank Rate will be lower in Q1 2021 than in Q4. Given that it is widely accepted that the MPC likely would ease in the event of no-deal, this suggests markets see only a 10% chance that no trade deal is agreed.\" And in addition, PM notes investors are currently net long sterling, having collectively shorted the currency before the March and October Brexit deadlines, and risk reversals imply that demand for insuring against a depreciation of sterling at the 9- and 12-month horizons is the lowest it has been since mid-2014. Pantheon sees an eventual Canada-style FTA. The UK has said that there is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, although the EU is insisting that such a \"level playing field\" is essential for a Canada-style deal, and that the looser requirements imposed on Canada cannot apply to a deal with the UK, given its interconnectedness with the EU economy.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY GDP: </strong>The second report for Q4 saw growth at 0.3%, in line with the consensus and the advanced. The details revealed that household consumption stalled in Q4, government consumption edged up, construction investment was up a decent amount. However, net exports were a drag, and investment in machinery and equipment saw a hefty fall again. Desks note that business surveys do not suggest a pick-up in growth anytime soon, though the industrial sector may not suffer as badly as in Q4. Capital Economics said any impact of the coronavirus on the German economy via supply-chain disruption or reduced demand from China has been small so far, but the longer the disruption in China continues the greater the risks. Additionally, the possibility of the virus spreading in Europe poses a new downside risk. \"Overall, we suspect that GDP will continue to stagnate during the first half of this year due to a combination of weak global demand and falling domestic investment. After expanding by 0.6% last year, we forecast that the economy will only grow by 0.2% this year.\"</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>DXY</strong>&nbsp;continued to lose ground today and crossed 99.000 to the downside as coronavirus fears continued to spook markets - which has driven yields lower with the 10-year briefly printing an all-time record low, spurring an increase in market pricing for Fed rate cuts, which currently see 50bps worth of easing by year end.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;continued to regain ground as participants flocked to the Yen, further cementing its safe-haven status after doubts last week. For the&nbsp;<strong>CHF,</strong>&nbsp;however, the haven properties of its currency is likely to be an irritation for the SNB, which appears to be defending the EUR/CHF 1.0600 mark (the SNB does not provide specific levels, but price action during the risk-off would suggest intervention to stem CHF strength), note EUR/CHF regained 1.0600 in afternoon trade as the single currency gained traction boosted by&nbsp;<strong>USD</strong>&nbsp;weakness. However,&nbsp;<strong>XAU</strong>&nbsp;was an outlier and traded with losses of USD ~10, desks noted heavy selling activity which speculated that if the risk appetite were to turn around, perhaps the precious metal sell off would be exacerbated. After hitting multi-year lows last week,&nbsp;<strong>EUR</strong>&nbsp;stabilisation has been helped by decent PMI on Friday (under the hood, it might be telling a different story), and better than expected German Ifo data this week and unrevised German GDP data. However, early selling was seen as the coronavirus cases continue to expand across Europe, but USD weakness helped reverse the losses and EUR/USD tested 1.0900 to the upside.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>: the better data has improved the prospects for the Pound, which now enters the window of Brexit headline risk, as the Europeans announce their negotiating position ahead of the UK doing the same on Thursday. Talks are likely to be contentious, leaving downside risk for&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>. Some even think markets are overestimating the prospects of a deal (see Brexit section). Meanwhile, today’s price action saw Sterling firmer against both&nbsp;<strong>USD&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong>ahead of the talks, as the Pound benefits from some technical tailwinds with Cable crossing 1.3000 briefly at the tail-end of trade.&nbsp;<strong>CAD</strong>&nbsp;is proving to be resilient amid the risk slide. Crude remains off February lows, while data surprises have been improving in Canada. Friday's GDP report for Q4/December is key - the BOC said it needs to see evidence that the growth slowdown is persistent in order to justify rate cuts, and as such, the GDP data will have relevance for BOC policy.&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;stabilised off multi-year lows and resided above 0.6600 and&nbsp;<strong>NZD&nbsp;</strong>also meandered around 0.6350, although weakness is still seen as risk appetite deteriorates, putting NZD/USD at 0.6320 heading into APAC trade. Note, ANZ bank argues that the fallout from COVID-19 would not be too intense on the NZ economy, which is well-positioned to handle any short-term blips out of China, although the longer the crisis persists, the more damaging the impact to Kiwi economy could be. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>KRW</strong>&nbsp;snapped a run of six days of losses as the pace of new cases slowed in the region.</p>",

The bid in the T-Note caught traction as US participants came to the scene, following on from the Europe session where the Bund dropped beneath the -0.50% level for the first time this year, meanwhile later in the session the US 10-year yield briefly printed all time record lows. Typical haven flows into Treasuries were observed as equities treaded lower, the Treasury supply this week in the front-to-belly doesn’t appear to be dissuading investors either, where markets continue to price in further chances of FOMC cuts this year. The 2-year auction on the outset could be considered weak, tailing by 1.6bps, covering below its six-auction average and dealers taking a significant cut of the takedown. Although more widely, the 2-year Note, as the rest of the curve, has been on a big rally this week, where auction participants could perceive valuations as rich in the near term ahead of more concrete data from COVID-19. By settlement, the curve had bull steepened with the 2-year yield -7bps and 30-year -5bps.</li></ul>",

IEA’s Birol said the group may need to cut its oil demand growth forecast again, saying the estimate is at the lowest it has been in the previous ten years. Whilst the virus outbreak deepens, supply side updates remain out of vogue for participants somewhat, although Saudi Aramco CEO said he sees minimal impact on the Co amid the demand fall, while Libyan production remains significantly lower than capacity at 122k BPD. Note that Brent April options expire on Tuesday at settlement. Looking ahead, participants await the latest US energy inventories, with private inventory data released on Tuesday evening ahead of the official release on Wednesday; current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +2mln, Distillates -1.7mln and Gasoline -2.2mln.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains mixed vs major currency counterparts and to a large extent reliant on others for direction in the ongoing absence of anything pivotal in terms of US data or direct Fed policy guidance. On that note, pricing for the June FOMC is already fully factoring in a 25 bp ease anyway and leaning a tad towards ½ point, mainly if not entirely due to perceptions that China’s coronavirus will have a severe adverse impact on the country’s economy with knock-on effects for global growth and its ability to adhere to Phase 1 of the trade deal with the US. However, the <strong>DXY </strong>is holding safely above 99.000 and support just ahead of the big figure (99.074 represents a Fib retracement from 2020 peak to trough from December last year) within a 99.392-120 range by virtue of Greenback gains against the more risk sensitive, bar the still outperforming Pound.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, Cable is an outlier, albeit not alone as Sterling advances across the board awaiting the start of UK-EU trade talks in earnest and with the Pound benefiting from some positive if not quite bullish technical tailwinds. Indeed, Eur/Gbp has retraced further from recent 0.8400+ highs through 0.8350 and Cable looks poised to retest resistance around 1.3000 having survived another test of underlying bids at or below 1.2900.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The other clear G10 winners as the Yen rebounds to almost 110.00 amidst heightened jitters over the mounting tally of coronavirus cases and growing number of countries reporting people infected with COVID-19, while the Franc has caught a firmer bid since confirmation that Switzerland has now witnessed contamination. Usd/Chf has been just below 0.9765 and Eur/Chf only a few pips shy of August 2015 lows that were matched on Monday when risk aversion was arguably more intense.</p><p><strong>NOK/NZD</strong></p><p>In contrast to the traditional safe-havens, renewed risk-off flows and weakness in oil prices have hit the Norwegian Krona and Kiwi pretty hard, as Eur/Nok soaks up offers over 10.1600 on the way to a near 10.2000 high and Nzd/Usd recoils from 0.6350+ to revisit bids protecting 0.6300.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/CAD/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck, as the single currency continues to straddle 1.0850 amidst the rise in coronavirus cases in Italy and evolving across Europe, while the Aussie clings to 0.6600 and takes some solace from a relatively resilient Yuan in wake of more attempts to ease the financial/economic burden of local business struggling to cope with the contagious effects of the outbreak (Usd/Chh capped circa 7.0300). Elsewhere, the Loonie is also holding up quite well above 1.3300 awaiting comments from BoC’s Lane for some independent impetus, while the Swedish Crown is still churning around 10.5600 vs the Euro following mixed to dovish Riksbank rhetoric.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Little respite for regional currencies given the overall downturn in risk sentiment and with the Zar treading cautiously ahead of tomorrow’s SA budget around 15.2400, while the Try has not recovered much poise via upbeat comments from the CBRT ahead of talks with Russia on Idlib in Syria also scheduled for Wednesday, as its remains well below 6.0000.</p>",

However, US equity futures have experienced a modest relief rally since the open as the contracts retraced some of their recent losses.

(Newswire)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>The attempted recovery for European equities from yesterday’s sharp sell-off ran out of steam in early trade with investors unwilling to buy up stocks amidst a backdrop of the increasing coronavirus case count across the globe. Despite prospective aid packages from various global powers, focus remains on the mounting case count as the virus continues to spread throughout Italy, the death toll rises in South Korea and Iran, whilst other nations report their first diagnosis’ of COVD-19. In a note published earlier today, Nomura Quants highlights that although it would be unwise to try and reach conclusions based on a single day’s change in sentiment (yesterday), investors are likely reacting to the increasing prospect that the COVID-19 outbreak could lead to a global economic collapse, compared to the initial belief that it would likely only lead to a momentary depressive impact. As such, European bourses are enduring another session of losses (Eurostoxx 50 -1.0%), albeit to a less extent than yesterday. That said, momentum to the downside for European equities has been accelerating with the DAX Mar’20 future taking out yesterday’s low (12961) and the Feb low (12958) to briefly breach a key double-bottom/fib level at 12880.5. Sectoral performance is negative with not too much in the way of specific underperformance. In terms of stock specifics, Prudential (+1.6%) shares have been supported by Third Point disclosing a 5% stake in the Co. and urging them to sperate its Asian and US businesses, whilst Anglo American (+0.4%) shares have been underpinned by recommendations from shareholder advisory groups ISS and Glass Lewis that Sirius shareholders accept the Anglo’s proposed takeover. To the downside, auto/autoparts makers continue to remain out of favour (Continental -2.9%, Michelin -2.3%, Renault -1.8%), whilst Novartis (-3.4%) shares have been weighed on by concerns over the safety of one of its eye drugs and AB Inbev (-2.9%) are enduring losses in the wake of a broker downgrade at HSBC. Furthermore, Philips (-2.9%) shares are lower after the company warned coronavirus is expected to have a negative impact on Q1 performance (albeit it is too early to quantify at this stage), whilst COVID-19 also forced Mastercard (-4.4% pre-market) to cut Q1 guidance and United Airlines (-3.3% pre-market) withdrew all previously issued 2020 guidance.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP/JPY </strong>- Notwithstanding heightened hard Brexit prospects heading into trade talks between the UK and EU, Sterling has recouped more lost ground vs the Euro and Dollar to sit on top of the G10 table ahead of the CBI’s Distributive trades survey and Brussels unveiling its mandate for the impending negotiations.

Spanish Bonos not immune, but holding up better as demand for 30 year paper builds and guidance tightens, albeit not to the extent of the recent record syndication. The 10 year German benchmark has drifted back from 176.02, though remains bid and outperforming Gilts at 135.17 at best and USTs reaching 132-30 before topping out.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding heightened hard Brexit prospects heading into trade talks between the UK and EU, Sterling has recouped more lost ground vs the Euro and Dollar to sit on top of the G10 table ahead of the CBI’s Distributive trades survey and Brussels unveiling its mandate for the impending negotiations. The Pound’s revival looks partly technical and perhaps as a bi-product of cross positioning, as Cable held above 1.2900 before breaching the 100 DMA (circa 1.2955) and is now testing the 21 DMA (1.2988) that stands in the way of 1.3000, while Eur/Gbp has pulled back from 0.8400+ towards 0.8350. Similarly, the Yen has regained momentum after containing declines against the Buck to 111.00 or thereabouts, and with more depth in the market following the return of Japanese participants from Monday’s Emperor’s Birthday holiday. However, the main catalyst is another downturn in sentiment amidst a growing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities stretching further across the globe, with Usd/Jpy inching closer to yesterday’s safe-haven lows and stops said to be sitting down to 110.25.</p><p><strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs the Greenback and back above 0.9800, while Eur/Chf is eying 1.0600 again on the back of renewed risk aversion and with the Franc largely unfazed by a marginal decline in Swiss payrolls. Meanwhile, <strong>GOLD </strong>looks a bit more stable after suffering a rather sharp and abrupt fall almost as sudden and large as its spike to almost Usd1690/oz amidst the aforementioned deteriorating risk tone.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has retreated from 0.6350+ levels against its US counterpart and near 1.4000 vs the Aussie to prop up the major ranks even though the latter has lost grip of the 0.6600 handle against the Usd and potentially has more to lose from China’s nCoV outbreak and fallout. Elsewhere, the Euro has also handed back gains vs the Buck after failing to sustain 1.0850+ territory and the Loonie is pivoting 1.3300 again as crude prices slip ahead of API inventories. All this helping to keep the <strong>DXY </strong>afloat within a 98.120-392 range.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Somewhat conflicting commentary from the Riksbank for the Sek to digest, as Floden continues to discount soft inflation, but Jansson sounding more concerned especially given the coronavirus and perhaps almost intimating that a reservation should have been entered again. Elsewhere, it’s back to general depreciation, albeit off the troughs seen at the height of aversion on Monday, as the Mxn awaits GDP and IGAE at noon, while the Brl gets current account data 30 minutes later.</p>",

US indices closed with sharp losses on Monday over fears regarding the number of growing coronavirus cases outside of China, causing the S&amp;P and Dow to wipe out their YTD gains, with the latter closing lower by over 1000 points. However, US equity futures have experienced a modest relief rally since the open as the contracts retraced some of their recent losses. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-1.6%) remained subdued, albeit off lows, as mining and banking names still bore the brunt of the prior session’s decline in base metals and yields. Nikkei 225 (-3.4%) opened with losses of ~4.5% as the benchmark played catch-up to the recent events after its extended weekend, including a firmer JPY. The Japanese index later clambered off lows amid the abating risk aversion, and with Fujifilm Holdings’ shares soaring almost 9% at the open on Japan’s plans to recommend its Avigan drug, produced by a Fujifilm unit, as a coronavirus treatment. That being said, Japanese automakers experienced firm losses on the outbreak’s implications on sales and supply chains; (Nissan -3.9%, Toyota -3.0%, and Mitsubishi -3.4%). Elsewhere, KOSPI (+1.1%) stood as the outperformer after the index consolidated from the prior session’s hefty losses before being bolstered by a declining rate of COVID-19 cases in the country. Furthermore, reports stated that South Korea is to draft a supplementary budget as soon as possible, whilst the government is also taking containment measures in Daegu and North Gyeongsang provinces to prevent further spreading. Over in China, the Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp (-1.4%) traded mixed, with the former balancing gains in tech and pharma against losses in financials and oil giants. Meanwhile, Mainland lagged amid a lack of fresh China stimulus and with the PBoC also skipping open market operations for a sixth consecutive day.</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>Banking Names – </strong>BoE Chief Economist Haldane has suggested that legislative change should be made in order to move corporate governance rules away from their current entire focus on shareholders to encompass consumers and workers as well.

Meanwhile, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> seemed to be tracking gains in US equity futures for most of the session before the pair found resistance at the psychological 111.00 mark, and Japanese participants back in the market following their extended weekend. Finally, <strong>CNH</strong> experienced mild strength in light of firmer Yuan fixing by the PBoC vs. expectations for a weaker setting – <strong>USD/CNH</strong> moved lower from around 7.0300 to test 7.0100 to the downside before stabilising around 7.0200.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Commodities largely consolidated from the prior day’s substantial price action</strong>, with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures finding bases around USD 50.50/bbl and USD 55.20/bbl respectively before advancing over a USD 1/bbl each from those levels.

Curve spreads were more modestly changed, however. Growing expectations of sooner than previously expected Fed policy easing is likely supporting the front-end (market pricing has more than 50bps of cuts through year-end) just as much as growth concerns/haven flows keep duration supported. The front-to-belly is also being strongly supported in face of large Treasury supply this week (USD 113bln across 2s, 5s, and 7s), clearly not something that is dissuading investors. By settlement 10-year yield had fallen 9bps to 1.379%, while the 2-year had fallen 8.5bps, leaving the 2s10s spread at 11.5bps.</p><p><strong>Fed's Mester (Voter, Hawk)</strong> reiterated monetary policy in the US is well calibrated and added there are risks to US outlook including the impact of nCoV but expects US economy to continue to perform well. 2020 outlook is for the expansion to continue with growth around trend, a solid labour market, and low and stable inflation. Mester sees PCE inflation returning to 2% target gradually over the next year or two and does not at this time support cutting rates to spur a faster return to its inflation goal. Mester also noted that it is very difficult to assess the risk to the US economy of the coronavirus.

Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices fell 3% at one point before ending the session 1.5% lower, snapping a 10-day winning streak amid renewed demand woes having side-lined recent supply concerns.</p><p>Saudi Aramco CEO only expects a short-term impact on oil demand from the coronavirus, noting he is confident oil demand will improve in H2, particularly in China.

Abrams noted that it will warn before sanction those involved in the Venezuelan oil sector in the coming weeks or months. US is looking at customers of Venezuelan oil, primarily in Asia.

Curve spreads were more modestly changed, however. Growing expectations of sooner than previously expected Fed policy easing is likely supporting the front-end (market pricing has more than 50bps of cuts through year-end) just as much as growth concerns/haven flows keep duration supported. The front-to-belly is also being strongly supported in face of large Treasury supply this week (USD 113bln across 2s, 5s, and 7s), clearly not something that is dissuading investors. By settlement 10-year yield had fallen 9bps to 1.379%, while the 2-year had fallen 8.5bps, leaving the 2s10s spread at 11.5bps.</p><p><strong>Fed's Mester (Voter, Hawk)</strong> reiterated monetary policy in the US is well calibrated and added there are risks to US outlook including the impact of nCoV but expects US economy to continue to perform well. 2020 outlook is for the expansion to continue with growth around trend, a solid labour market, and low and stable inflation. Mester sees PCE inflation returning to 2% target gradually over the next year or two and does not at this time support cutting rates to spur a faster return to its inflation goal. Mester also noted that it is very difficult to assess the risk to the US economy of the coronavirus.

        "content": "<p>Asian equities trade mixed but with the risk tone somewhat improving compared to yesterday’s global stock rout. US indices closed with sharp losses on Monday over fears regarding the number of growing coronavirus cases outside of China, causing the S&amp;P and Dow to wipe out their YTD gains, with the latter closing lower by over 1000 points. However, US equity futures have experienced a relief rally since the open as the contracts retrace some of their recent losses. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-1.0%) remains subdued, albeit off lows, as mining and banking names still bear the brunt of the prior session’s decline in base metals and yields. Nikkei 225 (-3.0%) opened with losses of ~4.5% as the benchmark caught-up to the recent events after its extended weekend, including a firmer JPY. The Japanese index later clambered off lows amid the abating risk aversion, and with Fujifilm Holdings soaring almost 9% at the open as Japan announced that it is to use its drug as a coronavirus treatment. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+0.9%) stands as the outperformer after the index consolidated from the prior session’s hefty losses before being bolstered by reports of a declining rate of COVID-19 cases in the country, and with no new reported deaths thus far. Further reports stated that South Korea is to draft a supplementary budget as soon as possible, whilst the government also taking containment measures in Daegu and North Gyeongsang provinces to prevent further spreading. Over in China, the Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp (-1.2%) trade mixed, with the former balancing gains in tech and pharma against depleting losses in financials and oil giants. Meanwhile, Mainland lags amid a lack of fresh China stimulus and with the PBoC also skipping open market operations for a sixth consecutive day for a daily net neutral position.</p><p>In FX, DXY trades choppy within a relatively tight range thus far following yesterday’s Yen-led losses, albeit the index remains south of 99.500 and closer to 99.250 in APAC hours. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are uneventful and move in tandem with the Greenback amid a lack of overnight drivers for the currencies, with the former meandering on either side of 1.0850 throughout the bulk of the session, with the pair’s 10 DMA to the downside at 1.0832. Meanwhile, Cable holds onto its 1.2900 handle as it inches closer to its 100 DMA residing around 1.2955. Elsewhere, Antipodeans remain supported by the overall risk sentiment; AUD/USD reclaimed 0.6600 to the upside ahead of mild resistance seen at 0.6620, meanwhile, its Kiwi counterpart attempts to convincingly advance above 0.6350 with resistance touted around 0.6357 (21st and 24th Feb highs). Meanwhile, USD/JPY seems to be tracking gains in US equity futures – with the pair eyeing 111.00 to the upside as Japanese participants returned to the market. Finally, CNH experiences some strength in light of firmer Yuan fixing by the PBoC vs. expectations for a weaker setting.</p>",
