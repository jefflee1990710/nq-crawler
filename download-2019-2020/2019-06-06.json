Draghi added that the discussion on rate cuts was focussing on the deposit rate and suggested the ECB has considerable room, as well as comfort of law for restarting APP facility.

Williams also commented he is not worried by market pricing of rates and said trade worries among investors are likely to be a factor in the cuts priced in. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Kaplan (Non-Voter, Dovish) said it is premature to make a judgement on a Fed rate cut due to trade tensions, but is concerned that risks to the downside have increased, while he added that that yield-curve inversion is significant but needs to see that the inversion has 'some size and duration'. (Newswires)</p><p>There were earlier reports that US is reportedly mulling delaying Mexico tariffs as time for a deal is running short but that tariffs coming into effect on Monday is still possible. However, White House Press Secretary Sanders later said the US is still moving ahead with Mexico tariffs at this point and other reports stated that US President Trump plans to declare a national emergency to impose tariffs on Mexico. (Newswires/The Hill)</p><p>Mexico and the US were earlier reported to be considering outlines of a deal that could boost Mexican immigration enforcement effort and give the US more latitude to deport asylum seekers. In related news, Mexican President AMLO said he will reveal his proposal to the US on Saturday 8th June and Mexican Foreign Minister Ebrard thinks the US and Mexico have made some advances on Thursday in talks, although US Presidential aide Schlapp said Mexico are not offering enough to avert tariffs.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped higher after Morgan Stanley upgraded the firm to equal weight from underweight. PG&amp;E (PCG) reversed early losses, but ultimately finished lower, after pre-market reports that the co. had spoken to lawmakers about putting together a pool of capital worth about USD 11bln in order to settle claims relating to the recent California wildfires. Ciena Corp (CIEN) shot higher after the tech firm reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines. Elastic NV (ESTC) was under pressure, despite the software co. reporting decent headline earnings. Five Below (FIVE) also reported strong headline earnings, but moved lower after the retailer revised down FY revenue guidance. Uber (UBER) was unable to capitalise on reports that the ride hailing co. is to expand its helicopter service, which is to be called Uber Copter and is to commence on 9 July in New York City. J M Smucker Co (SJM) managed to reverse the bulk of heavy losses at the open, after the co. posted earnings that missed on top line expectations, but ultimately finished lower. Fleetcor (FLT) fell after Citron called the co out for alleged “green fraud”. Anthem (ANTM) moved higher, supported by reports that the co. is to buy a behavioural health company. 3M (MMM) spiked higher after the industrial co.’s CFO sees core operations producing Q2 EPS similar to Q1. S&amp;P 500 0.6% AT 2844, Dow Jones 0.8% AT 7276, NASDAQ-100 0.7% AT 25722.</p><p>The TPLEX was takings its cue from EGBs in early trade, and the curve flattened after the ECB extended its forward guidance, pledging to keep rates in negative territory through the summer of 2020. The ECB's TLTRO announcement, however, once the details were digested, saw the short-end of the yield curve rise, since the rate was not as low as analysts were expecting (the consensus expected -0.25%, though the range is -0.30% to +0.10%, midpoint -0.10%; the exact rate banks will get depends on whether they achieve lending targets). Fed rate cut pricing was little changed on Thursday, ahead of Friday's payrolls data, after which the Fed enters blackout; the implied probability of a Fed rate cut at the June meeting is around 20%, July is around 70%, and the market is 98% certain a rate cut will land by year-end. Fed's Williams (voter) touched on market pricing in remarks on Thursday, and he suggested that while it is informative, it does not force the Fed's hand; Williams suggested that it was reflective of uncertainty around trade, and potential recessions on the horizon. Treasuries did sell off going into settlement on the news that the US was mulling the delay of tariffs on Mexico, but the move was respectful of recent ranges. At settlement, major curve spreads had flattened, the 2s/10s contracted c. 4bps, with the 2s/30s most pronounced, where it flattened by c. 5.5bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled 1 tick lower at 126-19+.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong> Equites up, Treasuries down, Dollar down, Crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> ECB pushes back guidance and releases details of TLTROs, US considers delaying Mexico tariffs, BoE’s Carney hints at rate rises, Fed’s Kaplan is worried about Mexico tariffs, US President Trump hints at further China tariffs, Trump aide says Mexico not doing enough but reports the US may delay tariffs</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>JN Household spending, SZ Unemployment rate, GE Industrial Output, Exports, Imports and Trade Balance, US Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate, Average Earnings, CA Employment Change, Unemployment Rate, Average Earnings, US Baker Hughes</p><p><strong>* ECB POLICY MEETING REVIEW:</strong> The latest policy announcement from the ECB saw policymakers stand pat on rates as expected, whilst unexpectedly (according to consensus) pushing back guidance on rates from “rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019\" to \"at least through the first half of 2020\". Furthermore, the Bank unveiled details on the lending terms of TLTRO3 with the “interest rate to be set at 10bps above the average MRO rate over the life of each operation” (i.e. 0% + 10bps), whilst “counterparties exceeding their lending benchmark a lower interest rate will apply a rate which can be as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points” (i.e. -0.4% + 10bps). In response to the announcement, HSBC assessed the modalities of the funding measures as “at the generous end of the spectrum, although not quite as generous as the TLTRO2 (10bps more expensive), with TLTRO3 set to “ensure a continued degree of support to the short-end of the sovereign bond curve”. In terms of the press conference, President Draghi noted that incoming data points to weaker growth in Q2 and Q3, whilst Euro Area risks remain tilted to the downside. Nonetheless, a strong Q1 EZ GDP print was enough to see an upgrade to 2019 GDP in the staff economic projections to 1.2% (Prev. 1.1%) with 2020 and 2021 both lowered to 1.4% from 1.6% and 1.5% respectively. On the inflation front, Draghi stated that headline inflation is likely to decline over coming months, then rise towards the end of the year. With this in mind, staff forecasts upgraded 2019 HICP to 1.3% (Prev. 1.2%), whilst 2020 was lowered to 1.4% (Prev. 1.5%) and 2021 maintained at 1.6%. During the Q&amp;A, Draghi noted that the decisions taken today were unanimous. However, (one of the more dovish aspects of the press conference) the President noted that there was a discussion on the ECB’s readiness to act in the event of an emergency with policymakers raising the possibility of lowering rates (deposit), restarting APP and a further extension of forward guidance. On the subject of forward guidance for rates, Draghi later stated that it is not correct to suggest that guidance is tilted towards rate hikes. Discussions on other measures included the prospect of a tiered rate system, however, the ECB President pushed back against such action, suggesting that the positive impact of negative rates is not undermined by the side effects, albeit the ECB will continue to monitor transmission, and mitigating measures. Overall, ING concludes that the ECB “is now only a fraction away from new stimulus”, adding that “it’s not their preferred option but it will probably only take a small economic slip for the ECB to cut rates”.</p><p><strong>* BOE’S CARNEY:</strong> Governor Carney said if economy continues to perform as MPC expects, upward pressure on prices will build and the BOE will likely have to raise rates further to keep inflation at target. However, any rise will be gradual and limited. These comments are part of the BOE's annual report. The guidance itself is in line with that offered at the May QIR meeting, which uses the phrasing “gradual” and “limited'.</p><p><strong>* US/MEXICO:</strong> Mexican President AMLO said that he will reveal his proposal to the US on Saturday 8th June, referring to the set of demands Mexico is reportedly to make as part of trade talks with the US (as a reminder, these will include funds from US for development, demand that arms cease to criminal cartels and will not accept a \"safe third country status\" that forces asylum claimants to seek refuge in Mexico). Mexican Foreign Minister Ebrard was upbeat about the state of negotiations, which continued on Thursday, commenting that he thinks the two sides made some advances, whilst Canadian PM Trudeau was also optimistic, saying that Mexico had indicated that the threat of US tariffs will not interfere with USMCA ratification. Later news from the US side echoed US President Trump’s earlier comments and was less upbeat, with Trump aide Schlapp saying that Mexico are not offering enough to avert tariffs. Later, reports suggested that the US may delay tariffs on Mexican imports to give more time for negotiations, whilst there were also reports that Mexico would send 7k troops to the Southern border to prevent the passage of immigrants.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>The punchy rhetoric, with a side of nationalism, continued from the Chinese side on Thursday, as China’s Commerce Ministry said the nation will be forced to adopt appropriate countermeasures if US decides to unilaterally escalate trade tensions and added that China will fight to the end in the event the US decides to escalate trade tensions. Early on, US President Trump hinted that tariffs could be raised on another USD 300bln of Chinese imports if necessary but that talks are ongoing, before later commenting that he would probably decide on further China tariffs after this month’s G20 summit.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Ahead of Friday’s payrolls report, <strong>Fed's Kaplan (Non-Voter, Dovish)</strong> expects that job growth will need to moderate given that labour markets are tight. On trade, Kaplan said he dispute with Mexico was a very big deal as trade with the nation involves intermediate goods. Kaplan said it presents downside risks to business confidence and capex, and this could begin impacting hiring, and therefore, affect household spending. He repeated his view that rates were in the region of neutral, and repeated I was too soon to make a judgement on Fed rate cuts due to trade tensions, but is concerned that downside risks have increased. More broadly, Kaplan observed that global growth was decelerating, and that this slowdown will spill-over into US growth. Kaplan said the yield curve inversion was significant, but he needs to see that the inversion has some size and some duration. <strong>Fed’s Williams (Voter)</strong> pushed back against market pricing, saying that market views on Fed rate pricing are informative but do not force the Fed's hand, and that an inverted yield curve does not require a rate cut nor is it an “oracle” for recession. He suggested that trade worries among investors are likely to be a factor in the cuts priced in. He also said that rates are currently at neutral and it is likely that low rates are here to say. Moreover, while he said he had always been vigilant of excessively high inflation, low inflation is the more pressing problem at the moment.</p><p><strong>* NONFARM PAYROLLS PREVIEW</strong>: The Street looks for a headline print of 185k, beneath the six-month trend rate of 207k/month. Wages growth is likely to remain at 3.2% Y/Y. Labour market gauges have been mixed this month, with the ADP measure of payroll growth in stark contrast to the ISM gauges. Some banks have suggested the mixed signals might hint at a turning point in the economic cycle. Data is due for release at 08:30 EDT/13:30 BST, on Friday 7th June 2019.

EU Commissioner Moscovici was constructive, stating that Italy still has the burden of proof on its deficit and debt, and his door remained open for talks. Later, both Di Maio and (the other) Deputy PM Salvini agreed that the government must carry on; both said they wanted constructive dialogue with the EU, arguing that cutting taxes was a priority to relaunch the economy, according to a statement, and added that extraordinary measures are needed.</p><p><strong>* US INTERNATIONAL TRADE:</strong> The US trade deficit narrowed in April *to USD 50.8bln from USD 51.9bln); both exports and imports declined 2.2%, though analysts have suggested that a 47% fall in civilian aircraft exports overstated the weakness in exports. YTD, the trade deficit is +2% Y/Y in April. Oxford Economics says that annual benchmark revisions now imply a 0.2ppts upward revision to Q1 GDP growth on this data. The consultancy also says that in the face of escalating trade tensions, real merchandise export momentum eased for a third month to -2.4% Y/Y from 0.3% Y/Y in March. Imports have also cooled to -0.7% Y/Y from 1.9% Y/Y in March. “With the threat of tariffs looming, leading indicators do not point to a growth rebound,” Oxford economics says.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 1 TICK LOWER AT 126-19+: </strong>The TPLEX was takings its cue from EGBs in early trade, and the curve flattened after the ECB extended its forward guidance, pledging to keep rates in negative territory through the summer of 2020. The ECB's TLTRO announcement, however, once the details were digested, saw the short-end of the yield curve rise, since the rate was not as low as analysts were expecting (the consensus expected -0.25%, though the range is -0.30% to +0.10%, midpoint -0.10%; the exact rate banks will get depends on whether they achieve lending targets). Fed rate cut pricing was little changed on Thursday, ahead of Friday's payrolls data, after which the Fed enters blackout; the implied probability of a Fed rate cut at the June meeting is around 20%, July is around 70%, and the market is 98% certain a rate cut will land by year-end. Fed's Williams (voter) touched on market pricing in remarks on Thursday, and he suggested that while it is informative, it does not force the Fed's hand; Williams suggested that it was reflective of uncertainty around trade, and potential recessions on the horizon. Treasuries did sell off going into settlement on the news that the US was mulling the delay of tariffs on Mexico, but the move was respectful of recent ranges. At settlement, major curve spreads had flattened, the 2s/10s contracted c. 4bps, with the 2s/30s most pronounced, where it flattened by c. 5.5bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.91 HIGHER AT USD 52.59/BBL; BRENT (Q9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.04 HIGHER AT USD 61.67/BBL:</strong> The crude complex had a choppy session on Thursday, before spiking into settlement, as participants digested the bearish inventory data in addition to a slew of comments from Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian President Putin said it has differences over what is a 'fair' oil price, but USD 60-65/bbl “suits us”. Putin added that Saudi would like a higher price, but Russia will make a consolidated decision with OPEC. Analysts at Citi note that their base case for OPEC+ supply cut extensions remains, but caveat that Russian resistance remains a risk. Saudi and Russia officials are scheduled to continue meeting in the coming days to discuss how to converge their energy strategies ahead of the OPEC+ meeting. Although some Russian state officials had expressed openness to extending the cuts, Russian oil major Rosneft again expressed its opposition to the extension of cuts, as well as Gazprom Neft’s CEO who said a new deal should not be rushed, and it prefers stability over really high prices. Energy Minister Novak said later in the session that Russia’s output is likely to recover after June, with production down at the moment due to the contaminated oil and maintenance season (indicating that its current compliance isn’t necessarily voluntary). Meanwhile, Iraqi Oil Minister Al Luaibi said that the 4.64mln BPD OPEC producer (as according to May survey data) supports an extension of the cuts and more serious measures given recent developments; however, Iraq itself is not producing at the current commitment level of 4.51mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.6% AT 2844, DOW JONES 0.8% AT 7276, NASDAQ-100 0.7% AT 25722, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.5%, Consumer Staples 0.8%, Energy 1.7%, Financials 0.4%, Health Care 0.3%, Industrials 0%, Information Technology 1.1%, Materials 1.1%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) move higher after overnight reports suggest the electric automaker have delivered 2.5k cars already in North America this June, whilst also receiving an upgrade at Elazer Advisors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped higher after Morgan Stanley upgraded the firm to equal weight from underweight. PG&amp;E (PCG) reversed early losses, but ultimately finished lower, after pre-market reports that the co. had spoken to lawmakers about putting together a pool of capital worth about USD 11bln in order to settle claims relating to the recent California wildfires. Ciena Corp (CIEN) shot higher after the tech firm reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines. Elastic NV (ESTC) was under pressure, despite the software co. reporting decent headline earnings. Five Below (FIVE) also reported strong headline earnings, but moved lower after the retailer revised down FY revenue guidance. Uber (UBER) was unable to capitalise on reports that the ride hailing co. is to expand its helicopter service, which is to be called Uber Copter and is to commence on 9 July in New York City. J M Smucker Co (SJM) managed to reverse the bulk of heavy losses at the open, after the co. posted earnings that missed on top line expectations, but ultimately finished lower. Fleetcor (FLT) fell after Citron called the co out for alleged “green fraud”. Anthem (ANTM) moved higher, supported by reports that the co. is to buy a behavioural health company. 3M (MMM) spiked higher after the industrial co.’s CFO sees core operations producing Q2 EPS similar to Q1.</p><p><strong>* FX DAILY WRAP: EUR </strong>doves were disappointed as the single currency moved higher after the latest ECB policy meeting, despite rate guidance being unexpectedly pushed back through spring 2020, TLTRO3 details being unveiled and Draghi striking a distinctly dovish tone during the press conference: EURUSD now holding above May’s highs.<strong> USD </strong>was largely a function of EUR on the day, albeit catching modest strength later in the session as Fed’s Williams pushed back against the market’s aggressive pricing of rate cuts. <strong>GBP </strong>caught a bid after BoE’s Carney spoke of the need for more rate hikes should the economy continue to perform as expected. Carney’s comments saw Cable break back above the 1.2700 level, but the move was eroded by mild dollar strength later in the session. <strong>JPY </strong>was again marginally weaker vs. the buck, as stocks made higher ground and sentiment lifted into later in the session on the news that the US could postpone Mexico tariffs: USDJPY now trading at the top of its recent 107.85-108.50 range. On which note, <strong>MXN</strong> traded fairly choppy, but ultimately strengthened, as the aforementioned news saw the peso briefly surge higher. USDMXN reached lows of 19.53 before paring the move somewhat after sources caveated the earlier report by saying tariffs coming into effect is still a possibility. <strong>CAD</strong> advanced on the day, supported by the weaker dollar, the stronger crude complex and a strong Ivey PMI reading. Elsewhere, <strong>ZAR</strong> was weaker, despite efforts by SA’s ANC to play down concerns about SARB independence and promising current account data, with USDZAR now testing 15.00.</p>",

The ECB's TLTRO announcement, however, once the details were digested, saw the short-end of the yield curve rise, since the rate was not as low as analysts were expecting (the consensus expected -0.25%, though the range is -0.30% to +0.10%, midpoint -0.10%; the exact rate banks will get depends on whether they achieve lending targets). Fed rate cut pricing was little changed on Thursday, ahead of Friday's payrolls data, after which the Fed enters blackout; the implied probability of a Fed rate cut at the June meeting is around 20%, July is around 70%, and the market is 98% certain a rate cut will land by year-end. Fed's Williams (voter) touched on market pricing in remarks on Thursday, and he suggested that while it is informative, it does not force the Fed's hand; Williams suggested that it was reflective of uncertainty around trade, and potential recessions on the horizon. Treasuries did sell off going into settlement on the news that the US was mulling the delay of tariffs on Mexico, but the move was respectful of recent ranges. At settlement, major curve spreads had flattened, the 2s/10s contracted c. 4bps, with the 2s/30s most pronounced, where it flattened by c. 5.5bps.</li></ul>",

Russian President Putin said it has differences over what is a 'fair' oil price, but USD 60-65/bbl “suits us”. Putin added that Saudi would like a higher price, but Russia will make a consolidated decision with OPEC. Analysts at Citi note that their base case for OPEC+ supply cut extensions remains, but caveat that Russian resistance remains a risk. Saudi and Russia officials are scheduled to continue meeting in the coming days to discuss how to converge their energy strategies ahead of the OPEC+ meeting. Although some Russian state officials had expressed openness to extending the cuts, Russian oil major Rosneft again expressed its opposition to the extension of cuts, as well as Gazprom Neft’s CEO who said a new deal should not be rushed, and it prefers stability over really high prices. Energy Minister Novak said later in the session that Russia’s output is likely to recover after June, with production down at the moment due to the contaminated oil and maintenance season (indicating that its current compliance isn’t necessarily voluntary). Meanwhile, Iraqi Oil Minister Al Luaibi said that the 4.64mln BPD OPEC producer (as according to May survey data) supports an extension of the cuts and more serious measures given recent developments; however, Iraq itself is not producing at the current commitment level of 4.51mln BPD.</p>",

Over the last three-months, payrolls have averaged 169k/month; over the last six-months, the average is 207k/month; and over the last 12-months, the trend rate is 218k/month. And following April’s above-consensus 263k gain, several factors point to a cool-down in May. Bank of America Merrill Lynch points to the escalation of trade tariffs hurting business sentiment and hiring activity at the margin, and the job cuts from the cyclical slowdown in the auto sector, which it says should be realised in coming months. On the supportive side, BAML notes that consumer sentiment on the labour market continues to improve, and the bank cites the cyclical high in the differential between jobs ‘hard to get’ and jobs ‘plentiful’ in the Conference Board’s gauge of consumer confidence, which it argues implies workers overall feel that labour market conditions remain still in their favour.</p><p><strong>* WAGES:</strong></p><p>Wage growth is expected to remain near cyclical highs at 3.2% YY amid a ramp up of skill shortages, analysts think. ING Argues that the important factor for the Fed is that these skill shortages appear to be translating into upward pressure on wages. It also notes that the April Beige book mentioned that firms are having to entice staff with more non-wage perks, while the most recent Beige Book said most districts saw modest to moderate growth in jobs and wages, though some regions (San Fran and Richmond) cited difficulties in finding workers, or they highlighted tight labour market conditions. Overall, the latest Beige Book indicated wage pressures were \"relatively subdued\". ING’s estimate for average hourly earnings growth is in line with consensus, and if confirmed, “suggests markets may still be underestimating potential core inflationary pressures.”</p><p><strong>* CLAIMS DATA:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the nonfarm payrolls survey period, initial jobless claims printed 212k, falling from 228k and snapping a run of three consecutive higher readings; analysts commented that claims were reverting to the trend rate. Nomura suggests a tight labour market with solid underlying near term strength, attributing it to May’s jobless claims, as well as the Conference Board’s labour market differential, which tends to track the unemployment, rate relatively well, remained in healthy territory during May.</p><p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS:</strong></p><p>ADP National Employment Data came in at just 27k, well below the expected 180k and last month’s 271k (revised lower from 275k), the lowest print since September 2010. Pantheon Macroeconomics comments that “payroll growth was bound to slow in May, following April’s unexpected strength, but this is a much bigger slowdown than we expected.” ADP’s model incorporates both macro variables and employment data collected from the firms who use its payroll service, Pantheon notes, so the fact that the May number was substantially lower than Pantheon’s estimate, which is based solely on macro variables, implies that the information ADP collected from its clients was very soft. “ADP’s model is not always reliable, but this is such a big miss that we have to temper our forecast for Friday’s official number” the consultancy says, “we now expect a 100K increase.” Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs noted the starkly different signals offered from the ISM and ADP numbers for Friday’s official payroll report: “Given a potentially large drag from financial variables and economic inputs in the ADP model this month, we place substantially more weight on the ISM measure”, the bank said.</p><p><strong>* ISM SURVEYS:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The manufacturing ISM employment sub-component rose 1.3 points to 53.7 in May, remaining above 50 for the 32nd straight month. “Employment continued to expand, and at marginally higher levels compared to April but the index recorded the single biggest gain of the five PMI subindices,” ISM’s Fiore said, “comments received include hiring of recent college graduates, increases in temporary labour to support seasonality, and in some cases, deferring hiring due to economic uncertainty.” ISM points out that an employment index above 50.8, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the BLS data on manufacturing employment. The non-manufacturing ISM employment sub-index rose 4.4 points to 58.1, remaining above50 for the 63rd consecutive month. Comments from respondents included: “Filling open positions” and “we added a few more employees to fill outstanding needs.”</p><p><strong>* CHALLENGER JOB CUTS:</strong></p><p>Job cuts rose to 58k in May, +46% M/M and +86% Y/Y. So far this year, US employers have cut 289k jobs, 39% higher versus the same period in 2018. “The Tech sector announced the highest number of jobs cuts last month,” Challenger said, “large tech firms are finding they need to move workers through the pipeline in order to become more agile” and it adds that it has in fact seen “a number of tech and telecom companies offering buyouts to older workers over the last year.” The tech sector cut nearly 12.5k jobs in May, bringing the YTD total to 18.5k, 342% higher than the 4k announced over the same period last year, the data showed. Industrial manufacturing and automotive companies are also announcing an increasing number of job cuts. Challenger said this is significant, as these industries are likely to be most hurt by the potential trade war with Mexico. Industrial companies have announced 44k job cuts YTD, 671% higher than the 6k job cuts announced through May 2018, while the automotive industry has cut 21.5k jobs, 211% higher than the 6,905 cuts in the same period last year.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The eagerly awaited ECB meeting did not disappoint in terms of its billing as Thursday’s headline act and biggest potential market moving event. However, those of an extremely dovish bent were seemingly underwhelmed or upset given price moves following the latest delay in hike timing (now at least through mid-2020 from end of this year) and a sliding/conditional scale for TLTRO3 loans. Eur/Usd has pulled back from 1.1300+ highs again, but remains firmer than pre-policy action levels circa 1.1270 vs 1.1240 and an initial knee-jerk 1.1216 low even though President Draghi turned increasingly, if not decidedly dovish during the course of the press conference and Q&amp;A in particular. To recap, he reiterated downside growth risks and that the Bank remains ready to use all tools if needed, while also revealing that some members mentioned rate cuts and even restarting QE. Draghi also insisted that there is room for further stimulus, conventional and unconventional.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Euro’s rebound sapped a lot of the Dollar’s recovery momentum, but the Greenback is now weaker across the board and the <strong>DXY</strong> has relinquished 97.000+ status yet again as a result. The index is now holding just above a fresh session low within a 96.780-97.344 range with scant reaction to mixed US data or latest remarks from Fed’s Kaplan who still does not seem inclined to back any easing, but did note that slower global growth will impact the domestic economy.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/NZD/JPY/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>As noted above, all taking their lead from the single currency or simply benefiting from the latest Buck retreat as the Franc retests bids/support at 0.9900 and Cable revisits 1.2700+ highs. Meanwhile, the non-US Dollars are also back near best levels seen of late, with the Kiwi eyeing 0.6950, Aussie edging closer to 0.7000 and Loonie looking at bids said to be sitting between 1.3370-60 again, with some encouragement from a smaller than forecast Canadian trade gap and stronger NSA Ivey PMI. Elsewhere, the Yen did not stray from 108.00-50 parameters vs the Usd, at a stretch, with option expiries curtailing trade as no less than 7.3 bn rolling off in between.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In contrast to the G10 trend, regional currencies retreated against the Greenback with Usd/Zar touching 15.0000 despite efforts by SA’s ANC to play down concerns about SARB independence, while Usd/Try rebounded towards 5.8050 on some short covering and a technical correction and Usd/Mxn rallied in wake of negative ratings agency action and not enough progress on day 1 of negotiations between Mexico and the US.</p>",

Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (U/C</strong>) remained afloat as Australia continued to ride the wave of the lower rate environment and amid broad gains across the sectors aside from mining names, while the Japanese benchmark was also higher but with gains capped amid an indecisive currency, as well as weakness in automakers including Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors after Fiat abruptly withdrew its merger proposal for Renault. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%)</strong> were mixed ahead of their extended weekend with initial weakness seen as Chinese press continued to point the blame on the US for the breakdown of negotiations and with Chinese agencies said to be collecting opinions on further countermeasures against the US. However, some of the losses were later pared after the PBoC announced CNY 500bln in 1-year MLFs and reiterated to keep liquidity in the banking system ample. Finally, 10yr JGBs pulled back to below the 153.50 level amid mild gains in Japanese stocks and as yields recovered from multi-year lows, while the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs also showed slightly weaker demand.</p><p><strong>PBoC </strong>injected CNY 10bln via 7-day reverse repos and <strong>announced a CNY 500bln 1-year MLF operation</strong>. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8945 (Prev. 6.8903)</strong></p><p><strong>US lawmakers reportedly offered legislation which would increase oversight on some Chinese companies</strong>. Elsewhere, there were also <strong>reports the US Defence Department held talks with Mkango Resources and other rare earth projects about supplies of critical minerals,</strong> while it is said to be working on connecting rare earth development projects with financiers. (Newswires)</p><p>Chinese Commerce Ministry says the nation will be forced to adopt appropriate countermeasures if US decides to unilaterally escalate trade tensions, and that China will fight to the end in the scenario that the US decides to escalate trade tensions. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p><strong>US President Trump says tariffs on China could be raised to another USD 300bln if necessary in trade disputes</strong>, talks are ongoing. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US and Mexico officials failed to reach a deal on tariffs and immigration at Wednesday meeting. Furthermore, US President Trump stated progress is being made in talks with Mexico \"but not nearly enough\"</strong>, while he added that talks will resume on Thursday and that 5% tariffs will begin on Monday if no deal is reached. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Mexico Foreign Minister Ebrard said they did not discuss tariffs during meeting on Wednesday</strong> and will seek common ground in Thursday’s talks. (Newswires)</p><p>Reports noted that US talking points going into the tariff meetings were said included asylum cooperation, stopping trafficking networks, border enforcement and maintaining or increasing immigration detentions, while Mexico reportedly would make its own demands in talks with the US in which they will seek funds from US for development, demand that arms cease to criminal cartels and will not accept a \"safe third country status\" that forces asylum claimants to seek refuge in Mexico. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK Trade Minister Fox said a trade deal is possible soon after Brexit although the ratification process will take some time. (Newswires)</p><p>EU's Moscovici says Italy still has the burden of proof on its deficit and debt, and his door remains open for talks.

Sectors are mostly higher, although European Telecom names underperform with the likes of Vodafone (-3.0%) weighing on the sector as they are ex-dividend. Notable movers include Renault (-7.3%) after Fiat Chrysler (Unch) withdrew its merger offer after the French state, Renault’s largest shareholder, requested discussions be put off to a later date; albeit the French Budget Minister did note that future merger talks between the company may happen. The news of the break-up in talks saw most European autos open lower, although Renault competitor Peugeot (+2.0%) spiked to the top of the CAC. Elsewhere, the FTSE reshuffle is due to take place on June 24th, with confirmation that easyJet (+0.5%) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (Unch) will be demoted, whilst JD sports (-0.4%) and Aveva (+1.1%) will be added to the blue-chip index. Furthermore, in Italy, the FTSE MIB will see Nexi (+1.1%) replace Banca Generali (+0.1%).</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY -</strong> The Dollar is off recovery highs, but the index is consolidating above the 97.000 axis after rebounding from sub-96.500 at one stage on Wednesday when Fed rate cut fever rose on the back of dovish leaning speeches from Brainard and Evans (latter changing tune somewhat from the previous day), hot on the heels of a dismal ADP survey (albeit partly corrective perhaps). Subsequent comments from Kaplan advocating the current wait-and-see policy and a solid looking services ISM helped the Greenback regain composure and the latest Beige Book also maintained a relatively upbeat tone. Hence, the DXY is holding within a 97.344-198 range ahead of more potentially pivotal US data and Fed commentary.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD/EUR -</strong> Usd/Jpy looks pretty tethered to the 108.00 level after another rally on improved risk sentiment and a resultant rebound in US Treasury yields fizzled out ahead of 108.50. However, the headline pair may now be hostage to option-related flows given a mass of mega expiries ranging from 108.00 to 109.00 and totalling 10.5 bn. Meanwhile, the Antipodean Dollars are both firmer vs their US counterpart, albeit not breaking fresh ground after recent RBA and RBNZ policy actions and guidance, with Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd meandering between 0.6983-64 and 0.6633-18 respective parameters. Note, little net reaction to Aussie trade data overnight as a sub-forecast surplus was partly compensated by an encouraging rebound in exports. Elsewhere, the single currency is also fairly contained vs the Buck and generally eyeing the upcoming ECB policy meeting and press conference to see how dovish or not President Draghi is and anticipating details of TLTRO3 – see our Research Suite for a full preview. Eur/Usd is currently hovering around 1.1230 and also close to decent option expiry interest lying at 1.1220-30 in 2 bn and 1.1200-10 in 1.5 bn.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK -</strong> The Scandi Crowns have both bounced off worst levels to retest technical and psychological resistance vs the Euro around 9.7850 and 10.6000 respectively, with the former propped by an uptick in Norway’s 2019 mainland GDP forecast from the Stats office which also sees the Norges Bank hiking this month in line with official guidance.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/CHF -</strong> All relatively flat vs the Usd, but the Loonie could derive some independent impetus from Canadian trade later and deviate from 1.3400-30 bounds, while Cable hovers just below 1.2700 and the Franc near 0.9950.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Mxn has conceded more ground than most to the semi-Usd revival as high hopes of a Mexican-US deal were dashed yesterday, and even though talks are set to continue today the Peso suffered a double ratings whammy as Fitch downgraded the sovereign to BBB from BBB+ and Moody’s revised the outlook to credit negative from stable. Usd/Mxn now midway between 19.5720-8345.</p><p>Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(Apr) 4871mln vs. Exp. 5100mln (Prev. 4949mln, Rev. 4887mln).

Bunds have now been up to 171.46 (and -24 bp in the corresponding cash yield) and Gilts as high as 130.33, while US Treasuries are hovering just under overnight session peaks, albeit lagging behind and a little detached from EU equivalents awaiting US data and more Fed rhetoric ahead of tomorrow’s NFP release. Back to Eurex, Italian debt has pared gains in the run up to the ECB amidst more reports from Rome suggesting that the Government will not scale back fiscal plans to appease the EU, or at least not to the extend that Brussels wants. 10 year BTPs currently just shy of 130.00 vs 130.49 at best and a new recent low at 129.81.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI (+0.1%) and Brent (+0.5%) futures are higher on the day, but with gains capped as the benchmarks hold onto most of yesterday’s supply-sparked losses following the barrage of bearish numbers including record high US production and a mammoth surprise build in stockpiles. </strong>WTI tested resistance around the USD 52.00/bbl broke the level in a short-lived move, whilst its Brent counterpart briefly breached the USD 61.00/bbl to the upside. In terms of implications ahead of the OPEC gathering, concerns about the rise in US inventories were flagged by oil producers at the JMMC meeting, and this was reinforced by OPEC and allies yesterday in which OPEC Secretary General Barkindo noted that they will take the current “economic bearishness” into account when they meet in the coming weeks.&nbsp; In terms of the meeting date, Russian Energy Minister Novak noted that he is discussing postponing the OPEC+ gathering to July 2nd/4th, ahead of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart on June 10th. Elsewhere, gold (+0.5%) extends on recent gains and remains near three-month highs as trade tensions show no signs of abating as US-Mexico talks failed to conclude with an agreement; albeit dialogue is expected to resume today. Meanwhile, copper declined to a two-year low amid the bleak demand outlook whilst Dalian iron ore futures were pressured by anticipation of increased supply.</p><p><strong>US refiners warned the Trump administration that tariffs on imports from Mexico could severely impact refiners and raise gasoline prices</strong> just as the US driving season kicks into high gear. (Newswires)</p><p>Former US Energy Secretary Moniz said there is sufficient capacity to compensate for a supply disruption in the order of 1mln bpd.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities are higher across the board [Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%]</strong> as sentiment somewhat diverges from the mixed handover in Asia ahead of the ECB monetary policy decision. Sectors are mostly higher, although European Telecom names underperform with the likes of Vodafone (-3.0%) weighing on the sector as they are ex-dividend. Notable movers include Renault (-7.3%) after Fiat Chrysler (Unch) withdrew its merger offer after the French state, Renault’s largest shareholder, requested discussions be put off to a later date; albeit the French Budget Minister did note that future merger talks between the company may happen. The news of the break-up in talks saw most European autos open lower, although Renault competitor Peugeot (+2.0%) spiked to the top of the CAC. Elsewhere, the FTSE reshuffle is due to take place on June 24th, with confirmation that easyJet (+0.5%) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (Unch) will be demoted, whilst JD sports (-0.4%) and Aveva (+1.1%) will be added to the blue-chip index. Furthermore, in Italy, the FTSE MIB will see Nexi (+1.1%) replace Banca Generali (+0.1%).</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The Dollar is off recovery highs, but the index is consolidating above the 97.000 axis after rebounding from sub-96.500 at one stage on Wednesday when Fed rate cut fever rose on the back of dovish leaning speeches from Brainard and Evans (latter changing tune somewhat from the previous day), hot on the heels of a dismal ADP survey (albeit partly corrective perhaps). Subsequent comments from Kaplan advocating the current wait-and-see policy and a solid looking services ISM helped the Greenback regain composure and the latest Beige Book also maintained a relatively upbeat tone. Hence, the DXY is holding within a 97.344-198 range ahead of more potentially pivotal US data and Fed commentary.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD/EUR</strong> - Usd/Jpy looks pretty tethered to the 108.00 level after another rally on improved risk sentiment and a resultant rebound in US Treasury yields fizzled out ahead of 108.50. However, the headline pair may now be hostage to option-related flows given a mass of mega expiries ranging from 108.00 to 109.00 and totalling 10.5 bn. Meanwhile, the Antipodean Dollars are both firmer vs their US counterpart, albeit not breaking fresh ground after recent RBA and RBNZ policy actions and guidance, with Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd meandering between 0.6983-64 and 0.6633-18 respective parameters. Note, little net reaction to Aussie trade data overnight as a sub-forecast surplus was partly compensated by an encouraging rebound in exports. Elsewhere, the single currency is also fairly contained vs the Buck and generally eyeing the upcoming ECB policy meeting and press conference to see how dovish or not President Draghi is and anticipating details of TLTRO3 – see our Research Suite for a full preview. Eur/Usd is currently hovering around 1.1230 and also close to decent option expiry interest lying at 1.1220-30 in 2 bn and 1.1200-10 in 1.5 bn.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong> - The Scandi Crowns have both bounced off worst levels to retest technical and psychological resistance vs the Euro around 9.7850 and 10.6000 respectively, with the former propped by an uptick in Norway’s 2019 mainland GDP forecast from the Stats office which also sees the Norges Bank hiking this month in line with official guidance.</p><p>CAD/GBP/CHF - All relatively flat vs the Usd, but the Loonie could derive some independent impetus from Canadian trade later and deviate from 1.3400-30 bounds, while Cable hovers just below 1.2700 and the Franc near 0.9950.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Mxn has conceded more ground than most to the semi-Usd revival as high hopes of a Mexican-US deal were dashed yesterday, and even though talks are set to continue today the Peso suffered a double ratings whammy as Fitch downgraded the sovereign to BBB from BBB+ and Moody’s revised the outlook to credit negative from stable. Usd/Mxn now midway between 19.5720-8345.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s virtually relentless or almost self-fulfilling as the rally in core debt continues with only brief pauses for breath and periods of consolidation. <strong>Bunds</strong> have now been up to 171.46 (and -24 bp in the corresponding cash yield) and Gilts as high as 130.33, while US Treasuries are hovering just under overnight session peaks, albeit lagging behind and a little detached from EU equivalents awaiting US data and more Fed rhetoric ahead of tomorrow’s NFP release. Back to Eurex, <strong>Italian</strong> <strong>debt</strong> has pared gains in the run up to the ECB amidst more reports from Rome suggesting that the Government will not scale back fiscal plans to appease the EU, or at least not to the extend that Brussels wants. 10 year BTPs currently just shy of 130.00 vs 130.49 at best and a new recent low at 129.81.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> (+0.1%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (+0.5%) futures are higher on the day, but with gains capped as the benchmarks hold onto most of yesterday’s supply-sparked losses following the barrage of bearish numbers including record high US production and a mammoth surprise build in stockpiles. WTI tested resistance around the USD 52.00/bbl broke the level in a short-lived move, whilst its Brent counterpart briefly breached the USD 61.00/bbl to the upside. In terms of implications ahead of the OPEC gathering, concerns about the rise in US inventories were flagged by oil producers at the JMMC meeting, and this was reinforced by OPEC and allies yesterday in which OPEC Secretary General Barkindo noted that they will take the current “economic bearishness” into account when they meet in the coming weeks.&nbsp; In terms of the meeting date, Russian Energy Minister Novak noted that he is discussing postponing the OPEC+ gathering to July 2nd/4th, ahead of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart on June 10th. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> (+0.5%) extends on recent gains and remains near three-month highs as trade tensions show no signs of abating as US-Mexico talks failed to conclude with an agreement; albeit dialogue is expected to resume today. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> declined to a two-year low amid the bleak demand outlook whilst <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> ore futures were pressured by anticipation of increased supply.</p>",

Consequently, the equivalent cash yield is edging closer towards the next psychological marker (-0.25%), which would roughly coincide with resistance in futures above 171.43 and ahead of 171.97. Interestingly, the latest rally has come alongside BTP advances beyond 130.00 and amidst broad gains ahead of the ECB. Note however, Spanish and French debt could encounter some auction-related hedging or concession for hefty multi-tranche issuance, but final Q1 jobs and GDP releases are unlikely to impact unless revised markedly.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;will conclude its 3-day policy meeting on Thursday in which the central bank is expected to lower rates with 66% of economists surveyed forecasting the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate to be cut by 25bps each to 5.75% and 5.50% respectively, while the Cash Reserve Ratio is expected to be kept at 4.00%. Another survey showed 80% anticipate the central bank to maintain its neutral stance although analysts are more evenly divided going forward with half of respondents anticipating the central bank to remain on pause for the rest of the year after this meeting.</p><p>Consensus for the RBI to lower rates for a 3rd consecutive occasion in as many meetings under the stewardship of Governor Das is mainly due to the data, as India lost its status as the world’s fastest growing major economy with GDP for the March quarter at 5.8 % vs. Exp. 6.3% (Prev. 6.6%), which was the slowest pace of expansion in 17 quarters. Meanwhile, the latest CPI figures showed headline inflation remained comfortably below the RBI’s 4% target at 2.92% vs. Exp. 2.97% (Prev. 2.86%), which suggests there is plenty of &nbsp;room available for looser policy to support the economy.</p><p>The minutes from the prior meeting also hinted at the MPC being open to further policy loosening as Governor Das commented there is a need to consider rate adjustments, not necessarily in the conventional way of 25bps or multiples thereof and that the RBI will monitor momentum on inflation as well as other variables before deciding on further rate cuts. This has led to some speculation the RBI may even be willing to do more as State Bank of India recently suggested that a larger cut of more than 25bps would be needed in the upcoming decision to reverse the current economic slowdown, while Kotak Mahindra Bank sees the potential for fresh liquidity measures as well as a cut. In addition, the recent election victory by PM Modi and the BJP which further strengthened its majority in the Lower House is likely to result to a continuation of government pressure on the central bank to spur the economy.</p><p>However, it is also worth noting that as the voting composition at the last meeting remained at 4-2 in favour of a cut with Deputy Governor Acharya and external member Ghate the dissenters, it would only need a shift by Governor Das for a pause to occur due to his casting vote. Some also suggest the RBI may want to wait and see how the monsoon progresses given the impact it could have on food prices and overall inflation, as well as allow the prior back-to-back rate cuts to take full effect.</p><p>The announcement is scheduled for 0715BST/0115CDT/1415HKT in which focus will also be on whether the&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;maintains a neutral stance and the composition of votes. As a reminder, the reaction to&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;policy announcements can sometimes be unconventional as looser policy has supported the currency instead of weakening it in some prior occasions, which is due to the suspected inflows of funds on the back of more favourable policies.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region cautious after hopes of an agreement to avert Trump tariffs on Mexico have so far failed to materialize, although officials will continue discussions on Thursday. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) have remained afloat as Australia continues to ride the wave of the lower rate environment and amid broad gains across the sectors aside from mining names, while the Japanese benchmark is also higher but with gains capped amid a choppy currency as well as weakness in automakers including Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors after Fiat abruptly withdrew its merger proposal for Renault. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) trade indecisive with initial weakness seen as Chinese press continues to point the blame on US for the breakdown of negotiations and with Chinese agencies said to be collecting opinions on further countermeasures against the US. However, some of the losses were later pared after the PBoC announced CNY 500bln in 1-year MLFs and reiterated to keep liquidity in the banking system ample.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat near the prior day’s highs above the 97.00 level after stronger than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI data inspired a turnaround during US hours, and as Fed’s Kaplan pushed back on rate cut bets in which he suggested a preference for patience and that it is too early to make judgments on rates. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD and GBP/USD despondent after their recent failure to hold onto the 1.1300 and 1.2700 handles respectively, while price action in USD/JPY is contained by the indecisive risk tone and large option expiries totalling USD 7.1bln for today’s New York cut circa 108.00-108.50. Elsewhere antipodeans are lacklustre following mixed Aussie trade data and with ANZ Bank calling for 2 more cuts this year in August and November, although the biggest mover overnight was MXN which weakened after rating agency downgrades in which Moody’s revised Mexico’s outlook to negative from stable and Fitch cut its rating by one notch to BBB. Losses were then exacerbated after officials failed to reach a deal on tariffs and immigration.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower and have pulled back to below the 153.50 level amid mild gains in Japanese stocks and as yields recover from multi-year lows, while focus for the complex shifts to the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs later.</p>",
