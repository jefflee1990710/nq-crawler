The more constructive risk sentiment was built on after the G7 summit, where there were a few 'deals' announced, and a level of unity that was not seen at last year's meeting in Canada. Equities traded firmer, and ignored 2s10s meandering in and out of inversion -- something which would have led to more distinct equity downside just last week, some desks have also cited. Crude was largely following overall risk sentiment (equities), though saw some downside on positive geopolitical developments regarding Iran (President Macron has tried to broker a meeting between Presidents Rouhani and Trump, the latter of which seemed amenable to meeting, and even to the prospect of making a deal). Treasuries, meanwhile were lower, with 10-year yields recovering Friday's slide, though SPX has not risen back to Friday's highs. Some desks last week were writing that global macro funds were on the side lines dip-buying, on the rationale that US economic fundamentals are still sound. Gold also continues to trade in positive territory, in a sign that not all risk assets have bought into Monday's risk on. The Trump-inspired trade optimism has fed through to the trade sensitive stocks, which lead gains on Monday, including Apple (AAPL), industrials (UTX, BA, DE) and chipmakers (INTC, NVDA, AMD, MU). Bristol-Myers (BMY) and Celgene (CELG) outperformed after agreeing to divest Celgene’s Otezla drug to Amgen (AMGN) post completion of their pending merger; Amgen opened lower on the news. PDC Energy (PDCE) surged as it announced the acquisition of competitor SRC Energy (SRC). Vici Properties and Dish Networks (DISH) benefitted from upgrades at Morgan Stanley and Raymond James respectively. Beyond Meat (BYND) surged on a KFC (YUM) collaboration. TechnipFMC (FTI) caught a bid on announcing it would separate into two separately public traded companies. S&amp;P 500 +1.1% at 2879, NASDAQ-100 +1.5% at 7575, Dow Jones +1.1% at 25902.</p><p>Treasuries were in negative territory, largely on optimism regarding a medley of factors, although it is notable that yields, while largely recovering the downside seen on Friday, have not matched the optimism of equity markets, which were trading up by over a percent at one point. It has taken yields longer to rise (at the time equities were up around 1%, yields were only up by around 1bps across the curve; however, at pixel time, equities are off the highs by a margin, and yields are up around 3bps at the short end, and around 2bps at the long-end. Curve spreads are relative flat (+/- 1bps for the major spreads, at settlement); 2s10s once again entered inversion in the European afternoon, although it did not have a detrimental impact on the risk environment. Some traders are more interested by this week’s bund auctions, rather than Treasury auctions. The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (Tue, USD 40bln), new 5-year note (Wed, USD 41bln) and new 7-year note (Thu, USD 32bln). Analysts at UBS say this week will bring USD 85bln of cash (excluding SOMA holdings) but including around USD 76bln of redemption, as well as around USD 8.5bln of coupons. US T-note futures (U9) settled 5+ ticks lower at 130-25.</p>",

The more constructive risk sentiment was built on after the G7 summit, where there were a few 'deals' announced, and a level of unity that was not seen at last year's meeting in Canada. Equities traded firmer, and ignored 2s10s meandering in and out of inversion -- something which would have led to more distinct equity downside just last week, some desks have also cited. Crude was largely following overall risk sentiment (equities), though saw some downside on positive geopolitical developments regarding Iran (President Macron has tried to broker a meeting between Presidents Rouhani and Trump, the latter of which seemed amenable to meeting, and even to the prospect of making a deal). Treasuries, meanwhile were lower, with 10-year yields recovering Friday's slide, though SPX has not risen back to Friday's highs. Some desks last week were writing that global macro funds were on the side lines dip-buying, on the rationale that US economic fundamentals are still sound. Gold also continues to trade in positive territory, in a sign that not all risk assets have bought into Monday's risk on.</p><p><strong>* G7:</strong> Comments out of the G7 somewhat surprisingly set markets up for a risk-on day; heading into the week, the perception was that the G7 may only stoke further downside risks in wake of trade escalation between the US and China at the end of last week. However, we have seen US/Japan reaching an 'in principle' trade deal, to be signed in September; Trump also said he thought a deal can be made with the EU on trade, without imposing auto tariffs; there seems to have been progress on the 'digital tax' from the US perspective. Trump also appeared to imply he was flexible on China tariffs, saying it was possible for their imposition to be delayed; some also cited the 'positive' remarks from China Vice Premier Liu He (calling for 'calm'). Additionally, the G7 statement alluded to many of the factors that Trump is pushing for (some were not even expecting a statement, so the fact we got one is a positive): the statement backed WTO reform in order to safeguard intellectual property (one of Trump's gripes with China), the group commits to 'free and open' trade (a common Trump mantra), and the group reaffirmed the 1984 Sino/US agreement on Hong Kong - none of the discord that characterised the 2018 G7 meeting was explicitly evident.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong>&nbsp;After the most recent escalations of the trade conflict, China Vice Premier Liu He called for calm; US President Trump has claimed that China called US trade negotiators on Sunday night, and wants to return to the negotiation table - a claim dismissed by the ubiquitous Global Times Editor, who is often seen as a proxy for the official China government position; Trump rejected this denial, reiterating that talks were taking place at the highest level. Trump also added that China President Xi was a great leader, and said the US will make a further statement on China. Trump was asked if he could delay planned tariffs on China, to which the President replied that anything was possible, and he added that US was now in a much better position now than at any time in trade negotiations; this led to an injection of 'risk-on' trade in the markets, and set the tone for the day's trade. Meanwhile, many desks have been revising down growth forecasts in China, and have warned that it may even lead to a lower growth profile in the US too. At the concluding G7 press conference, Trump said he wants a deal with China only if it was a good deal and a fair deal for the US, then repeated a familiar remark, saying he thinks he will make a deal with China.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS:</strong>&nbsp;Durable Goods: Durable goods came in at 2.1%, up from the prior 1.8% (Revised lower by 10bps) and beating expectations for 1.2%, due to a rebound in Boeing (BA) orders. Initially seeming like a strong report, however core readings were mixed. Ex-Transport durable goods declined 0.4%, falling from the prior 0.8% gain. The Ex Defense measure slowed to a 1.4% gain from a prior 3.1% and non-defense ex-air beat expectations for a 0.1% decline but slowed from the prior 0.9% to 0.4%. Pantheon Macroeconomics note the core figures do remain sluggish; the non-defense ex air measure did rise to 0.4%, however it was the first time since October 2016 that it dipped below the prior year’s level. The Y/Y fall was 0.5%, however, Pantheon state for now, the underlying trend seems more flatter than lower. Overall, the current orders are soft rather than terrible, but the desk notes a deterioration appears more likely than more of the same across the remainder of H2 as the NFIB survey clearly shows a sustained downward shift in capital spending over the next few months. In terms of GDP, IFI note that the poor core shipments, -0.7% M/M, shows trade uncertainty is taking its toll and weighing on this element of GDP.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong>&nbsp;Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif attended the G7 summit over the weekend for side-line meetings with French President Macron in efforts to ease US-Iran tensions. Trump said he was aware in advance that Macron had invited Zarif, and in his comments dialled down some of the usual harsh stance on Iran, although he did say it was too soon for the US to meet with the Iranians but there would be talks going forward on the issue of Iran’s ballistic missile programme. G7 host Macron was also upbeat, saying that he hopes for a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Rouhani, adding that conditions have been set for a meeting and a deal could result from one. An Iranian government spokesperson has since said that Tehran has no interests with the US regarding dialogue, and rejected Macron’s proposals for negotiations over its ballistic missile programme; also that Iran had sold the oil from the formerly seized Grace 1 tanker (now called Adrian Darya). Elsewhere, Zarif said he is now in Beijing to brief China on the discussions in France about the 2015 nuclear deal; this comes ahead of the September 5th deadline Iran has given the Europeans to make good on their commitments before Iran further scales back its commitments.</p><p><strong>* JAPAN/US:</strong> Both nations have reached an in-principle trade agreement, that will see Japan make more purchases of US agricultural goods, while duties on beef and pork will also be cut, although US tariffs on Japanese autos will remain (although, in comments, Trump said he was not looking at auto-tariffs for Japan currently). Elsewhere, Japanese PM Abe says the government has put in place the sufficient steps to support consumption for the tax hike in October.</p><p><strong>* DIGITAL TAX:</strong> US President Trump said France and the US were close to reaching a compromise on the proposed digital tax. The solution proposes that France repay to companies the difference between a French tax and a planned mechanism being drawn up by the OECD, Reuters reported, citing sources which stated that Trump advisors are said to be pleased with the proposal. The French measure involves a 3% levy on revenue from digital services earned by firms with more than EUR 25mln of French revenues, and EUR 750mln global revenues, which the US has said unfairly targets US names like Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK PM Johnson on Sunday said that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will no longer be legally obliged to pay the GBP 39bln divorce bill agreed by former UK PM May. Johnson reportedly told EU's Tusk at the G7 that the UK would pay less than GBP 10bln in a no deal scenario, with UK outlets suggesting it could be between GBP 7-9bln. EU Brexit coordinator Verhofstadt on Monday said that if the UK does not pay what is due, then the EU will not negotiate a trade deal. Johnson has also sought legal advice on proroguing parliament for five weeks in order to prevent lawmakers from scheming to extend Article 50. Elsewhere, at the G7, Johnson reiterated his position on the backstop (must be jettisoned), ; some reports had suggested that if a \"real\" solution to the Irish backstop can be found, reopening negotiations on the withdrawal agreement would not be a problem, according to an Express journalist, citing sources. On a US/UK trade deal, President Trump dismissed the notion that any deal would \"do over\" the UK, while Johnson said he did not want a quick deal that was not maximising opportunities for the UK.</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> The Bund/BTP spread has narrowed from around 240bps at the open to under 200bps, as it appears that the 5SM and PD are close to agreeing Conte to be PM, while other risk-friendly headlines were also supportive.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY IFO:</strong> The main three metrics were weaker, dashing the scant hopes for a rebound in Q3. ING's analysts said the free fall of the German economy continues. \"IFO index marks another low-point and can be described with one simple word: 'horrible'. Within one year, the German economy has made a complete turnaround, unfortunately not for the better but for the worse.\" It is worth noting that the significance of the data has been somewhat diminished since it does not include the impact of the latest trade escalations.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLES 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-25. </strong>While Treasuries are in negative territory, largely on optimism regarding a medley of factors, it is notable that yields, while largely recovering the downside seen on Friday, have not matched the optimism of equity markets, which were trading up by over a percent at one point. It has taken yields longer to rise (at the time equities were up around 1%, yields were only up by around 1bps across the curve; however, at pixel time, equities are off the highs by a margin, and yields are up around 3bps at the short end, and around 2bps at the long-end. Curve spreads are relative flat (+/- 1bps for the major spreads, at settlement); 2s10s once again entered inversion in the European afternoon, although it did not have a detrimental impact on the risk environment. Some traders are more interested by this week’s bund auctions, rather than Treasury auctions. The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (Tue, USD 40bln), new 5-year note (Wed, USD 41bln) and new 7-year note (Thu, USD 32bln). Analysts at UBS say this week will bring USD 85bln of cash (excluding SOMA holdings) but including around USD 76bln of redemption, as well as around USD 8.5bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (V9) SETTLE USD AT USD /BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD AT USD:</strong>&nbsp;The energy markets settled lower but have been tracking risk appetite on Monday, where the benchmarks rose to their peaks before the US equity open and then reversed course throughout the session. Participants have been digesting the G7 summit and the latest US-China trade developments, with mixed signals from Beijing and Washington on the current state of play, with Trump spurring optimism whilst comments from China have been on a more cautious tone. However, comments from French President Macron that he hopes for a US President Trump and Iranian President Rouhani summit provided some selling pressure to crude markets. Latest energy expectations…</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Amid a more constructive environment for risk, JPY’s is the standout. Overnight, USDJPY found lows around 104.50, but has retained the 106.00 handle heading into Asia trade, after optimistic remarks out of the G7 summit gives hope that US and China may once again be making progress on trade (if you buy it, of course), which saw equities up and Treasury yields higher. However, evidence of risk on is not universal: EMFX, for instance is still lagging, as the DXY trades higher by around half-a-percent, while gold retains a bid. Perhaps EMFX is lower, perhaps due to the yuan, where the offshore hit highs around 7.18. Another sign, questioning the sustainability of this risk rally, are the Antipodes, which trade mixed, although the risk-friendly CAD trades slightly positive against the USD. GBP’s gains also reversed amid the overnight risk off, and has failed to make any headway against either the USD or the EUR, despite the latter trading lower against the buck (also of note, EUR strength was lacking amid higher USDCNY – EUR trade weighted basket gives the yuan the largest weighting).</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>Monday's USDCNY fix was broadly in line with expectations (7.0528 vs 7.0572 on Friday), but the currency pair still rose higher in cash markets, printing highs slightly below 7.15. The PBOC also injected CNY 150bln via MLF, rolling over the 149bln that matured at the end of last week. The fix could be a sign that the central bank is trying to calm markets, and not contribute to market jitters. However, analysts are expecting that the escalation of the US/China trade conflict will result in the PBOC guiding is USD/CNY fix higher this week, which in turn will likely apply upward pressure on USD/Asia crosses. UBS notes that EM Asia is still one of the largest foreign credits, and EM FX positions for real money investors, and recommend further hedging since the uncertainty is becoming a dominant theme.</p><p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Sight deposits held by Swiss commercial banks rose by CHF 3.8bln last week, the largest weekly rise since March 2017, taking the total to a record CHF 589.3bln. Desks note, however, that this still pales in comparison to the spikes of January 2015 (SNB abandoned the EUR/CHF floor of 1.20), as well as in June/July 2016 (post-Brexit vote). SocGen's analysts note that, with the ECB set to cut its deposit rate and restart QE, perhaps at the September meeting, it will force the SNB to cut rates deeper into negative territory, and futures are pricing in a c. 80% chance of a 25bps cut next month. From a technical perspective, SocGen recommends keeping an eye on key support at 1.0825 and then 1.0620.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 +1.1% at 2879, NASDAQ-100 +1.5% at 7575, Dow Jones +1.1% at 25902; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary +1%, Consumer Staples +1.1%, Energy +0.5%, Financials +1.1%, Health Care +1%, Industrials +0.8%, Information Technology +1.4%, Materials +0.3%, Telecommunication Services +1.5%, Utilities +1.2%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong>&nbsp;The Trump-inspired trade optimism has fed through to the trade sensitive stocks, which lead gains on Monday, including Apple (AAPL), industrials (UTX, BA, DE) and chipmakers (INTC, NVDA, AMD, MU). Bristol-Myers (BMY) and Celgene (CELG) outperformed after agreeing to divest Celgene’s Otezla drug to Amgen (AMGN) post completion of their pending merger; Amgen opened lower on the news. PDC Energy (PDCE) surged as it announced the acquisition of competitor SRC Energy (SRC). Vici Properties and Dish Networks (DISH) benefitted from upgrades at Morgan Stanley and Raymond James respectively. Beyond Meat (BYND) surged on a KFC (YUM) collaboration. TechnipFMC (FTI) caught a bid on announcing it would separate into two separately public traded companies.</p>",

Participants have been digesting the G7 summit and the latest US-China trade developments, with mixed signals from Beijing and Washington on the current state of play, with Trump spurring optimism whilst comments from China have been on a more cautious tone. However, comments from French President Macron, who is attempting to broker a meeting between US President Trump and Iran President Rouhani – a meeting Trump seems amenable to, with some conditions – provided downside for the crude complex; however, Iran seems to have rejected the notion thus far. In terms of this week’s inventories, analysts are expecting to see crude stocks draw by 2.1mln, distillate build by 0.8mln, and gasoline is expected to draw by 1.0mln.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Nowhere near as dramatic, but the Yen was hit by a stop-chase like the Lira overnight when Usd/Jpy broke 105.96 and prevailing intraday peaks through 106.00 to a fresh 106.40 top amidst TV headlines on a business channel tagged as breaking, but old, and research from an asset manager on social media suggesting that the worst may be over in terms of US-China trade wars. However, the headline pair has subsequently drifted all the way back towards the big figure as Chinese officials and journalists continue to play down US President Trump’s claims that high level trade negotiators from Beijing called their US counterparts to re-open dialogue after Friday’s escalation in tariffs from both sides. Moreover, some Chinese observers questioned Trump’s take on a seemingly constructive comment from China’s VP Lui He about the country’s willingness to resolve the spat via ‘calm’ negotiations and whether this was a sign of Beijing backing down. Nevertheless, the Yen remains well off best levels seen at the height of post-Friday risk aversion when it ramped up to 104.50+.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Also some distance from best levels vs the Usd after the weekend G7 failed to build on Brexit momentum that was riding high after face-to-face meetings between UK PM Johnson and German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron. Cable hit a peak of 1.2285 before fading and slipping back to circa 1.2210 as Johnson conceded that it is still touch and go in terms of reaching a deal with the EU before October 31, while Eur/Gbp mis back above 0.9100 from around 0.9065 at one stage.</p><p><strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc and Gold both unwound a degree of their safe-haven premium, but remain underpinned within 0.9810-0.9715 and 1525-55/oz ranges respectively even though Swiss sight deposits rose again to validate speculation that the SNB has been intervening to curb Chf strength/demand.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Euro had negative fundamentals to deal with on top of a firmer Greenback, with the NZ trade balance swinging from surplus to shortfall overnight and Germany’s Ifo survey weakening further and the institute rather downbeat in accompanying comments as stagnation in Q3 is deemed to be the best that can be anticipated. Nzd/Usd retreated from 0.6395 to sub-0.6350 before consolidating and Eur/Usd pulled back a bit further from 1.1165 to under 1.1110, while Usd/Cad straddled 1.3300 with the Loonie not deriving much direction from choppy oil prices or some knee-jerks in wake of mixed US durable goods data. Note, the <strong>DXY</strong> did creep over 98.000, but only just awaiting more post-G7 rhetoric from Trump and other leaders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>In contrast to the overall trend, the Aussie forged gains vs its US counterpart, albeit partly due to Aud/Nzd cross winds as that pair rebounded from around 1.0530 to 1.0610 or so, with Aud/Usd holding near the upper end of a 0.6773-0.6690 band. Trump’s reports about the state of play on trade with China were a prop, but the Aussie also continued benefit from the RBA’s more balanced outlook and policy stance.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Try suffered very heavy losses in keeping with a flash crash when Japanese margin accounts reportedly liquidated unprofitable long Try/Yen positions overnight. However, the Turkish Lira is back up near 5.8000 compared to almost 6.3000 during Asian trade, but Usd/Cnh remains relatively bid above 7.1600 irrespective of more conciliatory remarks from Trump who is not ruling out another roll-back of Chinese tariffs, and reports of big Chinese banks selling Dollars vs the Yuan.</p>",

        "subject": "(UPDATE) ANALYSIS: TRUMP UPS THE ANTE ON CHINA",
        "content": "<p><strong>RECAP:</strong> Late-doors last Friday, US President Trump announced a 5ppts increase to the current and impending tariffs on China. This would see the levy on USD 250bln worth of Chinese goods raised to 30% (Prev. 25%) and the looming tax on USD 300bln (starting September 1st) at 15% (Prev. 10%). Meanwhile, US President Trump also insisted that he has the absolute right to order US companies out of China under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but added we'll see how it goes. The US President tweeted his announcement hours after China announced retaliatory tariffs on US goods in relation to the upcoming (at the time 10%) levies on the USD 300bln worth of goods. As a reminder, China will tax around USD 75bln US goods at a rate of 5-10%, effective September 1st and December 15th (the same days US tariffs kick-in). Crude oil is among the products to be tariffed at 5% from September 1st, whilst additional auto tariffs of 25% will be reimposed. In terms of agricultural goods, US soybean will see a tax of 5% effective September 1st, US wheat, corn and sorghum at 10% starting December 15th, whilst US beef and pork will also see a tax of 10%.</p><p><strong>THE LATEST: </strong>Early constructive comments from US President Trump, in which he said he has great respect for President Xi, that China reached out to US negotiators over the weekend and stated that China is ready to come back to the negotiating table and the two countries will start talking very seriously, saw a marked improvement in risk sentiment. Moreover, when asked if he could delay planned tariffs on China, Trump said anything is possible, and added that we are in a much better position now than at any time in trade negotiations. Trump said that an announcement on China will be made later, although its timing and content remain unclear. Rhetoric from the Chinese side has been less constructive (with comments, headlines and tweets from China Global Times editor Hu Xijin weighing on sentiment). In sum; the Chinese Foreign Ministry said they resolutely oppose the US's new tariffs and China will take further steps to protect their interests if the US enacts new tariffs. Moreover, they added that they are not aware of any weekend phone calls between the two nations. Punchy comments from China Global Times editor Hu Xijin later added credence to these comments; he said top Chinese and US negotiators had not held talks in the past few days, but the two sides have been keeping contact at a technical level, before adding China has not changed position and the country will not cave to US pressure. When asked about the Chinese denial of such phone calls, US President Trump doubled down on his earlier claim, saying talks were taking place “at the highest level”. China President Xi later said that China will look to step payments from the central government to important and disadvantaged agricultural producing areas - Agricultural exports has been a key Trump demand, and as such, analysts may see this move by China as a veiled message to the US, amid the most recent trade war escalation.</p><p>Should the trade war continue to escalate, what weapons could each nation employ?</p><p><strong>1) CHINA’S ARSENAL:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tariff Increase: </strong>The current levies announced could increase further to match the effect of US’ tax imposition on the outstanding goods, albeit the size likely to remain the same as the US imports far more goods from China than vice versa.</li><li><strong>An unreliable entity list: </strong>This list could exclude some US firms from doing business with Chinese companies.</li><li><strong>Rare-earth restrictions: </strong>Another “weapon” in China’s arsenal. Prohibiting these rare earth exports to the US will significantly impact hi-tech/electronic producers which may be forced to slow or even halt some US production.

The PBoC previously stated that it will not partake in a competitive devaluation of the Yuan, although the currency move prompted the US to label China as a 'currency manipulator'.

        "content": "<p><strong>*US/EU:</strong></p><p>French and US Finance Officials agreed on a draft proposal on France's digital tax, which will be submitted to heads of state later on Monday, reported sources close to negotiations. US President Trump later alluded to such progress, saying the US and France are getting close to a compromise on the digital issue. Reportedly, the solution proposes that France repay to companies the difference between a French tax and a planned mechanism being drawn up by the OECD, Reuters reported, citing sources which stated that Trump advisors are said to be pleased with the proposal. For reference, the French digital services tax involves a 3% levy on revenue from digital services earned by firms with more than EUR 25mln of French revenues, and EUR 750mln global revenues. The tax has been a point of contention between the US and France/EU; the US saying it unfairly targets US names like Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).&nbsp;</p><p>Seperately, US President Trump said that the US and Germany have reached agreements on a lot of things including trade, adding that he hopes he does not have to consider tariffs on German autos (comments which saw upside in German autonames. Trump also suggested that a trade deal more broadly was discussed with the EU, on which topic, German Chancellor Merkel said that the EU wants to have deeper trade talks with US and a reach a deal soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Although developments seemed largely positive on the US/EU trade front, Trump did have some choice words for the EU, saying the EU is as tough as China on trade and that US has lost lots of money to the EU over the years.</p><p><strong>*BREXIT:</strong></p><p>While PM Johnson's meetings with German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron prior to the weekend's Summit were designed to prevent Brexit from dominating events, it inevitably cropped up.</p><p>Notably, Johnson said that the prospect of a Brexit deal is improving, but the situation remains ‘touch and go’. Discussions between Johnson and European Council President Tusk did not achieve a significant breakthrough; with European officials reiterating the line that it is now up to Britain to find an alternative to the Irish Backstop. Meanwhile, US President Trump commented that Johnson is the correct man to deliver Brexit and a trade deal with Britain could be secured in around one year, although Johnson did play this time-frame down somewhat.</p><p>Separately, PM Johnson commented that in the event of a no-deal Britain would not be liable for the GBP 39bln divorce bill.</p><p>Overall, the weekend's comments on balance do not alter the lay of land very much. Arguably, a more positive line can be taken from Johnson’s comments that the prospect of a Brexit deal is improving; however, his subsequent caveat and the fact that talks with EU’s Tusk did not produce a breakthrough temper any potential positivity.</p><p><strong>*IRAN:</strong></p><p>Unexpectedly, Iranian Foreign minister Zarif attended side-line discussions. Consensus appears to be that the US as well as other participants were surprised by the attendance of Zarif. Although, reports indicate that Macron did ask/inform US President Trump of Zarif’s attendance the prior day. Subsequently, US President Trump declined to comment on whether American officials met the foreign minister and that it was too soon for a meeting with Zarif.</p><p>It is unclear if the brief meeting between Macron and Zarif yielded any significant progress as Trump has since declined to comment on whether oil sanctions would be waived to have Iran return to the negotiating table; though they are going to discuss ballistic missiles and the duration of any subsequent agreement with Iran.</p><p>As a reminder, the nations' relationship has significantly deteriorated since the US withdrew from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and Iran began increasing its nuclear activity (typically reported via the proportion of enriched uranium, with the latest figures indicating an excess of 300kg) due to economic sanctions being reimposed.</p><p><strong>*BRAZIL:</strong></p><p>While the economic implications of this are somewhat overlooked by, among other things, the ongoing US-China trade war, French President Macron has called upon global leaders to assist Brazil in fighting the Amazon wildfires. With some reports indicating that PM Bolsonaro and Environment Minister Salles’ policies have encouraged the fires through policies they have undertaken since attaining office.</p><p>In terms of implications, most notably EU Council President Tusk stated that while the EU stands by the EU-Mercosur trade agreement (free trade deal between the EU and South American Nations) it is hard to envisage a ‘harmonious process of ratification’ so long as the Brazilian government allows the forest to be destroyed. Specifically, France and Ireland have threatened to block the agreement if Brazilian president Bolsonaro does not act to slow the deforestation rate.</p><p>For context, the EU-Mercosur deal was agreed to in principal earlier in the year, following on from around 20 years of negotiations. Countries involved include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The deal would indicatively eliminate 93% of export tariffs to the EU, with the remainder under a ‘preferential treatment’ arrangement, while 91% of export tariffs to Mercosur countries would be removed.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*THE LATEST: </strong>Talks between PD and 5SM, who entered into discussions last week for the formation of a new government, have hit a sticking point; 5SM want former PM Conte to continue as PM of the new coalition but PD do not. PD Leader Zingaretti wants the new government to mark a “change” from the policies of the former 5SM-Lega coalition and, for this reason, opposes the reappointment of the old PM. However, talks between the two parties have seen some progress; PD accepted 5-Star's request to reduce the number of MPs (provided that there are constitutional guarantees), PD’s Senate Leader said there will be no vetos on Conte as PM, comments which saw strength in BTPs and PD lawmaker said that discussions with the 5SM were positive, provided good reason for hope and presented no insurmountable obstacles.</p><p><strong>*NEXT STEP: </strong>President Sergio Mattarella has given the M5S and the PD untill Wednesday evening to form an agreement, otherwise, he is likely to call early elections for October 27, say Italian media. Mattarella's deadline had originally been for Tuesday, so it appears to have been moved back one day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*ELECTIONS: </strong>League Leader Salvini said he will not resign and will remain as Interior Minister, while he will ask President Mattarella for early elections and stated there is no plan B besides an early vote. The timing of an election is subject to the Parliamentary reform which aims for a reduction in MPs, which HSBC says would mean elections could not take place for another five to six months at least, due to the need to allow a possible referendum to be called, and to re-draw the electoral boundaries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*LATEST POLLING: </strong>Comparing the 2018 general election results to current polls: League currently leads polls at 37% (it currently has 17.4% of the seats in the Lower House), PD follows in the polls with 23% (vs current 18.8%) and 5SM with 18% (vs current 32.7%). In terms of the smaller parties, Brothers of Italy poll at 7% (vs 4.4% in Parliament) and Forza Italia is polling at 6% (vs. current 14%)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Even though China’s Foreign Ministry is unaware of any such calls, the markets are waiting for a statement from Trump with risk aversion receding in the run up. Hence, Usd/Jpy, Usd/Chf and Xau/Usd are extending their retracement to circa 106.00, 0.9785 and 1525/oz from just shy of 104.50, 0.9710 and 1555 respectively at one stage, to the benefit of the <strong>DXY</strong> that is rebounding towards 98.000 vs 97.618 at the low.</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All on the defensive as the Greenback broadly recovers as noted above, but with Sterling also losing more of its Brexit positivity after UK PM Johnson cautioned that while prospects of reaching a deal have improved it remains a close call. Cable is back down around 1.2235 compared to 1.2285 at best, which coincided with a Fib retracement and resistance level ahead of 1.2300 as well, while Nzd/Usd remains toppy on approaches to 0.6400 and is still underperforming vs the <strong>AUD </strong>as the cross rebounds to 1.0600 and Aussie derives more traction from the latest Trump tweets within a 0.6765-0.6690 range. Note also, the Kiwi was not helped by NZ trade data showing a deficit as imports eclipsed exports in July. Elsewhere, the Euro is slipping back towards 1.1100 from 1.1165 with additional pressure, albeit incremental, coming via a dire German Ifo survey and the institute clarifying that the declines in business sentiment, current conditions and expectations did not take into account latest trade war escalations, though this is hardly surprising given the timing of the August poll. Last but not least, the Loonie is still pivoting 1.3300 and not gleaning any independent impetus from Canadian data, but US durable goods may impact as the series of often erratic.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some calm after the overnight risk-off storm, and especially for the Turkish Lira that suffered losses in keeping with a flash crash when Japanese margin accounts are said to have liquidated unprofitable long Try/Yen positions. Usd/Try is back down near 5.8200 compared to almost 6.3000 during Asian trade, but Usd/Cny remains relatively bid above 7.1500 irrespective of more conciliatory remarks from Trump who is not ruling out another roll-back of Chinese tariffs, and reports of big Chinese banks selling Dollars vs the Yuan.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>LONG STORY SHORT: </strong>US President Trump, late-doors on Friday announced a 5ppts increase to the current and impending tariffs on China. This would see the levy on USD 250bln worth of Chinese goods raised to 30% (Prev. 25%) and the looming tax on USD 300bln (starting September 1st) at 15% (Prev. 10%). Meanwhile, US President Trump also insisted that he has the absolute right to order US companies out of China under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but added we'll see how it goes.</p><p><strong>REAR VIEW:</strong> &nbsp;The US President tweeted his announcement hours after China announced retaliatory tariffs on US goods in relation to the upcoming (at the time 10%) levies on the USD 300bln worth of goods. As a reminder, China will tax around USD 75bln US goods at a rate of 5-10%, effective September 1st and December 15th (the same days US tariffs kick-in). Crude oil is among the products to be tariffed at 5% from September 1st, whilst additional auto tariffs of 25% will be reimposed. In terms of agricultural goods, US soybean will see a tax of 5% effective September 1st, US wheat, corn and sorghum at 10% starting December 15th, whilst US beef and pork will also see a tax of 10%.</p><p><strong>CHINA RHETORIC:</strong> Over the weekend, China Global Times’ Chief Editor tweeted that China is seriously preparing for a scenario in which China-US trade relations further deteriorate. He also suggested that if US and China decouple, China can independently develop technology, but the US can't find an alternative market with China's potential, while he added that China will meet short-term difficulties without the US and that the US will lose its driving force of long-term growth without China. However, Vice Premier Lui He took a more conciliatory tone, stating that China is willing to resolve the trade dispute with the US through calm negotiations and resolutely opposes the escalation of trade wars, which is not beneficial for either side. Meanwhile, at its daily presser, China’s Foreign Ministry stated that China resolutely opposes the new tariffs and China will take further steps to protect its interests if the US enacts new tariffs.</p><p><strong>US RHETORIC</strong>: At a G7 presser, US President Trump adopted a somewhat optimistic tone, as he noted that he has great respect for President Xi and that China reached out to US negotiators over the weekend, stating that China is ready to come back to the negotiating table and the two countries will start talking very seriously. US President Trump also said that an announcement on China will be made later. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng stated that he is not aware of any weekend phone calls between the two nations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*BREXIT:</strong></p><ul><li>While PM Johnson's meetings with German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron prior to the weekend's Summit were designed to prevent Brexit from dominating events, it inevitably cropped up.</li><li>Notably, Johnson said that the prospect of a Brexit deal is improving, but the situation remains ‘touch and go’. Discussions between Johnson and European Council President Tusk did not achieve a significant breakthrough; with European officials reiterating the line that it is now up to Britain to find an alternative to the Irish Backstop. Meanwhile, US President Trump commented that Johnson is the correct man to deliver Brexit and a trade deal with Britain could be secured in around one year, although Johnson did play this time-frame down somewhat.</li><li>Separately, PM Johnson commented that in the event of a no-deal Britain would not be liable for the GBP 39bln divorce bill.</li><li>Overall, the weekend's comments on balance do not alter the lay of land very much. Arguably, a more positive line can be taken from Johnson’s comments that the prospect of a Brexit deal is improving; however, his subsequent caveat and the fact that talks with EU’s Tusk did not produce a breakthrough temper any potential positivity.</li></ul><p><strong>*IRAN:</strong></p><ul><li>Unexpectedly, Iranian Foreign minister Zarif attended side-line discussions. Consensus appears to be that the US as well as other participants were surprised by the attendance of Zarif. Although, reports indicate that Macron did ask/inform US President Trump of Zarif’s attendance the prior day. Subsequently, US President Trump declined to comment on whether American officials met the foreign minister and that it was too soon for a meeting with Zarif.</li><li>It is unclear if the brief meeting between Macron and Zarif yielded any significant progress as Trump has since declined to comment on whether oil sanctions would be waived to have Iran return to the negotiating table; though they are going to discuss ballistic missiles and the duration of any subsequent agreement with Iran.</li><li>As a reminder, the nations' relationship has significantly deteriorated since the US withdrew from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and Iran began increasing its nuclear activity (typically reported via the proportion of enriched uranium, with the latest figures indicating an excess of 300kg) due to economic sanctions being reimposed.</li></ul><p><strong>*BRAZIL</strong></p><ul><li>While the economic implications of this are somewhat overlooked by, among other things, the ongoing US-China trade war, French President Macron has called upon global leaders to assist Brazil in fighting the Amazon wildfires. With some reports indicating that PM Bolsonaro and Environment Minister Salles’ policies have encouraged the fires through policies they have undertaken since attaining office.</li><li>In terms of implications, most notably EU Council President Tusk stated that while the EU stands by the EU-Mercosur trade agreement (free trade deal between the EU and South American Nations) it is hard to envisage a ‘harmonious process of ratification’ so long as the Brazilian government allows the forest to be destroyed. Specifically, France and Ireland have threatened to block the agreement if Brazilian president Bolsonaro does not act to slow the deforestation rate.</li><li>For context, the EU-Mercosur deal was agreed to in principal earlier in the year, following on from around 20 years of negotiations. Countries involved include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The deal would indicatively eliminate 93% of export tariffs to the EU, with the remainder under a ‘preferential treatment’ arrangement, while 91% of export tariffs to Mercosur countries would be removed.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: TRUMP UPPED THE ANTE ON CHINA",
        "content": "<p><strong>LONG STORY SHORT: </strong>US President Trump, late-doors on Friday announced a 5ppts increase to the current and impending tariffs on China. This would see the levy on USD 250bln worth of Chinese goods raised to 30% (Prev. 25%) and the looming tax on USD 300bln (starting September 1st) at 15% (Prev. 10%). Meanwhile, US President Trump also insisted that he has the absolute right to order US companies out of China under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but added we'll see how it goes.</p><p><strong>REAR VIEW:</strong> &nbsp;The US President tweeted his announcement hours after China announced retaliatory tariffs on US goods in relation to the upcoming (at the time 10%) levies on the USD 300bln worth of goods. As a reminder, China will tax around USD 75bln US goods at a rate of 5-10%, effective September 1st and December 15th (the same days US tariffs kick-in). Crude oil is among the products to be tariffed at 5% from September 1st, whilst additional auto tariffs of 25% will be reimposed. In terms of agricultural goods, US soybean will see a tax of 5% effective September 1st, US wheat, corn and sorghum at 10% starting December 15th, whilst US beef and pork will also see a tax of 10%.</p><p><strong>CHINA RHETORIC:</strong> Over the weekend, China Global Times’ Chief Editor tweeted that China is seriously preparing for a scenario in which China-US trade relations further deteriorate. He also suggested that if US and China decouple, China can independently develop technology, but the US can't find an alternative market with China's potential, while he added that China will meet short-term difficulties without the US and that the US will lose its driving force of long-term growth without China. However, Vice Premier Lui He took a more conciliatory tone, stating that China is willing to resolve the trade dispute with the US through calm negotiations and resolutely opposes the escalation of trade wars, which is not beneficial for either side. Meanwhile, at its daily presser, China’s Foreign Ministry stated that China resolutely opposes the new tariffs and China will take further steps to protect its interests if the US enacts new tariffs.</p><p><strong>US RHETORIC</strong>: At a G7 presser, US President Trump adopted a somewhat optimistic tone, as he noted that he has great respect for President Xi and that China reached out to US negotiators over the weekend, stating that China is ready to come back to the negotiating table and the two countries will start talking very seriously. US President Trump also said that an announcement on China will be made later. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng stated that he is not aware of any weekend phone calls between the two nations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1) CHINA’S ARSENAL:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tariff Increase: </strong>The current levies announced could increase further to match the effect of US’ tax imposition on the outstanding goods, albeit the size likely to remain the same as the US imports far more goods from China than vice versa.</li><li><strong>An unreliable entity list:</strong> This list could exclude some US firms from doing business with Chinese companies.</li><li><strong>Rare-earth restrictions:</strong> Another “weapon” in China’s arsenal. Prohibiting these rare earth exports to the US will significantly impact hi-tech/electronic producers which may be forced to slow or even halt some US production. SCMP reported earlier this month that China’s rare earth producers are ready to weaponise their supply control and pass any tariffs off via costs to US customers.</li><li><strong>Yuan</strong>: USD/CNH remains above the 7.10 level amid the overall US-China trade landscape. The PBoC previously stated that it will not partake in a competitive devaluation of the Yuan, although the currency move prompted the US to label China as a 'currency manipulator'. Despite this, the daily USD/CNY fixing has been creeping higher, whilst PBoC officials recently reiterated that the Yuan is at an appropriate level at present.</li></ul><p><strong>2) TRUMP’S POTENTIAL TIT-FOR-TAT RESPONSE:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tariff Roll-in:</strong> The US President could walk back on the tariff delay (i.e. some goods to be taxed on December 15th) which would mean 15% on the full batch of USD 300bln on September 1st. Although this seems to be unlikely as Trump preferably would want to keep goods prices down heading into the Christmas shopping season.</li><li><strong>Tariff Ramp up</strong>: An increase of levvies is nothing new. President Trump has threatened this a few times with the latest announcement made late-doors on Friday.</li><li><strong>Currency War:</strong> Another highly touted move, Trump has constantly criticised the Fed and its policy actions as the reason for a firmer Greenback, whilst also accusing China and Europe of manipulating their currencies. Many desks highlight that Trump could use the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stability Fund to weaken the USD vs. the CNY.</li></ul>",

Carney also stated the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has increased but it is not a given and that ability of monetary policy to smooth the impact from a no-deal Brexit would be constrained by the limits to MPC tolerance of above target inflation, <strong>while his view is that easing monetary policy would be more appropriate than not in the case of a no-deal Brexit.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK PM Johnson at the G7 Summit said the prospect of a Brexit deal is ‘improving’ but that the situation still remains ‘touch and go’, adding that Britain would not be obliged to pay the GBP 39bln divorce bill in the event of a no-deal.</strong> However, UK Government lawyers have reportedly drawn up a range of scenarios for no-deal; including one where Britain is legally obliged to pay the GBP 39bln.

As such, the greenback’s transatlantic counterparts seemed content to rest on their laurels as<strong> EUR/USD </strong>traded flat around the 1.1150 level where there is a notable option expiry for today’s New York cut, and with a pullback in <strong>GBP/USD</strong> from resistance near the 1.2300 handle amid UK closure for bank holiday and with PM Johnson somewhat pessimistic on achieving a Brexit deal in 30 days. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> initially extended on Friday’s retreat due to safe-haven flows but then gradually recovered and was helped by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s attempt to diffuse the situation.

The mounting macro pessimism saw a clean march higher in the T-Note throughout the US session, where the short-end made its own headways, with the 2s10s flirting with inversion in the later session, exacerbating risk-off flows. At settlement, the curve was modestly inverted (2s10s -0.3bps), where the whole curve had seen yields fall between 8bps to 9bps and T-notes finished electronic trade higher by 19 ticks at 130.28+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Clarida (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said global outlook has worsened since July meeting but the US economy is in a good place right now and that the Fed will act as appropriate to keep the economy in place.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Mester (Non-voter, Hawk)</strong> said she is undecided for September FOMC meeting but added that the Fed may need to cut rates to avoid restraining the economy if the economic outlook deteriorates, while she also stated that Chinese counter tariffs are just a continuation of the trade uncertainty that has been with us for some time and reiterated that the Fed should be data dependent.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets tracked last Friday’s hefty losses on Wall Street and the continued weakness in US index futures at the reopen due to the escalation in the US-China trade war. This was after both sides fired fresh tit-for-tat tariffs in which China announced 5%-10% tariffs on USD 75bln of US goods and US President Trump later responded with a 5% increase to current and impending tariffs on Chinese goods. ASX 200 (-1.4%) was led lower by underperformance in energy after the recent slump in oil and as the tech sector suffered the brunt of the latest trade aggressions, although gold miners bucked the trend after the precious metal surged on a safe-haven bid. Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) was heavily pressured with losses for exporters exacerbated by detrimental currency flows, while Hang Seng (-2.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) slumped amid the trade concerns as aside from the tariffs, US President Trump also ‘ordered’ American companies to look for an alternative to China which he suggested he had the right to under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, although this would require a national emergency to be declared. Furthermore, Hong Kong was the worst performer amid further unrest as police were said to have beaten protesters and fired tear gas at an anti-surveillance rally over the weekend. Conversely, some of the losses were later pared after China’s Vice Premier Liu He stated that China is willing to resolve the dispute through calm negotiation and resolutely opposes escalation of the trade war, while India markets were intially underpinned after the Finance Minister recently announced several measures to support the economy including a withdrawal of capital gains tax enhanced surcharge and a INR 700bln bank recapitalization but then gradually deteriorated alongside the broad risk averse tone. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned by a safe-haven bid and which coincided with upside in USTs as the US 10yr yield drop to a fresh 3-year low, with the BoJ also present in the market for 10yr+ and inflation indexed bonds.&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia stocks slump after US and China fired fresh tit-for-tat tariffs ",
        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are negative across the board following last Friday’s hefty losses on Wall Street and continued weakness of US index futures at the reopen due to the escalation in the US-China trade war. This was after both sides fired fresh tit-for-tat tariffs in which China announced 5%-10% tariffs on USD 75bln of US goods and US President Trump later responded with an increase of tariffs to 30% from current 25% on USD 250bln of Chinese goods, as well as a hike to 15% from 10% for the impending tariffs on the remaining USD 300bln of Chinese goods. ASX 200 (-1.4%) is led lower by underperformance in energy after the recent slump in oil and with the tech sector suffering the brunt of the latest trade aggressions, although gold miners buck the trend as the precious metal gets a safe haven bid. Nikkei 225 (-2.0%) is heavily pressured with losses for exporters exacerbated by detrimental currency flows, while Hang Seng (-3.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) slumped amid the trade concerns as aside from the tariffs, US President Trump also ‘ordered’ American companies to look for an alternative to China which he suggested he had the right to under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, although this would require a national emergency to be declared. Furthermore, Hong Kong is the worst performer with its benchmark index dragged lower by tech and property names, as well as reports of further unrest as police were said to have beaten protesters and fired tear gas at an anti-surveillance rally over the weekend, although some of the losses were later pared after China’s Vice Premier Liu He stated that China is willing to resolve the dispute through calm negotiation and resolutely opposes escalation of the trade war.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY steadied and gets some respite from the recent slump in which prices nose-dived through the 98.00 level due to the trade war escalation and with President Trump renewing his Fed criticism after the lack of fireworks at Fed Chair Powell’s eagerly awaited Jackson Hole speech. As such, the greenback’s transatlantic counterparts seem content to rest on their laurels as EUR/USD trades flat around the 1.1150 level where there is a notable option expiry for today’s New York cut, and with GBP/USD pulling back from resistance near the 1.2300 handle with the UK away for bank holiday and with PM Johnson somewhat pessimistic on achieving a Brexit deal in 30 days. USD/JPY initially extended on Friday’s retreat due to safe-haven flows but then gradually recovered which was also helped after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He attempted to diffuse the situation. Elsewhere, antipodeans intially suffered due to their China exposure but have since recovered the majority of losses, while TRY was also volatile overnight in which a flash crash saw the currency weaken by around 15% in a matter of seconds before recouping nearly all the losses shortly after.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they get a safe-haven bid and which coincides with upside in USTs which saw the US 10yr yield drop to a fresh 3-year low, while the BoJ were also present in the market for 10yr+ and inflation indexed bonds.&nbsp;</p>",
