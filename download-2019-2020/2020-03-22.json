        "content": "<p>Goldman Sachs said that given the amount of policy support announced each day - asset purchases, income replacement schemes and fiscal stimulus plans - a temporary bounce could happen at any time. For markets to recover, GS says they will need to be able to put limits on the current tail risks, and for new tail risks not to surface. GS identifies six conditions:</p><p><strong>1) A stabilisation or flattening out of the infection rate curve in the US and Europe: </strong>GS notes that Chinese equities in February managed to rebound even without clear signs of an end to economic damage, so US stocks may respond to signs that containment measures are beginning to work. At this time, however, infection rates are still rising rapidly in large parts of the US and Europe, and there are some renewed infections in parts of Asia.</p><p><strong>2) Visibility on the depth and duration of disruptions on the economy, which are currently unknown: </strong>GS emphasises that duration is critical: the difference between a 2-month and a 6-month period of disruptions is highly material. GS sees the peak disruption to activity occurring in April, though notes uncertainties.</p><p><strong>3) Sufficiently large global stimulus: </strong>Market troughs are characterised by both a stabilisation in data but also a strong policy response that finally gets ahead of the deterioration in the data, GS says, and the current policy response is also beginning to become more urgent and more broad-based. But the bank believes central banks have scope to boost support, while fiscal responses are assuming a relatively short period of disruptions to the economy; GS says that authorities have made moves in the right direction, but more may yet be needed.</p><p><strong>4) A mitigation of funding and liquidity stresses: </strong>Funding stresses and liquidity problems have also taken centre stage, adding to the economic risks, and GS believes central banks will need to&nbsp; expand their role as \"purchaser of last resort\" to avoid many fixed income markets remaining dislocated.</p><p><strong>5) Deep undervaluation across major assets and position reduction: </strong>if valuations come close/overshoot worst case scenarios, risk-reward may be appealing even with high uncertainty, GS says. GS sees significant cheapening across assets over the past couple of weeks and says pockets of deep value may now be emerging, though we are not at overshooting levels yet. It notes that in EMFX, the median currency is now through ‘moderate’ levels of undervaluation, but estimates further depreciation to reach GFC-type 'severe' undervaluation. EUR sovereign spreads are not yet in overshooting territory, and neither are equities. The bank says valuations are rarely a sufficient condition for markets to recover, but an unusually large risk premium would allow investors greater comfort in terms of stepping back in if other conditions are fulfilled.</p><p><strong>6) No intensification of other tail risks: </strong>GS says that the longer this crisis lasts, the higher the probability that other tails risks intensify further. Risks that it is watching include: a further dollar spike; even lower oil prices; politics and its spillovers into sovereign spreads and funding (migration crisis in Europe, Brexit, worsening in US-China relations).</p><p>GS does not think these conditions have yet been met, and continues to suggest a defensive posture; however, it does note that it is also easier to imagine how those conditions might be met in the weeks ahead than it was even a week or two ago.</p>",
