The Thanksgiving holiday saw a lack of any pertinent updates in the day. However, last night US President Trump signed the HK bill as expected, implying a sell off in US equity futures as participants were concerned regarding the potential implications to trade talks. The Chinese were quick to vow to retaliate, however the retaliation is likely to put the drafters of the bill on an entry ban to Mainland China, Hong Kong &amp; Macau, according to China Global Time. The retaliation, so far, appears not so severe, potentially a promising sign. Over in the UK, YouGov released its MPR model, which put Conservatives at a 68-seat majority, the results put a bid into GBP pushing cable to test resistance at 1.2950, before paring back to 1.29 during the day as USD strengthened slightly and gradually.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>After yesterday’s market close US President Trump signed the Hong Kong bill as expected, given the major backing from both the House and the Senate. The signing saw a sell off in equity futures on worries it may become a headwind to trade talks. However, desks have noted that the timing of the signing, the day before Thanksgiving to limit market exposure, may be a signal well received by China’s President Xi. The Chinese vowed to retaliate, however so far the only sign of a retaliation has been from China Global Times Editor Hu Xijin, often seen as a mouth piece for China, who stated based on what he knows, China is to ban those who drafted the bill from Mainland China, Hong Kong &amp; Macau. However, China Global Times citing analysts noted that House Speaker Pelosi, Senator Rubio, Cruz and Secretary of State Pompeo could be among those on the restricted entry list. Elsewhere, Xinhua reported China’s State Council will properly resolve trade frictions and will step up punishment for IP infringement, lower non-tariff trade barriers and step up policy support for trade developments.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN CPI: </strong>Headline German CPI for November missed expectations for a pick-up to 1.3%, and the pace remained unchanged at 1.1%, missing estimates for a rise to 1.3% Y/Y. The M/M fell deeper than expected, falling 0.8% vs. the 0.6% expectations. HICP Y/Y was in line with estimates at 1.2%, picking up from the prior 0.9%, although the M/M figure declined 0.8%, deeper than the consensus decline for a -0.7% print. Pantheon Macroeconomics advises that the CPI headline this month should be ignored given another fall in energy prices, as it declined 3.7% on the month, following a 2.1% decline the previous month, which offset the 1.8% rise in food prices and the 1.8% rise in services. The consultancy highlights that underlying inflation pressures for both core and non-energy components are solid and even slightly rising. Pantheon concludes, “we are relatively confident that the German HICP core rate increased a bit this month, though the underlying trend likely is stable, at around 1.5%.”</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Overnight, Yonhap suggested that North Korea launched two unidentified projectiles, which the Japanese Coast Guard believed it to be a missile, however the projectile likely fell outside of Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone, therefore it may not be as serious as previous missile tests. In the Middle-East, WSJ reported Qatar's Foreign Minister made a surprise offer to end the feud between the two whilst in Riyadh, noting \"Doha is willing to sever its ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political movement distrusted by the Saudi monarchy and its allies.\" Saudi Arabia is reportedly considering the proposal, according to an Arab official. The move reportedly signals a breakthrough in diplomatic tensions in the most serious effort yet to end the feud between the two, said US &amp; Arab officials.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> Last night YouGov released its latest MRP model, which accurately predicted the hung parliament in 2017. The model predicted a Conservative majority of 68 seats, holding 359 constituencies, above Labour’s 211. Blonde Money highlights the swing from Labour to Conservative in Great Grimsby, a seat she highlighted as a must-win for a Tory majority, had Conservatives at 42%, ahead of Labour’s 37%. The model also had Eastbourne switch to the Conservative’s with a vote of 48%, ahead of the current constituency’s party, Lib Dem’s, at 38%. It is a feel amongst analysts that as the election looms, it is becoming an increasingly two-horse race.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: EUR, USD, CNH: </strong>More positive commentary from China’s State Council facilitated a late morning recovery for the US dollar, though ranges have been thin in Thanksgiving Trade. The slight strength in the buck resulted in a leg lower in EURUSD, which was again straddling 1.1000 within a thin range. EZ data did little to help the single currency; though economic sentiment and consumer confidence were a touch better than expected, consumer inflation expectations were on the soft side, and inflation out of Germany missed expectations. CNH trades weaker vs the buck, after US President Trump signed the Hong Kong Bill, however, the severity of trade implications seems rather limited. The CNH has since continued higher to breach 7.0300 to the upside, despite more positive commentary from the Chinese State Council, who stated China will properly resolve trade frictions, step up punishment for IP infringement and lower non-tariff trade barriers, reported Xinhua.</p><p><strong>GBP, JPY, CHF: </strong>Sterling caught a bid last night after YouGov’s MPR model last night forecast a solid win for the Conservatives in the December election. The result sent Cable from 1.2890 to test resistance at 1.2950, a level it tested multiple times this morning. The Pound has since pared gains to finish marginally weaker vs the buck trading around the 1.29 level. EURGBP tested the 0.85 figure multiple times after the MRP results last night but was unable to breach the psychological level even yet again this morning. CHF and JPY are similarly flat, having pared last night’s safe-haven gains vs the buck. USDJPY climbed back north of the 109.50 mark, despite additional bearish impulses in the form of dire Japanese retail sales data and further missile launches out of North Korea, albeit of the short-range type.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD, SEK, NOK: </strong>Both Antipodean dollars were initially sent lower on trade concerns after Trump signed the Hong Kong Bill overnight, but the two have since diverged on account of strong ANZ Business Confidence data from New Zealand and weaker than forecast CapEx data out of Australia; the former sent AUDNZD through the 1.0550 handle to find support around 1.0526 (26 August low). Despite the market’s broadly weaker risk appetite and slightly softer oil prices, CAD and SEK trade rather flat against the buck and Euro respectively, where as NOK trades weaker. USDCAD found a ceiling at the 1.3300 handle before tracking back to lows around the 1.3275 mark. All three were uninterested by data; Canada’s current account deficit came out slightly larger than expected, with the prior also revised upwards, Swedish retail sales and sentiment/confidence data was firm, as was Norway’s credit indicator.</p><p><strong>EM: </strong>Most EMFX crosses are mixed, MXN is the significant underperformer after a dovish minutes, which expressed concerns about a continued deterioration of growth, whilst also confirming two board members, Heath and Esquivel, voted for a 50bp cut at the latest policy meeting. TRY and BRL trade firmer, with the former likely deriving some support from relatively upbeat Turkish economic confidence data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR, USD, CNH</strong></p><p>More positive commentary from China’s State Council facilitated a late morning recovery for the US dollar, though ranges have been thin in Thanksgiving Trade. The slight strength in the buck resulted in a leg lower in Eur/Usd, which was again straddling 1.1000 within a thin range. EZ data did little to help the single currency; though economic sentiment and consumer confidence were a touch better than expected, consumer inflation expectations were on the soft side, and inflation out of Germany missed expectations. CNH trades weaker vs the buck, after US President Trump signed the Hong Kong Bill, however, the severity of trade implications seems rather limited. The CNH has since continued higher to breach 7.0300 to the upside, despite more positive commentary from the Chinese State Council, who stated China will properly resolve trade frictions, step up punishment for IP infringement and lower non-tariff trade barriers, reported Xinhua.</p><p><strong>GBP, JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Sterling caught a bid last night after YouGov’s MPR model last night forecast a solid win for the Conservatives in the December election. The result sent Cable from 1.2890 to test resistance at 1.2950, a level it tested multiple times this morning. The Pound has since pared gains to finish marginally weaker vs the buck trading around the 1.29 level. EURGBP tested the 0.85 figure multiple times after the MRP results last night but was unable to breach the psychological level even yet again this morning. CHF and JPY are similarly flat, having pared last night’s safe-haven gains vs the buck. USDJPY climbed back north of the 109.50 mark, despite additional bearish impulses in the form of dire Japanese retail sales data and further missile launches out of North Korea, albeit of the short-range type.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD, SEK, NOK</strong></p><p>Both Antipodean dollars were initially sent lower on trade concerns after Trump signed the Hong Kong Bill overnight, but the two have since diverged on account of strong ANZ Business Confidence data from New Zealand and weaker than forecast CapEx data out of Australia; the former sent AUDNZD through the 1.0550 handle to find support around 1.0526 (26 August low). Despite the market’s broadly weaker risk appetite and slightly softer oil prices, CAD and SEK trade rather flat against the buck and Euro respectively, where as NOK trades weaker. USDCAD found a ceiling at the 1.3300 handle before tracking back to lows around the 1.3275 mark. All three were uninterested by data; Canada’s current account deficit came out slightly larger than expected, with the prior also revised upwards, Swedish retail sales and sentiment/confidence data was firm, as was Norway’s credit indicator.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Most EMFX crosses are mixed, MXN is the significant underperformer after a dovish minutes, which expressed concerns about a continued deterioration of growth, whilst also confirming two board members, Heath and Esquivel, voted for a 50bp cut at the latest policy meeting. TRY and BRL trade firmer, with the former likely deriving some support from relatively upbeat Turkish economic confidence data.</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Major European bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%) are broadly lower, with risk sentiment dented in wake of US President Trump’s signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights Bill to the consternation of China, who have threatened counter measures. “While this worsens the negotiation climate for a trade deal” note Danske Bank, “it is still our belief that the sides will be able to keep the Hong Kong issue separate and land a phase 1 deal before the 15 December when US-China import tariffs are scheduled to rise by 15%.” Elsewhere, FTSE 100 (-0.4%) is weighed on as a firmer Pound weighs on large-cap exporters after the YouGov MPR model predicted a healthy Conservative majority at the upcoming election, whilst heavy-weight miners bear the brunt on unfavourable base metal price action. However, Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.7%) stands as the underperformer thus far, with domestic banks all pressured by unwelcomed action in the Italian fixed income complex. Sectors are mostly in the red, with only Energy (+0.2%) and Materials (+0.1%) modestly in positive territory. Moving on to the stock specific movers; Telefonica (+1.5%) shares advance after the Co. revealed a major overhaul to its business; it will focus more on its domestic market, Brazil, UK and Germany, whilst its remaining 8 Latin American businesses will form a separate unit which could potentially be sold. Moreover, two new businesses, Telefonica Tech and Telefonica Infra, will be created as part of the overhaul, with profits expected to be boosted by EUR 2.0bln by 2022. Elsewhere amongst the gainers, Ambu (+1.2%) and Red Electrica (+1.3%) shares are bid after the Cos received upgrades at Handelsbanken and Citi respectively. In terms of the laggards; declining net earnings and revenue see Remy Cointreau (-3.2%) shares come under pressure. Elsewhere, Proximus (-2.1%) shares are lower after the Co. appointed Guillaume Boutin as its new Chief Executive, effective on December 1st.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - Sterling has extended its recovery rally from recent lows on the back of the latest UK election poll from YouGov that signals a relatively big win for PM Johnson and his Tory party at the forthcoming GE, albeit with the standard statistical error margins that could crimp the actual number of seats predicted to be claimed by the Conservatives. Cable has run into some resistance around 1.2950 and Eur/Gbp support circa 0.8500, but in thinner US Thanksgiving Holiday trade and with more month end models pointing to Dollar selling for portfolio rebalancing 1.3000 remains a realistic objective for the former, while a breach of the round number in the cross exposes 0.8475-70.</p><p>EUR/NZD/JPY/CHF - All firmer against the Greenback as the DXY topped out just ahead of 98.500 following yesterday’s post-US data rebound amidst slightly less friendly US-China ties on HK lines compared to the Phase 1 trade accord that is said to be increasingly close to completion. However, the single currency continues to struggle above the 1.1000 level and faces more option expiry-related supply due to 1.1 bn rolling off between 1.1025-30 at today’s NY cut with little impetus via any of the latest Eurozone data ranging from encouraging economic sentiment indicators and M3 metrics to benign German state CPIs. Similarly, the Kiwi is still finding the air rare over 0.6400 even with a more pronounced, while the Yen and Franc are paring some declines from 109.50+ and near parity troughs respectively regardless of contrasting macro releases (Japanese retail sales weak vs stronger than forecast Swiss GDP). Note, Usd/Jpy could maintain its upward trajectory on technical grounds if the pair settles above another Fib (109.37) after breaching 109.20 on Wednesday.</p><p>CAD/AUD/NOK/SEK - The G10 laggards, with the Loonie retreating further through 200 DMA resistance towards 1.3300 and Aussie meandering within a 0.6778-60 range following conflicting Q3 Capex figures overnight and as Aud/Nzd hovers near the bottom of 1.0558-24 parameters. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns have reversed course after failing to maintain bullish momentum through key chart levels yesterday against the Euro, as Eur/Nok bounces off sub-10.0750 lows to 10.1150+ and Eur/Sek to almost 10.5700 from around 10.5300 at one stage. Soft crude prices may be a factor hampering the Norwegian Krona, but its Swedish counterpart is not deriving any support from decent business sentiment or retail sales.</p><p>EM - In contrast to the above, relatively upbeat Turkish economic confidence may be assisting the Lira or alleviating some negatives given Usd/Try paring back from 5.7800+ peaks to retest support circa 5.7600.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It may well be far too premature, but not out of the realms to suggest that debt futures/cash bonds could have marked out the broad extremes for Thursday already. Indeed, Bunds are holding within their 171.30-60 boundaries, albeit nearer the lower end amidst some constructive China trade headlines, while Gilts remain above 133.00 and well between 132.89-133.23 confines and US Treasuries are even more constrained in outright terms having rotated around par for the bulk of the overnight session. However, a rather sluggish end of month Italian auction appears to have taken it’s toll on 10 year benchmark BTPs that recoiled further from 141.70 highs to just under 141.00 at one stage.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude markets are lower, with prices weighed by a combination of trade concerns after US President Trump signed the Hong Kong Bill and yesterday’s surprise build in crude inventories and larger-than expected build in gasoline stocks revealed by the EIA. Front month <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> contracts for now trade just above support in the form of yesterday’s post EIA data lows at the USD 57.50/bbl and USD 62.45/bbl marks. Elsewhere in crude specific news; Russia said that the exclusion of Russian gas condensate production from their output calculations for OPEC+ is going to be a topic of discussion regarding agreements post March 2020 at the upcoming OPEC+ meeting on December 6th, confirming overnight reports. The report noted that given the growth that the country has seen in gas output, condensate production has increased in tandem, leading ING to conclude that \"this would help to explain why Russia has failed to fully comply with the production cut deal for much of this year.\" Elsewhere, Libya's El Feel oil field (70k BPD) is said to have resumed production, after violence in the region which disrupted production yesterday. Looking at the metals, <strong>gold</strong> is slightly firmer, but struggling to gain impetus despite the more downbeat macro backdrop and slightly softer buck; the precious metal is off yesterday’s USD 1452/oz lows, but struggling to break above the USD 1458/oz level, which has capped the price action so far this morning. Meanwhile, the return of Hong Kong related US/China trade jitters has hit <strong>copper</strong> prices, which have continued to slide during European trade.</p>",

Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.2%)</strong> remained afloat as it took its cue from US counterparts and notched a fresh all-time high led by a resumption of the outperformance in telecoms. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.2%)</strong> was indecisive amid swings in the currency and following the worst decline in Retail Sales data since early 2015. In terms of Japan’s notable stock movers, Panasonic was the biggest gainer on reports it will offload its loss-making semiconductor division to a Taiwanese firm, while Japan Display was on the other end of the spectrum amid allegations of improper accounting. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%)</strong> weakened after US President Trump’s Hong Kong bill signing which prompted strong opposition from China’s Foreign Ministry and threats it will take firm countermeasures if the US continues in its interference. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower following the bear-flattening in the US and amid profit taking from recent gains, with demand also subdued as all metrics pointed to a weaker result for today’s 2yr auction.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

China also suggested the US attempts to interfere in Hong Kong are doomed to fail and that China will take firm countermeasures with the US to shoulder all consequences if it continues in this way. (Newswires) China Foreign Ministry says it summons US Ambassador in China and has lodged stern representations with US regarding Hong Kong rights law, while it urges US to correct its error. Hong Kong Government said the US bills harms HK-US relationship and interests, while it added that the bills obviously intervene in internal affairs which are unnecessary and unwanted. (Newswires)</p><p>Global Times tweeted that Chinese analysts noted that President Trump’s HK bill signing is not out of their expectation, as the US views Hong Kong as an important leverage and the act could become a new legal tool to exert. Furthermore, analysts suggested US President Trump may selectively implement provisions of the HK act as a leverage for trade talks but may put on hold those sanctions that are unfavourable for negotiations.

The initial knee-jerk reaction was volatile given that a significant Conservative majority had already been flagged earlier by a journalist, although the follow through from the highly anticipated poll eventually lifted the currency to around 1.2950 where it then met resistance. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> pulled back from near 6-month highs and antipodeans were also pressured after the announcement of President Trump’s Hong Kong bill signing, however, <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> later recovered after the ANZ business surveys printed the best reading so far this year, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> remained subdued after mixed Capital Expenditure data.</p><p>Australian Capital Expenditure (Q3) -0.2% vs. Exp. -0.1% (Prev. -0.5%).

(AFP)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The T-Note sold off modestly on Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday (lighter volumes), the selling pressures extended after the upside surprise to US GDP, providing some relief to investors’ outlook on the economy (GDP trackers were also revised higher after durable goods data, with Atlanta Fed now tracking 1.7% in Q4 vs 0.4% previously). The strong 7-year auction failed to provide a meaningful bid too, where the US sold USD 32bln of 7-year paper on the screws, with above average takedown from foreign bidders and B/C ratio, whilst dealers took less than average. The curve, in fact, bear flattened on the day, where despite a less-than-rosy PCE release, the front-end was sold the most (NOTE: the Fed has expressed its unwillingness to raise rates until inflation is comfortably above its 2% target, however). The 2s10s fell by around 1.5bps, flirting with the 14bps support level, whilst the 2s30s fell by just shy of 3bps; the 2-year yield settled 4bps higher. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 10 ticks lower at 129-12.</p><p><strong>Fed's Beige Book stated economic activity expanded modestly from October through mid-November and that outlooks generally remained positive</strong>, while employment continued to rise slightly overall even as labour markets remained tight. A majority of the 12 districts continued to note difficulty in hiring workers and some contacts noting their inability to fill jobs was limiting growth. Furthermore, wage pressures rose at a modest pace during the reporting period and most districts reported stable to moderately growing consumer spending, with increases in auto sales and tourism also seen in several districts.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as the jubilation from another record setting session on Wall St heading to Thanksgiving Day, quickly faded after US President Trump signed the Hong Kong bills into law which triggered some concerns of a potential derailment in US-China trade talks. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.2%) remained afloat as it took its cue from US counterparts and notched a fresh all-time high led by a resumption of the outperformance in telecoms. Nikkei 225 (Unch.) is indecisive amid swings in the currency and following the worst decline in Retail Sales data since early 2015. In terms of Japan’s notable stock movers, Panasonic is the biggest gainer on reports it will offload its loss-making semiconductor division to a Taiwanese firm, while Japan Display is on the other end of the spectrum amid allegations of improper accounting. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are off their lows although remain subdued after US President Trump’s Hong Kong bill signing which prompted strong opposition from China’s Foreign Ministry and threats it will take firm countermeasures if the US continues in its interference.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer and retraces the mild gains from yesterday’s better than expected US Q3 GDP and surprise expansion in Durable Goods, to the benefit of its major counterparts in which EUR/USD just about reclaimed the 1.1000 handle. GBP/USD is the outperformer after the YouGov MRP model suggested the Conservatives are on track for a 68-seat majority with the party projected to win 359 seats and with Labour at 211 seats. The initial knee-jerk reaction was volatile given that a significant Conservative majority had already been flagged by a journalist, although the follow through from the highly anticipated poll eventually lifted the currency to around 1.2950 where it then met resistance. Elsewhere, USD/JPY pulled back from near 6-month highs and antipodeans were also pressured after the announcement of President Trump’s Hong Kong bill signing although NZD/USD later recovered after the ANZ business surveys printed the best reading so far this year, while AUD/USD remained subdued after mixed Capital Expenditure data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower following the bear-flattening in the US and amid profit taking from recent gains, with demand also subdued ahead of today’s 2yr auction.</p>",
