(Newswires)</p><p>USTR Lighthizer said \"we'll see\" about a China trade deal and that we have communication back and forth when asked about a timeline for a trade deal, while he added it is his job is to get a good deal. (Newswires)</p><p>China will not take the blame for rising pork prices globally and that the US should be grateful for China’s announcement that it will exclude some agricultural products including pork from additional tariffs on US goods. In other news, China is accelerating the public listings of chip companies on Shanghai’s STAR stock market in the latest initiative by Beijing to counter US technology sanctions and speed the development of its semiconductor industry. (Global Times/Nikkei)</p><p>US President Trump said he is announcing the first stage of the new Japanese trade deal which is taking steps towards a fair trade agreement and that Japan will open the market to USD 7bln of US agricultural products, while he added that they reached a deal on strong commitments for up to USD 40bln on digital trade. (Newswires)</p><p>US Trade Representative Lighithizer said cars are not included in the agreement with Japan but the two sides are to discuss it and stated that it is not in the intentions of the US to put section 232 tariffs on Japan. Furthermore, Lighthizer stated that once deal has been implemented, over 90% of US food and agricultural products exported into Japan will be duty free or receive preferential tariff access and that talks on a phase 2 agreement will start at the end of April/beginning of May next year. (Newswires)</p><p>Japanese official was said to be confident US President Trump won't pursue auto tariffs based on verbal commitments and joint statements that countries would refrain from taking measures against the spirit of agreements. (Politico)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK Government warned that if the opposition does not take up a vote of no confidence tonight, they will assume parliament is behind the Brexit plan where UK PM Johnson does not rule out a second prorogation in order to achieve it. However, UK opposition Labour Party leader Corbyn will not table a no confidence motion in the government and accordingly there will not be a vote tomorrow. (Sky/Sun)</p><p>Irish PM Varadkar said he thinks we're a good bit away from a request for an extension from the UK at this stage and reaffirmed his view that Ireland would be open to granting an extension if the UK asked for it. However, Varadkar also noted there are a lot of other European countries though that are increasingly skeptical about whether there should be an extension or not and would want it to happen for a good reason. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Lautenschlaeger (Hawk) resigned from the ECB board in which she is set to step down from her position on October 31st which is 2 years early as a result of her opposition to the ECB's recent stimulatory packages.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US issued new Iran-related sanction on Chinese entities and individuals includes Cosco Shipping Tanker and China Concord Petroleum, while US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US is sanctioning the Chinese entities due to knowingly lifting oil cargoes from Iran and warned Iran that the more it acts irresponsibly, the more severe sanctions will be. (Newswires)</p><p>Iran President Rouhani said Tehran is committed to the 2015 nuclear deal but Iran’s patience has a limit and that if the US wants more than the deal, they will have to pay more. Furthermore, there were reports that Iran's proposed amendments to the nuclear deal calls for early approval of additional protocols by Iran's Parliament and the removal of sanctions by the US. (Newswires)</p><p>Iranian official said the possibility of a meeting between Iranian President Rouhani and US President Trump is zero. In other news, Iran Foreign Minister Zarif said the lifting of the detention of the UK tanker Stena Impero was finalised on Wednesday but the ship still faces charges.

(Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Evans (voter, dove) said he is open-minded to another rate cut if \"data comes in that way\" although suggested the current setting is okay and current policy is accommodative which he expects will lift inflation to the target. Fed’s Evans also noted that the economy is really \"quite solid\" with the US on a good growth path but not \"outrageously\" strong, while he added that he sees economic growth of 2.0%-2.5% going forward but noted President Trump's \"brinksmanship\" trade methods have created uncertainty. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump urged Ukrainian President Zelensky to contact Attorney General Barr about opening an inquiry related to Joe Biden according to the transcript. In related news, sources close to President Trump noted suggestions the Senate will never move regarding impeachment which probably means USMCA doesn't get done and probably throws the legislative agenda completely over the cliff.

Its geographical revenue breakdown was also stronger y/y globally, even in China, showing the trade war is not having too much of a detrimental effect on the retail giant. Cintas (CTAS) also higher after strong earnings and a guidance raise. Talks between Altria (MO) &amp; Phillip Morris (PM) have fallen through, which lead to Altria tightening its FY19 earnings guidance. As thus, the CEO of Juul is to step down with former Altria executive KC Crosthwaite to take the role. Best Buy (BBY) announced a new growth strategy targeting FY25 enterprise revenue of USD 50bln as well as planning an additional USD 1bln in cost savings by the same year. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) received a letter from Elliot Management which called for a breakup of the company into three separate businesses, its Midstream, Retail and Refining companies; a view also reportedly backed by De Shaw. AT&amp;T (T) announced it does not plan on selling its DirecTV, something Elliot Management have pushed for in recent weeks. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced a partnership to deliver the future of gaming, starting from next month, putting more competition into the gaming industry. Boeing (BA) flying in the right direction by adding an established permanent aerospace safety committee. eBay (EBAY) appointed an interim CEO and will consider both internal and external members for the full-time position. S&amp;P 500 0.6% at 2985, NASDAQ-100 1.2% at 7804, Dow Jones 0.6% at 26971.</p><p>The Treasury curve has bear-steepened, with major curve spreads generally wider, and yields up across the curve. Yields rose in afternoon trade on optimism about progress on US/China trade talks, after US President Trump said a China trade deal was possible, while transcripts released by the White House do not show a clear point the Democrats can impeach US President Trump on. A soft 5-year auction, which tailed 0.9bps, with sponsorship below average; in wake of the poor auction, yields continued to rise, helping the curve steepen. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 24+ ticks lower at 129-30+.</p>",

China responded to US President Trump's punchy speech at the UN, saying that the UN was a place to listen to other nations, not to launch verbal attacks. Nevertheless, reports state that China is preparing to buy more US pork, as trade talks revive (although the domestic shortages as a result of the African swine fever may be the driving factor); Bloomberg reported that buyers are making inquiries, and while volumes are not finalised, purchases of around 100k tonnes have been touted. China’s Global Times newspaper reported that China itself would not take the blame for risking pork prices globally, and that the US should be grateful for China’s announcement it will exclude some agricultural products (including pork) from additional tariffs on US goods. On trade negotiations, Foreign Minister Wang said trade negotiations cannot happen under threats, and neither US nor China could move ahead without the other, and that opening up as well as integration represent the way forward; Wang added that China will not close the door to its economy which will only open wider.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP IMPEACHMENT: </strong>At worst, transcripts of a call between US President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart reveal that he pressed Ukraine to investigate Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden; crucially, there was nothing in the transcript that suggested Trump was bargaining aid for an investigation. Nevertheless, Democrat House leader Pelosi said she will still pursue an impeachment investigation, claiming that the transcript confirms that the President’s behaviour undermines the integrity of US elections and national security.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MECHANICS: </strong>House Speaker Pelosi has stated the House is to open a formal impeachment inquiry into US President Trump. The impeachment proceedings are due to the President having seriously violated the Constitution; regarding allegations that US President Trump has reportedly pressured Ukraine President Zelensky to investigate former US VP Joe Biden, who is also a 2020 Presidential candidate. The route essentially involves an investigation, a House Vote, and then a possible Senate trial/vote. <strong>Investigation:</strong> Speaker Pelosi has instructed the six House committees to proceed under the ‘umbrella’ of a formal enquiry, the six committees are; Judiciary, Intelligence, Ways &amp; Means, Financial Services, Oversight and Foreign Affairs. The committees had already been investigating the President, but the instigation of formal proceedings should, in theory, compel the necessary officials to cooperate with the investigation. <strong>House Vote:</strong> For the proceedings to pass through the House of Representatives, the six committees’ investigations must first pass a referral vote from the Judiciary Committee. Subsequently, if approved, the articles would then be passed to the full House. At this point a simple majority is required. Currently within the House of Representatives there are 435 members composed of 235 Democrats, 198 Republicans, one Independent and one vacancy. As such, a simple majority of 218 members is required. Currently, 154 members of the Democratic Caucus are in favour of impeachment, therefore an additional 64 House Representatives are required. If the proceedings attain a simple majority then, unless the President resigns, it is raised to the Senate. <strong>Senate:</strong> Within the Senate there are currently 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two Independents. For the impeachment proceedings to pass through the Senate a 2/3 majority (67) is necessary. Typically, following the House vote there is a Senate trial. However, given the clear Republican majority it is unclear as to whether such a trial would take place. Other notable points: The House of Representatives begins a two-week recess after this week, which will evidently delay proceedings and possibly remove some of the urgency around it. The handing over of the ‘Whistle Blower Report’ by the White House may serve as an alternative route for Democrats. Trump has announced he will release the transcript of the phone call with the Ukrainian President; but as of yet no further indication has been given regarding the whistle blower report.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Coeure says that Euro short-term rate responded precisely as expected and the ECB rate reduction was fully priced through. Elsewhere, Italy is set to nominate BOI’s Panetta to the six-man ECB Executive Board, according to sources. Meanwhile, ECB’s Lautenschlager has left her role at the ECB two years early, on account of her opposition to the new package of easing measures, WSJ reported.</p><p><strong>* FED REPO: </strong>Once again, demand was strong at the NY Fed's overnight repo operation, which saw USD 91.95bln, for an allocation of USD 75bln. The NY Fed announced that. It would increase the size of its overnight repo operation to USD 100bln (Prev. 75bln) and the 14-day term repo has been upsides to USD 60bln (Prev. 30bln) for Thursday’s operations. Rabobank says that the strong demand adds to speculation that the Fed will have to begin conducting a technical expansion of its balance sheet through buying US Treasuries, in order that it can continue to use an operational framework for controlling rates that is a floor system and so relies on there being 'excess' excess reserves. Rabobank says the other option available for the Fed would be to put in place some form of permanent repo facility. But Rabo thinks that the Fed has generally been keen to reduce its footprint in money markets, and this would not be the case if it did introduce such a facility. It would also be somewhat of a Frankenstein mixture of a floor and corridor system, the bank argues.</p><p><strong>* REPO AND THE USD:</strong> Cautious trading conditions have lent to USD strength. Morgan Stanley notes that the buck faces pressure from the Fed potentially having to increase reserves, while global monetary policymakers passing the baton on to fiscal authorities may also pose fiscal divergence plays to sell the USD ahead, as fiscal expansion reduces international savings that are standing ready to fund US' deficits. MS also notes that between 2015-2019, the DXY declines on average by about 0.13% around days when US overnight GC repo rate volatility spikes, adding that while this may understate the USD reaction since rates volatility was sometimes driven by foreign central banks' dovish surprises. But going forward, MS says that a logical assumption would be that when money market volatility has its roots in the US, USD should decline. The bank says that quarter end pressures this week might see repo rates spike again (Thursday through Monday are the days to watch, MS says) as a result of large banks’ reduced willingness to carry out repo intermediation.</p><p><strong>* FED SPEAKERS ON REPO: </strong>Fed's Evans noted issues in the repo market included the level of reserves, and whether they are concentrated in certain institutions (something which NY Fed President Williams has previously alluded to) and how regulatory changes have affected how firms hold reserves. Evans said the repo operation could be a signal that the balance sheet is tighter than had been anticipated but defended the Fed by saying it acted timely and effective to the repo market. Evans also said he is open minded on setting up a repo facility, saying it could be the case that a flat-out larger balance sheet could ease potential for repo problems. Meanwhile, Fed's Brainard said the recent repo market trouble is due to a confluence of factors, and technical issues.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Evans (voter, dovish)</strong> said the economy is really \"quite solid\", on a good growth path but not \"outrageously\" strong, current policy is accommodative and he expects this will lift inflation to target and sees economic growth of 2% to 2.5% going forward (in-line with the FOMC’s 2.2% GDP growth consensus). The Chicago Fed President, who has recently provided remarks on the dovish side, struck a more positive/hawkish tone, saying policy needs to be \"on guard\", but not trying to overcome risks that haven't yet materialized (seemingly at odds with “insurance” policy), later adding that he is open-minded to another rate cut if \"data comes in that way\", but at the moment, current setting is okay. Evans noted that Trump's \"brinksmanship\" trade methods have created uncertainty, and that the yield curve is a concern, which he believes is a function of markets pricing uncertainty and nervousness but feels good economic fundamentals could go on indefinitely. <strong>Fed’s Bullard</strong> (voter, dovish dissenter) intimated that he wants another 25bps rate cut by the end of the year (he voted for 50bps at the last meeting, but notes the Fed cut 25bps at that meeting), although he emphasised a data dependent approach.</p><p><strong>* US/JAPAN: </strong>US President Trump and Japanese PM Abe announced they are signing the first stage of a new trade deal which will open the market to USD7bln (other wires stated 70bln) worth of agricultural products. The two reached a deal on strong commitments for up to USD 40bln on digital trade, as well as the removal, or lowering, of tariffs on certain industrial goods. The trade deal between the two shows a positive sign where they are to continue talks for a phase 2 at the end of April/beginning of May 2020. The nations intend to complete trade consultations within four months once the initial agreement is underway. Recent days, however, have shown reports that talks between the two had hit a snag as the Japanese sought reassurance from the US that there will be no implementation of national security tariffs on Japanese cars and auto parts. Details surrounding autos in this first step deal were slim, however Politico reported a Japanese official was confident that Trump will not pursue the auto tariffs based on the verbal commitments and joint statements that countries would refrain from taking measures against the spirit of agreements. Following the report, US Trade Representative Lighthizer also announced cars are not included in this agreement, but the two parties are to further discuss the matter, whilst mentioning the US does not intend to put section 232 tariffs on Japan, which refers to the national security tariffs on autos and auto-parts; later confirmed by both parties. A Japanese government statement said that US tariffs on autos and auto-parts will be eliminated through further talks, although no time frame has been set.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ: </strong>Following August's surprise 50bps rate cut, the Reserve Bank held rates at 1.00% in September, as the consensus had predicted. While the MPC did not directly signal another cut was imminent, it has left the door open for lower rates, offering to ease policy \"if necessary\" (downgraded from \"may \"be required\") and \"a lower OCR may be needed over time.\" The statement noted \"interest rates can be expected to be low for longer\"; TD Securities said that the lack of mention of \"lower\" is consistent with a conditional easing bias (the August statement read \"a lower OCR is necessary to continue to meet its employment and inflation objectives\"). TD notes that the central bank still sees risks to the downside on global trade, geopolitics, low business confidence, a delay to fiscal policy, as well as low inflation. \"We had anticipated the Bank to point to downside risks to its 2020 GDP forecasts, but the RBNZ was positive on the outlook 1-year out, so this did come as a surprise.\" On the NZD, the RBNZ seems happy with the depreciation following the August MPC (down around 2.75% since then), with the decline in the NZD TWI exceeding the central bank's 3.5% forecast. Looking ahead, TD says that in the near-term, the ANZ's Business Outlook survey on 30th September and the NZIER's Quarterly Business Survey on 1st October will be key. \"For now the market has scaled back the probability of the RBNZ cutting at its Nov meeting to 80% from nearly 90%, and the NZD is only slightly firmer from this morning's open,\" TD Securities writes, adding \"although the RBNZ offered a contingent easing bias and a balanced outlook 1 year out, we retain our 25bps cut to 0.75% in Nov. We see downside risks to domestic growth and susceptibility to weaker offshore conditions as likely catalysts for a Nov cut to 0.75%.\"</p><p><strong>* BOJ MINUTES:</strong> The accounts for the July meeting showed that policymakers held a discussion about easing policy pre-emptively to respond to downside inflation risks, as well as risks from a stronger JPY, which analysts have suggested signals the possibility of action at the BOJ's October meeting.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Parliament has reconvened, PM Johnson has refused to resign, opposition is split about tabling a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, out of fears it could lead to a General Election before the UK has requested an extension of A50, which would mitigate the possibility of a 'no deal by accident'. In Parliament today, Johnson challenged the opposition benches to move a motion of no confidence in his government, which the opposition is unlikely to bite on. Reports suggested that if the opposition do not take up Johnson’s offer, then the government will likely assume that Parliament backs his Brexit approach, and Johnson will therefore not rule out a second prorogation, according to a Sky reporter. But for markets, the main implication is likely to be how the decision plays politically going into what now appears to be an inevitable general election sometime in late November/early December, RBC says. Even before yesterday’s ruling the odds of a no-deal Brexit had reduced significantly, given the legislation passed by parliament before the prorogation took effect had limited the ability of the government to leave the EU at the end of October without having a withdrawal deal in place. RBC notes that the 'Benn law' states that if by 19th October the Government has not secured backing from the House of Commons for either a withdrawal deal or leaving the EU without a deal, then the PM is compelled to seek an A50 extension, and delay Brexit until the end of January 2020 (whether Johnson will follow through on this remains to be seen). RBC says at this stage it is practically impossible to engineer general election before 31st October given that it takes at least five weeks to organise one in the UK. But the key remains how much this has dented Johnson's support; recent polls have put the Tories 7-8 points ahead of Labour, but analysts say a larger margin would be required for the Conservatives to secure a parliamentary majority (such an outcome that would see the odds of a no-deal Brexit rise again, RBC says). GBP traders would do well to monitor polling over the coming days.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 24+ TICKS LOWER AT 129-30+. </strong>The Treasury curve has bear-steepened, with major curve spreads generally wider, and yields up across the curve. Yields rose in afternoon trade on optimism about progress on US/China trade talks, after US President Trump said a China trade deal was possible, while transcripts released by the White House do not show a clear point the Democrats can impeach US President Trump on. A soft 5-year auction, which tailed 0.9bps, with sponsorship below average; in wake of the poor auction, yields continued to rise, helping the curve steepen.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The 7-year sector is trading rich in asset swap, SocGen says, though it is trading fair on the fly against 5s and 10s. Last month's auction was soft, tailing and seeing the weakest cover ratio since 7-year auctions resumed in 2009. Meanwhile, SocGen observes that the current WI is trading above last month's stop-out rate, which could provide support for the auction. SocGen also says that any quarter-end purchases, along with month-end extension demand, could also be positive for the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral view of the auction.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLES USD 0.80 LOWER AT USD 56.49/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES 0.71 LOWER AT USD 62.39:</strong> Crude futures came under pressure from the subdued risk appetite, rising energy inventories and Aramco supply updates on Wednesday. Saudi Aramco has, as according to several sources, restored its oil production capacity to 11.3mln BPD, with production at the affected Abqaiq facility and Khurais oilfield at 4.92mln BPD and 1.3mln BPD, respectively, with the announcement providing markets assurance on the Kingdom’s return to production capacity a week earlier than previous reports suggested. It was reported that Saudi crude exports were averaging 5.875mln BPD in the 10 days following the Aramco attacks, down by approximately 1.5mln BPD from the first 13-days of September; theoretically, the export figures should revive to the pre-attack figures now that Aramco has supposedly restored its production capacity, which will be evident in the physical market, however, Aramco also announced that it was unlikely it would IPO this year following the attacks. Elsewhere, Benchmarks came under pressure after the EIA inventory data release printed a surprise 2.4mln bbls build in crude stocks (greater than the API report too), Cushing posted a chunky 2.3mln bbls build, gasoline stocks built by 0.5mln bbls although distillates did draw by 3.0mln bbls (refinery utilisation declined by 1.4%). The EIA reported production ramping up to 12.5mln BPD from 12.4mln BPD, whilst net imports also decreased (a larger decline in imports than the fall in exports).</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.6% at 2985, NASDAQ-100 1.2% at 7804, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.6% at 26971;</strong> SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 1%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.2%, Energy&nbsp; 0.2%, Financials&nbsp; 0.7%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.5%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.7%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1.2%, Materials&nbsp; 0.6%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Nike (NKE) reported stellar earnings last night which beat on both top and bottom lines. Its geographical revenue breakdown was also stronger y/y globally, even in China, showing the trade war is not having too much of a detrimental effect on the retail giant. Cintas (CTAS) also higher after strong earnings and a guidance raise. Talks between Altria (MO) &amp; Phillip Morris (PM) have fallen through, which lead to Altria tightening its FY19 earnings guidance. As thus, the CEO of Juul is to step down with former Altria executive KC Crosthwaite to take the role. Best Buy (BBY) announced a new growth strategy targeting FY25 enterprise revenue of USD 50bln as well as planning an additional USD 1bln in cost savings by the same year. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) received a letter from Elliot Management which called for a breakup of the company into three separate businesses, its Midstream, Retail and Refining companies; a view also reportedly backed by De Shaw. AT&amp;T (T) announced it does not plan on selling its DirecTV, something Elliot Management have pushed for in recent weeks. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced a partnership to deliver the future of gaming, starting from next month, putting more competition into the gaming industry. Boeing (BA) flying in the right direction by adding an established permanent aerospace safety committee. eBay (EBAY) appointed an interim CEO and will consider both internal and external members for the full-time position.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The buck was initially stronger on risk aversion, which saw the EUR under pressure, relinquishing the 1.10 area. Havens are heading into Asia with an offered tone; the JPY is also seeing sellers after BOJ dovish minutes, while gold slipped on friendly US/China trade comments, as Treasuries fell, boosting real yields. The Kiwi rose in wake of the RBNZ rate decision; while some had suggested that the release was not as dovish as hoped for, others said that NZD traders are not comfortable with waiting for the central bank, and chose to cover shorts; this helped AUDNZD rise, although the AUD has succumbed to the USD strength, trading negative. GBP is lower as Brexit headline risk returns with a vengeance. EMFX is mixed. Meanwhile, with Trump impeachment newsflow increasing, there are concerns that Congress will not be able to vote on the USMCA this year, although the news did little to directly impact CAD and MXN on Wednesday.</p>",

Evans noted that Trump's \"brinksmanship\" trade methods have created uncertainty, and that the yield curve is a concern, which he believes is a function of markets pricing uncertainty and nervousness but feels good economic fundamentals could go on indefinitely. <strong>Fed’s Bullard</strong> (voter, dovish dissenter) intimated that he wants another 25bps rate cut by the end of the year (he voted for 50bps at the last meeting, but notes the Fed cut 25bps at that meeting), although he emphasised a data dependent approach.</p><p><strong>* US/JAPAN: </strong>US President Trump and Japanese PM Abe announced they are signing the first stage of a new trade deal which will open the market to USD7bln (other wires stated 70bln) worth of agricultural products. The two reached a deal on strong commitments for up to USD 40bln on digital trade, as well as the removal, or lowering, of tariffs on certain industrial goods. The trade deal between the two shows a positive sign where they are to continue talks for a phase 2 at the end of April/beginning of May 2020. The nations intend to complete trade consultations within four months once the initial agreement is underway. Recent days, however, have shown reports that talks between the two had hit a snag as the Japanese sought reassurance from the US that there will be no implementation of national security tariffs on Japanese cars and auto parts. Details surrounding autos in this first step deal were slim, however Politico reported a Japanese official was confident that Trump will not pursue the auto tariffs based on the verbal commitments and joint statements that countries would refrain from taking measures against the spirit of agreements. Following the report, US Trade Representative Lighthizer also announced cars are not included in this agreement, but the two parties are to further discuss the matter, whilst mentioning the US does not intend to put section 232 tariffs on Japan, which refers to the national security tariffs on autos and auto-parts; later confirmed by both parties. A Japanese government statement said that US tariffs on autos and auto-parts will be eliminated through further talks, although no time frame has been set.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ: </strong>Following August's surprise 50bps rate cut, the Reserve Bank held rates at 1.00% in September, as the consensus had predicted. While the MPC did not directly signal another cut was imminent, it has left the door open for lower rates, offering to ease policy \"if necessary\" (downgraded from \"may \"be required\") and \"a lower OCR may be needed over time.\" The statement noted \"interest rates can be expected to be low for longer\"; TD Securities said that the lack of mention of \"lower\" is consistent with a conditional easing bias (the August statement read \"a lower OCR is necessary to continue to meet its employment and inflation objectives\"). TD notes that the central bank still sees risks to the downside on global trade, geopolitics, low business confidence, a delay to fiscal policy, as well as low inflation. \"We had anticipated the Bank to point to downside risks to its 2020 GDP forecasts, but the RBNZ was positive on the outlook 1-year out, so this did come as a surprise.\" On the NZD, the RBNZ seems happy with the depreciation following the August MPC (down around 2.75% since then), with the decline in the NZD TWI exceeding the central bank's 3.5% forecast. Looking ahead, TD says that in the near-term, the ANZ's Business Outlook survey on 30th September and the NZIER's Quarterly Business Survey on 1st October will be key. \"For now the market has scaled back the probability of the RBNZ cutting at its Nov meeting to 80% from nearly 90%, and the NZD is only slightly firmer from this morning's open,\" TD Securities writes, adding \"although the RBNZ offered a contingent easing bias and a balanced outlook 1 year out, we retain our 25bps cut to 0.75% in Nov. We see downside risks to domestic growth and susceptibility to weaker offshore conditions as likely catalysts for a Nov cut to 0.75%.\"</p><p><strong>* BOJ MINUTES:</strong> The accounts for the July meeting showed that policymakers held a discussion about easing policy pre-emptively to respond to downside inflation risks, as well as risks from a stronger JPY, which analysts have suggested signals the possibility of action at the BOJ's October meeting.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Parliament has reconvened, PM Johnson has refused to resign, opposition is split about tabling a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, out of fears it could lead to a General Election before the UK has requested an extension of A50, which would mitigate the possibility of a 'no deal by accident'. In Parliament today, Johnson challenged the opposition benches to move a motion of no confidence in his government, which the opposition is unlikely to bite on. Reports suggested that if the opposition do not take up Johnson’s offer, then the government will likely assume that Parliament backs his Brexit approach, and Johnson will therefore not rule out a second prorogation, according to a Sky reporter. But for markets, the main implication is likely to be how the decision plays politically going into what now appears to be an inevitable general election sometime in late November/early December, RBC says. Even before yesterday’s ruling the odds of a no-deal Brexit had reduced significantly, given the legislation passed by parliament before the prorogation took effect had limited the ability of the government to leave the EU at the end of October without having a withdrawal deal in place. RBC notes that the 'Benn law' states that if by 19th October the Government has not secured backing from the House of Commons for either a withdrawal deal or leaving the EU without a deal, then the PM is compelled to seek an A50 extension, and delay Brexit until the end of January 2020 (whether Johnson will follow through on this remains to be seen). RBC says at this stage it is practically impossible to engineer general election before 31st October given that it takes at least five weeks to organise one in the UK. But the key remains how much this has dented Johnson's support; recent polls have put the Tories 7-8 points ahead of Labour, but analysts say a larger margin would be required for the Conservatives to secure a parliamentary majority (such an outcome that would see the odds of a no-deal Brexit rise again, RBC says). GBP traders would do well to monitor polling over the coming days.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 24+ TICKS LOWER AT 129-30+. </strong>The Treasury curve has bear-steepened, with major curve spreads generally wider, and yields up across the curve. Yields rose in afternoon trade on optimism about progress on US/China trade talks, after US President Trump said a China trade deal was possible, while transcripts released by the White House do not show a clear point the Democrats can impeach US President Trump on. A soft 5-year auction, which tailed 0.9bps, with sponsorship below average; in wake of the poor auction, yields continued to rise, helping the curve steepen.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The 7-year sector is trading rich in asset swap, SocGen says, though it is trading fair on the fly against 5s and 10s. Last month's auction was soft, tailing and seeing the weakest cover ratio since 7-year auctions resumed in 2009. Meanwhile, SocGen observes that the current WI is trading above last month's stop-out rate, which could provide support for the auction. SocGen also says that any quarter-end purchases, along with month-end extension demand, could also be positive for the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral view of the auction.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLES USD 0.80 LOWER AT USD 56.49/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES 0.71 LOWER AT USD 62.39:</strong> Crude futures came under pressure from the subdued risk appetite, rising energy inventories and Aramco supply updates on Wednesday. Saudi Aramco has, as according to several sources, restored its oil production capacity to 11.3mln BPD, with production at the affected Abqaiq facility and Khurais oilfield at 4.92mln BPD and 1.3mln BPD, respectively, with the announcement providing markets assurance on the Kingdom’s return to production capacity a week earlier than previous reports suggested. It was reported that Saudi crude exports were averaging 5.875mln BPD in the 10 days following the Aramco attacks, down by approximately 1.5mln BPD from the first 13-days of September; theoretically, the export figures should revive to the pre-attack figures now that Aramco has supposedly restored its production capacity, which will be evident in the physical market, however, Aramco also announced that it was unlikely it would IPO this year following the attacks. Elsewhere, Benchmarks came under pressure after the EIA inventory data release printed a surprise 2.4mln bbls build in crude stocks (greater than the API report too), Cushing posted a chunky 2.3mln bbls build, gasoline stocks built by 0.5mln bbls although distillates did draw by 3.0mln bbls (refinery utilisation declined by 1.4%). The EIA reported production ramping up to 12.5mln BPD from 12.4mln BPD, whilst net imports also decreased (a larger decline in imports than the fall in exports).</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.6% at 2985, NASDAQ-100 1.2% at 7804, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.6% at 26971;</strong> SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 1%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.2%, Energy&nbsp; 0.2%, Financials&nbsp; 0.7%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.5%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.7%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1.2%, Materials&nbsp; 0.6%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Nike (NKE) reported stellar earnings last night which beat on both top and bottom lines. Its geographical revenue breakdown was also stronger y/y globally, even in China, showing the trade war is not having too much of a detrimental effect on the retail giant. Cintas (CTAS) also higher after strong earnings and a guidance raise. Talks between Altria (MO) &amp; Phillip Morris (PM) have fallen through, which lead to Altria tightening its FY19 earnings guidance. As thus, the CEO of Juul is to step down with former Altria executive KC Crosthwaite to take the role. Best Buy (BBY) announced a new growth strategy targeting FY25 enterprise revenue of USD 50bln as well as planning an additional USD 1bln in cost savings by the same year. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) received a letter from Elliot Management which called for a breakup of the company into three separate businesses, its Midstream, Retail and Refining companies; a view also reportedly backed by De Shaw. AT&amp;T (T) announced it does not plan on selling its DirecTV, something Elliot Management have pushed for in recent weeks. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced a partnership to deliver the future of gaming, starting from next month, putting more competition into the gaming industry. Boeing (BA) flying in the right direction by adding an established permanent aerospace safety committee. eBay (EBAY) appointed an interim CEO and will consider both internal and external members for the full-time position.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The buck was initially stronger on risk aversion, which saw the EUR under pressure, relinquishing the 1.10 area. Havens are heading into Asia with an offered tone; the JPY is also seeing sellers after BOJ dovish minutes, while gold slipped on friendly US/China trade comments, as Treasuries fell, boosting real yields. The Kiwi rose in wake of the RBNZ rate decision; while some had suggested that the release was not as dovish as hoped for, others said that NZD traders are not comfortable with waiting for the central bank, and chose to cover shorts; this helped AUDNZD rise, although the AUD has succumbed to the USD strength, trading negative. GBP is lower as Brexit headline risk returns with a vengeance. EMFX is mixed. Meanwhile, with Trump impeachment newsflow increasing, there are concerns that Congress will not be able to vote on the USMCA this year, although the news did little to directly impact CAD and MXN on Wednesday.</p>",

Saudi Aramco has, as according to several sources, restored its oil production capacity to 11.3mln BPD, with production at the affected Abqaiq facility and Khurais oilfield at 4.92mln BPD and 1.3mln BPD, respectively, with the announcement providing markets assurance on the Kingdom’s return to production capacity a week earlier than previous reports suggested. It was reported that Saudi crude exports were averaging 5.875mln BPD in the 10 days following the Aramco attacks, down by approximately 1.5mln BPD from the first 13-days of September; theoretically, the export figures should revive to the pre-attack figures now that Aramco has supposedly restored its production capacity, which will be evident in the physical market, however, Armaco also announced that it was unlikely it would IPO this year following the attacks. Elsewhere, Benchmarks came under pressure after the EIA inventory data release printed a surprise 2.4mln bbl build in crude stocks (greater than the API report too), Cushing posted a chunky 2.3mln bbl build, gasoline stocks built by 0.5mln bbls although distillates did draw by 3.0mln bbls (refinery utilisation declined by 1.4%). The EIA reported production ramping up to 12.5mln BPD from 12.4mln BPD, whilst net imports also decreased (a larger decline in imports than the fall in exports).</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Very much a Dollar story today as the Index rebounded with a vengeance, nursed yesterday’s losses and topped the weekly high of 98.83. Gains in the index have been supported by comments from Fed-voter Evans (usually dovish) who took a slightly more neutral stance as he noted the US economy is \"quite solid and is posting good growth. Further, the Fed member sees economic growth of 2% to 2.5% going forward vs. the FOMC’s latest projection of 2.2%. Participants are likely to keep an eye on events at Capitol Hill amid the impeachment inquiry into US President Trump, although the release of the transcript seem to be less grave than people feared given that Trump only asked for an inquiry related to 2020 Presidential candidate Biden, but the transcript does not make it clear if the US President withheld funds in order to get the Ukrainian President to investigate Biden. DXY is poised to end the EU session at fresh weekly highs closer to the top of today’s 98.36-91 range, whilst tomorrow’s docket State-side consist of US Final GDP, Initial Jobless Claims and a slew of Fed speakers including Kaplan (Non-voter), Bullard (Voter, Dissenter), Clarida (Voter), Daily (Non-voter), Kashkari (Non-Voter) and Barkin (Non-Voter).</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound stands as the marked laggard today as parliament returned to business with PM Johnson due to give his statement at around 1630BST following the Supreme Court’s ruling of the prorogation as unlawful, although the firmer Greenback has dragged GBP/USD back below 1.2400 (after breaching support at 1.2410-15) to a low of 1.2365 after tripping stops at 1.2390. Cable remains at fresh weekly lows and await the PM’s statement for further impetus. Meanwhile, EUR/USD has lost the 1.10 handle amid a further Dollar strength after President Trump’s transcript was released, the Single Currency is set to the end EU trade at session lows with ECB’s de Guindos and Villeroy on tomorrow’s docket.</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD, CAD</strong></p><p>All lower as the strength in the Dollar, lower oil and commodity prices and risk-off sentiment all weighed on the high-beta currencies. NZD/USD fell from a post-RBNZ intraday high of 0.6348 to a low of 0.6275. To recap, the RBNZ reached a consensus to keep the OCR at 1% and that, if necessary, there remains scope for more fiscal and monetary stimulus. CB also maintained a neutral stance despite some calls for an easing bias to be reintroduced. Meanwhile, the Aussie is suffering a similar fate and has given up the 0.6750 level whilst hovering near session lows of 0.6740 thus far (vs. high of 0.6804). Elsewhere, the slide in oil prices has weighed on the Loonie with USD/CAD back above its 100 DMA (1.3260) and approaching the psychological 1.3300 level ahead of its 200 DMA at 1.3302.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Safe havens are poised to end the EU session lower vs the Buck despite the risk aversion in the market as the Dollar reigns over all. USD/JPY has reclaimed 107.50 and printed a current intraday high of 107.68 vs. low of 107.00. USD/CHF meanwhile climbs further north of 0.9850 to a high of 0.9885 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.9896 and the psychological 0.9900 mark.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira remains resilient vs. it’s weakening EM peers, this time amid comments from the CBRT Governor who reiterated the Central Bank’s “cautious” stance, in turn providing some relief to investors who fear that the Bank may be jumping the gun following two back-to-back deeper than forecast rate cuts. The Governor also acknowledged the continuing improvement in inflation whilst also noting an economic recovery in H2. USD/TRY is back below the 5.7000 level (low 5.6784) having declined from an intraday high of 5.7100.</p>",

(-1.0%)</strong> were also negative after US President Trump kept a hawkish tone on China during his UN speech in which he alleged China has not adopted promised reforms, uses heavy state subsidies, steals intellectual property and manipulates its currency. This was later followed by comments from China’s Foreign Minister Wang who responded with a more conciliatory tone in which he suggested the sides need to take their bilateral relationship forward with wisdom as well as conviction and that neither countries can move ahead without the other, although he also added the US should not try to change China and that trade negotiations cannot happen under threats. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the negative risk tone and as the pressure on yields resumed with the 10yr yield below -0.25% and the 5yr yield touched a record low which has spurred speculation BoJ may be forced to reduce is regular purchases, while weaker results at the 40yr JGB auction did little to dent the rally in Japanese bonds.</p><p><strong>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repo</strong> for a net daily drain of CNY 10bln.

Additionally, the possibility of the impeachment of US President Trump adds further uncertainty to the macro backdrop. Further negative ticks were seen across equities (most pronounced in the DAX) on the reports that China is to accelerate the public listings of chip companies on Shanghai’s STAR stock market in the latest initiative by Beijing, as China counter US technology sanctions and speed the development of its semiconductor industry. Sectors are all in the red, with Tech (-2.0%) and Consumer Discretionary (-1.7%) leading the decline, while more defensive Utilities (-1.0%), Health Care (-1.1%) and Consumer Staples (-0.8) are lower but faring better. In terms of individual movers; Adidas (-0.8%) was higher at the open, in sympathy with Nike, who are higher in premarket trade after posting strong earnings, before succumbing to the broader market’s negative feel.

DXY now treads water just above 98.50 ahead of yesterday’s high of around 98.70 with participants keeping an eye on events State-side as the House is to open a formal impeachment inquiry into US President Trump (analysis on the RANsquawk headline feed) whilst Fed’s Evans (Voter, Dove) is due to speak at 1400BST on the economy and policy.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR </strong>- Sterling is on the backfoot today ahead of Parliament’s return at 1130BST (analysis on the RANsquawk headlines) with initial downside in Cable coinciding with reiterations from Labour leader Corbyn, who stated that the earliest he would call a general election would be October 17th after the PM has requested a Brexit extension, although a firmer Buck somewhat influenced currency action. GBP/USD has reversed a bulk of yesterday’s gains with the pair back below the 1.2450 level after breaching its 10 DMA (1.2462) ahead of support between 1.2410-15. Meanwhile, EUR/USD remains around the 1.10 handle (where 740mln in options expire at today’s NY cut) , off its high of around 1.1023 (amid a firmer Buck) ahead of resistance and 1.1025, also where offers have been reported, whilst to the downside, EUR/USD sees resistance at 1.0980.</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD - </strong>The Kiwi has given up most a bulk of its post-RBNZ gains in which the Committee agreed that developments since the August Statement had not significantly changed the outlook for monetary policy. The RBNZ reached a consensus to keep the OCR at 1% and that, if necessary, there remains scope for more fiscal and monetary stimulus. CB also maintained a neutral stance despite some calls for an easing bias to be reintroduced. NZD/USD resides around 0.6325, having visited a high of 0.6350 (on the decision) and vs. a pre-announcement low of 0.6305. Meanwhile, the Aussie has faded yesterday’s Lowe-induced gains with some potential pressure from weaker copper prices and as the AUD/NZD cross falls further below 1.0750 having earlier tested 1.0700 to the downside.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Lira continues to strengthen in European trade, this time amid comments from the CBRT Governor who reiterated the Central Bank’s “cautious” stance, in turn providing some relief to investors who fear that the Bank may be jumping the gun following two back-to-back deeper than forecast rate cuts. The Governor also acknowledged the continuing improvement in inflation whilst also noting an economic recovery in H2. USD/TRY is back below the 5.7000 level (low 5.6784) having declined from an intraday high of 5.7100.</p><p><strong>RBNZ maintained the Official Cash Rate at 1.00% as expected</strong>, while it stated the committee agreed <strong>new information did not warrant significant change to the policy outlook and that a steady OCR is needed</strong> to ensure inflation increases to the mid-point of its target range. RBNZ added there <strong>remains scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus</strong>, that domestic rates can be expected to remain low for longer but also noted that low rates and government spending is expected to support demand in the coming years. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>A more mixed picture across the fixed income complex this morning with European debt posting tentative gains whereas their stateside counterpart is slightly subdued. In terms of European bonds, they are a tad firmer thus far moving in-line with risk sentiment although by a significantly smaller magnitude when compared to the downside we have seen in Dax Dec’19 futures which have lost over 150 points. Drivers in Europe are limited as we haven’t had any Tier 1 data or notable Central Bank remarks, as such Bunds are capped by the 175.0 level with little/no price action derived from today’s 10-year supply. Gilts are leading the way having surpassed the 134.0 mark and breached a few technical boundaries but remain capped by the psychological 134.50 figure thus far. UK assets may well see some additional volatility from 11:30 BST onwards as the House of Commons reopens following yesterday’s court ruling; with the PM due to address the Commons today. Turning to USTs, which are modestly softer though are little changed and somewhat tentative as impeachment talk ratchets up overnight with Speaker Pelosi having instigated formal proceedings; currently, the curve is little changed, though the 2/10 spread has widened a tad. For reference, a analysis piece on the process of impeachment is available on the RANsquawk headline feed. Looking ahead in the US session, aside from any updates to impeachment, we have a number of Central Bank speaker scheduled alongside the next wave of US supply in the form of a USD 41bln 5-year auction.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The crude complex is lower on Wednesday morning, seemingly in line with equities, although bearish supply side news doing the rounds is also likely a factor in the downside; reportedly, Saudi Aramco is recovering faster than expected form the recent attacks on its oil facilities, with total daily production capacity likely to be restored to over 11mln BPD roughly one week ahead of schedule. On the topic of bearish impulses; more reports focusing on the fact that the US drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs) count is declining, possibly an indication that companies have started completing unfinished wells, which could foreshadow elevated US crude output, have been doing the rounds. Elsewhere, the complex has taken little impetus from geopolitics; Iranian President Rouhani has indicated a willingness to make some concession if the US eases sanctions (which remains a big if, especially given US President Trump’s slightly hawkish UNGA speech yesterday), and may unveil some proposals at the UN later today.<strong> WTI </strong>futures are again below the USD 56.50/bbl mark, consolidating for now around USD 56.50/bbl figure, meanwhile <strong>Brent</strong> remains near the USD 62/bbl level. <strong>Spot Gold</strong> futures are fairly flat, seemingly unable to take advantage of woes in the equity market, and is blanketed by support and resistance at USD 1520/oz and USD 1536/oz respectively. Elsewhere, copper is lower, in line with general sentiment.</p><p><strong>API Crude Inventories: +1.4mln vs. Exp. -0.2mln (Prev. +0.6mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Saudi Aramco have restored oil production capacity to 11.3mln bpd</strong>, according to multiple sources.

On the topic of bearish impulses; more reports focusing on the fact that the US drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs) count is declining, possibly an indication that companies have started completing unfinished wells, which could foreshadow elevated US crude output, have been doing the rounds. Elsewhere, the complex has taken little impetus from geopolitics; Iranian President Rouhani has indicated a willingness to make some concession if the US eases sanctions (which remains a big if, especially given US President Trump’s slightly hawkish UNGA speech yesterday), and may unveil some proposals at the UN later today. WTI futures are again below the USD 56.50/bbl mark, consolidating for now around USD 56.50/bbl figure, meanwhile Brent remains near the USD 62/bbl level. Spot Gold futures are fairly flat, seemingly unable to take advantage of woes in the equity market, and is blanketed by support and resistance at USD 1520/oz and USD 1536/oz respectively. Elsewhere, copper is lower, in line with general sentiment.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THE LATEST: </strong>The SCOTUK has ruled to void UK PM Johnson’s 9 September suspension of parliament as unlawful and, as such, prorogation is now void. MP’s will return to parliament today, taking their seats in the HoC at 11.30 BST. Before the since voided period of prorogation began, anti-no deal MPs managed to pass a piece of legislation, called the Benn bill, that forces the government to ask the EU for an extension if a deal between the UK and EU has not been signed by 19 October. Given that Johnson has pledged to deliver Brexit deal or no deal by 31 October, in contradiction of the Benn Bill (which is now the law), there are a number of possible outcomes to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENN BILL: </strong>Firstly, if UK PM Johnson deems he cannot ask the EU for an extension, given his previous pledges not to and also because he does not want to break the law, he could choose to resign. Since the SCOTUK ruling yesterday, he has faced calls from the opposition to resign for “acting unlawfully”, although has remained defiant thus far. Secondly, the government could ignore the Benn Bill, and if they fail to secure a deal at the EC Summit on 17-18 October, not request an extension to the Brexit deadline. This would likely lead to another legal challenge in the SCOTUK, where it is likely the government would be found to have acted unlawfully again. However, given that after the EC Summit, the official 31 October Brexit date will be fast approaching, the government choosing this option is likely to increase the perceived probability of a no deal exit, whether by accident or by the government’s intention, as those seeking to prevent a no deal would need to act quickly in securing an extension from the EU. Finally, the government could choose to comply with the Benn Bill, and request an extension from Brussels. The market’s base case appears to be that the EU would grant the UK a further A50 extension, however, there is a tail risk that the EU refuse. In recent weeks, some EU leaders, in particular the French, have been particularly vocal in saying that they do not want to grant an extension unless there is a specific reason for such it (i.e. a general election or another Brexit referendum) so there is always a risk that the EU deem the UK’s reasoning for asking for an extension does not meet this criteria. However, with UK opposition parties pledging there support for a potential GE once an extension is secured, this outcome seems unlikely. Moreover, there have been talks about UK Brexiteers possibly allying with anti-EU EU leaders (such as Hungary PM Orban) and pushing for them to veto any UK request for an extension. Conversely, the UK itself could veto the decision, as all EU28 would have a veto.</p><p><strong>VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE:</strong> At any point the opposition could call for a vote of no confidence in the government. Opposition leader Corbyn has previously pledged to call a VONC “at the time of his choosing”, and since the SCOTUK decision yesterday, more opposition parties have been calling for a vote. If a VONC is called and the government wins, then little changes, however with the government’s majority currently running in the minus 40s, this seems unlikely. If the government loses, which is likely the market’s base case, then an alternative government could be formed. There have been talks about the formation of a government of national unity being formed, headed by opposition leader Corbyn, whose purpose would be to secure an extension from the EU and then head to a general election. However, Corbyn’s lack of popularity amongst other opposition parties, particularly the Liberal Democrats and Scotland’s SNP leaves this outcome unlikely. Failing the formation of a new government in 14 days, there could be a general election. As noted above, opposition leaders are unlikely to agree call for a VONC until they are “sure” that UK PM Johnson will abide by the law and request an extension from the EU if the two sides fail to reach a deal.</p><p><strong>POTENTIAL DEAL WITH EU:</strong> UK PM Johnson continues to pledge that his number one priority is to find a deal with the EU. Although there has been some movement on the EU’s side, from “the current withdrawal agreement is the only possible deal” to “we will consider proposals that meet the objectives of the backstop”, the EU maintains that proposals from the UK so far remain insufficient. For Johnson (and the Conservatives), the best outcome is to find a deal; if he fails, he will face the difficult choices discussed above, resign, ask for an extension or break the law. If Johnson asks for an extension, the Conservatives risk taking a hit in the polls right before a general election (Brexit voters are likely to be angered if Johnson does not stick to his do or die pledge to deliver Brexit by October end). As such, Johnson is likely to continue to push for a deal until the EC Summit on 17-18 Oct. If a deal is reached with the EU, it will need to pass parliament. This will likely depend on the content of the deal, i.e. the concessions made by the EU on the previous withdrawal agreement’s main sticking point, the backstop. It remains unclear how such a deal would face in parliament. Opposition leaders would likely whip MPs to strike it down, but there are suggestions a group of up to 20 Labour MPs may back a deal. Moreover, Conservative Brexiteers may also defy party whips, seeing EU concessions as insufficient.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Currently</strong></p><ul><li>House Speaker Pelosi has stated the House is to open a formal impeachment inquiry into US President Trump. The impeachment proceedings are due to the President having seriously violated the Constitution; regarding allegations that US President Trump has reportedly pressured Ukraine President Zelensky to investigate former US VP Joe Biden, who is also a 2020 Presidential candidate.</li></ul><p><strong>Road-map ahead:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Investigation:</strong></p><ul><li>Speaker Pelosi has instructed the six House committees to proceed under the ‘umbrella’ of a formal enquiry, the six committees are; Judiciary, Intelligence, Ways &amp; Means, Financial Services, Oversight and Foreign Affairs. The committees had already been investigating the President, but the instigation of formal proceedings should, in theory, compel the necessary officials to cooperate with the investigation.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;House Vote:</strong></p><ul><li>For the proceedings to pass through the House of Representatives, the six committees’ investigations must first pass a referral vote from the Judiciary Committee. Subsequently, if approved, the articles would then be passed to the full House. At this point a simple majority is required.</li><li>Currently within the House of Representatives there are 435 members composed of 235 Democrats, 198 Republicans, one Independent and one vacancy. As such, a simple majority of 218 members is required. Currently, 154 members of the Democratic Caucus are in favour of impeachment, therefore an additional 64 House Representatives are required.</li><li>If the proceedings attain a simple majority then, unless the President resigns, it is raised to the Senate.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Senate:</strong></p><ul><li>Within the Senate there are currently 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two Independents. For the impeachment proceedings to pass through the Senate a 2/3 majority (67) is necessary. Typically, following the House vote there is a Senate trial. However, given the clear Republican majority it is unclear as to whether such a trial would take place.</li></ul><p><strong>Notable points:</strong></p><ul><li>The House of Representatives begins a two-week recess after this week, which will evidently delay proceedings and possibly remove some of the urgency around it.</li><li>The handing over of the ‘Whistle Blower Report’ by the White House may serve as an alternative route for Democrats. Trump has announced he will release the transcript of the phone call with the Ukrainian President; but as of yet no further indication has been given regarding the whistle blower report.</li></ul>",

Today’s bid was inspired by weak consumer confidence data, while the slide in risk assets also contributed Trump stuck to the script at the UN, but revealed no signs of thawing on China or Iran, while the NY Fed’s repo operations – both the 14-day and the overnight operation – were oversubscribed, hinting that liquidity conditions in money markets might not be a temporary phenomenon, and possibly reflects some other underlying tensions other than the temporary factors cited last week (last week, the crunch in money markets was attributed to corporate tax paying and digesting Treasury issuance). The Treasury’s sale of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through the screens by 1bps.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets tracked the losses seen across global peers amid headwinds from the US where sentiment was dragged by weak Consumer Confidence data, increasing impeachment concerns and after President Trump kept a hardline tone on China and Iran. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were lower with Australia pressured by losses in the mining-related sectors and after optimistic comments on the economy from Governor Lowe placed some doubts regarding a rate cut next week, while Japan trade was dampened by recent flows into its currency and ongoing uncertainty regarding a trade deal with the US. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) were also negative after US President Trump kept a hawkish tone on China during his UN speech in which he alleged China has not adopted promised reforms, uses heavy state subsidies, steals intellectual property and manipulates its currency. This was later followed by comments from China’s Foreign Minister Wang who responded with a more conciliatory tone in which he suggested the sides need to take their bilateral relationship forward with wisdom as well as conviction and that neither countries can move ahead without the other, although he also added the US should not try to change China and that trade negotiations cannot happen under threats. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the negative risk tone and as the pressure on yields resumed with the 10yr yield below -0.25% and the 5yr yield touched a record low which has spurred speculation BoJ may be forced to reduce is regular purchases, while weaker results at the 40yr JGB auction did little to dent the rally in Japanese bonds.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets track the losses seen across global peers amid headwinds from the US where sentiment was dragged by weak Consumer Confidence data, increasing impeachment concerns and after President Trump kept a hardline tone on China and Iran. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are lower with Australia pressured by losses in the mining-related sectors and after optimistic comments on the economy from Governor Lowe placed some doubts regarding a rate cut next week, while Japan trade is dampened by recent flows into its currency and ongoing uncertainty regarding a trade deal with US. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are also negative after US President Trump kept a hawkish tone on China during his UN speech in which he alleged China has not adopted promised reforms, uses heavy state subsidies, steals intellectual property and manipulates its currency. This was later followed by comments from China’s Foreign Minister Wang who responded with a more conciliatory tone in which he suggested the sides need to take their bilateral relationship forward with wisdom as well as conviction and that neither countries can move ahead without the other, although he also added the US should not try to change China and that trade negotiations cannot happen under threats.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer overnight and eyes the 98.50 level as its recovers some of the prior day’s lost ground against its major counterparts after EUR/USD reclaimed the 1.1000 handle to the upside which it now struggles to hold on to, while GBP/USD also gave back some of the gains seen from the Supreme Court ruling that PM Johnson's prorogation of parliament was unlawful and void, as resistance at 1.2500 stalled the advances in the pair. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was subdued by the risk averse tone but is off worst levels after having rebounded from support at 107.00 and antipodeans are resilient with AUD/USD remaining afloat after RBA Governor Lowe suggested fundamental factors remain strong and that the economy is at a gentle turning point, and although he reiterated the Board is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed, he stopped short of signalling an imminent rate cut. NZD/USD was also boosted after the RBNZ kept rates unchanged as expected and provided a neutral tone as they kept the door open for future action but also noted that a steady OCR is needed to ensure inflation increases to mid-point of target range.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the negative risk tone and as the pressure on yields resumed with the 10yr yield below -0.25% and the 5yr yield touched a record low which has spurred speculation BoJ may be forced to reduce is regular purchases, while participants also await a 40yr auction later.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The RBNZ will announce its latest rate decision on Wednesday in which the central bank is expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.00% with a major newswire poll showing unanimous forecasts for the RBNZ to pause on rates, while markets are pricing in 69% probability for no change in the OCR and 31% chance for a 25bps cut.</p><p>The wide expectations for the RBNZ to stand pat follow the central bank's recent actions as it had just over-delivered with a surprise 50bps cut at the last meeting, which was double the magnitude of what markets had anticipated and was to ensure the RBNZ reaches its employment and inflation objectives. This proximity to the RBNZ’s recent aggressive action is seen as likely to keep the central bank from further immediate reductions and Governor Orr also stated they can afford to wait and observe, while he added that they will see what the situation is like in November and will cut if necessary, which therefore suggests a September move is likely off the cards. Nonetheless, future easing is seen to be very much in play as Governor Orr noted that the recent cut does not rule out any future action and that the MPC have become convinced doing more sooner was better to achieve its targets.</p><p>Other top officials also anticipate further policy adjustments as Deputy Governor Bascand suggested there is some probability for another rate cut and Assistant Governor Hawkesby noted the outlook for rates is more balanced after the 50bps cut, but added there is still some probability the OCR will need to be reduced further. In addition, there has been increased rhetoric from the RBNZ regarding unconventional tools which Hawkesby stated are a contingency in the event inflation tanks although conventional policy tools would need to be exhausted first, while Governor Orr also touched upon the possibility of using negative interest rates but added the recent cut reduces the risk to use such measures.</p><p>The latest data releases have been mixed as New Zealand growth figures topped estimates for Q2 with GDP Q/Q at 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.6%) and GDP Y/Y at 2.1% vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 2.5%). However, this still showed a slowdown from Q1, while Business Outlook continued to deteriorate in August to -52.3 (Prev. -44.3) and Manufacturing PMI also slipped into contraction territory at 48.2 (Prev. 51.3). These varied releases therefore support the case for the RBNZ to stand pat and wait for further signs from the economy.</p><p>The rate announcement is scheduled for 0300BST/2100CDT/1000HKT where the main focus will be on the actual announcement, before shifting to the accompanying statement for any clues if the bank is leaning towards another reduction at the November meeting which will be the last for 2019, with any dovish hints likely to pressure NZD/USD. As a reminder, the upcoming decision will not be followed by a press conference which further adds to the likelihood for no policy adjustment.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\"></figure><p>Recent Comments and Calls</p><ul><li>ANZ Bank sees no change today but expects rates to be cut to as low as 0.25% by May 2020.</li><li>New Zealand Shadow Board recommends no change at the upcoming RBNZ policy review.</li><li>UBS sees RBNZ cutting cash rate to 0.5% in February 2020.</li></ul>",
