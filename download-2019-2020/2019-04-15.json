        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities flat, dollar flat, Treasuries down, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> China mulling shifting agricultural tariffs; Fed’s Evans toes neutral line; bank earnings mixed.</p><p><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>UK Employment Data; German &amp; EU ZEW Economic Sentiment; US Industrial Production &amp; Manufacturing Output; New Zealand CPI; Fed Discount Rate Minutes; Fed’s Rosengren &amp; Kaplan Speaking; Supply from Japan &amp; UK; Earnings from: IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Netflix, UnitedHealth Group, CSX, Bank of America, BlackRock</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The main development on Monday out of the US-China trade front was that that China is reportedly looking at shifting tariffs from US agricultural goods onto other products, a move that would gain political points for US President Trump, where he can frame the shift as a win for US farmers. On the US-EU front, it was reported that EU members have agreed to begin trade negotiations with the US, This followed source reports on Thursday that European governments had struck an agreement on the bloc's negotiating mandate ahead of formal trade talks with the US.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s Evans (voter, neutral) </strong>said on Monday morning that US data has strengthened over the last few weeks and the economy is solid; he can envisage a scenario where the Fed fund rate is to be flat/unchanged through Fall of 2020. However, later comments revealed that he sees risks from downside scenarios looming larger than those from the upside, and the most recent data on the US economy has been on the soft side. when questioned if a cut was on the Fed’s agenda, he said there would have to be a negative shock for it to be considered, but he did later say that a cut is a scenario he sees in order to support inflation although that is not his base case. Evans said that the December rate hike was not a mistake and is comfortable with current monetary policy settings, emphasising that the Fed can be data dependent until pressures lead to inflation; and on that subject, the Chicago Fed President said it is currently weaker than he would like to see, which concerns him, and that he would be willing for inflation to rise up to 2.5% provided that there was a path for it to be managed back down closer to 2%.</p><p><strong>* BOC BUSINESS OUTLOOK SURVEY:</strong> The release was judged to be neutral/dovish, confirming the softness in growth metrics. ”The results are broadly consistent with our expectation for a prolonged policy hold at least through to the end of the year in anticipation of a rebound in domestic growth and improved global risks.” The main takeaways, Scotia said, are that Canadian businesses are not even remotely in the camp of expecting a US recession and see sales growth modestly improving through the course of next year. “Nevertheless, their investment and hiring intentions softened but point to expansion, and they suddenly indicate much less capacity pressure overall and through labour shortages, I personally view with a lot of suspicion.” Scotia notes “The advantage to this survey is that it can provide fairly timely anecdotes and intentions to inform growth tracking and forecasts. The disadvantage is that its usefulness as a forward looking gauge is limited by its tendency to be a reactionary and contemporaneous signal of developments.”</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES $0.49 LOWER AT $63.40/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES $0.37 LOWER AT $71.18/BBL. </strong>The crude complex pared some of last weeks gains on Monday, but remained within range from the YTD highs. Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh on the weekend said&nbsp; the oil market is fragile due to US pressures on Iran and Venezuela, and tensions in Libya; “He may be talking his book, but these are important elements in the bullish price scenario,” analysts at Citigroup added. On a more technical front, Reuters energy analyst John Kemp notes that fund managers have continued to add to their long positions in the recent week, “the market is starting to look stretched and the balance of risks is shifting to the downside”, with the aggregate long positions outnumbering the short positions by a ratio of 7:1; commenting on the shift from net short to net long positioning in the YTD period, “By April, however, the concentrated long positioning started to signal a likely reversal in the rally, or at least a pause, if fund managers attempt to take some profits.” Following last week’s bipolar US crude inventory report, with the large crude build being offset by a greater magnitude draw in gasoline stocks, this week’s estimates see crude building 1.9mln bbls, gasoline stocks drawing 2.4mln bbls, and distillates drawing 0.9mln bbls; Genscape forecasts Cushing, Oklahoma, drawing 2mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.1% at 2906, NDX +0.0% at 7629, DJI -0.1% at 26384. SECTORS: Communications +0.4%, Cons Discretionary +0.2%, Cons Staples +0.7%, Energy -0.6%, Financials -0.6%, Healthcare +0.4%, Industrials -0.5%, Materials -0.5%, Tech +0.0%, Telecoms +0.2%, Utilities +0.0%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Goldman Sachs (GS) shares traded lower after the investment bank reported lower than expected revenues. Boeing (BA) shares fall after brand consultancy firm said negative publicity regarding the 737 groundings could cost the brand up to USD 12bln. Citigroup (C) shares fell after the bank reported mixed first-quarter results, where EPS came in above expectations but overall revenues came in below. United Airlines (UAL) shares fell after the airline announced that it had joined American Airlines in further grounding Boeing’s (BA) 737 Max, saying it wants to wait until independent regulators have deemed the aircraft safe. Alliance Data Systems (ADS) shares dropped on valuations concerns regarding the data co.’s Epsilon unit which it is selling to Publicis Groupe for USD 4.4bln. Advanced Disposal Services (ADSW) shares soared on reports that Waste Management Inc. (WM) had offered to buy the firm for roughly USD 3bln. Spotify Technology (SPOT) shares fell after reports emerged that Amazon (AMZN) was to launch a music streaming service. Levi Strauss &amp; Co (LEVI) shares traded higher off the back of upgrades from JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-05. </strong>Yields started the week off higher on US/China trade deal optimism, but the rise was modest and after testing fresh 3.5 week highs, in quiet conditions in a holiday-shortened week, yields drifted lower for the TPLEX to finish slightly higher by settle.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The Buck is mixed, trading around neutral as we head into the APAC session, after a quiet-ish session, where yields saw only limited action, and the SPX was mostly stuck within a tight range. The Loonie weakened by around half a point, while 2yr yields dropped 3bps after a neutral/dovish BOC Business Outlook Survey. While lawmakers are on holiday, GBP had a Brexit-free session, leaving traders to focus on the technical, though action was gravitating around 1.31, where chunky GBP 1.39bln expiry rolls off at Tuesday’s NY cut. Similarly, there wasn’t any A-List data on the European docket, leaving EUR straddling 1.13 unchanged levels. JPY was also quiet around the 112.00 mark, mostly ignoring dovish Kuroda comments (that were recorded on Saturday, and aired on CNBC in the US morning). AUD was also uneventful, with traders eyeing the jobs data out later in the week. EMFX was weaker against the buck.</p>",

On a more technical front, Reuters energy analyst John Kemp notes that fund managers have continued to add to their long positions in the recent week, “the market is starting to look stretched and the balance of risks is shifting to the downside”, with the aggregate long positions outnumbering the short positions by a ratio of 7:1; commenting on the shift from net short to net long positioning in the YTD period, “By April, however, the concentrated long positioning started to signal a likely reversal in the rally, or at least a pause, if fund managers attempt to take some profits.” Following last week’s bipolar US crude inventory report, with the large crude build being offset by a greater magnitude draw in gasoline stocks, this week’s estimates see crude building 1.9mln bbls, gasoline stocks drawing 2.4mln bbls, and distillates drawing 0.9mln bbls; Genscape forecasts Cushing, Oklahoma, drawing 2mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound appears to be revelling in the relative lack of Brexit-related headlines during the UK Parliament recess, or at least relieved with the break from almost constant Whitehall media coverage. However, low level talks between the Tories and Labour are ongoing over Easter and are said to have been more in-depth and positive than anticipated thus far, according to Foreign Secretary Hunt. Cable is inching above 1.3100 and closer to near term resistance in the form of last Friday’s 1.3132 peak and the 30 DMA, while Eur/Gbp has slipped back from near 0.8650 highs towards 0.8520 even though the single currency is holding firm vs the Dollar and other G10 counterparts.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie crept up on the blindside and largely shrugged off weaker crude and poor Canadian existing home sales to probe back above 1.3300 vs its US peer. However, gains were erased and more to a fresh low circa 1.3390 on the back of the BoC’s Spring Business Outlook Survey as the headline index turned a tad negative and the snapshot is for a moderation from high levels of domestic and foreign demand across most regions, albeit with investment and employment intentions still positive. Back to Usd/Cad, last week’s high was 1.3396 and then 1.3400 will be a round number target.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/NZD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The Euro has lost some of its early momentum vs the Buck and across the board as Eur/Usd stalled ahead of resistance at 1.1324 and 1.1341 (Fib and 200 WMA respectively). However, the headline pair remains technically firm if not outright bullish while above another Fib level at 1.1284 and as long as the Usd does not continue to rebound in wake of an upbeat NY Fed manufacturing survey. On that note, the <strong>DXY</strong> has pared losses from 96.780 to retest the top of Monday’s range so far (96.937), but not quite 97.000 and it remains to be seen whether it can close above the 30 DMA (96.891). Meanwhile, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are off best levels within 0.7182-64 and 0.6782-56 respective parameters, but the Aussie in particular remains underpinned as Aud/Nzd crosses 1.0600 amidst positive reports surrounding US-China trade (former said to have relaxed industrial subsidy demands and latter reportedly mulling whether to shift agricultural tariffs in response to a request by Washington). Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy is pivoting 112.00 and its ytd high vs 200 WMA (112.14-111.98), with BoJ Governor Kuroda blaming weak wage growth for the lack of overall inflation, adding that it remains possible to lower long term and rates in general if requited, while Usd/Chf is hugging higher ground between 1.0010-39, like Eur/Chf within a 1.1325-46 band.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira continues underperform and inch closer to recent lows vs the Greenback on domestic politics, diplomatic strains and more disappointing Turkish data (as jobless rate and budget balance both deteriorated). Moreover, some reports about an investment meeting at the IMF/World Bank over the weekend have been far from encouraging with Usd/Try currently hovering near 5.8000.</p>",

The bank points to soft data (PMI and CFIB) which hint at some cooling in activity. However, BOC governor Poloz in a recent speech said that firms were accelerating their investment plans following government rule changes last year, and therefore,<strong> RBC argues that investment intentions may hold up well, while other survey questions around slack and sales growth may be softer.</strong> \"Inflation expectations have been in the upper end of the BOC's 1-3% range for the past four quarters, but that looks more tied to actual inflation and could fall this time, the bank says, in line with the actual inflation data. <strong>The bank also reminds us that, as usual, the BOC's qualitative commentary will be as important as the survey numbers.&nbsp;</strong></p>",

Expected to rise to 85c/shr in Q2. The 2018 capital plan was conditioned on GS not returning more than USD 6.3bln of capital between Q3 2018 to Q2 2019; the plan had an authorisation to repurchase USD 5bln of common stock and USD 1.3bln of common stock dividends. Barclays says the repurchase plan remains within the range of expectations GS laid out in April 2018, but while it repurchased around 50% of this figure in 2H 2019; analysts are watching if GS can maintain dividends in the face of increased litigation from the 1MDB scandal.</li><li><strong>BUSINESS REVIEW:</strong> Management is conducting a comprehensive business review of all divisions. Later in the year, this review will be used to provide company financial targets. Updates on this will be eyed.</li><li><strong>REVENUE INITIATIVE:</strong> The USD 5bln revenue boost initiative announced in 2017 to improve its financial health, and aimed to be achieved by 2020. The USD 5bln is seen coming from opportunities in FICC (USD 1bln+), lending and financing (USD 2bln+), investment banking (USD 0.5bln+), investment management (USD 1bln+), and equities (USD 0.5bln+).</li><li><strong>PREVIOUS EARNINGS REPORT (Q4 2018, released 16 Jan): </strong>GS Q4 2018 earnings beat was driven by lower than expected tax rate, better than expected advisory fees, cost control measures (expenses -2% Y/Y) offsetting weaker than expected capital markets numbers (FICC -18% Y/Y on the back of lower net revenues in credit and rate products, equities +17% Y/Y on an 80% increase in equities client execution revenues). Investors were encouraged that share repurchases continued despite charges around the 1MDB scandal (net litigation provisions rose to USD 516mln for Q4, and were USD 844mln for the FY 18). It was David Solomon's first earnings report as GS CEO, and investors were encouraged by his performance.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Source: Barclays, RANsquawk, RBC, Refinitiv, Zacks.</strong></i></p><p><strong>NOTE: RANsquawk is trialling this new format for US earnings previews and would welcome your feedback.

(Newswires)</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p>Asian equity markets began the week mostly positive as the region took impetus from last Friday’s gains on Wall St. where sentiment was underpinned by a strong start to earnings season and encouraging Chinese data. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (U/C) was dampened amid tentativeness ahead of key earnings and underperformance in gold miners, as well as trade-related news including a further decline of Chinese imports and dispute at the WTO on Australia's restriction on Chinese 5G technology. The rest of the major Asia-Pac indices are mixed as recent advances in USD/JPY fuelled the upside in Nikkei 225 (+1.4%), while Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) finished lower but were initially boosted as most of the recent Chinese data surpassed estimates including New Yuan Loans, Aggregate Financing, Trade Balance and Exports with the latter at a 5-month high. Furthermore, reports the US softened its demands on China for reducing state industrial subsidies and that both sides have agreed to measures to avoid China currency manipulation, added to the hopes for a looming trade deal. Finally, 10yr JGBs were softer as they tracked the recent losses in T-notes and with demand also dampened by gains in riskier assets as well as a lack of BoJ presence in the market today.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Twitter)</p><p>UK Foreign Secretary Hunt states that Brexit talks with the Labour Party are more in-depth and constructive than people expected. Prior to this, UK Cabinet Office Minister Lidington said would like government and Labour to agree on a binding mechanism for a way forward, while he added there is still a possibility for customs union compromises and that the government remains against a second referendum. Lidington adds that the two sides would ‘take stock’ in 10 days and that the process could not drag out.

In Europe, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.5%) bodes well as the bourse hit eight-month highs, bolstered by banking names amidst the optimism surrounding US banks’ earnings (ahead of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup earnings today). As such the banking sector in Europe outperforms (Stoxx 600 Banks +0.9%) whilst its peers remain mixed. In terms of individual movers, France’s Publicis Groupe (+3.2%) leads the gains in the CAC 40 (+0.1%) on the back of an optimistic revenue update, whilst also supporting its UK peer WPP (+1.3%) in tandem. Elsewhere, Covestro (-4.2%) is the marked laggard in the DAX (Unch) amid ex-dividend trade. Finally, IWG (+22.4%) rests at the top of the Stoxx 600 [Unch] after reports that Japan’s TKP are to acquire the Co.’s workspace leading unit for JPY 50bln coupled with a broker upgrade.</p><p>FX</p><p>GBP - Sterling remains underpinned and relatively optimistic after another Article 50 extension to avoid a no deal Brexit and amidst reports that talks between the Conservative and Labour Parties have been more detailed and constructive than some expected, per UK Foreign Secretary Hunt. Cable is eyeing 1.3100 again, albeit with a hefty helping hand from a broadly soft Dollar, as Eur/Gbp trades largely sideways within a 0.8633-50 range. Technically, 1.3132 (last Friday’s high) forms nearest resistance, but data could become pivotal as the week unfolds given jobs and earnings on tap tomorrow, then CPI on Wednesday and retail sales ahead of the long Easter break.</p><p>EUR - As noted above, the single currency is also firm and outperforming the Greenback as the DXY slips a bit further below 97.000 to just under 96.800. Eur/Usd is inching towards 1.1300+ upside chart levels, like a 50% Fib circa 1.1324 and the 200 WMA around 1.1341. Note also, 2 banks are long of the headline pair and looking for sizeable rallies to 1.1650 and even 1.1800.</p><p>NZD/AUD/JPY/CHF/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Usd with the Kiwi and Aussie both deriving some support from reports overnight suggesting the US has relaxed some demands over Chinese industrial subsidies in ongoing trade negotiations, as Nzd/Usd hovers between 0.6763-82 and Aud/Usd in a 0.7164-80 range. However, Usd/Jpy has not advanced as much as risk-on sentiment might have suggested overnight with the pair fading just shy of the 2019 peak (112.14) amidst supply from Japanese exporters according to market contacts and now revisiting the 200 WMA (111.98). Meanwhile, the Franc is sitting tight within 1.0010-28 parameters and Loonie between 1.3320-47 ahead of the BoC’s Business Outlook Survey and against the backdrop of softer oil prices that are also undermining the NOK (sub-9.6100 vs the Eur as SEK holds above 10.4700).</p><p>EM - The Try has been hit hard again and got closer to recent lows vs the Usd in wake of latest Turkish jobs data revealing a spike in the rolling 3 month average unemployment rate to 14.7% vs 13.5% previously. The Lira has nursed some losses since on the aforementioned Buck weakness, but remains on the backfoot in a 5.7600-8115 band in stark contrast to the Rand that has extended gains through 14.0000 even though one institution is anticipating a reversal in the Zar’s fortunes and rebound to 14.2700.</p><p>SNB Chairman Jordan said he sees no reason to alter monetary policy but added that they are still willing to intervene if required. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The psychological 127.00 level is still capping 10yr Gilt futures with the UK benchmark extending its retreat from Liffe highs just under the aforementioned big figure (126.99) and slipping to a low of 126.69 at worst. The pull-back saw continuation trend support at 126.76 briefly breached, as positive risk sentiment pressures fixed income, and with stops noted next on the downside at 126.43. Core Eurozone debt is also hanging near lows of the day, with the German 10 yr another victim of the Chinese data driven downturn, and 164.32 highlighted as a key support level should more constructive US-China trade vibes emerge through the session.</p><p>Turning to the States, bonds and price movement has been relatively uneventful, with contracts essentially at the same level they closed at on Friday across the curve even though activity in 10 yr put options has been fairly substantial (several big blocks going through in May19 and Jun19 expiries). Ahead, traders will be keeping an eye on potential comments from Fed’s Evans for direction on a slow start to the week with only NY Fed manufacturing on the docket.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Subdued trade in the energy complex as WTI (-0.8%) and Brent (-0.8%) futures gave up some of Friday’s gains, with the latter now straddling around the psychological USD 71.00/bbl level. Friday’s CFTC data showed that hedge funds raise bullish ICE WTI crude bets by 30.7k to 281.7k lots, whilst speculators increased net long positions in Brent crude (for a fifth consecutive week) by almost 9.5k to just over 358k in the week to April 9th. Over the weekend, Russia’s Finance Minister stated that OPEC+ could decide to raise production (at the June 25/26 meeting) to fight for market share with the US. Currently OPEC+ have agreed to curb output by 1.2mln BPD until June 2019, with IFX noting that Russia’s April production fell by 150k BPD vs the benchmark October level. Back in December, Russia committed to reducing output by 228k BPD from October levels of 11.4mln BPD in a gradual manner which would take place over several months.</p><p>Elsewhere, the precious metals sector is mostly in the red with gold (-0.4%) edging lower and breaching its 100 DMA (USD 1288/oz) to the downside as last week’s Chinese data somewhat eases fears of a global growth slowdown. Meanwhile, copper (-0.3%) gave up its overnight gains as the risk sentiment became more cautious during early EU trade. Finally, Shanghai steel futures hit a seven-and-a-half year high as the alloy is supported by firm demand, whilst its base metal, Dalian iron ore futures remained near record highs on dwindling Chinese stockpiles which declined the most since 2015, according to SteelHome data.</p><p>Platts Associate Director Hickin sees Brent crude averaging close to USD 70/bbl this year, according to Business Standard.

In Europe, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.5%) bodes well as the bourse hit eight-month highs, bolstered by banking names amidst the optimism surrounding US banks’ earnings (ahead of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup earnings today). As such the banking sector in Europe outperforms (Stoxx 600 Banks +0.8%) whilst its peers remain mixed. In terms of individual movers, France’s Publicis Groupe (+3.7%) leads the gains in the CAC 40 (+0.1%) on the back of an optimistic revenue update, whilst also supporting its UK peer WPP (+1.0%) in tandem. Elsewhere, Covestro (-4.7) is the marked laggard in the DAX (Unch) amid ex-dividend trade. Finally, IWG (+17.6%) rests at the top of the Stoxx 600 [Unch] after reports that Japan’s TKP are to acquire the Co.’s workspace leading unit for JPY 50bln coupled with a broker upgrade.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - Sterling remains underpinned and relatively optimistic after another Article 50 extension to avoid a no deal Brexit and amidst reports that talks between the Conservative and Labour Parties have been more detailed and constructive than some expected, per UK Foreign Secretary Hunt. Cable is eyeing 1.3100 again, albeit with a hefty helping hand from a broadly soft Dollar, as Eur/Gbp trades largely sideways within a 0.8633-50 range. Technically, 1.3132 (last Friday’s high) forms nearest resistance, but data could become pivotal as the week unfolds given jobs and earnings on tap tomorrow, then CPI on Wednesday and retail sales ahead of the long Easter break.</p><p>EUR - As noted above, the single currency is also firm and outperforming the Greenback as the DXY slips a bit further below 97.000 to just under 96.800. Eur/Usd is inching towards 1.1300+ upside chart levels, like a 50% Fib circa 1.1324 and the 200 WMA around 1.1341. Note also, 2 banks are long of the headline pair and looking for sizeable rallies to 1.1650 and even 1.1800.</p><p>NZD/AUD/JPY/CHF/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Usd with the Kiwi and Aussie both deriving some support from reports overnight suggesting the US has relaxed some demands over Chinese industrial subsidies in ongoing trade negotiations, as Nzd/Usd hovers between 0.6763-82 and Aud/Usd in a 0.7164-80 range. However, Usd/Jpy has not advanced as much as risk-on sentiment might have suggested overnight with the pair fading just shy of the 2019 peak (112.14) amidst supply from Japanese exporters according to market contacts and now revisiting the 200 WMA (111.98). Meanwhile, the Franc is sitting tight within 1.0010-28 parameters and Loonie between 1.3320-47 ahead of the BoC’s Business Outlook Survey and against the backdrop of softer oil prices that are also undermining the NOK (sub-9.6100 vs the Eur as SEK holds above 10.4700).</p><p>EM - The Try has been hit hard again and got closer to recent lows vs the Usd in wake of latest Turkish jobs data revealing a spike in the rolling 3 month average unemployment rate to 14.7% vs 13.5% previously. The Lira has nursed some losses since on the aforementioned Buck weakness, but remains on the backfoot in a 5.7600-8115 band in stark contrast to the Rand that has extended gains through 14.0000 even though one institution is anticipating a reversal in the Zar’s fortunes and rebound to 14.2700.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>The psychological 127.00 level is still capping 10yr Gilt futures with the UK benchmark extending its retreat from Liffe highs just under the aforementioned big figure (126.99) and slipping to a low of 126.69 at worst. The pull-back saw continuation trend support at 126.76 briefly breached, as positive risk sentiment pressures fixed income, and with stops noted next on the downside at 126.43. Core Eurozone debt is also hanging near lows of the day, with the German 10 yr another victim of the Chinese data driven downturn, and 164.32 highlighted as a key support level should more constructive US-China trade vibes emerge through the session.</p><p>Turning to the States, bonds and price movement has been relatively uneventful, with contracts essentially at the same level they closed at on Friday across the curve even though activity in 10 yr put options has been fairly substantial (several big blocks going through in May19 and Jun19 expiries). Ahead, traders will be keeping an eye on potential comments from Fed’s Evans for direction on a slow start to the week with only NY Fed manufacturing on the docket.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Subdued trade in the energy complex as WTI (-0.3%) and Brent (-0.2%) futures gave up some of Friday’s gains, with the latter now straddling around the psychological USD 71.00/bbl level. Friday’s CFTC data showed that hedge funds raise bullish ICE WTI crude bets by 30.7k to 281.7k lots, whilst speculators increased net long positions in Brent crude (for a fifth consecutive week) by almost 9.5k to just over 358k in the week to April 9th. Over the weekend, Russia’s Finance Minister stated that OPEC+ could decide to raise production (at the June 25/26 meeting) to fight for market share with the US. Currently OPEC+ have agreed to curb output by 1.2mln BPD until June 2019, with IFX noting that Russia’s April production fell by 150k BPD vs the benchmark October level. Back in December, Russia committed to reducing output by 228k BPD from October levels of 11.4mln BPD in a gradual manner which would take place over several months.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, the precious metals sector is mostly in the red with gold (-0.4%) edging lower and breaching its 100 DMA (USD 1288/oz) to the downside as last week’s Chinese data somewhat eases fears of a global growth slowdown. Meanwhile, copper (-0.3%) gave up its overnight gains as the risk sentiment became more cautious during early EU trade. Finally, Shanghai steel futures hit a seven-and-a-half year high as the alloy is supported by firm demand, whilst its base metal, Dalian iron ore futures remained near record highs on dwindling Chinese stockpiles which declined the most since 2015, according to SteelHome data.</p>",

As such, the greenback’s major counterparts are firmer with GBP/USD testing 1.3100 to the upside and with EUR/USD extending on gains after having found support at the 1.1300 level and its nearby 50DMA at 1.1301, while Nordea has also gone long on the pair with a target of 1.1650 and considers a stop loss at 1.1187. Elsewhere, the firm risk appetite keeps USD/JPY near YTD highs around 112.00 and antipodeans also benefit from the risk tone, albeit to a lesser extent for AUD/USD following the decline in Chinese imports.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are softer as they track the recent losses in T-notes and with demand also dampened by gains in riskier assets as well as a lack of BoJ presence in the market today.&nbsp;</p>",
