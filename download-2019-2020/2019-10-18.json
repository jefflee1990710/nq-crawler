RANsquawk’s central banks weekly briefing can be <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23030/download\">accessed here</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Stocks came off on a variety of factors, from a China Q3 GDP miss, idiosyncratic negative stories from equity heavy weights JNJ, BA and AXP, de-risking ahead of this weekend’s Brexit vote, as well as technical factors, given that the SPX has once again failed to make significant ground above 3,000; some had also noted that on the leg lower, it was companies with thinner margins that were leading the downside; some even suggested that Fed’s Clarida’s lack of an explicit easing signal in his remarks contributed too. However, as Europeans left for the day, and headlines quietened down, US equity futures gradually drifted higher, paring much of the losses seen. On the US/China front, VP Pence will be giving a key address next Thursday on US/China relations, which the market thinks may take a hawkish tone, given that there was some pressure on stocks in wake of the report; US President Trump reiterated that a phase one deal could be signed at the November APEC meeting. The Buck was easing through the course of the session, and is closing out Friday’s session near the low of the week, extending the negative run to three straight weeks. The Treasury curve bull-steepened, and crude also came under pressure on the factors stated above, as well as this week’s inventory builds.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The impact of ‘super Saturday’, where UK lawmakers will sit for a special parliamentary session to vote on Brexit legislation, has been dulled somewhat, as it appears lawmakers will vote first on the so-called Letwin amendment, which could force the government to delay Brexit even if PM Johnson’s deal is approved, and could mean that Saturday’s proceedings could be diluted (the measure would withhold approval of the deal, until the legislation to enact it was safely passed – a move that would automatically trigger the Benn Act and force an A50 extension through 31st January 2020, and thus, the vote on Johnson’s deal might not even take place). Either way, lawmakers will sit between 0930 and 1430 local time, and desks have been crunching the arithmetic to assess the chances Johnson’s deal will pass. Johnson has tried, though seems unsuccessful in his efforts to woo the 10 DUP votes (Northern Irish), which was said to be key to unlocking the support of the 25 pro-Brexit ERG group (who have intimated it would back the deal if the DUP does, though others have noticed a more optimistic pivot from the group, suggesting it might still back the deal); even so, this will take his numbers to 288 of 320 required, meaning that much will also depend on the 21 ex-Conservative MPs (who lost the whip for rebelling against the government position in September; the majority of the 21 are reportedly backing the deal, according to FT), and crucially the Labour rebels (various reports suggest that there is 9 who will back Johnson, but there could be more, given that 19 Labour lawmakers representing 'leave' constituencies wrote to EU officials in early October intimating that they might support a deal), meaning that the numbers are likely to be tight (some suggest it is essentially a coin flip). An in depth run-down of what to expect can be found in our <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23031/download\">Week in Focus Preview.</a></p><p><strong>* US/EUROPE TRADE WAR:</strong> US announced it would recoup USD 7.5bln in damages by imposing tariffs on EU goods, in response to illegal subsidies for Airbus (AIR FP), after the WTO gave the greenlight to such a move on Monday. The plan will see duties of 10% on Airbus planes, and 25% tariffs for agricultural products (goods with \"protected name status\" will be impacted, including French wine, Italian cheese, and Scottish whisky). The tariffs will become effective from midnight on Friday. France has already warned of a \"concrete\" retaliation within the WTO framework; the EU is awaiting a similar WTO decision on subsidies to Boeing (BA) which is due in months.</p><p><strong>* CHINA Q3 GDP:</strong> The pace of Chinese GDP growth eased to the weakest since 1992 at 6.0% Y/Y in Q3, from 6.2% (and slightly shy of the 6.1% consensus), but remained within the government's 6.0-6.5% target range. Industrial production data fared better, somewhat offsetting the GDP miss. UBS has noted that this week's China data has shown an interesting pattern of rising inflation and slowing growth; CPI inflation tested the annual target (implied ceiling) of 3%, while GDP growth hits 6.0%, highlighting the challenges faced by the China's government: \"There is a clear pull to ease the monetary policy to support the real economy but also concerns about the impact of any sizable loosing on CPI inflation (you may argue that inflation is mainly driven by the surging pork price, but Chinese public pays attention to the overall level),\" UBS writes, \"policymakers will likely need to respond to pressure on the economy with a relatively loose monetary policy but meanwhile also ensure that the macro leverage ratio does not rise too much.\" The bank therefore believes that China will likely roll further targeted measures in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Clarida (Voter, Neutral) said policy is not a pre-set course and decisions will be made \"meeting by meeting\"; US economy in good place with no evidence of strong labour market putting pressure on inflation, which remains \"muted\". On growth, Clarida adds growth in H2 will be slower than H1, global manufacturing is slipping and relative to the July meeting, we have seen a downshift in overall growth. He notes the global economy is “sort of muddling through, it is not dire but not robust”. Clarida holds a view on yield curve inversion shared by others that it is due to the global economy, not just the US. On financial conditions, he said they are in a good place, credit spreads are stable, equity markets are doing well and the households are in a good place. Clarida echoed the Fed’s line that the recent treasury purchases should not be confused with QE. Fed's Williams (voter, neutral) said recent rate cuts position policy to appropriately address risks from trade uncertainty, global slowdown and subdued inflation, while he added the economy is in a good place and policy will be set on a meeting-by-meeting approach. Fed's George (voter, hawk, dissenter) said her outlook for monetary policy does not call for a monpol response; said strong consumer is key to her outlook; George warned that cutting rates as insurance risks overheating sectors that are performing well, and encourages risk-taking and leverages; rate cuts might contribute to increasing financial stability risks. George reiterated she will monitor incoming data, while noting corporate debt continues to rise to high levels, and lower capital levels at large banks could be costly to employment and growth. On the economy, George believes it is generally performing well. Fed's Kaplan (non-voter, dove) reiterated his 'wait and see' outlook; he also said that the most recent catalyst for slowdown in global growth is trade tensions, and he expects consumer spending to continue to be strong, but noted it was \"fragile\"; Kaplan does not see the Fed in a fully-fledged cutting cycle, adjustments would be more appropriate in a limited, restrained way, he said. Kaplan, who votes in 2020, said he saw a further rate cut next year, though he did not in September. Fed's Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said US economy is sending 'mixed signals'; Kashkari views the US consumer as strong, though business were nervous and pulling back on spending and hiring</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> Outgoing ECB President Draghi said the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate, says the effectiveness of monetary policy can and should be enhanced; ECB says there are mild signs of overstretched valuations in the Euro area. ECB's Visco warned that the central bank must be cautious in lower rates too deep into negative territory, warning that it might ultimately prove counterproductive. ECB's Knot (hawk) similarly said that there were some merits to negative rates, however, they have the potential to cause distortions in the future. ECB’s Holzmann (Hawk) said ECB should lower its inflation target in its upcoming policy review and that he would support a target of 1.5% or even lower, sees indications that EZ economic improvement is on its way, adding an orderly Brexit would help.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY: </strong>After Turkey and the US on Thursday reached an 'agreement' over Turkey's incursion into Syria (where Turkey will halt its offensive within 120 hours to allow the Syrian Democratic Forces to withdraw from a designated safe zone along the Turkish border, and once that has come to a halt, the US will lift the sanctions it recently imposed), reports on Friday suggested fighting was continuing, despite the reports of the 'ceasefire'; however, the Guardian reported that while the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander acknowledged the ceasefire, he said his fighters were ready to abide by it only in the border strip between Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad, the other town under Turkish attack; other SDF officials have also noted that fighting was continuing despite the latest agreements.</p><p><strong>* RBA:</strong> Governor Lowe said negative rates in Australia were unlikely, and also hinted that the economy may be slowly improving.</p><p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> BOJ Governor Kuroda reiterated BOJ will ease if needed, and has room to do so; if risks are heightening, economy may lose momentum to hit its price target.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BoE Governor Carney sees many different monetary policy paths post-Brexit; when asked about the potential for post-Brexit hikes, he said he would not be pre-committing. Carney seemed to suggest that the Bank’s reaction function will be not only be premised on UK factors, but global too. BoE's Haldane (Hawkish) said that with the output gap closed, growing the economy is about growing the supply side, and productive potential rather than the demand side and that calls for a different set of tools and policies citing global trade concerns that continue to linger says the BoE would react in a normal time frame to a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.4% at 2986, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.9% at 26772, NASDAQ-100 -0.9% at 7868;</strong> SECTORS: Utilities&nbsp; 0.4%, Financials&nbsp; 0.2%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.2%, Materials&nbsp; -0.1%, Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.3%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.3%, Energy&nbsp; -0.5%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.9%, Industrials&nbsp; -0.9%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.9%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>DJ<strong> </strong>heavyweight Boeing (BA) was hit during hours following reports that instant messages from 2016 shows that employees misled the FAA about a key safety system on the 737 MAX jet, with the FAA now reviewing to determine what action is appropriate. Consumer staples were among the better performers, following earnings from Coca Cola (KO), which beat on revenues while EPS fell in line, adding it sees at least 5% growth in organic revenues in non-gaap terms; sees at least 12% growth in comp FX neutral net revenues in non-gaap terms in FY 2019. American Express (AXP) saw choppy trade at the open however eventually closed lower despite beats on both top and bottom lines, with some citing the lack of an outlook upgrade as a negative. State Street (STT) rallied and was a key outperformer in the SPX on Friday, following top and bottom line beats, although NII did decline to 644mln from 672mln. Kansas City Southern (KSU) and Intuitve Surgical (ISRG) also outperformers following strong earnings. Healthcare was lower led by Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) as it is voluntarily recalling a single lot of baby powder in the US after an FDA test indicated the presence of sub-trace levels of chrysotile asbestos. Tesla (TSLA) traded lower amid reports from Elektrek it is pushing back the delivery times in the US, however it is due to a surge in demand in Europe and the other markets, so perhaps all is not doom and gloom. L Brands (LB) took a hit after a downgrade at Credit Suisse as analyst Binetti believes the structural challenges are set to increase and expects 2020 figures to be revised significantly lower. Binetti also downgraded fellow retailer, Gap (GPS).</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLE USD 0.16 LOWER AT USD 53.87/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTELE USD 0.49 LOWER AT USD 59.42/BBL: </strong>Crude was under pressure after softer than expected China GDP data, while equity downside was also said to have contributed, though Citi notes the correlation between equities and crude has weakened in recent days. Baker Hughes reported US oil rigs rose by 1 to 713, natgas rigs fell 6 at 137, leaving the total rig count down 5 at 851. Meanwhile, analysts at UBS said they see Brent prices rising towards USD 63 per bbl by year-end, before paring towards USD 55 per bbl by mid-2020.</p><p><strong>*US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-01.</strong> The Treasury curve bull-steepened on Friday, with yields falling across the curve after softer than expected China GDP, while equity downside also contributed to the upside. Remarks from Fed officials did not deliver any explicit signal ahead of the blackout period, though none leaned too heavily on market pricing, which is pricing a 25bps rate cut with a very high degree of certainty; and this is in keeping with recent commentary (Evans sees no further cuts this year, Kaplan is agnostic, Williams is yet to decide, Powell last week said he was taking it meeting-by-meeting, and Clarida today provided two-way arguments); amid Clarida’s remarks, the TPLEX was stable though equities came under pressure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP - GBP: </strong>Consolidation and position squaring appear to have replaced the hype and histrionics that have dominated proceedings for the most part this week, with Cable relatively restrained between 1.2920-1.2840 boundaries and Eur/Gbp holding within a 0.8665-15 range compared to wtd parameters of 1.2990-1.2520 and 0.8810-0.8575 respectively. It has certainly been a long week in the markets as well as politics even though Monday trade/volumes were hampered by multi-centre holidays, including the US and Japan, with the primary focus on Brexit and events leading up to and into Thursday-Friday’s EU Summit. In short, negotiations resumed after UK PM Johnson presented an alternative blueprint for the backstop that was initially rejected by the EU, but after ‘intense’ if not so-called tunnel talks a draft deal was eventually sealed just hours before the official meeting kicked off in Brussels. Johnson and his EU peers collectively lauded the treaty as a great plan for both sides of the channel and the assumption (in the markets and media) was that the DUP was also on board. However, the coalition party was still unhappy with several elements of the new arrangements for customs, consent and VAT, with the upshot that it is sticking to original objections and will vote against when the bill is put to Parliament tomorrow.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>Disappointing data and a weaker than forecast headline Philly Fed print contributed to the Dollar’s downfall during the course of the week, but its steady decline was also due to relative strength elsewhere and more positive perceptions regarding US-China trade relations that was also evident in a degree of YUAN appreciation. The DXY remains on the backfoot and closer to the base of 98.650-97.402 parameters, but from a tech perspective just above the 200 DMA (97.390/380).</p><p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>The Aussie has netted decent gains vs its US counterpart after a few wobbles and early weakness prompted by RBA minutes underscoring guidance for a prolonged period of low rates and the bias to ease further if necessary. However, the tide turned after solid labour data and Aud/Usd just touched 0.6850 vs lows around 0.6725, but the Aud/Nzd cross has lost momentum after topping out a few pips shy of 1.0800 and Nzd/Usd picked up pace following its recovery from sub-0.6250 levels through 0.6300 and then 0.6350. Note, firmer than expected NZ CPI for Q3 was largely countered by downbeat/dovish comments from RBNZ Assistant Governor Bascand along the way. Elsewhere, the Loonie has also appreciated vs its US rival and tested the resolve of bids at 1.3130, with stops said to be poised for a break, from around 1.3240 at the other end of the spectrum. Mixed Canadian releases have not really impacted, or oil prices, as the Cad inversely tracked Usd moves and an overall improvement in risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>* CHF, EUR, JPY: </strong>All on course to end the week firmer vs the Greenback and close to new or prior peaks, with the Franc eyeing 0.9850, Euro looking at 1.1150 and Yen pivoting 108.50. Nevertheless, independent drivers/factors have been largely overshadowed by external developments, like Brexit, progression towards signing off US-China trade pact Phase One and geopolitics.</p><p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>In stark contrast to the broad trend, the Norwegian Krona has been undermined by multiple negatives and plumbed to all time depths vs the Euro around 10.2350, but the Swedish Crown has overturned losses from 10.8820 to circa 10.7700 ahead of next week’s Riksbank meeting with the market split on guidance between a roll back or even removal of repo tightening over the turn of the year vs keeping a hike on the agenda. Note, Swedish jobs data was dire, but mitigated by flaws in some of the figures collected, per Statistics Sweden, and the Norges Bank is also up next week, but widely tipped to stick to an on hold after September’s ¼ point depo hike message.</p><p><strong>* EM:</strong> Volatile trade across the region, but for the Rand and Lira especially due to specific issues, with Usd/Try reaching 5.9350+ peaks at one stage on more repercussions from Turkey’s Syrian offensive and Usd/Zar up over 15.0500 when SA’s Eskom announced rolling power outages. However, both pairs have reversed course since, and the US-engineered ceasefire after a diplomatic truce forged with Turkish President Erdogan has been a major catalyst alongside technical and the SA Government approving legislation for energy outsourcing.</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Brexit takes top billing, as trade and geopolitics vie for best supporting act",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Consolidation and position squaring appear to have replaced the hype and histrionics that have dominated proceedings for the most part this week, with Cable relatively restrained between 1.2920-1.2840 boundaries and Eur/Gbp holding within a 0.8665-15 range compared to wtd parameters of 1.2990-1.2520 and 0.8810-0.8575 respectively. It has certainly been a long week in the markets as well as politics even though Monday trade/volumes were hampered by multi-centre holidays, including the US and Japan, with the primary focus on Brexit and events leading up to and into Thursday-Friday’s EU Summit. In short, negotiations resumed after UK PM Johnson presented an alternative blueprint for the backstop that was initially rejected by the EU, but after ‘intense’ if not so called tunnel talks a draft deal was eventually sealed just hours before the official meeting kicked off in Brussels. Johnson and his EU peers collectively lauded the treaty as a great plan for both sides of the channel and the assumption (in the markets and media) was that the DUP was also on board. However, the coalition party was still unhappy with several elements of the new arrangements for customs, consent and VAT, with the upshot that it is sticking to original objections and will vote against when the bill is put to Parliament tomorrow.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Disappointing data and a weaker than forecast headline Philly Fed print contributed to the Dollar’s downfall during the course of the week, but its steady decline was also due to relative strength elsewhere and more positive perceptions regarding US-China trade relations that was also evident in a degree of <strong>YUAN </strong>appreciation. The <strong>DXY</strong> remains on the backfoot and closer to the base of 98.650-97.402 parameters, but from a tech perspective just above the 200 DMA (97.390/380).</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has netted decent gains vs its US counterpart after a few wobbles and early weakness prompted by RBA minutes underscoring guidance for a prolonged period of low rates and the bias to ease further if necessary. However, the tide turned after solid labour data and Aud/Usd just touched 0.6850 vs lows around 0.6725, but the Aud/Nzd cross has lost momentum after topping out a few pips shy of 1.0800 and Nzd/Usd picked up pace following its recovery from sub-0.6250 levels through 0.6300 and then 0.6350. Note, firmer than expected NZ CPI for Q3 was largely countered by downbeat/dovish comments from RBNZ Assistant Governor Bascand along the way. Elsewhere, the Loonie has also appreciated vs its US rival and tested the resolve of bids at 1.3130, with stops said to be poised for a break, from around 1.3240 at the other end of the spectrum. Mixed Canadian releases have not really impacted, or oil prices, as the Cad inversely tracked Usd moves and an overall improvement in risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on course to end the week firmer vs the Greenback and close to new or prior peaks, with the Franc eyeing 0.9850, Euro looking at 1.1150 and Yen pivoting 108.50. Nevertheless, independent drivers/factors have been largely overshadowed by external developments, like Brexit, progression towards signing off US-China trade pact Phase One and geopolitics.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to the broad trend, the Norwegian Krona has been undermined by multiple negatives and plumbed to all time depths vs the Euro around 10.2350, but the Swedish Crown has overturned losses from 10.8820 to circa 10.7700 ahead of next week’s Riksbank meeting with the market split on guidance between a roll back or even removal of repo tightening over the turn of the year vs keeping a hike on the agenda. Note, Swedish jobs data was dire, but mitigated by flaws in some of the figures collected, per Statistics Sweden, and the Norges Bank is also up next week, but widely tipped to stick to an on hold after September’s ¼ point depo hike message.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Volatile trade across the region, but for the Rand and Lira especially due to specific issues, with Usd/Try reaching 5.9350+ peaks at one stage on more repercussions from Turkey’s Syrian offensive and Usd/Zar up over 15.0500 when SA’s Eskom announced rolling power outages. However, both pairs have reversed course since, and the US-engineered ceasefire after a diplomatic truce forged with Turkish President Erdogan has been a major catalyst alongside technical and the SA Government approving legislation for energy outsourcing.</p>",

        "subject": "BREXIT ANALYSIS: Meaningful Vote No.4 - Johnson brings his deal to Parliament",
        "content": "<p>On Saturday, Parliament will return for a special sitting to vote on UK PM Johnson’s Brexit deal (9.30 BST to 14.30 BST), which he agreed with the EU on Thursday just prior to the start of the EU Council Summit. The government needs 320 votes in order to secure a majority, although this number could come down should In the interim, the government will attempt to drum up as much support as possible for its deal, with potential negotiations ongoing with various factions within parliament likely ensuing in the background.</p><p><strong>* Parliamentary Arithmetic:</strong></p><p><strong>259 are likely to definitely back the deal</strong>&nbsp;– On former UK PM May’s final attempt to get her Brexit deal through parliament,&nbsp;279 Conservatives&nbsp;backed her deal. However, since then a group of these MPs have been either been expelled from or left the party, while one Conservative MP lost a bi-election. However, it is expected that the remaining 259 are likely to back the deal.</p><p><strong>Tory rebels</strong>&nbsp;– 21 were expelled from the party for voting for the passage of the Benn Act, which mandated UK PM Johnson to request an extension had he failed to reach an agreement with the EU before 19th October, a law that the government argued undermined its negotiating position. Desks have noted that some voted for the Benn Act out of mistrust in UK PM Johnson, fearing his true strategy was to pursue a no deal exit. These MPs may be looking for a way back into the party, hence, they may be inclined to vote for the revised deal. However, other MPs, such as former Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond, have been pushing for a closer relationship with the EU that would see the UK stay in the EU’s customs union and may be more difficult to sway. Indeed, the Times reported that the rebel Tory group is split on whether or not to vote for Johnson’s deal – with 9&nbsp;indicating they will vote for it and 9 undecided. This was in contrast to earlier comments from MP Letwin, who said 17-18 of the rebels may back the deal.</p><p><strong>The DUP 10</strong>&nbsp;– The Party released a statement saying it would not back the deal (NOTE: not abstain), in line with an earlier statement which raised concerns over the issues of consent and VAT.</p><p><strong>The 28 Eurosceptic “Spartans”</strong>&nbsp;– Conservative MPs who refused to vote for May’s deal, headed by MP Steve Baker. This group would prefer a no deal to a deal in its current form. There has also been suggestions that they would follow the DUP in rejection of the deal, as they have in the past. However, in recent days Baker has been less hawkish; on Tuesday he was optimistic Johnson could reach a “tolerable” deal. Given the fact that the Benn Act essentially takes no deal at the end of the month off of the table, after which there is likely to be either a general election or second referendum, these ultra-Eurosceptic MPs may fear that this deal could be there last opportunity to deliver Brexit. Two of the Spartans are in Johnson’s cabinet, and thus are likely to back the deal. Indeed, as of Friday morning, a number of Spartans has already reportedly come on board, while the Eurosceptic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://leave.eu/\">leave.eu</a>&nbsp;campaign also endorsed Johnson’s deal.</p><p><strong>Labour rebels? (Maybe 20)</strong>&nbsp;– A number of Labour members preside over leave voting constituents. Former UK PM May gambled that such MPs would want to honour the referendum and support her deal, but only managed to get 5 Labour rebels to back her deal. However, since then the sands have shifted; the Labour Party is officially backing a second referendum now rather than pursuing its own Brexit deal, while the Liberal Democrats want to revoke Article 50 rather than have a second referendum – an unequivocal shift towards more pro-remain positions. In fact, 19 Labour MPs, including 15 who didn’t back May’s deal, signed a letter to EC President Juncker, urging the EU to do a deal with the UK; indicating that this time around they will be inclined to vote for a deal. However, seeing as a key part of Labour’s election strategy is to defeat the UK government, by voting down a deal and forcing an extension (something that would embarrass UK PM Johnson given his “do or die” pledge to leave with or without a deal),&nbsp;Labour MPs may risk expulsion for defying the party whip.&nbsp;Another key concern of many Labour MPs is the potential for the erosion of worker and environmental rights post-Brexit; the government may attempt to give “assurances” to allay these concerns. On Friday morning, Labour MP Mann announced that he would vote for Johnson’s deal and said “at least 9 Labour MPs” would also vote for the deal. It is also worth noting the possibility that Labour MPs sat in leave seats may abstain, effectively lowering the governments 320 vote target.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5 Independents</strong>&nbsp;– Four of the five voted for former UK PM May’s deal, while the fifth, John Woodcock, may also be tempted.</p><p><strong>2 Other MPs</strong>&nbsp;– Liberal Democrat MP Lamb, who presides over a leave voting seat, has been critical of his party’s anti-Brexit stance. UK PM Johnson’s brother Jo Johnson voted for May’s last deal and, despite resigning from his post in the current government, may be inclined to vote for the government’s deal.</p><p><strong>In Total: </strong>Out of the pool of 86 MPs listed above, Johnson needs to secure the votes of 61 in order to get his deal through parliament. Saturday’s special Parliamentary sitting will be the crunch time, with the vote likely between the hours of 9.30-14.00 BST.</p><p><strong>* POTENTIAL FOR AN EXTENSION:</strong>&nbsp;Should Johnson’s deal be voted down, the Benn Act mandates that he request a three-month extension from the EU is likely to granted. However,&nbsp;recent reports out of the EU indicate that they may see a three month extensions as too short, opting instead for another six months (which the UK would have to accept as mandated by the Benn Act). Should Johnson’s deal be accepted by parliament, the Benn Act would become voided. The UK will then have two weeks to ratify the agreement, which may be not be enough time, argues ING. “There are several ways this latter process could go awry” says the bank, explaining that “there will need to be a raft of legislation published, scrutinised, passed, and maybe even amended”. Moreover, if the deal does pass it is likely to do so only with a slim majority; “PM Johnson will need to carry this majority with him through this potentially turbulent parliamentary process” adds ING. Therefore, if two weeks is not enough time, PM Johnson may have to ask for an extension. Although he has pledged not to do so, he may be tempted to arrange a short technical extension as long as the UK has actually left the EU prior to the UK’s next election. However, the fact that he may not keep a small risk of a no deal exit on the table (whether by accident or not). However, in an effort to keep no deal off of the table should Johnson’s deal gain approval, MPs Letwin and Boles proposed an amendment to the bill, that would force the government to seek a three-month extension by 11pm on Saturday – a request that would be automatically rescinded once all of the ratification of Johnson’s deal is completed prior to 31 October (this is seen as an insurance policy to prevent hard Brexiteers from pulling the plug on ratification and causing an accidental no deal exit).</p><p><strong>* ELECTION:</strong>&nbsp;Whether or not PM Johnson’s deal passes parliament on Saturday, he looks to be in a good position going in to the next election – if succeeds and takes the UK out of the EU (whether on time or not), he can say he has delivered Brexit; conversely, if he fails, he can frame it as a people vs parliament election, with a “remain” parliament set on stopping/holding up Brexit, despite him agreeing a deal with the EU. Currently, the Conservative Party sits at a healthy 37% in the polls. Desks note however, that in 2017, Former UK PM May has a similar lead in the polls going into an election and ended up losing her majority. ING flags the possibility that, if Johnson does deliver Brexit, opposition Labour MPs may block the government’s push for an election. Currently Labour is sitting at the low 20s% in polling – MPs may prefer to delay an election, hoping that the government’s post Brexit momentum wanes as the focus returns to domestic policy. However, Labour Leader Corbyn has said he wants an election as soon as possible (so long as a no-deal exit on 31 October is off the table).</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - Sterling remains relatively strong, but in much more sedate trade awaiting the fate of the latest Brexit deal at the hands of MPs tomorrow, with the Parliamentary vote expected to be very tight. However, despite ongoing DUP opposition and little sign that the coalition party will be won round, Cable is nudging higher within 1.2840-1.2920 confines and Eur/Gbp remains depressed between 0.8660-15 parameters. For the record, option break-even pricing is around 2 big figures and the loftiest since the 2016 EU referendum, though this could be deemed quite conservative given even bigger swings in the Pound seen of late.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - It’s been nip and tuck down under for the most part this week, but the Kiwi has overtaken the Aussie in wake of mixed Chinese data overnight, as Nzd/Usd breaches 0.6350 and the Aud/Nzd cross reverses further from post-Aussie labour report peaks just shy of 1.0800 through 1.0750. Nevertheless, Aud/Usd is consolidating gains above 0.6800 amidst general Greenback weakness with the DXY hovering around 97.500 ahead of the final pre-October FOMC Fed speakers and following mostly sub-consensus US data and surveys in the run up.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/JPY </strong>- All narrowly mixed against the Buck, as the single currency maintains 1.1100+ status and in bullish mode alongside Cable, eyeing yesterday’s circa 1.1140 high that coincides with the 100 DMA and is close to a Fib retracement level. Meanwhile, the Loonie is sitting tight in a 1.3130-45 band, while the safe-haven Franc and Yen roam either side of 0.9875 and 108.60 respectively.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong> - In contrast to the Antipodean Dollar dovetailing noted above, clear divergence has been more apparent in Scandinavia where Norway’s Crown is extending declines to new record lows vs the Euro and losing more ground relative to its Swedish peer. Thursday’s seemingly poor jobs data from Sweden has been largely shrugged aside due to sub-standard elements of the figures collated, while it remains a close call whether the Riksbank retains its tightening bias and/or the Norges Bank reaffirms and on hold stance after September’s 25 bp hike.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Although rallies or recoveries against the Dollar are trending across the region, Usd/Try has reversed further than most other pairs (to circa 5.7500 at one stage) on the back of sheer Lira relief that the US has put sanctions on hold in acknowledgement of the 5-day ceasefire in Northern Syria forged with Turkey.</p><p><strong>Major FX option expiries for today's NY cut</strong></p><p><strong>- EUR/GBP</strong>: 0.8600 (750M), <strong>0.8700-20 (1BLN) ­</strong>- <strong>AUD/USD</strong>: 0.6765 (400M), 0.6780 (280M),<strong> 0.6790-0.6800 (1.5BLN) </strong>-<strong> USD/JPY:</strong> 107.85 (1.5BLN), 107.95-108.10 (1.6BLN)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Only time will tell, but for now <strong>Gilts</strong> continue to sag and drag core debt counterparts with them on the premise or perception that momentum may be gradually building behind the Boris Johnson version/vision of Brexit. Indeed, the 10 year UK benchmark is just off a new 131.43 Liffe low, albeit well above Thursday’s pre-DUP deal denouncement base, with <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>T-notes</strong> following suit to 171.41 and 129-25 respectively. Ahead, US LEI and the last words from the Fed pre-purdah, but perhaps more importantly a final UK Cabinet meeting before Saturday’s big event (England’s Rugby Quarter final face-off against Australia aside!).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Crude prices are drifting higher, although there is a lack of fresh fundamental drivers. ING note that factors possibly contributing to yesterday’s <strong>WTI</strong> (post-DoE) rise were inventory draws across all the other refined products. The key driver behind the draws seen across the products, argues the bank, was seasonal refinery turnarounds, with refinery run rates falling by 2.6 percentage points over the week to average 83.1%, the lowest level since September 2017. Looking ahead, the UK Parliament’s vote on PM Johnson’s new Brexit deal is likely the most notable weekend risk factor, albeit the docket includes a slew of Fed voters on US economy ahead of the Fed blackout period. Elsewhere, in metals, <strong>Gold</strong> prices have steadily declining on Friday morning, despite lower equities and the downbeat Chinese data. On which note, <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain under pressure, as data provided further evidence of a slowdown in its biggest market, China. Desks are citing the slowdown as more evidence of the negative effect of the US/China trade war on global growth. However, this week’s constructive tone on the state of US/China trade negotiations from both sides, combined with the agreement on a Brexit deal by the EU and UK has helped to cushion losses. Meanwhile, this week <strong>Dalian</strong> iron ore futures have suffered from one its largest weekly declines in two months. Analysts point to tightening restrictions on Chinese steel production over air quality issues and, more broadly, the slowing global demand for Chinese steel and iron ore.&nbsp;</p>",

As expected, the USTR Office confirmed in a notice to the industry that the planned 10% and 25% tariffs on EU goods will take effect today. In response, the EU has said it will retaliate, and is pursuing its own case against the US for the alleged illegal subsidies for Boeing at the WTO. Sectors are mixed and being buffeted by earnings; Consumer Staples (-0.6%) is the laggard. Movers are largely earnings driven – France’s Danone (-7.9%) sunk after it cut its sales guidance, with weakness seen in US sales and the demand for bottled water in Europe. Automakers in particular are under pressure; Renault (-12.3%) sunk after the Co. downgraded its FY outlook, citing weakness in markets such as Turkey and Argentina. Similarly, Volvo (-0.4%) fell after the Co. gave weak guidance and Truck orders were seen slumping 45% Y/Y. Other notable movers include; Remy Cointreau (-0.6%) fell after the Co. posted weaker sales than expected, with notable weakness in HK. Elsewhere, strong earnings from Vivendi (+1.4%), Assa Abloy (+1.3%), Casino (+1.4%) and LSE (+1.0%) sees their respective share prices higher. Weak earnings from Thales (-5.8%), in which the Co. also cut FY19 revenue guidance, sees the Co. as one of the laggards in the CAC40. Outside of earnings; RBS (+1.6%) moved higher after being upgraded to overweight at JPMorgan and Deutsche Post (+1.1%) were buoyed by an upgrade at Berenberg. Finally, Sandvik (+2.9%) spiked higher after the Co.’s operating profits exceeded expectations and the Co. upgraded its net financial items estimate.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - Sterling remains relatively strong, but in much more sedate trade awaiting the fate of the latest Brexit deal at the hands of MPs tomorrow, with the Parliamentary vote expected to be very tight.

ING note that factors possibly contributing to yesterday’s <strong>WTI</strong> (post-DoE) rise were inventory draws across all the other refined products. The key driver behind the draws seen across the products, argues the bank, was seasonal refinery turnarounds, with refinery run rates falling by 2.6 percentage points over the week to average 83.1%, the lowest level since September 2017. Looking ahead, the UK Parliament’s vote on PM Johnson’s new Brexit deal is likely the most notable weekend risk factor, albeit the docket includes a slew of Fed voters on US economy ahead of the Fed blackout period. Elsewhere, in metals, <strong>Gold</strong> prices have steadily declining on Friday morning, despite lower equities and the downbeat Chinese data. On which note, <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain under pressure, as data provided further evidence of a slowdown in its biggest market, China. Desks are citing the slowdown as more evidence of the negative effect of the US/China trade war on global growth. However, this week’s constructive tone on the state of US/China trade negotiations from both sides, combined with the agreement on a Brexit deal by the EU and UK has helped to cushion losses. Meanwhile, this week <strong>Dalian</strong> iron ore futures have suffered from one its largest weekly declines in two months. Analysts point to tightening restrictions on Chinese steel production over air quality issues and, more broadly, the slowing global demand for Chinese steel and iron ore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.1%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%)</strong> were indecisive and eventually deteriorated following a flurry of tier-1 data releases from China which showed its economic growth slowed to the weakest pace since 1992, although Q/Q and YTD GDP figures matched analysts’ forecasts, while Industrial Production surpassed estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat after a rebound from yesterday’s late selling pressure in which prices briefly tested 154.00 to the downside, while demand subdued as Japanese stocks remained afloat and with today’s BoJ Rinban operations at a relatively tepid JPY 150bln in the long and super-long end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos for a net weekly injection of CNY 30bln vs. Prev.

(Newswires)</p><p>FX&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was subdued near the prior day’s lows around the 97.50 level due to the recent strength in its European counterparts following the announcement of the breakthrough in Brussels, which saw <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> gain a footing above 1.1100 and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> approach just shy of the 1.3000 handle. Nonetheless, both pairs have since pulled back from their multi-month highs amid doubts on whether PM Johnson can get the deal passed in Parliament. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> traded lacklustre and JPY-crosses mostly held on to recent gains as they largely reflected their base currencies and following Japanese inflation data which showed Core CPI softened to a 2½-year low as expected. Elsewhere, antipodeans remained firm against the greenback following a stronger <strong>CNY</strong> reference rate and despite the mixed Chinese data with outperformance in <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> after it broke through resistance at 0.6350 to print a fresh monthly high, while TRY also benefitted after US and Turkey reached a deal for a 5-day ceasefire to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw from the designated safe zone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were quiet overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures pulled back below the USD 54.00/bbl but still held on to the majority of the gains seen in the prior session where prices were underpinned despite a much larger than expected build in EIA. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were steady with the precious metal kept float by recent weakness in the greenback, while the mixed Chinese data releases including its slowest economic growth since 1992 kept <strong>copper</strong> prices lacklustre.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong> <strong>US VP Pence and Turkish President Erdogan reached a deal to suspend the Turkish incursion in Syria for 120 hours to allow YPG to withdraw from the designated safe zone</strong>. US VP Pence said the US will not impose further sanctions with the implementation of the ceasefire and that President Trump has agreed to withdraw economic sanctions after the implementation of the deal, while he added that both US and Turkey are committed to a peaceful resolution of the safe zone. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Turkish Foreign Minister said this is not a ceasefire and suggested ceasefires are only between two legitimate sides</strong>. The minister also stated they agreed with the US on the collection of heavy arms from the YPG and the destruction of their positions, while he noted there were no guarantees to the US over the Kobani region. (Newswires)</p><p>US House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Schumer said the US-Turkey agreement seriously undermines credibility of US foreign policy and that the House will pass a bipartisan sanctions package on Turkey next week.

Participants initially sold the haven assets on the completion of the Brexit deal in early trade but pared losses throughout the rest of the session, lacking much conviction in late doors. Curve was little changed at settlement with yields up approximately up 1bp across the curve. US T-notes (Z9) settled 2+ ticks lower at 129-29.</p><p><strong>Fed's Evans (Voter, Dove)</strong> said unemployment is not so low that high inflation is an urgent threat, while he suggested the Fed should cautiously probe for the true level of maximum employment. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Williams (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said the Fed will adjust the plan for money markets as appropriate and that the Fed has a lot of tools to address potential downturn such as asset purchases and forward guidance. Furthermore, Williams said recent rate cuts position policy to appropriately address risks from trade uncertainty, global slowdown and subdued inflation, while he added the economy is in a good place and policy will be set on a meeting-by-meeting approach.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region cautious after the rally from the Brexit deal breakthrough petered out amid uncertainty whether it will receive enough support in Parliament and as participants mull over mixed Chinese data including GDP which printed at its weakest in nearly 3 decades. ASX 200 (-0.6%) is the underperformer with Consumer Staples and Tech leading the broad weakness across its sectors, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) edged a fresh YTD high as it benefits from recent currency outflows as well as reports South Korea is willing to enter discussions to settle bilateral tensions with Japan on forced-labour issues. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are indecisive following a flurry of tier-1 data releases from China which showed its economic growth slowed to 6.0% vs. Exp. 6.1% (Prev. 6.2%), although Q/Q and YTD figures matched analysts’ forecasts at 1.5% and 6.2% respectively, while Industrial Production topped estimates at 5.8% vs. Exp. 5.0%.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is subdued near the prior day’s lows around the 97.50 level as a function of the recent strength in its European counterparts following the announcement of the breakthrough in Brussels, which saw EUR/USD gain a footing above 1.1100 and GBP/USD approach just shy of the 1.3000 handle. Nonetheless, both pairs have since pulled back from their multi-month highs amid doubts on whether PM Johnson can get the deal passed after the government’s confidence and supply partner DUP vowed to vote against it and considering PM Johnson’s high track record of Parliamentary defeats, with some including the Labour leadership also suggesting the deal was worse than former PM May’s agreement which was rejected 3 times by lawmakers. Elsewhere, USD/JPY trades lacklustre and JPY-crosses mostly hold on to recent gains as they largely reflect their base currencies and following Japanese inflation data which showed Core CPI softened to a 2½-year low as expected. Elsewhere, antipodeans remain firmer against the greenback following a stronger CNY reference rate and despite the mixed Chinese data with NZD/USD outperforming after it broke through resistance at 0.6350 to print a fresh monthly high, while TRY also benefits overnight after US and Turkey reached a deal to suspend the Turkish incursion in Syria for 5 days to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw from the designated safe zone.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat after having recovered from yesterday’s late selling pressure in which prices briefly tested 154.00 to the downside, with demand dampened amid gains in Japanese stocks and with today’s BoJ Rinban operations at a relatively tepid JPY 150bln in the long and super-long end.</p>",
