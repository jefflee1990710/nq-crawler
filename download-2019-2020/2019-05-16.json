Qualcom (QCOM), Xilinx (XLNX), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Micron Technologies (MU), Analog Devices (ADI) and IPG Photonics Corp (IPGP) all finished firmly in the red. Cisco Systems (CSCO), however, shrugged off US/China trade related concerns, moving higher premarket after posting strong earnings; the chipmaker beating expectations on both top and bottom lines whilst revising Q4 guidance higher, a revision which the co said does take into account the impact of tariffs. Walmart (WMT) also moved higher after posting strong earnings. These strong earnings, in addition to strong housing data, helped propel Wall Street to a third consecutive day of gains, in which large tech names were some of the key beneficiaries. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and PayPal (PYPL) all moved higher. Amazon (AMZN) also moved higher, with the share price finding additional support form news the tech giant would introduce a new model of its Fire device aimed at children.

Speakers: Fed's Clarida &amp; Williams Speaking; BoJ's Kuroda &amp; ECB's de Guindos</p><p>* FRIDAY’S EARNINGS: Deere &amp; Co, EasyJet</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> After market on Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a national emergency to protect US computer networks. The measures did not name a company, but seem to be aimed at China's Huawei (and ZTE), banning it from buying key US tech without approval, and effectively banning its equipment from US telecom networks. China's foreign ministry said that Beijing will take necessary measures to safeguard its rights and interests, and also suggested that moves against Huawei could overshadow the ongoing trade talks. China's commerce ministry stated that the nation firmly opposes bullying by the US, adding that China will have to take countermeasures if the US keeps pressing. MOFCOM also cast some down on Wednesday's suggestions that a US delegation was to head to Beijing, perhaps as early as next week, saying they had no such information. MOFOC also said that it was not true that President Trump and Xi must meet in order to resolve the trade war.</p><p><strong>* USMCA/EUROPEAN TRADE:</strong> US Commerce Secretary Ross stated that talks continue with Mexico and Canada on metals tariffs. Ross also said that Trump will decide if auto tariffs talks will continue beyond May, intimating that the decision to delay the imposition of auto tariffs on European vehicles was still to be decided. German Economy Minister Altmaier said later in the session that the EU and the US are expected to begin talks on the cutting of tariffs in weeks</p><p><strong>* FED: Governor Brainard (Voter, Dove) </strong>said the employment/inflation relationship has \"broken down\", and weak inflation poses risks that households and businesses could set expectations in a way that makes it harder for the Fed to reach its inflation goal. She stated that the low unemployment is helping the workers at the margin of the labour market, but low interest rates pose risks to financial markets, and that countercyclical capital buffers for banks could allow for a continuation of low rates whilst controlling financial market risks. <strong>Fed's Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> reiterated familiar dovish arguments that monetary policy has been too tight during the recovery, which has lead to a slower-than-necessary recovery; current low inflation expectations have limited the Fed's ability to respond in the next downturn. He adds that wages are rising but not so fast as to believe that inflation would surge.</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BOC said overall risk to the nation's financial system has risen slightly since June 2018 amid slowdown in economic growth, oil slump and increased risk-taking in global markets. BoC's Poloz said the risk of a sharp increase in long-term interest rates from increased global risk premiums is moderate, but increasing; he was closely monitoring the the risk of stricter mortgage guidelines shifting consumers towards private lenders. Poloz argued that the fall in global bond yields this year has lowered mortgage rates in Canada, so household borrowing is likely to pick up again, and the BOC is not expecting the household slowdown to be so sharp in Q4. On trade, the MPR noted that the US/China trade war escalation remains a primary risk, and that is still the case currently. BOC's Wilkins said the fragility of corporate debt funding is not a stability issue for the wider financial sector.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB's Visco said monetary policy can rely on a wide range of tools to support an economy, and the ECB stands ready to fulfil its mandate if necessary; Visco also said it would be a mistake to believe that monetary policy would be disarmed if the Euro Area falls into a recession which led to deflation. ECB's Weidmann blames companies’ savings for driving current account imbalance.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May met with the 1922 Committee if backbench MPs, and Committee chair Brady stated that the two agreed to meet following the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (which is scheduled to be voted on in the week of the 3rd June) to agree a timetable for the election of a new leader of the Conservative Party; the intention is to have a new leader in place for the Conservative Party conference on 29 September. As it stands, the WAB is still likely to fail, and therefore, attention is shifting on who will be leading the party. Bookies have former foreign minister Boris Johnson leading the race (he today openly said he would be running for the role), followed by former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, and former Health Minister Michael Gove (all Brexiteers).</p><p><strong>* US MAY PHILLY FED: </strong>The Philly Fed stole the thunder of the pre-market US data, putting in an upside surprise beat. Pantheon said the beat was welcome, and reflected the upturn of China PMIs of late. Like the Empire State survey, though, the details are weaker than the headline sentiment index, but were not uniformly at odds with the headline. \"Moreover, comparing the Philly sub indexes to the headline ISM national manufacturing index tells the same story as the Empire State, namely, that the drop in the ISM index in April likely will reverse in May.\" Pantheon says that while it can be said that the industrial economy is weak, it is probably no longer weakening. \"The re-escalation of the trade war is a wild card, but China's stimulus means that the global manufacturing story is beginning to turn around,\" the consultancy wrote, \"the sector accounts for only 9% of US jobs and 12% of GDP, but it has a disproportionate impact on markets' perceptions of the state of the economy, so even a modest upturn would be a significant development.\"</p><p><strong>* US APRIL HOUSING STARTS: </strong>Also put in an upside beat, rising to 1.235mln, with decent internals (including sing family starts); building permits also beat with the rise in multi-family permits more than offsetting declines in single-family permits. The pace of new residential construction has picked up alongside improving buying conditions, however starts remain below last year’s level, Wells Fargo said.</p><p><strong>* US WEEKLY INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Printed 212k vs 228k prior, undershooting the consensus 220k. The data snapped a run of three consecutive higher readings, and analysts said claims were reverting back to the trend rate.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>US President Trump reiterated today that he hopes the US does not go to war with Iran, previous reports suggest there was opposing view within the administration with some of the hawks pushing for increased US presence in the region. The stance was later confirmed by the NYT who reported Trump telling Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan in the Situation Room that he does not want to go to war with Iran. “The risks of a Middle East military confrontation are rising sharply amid twin attacks on energy assets in the Gulf and the US decision to order an evacuation of non-essential personnel from the US Embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Erbil,” RBC’s analysts summarised recent events. A fresh attack from the Saudi-led coalition on the Yemeni capital of Sanaa did not do anything to reduce these risks.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>The Mexican central bank unanimously left rates at 8.25%, as expected, citing inflation edging higher in recent months while the economy is stuttering. There were no revisions to its balance of risks to growth and inflation (inflation risks skewed to the upside in the environment of high uncertainty – risks identified again: MXN, rise of minimum wage, inflation expectations) and is a key reminder to markets that they should be cautious about pricing in rate cuts, Pantheon said. Meanwhile, on Growth, risks are to the downside, and the policymakers added that the outlook has become more uncertain. The Board said it will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will pay attention to exchange rate pass-through, Fed policy, and the output gap, as usual. “Overall, we still think that Banxico will keep interest rates on hold over the coming meetings as inflation will remain too high for comfort,” Pantheon says, “But policymakers will start to lay the ground for rate cuts in Q4, as the disinflation trend will resume.” The consultancy notes that demand-related inflation pressures are very limited, the economy weakened in Q1 and the MXN has remained under control, despite many domestic and external threats. “All these factors, coupled with a dovish Fed, will allow Banxico to cut rates,” Pantheon writes, “We assume favourable external conditions, including USMCA ratification and market-friendly domestic policy stance from AMLO.”</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) SETTLES $0.85 HIGHER AT $62.87/BBL, BRENT (N9) SETTLES $0.85 HIGHER AT $72.62/BBL.</strong> The crude complex continued to rally on Thursday, catching a tailwind again from geopolitical risk and growing risk appetite. As the US session kicked off, equity markets did too, rising smoothly from the equity open, this sentiment helped push cyclical/risk assets higher such as oil, whilst pushing Treasury yields higher. Bulls are also still benefitting from tensions in the Middle East, where the market is pricing a risk premium over supply concerns. Analysts at PVM noted, “Earlier this morning, a Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on the Yemeni capital city of Sanaa and is spurring a bout of fresh buying.” Market participants will be paying close attention to see if the dispute with Iran can be settled (or somewhat diminished) via diplomacy, rather than conflict, which would ease concerns. One of which is the risk of Iran halting shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, however analysts at RBC take the view, “While the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain means Iran is highly unlikely to close Straits of Hormuz, Iran does have the ability to stage one-off attacks on vessels and leverage both its proxies and asymmetric capabilities.” Looking ahead to this weekend’s JMMC meeting, Iraq oil minister Alluaibi said oil markets and current prices are stable, with no acute volatility; adding that the weekend's JMMC meeting will assess the commitment of OPEC/OPEC+ to production cuts, saying it's too early to predict OPEC decision; if the meeting reveals an eagerness to break away from the committed cuts, this could give way to downside for the market.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.9% AT 2876, NASDAQ-100 1% AT 7580, DOW JONES 0.8% AT 25863, SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary 1%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.8%, Energy&nbsp; 0.4%, Financials&nbsp; 1.1%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.8%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.9%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1%, Materials&nbsp; 1.3%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.6%</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECFICS: </strong>The Trump administration’s decision&nbsp;to ban US telecommunications companies from using foreign equipment that would pose a threat to national security weighed heavily on a number of tech names with close ties to Chinese technology companies such as Huawei. Qualcom (QCOM), Xilinx (XLNX), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Micron Technologies (MU), Analog Devices (ADI) and IPG Photonics Corp (IPGP)&nbsp;all finished firmly in the red.&nbsp;Cisco Systems (CSCO), however, shrugged off US/China trade related concerns, moving higher premarket after posting strong earnings; the chipmaker beating expectations on both top and bottom lines whilst revising Q4 guidance higher, a revision which the co said does take into account the impact of tariffs. Walmart (WMT) also&nbsp;moved higher&nbsp;after posting strong earnings. These strong earnings, in addition to strong housing data, helped propel Wall Street to a third consecutive day of gains, in which large tech names were some of the key beneficiaries. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and PayPal (PYPL)&nbsp;all moved higher. Amazon (AMZN)&nbsp;also moved higher, with the share price finding additional support form news the tech giant would introduce a new model of its Fire device aimed at children. Banking names including, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C),&nbsp;where unfazed&nbsp;after the EU issued fines to multiple firms in relation to involvement in spot foreign exchange cartels. Tesla (TSLA)&nbsp;shares were under pressure after&nbsp;the electric automaker announced it will update its battery software following the spontaneous combustion of another of its Model S vehicles, whilst also facing news that Asset Manager T. Rowe Price had been selling its shares. Healthcare, Pharma and Biotech names also participated in the wider rally, with the exception of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR),&nbsp;who sunk&nbsp;on a reduction in Sabby Managements 13-F filing.&nbsp;Boeing (BA) caught a bid later in the session on the back of it announcing it had completed a 737 MAX software update.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 8 TICKS LOWER AT 124-13+.</strong> At settlement, the curve had bear-flattened, though in early trade, there was a bid in the complex after news that Trump was going to take action on Huawei. The tough talk out of China’s MOFCOM also gave support to the complex in the European morning. However, after the European cash open, Treasury yields began to rise, and were booted higher further after a decent slate of US data. After that data, the drift has generally been horizontal.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO:</strong> The Mexican central bank unanimously left rates at 8.25%, as expected, citing inflation edging higher in recent months while the economy is stuttering. There were no revisions to its balance of risks to growth and inflation (inflation risks skewed to the upside in the environment of high uncertainty – risks identified again: MXN, rise of minimum wage, inflation expectations) and is a key reminder to markets that they should be cautious about pricing in rate cuts, Pantheon said. Meanwhile, on Growth, risks are to the downside, and the policymakers added that the outlook has become more uncertain. The Board said it will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will pay attention to exchange rate pass-through, Fed policy, and the output gap, as usual. “Overall, we still think that Banxico will keep interest rates on hold over the coming meetings as inflation will remain too high for comfort,” Pantheon says, “But policymakers will start to lay the ground for rate cuts in Q4, as the disinflation trend will resume.” The consultancy notes that demand-related inflation pressures are very limited, the economy weakened in Q1 and the MXN has remained under control, despite many domestic and external threats. “All these factors, coupled with a dovish Fed, will allow Banxico to cut rates,” Pantheon writes, “We assume favourable external conditions, including USMCA ratification and market-friendly domestic policy stance from AMLO.”</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> A more constructive risk tone has seen havens on the defensive, with <strong>JPY</strong> (flirts with 110.00), <strong>CHF</strong> (above 1.01 vs the USD), <strong>XAU</strong> (breaks through 1292 to the downside) all off, while Treasury yields are higher, though the curve has bear-flattened. Ultimately, the <strong>USD</strong> is consolidating near the top-end of its weekly range (around 97.85) after a solid Philly Fed report added to the optimism following Wednesday's upbeat Empire State survey, while housing data also supported the Buck. The <strong>EUR</strong> was taking its cue more from US/German yield spreads widening, rather than the narrowing of the Bund/BTP spread, and trades near lows around 1.1170 heading into APAC trade. The <strong>AUD</strong> is flat as US traders got to their desks, but is near LOD heading into Asia trade (sub 0.69) after overnight jobs data bolstered the case for looser RBA policy. <strong>EMFX</strong> also does not appear to be participating in the better risk sentiment, while some idiosyncratic factors are also weighing (particularly for the <strong>BRL</strong>), although the <strong>RUB</strong> is faring better as crude prices are up (<strong>NOK</strong> also firmer). The <strong>MXN</strong> weakened after Banxico rate decision. <strong>GBP</strong> remains a function of political headlines, and with PM May heading towards the exit, Brexiteers lead the race to become new leader, and GBP trades sub-1.28. <strong>CNH</strong> rose to highs in the latter part of US trade (HOD was above 6.93), perhaps adding some caution to risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> The Aussie fell after the jobless rate ticked up. The jobs data showed better than expected headline at +28k, with the Y/Y rate of job growth rising to the best since June 2018 at 2.6%. However, having been stable at 5.0% for several months, the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.2%, and underutilisation jumped to 13.7% from 13.0% (highest since June 2018), though participation also rose back to an equal record high at 65.8%. UBS said that overall, the labour market is worse than the RBA's repeated view that it \"remains strong\"; while jobs growth remains solid, unemployment is now trending up, and the broader underutilisation rate (measuring spare capacity) has increased by even more, clearly meeting the RBA's key 'scenario' to cut rates, the bank believes.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The Japanese government is mulling downgrading its assessment of the economy next week, Reuters reported, as the US/China trade war exacts its toll on Japanese exports and factory output, according to a government source; the move might fuel speculation that Japan may delay a planned hike in its sales tax for the third time (planned for October). Any decision to delay the tax would likely need to e made before Upper House elections in the summer. The BOJ's next Tankan survey (released 1 July) will offer clues as to whether the sales tax hike would likely be delayed again.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> The PBOC issued 3-month and one-year bills in HK overnight at higher rates than in February. Analysts said that by selling the bills in Hong Kong, rather than the mainland, the PBOC is signalling a tougher stance on yuan control, which could lead to tighter liquidity conditions that could end up buoying the yuan currency.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> Fitch ratings gave a negative assessment on the state of fiscal reform, weighing on the BRL. The CRA said that the pension reform agenda was positive, however, the congressional division and uncertainty of the timing of passing the reforms is a problem. Fitch also said that pension reforms were not sufficient to stabilise the nation's public debt, and subsequently, trigger any ratings upgrade. Fitch also noted that domestic growth has failed to take off; this message was re-emphasized after a number of desks again cut their 2019 growth forecasts for Brazil. The Brazil central bank chief himself said that the global economic environment was challenging, and that the slowdown in late 2018 had spilled over into 2019, suggesting that the economy contracted in Q1. Campos Neto also said that inflation risks were symmetric, though a high degree of slack could lead to a lower rate path than previously expected.</p>",

As the US session kicked off, equity markets did too, rising smoothly from the equity open, this sentiment helped push cyclical/risk assets higher such as oil, whilst pushing Treasury yields higher. Bulls are also still benefitting from tensions in the Middle East, where the market is pricing a risk premium over supply concerns. Analysts at PVM noted, “Earlier this morning, a Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on the Yemeni capital city of Sanaa and is spurring a bout of fresh buying.” Market participants will be paying close attention to see if the dispute with Iran can be settled (or somewhat diminished) via diplomacy, rather than conflict, which would ease concerns. One of which is the risk of Iran halting shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, however analysts at RBC take the view, “While the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain means Iran is highly unlikely to close Straits of Hormuz, Iran does have the ability to stage one-off attacks on vessels and leverage both its proxies and asymmetric capabilities.” Looking ahead to this weekend’s JMMC meeting, Iraq oil minister Alluaibi said oil markets and current prices are stable, with no acute volatility; adding that the weekend's JMMC meeting will assess the commitment of OPEC/OPEC+ to production cuts, saying it's too early to predict OPEC decision; if the meeting reveals an eagerness to break away from the committed cuts, this could give way to downside for the market.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is now broadly firmer vs its major rivals, and another encouraging regional manufacturing survey has helped the Buck rebound further from recent lows after little initial reaction to US housing data beats. Consequently, the index has breached resistance ahead of 98.000 and the May high (98.102) at 97.747 having just held above the 30 DMA earlier, and if the DXY maintains its recovery momentum then the ytd peak (97.330) could be targeted.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major laggards with independent weights to compound the aforementioned Buck bounce in the form of heightened Brexit angst and pressure on UK PM May to name her departure date, while Aussie jobs data has lifted RBA rate cut prospects for the June policy meeting. Cable has now seriously tested the resolve of bids around the 1.2800 handle and support ahead of the mid-February low (1.2773) when there was little sign of any Valentine’s Day love for the Pound, but Sterling held up better vs the single currency that suffered another Italian-related blow – more on this to come. Meanwhile, a decline in full time workers and uptick in the unemployment rate raised easing expectations for next month, including so called RBA watcher McCrann, with Aud/Usd down below 0.6900 at one stage and heading back that way after a rebound tailed off around 0.6933.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>Another improvement in overall risk sentiment, as the tide continues to turn has seen the Yen lose safe-haven premium again and retreat from 109.34 to 109.90 vs the Usd, while the Euro lost grip of 1.1200 after Wednesday’s comeback on potentially positive auto tariff news in wake of more and arguably the most aggressive fiscal defiance from Italian Deputy PM Salvini. Eur/Usd recoiled to 1.1173 and closer to mtd lows (1.1135) as he pledged to rip up all EU rules that are butchering his country if his Party performs well at the forthcoming EU elections.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also on the backfoot against the Usd as the Franc slipped through 1.0100 and Kiwi waned alongside its antipodean peer from just above 0.6580 towards 0.6650 and overnight lows a few pips below.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Another choppy session for the Loonie, albeit within a 1.3400-50 range vs its US rival as a firmer rebound in oil prices and positive vibes on the USMCA metals tariff front helped the Cad evade bearish impulses from the aforementioned upbeat US macro releases vs decent Canadian manufacturing sales data and latest diplomatic incident between Canada and the US.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Real and Lira lamented relatively downbeat ratings reviews from Fitch and Moody’s in contrast to the Rand that continued to outperform in wake of the SA election results and awaiting President Ramaphosa’s latest reform plan. Indeed, Usd/Brl rebounded over 4.0000 and Usd/Try reclaimed 6.0000 vs Usd/Zar holding steady within a 14.2650-1315 range.</p>",

Sectors are mixed with outperformance in material names (amidst rising base metal prices) whilst consumer discretionary lags as EU auto names pare back some of yesterday’s tariff-spurred gains. In terms of individual movers, Thyssenkrupp (+6.5%) shares rose to the top of the DAX after reports that Finland’s Kone (+3.8%) are exploring the viability of a bid for Thyssenkrupp’s EUR 14bln elevator division. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook (-18.4%) shares opened lower by over 20% after posting a Q1 pre-tax loss of EUR 1.465bln which came alongside a warning that “challenging” trading over the peak summer season would impact FY earnings, although the Co. did note that they have received multiple bids for all and parts of the group airline. Finally, Ubisoft (-12.4%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 despite posting record sales figures, after a delay to its open-world game “Skull &amp; Bones” into the next FY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>USD - The Dollar is holding above Wednesday’s post-US data lows, but stands narrowly mixed vs G10 counterparts as the US-China trade dispute continues via recriminations over the cause of the derailment in talks that has sparked another round of reciprocal tariffs. However, the DXY is stuck in a narrow band either side of the 97.500 mark that has been pivotal for a while, and very close to the 30 DMA (94.428) between 97.565-438.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NZD/EUR/CAD/JPY/AUD/CHF - All marginally firmer vs the Greenback, with the Kiwi outperforming or clawing back more losses than other so be precise from sub-0.6550 levels to circa 0.6580. Meanwhile, the single currency is holding above 1.1200 after reclaiming big figure+ status yesterday on the EU auto tax reprieve, but unable to breach the 30 DMA (1.1222) convincingly amidst increasingly dovish ECB market expectations and another potential clash between Italy and the EU on budget policy intentions. The Loonie has also rebounded from recent lows and a post-Canadian CPI dip to test resistance ahead of 1.3400 with some positive momentum coming from reports that the Canada, Mexico and the US are close to clinching a deal on steel tariffs (Peso paring losses as well as Usd/Mxn eyes 19.0000). Usd/Jpy continues to straddle 109.50 as the Yen retains a safe-haven bid, but also contends with more decent option expiry interest (1.55 bn from 109.15 to 109.25 and 2.2 bn between 109.40-55). Elsewhere, the Aussie has recovered from its latest slump in wake of more weak data on balance (labour report) and a dip through 0.6900 stops with the aid of underlying bids/short covering, and Aud/Usd has now absorbed supply said to be sitting around 0.6910 and above to trade back up around 0.6933. Lastly, funding for a proposed acquisition has been touted as a factor behind recent Franc strength, but Usd/Chf has bounced towards 1.0100 from a few pips above 1.0050 and Eur/Chf has crossed over 1.1300 again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GBP - Brexit and related UK political uncertainty is still haunting Sterling along with other global and geopolitical risk, with Cable retreating a tad further towards 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp inching close to 0.8750 as PM May meets the 1922 group in just under an hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EM - The Rand is showing a degree of resilience in the face of somewhat negative reviews from Moody’s on SA’s credit outlook with Usd/Zar hovering at the lower end of 14.2650-1525 trading parameters and perhaps being drawn or attracted to an unusually large expiry at the 14.0000 strike (1.365 bn).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Australian Employment Change (Apr) 28.4k vs. Exp. 14.0k (Prev. 25.7k).

(Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The latest advance in debt futures and decline in cash yields has stalled even though remarks from China show little sign of easing in trade tensions with the US, and knowledge about a meeting in Beijing to try and restore relations. 10 year benchmarks have all eased back from best levels towards intraday lows after Bunds faded at 167.27, Gilts at 129.03 and US Treasuries at 124-27, with the notable exception of Spanish Bonos that saw decent buying interest on their way up to a 153.31 high and have only drifted back a few ticks since. Ahead, another potential Brexit game-changer as UK PM May meets the 1922 mob at 11.30BST and then a raft of US data before more global Central Bank speakers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>A positive session thus far for WTI (+0.7%) and Brent (+0.5%) futures as tensions in the Middle East drift back into focus. The former remains above USD 62.00/bbl and in close proximity to USD 62.50/bbl whilst its Brent counterpart floats comfortably above the USD 72.00/bbl mark. On the Iranian front, ship tracking data showed that a tanker carrying Iranian oil (in violation with US sanctions) has unloaded its cargo of almost 130k tonnes of oil near Zhousan, in China. Iran will remain a focus as the JMMC convene this weekend in Jeddah, with ministers expected to discuss whether the supply gap from Iranian sanctions will need to be filled, and hence whether the output curb deal will need to be extended until the end of the year.&nbsp; In terms of technicals, analysts at PVM highlight resistance at 63.09 (21 DMA) in WTI and 72.60 in Brent (short-term DMA) which they believe will be tested today given the optimism emanating from Trump’s decision to delay EU auto tariffs, progress regarding the Canadian and Mexican aluminium and steel tariffs and concerns of supply disruptions from Middle Eastern tensions. Looking at metals, gold remains choppy below the 1300/oz level and flirts with its 100 DMA at 1296.82 ahead of its 50 DMA (1291.69). Elsewhere, copper prices are poised to notch a third day of gains amid a weakening buck and optimism surrounding Trump’s auto tariff delays with the red metal now back above 2.75/lb ahead of its 200 DMA at 2.7604.</p><p>Iraq oil Ministry reportedly denied that ExonnMobil workers are to evacuate from work sites in Iraqi territory.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equities are relatively uneventful [Eurostoxx 50 +0.1%] following on from a mostly positive lead in Asia. Sectors are mixed with outperformance in material names (amidst rising base metal prices) whilst consumer discretionary lags as EU auto names pare back some of yesterday’s tariff-spurred gains. In terms of individual movers, Thyssenkrupp (+7.1%) shares rose to the top of the DAX after reports that Finland’s Kone (+3.8%) are exploring the viability of a bid for Thyssenkrupp’s EUR 14bln elevator division. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook (-15.8%) shares opened lower by over 20% after posting a Q1 pre-tax loss of EUR 1.465bln which came alongside a warning that “challenging” trading over the peak summer season would impact FY earnings, although the Co. did note that they have received multiple bids for all and parts of the group airline. Finally, Ubisoft (-13.6%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 despite posting record sales figures, after a delay to its open-world game “Skull &amp; Bones” into the next FY.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar is holding above Wednesday’s post-US data lows, but stands narrowly mixed vs G10 counterparts as the US-China trade dispute continues via recriminations over the cause of the derailment in talks that has sparked another round of reciprocal tariffs. However, the DXY is stuck in a narrow band either side of the 97.500 mark that has been pivotal for a while, and very close to the 30 DMA (94.428) between 97.565-438.</p><p>NZD/EUR/CAD/JPY/AUD/CHF - All marginally firmer vs the Greenback, with the Kiwi outperforming or clawing back more losses than other so be precise from sub-0.6550 levels to circa 0.6580. Meanwhile, the single currency is holding above 1.1200 after reclaiming big figure+ status yesterday on the EU auto tax reprieve, but unable to breach the 30 DMA (1.1222) convincingly amidst increasingly dovish ECB market expectations and another potential clash between Italy and the EU on budget policy intentions. The Loonie has also rebounded from recent lows and a post-Canadian CPI dip to test resistance ahead of 1.3400 with some positive momentum coming from reports that the Canada, Mexico and the US are close to clinching a deal on steel tariffs (Peso paring losses as well as Usd/Mxn eyes 19.0000). Usd/Jpy continues to straddle 109.50 as the Yen retains a safe-haven bid, but also contends with more decent option expiry interest (1.55 bn from 109.15 to 109.25 and 2.2 bn between 109.40-55). Elsewhere, the Aussie has recovered from its latest slump in wake of more weak data on balance (labour report) and a dip through 0.6900 stops with the aid of underlying bids/short covering, and Aud/Usd has now absorbed supply said to be sitting around 0.6910 and above to trade back up around 0.6933. Lastly, funding for a proposed acquisition has been touted as a factor behind recent Franc strength, but Usd/Chf has bounced towards 1.0100 from a few pips above 1.0050 and Eur/Chf has crossed over 1.1300 again.</p><p>GBP - Brexit and related UK political uncertainty is still haunting Sterling along with other global and geopolitical risk, with Cable retreating a tad further towards 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp inching close to 0.8750 as PM May meets the 1922 group in just under an hour.</p><p>EM - The Rand is showing a degree of resilience in the face of somewhat negative reviews from Moody’s on SA’s credit outlook with Usd/Zar hovering at the lower end of 14.2650-1525 trading parameters and perhaps being drawn or attracted to an unusually large expiry at the 14.0000 strike (1.365 bn).</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>The latest advance in debt futures and decline in cash yields has stalled even though remarks from China show little sign of easing in trade tensions with the US, and knowledge about a meeting in Beijing to try and restore relations. 10 year benchmarks have all eased back from best levels towards intraday lows after Bunds faded at 167.27, Gilts at 129.03 and US Treasuries at 124-27, with the notable exception of Spanish Bonos that saw decent buying interest on their way up to a 153.31 high and have only drifted back a few ticks since. Ahead, another potential Brexit game-changer as UK PM May meets the 1922 mob at 11.30BST and then a raft of US data before more global Central Bank speakers.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>A positive session thus far for WTI (+0.5%) and Brent (+0.3%) futures as tensions in the Middle East drift back into focus. The former remains above USD 62.00/bbl and in close proximity to USD 62.50/bbl whilst its Brent counterpart floats comfortably above the USD 72.00/bbl mark. On the Iranian front, ship tracking data showed that a tanker carrying Iranian oil (in violation with US sanctions) has unloaded its cargo of almost 130k tonnes of oil near Zhousan, in China. Iran will remain a focus as the JMMC convene this weekend in Jeddah, with ministers expected to discuss whether the supply gap from Iranian sanctions will need to be filled, and hence whether the output curb deal will need to be extended until the end of the year.&nbsp; In terms of technicals, analysts at PVM highlight resistance at 63.09 (21 DMA) in WTI and 72.60 in Brent (short-term DMA) which they believe will be tested today given the optimism emanating from Trump’s decision to delay EU auto tariffs, progress regarding the Canadian and Mexican aluminium and steel tariffs and concerns of supply disruptions from Middle Eastern tensions. Looking at metals, gold remains choppy below the 1300/oz level and flirts with its 100 DMA at 1296.82 ahead of its 50 DMA (1291.69). Elsewhere, copper prices are poised to notch a third day of gains amid a weakening buck and optimism surrounding Trump’s auto tariff delays with the red metal now back above 2.75/lb ahead of its 200 DMA at 2.7604.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DXY remained subdued around the 97.50 level following the prior day’s losses which was largely due to the fallout from a stronger EUR/USD on the reports of President Trump’s auto tariff delay.

USD/JPY was choppy around 109.50 with price action contained by several nearby large option expiries for today’s New York cut, while antipodeans softened and AUD/USD briefly declined to its lowest level since the start of January after mixed jobs data in which Employment Change topped estimates but was solely fuelled by Part-Time jobs, and the Unemployment Rate increased to 5.2% from a prior revised 5.1% which added to the case for future RBA rate cuts.

This lifted <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures above the USD 62.00/bbl level, while a surprise build in DoE crude inventories did little to dent the gains as they were less than the prior day’s API build.

Furthermore, it added there are serious problems including Iran's behaviour although it has not concluded investigation on oil tanker attacks. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>US</p><p>Trade sentiment was again the driving factor for Treasury price moves on Wednesday. In early trade, however, the T-Note was again taking its cue from EGB's, where the Bund/BTP spread widened as participants digested comments from the Italian Deputy PM Salvini, who stated that EU deficit rules can be breached if measures would support growth (Setting up another conflict with both his coalition partners, as well as the EU). But since US traders got to their desks, the T-Note essentially became more horizontal (continuing to rise until news broke that Trump had pushed-back the decision on imposing auto tariffs on imports of EU vehicles, but then seeing modest negative ticks). At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch wider/unchanged. US T-notes (M9) futures settled 11 ticks higher at 124-21+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawk)</strong> said it makes sense for the Fed to remain patient on rates and that inflation weakness is likely transitory.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mixed as blue-chip earnings and the US blacklisting of Huawei as well as 70 of its affiliates overshadowed the positive lead from Wall St, where sentiment was underpinned by reports that President Trump plans to delay the decision on tariffs for auto imports by up to 6-months. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were mixed in which the commodity-related sectors led the intraday recovery in Australia and as a higher Unemployment Rate stoked calls for an RBA rate cut, while Tokyo trade was pressured by disappointing earnings including Japan’s megabanks Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) were initially subdued with underperformance seen in tech and telecoms following US President Trump’s national emergency declaration on foreign companies posing threats to US telecommunications, although strength in property names after firmer Chinese House Price data helped reverse the losses. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially supported as they tracked recent upside in T-notes and amid weakness in Tokyo stocks, although gains were capped after the 5-year JGB auction results were relatively inline with the previous albeit with a weaker b/c.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as blue-chip earnings and the US blacklisting of Huawei and 70 of its affiliates overshadow the positive lead from Wall St, where sentiment was underpinned by reports that President Trump plans to delay the decision on tariffs for EU auto imports by up to 6-months. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are mixed with the commodity-related sectors front-running the intraday recovery in Australia and as a higher Unemployment Rate stokes calls for an RBA rate cut, while Tokyo trade is pressured by disappointing earnings including Japan’s megabanks Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are subdued with underperformance seen in tech and telecoms following US President Trump’s national emergency declaration on foreign companies posing threats to US telecommunications, although strength in property names after firmer Chinese House Price data has helped reverse some of the weakness.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY remains subdued around the 97.50 level following the prior day’s losses which was largely due to the fallout from a stronger EUR/USD on the reports of President Trump’s EU auto tariff delay. Meanwhile, GBP/USD languishes firmly below the 1.2900 handle and at 3-month lows ahead of PM May’s day of reckoning with the 1922 Committee in which some expect her to be gone by next month, while some also anticipate cross-party talks could collapse as early as today. USD/JPY is choppy around 109.50 with price action contained by several nearby large option expiries for today’s New York cut, while antipodeans are softer as AUD/USD briefly declined to its lowest level since the start of January after mixed jobs data in which Employment Change topped estimates but was solely fuelled by Part-Time jobs and the Unemployment Rate increased to 5.2% from a prior revised 5.1%, which adds to the case for future RBA rate cuts.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track recent gains in T-notes and amid weakness in Tokyo stocks, while focus turns to the upcoming 5-year auction later.</p>",
