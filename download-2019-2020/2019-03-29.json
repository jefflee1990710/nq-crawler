In an interview with CNBC, Kudlow seemed to intimate that these were Trump’s views.<strong> </strong>Policymakers have been suggesting that the recent inversion of the 3m/10yr curve is not a harbinger of a future recession. Indeed, many have offered the argument that other factors might be in play, such as the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, which distorts the signal presented by the yield curve. That argument was alluded to by <strong>Fed’s Quarles (voter)</strong> and <strong>Kaplan (non-voter)</strong> on Friday, echoing what we have recently heard from the likes of the <strong>Fed’s Williams (voter) and Daly (non-voter)</strong>. While policymakers are genuinely confident that the US economy is in good shape, <strong>Fed’s Kashkari (non-voter)</strong> suggested that he now sees elevated chances of a recession, even though it is not his base case. Analysts have noted that, with the Fed likely to tolerate an overshoot in inflation, the focus of data will be on the growth and activity metrics (PMIs and ISM next week could give us some insight, while labour market metrics will also be eyed, making next week’s payrolls report, once again, one of the main features of the week).</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>After sentiment was buoyed in the early European morning by positive trade talk comments by Treasury secretary Mnuchin, there were scant updates from the Far-East besides a cursory reference made by Xinhua stating that China-US trade talks have made “new” progress. This renewed positivity came after yesterday nights good vibes from the Beijing talks, with talks set to resume in Washington on Monday. Expectations were tempered marginally, however, after Hu Xijin of the China Global Times stated that the Chinese delegation is more cautious on its optimism than the US. More downside risk was also added by the US President who stated that he may close the US-Mexico border and stop trade if the Central American country don’t stop illegal immigration, which saw weakness in the MXN on renewed American tensions.</p><p><strong>* US PERSONAL INCOME, SPENDING, PCE: </strong>Friday’s personal income &amp; spending data release was abnormal due to the overhang from the government shutdown, the report combined January’s income and spending, and gave just the income section for February. February personal income rose by +0.2%, up from January’s -0.1% fall, but shy of the expected +0.3%. The core PCE index for January showed an increase of 0.1%, also beneath the expected 0.2% which would have been unchanged from December; the PCE deflator missed expectations too and printed a fall of -0.1%, “Both measures indicate sub-2% annual inflation and give the Fed more reason to pause,” analysts at Wells Fargo Economics comment, making their case for the figures complementing the weaker domestic demand narrative spawned from this week’s export/import data, which showed falling imports. Following the ominous -0.6% nosedive in consumer spending in December, expectations were set for a modest reversal at +0.3% in January, however spending grew by a meagre +0.1%, hinting that December’s data wasn’t necessarily a fluke as some had hypothesised. Wells’ analysts provide the succinct summary, “the consumer is losing momentum.”</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN GDP:</strong> Canadian monthly GDP rose by more than expected in January (0.3% MM vs 0.0% exp.), with ten of the eleven major industrial sectors seeing expansion. On the other side of the coin, mining and O&amp;G extraction contracted, given the Government-mandated production cuts in Alberta. \"With a strong rebound in January GDP, Q1-2019 nowcast is at 1.09% Q/Q SAAR,\" Scotiabank's analysts said. \"The monthly pattern in industry-level GDP underlying this nowcast is -0.1% and +0.1% in February and March. Barring negative surprises in February and March, Q1-2019 should support the Bank of Canada in resuming rate hikes some time this year.\"</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES:</strong> 667k reported vs 620k expected. Housing data is seen improving as ease from highs seen in Q4. \"New home sales have been tracking the mortgage applications data with a lag of about three months, and these data continue that pattern,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics writes. \"The mortgage data point to broadly steady next few months.\" The economic consultancy notes that new home sales have outperformed existing sales over the last year, \"perhaps because a much smaller proportion of new sales take place in the high-tax states of the north east and elsewhere,£ Pantheon believes, adding that \"the capping of state and local tax deductions last year appears to have caused chaos in the existing home market in these areas, on a big enough scale to depress the national numbers quite sharply.\" Pantheon adds that this \"triggered a market narrative that housing is in real trouble, but that view clearly is contradicted by the new home sales numbers.\" The consultancy expects housing investment to make a positive contribution to Q2 GDP numbers, perhaps even Q1 too.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK MPs voted by a margin of 58 (344 vs 286) to reject PM May’s Withdrawal Agreement. In light of the rejection, the EU exit date becomes 12 April (vs 23 May, should it have been accepted). European Council President Tusk called an emergency EU summit on 10 April in light of the rejection, with the UK needing to explain its Brexit Plan B before 8 April, so leaders have time to give consideration (analysts are of the view that the EU would likely grant an extension to the Brexit process, but will want to see the UK present a concrete plan and participate in EU elections). A spokesperson said that it was almost certain the UK would now have to participate in the European election on 23-26 May. Attention shifts to Monday, where further indicative votes are expected, and UK PM May might have to re-think some of her red lines in order to bring some consensus among lawmakers, so she can take unified position to the EU in order to request the extension. Elsewhere, there has been some suggestion that the rejection opens the possibility of a general election; however, an MV4 looks more likely to proceed that, where a No. 10 source said on Friday evening in London that Downing Street is indeed planning to bring UK PM May's deal back to the HoC again next week, and is threatening an election, again, if it cannot secure a majority. Capital Economics says one of four things must happen: either May's deal is passed, the UK will have left the EU without a deal, the UK will have decided to stay in the EU, or another delay to the Brexit process will have been agreed.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 0.84 HIGHER AT USD 60.14/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLES USD 0.57 HIGHER AT USD 68.39/BBL. </strong>The constructive risk environment, on the back of further trader optimism, saw crude markets setting fresh YTD highs to end the week and quarter. Positive comments out of the Sino-US trade talks in the Asian and European session saw prices rallying into the US equity open, before paring back some of gains as the day progressed with some disappointing US personal income and spending data lurking in the backdrop. Citi's energy analysts said \"the market is also gaining supportive press coverage, as newswire coverage touts what will be the largest quarterly rise since 2009, with OPEC+ production cuts and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela cited as the bullish fundamental lever.\" Other tailwinds included: Russian Energy Minister Novak denying reports from earlier in the week that Russia would only agree to a three-month extension of supply curbs, which had previously spooked the market; Barclay's forecasting prices to move higher in Q2, with Brent averaging at USD 73/bbl and WTI USD 65/bbl. On the other hand, following Venezuela’s blackout this week, there were signs production was coming back online with news that the Jose oil export terminal had resumed operations. US Baker Hughes Rig Count showed rigs cutting for the sixth consecutive week and the data shows drillers have cut the most rigs in a quarter since 2016, with oil rigs -8 at 816, natgas rigs -2 at 190, total rigs -10 at 1006 for the recent week.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.67% at 2834, NDX +0.80% at 7379, DJI +0.82% at 25929. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.16%, Materials +0.75%, Industrials +1.01%, Cons Discretionary +0.52%, Cons Staples +0.69%, Healthcare +1.18%, Financials +0.32%, Tech +0.98%, Telecoms +0.29%, Utilities +0.60%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>DowDuPont (DWDP) traded near the bottom of the Dow on Friday as it guided its earnings and revenue lower due to flooding impact. Restoration Hardware (RH) dived after an abysmal FY profit forecast. 3M (MMM) faced headwinds on a negative mention by JPMorgan’s industrials analyst Tulsa. BlackBerry (BB) surged after reporting its earnings report. Following Thursday’s session seeing all-time highs for Lululemon (LULU), the stock pared back some of the move today as two top stake holders cut their positions. Gilead (GILD) opened higher on reporting its arthritis drug had met its primary endpoint. Celgene (CELG) caught a bid after independent merger review firm ISS gave its approval for it to be acquired by Bristol-Myers (BMY), which consequentially dipped lower. Carmax (KMX) and Science Applications International (SAIC) surged on an earnings beat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 9 TICKS LOWER AT 124-07. </strong>At settlement, major curve spreads had narrowed by between 1bps (2s5s) and 4bps (2s30s). Profit taking was cited in APAC trade, while the trade optimism chestnut was also cited. An attempt at a move higher in European trade ran out of steam, but did see some upside after PCE data was released (deflator saw the first decline since March 2017). There was also demand inspired by Brexit uncertainty, as well US President Trump firing barbs at Mexico on Twitter, and then subsequently in remarks. The curve remained flatter into the close, and traders will be focussed on Monday’s liquidity impact from SOMA day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling has been subjected to another wild Brexit related ride within relatively wide ranges of 1.3270-1.2976 in Cable and 0.8650-0.8482 for Eur/Gbp, and looks set to end the week under more intense pressure following the latest Parliament rejection of the WA (which was tabled again without the PD to satisfy the criteria preventing the same motion being presented multiple times). This follows IVs on 8 alternative strategies on Wednesday that failed to a produce a majority backing for any of the amendments, and means the UK is heading for an EU exit on April 12 without any deal or different plan to put before Brussels and argue the case for a further A 50 extension to May 22. Predictably, pressure on PM May to stand down has ramped up amidst GE speculation, but at this point it seems more IVs will take place next week and MV4 is also a possibility. For more please check out our headline feed.</p><p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The broad Dollar and index are on course to end or at least break a losing streak with net gains on the week, partly due to currency losses elsewhere, a rebound in US Treasury yields amidst a degree of normalisation along the curve from ultra-low and fairly deeply inverted levels. However, the DXY has topped out (for now) at 97.345 vs 96.654 at the start of the week and a 96.404 low after a weak Chicago PMI continued the run of mostly softer than forecast US macro releases.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency has lost ground vs the Usd and Chf, in sympathy with the Pound to an extent, and after kicking off the week on the front foot as the latest German Ifo survey beat on all counts, including upward revisions to the previous month. Eur/Usd is currently just above lows only a few pips away from 1.1200 vs 1.1330 or so at one stage, while Eur/Chf is close to the base of 1.1255-1.1163 parameters following more benign Eurozone inflation data, dovish ECB rhetoric on balance and talk of tiered deposits ahead of TLTRO3.</p><p><strong>* CAD/NZD/AUD: </strong>All ending Friday’s EU session firmer vs their US rival, with the Loonie finding support via encouraging Canadian GDP data that countered a wider trade deficit yesterday, and firmer oil prices. In fact, Usd/Cad is just off a fresh low for the week around 1.3340 after filing bids at 1.3350 vs 1.3450 at the other extreme, and with some additional impetus from China via the lifting of some Canola import restrictions. The Kiwi and Aussie both drew encouragement from reports that more progress was made between the US and China at the latest round of trade negotiations and for the former also improved ANZ consumer sentiment, but Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd are still rooted closer to the bases of 0.6924-0.6772 and 0.7145-0.7062 respective bands following an unexpectedly dovish twist from the RBNZ (that now sees more chance of the OCR being lowered vs 50-50 between an ease or hike previously), and risks of the RBA following suit next week. Note, however, JPM is now looking for the RBNZ to cut rates twice in May and June, and the Aud/Nzd cross has rebounded from sub-1.0300 to 1.0400+ in response.</p><p><strong>* JPY/CHF:</strong> The Jpy has been largely hostage to general swings in risk sentiment, UST yields and related Greenback moves as the BoJ stays in full-on easing mode and domestic data remains soft. However, some big option expiries, tech levels and orders for Japanese FY end amidst month and Q1 positioning has also impacted the headline pair plus Jpy crosses. Usd/Jpy has climbed from lows of 109.70 towards 111.00, but is still capped ahead of the next big figure and last Thursday’s 110.96 high, while Eur/Jpy has rebounded over 124.00 having tested and probed below key Fib support around 123.80 on a couple of occasions. Meanwhile, the Franc has been more rangebound between 0.9905-73, but as noted above stronger against the Euro even though the SNB has stressed that NIRP and intervention remains appropriate, if not paramount given the Chf’s high value and the fragility of FX markets.</p><p><strong>* NOK/SEK/TRY: </strong>The Scandi Crowns have been very volatile within 9.7465-9.6215 and 10.5010-10.3890 ranges vs the Eur amidst fluctuations in crude prices, mixed regional data/surveys and phases of risk aversion/appetite. However, the Nok and Sek retain an underlying bid on comparatively upbeat/hawkish Norges Bank and Riskbank outlooks and policy guidance vs the ECB (and other global Central Banks for that matter). Conversely, the Lira has been largely weaker between 5.7716-5.2680 boundaries vs the Usd as jitters ahead of the weekend regional Turkish elections compounded investor angst over renewed strains on the diplomatic front with the US and a liquidity squeeze induced by the CBRT via the suspension of daily repos.</p><p><strong>* COMING-UP: Monday: </strong>ISM Mfg, Mfg PMIs, EZ CPI, US Retail Sales, Construction Spending.<strong> Tuesday: </strong>RBA, EZ Unemployment, US Durable Goods. <strong>Wednesday: </strong>Services PMI; ISM non-Mfg; China Vice Premier Liu travels to US for trade talks; Aus Trade Balance; US ADP. <strong>Thursday: </strong>RBI, US Challenger Job Cuts, US and Canadian Labour Market Reports. <strong>Friday: </strong>No major releases. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21497/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p><p><strong>* Central Bank Weekly: </strong>Previewing RBA, RBI; Reviewing ECB, RBNZ, SARB, Banxico, BCB, NBH. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21498/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p>",

There was also demand inspired by Brexit uncertainty, as well US President Trump firing barbs at Mexico on Twitter, and then subsequently in remarks. The curve remained flatter into the close, and traders will be focussed on Monday’s liquidity impact from SOMA day.&nbsp;</p>",

Citi's energy analysts said \"the market is also gaining supportive press coverage, as newswire coverage touts what will be the largest quarterly rise since 2009, with OPEC+ production cuts and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela cited as the bullish fundamental lever.\" Other tailwinds included: Russian Energy Minister Novak denying reports from earlier in the week that Russia would only agree to a three-month extension of supply curbs, which had previously spooked the market; Barclay's forecasting prices to move higher in Q2, with Brent averaging at USD 73/bbl and WTI USD 65/bbl. On the other hand, following Venezuela’s blackout this week, there were signs production was coming back online with news that the Jose oil export terminal had resumed operations. US Baker Hughes Rig Count showed rigs cutting for the sixth consecutive week and the data shows drillers have cut the most rigs in a quarter since 2016, with oil rigs -8 at 816, natgas rigs -2 at 190, total rigs -10 at 1006 for the recent week.</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: data, Central Banks and US-China trade provide some Brexit distractions",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has been subjected to another wild Brexit related ride within relatively wide ranges of 1.3270-1.2976 in Cable and 0.8650-0.8482 for Eur/Gbp, and looks set to end the week under more intense pressure following the latest Parliament rejection of the WA (which was tabled again without the PD to satisfy the criteria preventing the same motion being presented multiple times). This follows IVs on 8 alternative strategies on Wednesday that failed to a produce a majority backing for any of the amendments, and means the UK is heading for an EU exit on April 12 without any deal or different plan to put before Brussels and argue the case for a further A 50 extension to May 22. Predictably, pressure on PM May to stand down has ramped up amidst GE speculation, but at this point it seems more IVs will take place next week and MV4 is also a possibility. For more please check out our headline feed.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and index are on course to end or at least break a losing streak with net gains on the week, partly due to currency losses elsewhere, a rebound in US Treasury yields amidst a degree of normalisation along the curve from ultra-low and fairly deeply inverted levels. However, the DXY has topped out (for now) at 97.345 vs 96.654 at the start of the week and a 96.404 low after a weak Chicago PMI continued the run of mostly softer than forecast US macro releases.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The single currency has lost ground vs the Usd and Chf, in sympathy with the Pound to an extent, and after kicking off the week on the front foot as the latest German Ifo survey beat on all counts, including upward revisions to the previous month. Eur/Usd is currently just above lows only a few pips away from 1.1200 vs 1.1330 or so at one stage, while Eur/Chf is close to the base of 1.1255-1.1163 parameters following more benign Eurozone inflation data, dovish ECB rhetoric on balance and talk of tiered deposits ahead of TLTRO3.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>All ending Friday’s EU session firmer vs their US rival, with the Loonie finding support via encouraging Canadian GDP data that countered a wider trade deficit yesterday, and firmer oil prices. In fact, Usd/Cad is just off a fresh low for the week around 1.3340 after filing bids at 1.3350 vs 1.3450 at the other extreme, and with some additional impetus from China via the lifting of some Canola import restrictions. The Kiwi and Aussie both drew encouragement from reports that more progress was made between the US and China at the latest round of trade negotiations and for the former also improved ANZ consumer sentiment, but Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd are still rooted closer to the bases of 0.6924-0.6772 and 0.7145-0.7062 respective bands following an unexpectedly dovish twist from the RBNZ (that now sees more chance of the OCR being lowered vs 50-50 between an ease or hike previously), and risks of the RBA following suit next week. Note, however, JPM is now looking for the RBNZ to cut rates twice in May and June, and the Aud/Nzd cross has rebounded from sub-1.0300 to 1.0400+ in response.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The Jpy has been largely hostage to general swings in risk sentiment, UST yields and related Greenback moves as the BoJ stays in full-on easing mode and domestic data remains soft. However, some big option expiries, tech levels and orders for Japanese FY end amidst month and Q1 positioning has also impacted the headline pair plus Jpy crosses. Usd/Jpy has climbed from lows of 109.70 towards 111.00, but is still capped ahead of the next big figure and last Thursday’s 110.96 high, while Eur/Jpy has rebounded over 124.00 having tested and probed below key Fib support around 123.80 on a couple of occasions. Meanwhile, the Franc has been more rangebound between 0.9905-73, but as noted above stronger against the Euro even though the SNB has stressed that NIRP and intervention remains appropriate, if not paramount given the Chf’s high value and the fragility of FX markets.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/TRY</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns have been very volatile within 9.7465-9.6215 and 10.5010-10.3890 ranges vs the Eur amidst fluctuations in crude prices, mixed regional data/surveys and phases of risk aversion/appetite. However, the Nok and Sek retain an underlying bid on comparatively upbeat/hawkish Norges Bank and Riskbank outlooks and policy guidance vs the ECB (and other global Central Banks for that matter). Conversely, the Lira has been largely weaker between 5.7716-5.2680 boundaries vs the Usd as jitters ahead of the weekend regional Turkish elections compounded investor angst over renewed strains on the diplomatic front with the US and a liquidity squeeze induced by the CBRT via the suspension of daily repos.</p>",

In light of the rejection, the EU exit date becomes April 12th, as opposed to the 23rd May should it have been accepted.</p><p><strong>*EU REACTION</strong>: European Council President Tusks calls an EU summit on April 10th in light of UK Parliament rejected Withdrawal Agreement, with the UK requiring a decision by the 8th of April. The UK then must notify the EU of their decision by the 11th April. The European Commission also admitted that a no-deal Brexit is now the most likely scenario on April 12th.</p><p><strong>*PM MAY: </strong>The rejection also opens up the possibility for a general election to be called, as suggested by sources cited by HuffPost's Paul Waugh.</p><p><strong>*WHAT’S NEXT</strong>: Looking ahead, the next step is when the second round of indicative votes will take place, with some suggesting that this could come as soon as Monday 1st April. Henceforth the path will depend on the PM’s acceptance of the results of the indication, should they command any majority at all. It is also worth noting that the indicative vote will need to passage of the Withdrawal Agreement, hence Meaningful Vote 4 cannot be ruled out</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/b1ab0e24-19ee-4e0b-8d00-dc1f6edb311c.jpg\"></figure>",

To get around House Speaker Bercow’s requirements of a “changed” deal to be put for a third vote, PM May decided to split the deal and only vote on the first part, i.e. the WA.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*TODAY’S SCHEDULE [GMT]</strong></p><ul><li>14:30 – Vote on the Withdrawal Agreement</li></ul><p><strong>*AMENDMENTS: House Speaker Bercow has selected no amendments for debate in Parliament today</strong></p><p><strong>*WHAT PM MAY NEEDS</strong></p><p><strong>NUMBERS:</strong> For PM May to get majority for her deal, she needs to:</p><ul><li>Retain all 242 existing votes</li><li>Win over all 75 opponents in her own party, including 69 Brexiteers (5 already indicated they will oppose it, one Tory MP abstained from MV2, a vote which could give PM a majority of 2)</li><li>For every Tory MP who opposes the deal, PM May needs one MP from another party or two opponents willing to abstain</li></ul><p>Total excludes the 4 tellers, 3 deputy speakers, 7 Sinn Fein MPs</p><p><strong>*WHAT IS EXPECTED:</strong></p><ul><li>PM May is expected to again be defeated in Parliament as she is unlikely to conjure up support from Labour and DUP (who have confirmed they will vote against the WA). There is still no confirmed direction from the ERG, although the group has said that they are likely to follow the DUP’s lead.</li><li>Cabinet sources have also noted that the WA is unlikely to pass as there is not enough time to get the votes.</li><li>MPs claim that just 12 hardcore Tory ERG MPs are left opposing PM May's deal; according to Sun's Deputy Political Editor Steve Hawkes</li><li>A UK Minister reportedly believes that PM May's WA will be voted down by 20 votes; according to Mail on Sunday's Deputy Political Editor Cole</li><li><strong>Former Brexit Minister Raab confirms he will vote in favour of PM May's deal</strong></li><li>SNP's Gray says some Labour MP's are preparing to back PM May's agreement</li><li>Many more Labour MPs will vote for PM May's Withdrawal Agreement; according to ITV's Preston citing a senior Tory's Whip</li><li>Buzzfeed's Alex Wickham notes that 45 Tory MPs still oppose PM May's deal</li><li>UK DUP spokesperson noted that there are ways to pile pressure on PM May's government if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed</li></ul><p><strong>*EU EXPECTATIONS: There is little expectation in the EU today that the Withdrawal Agreement will pass </strong>and as such, the EU mood is one of resignation now, according to BBC's Adler</p><p><strong>*WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:</strong></p><p><strong>BREXIT DATE</strong>: In the event the <strong>deal passes, Brexit date will be moved to 22nd May</strong> as agreed with the European Commission in Strasbourg.<strong> If not, the date remains as April 12th</strong>. (See below for possible scenarios). BBC's Katya Adler noted that if UK chooses no deal, EU very unlikely to insist 12 April date to leave. It will likely choose 22 May as cut off date. This still separates Brexit from European Parliamentary elections (they start 23 May) but leaves extra time to better finalise no deal preparations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GENERAL ELECTION: </strong>UK government ministers privately suggested a general election will be called if Friday's vote is rejected or things \"fall apart\", according HuffPost's Paul Waugh</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/df6e796a-918c-4778-b4fc-398a5c67b9a2.jpg\"></figure>",

However, the DXY has nudged above the 97.300 level that capped its advances yesterday and in doing so crossed a key Fib at 97.245 (76.4% retrace of the fall from 97.711 to 95.735), which bodes well from a chart standpoint ahead of potentially pivotal data including Chicago PMI and a trio of Fed speakers (Williams, Kaplan and Quarles).</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>Bucking the broad trend on the aforementioned constructive US-China vibes, but with the Kiwi also getting a much needed fillip from ANZ’s consumer sentiment survey overnight showing an improvement in March. Nzd/Usd rebounded to just over 0.6800 at one stage, but then pared gains on more dovish RBNZ impulses, albeit indirectly as JPM updated its 2019 outlook for NZ rates with back-to-back cuts now seen in May and June. Similar story for the Aussie that briefly reclaimed 0.7100 before fading, while the Loonie is still relatively rangebound between 1.3420-45 ahead of Canadian PPI data.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All softer vs the Usd, with the Jpy extending its retreat from a fraction shy of 110.00 to circa 110.92 amidst reports of Japanese selling for FY end on top of the general improvement in risk sentiment. However, supply is said to be sitting at 111.00 and the recent 110.96 peak is still providing technical resistance. The single currency is holding just above 1.1200 with buying interest touted from 1.1210 down to the figure and decent option expiry interest also supporting as 1.5 bn rolls off at the NY cut vs 1.2 bn from 1.1250-60. The Franc is essentially flat vs the Buck and Euro around 0.9950 and within 1.1190-65 parameters respectively following SNB comments on Thursday reinforcing the commitment to maintain NIRP and intervention given the Chf’s ongoing high valuation and fragility in the currency markets. Last, but by no means least heading into yet another crucial Brexit vote in the HoC, the Pound is depressed with Cable almost losing the 1.3000 handle despite a big buy order at 1.3010 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.8600 where a sizeable 1 bn expiries reside and run-off only 30 minutes or so before the Parliament decide whether to back the WA.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In contrast to partial recoveries elsewhere, the Lira has lurched to new lows vs the Dollar not far from 5.6600 as the run continues almost relentlessly, and with little last respite from a narrower than forecast Turkish trade deficit.</p>",

Bunds remain off worst levels (166.13) as March and Q1 draws to a close, with the next fundamental input coming via German unemployment before more Eurozone inflation data, this time from Italy. Comments from ECB’s Coeure will also be monitored for anything on TLTRO3 and/or the potential for a tiered deposit system to be adopted that was poo pooed by Knot on Thursday.</p>",

Fed's Williams -- like the Fed's Daly earlier in the week -- suggested that the yield curve inversion might not necessarily portend a recession; previously some FOMC members have argued that the size of the Fed's balance sheet makes presents challenges for this signal as portending a recession. US T-note futures (M9) settled 6 ticks lower at 124-16.</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (voter, dove)</strong> said normalization process in US is at an end and suggested they have gone as far as they can. Bullard also commented that it is premature to consider a rate cut now and that he sees a likely rebound in economic growth during Q2 and the rest of 2019. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Williams (voter, hawk)</strong> said the US economy is in a very good place and there is a reality it is slowing but to a sustainable pace. Williams also commented that he is not as worried about the chances of a recession as some in the private sector and that yield curve inversion has historically pointed to a recession but that may not be the case today, while he also doesn't believe governments can run large deficits indefinitely without consequences.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were higher across the board as the region took impetus from the US, where all major indices finished positive and trade-sensitive sectors outperformed on optimism as US-China high-level talks resumed in Beijing. ASX 200 (+0.1%) eked mild gain as most sectors remained afloat heading into quarter-end although gold miners were heavily weighed after the precious metal succumbed to the pressure from a firmer greenback. Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) was driven by currency weakness with Daiichi Sankyo surging nearly 16% to hit limit up and a record high after it signed a USD 6.9bln collaboration and commercialization deal for its cancer drug with AstraZeneca in which it will receive an upfront payment of USD 1.35bln. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) conformed to the upbeat tone and the Shanghai Comp. (+2.6%) outperformed as trade discussions continued in Beijing and after China announced electricity and fuel costs reductions ahead of incoming VAT cuts. Huawei also supported the risk appetite after it posted a 25% increase in annual profits despite the ongoing US tiff, although not all stocks benefitted as some contended with disappointing earnings including China’s largest lender ICBC which fell short of FY net forecasts after flat Q4 profits. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as the fixed income complex eased from the rampant inflows seen this week and as gains in stocks dampened demand for safe-haven assets, although downside was limited with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 710bln of JGBs in the belly to super long-end.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board as the region takes impetus from the US, where all major indices finished positive and trade-sensitive sectors outperformed on optimism as US-China talks resumed. ASX 200 (+0.3%) has eked mild gain as most sectors remain afloat heading into quarter-end aside from gold miners after the precious metal succumbed to the pressure from a firmer greenback, while Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) stocks are driven by currency weakness, as well as news flow with Daiichi Sankyo surging nearly 16% to hit limit up and a record high after it signed a USD 6.9bln collaboration and commercialization deal for its cancer drug with AstraZeneca in which it will receive an upfront payment of USD 1.35bln. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.4%) outperform as high-level trade talks continue in Beijing and with China also announcing electricity and fuel costs reductions due to VAT cuts. However, not all stocks have benefitted as some contend with earnings including China’s largest lender ICBC which fell short of FY net forecasts after flat Q4 profits.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds steady above the 97.00 level following the prior day’s advances as its main counterparts remain subdued including EUR/USD which languishes near 2-week lows as some suggest ECB’s consideration of tiered-deposit rates as an intention to keep rates lower for longer. Meanwhile, GBP/USD attempts some composure following the Brexit-related bedlam and ahead of today’s watered-down Brexit vote in which MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement only, and not the political declaration on the future relationship with the EU, to secure a Brexit date extension. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses benefit from safe-haven outflows, while antipodeans are somewhat choppy with support from the heightened risk appetite counterbalanced by the dovish views for the relevant central banks with JP Morgan now forecasting the RBNZ to lower rates in May and June this year, and as some also suggest potential ramifications this could have for the RBA ahead of next week’s policy meeting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as the fixed income complex begins to ease from the rampant inflows this week and as gains in stocks dampen demand for safe-haven assets, although downside is limited with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 710bln of JGBs in the belly to super long-end.</p>",
