US places travel advisory on Hong Kong; German growth contracts in Q2; soft China activity data; Fed’s Bullard offers no easing signs.</li><li><strong>COMING UP:</strong> Australian Employment Report, Norges Bank, UK Retail Sales, US Philly Fed, NY Empire State Manufacturing, Retail Sales, Industrial Production.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Overnight, the PBOC fixed the yuan stronger against the USD, perhaps cushioning some of the negativity from the monthly activity data. Even amid the risk off in European and US trading hours, the yuan remains firm. The bid in havens had deflated slightly in overnight trade, partly helped by Tuesday's news that the US has delayed many of the tariffs that were due to kick-in next month. However, as the justification for the delay becomes more obvious (to help US consumers, rather than to appease the Chinese), the bounce in equities seen in wake of Tuesday's announcement has been pared back, and stocks seeing another deep day of losses. Equities, meanwhile, continued to grind lower, but the ES found stability after European traders had left just above the 2840 region; the crude complex has tracked equity performance, with demand side concerns dominating, although news from the supply side hardly helped (DOE reported a crude inventory build this week, in line with the API data). Havens JPY, CHF and XAU were once again were in demand. The 2s10s part of the Treasury curve inverted on Wednesday, which stoked risk-off sentiment, as participants once again fear the recession signal it sends. The USD is higher, despite lower yields. The EUR has managed to shake off much of the Italian tensions this week, with 1.12 anchoring the currency; however, German GDP contraction in Q2 has helped shift the range slightly lower (we didn't manage to hit the 1.12 in Wednesday trade). Risk-off flows also saw EMFX hit. Cable, meanwhile, trades flat after firmer CPI today.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 22 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-16+: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-flattened amid risk-off trade. Much attention was on curve spreads, where the US 2s10s part of the curve inverted in Wednesday pre-market trade, which investors have traditionally associated with an increase in recession risks. BofAML analysts note that 2s10s yield curve inversions have preceded the last seven recessions and nine out of the last 12 recessions. BofAML says that the SPX can take time to peak after a yield curve inversion, noting that sometimes the S&amp;P 500 peaks within two-to-three months of a 2s10s inversion, but it can take one to two years for an S&amp;P 500 peak after an inversion. For the ten inversions back to 1956, the S&amp;P 500 topped out within approximately three months of the inversion six times (1956, 1959, 1965, 1973, 1980, and 2000), BofAML says, the S&amp;P 500 took 11 to 22 months to peak after the other four inversions (1967, 1978, 1989, and 2005). BofAML says the equity market is on borrowed time after the yield curve inverts. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/treasury-2s10s-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-2007-bofaml-says-equity-market-is-now-on-borrowed-time-14-08-2019\">Continue reading the full RANsquawk analysis here</a>.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA/HONG KONG: </strong>China confirmed it would hold talks with the US in September, after the latter's decision to delay some tariff hikes. Regarding Hong Kong, there were some reports suggesting protestors were clashing with police again, however, the markets attention was not as attentive as it was on Tuesday. However, US House Speaker Pelosi said that if America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, it will lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere, adding that in the coming weeks, she will work to pass the bicameral and bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm the US commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing’s crackdown. The comments are unlikely to be received well in Beijing, which has asked foreign nations to stay out of its domestic affairs; while the Trump Administration seems content to do that, Democrat Pelosi does not, and it has not gone unnoticed in Beijing; Chinese press reported late Tuesday that US politicians&nbsp; were the \"black hand behind these mobsters for recent escalated violence.\" Later in the day, the US State Department issued a travel advisory for Hong Kong, saying increased caution in the area due to civil unrest. A State Department spokesperson later said that the unrest in Hong Kong erodes HK’s autonomy, and puts at risk its long-established special status in international affairs</p><p><strong>* US COMMERCE SECRETARY ROSS: </strong>Ross gave a wide-ranging interview; starting with the Treasury curve, he downplayed the importance of the US 2s10s curve inversion. However, his comments on tariffs got more attention; Ross seemed to toe the line, suggesting the delay was decided on to minimise the chances of a disruptive holiday shopping season, and confirmed there was no quid-pro-quo from China. Ross says the US objectives remain the same: (1) Increase current trade; 2) tackling structural reforms, and technology transfers – this takes legislation, Ross says, and; 3) a verifiable and enforceable deal. He also did not believe that a date has been set for September talks with China. Ross said the Commerce Department will update on Huawei on Monday 19th August, and he also toed the Administration line on Hong Kong, stating that he hopes the situation works out between all parties. He said the President has made clear he is watching carefully the build-up of troops in Shenzhen, but the question was what the US can do, adding that 'this is an internal matter'. On the Chinese economy, Ross said it has been slowing, cites manufacturing data. Says there is no question that a lot of the supply chains are moving elsewhere.</p><p><strong>* US TRADE ADVISOR NAVARRO: </strong>The White House Advisor delivered another insipid interview on business television, where he said a lot without really saying anything new. He said Trump's tariff delay decisions were 'strong and flexible', and reiterated that the reason for the delay was to keep consumer prices low over the holiday period. Navarro said that talks with China continue, and a call will be held in the next fortnight (as China confirmed overnight). HE reiterated that several issues remain in talks, and called for patience, but added the US cannot meet China 'halfway'. Navarro reiterated the Trumpian criticism of the Fed, stating that it was the biggest problem facing the US economy. He also said that the 2s10s inversion was another reason why the Fed should cut rates.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Bullard (voter, dove) said economic outcomes are good for the US, and it was a good time for the Fed to conduct a policy review, adding that the review could study negative rates as a tool. Bullard says the biggest issue has been this zero-lower bound, \"we started calling it effective lower bound because some countries have negative interest rates now. But the zero lower bound means that you kind of get stuck in monetary policy,\" and he adds \"you can’t move the policy rate anymore. And then you have to resort to other types of policies as I was just noting.\" Equities, which have been under pressure today, saw negative ticks on Bullard's remarks, with traders noting that the dovish voter again offered no explicit signal suggesting the FOMC is in a rush to loosen policy; in recent remarks, Bullard had indicated that he was in data watching mode in his policy deliberations. Later in the day, the Washington Post reported that White House officials have not had discussions of any stimulus, as taxes have already been cut and spending has been boosted, but they note that the primary tactic is to pressure Fed Chair Powell.</p><p><strong>* US IMPORT PRICES:</strong> Import prices rose by 0.2% M/M (exp. -0.1%) and -1.8% Y/Y. The data suggests that import prices had a modest downward impact on July core PCE estimates, Goldman Sachs says, and the bank lowered its month-over-month and year-over-year forecasts by 0.01pp and 0.02pp to +0.16% and +1.59%, respectively.</p><p><strong>* CHINA DATA: </strong>July activity data has come in below expectations (industrial production missed expected at 4.8% Y/Y from 6.3%; retail sales short of consensus at 7.6% Y/Y from 9.8%; fixed asset investment 5.7% Y/Y against expected unchanged 5.8%; nationwide unemployment ticks up by 0.2ppts to 5.3%). The weakening of activity growth in July was the direct result of weaker domestic policy supports since the end of June, Goldman Sachs says. Export growth does not appear to have been a drag on broad activity growth in July. Goldman observes that policymakers marginally tightened policies on the back of the following positive factors: activity growth was strong in June; the liquidity stress related to Baosheng Bank’s takeover was gradually fading; trade negotiations appeared to be going smoothly at the time. GS thinks that policymakers’ behaviour may also reflect the uncertainties related to the underlying momentum of the economy without active policy supports. \"Between March 2017 and March 2018, activity growth held up despite a fairly aggressive broad-based policy tightening, so policy makers may have been hoping for something similar to happen this time. But given the experience over the past year it should be clear by now that the situation is very different, not least because of the external economic environment.\" GS says that under the current environment, activity growth is only likely to be strong when there is clear policy support, such as in 1Q and June, and as soon as policy supports became less forceful, activity growth could weaken.\" GS also says that activity data suggests sequential growth is tracking below the 6-6.5% range. \"We believe the policy stance is likely being loosened again in August to support economic growth. We expect August and September growth to be stronger as a result.\" The bank argues that policymakers cannot afford to wait for another month of data, especially in light of the upcoming 70th Anniversary of the founding of the PRC on October 1st. \"The latest announcement on tariff adjustment from the US may lead to continued front loading of exports which is likely to be supportive of short-term growth,\" GS writes, adding that \"policy support is likely be somewhat less aggressive than it would otherwise be.\"</p><p><strong>* GERMAN GDP: </strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the release was \"not pretty\", but \"slightly better than we had feared based on the monthly data\". Although the breakdown of the report is yet to be published, it highlights \"comments from the statistical office suggest that domestic demand remained relatively resilient amid further weakness in net trade\". Looking further ahead, the Consultancy notes that early indicators for Q3 suggests that the economy remains soft, therefore the risk of a recession is now elevated. However, \"indicators for domestic private demand remain relatively resilient\".</p><p><strong>* UK CPI: </strong>Inflation accelerated by more than expected in July, printing 2.1% Y/Y (vs expected 1.9%, and a previous 2.0%; BOE's latest QIR had forecast 1.8% Y/Y); the core measure rose to 1.9% (expected 1.8%, previous 1.8%). With inflation above 2% again, analysts said that the data might dampen speculation that the Bank of England may soon follow in the Fed’s footsteps and cut interest rates. \"Indeed,\" Capital Economics says, \"with the ongoing strength in pay growth and the fall in the pound likely to leave inflation above the 2% target in 2020, we still think that it is only in a no deal Brexit that the MPC will cut rates.\" The core measure rose on the back of slight rises in one or two of the core sectors, including hotel rooms and computer games, as well as smaller summer clothing discounts this year compared to in 2018. Capital Economics admits that utility price falls will probably push inflation back down below the 2% target again before the end of the year, while fuel prices probably have further to fall too, as retailers pass on the latest drop in oil prices. \"Beyond that, though, the strength in pay growth and the fall in the pound will probably mean that inflation spends most of its time above the 2% target in 2020,\" the consultancy writes, \"was some tentative evidence that cost pressures are picking up again, with factory gate price inflation rising from 1.6% to 2.0%, which should also feed into the core rate of inflation in time.\" CapEco says that, in short, \"the figures will do little to affect the BOE's view that interest rates will most likely be raised if there is a Brexit deal and global growth recovers,\" and \"it is only in a no deal scenario that we think the MPC would cut rates, perhaps from 0.75% to at least 0.25%.\"</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Speaker John Bercow said he would block Boris Johnson from proroguing parliament in order to force through a no deal Brexit, the Telegraph reported. UK PM Johnson said the EU is not compromising at all in Brexit negotiations, adding that the longer it goes on, the larger chance of no deal Brexit. Johnson urged compromise, but added that the more EU thinks Parliament can block no deal, the less likely they are to compromise. He reiterated that the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. On elections, Johnson says UK public have had a lot of elections, want govt to get on with Brexit. Meanwhile, US House Speaker Pelosi reiterated her stance that there is no chance that a US-UK trade agreement will pass through congress in the event that the Brexit deal breaks the Good Friday Accord.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLED USD 1.87 LOWER AT USD 55.23/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLED USD 1.82 LOWER AT USD 59.48: </strong>The crude complex trundled lower on Wednesday, with participants paring back Tuesday’s optimism following revived global demand concerns, as well as bearish US inventories. The tariff “reprieve” hasn’t held the market narrative for long. Germany’s GDP falling into contraction (-0.1%, as expected), Chinese industrial production at the lowest rate since February 2002 (4.8% vs. exp. 6.0%) in addition to a miss on Chinese retail sales (7.6% vs. exp. 8.6%), and the US nominal yield curve (2s10s) inverting are all seeing risk appetite diminish. Although less in vogue, the EIA reported its latest US energy inventories where crude stocks +1.5mln bbls (exp. -2.8mln, API reported +3.7mln), the products both printed surprise draws, Cushing stocks -2.5mln, whilst production remained unchanged at 12.3mln BPD; price reaction was muted at the time of the EIA release.</p><p>* <strong>STOCK CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -2.9% at 2840, NASDAQ-100 -3.1% at 7490, Dow Jones -3.1% at 25479.</p><p>*<strong>SECTOR CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary -3.1%, Consumer Staples -1.6%, Energy -4.1%, Financials -3.6%, Health Care -2.9%, Industrials -3%, Information Technology -3.1%, Materials -3.3%, Telecommunication Services -3.1% &amp; Utilities -1%.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS/SUB-SECTORS: </strong>A complete 180-degree turn from Tuesday’s trade, where all sectors are red. Energy underperformed amid as crude slid amid the risk off. Financials were lower as the 2s10s inverted for the first time since 2007. The move in gold benefitted miners, with the Gold sub-index outperforming. Department stores were the underperformers following Macy’s (M) results which dragged down the retail sector.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Newmont Goldcorp (NEM) and Barrick Gold (GOLD) were driven by higher gold prices as risk sentiment soured and the precious metal remained comfortably above the USD 1500/oz handle. Macy’s (M) weighed on retail stocks after its earnings missed expectations, and it narrowed its EPS guidance; L Brands (LB), Kohls (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) were all under pressure. Also of note, Walmart (WMT) reports pre-market on Thursday; analysts expect EPS to come in at USD 1.22 on revenues of USD 130.2bln. Another underperformer in Wednesday trade was Mylan (MYL) after Mylan (MYL) and Teva (TEVA) are being probed for apparent coordinated obstruction of a drug price investigation.</p><p><strong>* NORGES PREVIEW:</strong> Norges Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 1.25% on Thursday, according to all 31 analysts surveyed by Reuters. Hence, focus for this meeting will be on whether the Bank maintains the outlook which sees another 25bp hike in 2019 and if this is still expected to occur at September’s meeting. Note, 15/29 analysts surveyed by Reuters look for a Q3 25bps hike to 1.50% vs. 14/29 looking for rates to remain at 1.25%. Domestic data has been slightly softer since the prior meeting, though not significantly away from the Norges Bank’s forecasts for CPI. Dovish moves by other global Central Banks are likely to be the most significant factor for policy makers at this meeting in terms of signalling, with scope for this to be sufficient enough to dampen Norway’s hawkish outlook. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22538/download\">Read full RANsquawk preview here</a>.</p>",

Much attention was on curve spreads, where the US 2s10s part of the curve inverted in Wednesday pre-market trade, which investors have traditionally associated with an increase in recession risks. BofAML analysts note that 2s10s yield curve inversions have preceded the last seven recessions and nine out of the last 12 recessions. BofAML says that the SPX can take time to peak after a yield curve inversion, noting that sometimes the S&amp;P 500 peaks within two-to-three months of a 2s10s inversion, but it can take one to two years for an S&amp;P 500 peak after an inversion. For the ten inversions back to 1956, the S&amp;P 500 topped out within approximately three months of the inversion six times (1956, 1959, 1965, 1973, 1980, and 2000), BofAML says, the S&amp;P 500 took 11 to 22 months to peak after the other four inversions (1967, 1978, 1989, and 2005). BofAML says the equity market is on borrowed time after the yield curve inverts. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/treasury-2s10s-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-2007-bofaml-says-equity-market-is-now-on-borrowed-time-14-08-2019\">Continue reading the full RANsquawk analysis here</a>.</p>",

The Franc has also extended its recovery towards 0.9700 vs the Greenback, and against an increasingly weak Euro to 1.0840 as Eur/Usd breached Fib support at Monday’s low and is now testing the next downside chart level ahead of 1.1100 around 1.1138. Hence, the <strong>DXY </strong>is nudging 98.000 compared to 97.661 at one stage, and with additional support/momentum coming from bigger gains relative to risk or high beta currencies compared to losses vs safer havens, like Gold that is keeping tabs on Usd1500/oz.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>All knocked back by the aforementioned disappointing macro releases, and ongoing yield curve flattening to transitory inversion in some 2-10 year spreads that has merely heightened recessionary concerns. Aud/Usd has retreated through previously firm support at 0.6750, Usd/Cad is back above 1.3300 with recoiling oil prices also undermining the Loonie, and Nzd/Usd is under 0.6450 again. Ahead, comments from RBA’s Debelle and Aussie jobs data will likely provide independent impetus, but risk aversion is gathering pace at present, and also undermining the Scandi Crowns regardless of frothy Swedish inflation prints that could keep the Riksbank on track to maintain a tightening bias. On that note, Thursday will reveal whether the Norges Bank sticks to its guns for a hike as soon as September, and for a full preview see out headline feed or research suite. Eur/Sek now circa 10.7230 and Eur/Nok hovering just shy of 10.0000.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has remained perky since UK CPI data came in firmer than forecast, but not as a direct result, and Cable is still not able to surpass 1.2100 amidst ongoing no deal Brexit and UK political risk, while 10 DMA chart resistance also sits just above the big figure at 1.2112.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A sea of red across the region, and with the Ars handing back recovery gains even though current President Macri has unveiled a plan to stem the economic crisis and the Central Bank continues to intervene.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*OVERVIEW:</strong> Last Thursday, a senior government official stated that Germany considering issuance of new debt to finance climate plans, implying a revisit to its current balanced federal budget and the “black zero” principle, (i.e. the principle that avoids creating new debt for more climate protection measure), essentially a “debt brake”. In light of the news, Bund futures fell as traders priced in the ramp up in supply and the beneficial effects for growth and inflation against the backdrop of bleak economic outlook. Germany noted that there is no firm decision to give up the balanced budget.</p><p><strong>*IMPLICATIONS</strong>: Arguments have been building on whether Germany should ditch its self-imposed fiscal constraints:</p><p>1) Fresh debt issuance would be one of the easiest ways to create additional fiscal space, given that the Merkel government has little room to manoeuvre. The move also requires no legal changes and would pump around EUR 10bln (0.3% of GDP) into the government’s 2020 fiscal leeway.</p><p>2) Crucially, the abandoning of the balanced budget would allow for&nbsp; a quicker and swifter fiscal response in the case of a severe downturn, with the latest German GDP figures showing a Q2 QQ contraction (-0.1% vs. Prev. 0.4%). Add to that, the US/China-led global economic slowdown, the rising risks of a no-deal Brexit and the US/EU trade spat.</p><p><strong>*THE FLIP SIDE</strong>: Scrapping the “black zero” principle could potentially come with political costs. Merkel’s CDU party would be dropping a massive selling point to voters and its party base who see a balanced budget as a sensible economic policy when faced with fiscal challenges from an aging population, OxEco analysts say. However, voices within the SPD (the CDU/CSU coalition partner) are challenging how prudent a balanced budget is, with some core voters less questioning its necessity. Moreover, the new fiscal measures would require a 2/3 majority in the Budestag and the Bundesrat which seems a stretch as only the Green Party is showing growing willingness to ditch the current policy framework.</p><p><strong>*LIKELIHOOD</strong>: Desks note that in the short-term, Germany is unlikely to roll out this form of fiscal support until it sees clear signs of a severe downturn and an imminent recession. Looking further ahead, analysts note that the government may need to rely on these new measures to find resources to sufficiently invest to prepare the German economy for the future. Oxford Eco are cautious in regard to the desertion of fiscal constraints given the aforementioned political backdrop, unless a deep economic recession evolves. More recently, the German Economy Minister stated that the Q2 GDP metrics were a wake-up call and a warning sign, although noted that a recession can be avoided if measures are taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

However, the Dollar is treading water just off a 97.661 base in DXY terms in wake of firmer than forecast US import and export price data that is unlikely to leave a lasting impression given a relatively limited/muted reaction to headline inflation yesterday. Instead, Wall Street’s response to considerably less enthusiasm over Tuesday’s tariff concessions and US-China phone conversation could be telling along with knock-on/contagion from the more pronounced yield declines and curve flattening/inversion.</p>",

Major bourses are posting broad-based losses although Italy’s FTSE MIB (-1.9%) is underperforming, as the ongoing political angst sees almost all Italian stocks in the red. Meanwhile, DAX 30 (-1.4%) breached the key 11,600 support level on which the index turned-around during the May rout. Sectors are all in negative territory, although defensive sectors are somewhat more resilient, i.e. utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. In terms of individual movers, Commerzbank (-4.0%) fell to a new record low of EUR 5/shr as the German banking rout deepens following a Germany GDP Q/Q contraction and as the bank tracks German yields.

Subsequent comments from President Trump indicate that the concessions are not in response to any progress in negotiations or reciprocity from Beijing, but an effort to avoid US consumers feeling the pinch over the festive period. Meanwhile, latest Chinese data has also dampened spirits with ip and retail sales both falling short of expectations, though the PBoC has stalled the measured Yuan depreciation and Usd/Cny ended on-shore trade below the official fix. Usd/Jpy back down around 106.00 and Usd/Chf is pivoting 0.9730 as Xau/Usd returns to justy above 1500/oz mark amidst faltering risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/SEK/NOK -</strong> The single currency and Sterling are both firmer vs the Dollar even though the DXY is holding the bulk of its post-US CPI gains within a 97.847-660 range, and data has helped to an extent given Eurozone Q2 GDP matching or slightly surpassing forecasts, while headline UK inflation was firmer than consensus along with the core. However, Eur/Usd and Cable remain top-heavy ahead of 1.1200 and 1.2100, with the former still unable to breach Fib resistance at 1.1220 convincingly or on a closing basis, and also faced with decent option expiry interest today at 1.1215 (1.3 bn). Similarly, the Swedish Krona only got a fleeting boost from CPIF beats vs market medians and the Riksbank’s own projection, as inflated food prices were partly if not largely to blame, while another retreat in crude prices is weighing on its Norwegian peer, as Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok hover closer to the tops of 10.7145-6455 and 9.9715-9085 bands respectively.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD -</strong> The aforementioned tempered exuberance surrounding US-China relations and disappointing data have taken their toll of the Aussie in particular, with Aud/Usd recoiling from 0.6800+ recovery peaks towards 0.6750 again, Nzd/Usd back under 0.6450 and Usd/Cad rebounding from sub-1.3200 to just shy of 1.3250.

For the record, Bunds have been up to 178.14, Gilts as high as 134.63, but still some way shy of the 135.01 contract high and 10 year Treasuries 130-085 at best. Ahead, more price data via US import and export readings, but it’s all about sentiment and whether Wall Street picks up where it left off yesterday or takes fright given latest bond market moves and the heightened risk of recession implied by the rate depression and spread compression.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>WTI and Brent prices have held onto the bulk of their trade-driven gains in which the benchmarks soared around USD 3/bbl after the USTR decided to delay tariffs on some Chinese goods until December 15th. Sentiment drove yesterday’s gains, although ultimately, the demand outlook remains unchanged unless material progress can be made in dialogue, i.e. if the nations overcome sticking points which broke down talks last time. The relief rally had begun to peter out in Asia-Pac and European trade, with some aid from a surprise build in API stockpiles (+3.7mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln). WTI residing around its 50 DMAs at 56.08/bbl whilst its Brent counterpart remains around 60.50/bbl. PVM notes that if Brent fails to hold its 13 DMA (60.55/bbl), then it’ll likely cause a 5-day gap narrowing dip to around the 5 DMA at 59.29/bbl. Traders will now be looking ahead to the weekly DoE data for confirmation of the API numbers. ING notes that last week’s release saw a surprise build driven mainly by a fall in crude oil exports. “The relative strength in WTI vs. Brent, means we could see another week of poor exports”, analysts say. Elsewhere, gold has made some gains above the 1500/oz mark after finding a base at 1480/oz yesterday from the trade-driven unwind of safe-haven positions. Meanwhile, copper prices are on the backfoot as yesterday’s optimism wanes in EU trade and disappointing Chinese IP prints exacerbated the downside, with some additional pressure after exports of the red metal from Peruvian port of Matarani have now resumed following a three-week suspension due to protests.</p>",

        "subject": "Treasury 2s10s curve inverts for first time since 2007; BofAML says equity market is now ‘on borrowed time’",
        "content": "<ul><li>The US 2s10s part of the curve inverted in Wednesday pre-market trade, which investors have traditionally associated with an increase in recession risks. BofAML analysts note that 2s10s yield curve inversions have preceded the last seven recessions and nine out of the last 12 recessions.</li><li>BofAML says that the SPX can take time to peak after a yield curve inversion, noting that sometimes the S&amp;P 500 peaks within two-to-three months of a 2s10s inversion, but it can take one to two years for an S&amp;P 500 peak after an inversion. For the ten inversions back to 1956, the S&amp;P 500 topped out within approximately three months of the inversion six times (1956, 1959, 1965, 1973, 1980, and 2000), BofAML says, the S&amp;P 500 took 11 to 22 months to peak after the other four inversions (1967, 1978, 1989, and 2005).</li><li>BofAML says the equity market is on borrowed time after the yield curve inverts. \"However, after an initial post-inversion dip, the S&amp;P 500 can rally meaningfully prior to a bigger US recession related drawdown.\" The bank notes that the initial post-inversion drawdown is 5.2% on average (5.5% median) but has ranged from 0% (1980) to 10.5% (1978). \"These drawdowns typically last one to two months but have ranged from 0 (1980) to 5.8 months (1973).\" BofAML says that after the initial drawdown, the S&amp;P 500 can have a meaningful last gasp rally. \"This rally has averaged 16.7% (12.4% median) with a range of 2.0% (1965) to 28.5% (1989) and lasts 6.7 months on average (2.8 median) with a range of 0.9 to 16.5 months.\"</li><li>In terms of being an economic indicator, the bank says that while yield curve inversions can be a leading indicator of economic weakness or recession, they are at minimum an early warning sign. \"Going back to 1956 it has taken between eight (1959) and 24 months (1967) for a US recession to start after a yield curve inversion,\" BofAML writes, \"the average and median length of time from inversion to the start of a recession are 15.1 and 16.3 months, respectively. It took a year or more for a recession to begin after six of the ten inversions (1956, 1967, 1978, 1989, 2000, and 2005).\"</li><li>The bank notes that 2s10s spread follows a cycle of: 1) peaking and flattening to inversion, 2) spending time inverted and 3) steepening out of inversion to the yield curve peak. \"When 2s10s peaks and flattens to inversion, the S&amp;P 500 has had positive annualized returns 100% of the time averaging 16.82% (median 11.54%),\" and adds that \"when the curve is inverted, the S&amp;P 500 has had negative annualised returns 60% of the time averaging -2.05% (median -5.97%).\" Finally, BofAML says that when the 2s10s steepens out of inversion until the next spread peak, the S&amp;P 500 is up 80% of the time with average annualized returns of 17.17% (median 16.24%).</li></ul>",

Major bourses are posting broad-based losses although Italy’s FTSE MIB (-1.9%) is underperforming, as the ongoing political angst sees almost all Italian stocks in the red. Meanwhile, DAX 30 (-1.4%) breached the key 11,600 support level on which the index turned-around during the May rout. Sectors are all in negative territory, although defensive sectors are somewhat more resilient, i.e. utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. In terms of individual movers, Commerzbank (-4.0%) fell to a new record low of EUR 5/shr as the German banking rout deepens following a Germany GDP Q/Q contraction and as the bank tracks German yields. Meanwhile, Balfour Beatty (+9.0%) and RWE (+1.9%) rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 after earnings, with the latter raising its interim dividend.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong> - The traditional safe-haven currencies and their commodity compatriot Gold have regained some composure after yesterday’s sharp/abrupt fall from grace on the resumption of US-China trade talks and decision to defer/waiver certain items from the list of Chinese imports that were due for 10% tariffs on September 1. Subsequent comments from President Trump indicate that the concessions are not in response to any progress in negotiations or reciprocity from Beijing, but an effort to avoid US consumers feeling the pinch over the festive period. Meanwhile, latest Chinese data has also dampened spirits with ip and retail sales both falling short of expectations, though the PBoC has stalled the measured Yuan depreciation and Usd/Cny ended on-shore trade below the official fix. Usd/Jpy back down around 106.50 and Usd/Chf is pivoting 0.9750 as Xau/Usd returns to the 1500/oz mark amidst faltering risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/SEK/NOK</strong> - The single currency and Sterling are both firmer vs the Dollar even though the DXY is holding the bulk of its post-US CPI gains within a 97.847-720 range, and data has helped to an extent given Eurozone Q2 GDP matching or slightly surpassing forecasts, while headline UK inflation was firmer than consensus along with the core. However, Eur/Usd and Cable remain top-heavy ahead of 1.1200 and 1.2100, with the former still unable to breach Fib resistance at 1.1220 convincingly or on a closing basis, and also faced with decent option expiry interest today at 1.1215 (1.3 bn). Similarly, the Swedish Krona only got a fleeting boost from CPIF beats vs market medians and the Riksbank’s own projection, as inflated food prices were partly if not largely to blame, while another retreat in crude prices is weighing on its Norwegian peer, as Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok hover closer to the tops of 10.7145-6455 and 9.9715-9085 bands respectively.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong> - The aforementioned tempered exuberance surrounding US-China relations and disappointing data have taken their toll of the Aussie in particular, with Aud/Usd recoiling from 0.6800+ recovery peaks towards 0.6750 again, Nzd/Usd back under 0.6450 and Usd/Cad rebounding from sub-1.3200 to just shy of 1.3250. Ahead, Australian jobs data will be crucial for the RBA, and at the current juncture it appears that a hefty 0.6790 expiry in 1.2 bn won’t have a bearing on direction.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>The debt rally has resumed in full force with multi-year and/or uncharted territory in futures and cash yields trading extensively, while key segments of the curve have now crossed the zero divide. For the record, <strong>Bunds</strong> have been up to 178.14, <strong>Gilts</strong> as high as 134.63, but still some way shy of the 135.01 contract high and 10 year <strong>Treasuries</strong> 130-085 at best. Ahead, more price data via US import and export readings, but it’s all about sentiment and whether Wall Street picks up where it left off yesterday or takes fright given latest bond market moves and the heightened risk of recession implied by the rate depression and spread compression.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> prices have held onto the bulk of their trade-driven gains in which the benchmarks soared around USD 3/bbl after the USTR decided to delay tariffs on some Chinese goods until December 15th. Sentiment drove yesterday’s gains, although ultimately, the demand outlook remains unchanged unless material progress can be made in dialogue, i.e. if the nations overcome sticking points which broke down talks last time. The relief rally had begun to peter out in Asia-Pac and European trade, with some aid from a surprise build in API stockpiles (+3.7mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln). WTI resides in-between its 50 and 200 DMAs (at 56.08/bbl and 57.68/bbl)&nbsp; whilst its Brent counterpart remains just north of 60.50/bbl. PVM notes that if Brent fails to hold its 13 DMA (60.55/bbl), then it’ll likely cause a 5-day gap narrowing dip to around the 5 DMA at 59.29/bbl. Traders will now be looking ahead to the weekly DoE data for confirmation of the API numbers. ING notes that last week’s release saw a surprise build driven mainly by a fall in crude oil exports. “The relative strength in WTI vs. Brent, means we could see another week of poor exports”, the analysts say. Elsewhere, gold has flat-lined at around the 1500/oz mark after finding a base at 1480/oz yesterday from the trade-driven unwind of safe-haven positions. Meanwhile, copper prices are on the backfoot as yesterday’s optimism wanes in EU trade and disappointing Chinese IP prints exacerbated the downside, with some additional pressure after exports of the red metal from Peruvian port of Matarani have now resumed following a three-week suspension due to protests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*THE LATEST</strong>: Italian PM Conte will appear before the Senate on Tuesday 20th August, as lawmakers debate the confidence motion against the government. Lawmakers were expected to set a date for a confidence vote yesterday, although some say the PM’s appearance next week could lead to an upper house confidence vote. A motion to vote on Wednesday by League Leader Salvini was voted down yesterday – Salvini had been seeking a rapid confidence vote that would lead to quick elections (Oct 13) and allow his League Party to capitalise on gains at the polls and influence the 2020 Budget.</p><p><strong>*OLIVE BRANCH:</strong> Salvini proposed accepting 5SM's demand for a parliamentary reform in return for quick elections, a measure seen as an olive branch to progress proceedings; the proposal will see the number of MPs in both houses cut from 945 to 600, this has been approved by parliament on three occasions, with the fourth vote due in September. HSBC says that completing this reform would mean elections could not take place for another 5 to 6 months at least, due to the need to allow a possible referendum to be called, and to re-draw the electoral council boundaries.</p><p><strong>*WHAT NOW:</strong> Ultimately President Mattarella will decide the way forward, i.e. who can seek to form an alternate ruling coalition or call a general election. Once lawmakers debate the motion, the no-confidence vote is expected to pass as it is likely that Conte’s government no longer has majority.</p><p><strong>*TECHNOCRATIC/COALITION</strong>: The real question is whether the President will opt for a technocratic government to pass the Autumn 2020 budget or whether Italians head to ballots. Polls register Salvini’s League between 36-38%, with a snap election upping the prospect of an outright majority in both branches of parliament. However, analysts note that an alliance with the Brothers of Italy (far-right) might provide some comfort, add to that the Forza Italia (centre-right), Salvini may reach the 2/3 majority required to amend Italy’s constitution. Although overnight, Forza Italia stated that it will no longer support Salvini. &nbsp;Brothers of Italy had previously pledged support to the League leader.</p><p><strong>*PD DILEMMA:</strong> PD (centre-left) are also likely to back the no-confidence vote, as polling suggests it could leave them as primary opposition rather than Di-Maio’s 5SM; a PD/5SM tie up is unlikely given that the two parties have been at odds on almost every major issue. PD Leader Renzi earlier this month pledged to avoid imminent elections, whilst noting that a technocratic government should be formed to pass the Autumn 2020 budget and avoid a 3% VAT tax hike. Italian press has however speculated about a potential split in the Democratic Party. Some members in the PD believe that avoiding the tax hike via a technocratic government will ultimately play into Salvini’s hand and his pledge for flat taxes. Former PD Development Minister Calenda has firmly rejected the PD leader’s plan, stating that “it will give Salvini 60% at the next election”.</p>",

There was much attention on the 2s10s part of the Treasury curve, which came to within 1 bps of inversion, before US/China news allowed a bounce. However, at settlement, the gap is around 2bps, keeping the threat of inversion alive. The 3m/10-year part of the curve was also in focus, but is already inverted, of course; the gap here went as deep as -40bps in overnight trade, but has pared back to around -33bps amid more constructive risk sentiment. The long-end of the curve continues to gain attention, with yields down to fresh 37-month lows. This has also been a focus of equity traders; with regards to the 10s sector, Goldman Sachs noted that the S&amp;P 500 currently offers a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.0% – higher than the 10-year US Treasury yield for the first time since October 2016. At settlement, major US curve spreads had tightened, with 2s30 narrowing by around 6bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 17+ lower at 129-26+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board with global risk appetite spurred by a de-escalation in the US-China trade war after the US announced to delay the 10% tariffs on some items from China until December 15th, although Chinese data threatens to cloud over the region. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) are higher but with upside in Australia capped by weakness in financials after NAB reported tepid profit growth for Q3 and as gold miners suffer from a pullback in the precious metal, while Tokyo sentiment is also boosted by encouraging data after Machinery Orders showed the largest M/M increase on record. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were also buoyed at the open after the tariff delay announcement in which President Trump noted was for the Christmas season in case it had an impact on shopping and suggested that he had a very productive call with China, while a continued PBoC liquidity effort and firmer CNY fix added to the optimism before weaker than expected Industrial Production and Retail Sales data from China saw stocks give back some of the gains.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady and holds on to most the prior day’s gains following the recent firmer than expected US CPI data and encouraging US-China trade developments, while its major transatlantic counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD and GBP/USD little changed at the 1.1100 and 1.2000 handles respectively amid ongoing uncertainty related to Italian politics and the Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have slightly pulled-back overnight on profit taking after having surged nearly 2 points in reaction to the tariff delay, while antipodeans are relatively flat with AUD/USD contained by resistance at the 0.6800 level and after firmer than expected Australian Wage Price Index is counterbalanced by the Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data miss.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower after the US tariff delay triggered safehaven outflows and amid continued lack of BoJ buying with the central bank in the market today for only Treasury Bills.</p>",
