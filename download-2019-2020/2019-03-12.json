PM May later said she is committed to holding other votes this week and that if the house votes for an extension, the government will seek to agree it with the EU. Elsewhere, a spokesperson said PM May has not discussed resigning which followed reports that some Tory lawmakers were said to be mulling approaching UK PM May in a delegation to ask her to resign.

Further upside was seen in the complex after a solid 10-year auction, which stopped through the screens by 0.8bps. Analysts noted that real yields came in after a soft CPI report, with many suggesting that there isn't anything to suggest we are facing a spike higher in price pressures any time soon. Additionally, one trader noted that banks were said to be receiving in size, and corporate issuance was being swapped into floating rates, with the perception that yields will continue to fall. 10-year yields dropped beneath 2.60% - we haven't had a close beneath that level since early January. At settlement the cure bull-flattened. US T-note futures (M9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 122-28.</p>",

The implication is that this makes a cliff-edged, no-deal Brexit less likely. On Wednesday, the UK is expected to vote on ruling out a no-deal Brexit, and following that, on Thursday, lawmakers will vote on extending the Article 50 process, which again, is expected. The knee-jerk reaction for the pound was positive, however, the post-vote gains were faded after reports that the remaining votes this week will be amendable, implying it is unclear at this stage what the final bill will look like. Additionally, it was reported by the Sunday Times that UK PM May will vote against leaving without a deal. Note, the situation remains fluid, and at pixel time, GBP remains volatile. There was also chatter that some Tory lawmakers are set to appraoch UK PM May in a delegation to ask her to resign.</p><p>* <strong>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?:</strong> As things stand, if MPs vote to extend the Article 50 process, in addition to the UK’s approval, every EU member would be required to agree. The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to 18 April – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to 23 May has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit become possible. A push to the end of June – 23rd is capturing imagines since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in early July, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.</p><p><strong>* USTR TESTIMONY: </strong>US Trade Representative Lighthizer testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee today where he said there are still major issues between the US and China - with a deal being a “big if” - but hopes the countries are in the final weeks of having an agreement, although that if talks are not resolved then there will be no agreement. Lighthizer also said that President Trump will not agree to deal unless it is enforceable. Looking into progress of specific issues, the trade hardliner said that structural IP issues are being addressed “with precision” in talks; in addition the two nations have come very close to a currency agreement, and as it stands, China's currency agreement has real commitments and is enforceable. In regard to China’s requests, as expected, he said they are seeking the removal of tariffs, which “if that is a concession, that is something that is under debate.”</p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>US February consumer prices was a touch softer than expected, with the headline at 1.5% YY, down from a prior and consensus 1.6%; the core measure fell to 2.1% YY from the consensus and prior 2.2%. \"With headline CPI inflation edging down to a two-and-a-half-year low of 1.5% in February, and core inflation dropping to a four-month low of 2.1%, the Fed would appear to be justified in supporting the real economy by being patient and leaving interest rates on hold for a potentially extended period,\" Capital Economics said. The consultancy says that the headline was down on base effects, noting that MM growth came in 0.2%, driven by rises in food and energy prices; ex food and energy, the monthly rise was more muted at 0.1% MM. \"Although the unemployment rate is back below 4% and average hourly earnings growth has accelerated to nearly 3.5%, there appears to be very little upward pressure on price inflation,\" CapEco says, explaining that this is partly due to a modest pick-up in productivity growth which has kept a lid on unit labour costs; additionally, the stronger USD has started to put downward pressure on imported goods prices. \"If a US-China trade deal results in the removal of the tariffs introduced last year, that would introduce an additional source of disinflationary pressure,\" Capital Economics says, \"in short, the Fed can safely ignore the minimal risk of a breakout in inflation above its 2% target.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES: </strong>ECB unlikely to decide on the final TLTRO conditions before June and policymakers will calibrate based on growth figures; according to sources. The committee proposed new TLTRO premium 25bps over the main refinancing rate, however governors pushed back as it was \"too high\". The piece added that the best TLTRO rate not seen going below zero, discussions still ongoing and growth weakness can change terms. The key goal of TLTRO is to reduce stock of loans to avoid a cliff edge effect in the future, and the article added that the ECB did not discuss tiered deposit only one governor expressed deep concern about negative rates.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLED USD 0.08 HIGHER AT USD 56.87/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.09 HIGHER AT USD 66.67. </strong>The crude complex traded choppy on Tuesday whilst the market digested various conflicting catalysts. On the one hand, prices were supported reports of Saudi production running a clear step below its 10.3mln BPD OPEC+ production target, and the further decline in Venezuelan oil production on the power outages of the past week. UAE’s Oil Minister said the OPEC+ deal compliance is improving, and Interfax reported that an extension of the deal for H2 2019 may be made in April. Crude was also helped by a weaker dollar after February CPI data showed some softness. On the other hand, global demand was again in concern: the EIA cut its world oil demand growth forecast for 2019 by 40k BPD to a 1.45mln BPD YY increase, as well as its 2020 forecast by 20k BPD to a 1.46mln BPD YY increase. In other news-flow it was reported that Nigeria’s Nembe Creek Trunk Line (150k BPD) resumed operations since being down from February 28th. The market is also looking ahead to this evenings API figures of US energy inventories, where crude stocks are again seen building at 2.7mln bbls, distillates drawing 1.9mln bbls, gasoline drawing 2.5mln bbls; Genscape forecasts the Cushing delivery hub building 671k bbls. Elsewhere, it was reported that OPEC has begun speaking to Wall Street in regard to NOPEC legislation, warning of US shale being the first to fall from such measures.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.30% at 2792, NDX +0.52% at 7201, DJI -0.38% at 25555. SECTORS: Energy +0.58%, Materials +0.35%, Industrials -0.90%, Cons Discretionary +0.23%, Cons Staples -0.02%, Healthcare +0.67%, Financials +0.19%, Tech +0.52%, Telecoms +0.56%, Utilities +0.62%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) continued its sell-off on Tuesday as the list of countries grounding its 737 Max 8 jet countries grew larger; Southwest (LUV) and United Airlines (UAL), whose fleets are largely composed of the jet, both traded lower too. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) opened in the green after finding relief on the back of the EU dropping plans to introduce a digital tax on big tech. Tesla (TSLA) came under pressure following Morgan Stanley cutting delivery estimates. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) enjoyed some spicy gains on the launch of its new loyalty programme. HP Enterprise (HPE), F5 Networks (FFIV) and Monster Beverage (MNST) all suffered from downgrades at UBS, JPMorgan and BMO Capital respectively.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 122-28. </strong>The bid in Treasuries were particularly strong on Tuesday, despite equities trading higher. Further upside was seen in the complex after a solid 10-year auction, which stopped through the screens by 0.8bps. Analysts noted that real yields came in after a soft CPI report, with many suggesting that there isn't anything to suggest we are facing a spike higher in price pressures any time soon. Additionally, one trader noted that banks were said to be receiving in size, and corporate issuance was being swapped into floating rates, with the perception that yields will continue to fall. 10-year yields dropped beneath 2.60% - we haven't had a close beneath that level since early January. At settlement the cure bull-flattened.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: 30-YEAR AUCTION (USD 16BLN, WEDNESDAY) 1300 EDT/1700 GMT):</strong> The previous 30-year auction in February stopped on the screws, with cover in-line with recent averages. The recent steepening of the curve might provide some support for the auction, analysts said. Foreign investors’ participation was higher (10% vs 4% at the January auction), and domestic participation slipped to 61% from the record high of 67%. “However, looking through the month-to-month volatility, domestic investors accounted for 63% over the past three months, versus 60% over the past year,” Barclays points out, adding that “On-the-run 30s are trading at a liquidity discount to old 30s (Nov 2048) in the forward space, which we think is justified, given that the latter is a CTD in deferred WN contracts.”</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> UK PM May's Brexit deal was rejected by a margin of 149. The implication is that this makes a cliff-edged, no-deal Brexit less likely. On Wednesday, the UK is expected to vote on ruling out a no-deal Brexit, and following that, on Thursday, lawmakers will vote on extending the Article 50 process, which again, is expected. The knee-jerk reaction for the pound was positive, however, the post-vote gains were faded after reports that the remaining votes this week will be amendable, implying it is unclear at this stage what the final bill will look like. Additionally, it was reported by the Sunday Times that UK PM May will vote against leaving without a deal. Note, the situation remains fluid, and at pixel time, GBP remains volatile. There was also chatter that some Tory lawmakers are set to appraoch UK PM May in a delegation to ask her to resign.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The haven bid saw some relief with constructive risk sentiment. There are, of course, domestic factors bubbling away that lend to some downside, too. A Bloomberg poll shows there is a growing expectation that the BOK will add more stimilus; BBG noted that in the poll, 37% of the 46 economists surveyed say te next policy move at BOJ towers will be an easing vs 18% who held that view in January.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Overnight, data on the housing front disappointed (again), and the NAB February confidence print was not great, either. With that said, Aussie was trading firmer through European and US trading. Short-covering was cited (again), and some constructive risk sentiment. Analysts at WEstpac are now focussing on AUDJPY: \"AUD has held its ground quite well against JPY in recent weeks given the aggressive move in interest rate markets to price in substantial risk of RBA rate cuts since the early Feb change of RBA policy bias and clear signs of slower growth in the Australian economy,\" and adds that \"RBA rate cut talk should remain the key topic for AUD in coming weeks, though the focus is very much on Jul-Aug as the likely window for the first move and a cut is already fully priced by Sep-Oct.\" The Aussie bank notes that with AUD's commodity price support also driving large trade surpluses, JPY weakness may be the driver of the next sustained move on AUDJPY. \"Spec positioning on USDJPY is helpfully balanced and market talk about looser monetary policy could pick up ahead of the BoJ's quarterly forecast release at the 24-25 Apr meeting,\" WEstpac says, \"AUDJPY 80 looks like strong resistance in the short-term, but it should be broken, with scope for 81+ in April.\"</p><p><strong>* SEK:</strong> Swedish inflation surprised to the downside for a second straight month with international travel responsible for most of the downside. \"This is a technical effect explained by a change in the data source introduced in January,\" SEB explains, \"the impact on the inflation rate is, however, likely to lower the inflation number until December this year.\" Taking international travel inflation out of the picture, food prices and some services prices were higher than expected, though goods prices (clothes) saw a downside surprise. \"Clothes prices are volatile and the lower prices this month are likely to be reversed during the spring. Food prices are, however, likely to continue to rise leading to some upward pressure on the near-term forecast,\" SEB says. \"The composition of price changes indicates that near term inflation pressures could be slightly larger than expected. Still, price pressures are lower than the Riksbank’s forecast, and today’s reading supports our forecast that the Riksbank will wait until next year before hiking again.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Ahead of next week;s Norges Bank meeting, the February Regional Network Survey's output index fell fell slightly. \"This points to quarterly mainland GDP growth of around 0.73% going forward, which is a little higher than the Norges Bank assumed in its December monetary policy report,\" Danske Bank said. Meanwhile, the aggregate output score for the last three months ticked higher, implying growth at around 0.72% QQ, highlighting that growth has been resilient at the beginning of the year, Danske noted. \"All in all, a strong report confirming our projection of a March rate hike next week,\" Danske said, \"at this stage, domestic factors suggest the front-end will remain little changed and that market pricing hence is too soft.\" The bank has previously recommended selling EUR/NOK via a 2M bearish risk reversal.\"</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> Data today showed Brazilian IPCA inflation rising 0.4% MM, in line with expectations, and the YY rising by 3.9% vs 3.8% previously. The data was mainly driven by school fees and food prices, which offset the drag from declining transportation costs and clothing prices. \"Tuition fees rose 3.5% month-to-month in February, reflecting the annual adjustment, but this was smaller than the 3.9% rise in February 2018 and the 5.0% jump in 2017,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics says, \"food prices rose by 0.8%, in contrast to the 0.3% drop in February 2018, due to higher prices for food consumed at home.\" The consultancy says that overall, the trend in inflation should be stable over the next three months, as a lagged response to soft growth and still-high unemployment. \"We see no immediate threats here, except some potential volatility in the FX market driven by news on progress with the fiscal reform agenda,\" but adds that \"if reforms are approved over the second half of the year, as we expect, inflation will remain relatively tame, thanks to modest demand-related pressures, and the ample—albeit shrinking—output gap.\" Pantheon says that this will likely continue to lend support to the argument that the BCB will keep rates unchanged for the foreseeable future. More immediately, attention now moves on to Friday, when th government plans to auction 12 airports, followed by railroads and other ports later in the month. Some analysts note that a successful auction will bolster new President Bolsonaro's pro business credentials, supporting the BRL.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> There were some murmurings in the APAC time zone of a call between China Vice Premier Liu He and US Trade Rep Lighthizer, and although now real detail came of the report, it was enough to inspire a 'US/China trade talks optimism' response. Both apparently discussed the content of the trade agreement, and agreed on further talks. CNK noted that there was some injection of volatility into the USDCNY, as a result, noting that over the past few weeks, the currency pair had remained fairly stable, with realised volatility remaining at subdued levels. \"However, as there is little concrete information for the time being, volatility is unlikely to sustain and market will probably return to the mute mode soon,\" Commerzbank said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "FX ANALYSIS: GBP roller-coaster continues (GBP, JPY, AUD, SEK, NOK, AUD, BRL, CNY)",
        "content": "<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>UK PM May's Brexit deal was rejected by a margin of 149. The implication is that this makes a cliff-edged, no-deal Brexit less likely. On Wednesday, the UK is expected to vote on ruling out a no-deal Brexit, and following that, on Thursday, lawmakers will vote on extending the Article 50 process, which again, is expected. The knee-jerk reaction for the pound was positive, however, the post-vote gains were faded after reports that the remaining votes this week will be amendable, implying it is unclear at this stage what the final bill will look like. Additionally, it was reported by the Sunday Times that UK PM May will vote against leaving without a deal. Note, the situation remains fluid, and at pixel time, GBP remains volatile. There was also chatter that some Tory lawmakers are set to appraoch UK PM May in a delegation to ask her to resign.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The haven bid saw some relief with constructive risk sentiment. There are, of course, domestic factors bubbling away that lend to some downside, too. A Bloomberg poll shows there is a growing expectation that the BOK will add more stimilus; BBG noted that in the poll, 37% of the 46 economists surveyed say te next policy move at BOJ towers will be an easing vs 18% who held that view in January.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Overnight, data on the housing front disappointed (again), and the NAB February confidence print was not great, either. With that said, Aussie was trading firmer through European and US trading. Short-covering was cited (again), and some constructive risk sentiment. Analysts at WEstpac are now focussing on AUDJPY: \"AUD has held its ground quite well against JPY in recent weeks given the aggressive move in interest rate markets to price in substantial risk of RBA rate cuts since the early Feb change of RBA policy bias and clear signs of slower growth in the Australian economy,\" and adds that \"RBA rate cut talk should remain the key topic for AUD in coming weeks, though the focus is very much on Jul-Aug as the likely window for the first move and a cut is already fully priced by Sep-Oct.\" The Aussie bank notes that with AUD's commodity price support also driving large trade surpluses, JPY weakness may be the driver of the next sustained move on AUDJPY. \"Spec positioning on USDJPY is helpfully balanced and market talk about looser monetary policy could pick up ahead of the BoJ's quarterly forecast release at the 24-25 Apr meeting,\" WEstpac says, \"AUDJPY 80 looks like strong resistance in the short-term, but it should be broken, with scope for 81+ in April.\"</p><p><strong>* SEK: </strong>Swedish inflation surprised to the downside for a second straight month with international travel responsible for most of the downside. \"This is a technical effect explained by a change in the data source introduced in January,\" SEB explains, \"the impact on the inflation rate is, however, likely to lower the inflation number until December this year.\" Taking international travel inflation out of the picture, food prices and some services prices were higher than expected, though goods prices (clothes) saw a downside surprise. \"Clothes prices are volatile and the lower prices this month are likely to be reversed during the spring. Food prices are, however, likely to continue to rise leading to some upward pressure on the near-term forecast,\" SEB says. \"The composition of price changes indicates that near term inflation pressures could be slightly larger than expected. Still, price pressures are lower than the Riksbank’s forecast, and today’s reading supports our forecast that the Riksbank will wait until next year before hiking again.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Ahead of next week;s Norges Bank meeting, the February Regional Network Survey's output index fell fell slightly. \"This points to quarterly mainland GDP growth of around 0.73% going forward, which is a little higher than the Norges Bank assumed in its December monetary policy report,\" Danske Bank said. Meanwhile, the aggregate output score for the last three months ticked higher, implying growth at around 0.72% QQ, highlighting that growth has been resilient at the beginning of the year, Danske noted. \"All in all, a strong report confirming our projection of a March rate hike next week,\" Danske said, \"at this stage, domestic factors suggest the front-end will remain little changed and that market pricing hence is too soft.\" The bank has previously recommended selling EUR/NOK via a 2M bearish risk reversal.\"</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>Data today showed Brazilian IPCA inflation rising 0.4% MM, in line with expectations, and the YY rising by 3.9% vs 3.8% previously. The data was mainly driven by school fees and food prices, which offset the drag from declining transportation costs and clothing prices. \"Tuition fees rose 3.5% month-to-month in February, reflecting the annual adjustment, but this was smaller than the 3.9% rise in February 2018 and the 5.0% jump in 2017,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics says, \"food prices rose by 0.8%, in contrast to the 0.3% drop in February 2018, due to higher prices for food consumed at home.\" The consultancy says that overall, the trend in inflation should be stable over the next three months, as a lagged response to soft growth and still-high unemployment. \"We see no immediate threats here, except some potential volatility in the FX market driven by news on progress with the fiscal reform agenda,\" but adds that \"if reforms are approved over the second half of the year, as we expect, inflation will remain relatively tame, thanks to modest demand-related pressures, and the ample—albeit shrinking—output gap.\" Pantheon says that this will likely continue to lend support to the argument that the BCB will keep rates unchanged for the foreseeable future. More immediately, attention now moves on to Friday, when th government plans to auction 12 airports, followed by railroads and other ports later in the month. Some analysts note that a successful auction will bolster new President Bolsonaro's pro business credentials, supporting the BRL.</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>There were some murmurings in the APAC time zone of a call between China Vice Premier Liu He and US Trade Rep Lighthizer, and although now real detail came of the report, it was enough to inspire a 'US/China trade talks optimism' response. Both apparently discussed the content of the trade agreement, and agreed on further talks. CNK noted that there was some injection of volatility into the USDCNY, as a result, noting that over the past few weeks, the currency pair had remained fairly stable, with realised volatility remaining at subdued levels. \"However, as there is little concrete information for the time being, volatility is unlikely to sustain and market will probably return to the mute mode soon,\" Commerzbank said.&nbsp;</p>",

POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?: As things stand, if MPs vote to extend the Article 50 process, in addition to the UK’s approval, every EU member would be required to agree. The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to 18 April – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to 23 May has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit become possible. A push to the end of June – 23rd is capturing imagines since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in early July, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.</li></ul>",

On the one hand, prices were supported reports of Saudi production running a clear step below its 10.3mln BPD OPEC+ production target, and the further decline in Venezuelan oil production on the power outages of the past week. UAE’s Oil Minister said the OPEC+ deal compliance is improving, and Interfax reported that an extension of the deal for H2 2019 may be made in April. Crude was also helped by a weaker dollar after February CPI data showed some softness. On the other hand, global demand was again in concern: the EIA cut its world oil demand growth forecast for 2019 by 40k BPD to a 1.45mln BPD YY increase, as well as its 2020 forecast by 20k BPD to a 1.46mln BPD YY increase. In other news-flow it was reported that Nigeria’s Nembe Creek Trunk Line (150k BPD) resumed operations since being down from February 28th. The market is also looking ahead to this evenings API figures of US energy inventories, where crude stocks are again seen building at 2.7mln bbls, distillates drawing 1.9mln bbls, gasoline drawing 2.5mln bbls; Genscape forecasts the Cushing delivery hub building 671k bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* VOTE TIME: </strong>Expected to begin at around 1900 GMT (1500 EDT, 2000 CET).</p><p><strong>* AMENDMENTS: </strong>There are no ammendments tabled, and as such, it will be a 'clean' vote on May's Brexit plan.</p><p><strong>* VOTING MATHS:</strong> There are 650 members of the UK House of Commons, seven Sinn Fein MPs do not vote, four speakers do not vote, and four MPs who count the votes do not vote themselves. PM May needs 318 votes to pass her deal, assuming all lawmakers (who are able to) vote, including: 10 DUP votes, up to 65 ERG votes (from a total of 110), up to 40 Labour leave votes, and 4 Independent votes.</p><p><strong>* VOTE MARGIN: </strong>May's Brexit bill was rejected overwhelmingly in January, by a margin of 230 votes (432 against vs 202 in favour). One theory is that if the margin of defeat is small, it may give May scope to make changes after the 21 March EU Summit, so the deal could be voted on again. However, ITV's political editor suggested that the vote would be lost by more than 100, leaving little scope for May to introduce a third meaningful vote. Sky News analysis suggests UK PM May will lose tonight's vote by more than 100 votes (projects 345 to vote against deal, 220 will vote for deal, 72 unknown).</p><p><strong>* AG COX: </strong>UK AG Cox noted thta while the path to exit the backstop is clear and binding, and the likelihood of a EU/UK disagreement in the arbitration process is low, and a unilateral right to exit the backstop was not achieved. NOTE: a unilateral right to leave was a key red-line for the ERG and DUP, the likely king-makers in the upcoming meaningful vote. The ERG and DUP have both therefore said that they will not back the deal; the DUP will directly vote against, but some members of the ERG may abstain from the vote (the latter is likely to be more beneficial to UK PM May).</p><p><strong>* CHANCES OF PASSING TODAY: </strong>Betting markets price in defeat for PM May. The implied probability of her deal passing fell to around 11% (vs 25-30% before the AG's opinion was published. Accordingly, many desks say the base case is still for the deal to be rejected on Tuesday, a no-deal Brexit ruled out on Wednesday, and lawmakers will vote for the Article 50 process to be extended on Thursday.</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 1: </strong>Meaningful Vote fails (Tue)/no-deal blocked (Wed/Thu)/vote to extend A50 passes (Wed/Thu) (likely). Barclays says initial GBP reaction would be negative. Focus will then shift to 21 March summit, where any signs of a longer extension could lead to a rally.</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 2: </strong>Meaningful Vote passes (somewhat likely). Barclays says it could open the door for new post-referendum highs.</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 3:</strong> All votes fail (unlikely). Barclays sees GBP real effective exchange rate -2.5% as markets price higher probability of no-deal Brexit. Focus then shifts to 21 March summit where GBP will be almost entirely sensitive to Brexit newsflow.</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 4: </strong>meaningful vote fails/MPs vote for no-deal (highly unlikely): Barclays says GBP REER -5%.</p><p><strong>* WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?: </strong>If MPs vote to extend the Article 50 process, in addition to the UK’s approval, every EU member would be required to agree. The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to 18 April – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to 23 May has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit become possible. A push to the end of June – 23rd is capturing imagines since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in early July, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.</p>",

Sterling kicked off Tuesday’s session in fine fettle following a last minute breakthrough in Strasbourg on the Irish backstop, but the reaction to legally binding assurances from the EU designed to allay fears about the ‘temporary’ or contingency arrangement was mixed, with many sceptics waiting for the thoughts of Attorney General Cox before deciding which way to sway. Indeed, the ERG and DUP, seen as swing voters, indicated that his considered opinion would impact their decisions, even though the former already received negative legal advice from an independent counsel. In the event, Cox deemed that there is no change in the legal risks of Britain getting trapped in the backstop given no unilateral recourse, and even though there has been clear clarification via a binding reinforcement of the UK’s legal rights. Nevertheless, highlighting substantive changes to the original WA and Political Declaration that make it easier for the UK to terminate the arrangement via arbitration the AG urged MPs to vote for the revised deal on political vs legal grounds. However, the DUP and ERG have subsequently signalled a thumbs down vs other individuals that seem inclined to back the deal this time round even if the motive is due to a no deal being the worse of 2 evils.&nbsp; Cable is currently circa 1.3125 and the cross around 0.8585. Note, the ERG have set a time of 18.00GMT to make a final decision according to latest reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has extended recovery gains vs the Usd through 0.6850 to 0.6870, partly on the back of another post-US data Greenback decline (<strong>DXY </strong>towards the base of a 97.286-96.900 range) and amidst latest US-Chinese trade commentary courtesy of USTR Lighthizer suggesting the 2 sides are close to a deal on FX. Aud/Usd also grinding higher and not far from 0.7100 at one stage on the same bullish combination, the Aussie hampered again by cross-winds as Aud/Nzd edges down towards 1.0300.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>The Franc and single currency are benefiting from the Dollar’s demise to a degree as well, with Usd/Chf retreating further from 1.0100+ to just under 1.0070 and Eur/Usd firm within a 1.1245-90 band, but not really looking likely to test 1.1300 resistance or trigger expiry options at the big figure (1 bn). Note, no real reaction to ECB source of horse of the mouth comments from Praet that in truth did not add to the policy outlook or guidance offered last Thursday.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Loonie has continued to outperform, or rather rebound firmly vs its US counterpart post-conflicting February jobs data and is now more comfortably back over 1.3400, while Usd/Jpy remains rangebound between 111.10-45m and mostly anchored to the bottom, though not close enough to seriously stir any interest emanating from a 1.1 bn option expiry at the 111.00 strike.</p>",

No Fed add-ons.</p><p><strong>RECENT PERFORMANCE:</strong> The uncertain outlook, risk asset jitters, and the prospect of no Fed hikes on the horizon has supported front-end of the Treasury curve recently; the market prices no hikes this year, with pricing tilting towards cuts in 2020. TD Securities expects this week’s auctions to go well given their expectation for no further coupon auction size increases ahead, and the fact that rates have remained relatively stable.</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION (USD 24bln, Tuesday 1300 EDT/1700 GMT):</strong> The previous 10-year auction was weak, with cover matching a 12-month low, combined with a tail size at a 12-month high, with the latter largely a result of investment fund participation slipping. And the recent richening of the 10-year may keep investors side-lined; Barclays notes that on-the-runs are trading more special than older 10s when compared with previous auction cycles, and the bank argues that that suggests a build-up of a short base as the auction sets up. Barclays says it continues to maintain its recommendation to fade the liquidity premium in on-the-runs (the Feb 2029) vs. older 10s (the Aug 2028); “OnTR10s have cheapened 0.5bp in forward space. However, they still appear somewhat rich on the curve, especially if they do not end up trading as special as priced in the repo market.” Six auction averages: High-yield 2.954%, tail -0.2bps, cover 2.45x, dealers 25.8%, directs 10.6%, indirects 63.6%.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/f843e958-cd35-4888-9c0d-f0cf629b73e3.jpg\"></figure>",

This is of particular importance, as whilst the AG continually tried to eschew the values of the renegotiated path to a backstop exit, a unilateral right to leave is a key red-line for the ERG and DUP, the likely king-makers in the upcoming meaningful vote.</li><li>This was confirmed throughout the questions portion wherein the star chamber of the ERG stated that they would not support UK PM May’s deal, whilst the DUP also did not seem convinced by the assurances offered. As such the balance remains tiled toward a failure in today's meaningful vote (ITV’s Peston suggests by well over 100 votes) despite UK PM May’s intended satiation of concerns prior to the HoC questions. This, however, does not eliminate the chances of UK PM May’s deal passing at some point, as a smaller losing margin keeps the idea of a 3rd meaningful vote alive (prev. 230 vote loss).</li></ul><p><strong>ERG</strong></p><ul><li>Jacob Reese Mogg noted that it is too early to say if the deal is enough but is a move in the right direction.

Their Summary: 'In our opinion these measures:' &nbsp; &nbsp;do not allow the UK to terminate the backstop in the event that negotiations over its future relationship with the EU cannot be brought to a satisfactory conclusion &nbsp;do not provide the UK with a right to terminate the backstop at a time of its choosing, or indeed at any time, without the agreement of the EU</li><li><strong>ERG are said to be split on how to respond to AG Cox's legal advice; according to BBC's Assistant Political Editor Smith</strong></li></ul><p><strong>DUP</strong></p><ul><li>DUP source says <strong>it is unlikely DUP can back PM May's deal</strong> following AG Cox legal advice</li><li>DUP’s Wilson said PM May’s deal seems to fall short on what was promised, but will give due diligence on what has been said</li></ul><p><strong>Labour Party</strong></p><ul><li>Leader Corbyn noted that PM May’s agreement does not contain changes the Premier promised Parliament</li></ul><p><strong>Irish PM Varadkar</strong></p><ul><li>The agreements outcome is positive, hopes it will be endorsed by parliament and added the instrument does not undermine the backstop or applications</li></ul><p><strong>European Commission President Juncker</strong></p><ul><li>European Commission President Juncker told reporters that the legal add-on to the Brexit deal which stresses the temporary nature of the backstop, complements the withdrawal agreement without reopening it.

One aide was said to have predicted that if Labour tabled another motion of no confidence in the Government, Tories might vote for it to bring May down.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK'S VOTES:</strong> To avoid humiliation, plans are reportedly being drawn-up to offer lawmakers the chance to vote on a motion that would outline the deal it would like, in order to show the EU what terms could be acceptable to Parliament. There is also a possibility that if the Meaningful Vote is rejected on Tuesday, planned votes on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit and whether to extend Article 50 could be scrapped so May can attempt once more to try and secure concessions from the EU at the 21 March EU summit, The Times added.</p><ul><li><strong>GBP SCENARIO 1: Meaningful Vote fails (Tue)/no-deal blocked (Wed/Thu)/vote to extend A50 passes (Wed/Thu) (likely).</strong> Barclays says initial GBP reaction would be negative. Focus will then shift to 21 March summit, where any signs of a longer extension could lead to a rally.</li><li><strong>GBP SCENARIO 2: Meaningful Vote passes (somewhat likely).</strong> Barclays says it could open the door for new post-referendum highs.</li><li><strong>GBP SCENARIO 3: All votes fail (unlikely).</strong> Barclays sees GBP real effective exchange rate -2.5% as markets price higher probability of no-deal Brexit. Focus then shifts to 21 March summit where GBP will be almost entirely sensitive to Brexit newsflow.</li><li><strong>GBP SCENARIO 4: meaningful vote fails/MPs vote for no-deal (highly unlikely):</strong> Barclays says GBP REER -5%.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?:</strong> If MPs vote to extend the Article 50 process, in addition to the UK’s approval, every EU member would be required to agree. The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to <strong>18 April</strong> – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to <strong>23 May</strong> has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit become possible. A push to the end of <strong>June – 23rd </strong>is capturing imagines since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in <strong>early July</strong>, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.</p><p><strong>NORWAY STYLE:</strong> Meanwhile cross-party pro-EU lawmakers are said to be drawing up a new Brexit political declaration that commits the UK to a Norway style relationship with the EU, which could be tabled if May loses Tuesday's vote. And on the government side, Chancellor Philip Hammond is reportedly preparing a GBP 20bln 'bribe' in his budget, if May's deal is carried on Tuesday; the Chancellor had previously warned of a return to austerity if May's plans are rejected.</p><p><strong>NAMES IN THE FRAME TO REPLACE MAY:</strong> The four leading names to succeed May: current Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, current Home Secretary Sajid Javid, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab.</p>",

As such the balance remains tiled toward a failure in todays meaningful vote (ITV’s Peston suggests by well over 100 votes) despite UK PM May’s intended satiation of concerns prior to the HoC questions. This, however, does not eliminate the chances of UK PM May’s deal passing at some point, as a smaller losing margin keeps the idea of a 3rd meaningful vote alive (prev. 230 vote loss).</p>",

Furthermore, the Times reported that PM May is understood to have discussed the possibility of extending Article 50 with EU’s Juncker.

The currency had already been advancing the prior day to reclaim the 1.3000 handle and move back above its 200DMA with the gains later exacerbated on hopes as PM May travelled to Strasbourg for 11th hour talks with the EU. The news of an agreement then fuelled a rally to within a whisker of the 1.3300 level although <strong>GBP/USD</strong> has since pulled back from its highs, as some remained pessimistic considering the existing wording of the Withdrawal Agreement which was said to be unchanged with the EU just offering legal assurances to back it up. Furthermore, ERG’s Baker suggested the agreement fell short of what was expected and Labour Leader Corbyn also deemed the negotiations as a failure with PM May not delivering what she promised parliament, while focus shifts to Attorney General Cox’s legal advice on whether the UK could be trapped forever in the backstop which is seen to likely influence the outcome of tonight’s vote and with CBA warning a potential 8% drop in the currency if the deal gets rejected. The breakthrough initially dragged <strong>EUR/GBP</strong> to below the 0.8500 level where it eventually found support, while the greenback was the main fallout from the <strong>GBP</strong> strength in which the <strong>DXY</strong> briefly gave up the 97.00 level to the benefit of its major counterparts. Elsewhere, antipodeans are firmer but with upside capped in <strong>AUD/USD</strong> after NAB Business Confidence and Home Loans added to Australia’s recent cold streak of data releases, while <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> were elevated as risk sentiment spurred outflows from Japan’s haven currency.&nbsp;</p><p>Australian NAB Business Confidence Feb 2 (Prev. 4).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was also supported overnight but with the advances only marginal as the lack of safe-haven demand counterbalanced the effects of a weaker greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> outperformed on the firm risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>OPEC official said OPEC will maintain cuts to reduce global inventories</strong> and will talk about demand and supply balance, while the official added OPEC will continue cutting production and wants to see commercial stocks down. Furthermore, there were also comments by <strong>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo that the oil market rebalancing continues to be a work in progress and supply adjustments will continue this year</strong>.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The upbeat risk sentiment resulted to slight steepening in the Treasury curve (though 2s5s and 2s10s were a touch narrower). Analysts cited Powell’s positive comments on Friday (economy healthy), which contributed to some of the downside, though the main catalyst was likely equities bouncing back despite heavyweight Boeing trading red (see stock specifics). The Treasury sold new 3-year notes today at the lowest yield in a year; but although cover was in line with recent averages, the auction tailed by 0.4bps (average over the last six was 0.2bps tail). There wasn’t too much to take from the internals; indirect takedown rebounded on the month to the highest since December. US T-note futures (M9) settled 4 ticks lower at 122-20+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region takes impetus from the M&amp;A inspired tech-led rally on Wall St and with sentiment also underpinned on Brexit related optimism after UK PM May’s last-ditch effort to reach an agreement with the EU resulted in legally binding changes that is said to strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.8%) are positive with the energy sector leading in Australia on recent strength in oil prices and the Japanese benchmark outperforms with the JPY-risk dynamic in full swing. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) extend on recent gains as they conform to the heightened risk appetite and tech-kindled momentum, while there were also reports that China’s Vice Premier Liu He held a phone call with US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer to discuss key issues and set the next steps in working arrangements.</p><p>In FX markets, GBP/USD remains in the limelight after PM May secured legally-binding assurances from the EU regarding the Northern Ireland backstop. The currency had already been advancing the prior day to reclaim the 1.3000 handle and move back above its 200DMA with the gains later exacerbated on hopes as PM May travelled to Strasbourg for 11th hour talks with the EU. The news of an agreement then fuelled a rally to within a whisker of the 1.3300 level although GBP/USD has since pulled back from its highs as some remained pessimistic as reports noted the existing wording of the Withdrawal Agreement was unchanged with the EU just offering legal assurances to back it up. Furthermore, ERG’s Baker suggested the agreement fell short of what was expected and Labour Leader Corbyn also deemed the negotiations as a failure with PM May not delivering what she promised parliament, while focus shifts to Attorney General Cox’s legal advice on whether the UK could be trapped forever in the backstop which is seen to likely influence the outcome of tonight’s vote. This dragged EUR/GBP to below the 0.8500 level where it eventually found support, while the greenback is the main fallout from the GBP strength in which the DXY briefly gave up the 97.00 level to the benefit of its major counterparts. Elsewhere, antipodeans are firmer but with upside capped in AUD/USD after NAB Business Confidence and Home Loans added to the recent cold streak of data releases, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are elevated as risk sentiment spurs outflows from Japan’s haven currency.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs trade subdued with demand sapped amid the gains across riskier assets and with participants tentative ahead of today’s 5yr JGB auction.</p>",
