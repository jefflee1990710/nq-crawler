AMD (AMD) was firmer on reports that suggested Apple (AAPL) could begin using AMD processors for Macs, replacing Intel (INTC), reported Street Insider. Amazon (AMZN) has tapped a Sony (SNE) executive, Mike Hopkins, to lead its Prime Video, Movie and TV Studios. General Motors (GM) was named as Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas’s best pick, noting its zero-emission plan has the potential to push the stock to USD 100. Biogen (BIIB) was lower following a poor Alzheimer’s trial with Eli-Lilly (LLY) which failed to meet its primary endpoint; neither did a study from Roche (ROGN SW). Apple (AAPL) opened lower following reports its cheaper iPhone may have to be postponed due to the coronavirus, but later rose with risk appetite.

The T-Note found its lows in the overnight before the Western front came and brought it back to highs as equity futures drifted lower somewhat before the cash open. However, the equity complex turned positive not long after the open, coinciding with strength in the greenback, keeping the 10-year yield anchored around 1.56% for a short while before it continued to move lower through till settlement, taking it just beneath 1.55%; curve spreads were little changed, with the belly seeing a slightly larger bid than the short and long end.

The Chinese Commerce Ministry said there is no reason to adopt intervention policies on international trade amid the outbreak - echoing prior WHO commentary. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi said China will adopt more decisive measures to contain the spread of the virus in the Hubei province and will be speeding up the development of clinically effective drugs. Xi added that Beijing’s city government should take targeted measures to curb the increasing risk of the spread of the virus after the return from holiday; additionally, Xi said they are to prevent large-scale layoffs, and the long-term improving momentum of the Chinese economy has not changed. State media also reported that it would speed up the provision of medicines that display clinical effects within the coronavirus outbreak. Asia trade was subdued on Monday, but not tumultuous, with desks noting a decline in the growth rate of cases, although some also draw attention to the validity/accuracy of the figures, participants are finding some solace in the CPC’s latest containment measures. Additionally, the PBoC is maintaining its stimulative policy, announcing it would be offering the first round of special re-lending funds to combat the coronavirus, becoming available weekly to banks later this month. Furthermore, an advisor hinted that the PBoC could cut its deposit rate but gave little further details.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Harker </strong>(voter, neutral) said the Fed should hold rates steady for a while; should watch how developments and data unfold before acting. On the economy, Harker said it is in good shape and expects economic growth of 2%; adding it is on track to achieve the 2% inflation target. Expects unemployment rate to stay below 4% for the next few years; mortgage refinancing could support consumer spending this year. More widely, the Philly Fed President said the negative effects of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy are something to watch, while uncertainty over fiscal policies, trade and geopolitical tensions are holding back business investment, he added. <strong>Fed’s Bowman</strong> (voter, neutral) reiterated that she sees a favourable US outlook of moderate growth, low unemployment and inflation rising to its target level.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB’s de Guindos stated the ECB has the tools and willingness to use them if necessary, noting interest rates can be lowered further, the volume of debt purchases can rise, as could liquidity injections. De Guindos, however, caveated the dovish comments stating the side effects are increasingly evident.</p><p><strong>* CHINA CPI (JAN.): </strong>Headline CPI rose 5.4% in January from December’s 4.5%, topping estimates for an increase of 4.9%. The rise in prices was largely driven by the effects of the Spring Festival, coupled with the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the National Bureau of Statistics – food prices rose 20.6% YY (Prev. 17.4%) while non-food prices rose 1.6%, up from the prior of 1.3%. Linking this to the coronavirus, Hubei Province - the epicentre of the nCoV epidemic, saw CPI rising 5.5% YY – which analysts note is relatively in-line with the country’s growth and thus reflects constructive measures taken the Chinese governments on securing supply and stabilising prices. Elsewhere PPI rose in-line with expectations at 0.1%, rising from negative 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 0.75 LOWER AT USD 49.57/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLED USD 1.20 LOWER AT USD 53.27/BBL: </strong>The crude complex was offered on Monday, extending Friday’s losses as participants ponder both the economic and sentiment impact from the coronavirus outbreak – seeing WTI/Brent arb. hit a multi-year low. Prices also struggled to find support on the OPEC front, Azerbaijan’s Energy Minister pushed back against holding an early OPEC+ meeting, while Russian Energy Minister Novak also noted that Russia is not yet prepared to reveal its stance regarding measures. Following the OPEC JTC meeting last week, the committee announced in a press release that it recommended extending voluntary production adjustments under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process until the end of 2020 and to proceed with an additional adjustment until the end of the second quarter; more specifically, separate sources report the proposed figure stood at an additional 600k BPD cut - Algeria’s Energy Minister said later that OPEC and Non-OPEC were still in discussions considering the JTC’s recommendation. Separately, according to Iraqi officials, the US has extended its waiver to Iraq to import Iranian energy, again, by for this time 120 days, with the officials noting Washington’s satisfaction with Iraq’s ongoing efforts to move to energy sufficiency. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, expectations (bbls) see crude +2.9mln, distillates -0.6mln, gasoline +0.7mln and Genscape sees Cushing stocks +2.3mln. Additionally, attention draws to the monthly reports from EIA, OPEC and IEA on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively, with particular focus on any changes to 2020 oil demand forecasts.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 131-11+:</strong> The TPLEX was bid on Monday as woes continued to linger on the coronavirus outbreak and its transmission globally. Desks note the \"wash out\" of speculative shorts ahead of a duration heavy US Treasury issuance schedule for the week (3s, 10s, and 30s), additionally, with the majority of S&amp;P 500 constituents now out of their earnings blackout, further IG corporate supply can be expected. The T-Note found its lows in the overnight before the Western front came and brought it back to highs as equity futures drifted lower somewhat before the cash open. However, the equity complex turned positive not long after the open, coinciding with strength in the greenback, keeping the 10-year yield anchored around 1.56% for a short while before it continued to move lower through till settlement, taking it just beneath 1.55%; curve spreads were little changed, with the belly seeing a slightly larger bid than the short and long end.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Foreign Minister Raab said a Singapore deal will be one of the first waves of free trade agreements (FTA) and wants a deal over the line ASAP, while Raab also stated the UK plans to start trade negotiations with Japan before spring and complete an FTA by year-end. In related news, the UK is reportedly planning to announce locations of as many as ten freeports this year. EU member states are reportedly toughening their demands for 'status quo' access to UK fishing waters post-Brexit, Telegraph reported. Norwegian PM Soldberg has warned Britain that Brexit should not be utilised as an opportunity to shut out other countries from fishing in British waters.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 +0.73% at 3352, Dow +0.60% at 29,277, NDX +1.23% at 9517. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Disc +1.26%, Cons Stpl +0.37%, Energy -0.81%, Financials +0.21%, Health +0.51%, Industrials +0.56%, Materials +0.01%, Real Estate +1.23%, Technology +1.35%, Communication Svs +0.83%, Utilities +0.34%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Loews (L) traded higher following a decent quarter. Allergan (AGN) also higher following top and bottom-line beats. Restaurant Brands (QSR) made gains after a revenue miss, but EPS came in above expectations and although Burger King and Tim Horton SSS missed expectations, it saw very strong Popeye SSS +34.4%, primarily driven by its chicken sandwich.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) initially opened 9% higher as its production restarted in China and, as a speculative M&amp;A Forbes piece suggested, it could be a target for Google at USD 1,500; however, gains were short-lived, and TSLA ended the session with gains of ~4%. AMD (AMD) was firmer on reports that suggested Apple (AAPL) could begin using AMD processors for Macs, replacing Intel (INTC), reported Street Insider. Amazon (AMZN) has tapped a Sony (SNE) executive, Mike Hopkins, to lead its Prime Video, Movie and TV Studios. General Motors (GM) was named as Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas’s best pick, noting its zero-emission plan has the potential to push the stock to USD 100. Biogen (BIIB) was lower following a poor Alzheimer’s trial with Eli-Lilly (LLY) which failed to meet its primary endpoint; neither did a study from Roche (ROGN SW). Apple (AAPL) opened lower following reports its cheaper iPhone may have to be postponed due to the coronavirus, but later rose with risk appetite. Apple key supplier Foxconn (2354 TT) came back to production today at one of its largest plants; however, source reports suggested only 10% of its workforce had returned. Initially, its Shenzhen plant had not opened, although source reports stated it has now received approval to resume partial production at the key plant. Slack (WORK) caught a bid on reports it had gained IBM (IBM) as a customer – its largest.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Simon Property Group (SPG) confirmed it is to acquire Taubman Centers (TCO), with an offer with a 50% premium to last Friday’s closing price, offering USD 52.50/shr<strong>. </strong>Xerox<strong> </strong>(XRX) increased<strong> </strong>its bid for HP Inc (HPQ) by USD 2 to USD 24/shr. L Brands (LB) is reportedly near a deal with Sycamore Partners for its Victoria Secret brand, where a deal could potentially be announced this week.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> continued its gain finding technical resistance at 98.885, a level it resides of heading into Asia trade. The gains follow on from strong US data last week, ahead of Powell’s semi-annual testimonies this week and the NH caucus tomorrow. MUFG highlight the relative attractiveness of the buck has been increased in the near term as concerns on growth outlook outside the US rise as Germany continues to see weak data, such as a -3.5% fall in industrial production, and despite the turnaround in business survey’s, it has not been backed by hard data. Meanwhile the coronavirus continues to dampen the outlook for growth. The desk also highlights an increased probability of President Trump winning a second term and further evidence of a resilient economy, as seen in last week’s NFP and ISM reports. Petro currencies <strong>CAD &amp; RUB </strong>trade flat against the buck after<strong> </strong>giving up initial strength as oil prices continued to sell. Elsewhere for the Loonie, Scotia believes “USDCAD is overshooting Fair Value by quite a margin and that the USD rally is showing signs of faltering”. <strong>CNH</strong> outpaced USD gains amid a firmer CPI which saw USDCNH fall back beneath the 7.00 figure. <strong>EURUSD </strong>fell amid broad dollar strength which saw a technical break through the 8th Oct. low at 1.0939 to find support just above the key 1.09 figure. If 1.09 were to give way, technicians are eyeing 1.0879, 8th Oct. low, as the next level of support. <strong>GBP</strong> firmer today despite further bearish Brexit headlines which suggest the EU is adding further additions to the EU’s mandate. <strong>JPY</strong> saw a relatively uneventful session all day and remains flat against the buck but above 109.50, UBS note it prefers to be long risk overall, suggesting a stop loss beneath 109-109.50, while noting topside resistance at 110. <strong>XAU </strong>traded firmer today and remains around the 1575 handle with UBS highlighting resistance above at 1582, and support at 1565. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally mixed. <strong>TRY</strong> was firmer following capital control intervention to stem TRY losses, which initially saw it cross beneath the 6.00 figure although lost most of its gains amid broad dollar strength and ongoing geopolitical concerns with Syria.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY CAPITAL CONTROLS</strong>: Turkey has further tightened control on the Lira in which regulators cut the limit for Turkish banks’ FX swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign entities to 10% of a bank’s equity, down from the prior of 25%.&nbsp; The moves announced by the banking regulator is aimed at limiting foreign speculators following last week’s weakness in the Turkish currency. The intervention by Turkey coincided with weekend military action which saw increased personnel and military equipment support sent to Syria’s Idlib region ahead of confrontation on Monday. The prospect of coordinated government and Central Bank action, as ever with Turkey, cannot be ruled out. Desks note that while the measure had some success in making it difficult for hedge funds short the TRY, it has also deterred investors from holding Turkish assets.</p>",

The gains follow on from strong US data last week, ahead of Powell’s semi-annual testimonies this week and the NH caucus tomorrow. MUFG highlight the relative attractiveness of the buck has been increased in the near term as concerns on growth outlook outside the US rise as Germany continues to see weak data, such as a -3.5% fall in industrial production, and despite the turnaround in business survey’s, it has not been backed by hard data. Meanwhile the coronavirus continues to dampen the outlook for growth. The desk also highlights an increased probability of President Trump winning a second term and further evidence of a resilient economy, as seen in last week’s NFP and ISM reports. Petro currencies <strong>CAD &amp; RUB </strong>trade flat against the buck after<strong> </strong>giving up initial strength as oil prices continued to sell. Elsewhere for the Loonie, Scotia believes “USDCAD is overshooting Fair Value by quite a margin and that the USD rally is showing signs of faltering”. <strong>CNH</strong> outpaced USD gains amid a firmer CPI which saw USDCNH fall back beneath the 7.00 figure. <strong>EURUSD </strong>fell amid broad dollar strength which saw a technical break through the 8th Oct. low at 1.0939 to find support just above the key 1.09 figure. If 1.09 were to give way, technicians are eyeing 1.0879, 8th Oct. low, as the next level of support. <strong>GBP</strong> firmer today despite further bearish Brexit headlines which suggest the EU is adding further additions to the EU’s mandate. <strong>JPY</strong> saw a relatively uneventful session all day and remains flat against the buck but above 109.50, UBS note it prefers to be long risk overall, suggesting a stop loss beneath 109-109.50, while noting topside resistance at 110. <strong>XAU </strong>traded firmer today and remains around the 1575 handle with UBS highlighting resistance above at 1582, and support at 1565. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally mixed. <strong>TRY</strong> was firmer following capital control intervention to stem TRY losses, which initially saw it cross beneath the 6.00 figure although lost most of its gains amid broad dollar strength and ongoing geopolitical concerns with Syria.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

Following the OPEC JTC meeting last week, the committee announced in a press release that it recommended extending voluntary production adjustments under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process until the end of 2020 and to proceed with an additional adjustment until the end of the second quarter; more specifically, separate sources report the proposed figure stood at an additional 600k BPD cut - Algeria’s Energy Minister said later that OPEC and Non-OPEC were still in discussions considering the JTC’s recommendation. Separately, according to Iraqi officials, the US has extended its waiver to Iraq to import Iranian energy, again, by for this time 120 days, with the officials noting Washington’s satisfaction with Iraq’s ongoing efforts to move to energy sufficiency. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, expectations (bbls) see crude +2.9mln, distillates -0.6mln, gasoline +0.7mln and Genscape sees Cushing stocks +2.3mln. Additionally, attention draws to the monthly reports from EIA, OPEC and IEA on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively, with particular focus on any changes to 2020 oil demand forecasts.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Continuing the recent pattern of trade, a brief interlude has prefaced more broad Greenback gains, albeit allied to weakness in certain rival currencies or in fact due to more pronounced weakness elsewhere. Regardless, the <strong>DXY</strong> has resumed its almost relentless advance and is inching even closer towards the next technical resistance level ahead of the 98.000 handle at 98.885 (vs 98.857 high so far) before attention returns to the Fed for speeches from Daly and Harker. However, Chairman Powell’s upcoming semi-annual testimonies could be pivotal in terms of the Buck’s fortunes and direction, barring any further external factors.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>All on the back foot, with the Euro unable to hold above near term chart support vs the US Dollar or withstand a strong rebound in the Pound for that matter. Indeed, Eur/Usd saw stops tripped when 1.0941 gave way and extended declines through 1.1000 to circa 1.0912, while Eur/Gbp reversed from just over 0.8500 to sub-0.8450 at one stage. Meanwhile, the Kiwi remains wary about a possible dovish RBNZ hold at the February policy meet, as Nzd/Usd slips back under 0.6400 and the Kiwi also loses ground vs its Antipodean peer even though the boost from Chinese inflation data overnight has dissipated. Similarly, the Loonie has not gleaned much traction from better than forecast Canadian housing data in the form of starts and building permits, as Usd/Cad trades much nearer the top of 1.3289-1.3329 parameters and another downturn in crude prices may be weighing on top of warnings from Finance Minister Monreau about the adverse impact of China’s coronavirus on the domestic economy.</p><p><strong>NOK/GBP/AUD/JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Loonie, much stronger than expected Norwegian CPI kept the Norwegian Crown elevated within a 10.1930-10.1090 range, while Sterling’s aforementioned revival was far less easy to fathom or put down to any positive catalyst given mainly bearish looking Brexit headlines and reports, like the EU and France hardening criteria for post-transition UK trade/relationship terms. Nonetheless, Cable reclaimed 1.2900+ status ahead of a raft of domestic data on Tuesday, unlike the Aussie that failed to sustain momentum forged from China’s CPI and PPI releases as noted above, as Aud/Usd lost grip of 0.6700. Elsewhere, the Yen and Franc held very tight lines vs the Greenback around 109.75 and 0.6775 respectively, with the former shrugging off BoJ critique from the IMF and latter taking mixed Swiss inflation in stride.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Eventful sessions for most regional currencies against the backdrop of renewed Dollar strength, but with the Try also bolstered by official intervention and buffeted by more investor jitters over Turkey’s military exchanges with Russian Syrian army forces. Meanwhile, the Huf had to contend with comments from the NBH about an impending liquidity squeeze without more downsizing of the Hungarian Central Bank’s swap portfolio.</p>",

Some desks note that this week will be crucial to see if the outbreak morphs into a pandemic (a global epidemic). Back to Europe, bourses are mixed with some mild impetus derived from headlines which reaffirmed China’s commitment to find a breakthrough in drugs for the pathogen (although price action was somewhat fleeting), whilst sectors also broadly mixed with no clear reflection of the overall sentiment. In terms of individual movers, NMC Health (+11.0%) leads the gains in the pan-European index after sources noted that the Co. is in talks with KKR regarding a potential deal, albeit KKR is having trouble fixing a price amid the recent volatility in NMC share prices – a ballpark figure of GBP 2bln is touted. Further, the source added that KKR might face competition from other US-based PE firms. Italian-listed Exor (+6.0%) remains a top gainer in the Stoxx 600 after source reports that Covea is reportedly in discussions regarding the acquisition of the Exor-controlled PartnerRe in an all-cash deal valued at USD 9bln - subsequently, Scor (-2.8%) shares trade lower as Covea hold some 8.5% of Scor.

Eur/Nok has recoiled sharply on the back of significantly stronger than expected Norwegian headline and core inflation that was boosted by higher food prices, transport costs and other services items, while Aud/Usd has rebounded on the coat-tails of the Yuan in wake of Chinese CPI beating consensus by some distance and PPI printing positive in y/y terms for the first time in 7 years. The Norwegian Krona is hovering around 10.1300 against the Euro within circa 10.1930-10.1090 parameters and the Aussie is trying to regain grip of the 0.6900 handle vs its US counterpart, as Usd/Cnh pulls back a bit further from recent 7.0000+ peaks despite the PBoC’s firmer Usd/Cny midpoint fix overnight.</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD -</strong> Sterling has recovered pretty well from another bout of selling pressure that pushed Cable back below 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp over 0.8500 again, but the rationale for the recovery appears as uncertain as the catalyst for the early EU session declines, suggesting technical factors and/or spec positioning looking for sustained Pound weakness that simply failed to materialise. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6400 against its US rival, but lagging in Aud/Nzd cross terms ahead of Wednesday’s RBNZ policy meeting even though the prospect of any change in the benchmark rate is deemed remote, and an element of caution could be warranted given a greater chance that guidance may be skewed towards further easing, if warranted and China’s coronavirus causes more widespread contagion.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/JPY/CHF -</strong> All narrowly mixed and rangebound vs the Greenback, as the DXY holds just shy of last Friday’s 97.722 post-NFP high and between 97.709-599, with Eur/Usd tightly bound around 1.0950 irrespective of more poor Eurozone data and political angst (only this time roles somewhat reversed as Italian IP plummeted and Germany’s CDU party leader opts not to run for Chancellor). Similarly, the Loonie is straddling 1.3300 ahead of Canada’s LEI and housing data, while the Yen is holding off recent lows and rebound highs amidst latest reports of a potential anti nCoV ‘breakthrough’ and Franc flitting either side of 0.6775/1.0700 against the Euro after mixed Swiss CPI reads vs expectations and weekly sight deposits.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Broad rebounds against the Dollar, but with the Lira only really stopping the rot with the aid of intervention and capital controls following Turkey’s BDDK lowering bank currency swap and FX forward limits to 10% from 25% previously.

Chart impulses aside, latest reports about ramped up efforts to contain the Chinese virus outbreak have sapped some demand for safe-havens as stocks pare some losses, as <strong>Bunds</strong> hover around 174.37 vs 174.51 at best, <strong>Gilts</strong> flatline after edging a minor new Liffe peak at 134.42 and 10 year T-notes crest 131-00. However, Italian BTPs continue to lag after dire ip data and Fitch affirmed the sovereign’s BBB standing with a stable outlook, as expected.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front-month futures remain choppy as focus remains on OPEC’s move following a three-day meeting by the group’s JTC. In terms of the fallout, the committee reportedly proposed a 600k supply cut to start immediately which will continue through to June if agreed by all members and they expect Russia to respond in a matter of days according to sources, while there were twitter reports of unconfirmed chatter OPEC+ are proposing extending current cuts into year-end. That said, Russian Energy Minister Novak continued to push back against these cuts stating that Russia needs a few days to analyse situation on oil market and will come up next week with its position for OPEC+ meeting due next month, although Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov that he supports the panel’s proposal of cutting oil output – but did not specify a preferred magnitude of reductions. WTI and Brent futures have largely traded on either side of USD 51/bbl and USD 55/bbl respectively before prices moved lower in tandem with sentiment. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> treads water just under USD 1570/oz with the yellow metal’s 21 DMA seen around 1564/oz. Meanwhile, copper prices saw brutal losses after hitting resistance at USD 2.6/lb (low USD 2.55/lb) with reports noting that Chinese copper traders, the metal’s largest market, asked miners to cancel or halt shipments of the red metal as the virus outbreak takes its toll on demand.</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that Russia is not yet prepared to announce its position on OPEC+ actions</strong>. In related news, Oman’s Oil Minister said he supports the output cut recommendations from the OPEC+ JTC, while there were separate comments from Azerbaijan’s Energy Minister who expects no early OPEC+ meeting and noted a February meeting was discussed and situation was analysed but the meeting will be held in March as planned.

In terms of the fallout, the committee reportedly proposed a 600k supply cut to start immediately which will continue through to June if agreed by all members and they expect Russia to respond in a matter of days according to sources, while there were twitter reports of unconfirmed chatter OPEC+ are proposing extending current cuts into year-end. That said, Russian Energy Minister Novak continued to push back against these cuts stating that Russia needs a few days to analyse situation on oil market and will come up next week with its position for OPEC+ meeting due next month, although Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov that he supports the panel’s proposal of cutting oil output – but did not specify a preferred magnitude of reductions. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures have largely traded on either side of USD 51/bbl and USD 55/bbl respectively before prices moved lower in tandem with sentiment. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> treads water just under USD 1570/oz with the yellow metal’s 21 DMA seen around 1564/oz. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices saw brutal losses after hitting resistance at USD 2.6/lb (low USD 2.55/lb) with reports noting that Chinese copper traders, the metal’s largest market, asked miners to cancel or halt shipments of the red metal as the virus outbreak takes its toll on demand.</p>",

Similarly, the Loonie is straddling 1.3300 ahead of Canada’s LEI and housing data, while the Yen is holding off recent lows and rebound highs amidst latest reports of a potential anti nCoV ‘breakthrough’ and Franc flitting either side of 0.6775/1.0700 against the Euro after mixed Swiss CPI reads vs expectations and weekly sight deposits.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Broad rebounds against the Dollar, but with the Lira only really stopping the rot with the aid of intervention and capital controls following Turkey’s BDDK lowering bank currency swap and FX forward limits to 10% from 25% previously. Usd/Try meandering from 6.0145 to 5.9775 or thereabouts.</p>",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were cautious due to the rising infected numbers and as some businesses resumed operations, although the mainland showed some early resilience amid continued PBoC efforts including the first round of special re-lending funds for tackling the coronavirus and CNY 900bln of reverse repo operations to sustain liquidity levels.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac markets begin the week with a sombre tone due to concerns regarding the ongoing coronavirus epidemic which surpassed the death toll from the SARS outbreak, and following last Friday’s losses on Wall St where markets pulled back from record highs but still notched the best weekly performance since June last year. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are subdued with underperformance seen in Australia’s tech and energy sectors although downside in the index is stemmed by resilience in gold miners and defensives, while the Tokyo benchmark has recouped most its opening losses on favourable currency flows. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are cautious due to the rising infected numbers and with some businesses resuming operations, although the mainland has shown some resilience amid continued PBoC efforts including the first round of special re-lending funds for tackling the coronavirus and CNY 900bln of reverse repo operations to sustain liquidity levels.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is rangebound near YTD highs after the recent firmer than expected US Non-Farm Payrolls and Average Earnings data. The greenback also found a floor due to the subdued trade in its transatlantic counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD around 1.0950 and 1.2900 respectively amid continued Brexit anxiety as EU member states are reportedly toughening their demands for 'status quo' access to UK fishing waters post-Brexit, while France is also demanding the UK aligns with EU rules permanently in return for a trade deal. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses nurse recent losses and antipodeans are slightly firmer heading into this week’s RBNZ meeting where OIS price in 92% chance for rates to be kept unchanged, while AUD/USD attempts a reclaim of the 0.6700 handle after firmer than expected Chinese inflation data and with PPI at its first increase in 7-months.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the cautious risk appetite in the region and with the BoJ present in the market in which it upped purchases in 10yr-25yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",
