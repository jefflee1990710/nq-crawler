        "content": "<p><strong>FOMC MINUTES</strong></p><p>FOMC minutes stated that policymakers noted patient approach for rate policy would likely be appropriate for some time even if global conditions keep improving although a few Fed members said policy may need to be tightened if the economy evolves as expected. Many members suggested the recent dip in inflation is likely to be transitory and a number of members said some risks to the economic outlook have moderated, while some also noted low inflation could un-anchor inflation expectations. Furthermore, many Fed members said holding shorter duration maturities on the Fed's balance sheet could help future maturity expansion programmes and others expressed concern that shorty maturity portfolio could keep the FFR lower over the long-term.

Qualcomm (QCOM) sunk as news emerged that a judge had ruled that the chipmaker had suppressed competition in the market for phone chips, whilst using its dominant position to charge “excessive” licensing fees. Apple (AAPL) also moved lower despite reports that the recent settlement between the two technology co.s is not in question, though Goldman Sachs did warn that one third of the iPhone maker’s profits were at stake should China ban sales. Analog Devices (ADI) moved higher after the chipmaker reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines, shrugging off a cut to forward guidance. Target (TGT) jumped higher at the open after the department store co. reported strong earnings, as well as same store sales growth which topped expectations. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) sunk as the home improvement retailer reported disappointing earnings, that missed on bottom line expectations. Home Depot (HD) was also dragged lower, but holds on to the lion’s share of yesterday’s post earnings gains. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) popped higher at the open after the firm reported earnings that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines before backing its FY19 guidance. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) opened lower after MGM Resorts (MGM) pulled the plug on a proposed deal to by the former’s casino in the Boston-area. Tesla (TSLA) took another beating, as concerns over future demand intensified.

The usual concoction of trade sentiment, Brexit jitters, and Fedspeak were cited (on the latter, there were upticks on remarks from Fed's Bullard, who after overnight saying he did not see the need to cut rates, added that if inflation weakens, he would not rule out a rate cut this year). There was very little reaction to the FOMC meeting minutes, where the message was that the Fed does not plan to raise rates even if the economy evolves in line with their projections, though a few wanted to see tightening in this scenario; there was no discussion of rate cuts, it appears. The implied probability of a rate cut in 2019 fell from around 68% to 66% in wake of the release, according to the CME's Fedwatch. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed. US T-note futures (M9) settled 9+ ticks higher at 124-14.</p>",

Policymakers generally agreed a patient approach to interest rate policy changes was warranted. A few said policies may need to be tightened if the economy evolves as expected. On inflation, many said the recent dip in inflation was likely to be transitory, and some said low inflation could un-anchor inflation expectations. A number of members said some risks to the economic outlook have moderated, including for the global outlook, Brexit and trade talks. There was heavy discussion of the balance sheet: Many Fed members said holding shorter duration maturities on the Fed's balance sheet could help future maturity expansion programmes; others expressed concern that shorty maturity portfolio could keep the FFR lower over the long-term. Members discussed options for reaching long-term portfolio composition, considered accelerated vs. gradual approaches. A number of members said a portfolio with more capacity for a maturity expansion programme was more desirable than a \"proportional portfolio\" with maturities similar to those of outstanding Treasuries.</p><p><strong>* FEDSPEAK: </strong>Fed's Williams (voter) said the US economy is still in a good place and risks to global growth have receded and expects US growth above 2% this year, inflationary pressures are essentially non-existent, no arguments to move rates at this point. Overnight, Bullard (voter, dove) said that the Fed may have \"slightly overdone it\" by lifting the FFR target in December - the first on the FOMC to have suggested that December's rate hike may have been a mistake. However, Bullard - who has called himself the most dovish FOMC member in the past - added that it is too early to discuss rate cuts. On the trade front, Fed's Rosengren (voter) assumes US and China will reach a trade accord, if trade war forecast is wrong then the Fed need to think of policy.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The US is mulling blacklisting up to five Chinese surveillance firms, sources said; firms include Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, and the US is still considering whether to add Hikvision, Zhejiang Dahua Technology, and others to the blacklist, which bars them from US tech components and software. The Chinese ambassador to the US said that the door to the US was still open for talks, a message later repeated by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, who also noted that he had not yet arranged a visit to Beijing. China’s Global Times Editor delivered punchier rhetoric; confirming that Xi had been discussing the possibility of using rare earth mineral exports to the US as a trade weapon, although caveating that the government would not do this immediately, but rather it is evaluating the need to do so. It is worth noting that analysts have rubbished the prospect of China opting to use its rare earth mineral exports as a trade weapon due to the self-harm it would cause, click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-would-china-weaponise-rare-earths-rabobank-thinks-not-21-05-2019\">here</a> for more in depth analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May faced calls from within the Conservative Party to resign \"immediately\" on Tuesday evening, after she unveiled her new compromise Brexit Bill, which has been described as a \"sellout\" attempt to save her Brexit deal, the Telegraph reported. Given that May's new deal has failed to secure support of Brexiteers, coalition partner DUP, or even the opposition Labour Party, it appears dead on arrival, and cabinet members and conservative MPs urged the PM to pull the vote. Wednesday saw the PM again try to defend her deal, but her efforts seemed futile; calls for her to outline her departure grew louder. Amid a flurry of private meetings between the PM and her cabinet members, there was even speculation of a resignation as early as today, though government sources dashed these suggestions. The 1922 committee added to the pressure; reports suggested that it has enough votes to change the no confidence rules but have not as of yet, though refrained from changing rules; the Committee will meet with PM May on Friday. Later in the session, Leader of the House Leadsom announced her resignation, saying she could no longer support the government’s approach; Leadsom is expected to run for the Tory leader job.</p><p><strong>* US TREASURY SECRETARY MNUCHIN: </strong>Mnuchin, attending a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, commented that he currently has no plans to visit Beijing, but still expects US President Trump and China President Xi to meet at the G20 summit in June. He also noted that if China wants to return to the table and \"move forward on the basis we were, we're open for conversations\" and it is likely that will not proceed with proposed tariff increases for 30-40 days. Mnuchin also vowed be very careful to protect industries and consumers with tariff exclusions and said he expects businesses to move away from China as a result of tariffs.</p><p><strong>* CANADA RETAIL SALES</strong>: Canadian Retail Sales MM (Mar) 1.1% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. 0.8%, Rev. 1.0%); core 1.7% vs. Exp. 0.9% (Prev. 0.6%, Rev. 0.7%). Retail sales growth in line with evidence of a rebound in Canadian activity, noted Scotiabank. But the bank says expanding retail sales, which point to improving consumer spending, do not change our expectation of 0.4% M/M growth in real industry-level GDP. Consistent with this monthly GDP growth profile, the Q1-2019 nowcast remains relatively unchanged at 1.27% Q/Q SAAR, the bank said.</p><p><strong>* SARB PREVIEW:</strong> SARB expected to keep rates unchanged at 6.75%; decision due on Thursday at 1400 BST/1100 EDT. Ahead of Thursday's SARB meeting, South Africa CPI eased to 4.4% Y/Y on the back of weaker core prices, and some analysts see further downside through the rest of the year. Capital Economics suggests that activity data augurs poorly, and sees a Q1 contraction, and has a non-consensus view that the SARB will cut rates later in the year (from 6.75% to 6.50% in Q4, it thinks); most analysts see rates remaining on hold through 2019. More specifically for the SARB meeting, TD Securities notes that the market is positioned for a hold, but is gradually pricing in a rising chance of a rate cut later on this year. \"A full cut seems to be priced by January/March 2020,\" the bank says, \"we think the SARB's rhetoric will continue to be skewed to the hawkish side of market expectations, though benign inflation is likely to help the MPC soften its stance further compared to the prior March meeting.\" The bank adds that beyond this meeting, it is expecting the SARB to remain on hold until mid-2020, when it forecasts a single 25bps rate hike for the year. On the ZAR reaction, TD says the rand is likely to remain neutral, but political developments will have a stronger sway on USDZAR more than the MPC's decision. We still like the pair closer to 14.00 than 14.40. Further ahead, traders are awaiting details on appointments to the full government cabinet after the recent elections, expected to be announced next week.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9, EXPIRES) SETTLES 1.71 LOWER AT 61.42/BBL; BRENT (N9) SETTLES 1.19 LOWER AT 71.99/BBL.</strong> Crude prices nosedived out of their recent trading range on Wednesday, where rising US energy inventories and more muted supply concerns gave bears a catalyst. The DoE data release showed US crude stocks surprise building 4.74mln barrels (exp. -0.59mln), painting an even more bearish scenario than the API's 2.4mln build; gasoline and distillates both printed surprise builds of 3.7mln and 0.8mln respectively, both were more bearish than the API reported +0.35mln and -0.24mln respectively; Cushing stocks built by 1.3mln. On top of the inventories, the DoE reported US crude production rising +0.8% to 12.2mln BPD. Also acting as headwind for the market was reports out of Russia that clean crude oil had begun flowing through the Druzhba pipeline, with oil moving through Ukraine to the borders of Hungary and Slovakia.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2856, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% at 7421, Dow Jones -0.4% at 25776, SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary -0.9%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy -1.6%, Financials -0.5%, Health Care 0.6%, Industrials -0.8%, Information Technology -0.6%, Materials -0.7%, Telecommunication Services 0%, Utilities 0.8%</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECFICS: B</strong>oeing (BA) was under pressure after news emerged over night that Chinese airlines, the first to implement the grounding of the 737 Max, will press the aircraft maker for compensation. Qualcomm (QCOM) sunk as news emerged that a judge had ruled that the chipmaker had suppressed competition in the market for phone chips, whilst using its dominant position to charge “excessive” licensing fees. Apple (AAPL) also moved lower despite reports that the recent settlement between the two technology co.s is not in question, though Goldman Sachs did warn that one third of the iPhone maker’s profits were at stake should China ban sales. Analog Devices (ADI) moved higher after the chipmaker reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines, shrugging off a cut to forward guidance. Target (TGT) jumped higher at the open after the department store co. reported strong earnings, as well as same store sales growth which topped expectations. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) sunk as the home improvement retailer reported disappointing earnings, that missed on bottom line expectations. Home Depot (HD) was also dragged lower, but holds on to the lion’s share of yesterday’s post earnings gains. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) popped higher <strong>at the open after the firm reported earnings that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines before backing its FY19 guidance. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) opened lower after MGM Resorts (MGM) pulled the plug on a proposed deal to by the former’s casino in the Boston-area. Tesla (TSLA) took another beating, as concerns over future demand intensified.</strong></p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 9+ TICKS HIGHER AT 124-14.</strong> Treasury yields fell by between 2-4bps on Wednesday, though the range was narrow. The usual concoction of trade sentiment, Brexit jitters, and Fedspeak were cited (on the latter, there were upticks on remarks from Fed's Bullard, who after overnight saying he did not see the need to cut rates, added that if inflation weakens, he would not rule out a ate cut this year). There was very little reaction to the FOMC meeting minutes, where the message was that the Fed does not plan to raise rates even if the economy evolves in line with their projections, though a few wanted to see tightening in this scenario; there was no discussion of rate cuts, it appears. The implied probability of a rate cut in 2019 fell from around 68% to 66% in wake of the release, according to the CME's Fedwatch. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed.</p><p><strong>* DAILY FX WRAP: USD </strong>was unmoved by the FOMC Minutes, which delivered little in the way of surprises; DXY continues to meander just above 98.00. <strong>EUR</strong> was fairly flat amid caution ahead of tomorrows Eurozone PMI data and the European Elections, as well as ECB mins. <strong>JPY </strong>was on the front foot as trade/machinery orders data surprised to the upside and risk sentiment took a knock; with the US further extending its Chinese company blacklist to more Chinese firms and Brexit concerns again dominating European headlines. <strong>GBP </strong>fell further as opposition to UK PM May’s new Brexit offer, and calls for her to resign, mounted. <strong>CAD </strong>caught a bid after retail sales came in above expectations. <strong>TRY</strong> had a rough day amidst reports that Russia and Turkey are ready to fulfil S-400 order commitments irrespective of US protestations. <strong>ZAR</strong> was firm ahead of tomorrow’s SARB meeting (expected unchanged). <strong>MXN </strong>saw slightly higher, with the Foreign Minister upbeat about the prospects for the USMCA and future auto talks Germany.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Some have found this week's EUR weakness slightly at odds with Bund yields ticking up. SocGen notes that one explanation could be central bank activity in Asia (where the bulk of FX reserves are held, and USD buying has been stepped-up of late in order to stabilise local FX). \"This assumes selling non-USD portions of FX reserves which includes EUR as well as GBP,\" SocGen says, \"the leg lower in KRW for example suggests more reserve-related flows could still drag the single currency to levels below 1.1150 and GBP below 1.2700.\" (The bank is watching KRW key level at 1,200, with reports that South Korean officials will meet soon regarding the 'distortion in KRW trading'; and key level 14,500 for the IDR, which was breached overnight), and SocGen says that the scale of the retreat in the GBP also appears too large to credit the instability of PM May's government.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Construction work data for Q1, which feeds into GDP, disappointed overnight. Additionally, DEWR skilled vacancies was 1.9% lower in April, the third month of declines (down around 8% over three-months - largest since 2012); given that the RBA's main guide is the unemployment rate, the data is likely to support the growing case for the central bank to cut rates, given that it is consistent with the jobless rate ticking up. JPM thinks that AUD will have a tough time rallying ahead of the RBA's 6 June meeting, particularly as there are no major data releases scheduled in that window. \"Trust the best G10 trend and stay short, eyeing a break of last week’s 0.6865 low to help extend losses further, with 0.6827 the next level below,\" JPM says, and \"add on rallies ahead of 0.6940 if we see them.\"</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> The PBOC on its Weibo account announced overnight that it would again issue Bills in Hong Kong, though it has not provided any details on its website, which UBS says is a warning that it could drain offshore liquidity anytime soon, and make it more expensive for yuan bears to short sell the currency. The PBOC last week also sold Bills in HK, which the market interpreted as a sign that it was signalling tougher control of the yuan by selling bills in Hong Kong, not onshore, which could tighten liquidity and buoy the yuan rate.</p><p><strong>* RUB:</strong> ING notes that Russia is taking advantage of the favourable sentiment, and it is front-loading OFZ issuance. Russia today offered unlimited amounts of 2024 and 2030 OFZs; ING Argues that while foreign appetite has been good, and while the foreign flows are supporting the RUB, it says that a less favourable balance of payments environment over the months ahead could see USDRUB push-up to the 66 handle.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> Is generally holding up well vs buck strength, underpinned by the recent solid employment data, US lifting steel and aluminium tariffs, Trump's wish to get USMCA ratified before summer (and then talking about infrastructure spending), as well as BOC Governor Poloz recent upbeat views on the Canadian economy. BOC next week.</p><p><strong>* NOK:</strong> Remains a function of overall risk sentiment as well as oil price moves. The jobs report and Norges Bank expectations survey could influence price action could influence action on Thursday.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* DAILY FX WRAP: USD </strong>was unmoved by the FOMC Minutes, which delivered little in the way of surprises; DXY continues to meander just above 98.00. <strong>EUR</strong> was fairly flat amid caution ahead of tomorrows Eurozone PMI data and the European Elections, as well as ECB mins. <strong>JPY </strong>was on the front foot as trade/machinery orders data surprised to the upside and risk sentiment took a knock; with the US further extending its Chinese company blacklist to more Chinese firms and Brexit concerns again dominating European headlines. <strong>GBP </strong>fell further as opposition to UK PM May’s new Brexit offer, and calls for her to resign, mounted. <strong>CAD </strong>caught a bid after retail sales came in above expectations. <strong>TRY</strong> had a rough day amidst reports that Russia and Turkey are ready to fulfil S-400 order commitments irrespective of US protestations. <strong>ZAR</strong> was firm ahead of tomorrow’s SARB meeting (expected unchanged). <strong>MXN </strong>saw slightly higher, with the Foreign Minister upbeat about the prospects for the USMCA and future auto talks Germany.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Some have found this week's EUR weakness slightly at odds with Bund yields ticking up. SocGen notes that one explanation could be central bank activity in Asia (where the bulk of FX reserves are held, and USD buying has been stepped-up of late in order to stabilise local FX). \"This assumes selling non-USD portions of FX reserves which includes EUR as well as GBP,\" SocGen says, \"the leg lower in KRW for example suggests more reserve-related flows could still drag the single currency to levels below 1.1150 and GBP below 1.2700.\" (The bank is watching KRW key level at 1,200, with reports that South Korean officials will meet soon regarding the 'distortion in KRW trading'; and key level 14,500 for the IDR, which was breached overnight), and SocGen says that the scale of the retreat in the GBP also appears too large to credit the instability of PM May's government.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Construction work data for Q1, which feeds into GDP, disappointed overnight. Additionally, DEWR skilled vacancies was 1.9% lower in April, the third month of declines (down around 8% over three-months - largest since 2012); given that the RBA's main guide is the unemployment rate, the data is likely to support the growing case for the central bank to cut rates, given that it is consistent with the jobless rate ticking up. JPM thinks that AUD will have a tough time rallying ahead of the RBA's 6 June meeting, particularly as there are no major data releases scheduled in that window. \"Trust the best G10 trend and stay short, eyeing a break of last week’s 0.6865 low to help extend losses further, with 0.6827 the next level below,\" JPM says, and \"add on rallies ahead of 0.6940 if we see them.\"</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> The PBOC on its Weibo account announced overnight that it would again issue Bills in Hong Kong, though it has not provided any details on its website, which UBS says is a warning that it could drain offshore liquidity anytime soon, and make it more expensive for yuan bears to short sell the currency. The PBOC last week also sold Bills in HK, which the market interpreted as a sign that it was signalling tougher control of the yuan by selling bills in Hong Kong, not onshore, which could tighten liquidity and buoy the yuan rate.</p><p><strong>* RUB:</strong> ING notes that Russia is taking advantage of the favourable sentiment, and it is front-loading OFZ issuance. Russia today offered unlimited amounts of 2024 and 2030 OFZs; ING Argues that while foreign appetite has been good, and while the foreign flows are supporting the RUB, it says that a less favourable balance of payments environment over the months ahead could see USDRUB push-up to the 66 handle.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> Is generally holding up well vs buck strength, underpinned by the recent solid employment data, US lifting steel and aluminium tariffs, Trump's wish to get USMCA ratified before summer (and then talking about infrastructure spending), as well as BOC Governor Poloz recent upbeat views on the Canadian economy. BOC next week.</p><p><strong>* NOK:</strong> Remains a function of overall risk sentiment as well as oil price moves. The jobs report and Norges Bank expectations survey could influence price action could influence action on Thursday.</p>",

The usual concoction of trade sentiment, Brexit jitters, and Fedspeak were cited (on the latter, there were upticks on remarks from Fed's Bullard, who after overnight saying he did not see the need to cut rates, added that if inflation weakens, he would not rule out a ate cut this year). There was very little reaction to the FOMC meeting minutes, where the message was that the Fed does not plan to raise rates even if the economy evolves in line with their projections, though a few wanted to see tightening in this scenario; there was no discussion of rate cuts, it appears. The implied probability of a rate cut in 2019 fell from around 68% to 66% in wake of the release, according to the CME's Fedwatch. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>With just a couple of real/notable exceptions, the Dollar has been erring towards caution vs G10 and EM rivals ahead of the FOMC minutes as the <strong>DXY</strong> slipped a bit further below 98.000 within a 98.128-97.885 range and only really kept sight of the big figure at the expense of others. However, the aforementioned Fed release is not expected to reveal anything really new on the policy front or in terms of guidance as most believe the account of the last policy meeting will merely reaffirm patience and a pause rather than moving any closer to the prospect of an ease before the end of this year – see the Ransquawk Research Suite for a more detailed preview.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has been on the back foot for the most part and extending its broad reversal from yesterday’s peaks posted on the initial reaction to UK PM May’s ‘bold’ Brexit plan that was intended to win over more HoC support, but has only sparked more outrage and opposition to the extent that her position is looking increasingly fragile. Indeed, ahead of a 1922 gathering at 16.00BST speculation is mounting that coup including Cabinet members will call for a confidence vote that could force her out and avoid the possibility (probability) of an even heavier MV4 defeat. Cable is now below 1.2638 Fib support, eyeing yet another round number to the downside, then 1.2593 (also a Fib retracement) and 1.2582 (January 2nd low) before the so called ‘flash crash’ base at 1.2439 (just a day later), while Eur/Gbp is eyeing 0.8840 (Valentine’s Day high) ahead of 0.8865 (Fib resistance).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another tough session for the EM’s Sterling proxy, Lira, as Turkey and Russia firmed up talk about fast-tracking the S-400 order and latest reserves data showed another reduction in ammunition for the fight against capital flight. Usd/Try peered above resistance around 6.1000 and remains close to the level after a relatively shallow reversal in contrast to other regional currencies that are clawing back lost ground against the Greenback, like the Real after positive vibes on Brazil’s pension reform bill and the Rand ahead of tomorrow’s SARB policy meeting.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The latest downturn in broad risk sentiment has rekindled demand for the safe-haven Franc and Yen, as the former staged a more pronounced rebound from 1.0100+ territory vs the Buck and the latter continued to bounce from 110.50+ lows towards 110.25, but not quite close enough to arouse decent option expiry interest between 110.20-25 (1.2 bn).</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Loonie derived some support from firmer than forecast Canadian retail sales data, but faded ahead of offers said to be waiting at 1.3350 and retested pre-release lows under 1.3400 as oil prices recoiled in wake of another unexpected build in US crude inventories that exacerbated an earlier tech-led slide. However, the Aussie and Kiwi underperformed and revisited recent multi-month/ytd troughs around 0.6862 and sub-0.6500 respectively, with the former awaiting May PMIs to see if the services and composite headlines hold above the key 50.0 threshold or whether contractions add to the case for near term RBA stimulus.</p>",

The API reported crude stocks building 2.4mln bbls, where expectations were at a draw of 0.6mln; gasoline stocks built 0.35mln bbls (exp. -0.8mln), and distillates drew 0.24mln bbls (exp. -0.05); Cushing was seen building a sizeable 0.87mln bbls too. Attention now lies ahead for Wednesday’s official DoE inventory data release due at 10:30 ET/15:30 BST.</li><li>Comments from Russia are easing supply concerns on Wednesday, who say that clean oil is now moving through the Druzhba pipeline towards the border of Hungary and Slovakia, and that it is in conversation with Poland to continue flows. Yesterday it was reported that Total’s (FP FP) Leuna refinery in Germany cannot yet receive the contaminated oil (estimated at 8mln-9mln bbls worth) that it agreed to take due to equipment malfunctions; it is unclear where this contaminated oil currently is along the pipeline, but it appears Russia has worked a somewhat work around with this latest news.</li><li>Morgan Stanley sees Brent prices remaining in the USD 70-80 per barrel range for the remainder of the year before “normalising” to its longer-term anchor in 2020 at USD 65/bbl, noting the “Large-but-opposing forces” keeping the benchmark rangebound in recent weeks. The analysts highlight the falling global oil demand, particularly in OECD, reported in the recent IEA report, on top of bearish demand data out of China and India, “Incoming macro data has rapidly turned bearish, and this is visible in oil demand data too.” With a US-China trade deal looking increasingly less likely, the chance of a realisation of a fall in global demand rises.</li></ul>",

European equities are now mostly higher as equities gained traction ahead of US’ market entrance. UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.5%) outperforms its peers as exporters are bolstered by the Brexit-dented Pound. Sectors are posting broad-based gains, whilst energy stocks bear the brunt of the falling prices in the complex. In terms of individual movers, Royal Mail (+6.2%) spiked higher on the back of optimistic earnings coupled with a dividend cut to fund a turnaround, whilst Spanish listed DIA (+5.4%) continues to benefit from Santander’s care package, which was announced yesterday. Meanwhile, Babcock (-8.4%) shares plummeted after the Co. noted that the upcoming FY earnings are to be impacted by a number of significant factors. Looking at analysis from Nomura Quant, the report notes that CTAs have dissolved long positions in a majority of regions and are now roughly neutral in the FTSE 100, Nikkei 225, Hang Seng and TAIEX, with bearish positions limited to the KOSPI and TOPIX, albeit bullish stances are ongoing for the DAX and NIFTY 50. Apart for the DAX, CTAs have a low equity exposure, “so the risk of a drop in share prices from systematic cutting of existing long positions looks limited” says Nomura.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) – Federal Judge has ruled that the Co’s practices violated antitrust laws, with the judge siding with the FTC.

The marked turnaround in sentiment comes amidst widespread uproar over the latest WA proposal and even more rebellion against the PM, especially from the 1922 faction that is set to meet at 4 pm and could launch a confidence vote as soon as today. Back to the pilloried Pound, 1.2650 could offer symbolic support vs the Dollar ahead of a Fib at 1.2638, if option expiry interest between 1.2665-70 in 500 mn fails to stem the tide, while 0.8840 may cap losses against the single currency. Note, UK inflation data has been largely ignored, but for the record CPI was slightly softer than forecast and PPI input prices well below consensus.</p><p><strong>DXY - </strong>The index remains toppy above 98.000 after several attempts and failures to clear chart hurdles ahead of the 2019 highs, with the Greenback sitting tight and rangebound vs G10 counterparts in advance of the FOMC minutes, bar Sterling as noted above.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD - </strong>The non-US Dollars have clawed back some of their recent losses with the Aussie back within touching distance of 0.6900, Kiwi pivoting 0.6500 and Loonie straddling 1.3400. All eyes on the aforementioned account of the Fed’s recent policy meet, but Canadian retail sales data could provide the Cad with some independent impetus beforehand.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY - </strong>All treading water vs the Usd as the Franc hovers just above 1.0100 and Euro trades mostly above 1.1150 following yesterday’s brief probe below, but the topside capped ahead of decent expiries at 1.1180 (1.5 bn). Meanwhile, the Yen is meandering between 110.37-62 after reported offers from Japanese corporates and asset managers, and with Fib resistance noted at 110.71 also keeping the headline pair contained.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Rand is on the rebound regardless of softer than anticipated SA inflation data, with Usd/Zar near the bottom end of a 14.4400-3500 range ahead of Thursday’s SARB policy meeting amidst perceptions that the tone will remain hawkish even though there are grounds for a reassessment of projections signalling a hike by the end of 2019. Conversely, the Lira is still struggling and testing support at 6.1000 vs the Buck amidst reports that Russia and Turkey are ready to fulfil S-400 order commitments irrespective of US protestations.</p><p>Australian Construction Work Done (Q1) -1.9% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. -3.1%).

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>A relatively firm bounce across EU cash bourses amidst conflicting US-China and Brexit-related reports may have quelled demand for core debt, but the German bond will have taken on board a somewhat lukewarm reception to the latest 10 year offering as well. Indeed, Bunds are back below or around parity vs +23 ticks at best and Gilts have pared gains to sub-1/2 point from +63 ticks having faded just above 129.00 on a lack of follow-through buying and further bullish momentum, with perhaps some acknowledgment of comments from the 1922 Vice chair suggesting less haste in terms of trying to oust UK PM May than earlier indications implied. Meanwhile, US Treasuries appear rather detached and sticking within narrow overnight session trading parameters pre-FOMC minutes and more Fed speakers in the run up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>WTI and Brent futures are on the backfoot after the API reported a surprise build in US crude inventories (+2.4mln vs. Exp. -0.6mln), marking a 5th consecutive week of builds reported by the institute. Brent futures current reside below the USD 71.50/bbl level whilst WTI futures fluctuates on either side of USD 62.50 with PVM highlighting “critical” support levels at 62.54 and 62.31 which, if breached, could cause a decline in prices towards the 61.63/22 area, according to the analysts. Participants will be looking ahead to the more widely looked at EIA crude inventory report with headline crude stocks expected to decline by just over 2.5mln barrel. Elsewhere, precious metals are relatively tentative and awaiting any US/China update ahead of the FOMC Minutes release later today (preview available in the Research Suite). Meanwhile, copper prices are sliding as the Buck gains more ground against a backdrop of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Despite this, mining giant Antofagasta expects the copper market to tighten this year and note a positive outlook for the red metal in 2019 and beyond. Spot copper declined through USD 2.7/lb to touch levels last seen in late January.</p><p>OPEC exports are declining to their lowest levels in 4 years in May amid lower Iranian and Venezuelan shipments.

        "content": "<p>A relatively firm bounce across EU cash bourses amidst conflicting US-China and Brexit-related reports may have quelled demand for core debt, but the German bond will have taken on board a somewhat lukewarm reception to the latest 10 year offering as well. Indeed, Bunds are back below or around parity vs +23 ticks at best and Gilts have pared gains to sub-1/2 point from +63 ticks having faded just above 129.00 on a lack of follow-through buying and further bullish momentum, with perhaps some acknowledgment of comments from the 1922 Vice chair suggesting less haste in terms of trying to oust UK PM May than earlier indications implied. Meanwhile, US Treasuries appear rather detached and sticking within narrow overnight session trading parameters pre-FOMC minutes and more Fed speakers in the run up.</p>",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: Pound precarious as pressure piles on PM May",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling’s slump continues, with Cable breaching another technically significant level at 1.2670 after a 360°-plus turnaround from 1.2800+ knee-jerk highs on Tuesday when UK PM May unveiled her new Brexit blueprint with the carrots of a 2nd referendum and temporary EU customs union, while Eur/Gbp has now surpassed strong chart resistance ahead of 0.8800 in the form of the 200 DMA (0.8793) on the way to a 0.8815 high and the cross is on course to extend a run of consecutive rallies to 13 sessions. The marked turnaround in sentiment comes amidst widespread uproar over the latest WA proposal and even more rebellion against the PM, especially from the 1922 faction that is set to meet at 4 pm and could launch a confidence vote as soon as today. Back to the pilloried Pound, 1.2650 could offer symbolic support vs the Dollar ahead of a Fib at 1.2638, if option expiry interest between 1.2665-70 in 500 mn fails to stem the tide, while 0.8840 may cap losses against the single currency. Note, UK inflation data has been largely ignored, but for the record CPI was slightly softer than forecast and PPI input prices well below consensus.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index remains toppy above 98.000 after several attempts and failures to clear chart hurdles ahead of the 2019 highs, with the Greenback sitting tight and rangebound vs G10 counterparts in advance of the FOMC minutes, bar Sterling as noted above.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD</strong></p><p>The non-US Dollars have clawed back some of their recent losses with the Aussie back within touching distance of 0.6900, Kiwi pivoting 0.6500 and Loonie straddling 1.3400. All eyes on the aforementioned account of the Fed’s recent policy meet, but Canadian retail sales data could provide the Cad with some independent impetus beforehand.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>All treading water vs the Usd as the Franc hovers just above 1.0100 and Euro trades mostly above 1.1150 following yesterday’s brief probe below, but the topside capped ahead of decent expiries at 1.1180 (1.5 bn). Meanwhile, the Yen is meandering between 110.37-62 after reported offers from Japanese corporates and asset managers, and with Fib resistance noted at 110.71 also keeping the headline pair contained.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Rand is on the rebound regardless of softer than anticipated SA inflation data, with Usd/Zar near the bottom end of a 14.4400-3500 range ahead of Thursday’s SARB policy meeting amidst perceptions that the tone will remain hawkish even though there are grounds for a reassessment of projections signalling a hike by the end of 2019. Conversely, the Lira is still struggling and testing support at 6.1000 vs the Buck amidst reports that Russia and Turkey are ready to fulfil S-400 order commitments irrespective of US protestations.</p>",

Note, resistance for the 10 year bond if the current high is surpassed comes just before 129.00 at Monday’s 128.96 session high.</p>",

Broad risk sentiment continues to stabilise after the recent bout of aversion on US-China trade issues, while Bunds are also conceding ground to Eurozone peripheral bonds that have staged a firm recovery ahead of month end and an especially supportive index extension for Bonos amidst the overall longer than average duration per Citi’s EGBI. However, the core debt future has just inched up to a marginal new high of 166.67 (+18 ticks vs -5 ticks at worst), as UK Gilts return to Liffe on the bounce.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were indecisive as the momentum from Wall St, where all majors gained as Huawei's reprieve inspired the trade sensitive sectors, somewhat dissipated as markets await the next developments in the US-China trade saga and upcoming FOMC minutes. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were mixed for most the session with Australia subdued by weakness in mining related stocks as well as financials, while the Japanese benchmark was kept afloat by recent currency weakness and after varied data releases including better than expected Machine Orders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) diverged with the mainland cautious amid ongoing trade uncertainty and with Hangzhou Hikvision heavily pressured after reports that the Trump administration is considering restrictions on the Co. This has also weighed on other tech names, although losses in the broader market were stemmed after a liquidity injection by the PBoC and with the central bank seeking to further reduce borrowing costs for small businesses. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially softened amid gains in Japanese stocks and with participants sidelined ahead of a 20yr auction later, although prices then recovered on strong auction results in which the b/c rose to its highest on record.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are indecisive as the momentum from Wall St, where all majors gained as Huawei's reprieve inspired the trade sensitive sectors, has somewhat dissipated as markets await the next developments in the US-China trade saga and upcoming FOMC minutes. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are mixed with Australia dragged lower by losses in mining related stocks as well as financials, while the Japanese benchmark has been kept afloat by recent currency weakness and after varied data releases including better than expected Machine Orders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) have also diverged with the mainland cautious amid ongoing trade uncertainty and with Hangzhou Hikvision heavily pressured after reports that the Trump administration is considering restrictions on the Co. This has also weighed on other tech names, although losses are stemmed after a liquidity injection by the PBoC and as the central bank seeks to further reduce borrowing costs for small businesses.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre but remains around the 98.00 level with price action rangebound heading into the FOMC minutes, while its major counterparts are also uneventful with EUR/USD flatlining and as GBP/USD composes itself following yesterday’s volatility. As a reminder, GBP/USD initially surged above 1.2800 as PM May gave details of her new Brexit offer which includes a requirement to vote on whether to hold a 2nd referendum and proposal for a temporary customs union with the EU. However, the gains were short lived and the pair was quickly brought back down as her offer sparked backlash from the Eurosceptics with many including the ERG to vote against the bill and with the Labour party also unimpressed as it didn’t contain any fundamental changes and as the proposed customs union was only temporary. Elsewhere, antipodeans are subdued after the recent hints from the RBA of a potential rate cut next month and after Construction Work data unexpectedly contracted which is one of the inputs for GDP, while USD/JPY holds on to recent gains around 110.50 as the positive risk tone in Tokyo and continued contraction in Exports weighs on the JPY.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are softer amid gains in Japanese stocks and with participants sidelined ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>",
