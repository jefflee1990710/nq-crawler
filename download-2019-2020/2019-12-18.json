Williams expects to see growth around 2.25%, unemployment around 3.5% and inflation remaining soft, stating that he hasn’t seen inflationary pressures emerge. The NY Fed President very much reiterated the wider FOMC communications but did describe risks to the downside as still significant (some have announced them as less pronounced now), citing trade and geopolitical uncertainty. Williams said overnight repo operations have been very effective and money markets are moving smoothly. <strong>Fed's Evans</strong> (non-voter) said monetary policy is at a good setting currently and he is data dependent, where it would require a lot of new data to change his opinion, echoing other policymakers in that inflation would have to go meaningfully above 2% for him to support monetary tightening. Evans expressed his concern with low inflation but said the economy is strong, although he does see employment growth moderating lower to closer to 100,00 jobs a month.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN INFLATION (NOV)</strong>: CPI Y/Y rose to a six-month high at 2.2% from 1.9%, as expected, with the M/M falling as expected 0.1%. Meanwhile, the BoC's core CPI measures averaged a cycle-high 2.2%. RBC’s analysts suggest the rise in the headline was mainly a result of base effects following the energy price slump in the tail-end of 2018, which it believes should hold inflation above 2% for the Y/Y figure until it washes out around March 2020, although caveats that there is evidence of firming in underlying inflation trends, as seen in the BoC’s average core measures. “We don't think today's inflation data ties the Bank of Canada's hands,” the bank says, adding, “Policymakers will likely be more influenced by next week's October GDP report, which we think will set up for another quarter of sub-trend growth in Q4. That should leave the door open to a rate cut next year, even with underlying inflation now on the high side of 2%.”</p><p><strong>* GERMANY IFO (DEC): </strong>The headline business expectations (seen as a proxy for German growth momentum) rose to 96.3 (exp. 95.5, prev. rev. 95.1), which some desks have taken as another sign of downside risks abating within the German economy. Expectations improved to the best reading since June at 93.8 from 92.3. Sentiment was better in the manufacturing and services industries. The hard data for Q4 has not been painting as optimistic a picture as the Ifo has in recent months, with the former having now seen three consecutive months of improvement in the forward-looking expectations metric. Pantheon Macroeconomics said this is usually a bullish sign of a turning point, but the key question is then how strong the upturn will be, \"At the moment, survey and hard data suggest that the German economy stalled in the second half of 2019, and we expect only a slow pick-up in H1 2020, but a rebound nonetheless.\" The Ifo itself says the data is consistent with German growth of +0.2% in Q4, adding that the German economy was heading into the new year with confidence; though the industrial sector is still in recession, noting it will take a while to get out of it.</p><p><strong>* BOE PREVIEW: </strong>Bank of England Monetary Policy Decision and Minutes due Thursday 19th December at 12:00GMT / 07:00EST. MPC expected to vote 7-2 in favour of standing pat on rates at 0.75%. Post-election uncertainty reprieve could be short-lived as focus shifts to the transition period. Policymakers could be forced to lower rates in 2020 in the absence of an improvement in economic data. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23500/download\"><i>Click here for full preview</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><strong>BOJ PREVIEW: </strong>BoJ Monetary Policy Decision due Thursday 19th December after 02:30GMT / 20:30CST / 10:30HKT. BoJ expected to keep all monetary policy settings unchanged as it has done for the entire of 2019. The latest Japanese data releases have been mixed and would therefore favour a wait and see approach. Governor Kuroda has reiterated the BoJ won't hesitate to ease further if momentum towards the inflation target comes under threat. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23497/download\"><i>Click here for the full preview.</i></a></p><p><strong>* T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLED 9 TICKS LOWER AT 128-05+. </strong>The T-Note, alongside the Bund, moved lower on Wednesday as participants sold duration, with risk appetite remaining elevated in the final few weeks of the year.

The benchmarks had been on the back-foot since the surprise 4.7mln bbl build in crude stocks reported by the API on Tuesday evening. However, the EIA failed to confirm the build and instead reported a 1.1mln bbl draw (vs. exp. -1.3mln), the builds in the products were also less acute than the API report. Elsewhere in the EIA report, Cushing stocks drew by 0.27mln bbls, refinery utilisation remained unchanged, as did production at 12.8mln BPD, whilst net imports fell by 541k BPD to 2.946mln BPD, with both imports falling and exports rising.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.03% at 3192, NDX +0.05% at 8820, DJI -0.09% at 28,241.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>FedEx (FDX)<strong> </strong>traded lower after top and bottom line misses whilst also cutting its FY20 EPS view, noting the decline was due to weak global economic conditions, higher ground costs, loss of business from a large customer. The delivery company also noted the late timing of Thanksgiving saw a shift of Cyberweek into December which negatively impacted results. The results also weighed on competitor UPS (UPS), where analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted the earnings hold a negative read for the company. On the flipside, General Mills (GIS) traded higher after reporting a EPS beat and revenues in line. Its Pet Food sales rose 16% beating estimates for a 15% rise at its Blue Buffalo unit. Cintas (CTAS) were higher after top and bottom line beats, whilst also raising its FY20 EPS forecast.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA)<strong> </strong>printed all-time highs rising 4% after reports it is to cut the price of its Model 3 Sedan in China by 20% or more.

However, all is not clear yet as the two still face regulatory hurdles from both the US and EU. Broadcom (AVGO) Is reportedly looking to sell its RF wireless chip unit, which is reportedly valued at USD 10bln. 9to5 Mac reported an opinion piece that Apple (AAPL) could be a potential suitor as it is already researching its own RF technology, making the tech behemoth a likely suitor. Cigna (CI) sold one of its units which sells non-medical insurance products to employers to New York Life Insurance Co, for USD 6.3bln, whilst also announcing a USD 4bln share repurchase programme. Illumina (ILMN) had its USD 1.2bln deal to acquire Pacific Biosciences of California (PACB) challenged by the FTC, who allege ILMN is aiming to unlawfully maintain a monopoly in the US market for next-gen. DNA sequencing systems by eliminating PACB as a threat. Elsewhere, sources reported that EU antitrust regulators are to unconditionally approve Nvidia’s (NVDA) USD 6.8bln acquisition of Mellanox Technologies (MLNX). The EU antitrust also reportedly cleared conditions of Danaher’s (DHR) USD 21.4bln bid for General Electric (GE) bio-pharma business, where DHR will sell five business to address competitive concerns.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK PREVIEW:</strong> Riksbank Rate Decision due Thursday 19th December 08:30GMT / 09:30CET / 03:30EST. Consensus almost unanimously calls for a 25bp hike to 0.0%.

Recent rhetoric has been minimal, and largely reiterations of the rate most likely remaining unchanged for the period ahead. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23496/download\"><i>Click here for the full preview.</i></a></p><p><strong>* BANXICO</strong> is Thursday 19th December 19:00 GMT / 14:00 EST. The Mexican central bank is expected to cut rates by 25bp to 7.25%, which would be the fourth consecutive rate cut; all sixteen analysts surveyed by Reuters look for a cut. At its last confab, the Banxico opted to lower rates by 25bps; however, two board members, Heath and Esquivel opted for a deeper 50bp cut. The latest minutes revealed that the majority of members said the growth outlook had continued to deteriorate, noting that it was facing risks to inflation, and that monetary policy would be adjusted in a firm and opportune manner. Banxico tends to follow a similar footing to the US Federal Reserve, although now the Fed is on hold; Banxico previously has stated that although it monitors the Fed, it is not a direct determinant for its monetary policy decisions. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/banxico-primer-banxico-are-to-release-its-latest-interest-rate-decision-on-19th-december-2019-at-19-00-gmt-14-00-et-18-12-2019\"><i>Click here for full primer.</i></a></p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>traded firmer again continuing its march over the 97-handle, although finding resistance just shy of the 97.50 level at 97.47. Fed Speak did little to alter the direction, given the comments were all very much in line with the broader Fed view. DXY resides around its 50 WMA 97.36 heading into Asia-Pac trade. <strong>GBP</strong> continued its demise with Cable breaking 1.31 to the downside with 1.3050 the next level of support ahead of tomorrow’s BoE rate decision where the MPC is expected to vote 7-2 in favour of standing pat on rates at 0.75%; today’s inflation data didn’t turn the dial, either. <strong>EUR </strong>traded lower against the buck despite a strong Ifo report, however participants will be eyeing rather large option expiries in the coming days with 2.6bln worth at 1.1150 on EURUSD, plus another 1.1bln at 1.1140-45. <strong>CAD </strong>traded firmer, finding slight strength after its inflation data was very much in line with expectations, although the BoC eyed average of Median/Trim/Common CPI ticked up ever so slightly to 2.17% from 2.07%. <strong>Antipodes</strong> traded flat against the buck, amid no real catalyst as participants await tier 1 data; Aussie jobs and NZ GDP. <strong>Havens</strong> also traded flat amid no further catalyst for price action as markets quieten down heading into the holiday period, however participants will particularly be eying option expiries in USDJPY on Friday where 2.7bln expires at 109.50 strike as well as tonight’s BoJ monetary policy meeting. XAU and CHF both were little changed, although XAU saw slight selling pressure during the session with no fundamental reasoning with desks citing a technical breakout, at the time XAU fell through the 50dma at 1477. In <strong>EMFX</strong>, TRY underperformed once again as the US senate passed a defence bill calling for Turkey sanctions over the S-400 defence system. ZAR initially traded weaker on reports the US is to review the trading status of South Africa, however the Rand pared losses and ended the day firmer against the buck amid Eskom treading through another day without further loadshedding. Also of note, Fitch affirmed South Africa at “BB+”, outlook “Negative”. MXN trades weaker likely on broad dollar weakness ahead of the latest Banxico rate decision tomorrow.</p><p><strong>* UK INFLATION (NOV)</strong>: CPI printed +0.2% M/M, in line with expectations; the Y/Y rate was unchanged at 1.5% against expectations of a fall to 1.4%. The core metric was unchanged at 1.7% Y/Y, in line with the previous and the consensus. Capital Economics said the data probably means the BOE will be content to sit on its hands at tomorrow's MPC meeting; but unless the tone of the economic news improves, there's still a chance that interest rates will be cut early next year, the consultancy wrote.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> China's central bank cut the 14-day reverse repo rate by 5bps, to 2.65%, bolstering the case of those who think it will also cut its 1-year LPR rate on Friday by the same magnitude (to 4.10%). The central bank also injected USD 29bln of liquidity.</p><p><strong>* SNB:</strong> Chair Jordan said he is \"not excluding even more negative rates\", explaining that without negative rates the CHF would see upside, endangering the Swiss economy. The interview follows remarks made last week, where Jordan stated rates would only be lowered further if \"absolutely necessary,\" which some had taken as hawkish. One Swiss bank said it was watching FX and expected the SNB to cut rates if EURCHF fell to 1.06-1.07 before the SNB's March policy decision.</p><p><strong>* JAPAN EXPORTS (NOV):</strong> Japanese exports have fallen for 12 straight months now, with data overnight showing exports now running at a clip of -7.9% Y/Y in November. The data was driven by soft shipments of autos and parts to the US, as well as weaker sales of chemical products to China.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Overall a solid session for the broad Dollar and Index as they continued to consolidate from heavy losses seen last week. Today saw a lack of fresh fundamentals to add to the overall narrative, albeit it’s worth noting that action across markets could be exaggerated in the run-up to Christmas amid holiday-thinned conditions and potential profit-taking/short-covering. US-China news-flow has been light, data has been scarce and speakers quiet. DXY is poised to end the EU session closer to the top of today’s 97.22-48 parameter having surpassed its 50 WMA at 97.36 with the psychological 97.50 mark the next resistance point to monitor. On a more domestic political front – the US House is to vote on the two articles of impeachment regarding the abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Votes are expected to take place between 18:30 and 19:30 local time and President Trump will be impeached if either of the articles are adopted via a simple majority. If so, the trial then begins in the Republican-led Senate, which would require a two-thirds majority to remove Trump from office – seen as highly unlikely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling and Euro look to end the EU day modestly in the red, nonetheless today’s G10 underperformers. GBP/USD has given up the 1.3100 handle amid headwinds from the firmer Buck coupled with lingering jitters about a cliff-edge Brexit, after largely side-lining UK inflation data heading into tomorrow’s BoE Monetary Policy decision (full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite). The pair is poised to end EU trade closer to the bottom of its 1.3060-3134 daily band ahead of mild support at the psychological 1.3050, which also coincides with the 12th Dec low. Meanwhile, downside in the Single Currency had been somewhat cushioned by the EUR/GBP cross which reclaimed 0.85+ status. EUR/USD remains in the red – having clocked an intra-day range of 1.1110-54 and after failing to gain sustained support from overall upbeat German Ifo Survey and mostly unrevised EZ CPI. N.B: JPM notes of an estimated EUR 15-20bln of options structures running off between Thursday and Friday across EUR/USD, EUR/GBP and GBP/USD</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD, JPY</strong></p><p>All flat/modestly positive vs. the USD with the Loonie the standout outperformer among G10s as European markets head into the close. USD/CAD saw losses in light of mostly in-line Canadian inflation figures - but the kicker being a rise in the Median/Trim/Common average (2.17% vs. Prev. 2.07%). The pair looks to end the EU session at the bottom of todays 1.3116-76 parameter ahead of mild support at 1.3114 (16 Dec/05 Nov/25 Jul lows) having breached its 100 WMA (1.3132) to the downside. Meanwhile, the AUD, NZD and JPY are awaiting their respective tier 1 releases in the form of Aussie jobs data, NZ GDP and the BoJ Monetary Policy meeting (full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite) – AUD/USD remains within a tight band around 0.6850 (0.6839-59 daily range), NZD/USD resides just above 0.6550 (0.6554-80 intraday parameter), and USD/JPY ~109.50 having clocked in a daily range of 109.40-109.63 thus far.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira has remained the EM underperformer after US senate passed a defence bill calling for Turkey sanctions over its purchase of the S-400 defence system – a bill which now falls into the hands of US President Trump for signing. The Turkish Defence Ministry responded that the bill contained hostile elements towards Turkey, in a sign that the relationship between the two countries are further deteriorating. USD/TRY has gained 5.900+ status to a high of 5.9200 (vs. low of 5.8829). Meanwhile, the ZAR experienced some weakness in early EU trade following source reports that the US is to review South Africa’s trade status at the end of January next year. USD/ZAR pared back earlier upside and reversed course to session lows (14.2818-4581 range), potentially on stabilisation on the Eskom front – which expects no load shedding today despite constrained systems, although the Rand may have received solace in anticipation of Fitch’s rating, which was affirmed.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Global stocks are holding near record highs, and although there has been some profit-taking into year-end, investors who had been holding back are being compelled to get into the market now after news of US/China 'phase one', Nomura says.</li><li>Nomura says sentiment has continued to improve, noting that its own gauge has moved from 'optimism' to 'euphoric'.</li><li>\"Once sentiment crosses the line into euphoria, what often unfolds is an 'aerial dogfight' featuring the careless use of leverage and a wave of unusually rapidly executed direction trades,\" Nomura writes, \"the result is the destabilization of the market trend.\" It adds that the standard move in these circumstances is to take profits and/or brace for downside.</li><li>Any downside may be limited, given the better macro news of late, Nomura says. However, it says that the present year-end rally is steeper than the historical norm, and it sees a scenario in which global equities peak sometime over the holidays, and then let off pressure in self-sustaining fashion for a time, possibly even through 20th January or so. \"Although we expect a drawdown of 3% or more over this span, this period could turn out to be a welcome dip-buying opportunity, provided that the aforementioned good news remains true.\"</li><li>Nomura thinks that hedge funds' recent equity buying has an element of wishful thinking, and says that although the global economy is just showing the first signs of having begun to pick up, hedge funds have built up positions that appear premised on the idea that a V-shaped recovery in the global economy is already in the offing. \"When this overdone optimism comes in for a reality check at the start of the new year, it seems unlikely that a middling pace of economic recovery will live up to speculators' expectations.\"</li><li>Looking at hedge fund strategies, Nomura suggests funds with a top-down view have been the strongest proponents of a bullish scenario. \"We think something looks off-kilter in the way the market tone is quickly swinging to the supposition that the first-stage US-China trade agreement will bring about a seamless run of improvement in economic growth and corporate earnings, as if to justify the positions that hedge funds already hold.\"</li><li>The bank explains that global macro hedge funds' net long exposure to DM equities has in fact pulled far away to the upside from the Citi Major Economies Economic Surprise Index. \"The same economic surprise index, meanwhile, has a clear seasonal tendency to improve through the end of the year (led by such factors as the holiday shopping season in the US) only to deteriorate with the start of the new year,\" and \"given how high macro-oriented investors have set their sights, we think investors will need to pay close attention to whether the Citi Major Economies Economic Surprise Index comes up short of the market's overly high expectations in 2020.\"</li><li>Meanwhile, for CTAs and risk-parity funds, Nomura says algo traders are not buying stocks to the extent that macro funds are. It says CTAs are adding to their net long position in S&amp;P 500 futures. \"For as long as the S&amp;P 500 holds above 3,110 (which we estimate to be the average entry point for CTAs' net buying since the end of October), CTAs look likely to keep up their trend-chasing buying,\" Nomura writes.</li><li>At the same time, end investors in the US have been increasing their buying of stocks through ETFs. \"Of course, these investors are not algorithmic players, and their investment horizons differ from those of CTAs,\" nomura says, but it notes that ETF investments are essentially a trend-chasing strategy of sorts, and trend-following flows have been robust in both the futures market and the ETF market.</li><li>At the same time, Nomura says CTAs have also been selling bond futures, holding a small net long position in UST futures (TY), and the bank will be watching to see whether they tentatively exit their remaining longs at 10yr UST yields of 1.90% or higher. \"However, CTAs have already closed out more than 90% of the net long position in DM government bond futures (UST futures, JGB futures, Euro-Bund futures, and Gilt futures) that they held as of the end-of-August peak,\" and \"unless CTAs swing to going short, the systematic and unilateral bond-selling therefore looks likely to peter out.\"</li><li>Finally, Nomura notes that the positioning of risk-parity funds has seen a building up long positions in DM equities, but their exposure does not look overheated in the way it did in early 2018. \"Their selling of investment-grade bonds since the summer has also come to a halt, so we expect there to now be less systematic bond-selling pressure associated with risk-parity funds' portfolio rebalancing.\"</li></ul>",

(Newswires) Co. shares declined almost 7% in after-market trade.</p><p>A choppy day thus far for European stocks [Eurstoxx 50 +0.2%] following on from a mixed APAC session as markets quietened ahead of the Christmas holidays. Sectors are broadly mixed with some underperformance seen in consumer discretionary whilst staples outperform. The session has been mostly driven by individual stock movers – Fiat Chrysler (-0.1%) and Peugeot (+1.2%) have officially announced an agreement for a 50/50 merger in a EUR 50bln deal – with annual run-rate synergies expected at around USD 3.7bln.&nbsp; Before the deal is closed, Fiat Chrysler stated it will distribute a special dividend of EUR 5.5bln while PSA will distribute to its shareholders its 46% stake in Faurecia (-1.5%). Further, Fiat Chrysler notes that its robot-making unit Comau is to be spun off after the merger. Elsewhere, FTSE-listed NMC Health (-0.5%) opened higher to the tune of 10% (following yesterday’s 20% drop) after the Co. reaffirmed its guidance and announced a GBP 200mln share buyback programme in response to Muddy Water’s negative note. Meanwhile, postal names including Deutsche Post (-0.7%), Royal Mail (-2.8%) and Austrian Post (-0.7%) all experience headwinds from FedEx’s (-7.4% pre-market) earnings last night which saw the company downgrade its EPS forecast alongside dismal earnings, citing weak global economic conditions. Elsewhere, Volvo (+4.1%) shares are supported after the Co. and Isuzu Motors (7202 JT) are mulling a strategic alliance. Volvo sees a positive impact on operating profit of SEK 2bln from the alliance. Finally, further angst for Scandi banks after the Swedish FSA opened as opened a sanctions case against the Co. and a probe into SEB’s (-1.6%) governance and control of measures to combat money laundering. FSA plans to communicate the outcome of the case in April 2020.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY, CNH - The broad Dollar and Index remains in positive territory thus far in a continuation of the upside seen overnight, with the DXY meandering just under current weekly highs and its 50 WMA, both near 97.360 – somewhat of a barrier in recent trade. News-flow on the US-Sino front has been quiet overnight, with US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin singing from the same hymn sheet as recent WH officials. Nonetheless, the lack of details regarding the Phase One deal has prompted caution among traders and investors. This tone is reflected in CNY and CNH, with the offshore choppy on either side of 7.000 vs. the USD and with a lack of conviction and awaiting further headlines. Meanwhile, today’s docket sees little by way of State-side data, although speakers include Fed’s Board of Governor member Brainard and 2020 non-voter Evans.</p><p>EUR, GBP - Both trading modestly softer vs. the Buck and flat against each other. Sterling has held onto a bulk of yesterday’s losses and dipped below 1.3100 overnight before finding a base at around 1.3070 – with little reaction seen in light of mixed UK inflation metrics, in which headline CPI modestly topped forecasts alongside RPI, albeit PPI printed sub-par ahead of the BoE’s monetary policy update tomorrow. Elsewhere, EUR/USD saw very mild solace upon the German Ifo’s rosy release with all three metrics beating forecasts and priors seeing revisions higher. The institute added that the German Q4 German GDP is likely to increase by 0.2%. Aside from that, the Single Currency was little swayed by mostly unrevised EZ CPI figures with EUR/USD choppy within a tight 1.1127-54 intraday band (having retreated further below its 200 DMA at 1.1152). That said, decent option expiries may prompt some action amid holiday-thinned trade – with EUR 1.3bln expiring between strikes 1.1125-35 and a further EUR 1.6bln between 1.1140-50.</p><p>AUD, NZD, CAD, JPY - All flat and within tight ranges vs. the USD in early EU trade, albeit more on the back of a firmer Buck as opposed to individual weakness – with the high beta on standby for their respective tier one data/events (aside from trade news-flow). AUD/USD hovers around 0.6850 at time of writing ahead of the much-anticipated Aussie jobs data due overnight as an indication of the RBA’s next policy move. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart remains relatively sideways and just north of 0.6550 and ahead of its 50 WMA (0.6585) with NZ Q3 GDP on the radar. USD/CAD remains just above the 1.3150 mark and with little inspiration from softer energy prices as the Loonie looks ahead to its November CPI readings – with headline YY seen ticking higher in the month. Analysts at JPM believe that the USD/CAD risk-reward remains skewered towards to the topside as the bank sees the BoC reducing rates at least once next year – “CPI sticking around target shouldn’t challenge that, but if it were to come off, then it would be another excuse to cut”, JPM says. Finally, USD/JPY trades lacklustre just under the 109.50 mark ahead of the BoJ Monetary Policy Decision due to be released sometime during the Tokyo lunch break (Full preview available on the Newsquawk headline feed).</p><p>EM - The Turkish Lira has seen renewed weakness after US senate passed a defence bill calling for Turkey sanctions over its purchase of the S-400 defence system – a bill which now falls into the hands of US President Trump for signing. The Turkish Defence Ministry responded that the bill contained hostile elements towards Turkey, in a sign that the relationship between the two countries are further deteriorating. USD/TRY has gained 5.900+ status to a high of 5.9200 (vs. low of 5.8829). Meanwhile, the ZAR experienced some weakness in early EU trade following source reports that the US is to review South Africa’s trade status at the end of January next year. USD/ZAR has pared back earlier upside, potentially on stabilisation on the Eskom front – which expects no loadshedding today despite constrained systems.</p><p>US is to review South Africa's preferential trade status on January 30th., according to sources.

Ahead of tomorrow’s BoE meeting, CPI came in at 1.5% YY, in-line with the prev. and slight above market expectations; although the BoE themselves do see inflation coming under renewed pressure on the effect of energy price caps (which were a hinderance last month). On the release, Gilts came under some mild pressure dropping by around 10 ticks to a session low of 131.94, albeit the dip below 132.0 was short-lived. German’s 10yr bond was similarly dented on the Ifo release where all metrics beat expectations and Ifo noted the German economy is moving into 2020 with confidence. However, CapEco believe the survey indicates the economy, while no-longer on a significant downward path, is still weak and will stagnate in Q4 at best. In terms of reaction, Bunds dipped to a session low of 171.96 (yesterday’s low) just after the release; for reference, further support lies just below at 171.81. Within the periphery, Greek debt is supported on reports that the ECB may allow Greek banks to increase their holdings of domestic debt. Stateside, it’s a relatively quiet session aside from some Fed speak from Evans at a Q&amp;A which will not include a text release. In terms of price action, the curve is bull flattening at present, but not by a significant margin.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>WTI and Brent are around USD 0.50/bbl lower at present but remain above the USD 60/bbl and USD 65/bbl levels respectively. News-flow for the crude complex, and generally, has been light this morning with price action continuing to be dictated by the surprise API build of 4.7mln barrels (Exp. draw 1.2mln barrels); ahead of today’s EIA release where expectations are for a headline draw of 1.288mln barrels. Looking ahead, UBS note that a extended period of inventory builds often begins in Q1 due to the gap between winter demand and US driving season; which, while expected they believe may prompt some profit taking. Elsewhere, spot gold is firmer by just shy of USD 3/oz and resides near the top of the sessions range, but remains below yesterday’s high of USD 1480.35/bbl. Finally, copper prices remain within a narrow range for the session given a quiet APAC session and no further updates, as of yet, on the US-China front.</p><p>API Energy Inventories Crude +4.7mln vs. Exp. -1.3mln (Prev. +1.4mln).

        "content": "<p>Debt hasn’t drifted too far from the unchanged mark for the session thus far which has been relatively quiet ahead of the year’s final Super Thursday. Ahead of tomorrow’s BoE meeting, CPI came in at 1.5% YY, in-line with the prev. and slight above market expectations; although the BoE themselves do see inflation coming under renewed pressure on the effect of energy price caps (which were a hinderance last month). On the release, Gilts came under some mild pressure dropping by around 10 ticks to a session low of 131.94, albeit the dip below 132.0 was short-lived. German’s 10yr bond was similarly dented on the Ifo release where all metrics beat expectations and Ifo noted the German economy is moving into 2020 with confidence. However, CapEco believe the survey indicates the economy, while no-longer on a significant downward path, is still weak and will stagnate in Q4 at best. In terms of reaction, Bunds dipped to a session low of 171.96 (yesterday’s low) just after the release; for reference, further support lies just below at 171.81. Within the periphery, Greek debt is supported on reports that the ECB may allow Greek banks to increase their holdings of domestic debt. Stateside, it’s a relatively quiet session aside from some Fed speak from Evans at a Q&amp;A which will not include a text release. In terms of price action, the curve is bull flattening at present, but not by a significant margin.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region lacking conviction in the absence of any fresh catalysts and following a relatively quiet session on Wall Street heading into the holiday season, where stocks consolidated around record highs due to the improved trade climate and after several encouraging tier-2 data releases. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are mixed with defensives just about offsetting the losses in miners, tech and financials to keep Australia afloat, while sentiment in Tokyo is weighed by adverse currency flows and mixed trade data in which Exports contracted for a 12th consecutive month albeit at a slightly narrower than expected decline. Hang Sang (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are positive but with gains limited by the diminishing effects from the US-China phase one agreement, while minimal upside was also seen despite the PBoC’s first liquidity injection in 21 sessions in which it injected a total of CNY 200bln via 7-day and 14-day reverse repos at a reduced rate (2.65% vs Prev. 2.70%) on the 14-day operation.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY remains slightly firmer and marginally extends above the 97.00 level after the recent flurry of better than expected data releases including Industrial Production and Housing Starts. The greenback also benefits from recent weakness in its major counterparts with EUR/USD retreating from its 200DMA of 1.1152 and with GBP/USD continuing its rout to below 1.3100 after Brexit cliff fears were triggered by government plans to rule out any extension to the transition period through an amended WAB. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are lower amid the lacklustre risk appetite in Japan and mixed trade data, while antipodeans are also uneventful due to their high beta statuses and after a relatively stable CNY reference rate.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher following the bull-steepening in the US and with the BoJ also in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities, but with gains limited as the BoJ kicks start its 2-day policy meeting.&nbsp;</p>",
