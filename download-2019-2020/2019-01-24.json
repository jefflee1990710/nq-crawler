Focus for the press conference largely centred around the Bank&rsquo;s assessment of the growth outlook for the Euro-area with policymakers opting to classify risks as now being &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo; vs. their prior view of &lsquo;moving to the downside&rsquo;. That said, from a policy perspective, little has changed at the ECB with President Draghi stating that the implications for monetary policy from today&rsquo;s assessment tweak were not discussed. When he was questioned about the lack of urgency to tweak policy, Draghi revealed a split in views between policymakers with some foreseeing a more benign outlook for the EZ. As has historically been the case with the ECB, the Bank has more of a tendency to make such adjustments at meetings which are accompanied by macro-economic projections and thus March might be viewed as a more opportune time for the central bank to act. Elsewhere on the policy front, the matter of TLTROs was raised during the press conference with Draghi stating that the matter was brought up by several officials, but no decision was taken as the monetary case for a fresh round needs to be presented. Thus, the main takeaway from the announcement was the central bank acknowledging the risks surrounding their outlook but not taking any preventative measures at this juncture. From a rates perspective President Draghi noted that when the market prices the first rate hike in 2020, it shows they have understood the ECB&rsquo;s reaction function. Elsewhere, interestingly, the central bank believes there is a profit squeeze, and it is a matter of time before higher wages are passed through. Overall, ING concludes &ldquo;the ECB will try to buy as much time as possible in the coming months to see how the March folly will evolve&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;we will probably have to wait until the June meeting before the dust has settled. Until then, the ECB will be on higher alert than before&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US Commerce Secretary Ross warned that the US and China are &quot;miles and miles&quot; away from a trade resolution, though highlighting that there is a fair chance a deal will be made. He believes that both sides want a trade deal and he announced that they will be releasing two separate statements after trade talks next week. Also, White House Economic Advisor Kudlow said he believes Trump is rather optimistic on US-China trade talks while stating that the jobs report for January will be &quot;up&quot;. In later comments, US Treasury of Secretary Mnuchin stated that the US and China are making a lot of progress&quot; in talks and he is looking forward to the meetings next week when the yuan currency issues will also be discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>As expected, the USD 5.7bln bill supported by US President Trump to reopen the government lacked votes to clear the Senate hurdle. A senator suggested that a bipartisan plan to open the government for three weeks will be offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Russia&#39;s Putin and Venezuela&#39;s Maduro confirmed their desire to continue cooperation in &quot;various ways&rdquo; while White House National Security Advisor Bolton claimed that the Trump administration is focused on cutting off Venezuela&#39;s Maduro from revenue sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US COMP MARKIT PMI (FLASH)</strong> came in at 54.5 in January, a tad above the previous 54.4. The Manufacturing index rose to 54.9 from 53.8, beating expectations of 53.5; the gains in business conditions were attributed to an expansion in production which begun in May 2018 which continue to boost confidence among manufacturers. The Services index moderated slightly to 54.2 from 54.4, but still holding up well despite new business growth remaining subdued; the sector employment index posted at 52, below the previous 53.6, the lowest since April 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS </strong>fell by more than expected, to 199k from 213k, the lowest reading since 1969. Analysts at Pantheon however note that this level is likely unsustainable and believe that a sub-200 reading was unexpected given people affected by the govt shutdown making claims. They continue to view that the Q4 rise was due to hurricanes and wildfires in California rather than a weakening labour market as they believe &ldquo;firms are scared to let people go unless they have no other choice, because it&rsquo;s so hard to recruit &ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.51 HIGHER AT USD 53.31/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.05 LOWER AT USD 61.09/BBL. </strong>Crude managed to pick itself up off of lows following a bearish API report on Wednesday, and seemed to take its cue from the overall risk sentiment, while the heavier grades of crude were firmer following events in Venezuela; Russia&#39;s energy minister Novak said there was not any proposals for an emergency OPEC/non-OPEC meeting due to the situation there. &quot;So far, the uncertainty looks to be boosting prices for similar heavy sour crudes from Mexico, Canada, and the US Gulf of Mexico, but futures traders seem to be taking a more cautious approach,&quot; Citi said. Crude has also generally looked through inventory builds reported by both the API on Wednesday and the DOE on Thursday, as US production levels remained unchanged in the week, at the record 11.9mln BPD. Elsewhere, there was support from Libya, where several ports were closed due to bad weather conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.12% at 2641, NASDAQ +0.66% at 6702, DJI +0.09% at 24554. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.55%, Materials -0.54%, Industrials +0.59%, Cons Discretionary -1.44%, Cons Staples +0.32%, Healthcare -0.97%, Financials +0.27%, Tech +0.58%, Telecoms -1.37%, Utilities +0.10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Several semiconductor stocks reported earnings before the open today with Texas Instruments (TXN), Lam Research (LRCX) and Xilinx (XLNX) all printing strong figures pulling up the sector, with Lam Research announcing USD 5bln of share repurchases; Intel (INTC) traded higher ahead of its earnings this evening. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Jet Blue (JBLU) also reported stronger than expected earnings, pulling up the airline industry on the day. Bristol Myers (BMY) opened lower after withdrawing a drug application, despite reporting EPS and revenue figures above estimates. Union Pacific (UNP) outperformed after beating top and bottom line estimates. Nielsen (NLSN) opened higher on the announcement of renewed efforts to sell itself. Vertex (VRTX) opened lower after it terminated its interim CFO and COO. Broker moves saw Fiserv (FISV) and Synchrony (SYF) move higher on the open following upgrades at Cowen and Oppenheimer respectively. Conversely, CenturyLink (CTL) and Mondelez (MDLZ) moved lower on the open after downgrades at Guggenheim and Berenberg respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 121-24. </strong>Renewed demand for the safe haven sent treasuries higher on Thursday &nbsp;amid a mix of factors including a dovish ECB, Ross cautious comments on US and China trade talks as well as Germany&rsquo;s downgrade to its 2019 growth forecasts. Solid PMI data took the complex off highs but were not enough for a change of direction. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed close to the unchanged mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>A rollercoaster day for the Dollar and broad index as US Commerce Secretary Ross highlighted the lack of progress between US and China in trade talks as the ECB press conference went underway. The DXY spiked higher to levels just shy of 96.600 after gradually strengthening throughout the day, though safe-haven gains in the JPY alongside Wilbur Ross&rsquo; caveat of his earlier comment caused the index to pare back gains. Overall the buck is poised to end the day marginally firmer with the DXY around 96.240 nearer to the bottom of a 96.000-5800 intraday range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Choppy session for the Euro amid the dismal PMIs which triggered the initial decline in the single currency during early European trade and with downside exacerbated by the press conference after the ECB interest decision in which rates were left untouched as expected. Heading into Draghi&rsquo;s press conference, EUR/USD ticked lower, albeit more on the back of a spiking Dollar to the aforementioned negative US-China trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross. Shortly after, Draghi downgraded the language surrounding the risk to EZ growth as &ldquo;have moved to the downside&rdquo; from the prior &ldquo;moving to the downside&rdquo;. This exacerbated losses in the single currency in which EUR/USD fell to lows last seen in mid-December last year (at 1.1308), whilst the non-discussion of TLTROs or the implications of the change in the balance of risk did not soothe sentiment around the market. In later trade the EUR continued its depreciation, printing fresh session lows at around 1.1288, after Germany cut its 2019 GDP forecast to 1.0% from 1.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, GBP: A</strong> cautious and choppy day for the JPY amid an indecisive risk tone around the market in which USD/JPY traded within a 109.43-80 range. Additionally, trade-negative comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross flushed demand into safe-haven currencies before his caveat unwound some risk premium. Meanwhile, during the ECB press conference, EUR/JPY whipsawed from a low of 123.98 back up to around 124.50 before stabilising around the middle of a 123.98-124.90 band. Moving on, Sterling was largely side-lined as Brexit news (largely reiterations) did little to move the currency, Cable was heavily dictated by Dollar action as the pair is poised to end the day near the middle of 1.3012-94 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>More doom and gloom for the antipodeans after the AUD was heavily dented from the release of the Australian jobs data which initially provided some support for the currency amid above-forecast employment change and below-forecast unemployment rate, thought the Aussie fully pared back initial gains as markets digested the full release in which growth in employment was mostly fuelled by part-time jobs which coincided with the decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside in the AUD as some suggest this could aid the RBA to push back a rate hike, especially given the decline in house prices, while downbeat trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross added further fuel to the fire. AUD remained the G10 underperformer throughout the day as AUD/USD fell from highs of 0.7166 to a low print of 0.7081. Meanwhile the NZD initially fell in sympathy with its antipodean counterpart, albeit to a much lesser extent as the demise of the Aussie underpinned the Kiwi via the AUD/NZD cross. NZD/USD traded within a 0.6755-0.6805 band, and stabilised at the bottom of that range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>A firmer day for the Crown in the aftermath of a hawkish Norges interest rate decision in which the CB left its key policy rate unchanged as expected. Focus was more on whether a rate hike will be pushed further into H1 with an intention to hike in March, which the Central Bank left unchanged. Norges also noted that the domestic economic growth and labour market developments appear to be broadly in-line with forecasts while inflation has been slightly above expectations. Subsequently, EUR/NOK is poised to end the day closer to the bottom of a 9.7130-7600 range. Meanwhile, the SEK bore the brunt of a rising NOK as the NOK/SEK pair rose around 0.6%.</p>\r\n",

The Manufacturing index rose to 54.9 from 53.8, beating expectations of 53.5; the gains in business conditions were attributed to an expansion in production which begun in May 2018 which continue to boost confidence among manufacturers. The Services index moderated slightly to 54.2 from 54.4, but still holding up well despite new business growth remaining subdued; the sector employment index posted at 52, below the previous 53.6, the lowest since April 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS </strong>fell by more than expected, to 199k from 213k, the lowest reading since 1969. Analysts at Pantheon however note that this level is likely unsustainable and believe that a sub-200 reading was unexpected given people affected by the govt shutdown making claims. They continue to view that the Q4 rise was due to hurricanes and wildfires in California rather than a weakening labour market as they believe &ldquo;firms are scared to let people go unless they have no other choice, because it&rsquo;s so hard to recruit &ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.51 HIGHER AT USD 53.31/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.05 LOWER AT USD 61.09/BBL. </strong>Crude managed to pick itself up off of lows following a bearish API report on Wednesday, and seemed to take its cue from the overall risk sentiment, while the heavier grades of crude were firmer following events in Venezuela; Russia&#39;s energy minister Novak said there was not any proposals for an emergency OPEC/non-OPEC meeting due to the situation there. &quot;So far, the uncertainty looks to be boosting prices for similar heavy sour crudes from Mexico, Canada, and the US Gulf of Mexico, but futures traders seem to be taking a more cautious approach,&quot; Citi said. Crude has also generally looked through inventory builds reported by both the API on Wednesday and the DOE on Thursday, as US production levels remained unchanged in the week, at the record 11.9mln BPD. Elsewhere, there was support from Libya, where several ports were closed due to bad weather conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.12% at 2641, NASDAQ +0.66% at 6702, DJI +0.09% at 24554. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.55%, Materials -0.54%, Industrials +0.59%, Cons Discretionary -1.44%, Cons Staples +0.32%, Healthcare -0.97%, Financials +0.27%, Tech +0.58%, Telecoms -1.37%, Utilities +0.10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Several semiconductor stocks reported earnings before the open today with Texas Instruments (TXN), Lam Research (LRCX) and Xilinx (XLNX) all printing strong figures pulling up the sector, with Lam Research announcing USD 5bln of share repurchases; Intel (INTC) traded higher ahead of its earnings this evening. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Jet Blue (JBLU) also reported stronger than expected earnings, pulling up the airline industry on the day. Bristol Myers (BMY) opened lower after withdrawing a drug application, despite reporting EPS and revenue figures above estimates. Union Pacific (UNP) outperformed after beating top and bottom line estimates. Nielsen (NLSN) opened higher on the announcement of renewed efforts to sell itself. Vertex (VRTX) opened lower after it terminated its interim CFO and COO. Broker moves saw Fiserv (FISV) and Synchrony (SYF) move higher on the open following upgrades at Cowen and Oppenheimer respectively. Conversely, CenturyLink (CTL) and Mondelez (MDLZ) moved lower on the open after downgrades at Guggenheim and Berenberg respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 121-24. </strong>Renewed demand for the safe haven sent treasuries higher on Thursday &nbsp;amid a mix of factors including a dovish ECB, Ross cautious comments on US and China trade talks as well as Germany&rsquo;s downgrade to its 2019 growth forecasts. Solid PMI data took the complex off highs but were not enough for a change of direction. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed close to the unchanged mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>A rollercoaster day for the Dollar and broad index as US Commerce Secretary Ross highlighted the lack of progress between US and China in trade talks as the ECB press conference went underway. The DXY spiked higher to levels just shy of 96.600 after gradually strengthening throughout the day, though safe-haven gains in the JPY alongside Wilbur Ross&rsquo; caveat of his earlier comment caused the index to pare back gains. Overall the buck is poised to end the day marginally firmer with the DXY around 96.240 nearer to the bottom of a 96.000-5800 intraday range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Choppy session for the Euro amid the dismal PMIs which triggered the initial decline in the single currency during early European trade and with downside exacerbated by the press conference after the ECB interest decision in which rates were left untouched as expected. Heading into Draghi&rsquo;s press conference, EUR/USD ticked lower, albeit more on the back of a spiking Dollar to the aforementioned negative US-China trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross. Shortly after, Draghi downgraded the language surrounding the risk to EZ growth as &ldquo;have moved to the downside&rdquo; from the prior &ldquo;moving to the downside&rdquo;. This exacerbated losses in the single currency in which EUR/USD fell to lows last seen in mid-December last year (at 1.1308), whilst the non-discussion of TLTROs or the implications of the change in the balance of risk did not soothe sentiment around the market. In later trade the EUR continued its depreciation, printing fresh session lows at around 1.1288, after Germany cut its 2019 GDP forecast to 1.0% from 1.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, GBP: A</strong> cautious and choppy day for the JPY amid an indecisive risk tone around the market in which USD/JPY traded within a 109.43-80 range. Additionally, trade-negative comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross flushed demand into safe-haven currencies before his caveat unwound some risk premium. Meanwhile, during the ECB press conference, EUR/JPY whipsawed from a low of 123.98 back up to around 124.50 before stabilising around the middle of a 123.98-124.90 band. Moving on, Sterling was largely side-lined as Brexit news (largely reiterations) did little to move the currency, Cable was heavily dictated by Dollar action as the pair is poised to end the day near the middle of 1.3012-94 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>More doom and gloom for the antipodeans after the AUD was heavily dented from the release of the Australian jobs data which initially provided some support for the currency amid above-forecast employment change and below-forecast unemployment rate, thought the Aussie fully pared back initial gains as markets digested the full release in which growth in employment was mostly fuelled by part-time jobs which coincided with the decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside in the AUD as some suggest this could aid the RBA to push back a rate hike, especially given the decline in house prices, while downbeat trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross added further fuel to the fire. AUD remained the G10 underperformer throughout the day as AUD/USD fell from highs of 0.7166 to a low print of 0.7081. Meanwhile the NZD initially fell in sympathy with its antipodean counterpart, albeit to a much lesser extent as the demise of the Aussie underpinned the Kiwi via the AUD/NZD cross. NZD/USD traded within a 0.6755-0.6805 band, and stabilised at the bottom of that range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>A firmer day for the Crown in the aftermath of a hawkish Norges interest rate decision in which the CB left its key policy rate unchanged as expected. Focus was more on whether a rate hike will be pushed further into H1 with an intention to hike in March, which the Central Bank left unchanged. Norges also noted that the domestic economic growth and labour market developments appear to be broadly in-line with forecasts while inflation has been slightly above expectations. Subsequently, EUR/NOK is poised to end the day closer to the bottom of a 9.7130-7600 range. Meanwhile, the SEK bore the brunt of a rising NOK as the NOK/SEK pair rose around 0.6%.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Euro tilts the downside as Draghi downgrades EZ outlook",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong> &ndash; A rollercoaster day for the Dollar and broad index as US Commerce Secretary Ross highlighted the lack of progress between US and China in trade talks as the ECB press conference went underway. The DXY spiked higher to levels just shy of 96.600 after gradually strengthening throughout the day, though safe-haven gains in the JPY alongside Wilbur Ross&rsquo; caveat of his earlier comment caused the index pare back gains. Overall the buck is poised to end the day marginally firmer with the DXY around 96.240 nearer to the bottom of a 96.000-5800 intraday range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong>&ndash; Choppy session for the Euro amid the dismal PMIs which triggered the initial decline in the single currency during early European trade and with downside exacerbated by the press conference after the ECB interest decision in which rates were left untouched as expected. Heading into Draghi&rsquo;s press conference, EUR/USD ticked lower, albeit more on the back of a spiking Dollar to the aforementioned negative US-China trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross. Shortly after, Draghi downgraded the language surrounding the risk to EZ growth as &ldquo;have moved to the downside&rdquo; from the prior &ldquo;moving to the downside&rdquo;. This exacerbated losses in the single currency in which EUR/USD fell to lows last seen in mid-December last year (at 1.1308), whilst the non-discussion of TLTROs or the implications of the change in the balance of risk did not soothe sentiment around the market. The EUR then staged a recovered as the ECB acknowledged the risks to the downside but noted it will not take accommodative measures, amidst this and a pullback in the Dollar, EUR/USD is poised to end of day nearer to the top of a 1.1307-1.1391 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY, GBP </strong>&ndash; A cautious and choppy day for the JPY amid an indecisive risk tone around the market in which USD/JPY traded within a 109.43-80 range. Additionally, trade-negative comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross flushed demand into safe-haven currencies before his caveat unwound some risk premium. Meanwhile, during the ECB press conference, EUR/JPY whipsawed from a low of 123.98 back up to around 124.50 before stabilising around the middle of a 123.98-124.90 band. Moving on, Sterling was largely side-lined as Brexit news (largely reiterations) did little to move the currency, Cable was heavily dictated by Dollar action as the pair is poised to end the day near the middle of 1.3012-94 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD </strong>&ndash; More doom and gloom for the antipodeans after the AUD was heavily dented from the release of the Australian jobs data which initially provided some support for the currency amid above-forecast employment change and below-forecast unemployment rate, thought the Aussie fully pared back initial gains as markets digested the full release in which growth in employment was mostly fuelled by part-time jobs which coincided with the decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside in the AUD as some suggest this could aid the RBA to push back a rate hike, especially given the decline in house prices, while downbeat trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross added further fuel to the fire. AUD remained the G10 underperformer throughout the day as AUD/USD fell from highs of 0.7166 to a low print of 0.7085. Meanwhile the NZD initially fell in sympathy with its antipodean counterpart, albeit to a much lesser extent as the demise of the Aussie underpinned the Kiwi via the AUD/NZD cross. NZD/USD traded within a 0.6762-0.6807 range, before stabilising between its 50 and 100 DMA at 0.6796 and 0.6774 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOK, SEK</strong> -&nbsp; A firmer day for the Crown in the aftermath of a hawkish Norges interest rate decision in which the CB left its key policy rate unchanged as expected. Focus was more on whether a rate hike will be pushed further into H1 with an intention to hike in March, which the Central Bank left unchanged. Norges also noted that the domestic economic growth and labour market developments appear to be broadly in-line with forecasts while inflation has been slightly above expectations. Subsequently, EUR/NOK is poised to end the day closer to the bottom of a 9.7130-7600 range. Meanwhile, the SEK bore the brunt of a rising NOK as the NOK/SEK pair rose around 0.6%.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>10-year Bund futures broke session highs and are the days outperformer, setting a new monthly high of 165.29 after the assertion by ECB&rsquo;s Draghi that the risks to EZ growth outlook have &ldquo;moved to the downside&rdquo; in the post rate decision press conference after rates were left unchanged. This alters the previously used &ldquo;moving to the downside&rdquo; language and highlights the increasing worries about soggy growth figures in Europe, geopolitical concerns and financial market volatility. The in-focus TLTRO programme was discussed but no action was taken and the German benchmark struggled to hold at highs, paring some of the days gains to trade just above the 165.00 handle as of recent trade. 10-year Gilt futures also printed a fresh session peak of 123.24, trade near this figure, and are largely being driven by events in the mainland with very light Brexit news flow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, whilst some attention is being placed on events in Europe, the main focus for the additional lift in US debt futures has come from events stateside. 10yr US futures hit session peaks of 121-24+ after assertions from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the US and China are nowhere near a deal whilst US Initial Jobless Claims collapsed to lows not seen since 1969. Potential upcoming risk events come from any potential trade or Government shutdown updates.</p>\r\n",

(Yonhap/Dong-A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are in the green [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.7%]. The FTSE MIB (+1.2%) is outperforming its peers bolstered by strong performance in banking names after Italian PM Conte said the Italian banking system is well capitalised and stable; with markets also looking out for any potential signals from the ECB on TLTROs. Sectors are mixed, with outperformance in tech names following STMicroelectronics (+8.8%) earnings release; other tech names such as Infineon (+4.9%) are up in sympathy. Other notable movers include, Novozymes (-3.5%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after missing on Q4 sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, GBP- The EUR is ultimately on the backfoot as dismal French PMIs triggered the decline in the single currency in which the composite output pointed to the quickest contraction in the French private sector output for over four years, according the IHS. Meanwhile, Germany&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI fell into contractionary territory and to a 50-month low while the manufacturing output index slid to a 69-month low. In terms of the Eurozone, ING highlights that the below-forecast metrics indicates Q1 is off a disappointing start, heavily influence by France. Furthermore, IHS Markit&rsquo;s Chief Economist notes &ldquo;The disappointing survey data indicate that [Eurozone] GDP is rising at a quarterly rate of just 0.1%.&rdquo; As such, EUR/USD fell further below its 200 DMA at 1.1384 to test the intraday low 1.1330 to the downside before stabilising just above its LOD ahead of the ECB interest rate decision later where focus will be on the EZ growth outlook (full preview available in the Research Suite). In terms of option expiries, a sizeable EUR 2.2bln are scatter at strike 1.1395-1.1405. Meanwhile, Sterling is largely side-lined following days of gains as the ECB decision comes into focus, Cable is heavily dictated by dollar action as the pair resides near intraday lows below 1.3050 (vs high of 1.3094)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Back on an upward trajectory follow the prior session&rsquo;s declines in which the index tested 96.000 to the downside at one point. In early EU trade, DXY gained more ground above psychological level and currently resides near intraday highs of 96.400 with upside exacerbated by the release of overall downbeat EZ PMIs. In terms of technicals, the index has breached its 100 DMA to the upside at 96.100 and sees its 200 DMA around 96.550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; The marked underperformer amid the release of Australian jobs numbers, where the Aussie initial felt support as headline employment change and the unemployment rate were better-than-expected, thought gains were pared as the growth in employment was mostly fuelled by part-time jobs which coincided with the decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside in the AUD as some suggest this could aid the RBA to push back a rate hike, especially given the decline in house prices, subsequently, interest rate futures are pricing a 60% chance of a rate cut by December 2019. As such AUD/USD lost more ground below its 100 DMA at 0.7171 to levels below 0.7100 vs. a high of 0.7166. Furthermore, HSBC sees AUD/USD declining to 0.6600 this year and Rabobank sees the pair at 0.6800 citing &#39;doom loop&#39; of debt which threatens to weigh heavily on the currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK &ndash; A firmer Crown in the aftermath of a hawkish Norges interest rate decision in which the CB left its key policy rate unchanged as expected. Focus was more on whether a rate hike will be pushed further into H1 given the recent decline in oil, which the Central Bank left unchanged.

The FTSE MIB (+1.2%) is outperforming its peers bolstered by strong performance in banking names after Italian PM Conte said the Italian banking system is well capitalised and stable; with markets also looking out for any potential signals from the ECB on TLTROs. Sectors are mixed, with outperformance in tech names following STMicroelectronics (+9.4%) earnings release; other tech names such as Fingerprint Cards (+2.9%) and Infineon (+5.0%) are up in sympathy. Other notable movers include, Novozymes (-3.4%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after missing on Q4 sales. Elsewhere, Fevertree (+10.7%) are in the green after the Co sees FY outcome considerably ahead of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, GBP- The EUR is ultimately on the backfoot as dismal French PMIs triggered the decline in the single currency in which the composite output pointed to the quickest contraction in the French private sector output for over four years, according the IHS. Meanwhile, Germany&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI fell into contractionary territory and to a 50-month low while the manufacturing output index slid to a 69-month low. In terms of the Eurozone, ING highlights that the below-forecast metrics indicates Q1 is off a disappointing start, heavily influence by France. Furthermore, IHS Markit&rsquo;s Chief Economist notes &ldquo;The disappointing survey data indicate that [Eurozone] GDP is rising at a quarterly rate of just 0.1%.&rdquo; As such, EUR/USD fell further below its 200 DMA at 1.1384 to test the intraday low 1.1340 to the downside before stabilising just above its LOD ahead of the ECB interest rate decision later where focus will be on the EZ growth outlook (full preview available in the Research Suite). In terms of option expiries, a sizeable EUR 2.2bln are scatter at strike 1.1395-1.1405. Meanwhile, Sterling is largely side-lined following days of gains as the ECB decision comes into focus, Cable is heavily dictated by dollar action as the pair resides near intraday lows below 1.3050 (vs high of 1.3094)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Back on an upward trajectory follow the prior session&rsquo;s declines in which the index tested 96.000 to the downside at one point. In early EU trade, DXY gained more ground above psychological level and currently resides near intraday highs of 96.400 with upside exacerbated by the release of overall downbeat EZ PMIs. In terms of technicals, the index has breached its 100 DMA to the upside at 96.100 and sees its 200 DMA around 96.550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; The marked underperformer amid the release of Australian jobs numbers, where the Aussie initial felt support as headline employment change and the unemployment rate were better-than-expected, thought gains were pared as the growth in employment was mostly fuelled by part-time jobs which coincided with the decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside in the AUD as some suggest this could aid the RBA to push back a rate hike, especially given the decline in house prices, subsequently, interest rate futures are pricing a 60% chance of a rate cut by December 2019. As such AUD/USD lost more ground below its 100 DMA at 0.7171 to levels below 0.7100 vs. a high of 0.7166. Furthermore, HSBC sees AUD/USD declining to 0.6600 this year and Rabobank sees the pair at 0.6800 citing &#39;doom loop&#39; of debt which threatens to weigh heavily on the currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK &ndash; A firmer Crown in the aftermath of a hawkish Norges interest rate decision in which the CB left its key policy rate unchanged as expected. Focus was more on whether a rate hike will be pushed further into H1 given the recent decline in oil, which the Central Bank left unchanged. Norges also noted that the domestic economic growth and labour market development appear to be broadly in-line with forecasts while inflation has been slightly above expectations. Subsequently, EUR/NOK fell through the 9.7500 to a low print of 9.7130 (vs high of 9.7600) and currency hovers closer to the bottom of the intraday band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; More influenced by Dollar action, though moves in USD/JPY could be muted amid the decline is the single currency as EUR/JPY falls below 124.50 (vs. high 124.90).

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong>- The EUR is ultimately on the backfoot as dismal French PMIs triggered the decline in the single currency in which the composite output pointed to the quickest contraction in the French private sector output for over four years, according the IHS. Meanwhile, Germany&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI fell into contractionary territory and to a 50-month low while the manufacturing output index slid to a 69-month low. In terms of the Eurozone, ING highlights that the below-forecast metrics indicates Q1 is off a disappointing start, heavily influence by France. Furthermore, IHS Markit&rsquo;s Chief Economist notes &ldquo;The disappointing survey data indicate that [Eurozone] GDP is rising at a quarterly rate of just 0.1%.&rdquo; As such, EUR/USD fell further below its 200 DMA at 1.1384 to test the intraday low 1.1340 to the downside before stabilising just above its LOD ahead of the ECB interest rate decision later where focus will be on the EZ growth outlook (full preview available in the Research Suite). In terms of option expiries, a sizeable EUR 2.2bln are scatter at strike 1.1395-1.1405. Meanwhile, Sterling is largely side-lined following days of gains as the ECB decision comes into focus, Cable is heavily dictated by dollar action as the pair resides near intraday lows below 1.3050 (vs high of 1.3094)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong> &ndash; Back on an upward trajectory follow the prior session&rsquo;s declines in which the index tested 96.000 to the downside at one point. In early EU trade, DXY gained more ground above psychological level and currently resides near intraday highs of 96.400 with upside exacerbated by the release of overall downbeat EZ PMIs. In terms of technicals, the index has breached its 100 DMA to the upside at 96.100 and sees its 200 DMA around 96.550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD </strong>&ndash; The marked underperformer amid the release of Australian jobs numbers, where the Aussie initial felt support as headline employment change and the unemployment rate were better-than-expected, thought gains were pared as the growth in employment was mostly fuelled by part-time jobs which coincided with the decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside in the AUD as some suggest this could aid the RBA to push back a rate hike, especially given the decline in house prices, subsequently, interest rate futures are pricing a 60% chance of a rate cut by December 2019. As such AUD/USD lost more ground below its 100 DMA at 0.7171 to levels below 0.7100 vs. a high of 0.7166. Furthermore, HSBC sees AUD/USD declining to 0.6600 this year and Rabobank sees the pair at 0.6800 citing &#39;doom loop&#39; of debt which threatens to weigh heavily on the currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOK</strong> &ndash; A firmer Crown in the aftermath of a hawkish Norges interest rate decision in which the CB left its key policy rate unchanged as expected. Focus was more on whether a rate hike will be pushed further into H1 given the recent decline in oil, which the Central Bank left unchanged. Norges also noted that the domestic economic growth and labour market development appear to be broadly in-line with forecasts while inflation has been slightly above expectations. Subsequently, EUR/NOK fell through the 9.7500 to a low print of 9.7130 (vs high of 9.7600) and currency hovers closer to the bottom of the intraday band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; More influenced by Dollar action, though moves in USD/JPY could be muted amid the decline is the single currency as EUR/JPY falls below 124.50 (vs. high 124.90). Meanwhile, USD/JPY trades with modest gains and resides around the top of an intraday 109.44-77 band ahead of the Tokyo inflation release overnight.</p>\r\n",

This comes ahead of some key supply from France who are looking to auction off EUR 8-9bln in their multi-tranche OAT auction. In the UK, 10-year Gilt futures are in the green but trade near session lows of 122.64 as the gap higher on the open has been slowly but surely eliminated as focus remains on updates from Whitehall on Brexit, with the possibility of some direction to be found from multiple scheduled speeches from BoE Governor Carney later in the day at Davos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the US, debt futures have rebounded after yesterdays lows of 121-07 with futures higher across the curve and the majority of the action in the belly of the curve. The suggestions that the White House is preparing for the shutdown lasting up to March has helped the bid in US futures, which has seen the 10-yr print session highs of 121-19, with 121-20 eyed as resistance. Further direction may be found from the upcoming manufacturing and services PMI releases scheduled for later in the day.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were mixed throughout the majority of the session as corporate updates dictated price action and in which energy names kept Australia afloat after Santos reported an increase in Q4 output and revenue, while Japanese exporters lacked unison amid an indecisive currency. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.4%) were initially lacklustre amid ongoing trade uncertainty and following another substantial daily liquidity drain by the PBoC of CNY 250bln, but then gradually improved as money market rates declined ahead of the 2nd phase of the PBoC&rsquo;s 100bps RRR taking effect tomorrow. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with price moves contained by the indecision across riskier assets throughout the sessions and amid mixed results at this month&rsquo;s 20yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 250bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7802 (Prev. 6.7969)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said talks are going well with China but added that tariffs could increase if no deal is reached. In addition, there comments from Director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute Michael Pillsbury, who is US President Trump&#39;s outside China advisor and a noted China hawk, that there will not be a breakthrough in trade talks soon. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Securities Regulatory Commission Official Fang thinks there will be a deal in US-China trade talks and suggested that US President Trump measures his successes by the rise and fall in US stocks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoK kept 7-Day Repo Rate unchanged at 1.75% as expected via unanimous decision. BoK stated that South Korean growth is to hover below prior projections and that government spending is to hold up growth, while it added employment condition is sluggish and that inflation is to fluctuate at 1% for some time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Haldane said BoE is likely to increase rates if economy keeps growing but will be flexible in the event of a downturn. (Newswires)<br /><br />UK opposition Labour Party leader Corbyn is said to likely back bill to force government to request extension of Article 50, while there were also reports that nearly 20 UK ministers have reportedly been conducting a secret meeting in Parliament to discuss plans to avert a no-deal Brexit. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brussels is reportedly to sue the UK regarding tax breaks for commodities traders. (FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback traded lacklustre and is in proximity to test a breakdown of the 96.00 level amid concerns of the shutdown effects on the economy which White House adviser Hassett suggested could result to 0% growth in Q1, while its major counterparts retained the majority of recent gains with GBP/USD firmly above 1.3000 amid rising hopes of a potential extension to Article 50. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses were indecisive as they reflected the similar overnight risk tone, while AUD/USD whipsawed with initial support from better than expected Employment Change and a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate. However, gains were then pared as the growth in employment was solely fuelled by part-time jobs and coincided with a decline in the Participation Rate, while reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates due to higher funding costs later wiped out gains for AUD as some suggested this could restrict RBA from increasing rates especially considering the backdrop of declining house prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Change (Dec) 21.6K vs. Exp. 16.5K (Prev. 37.0K). (Newswires)<br />Australian Full Time Employment (Dec) -3.0k (Prev. -6.4k)<br />Australian Unemployment Rate (Dec) 5.0% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 5.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Participation Rate (Dec) 65.6% vs. Exp. 65.7% (Prev. 65.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly sideways amid the choppy risk sentiment overnight with WTI crude futures mildly pressured following an unexpected build in headline API crude stockpiles, while Brent crude failed to hold above the USD 61.00/bbl level. Elsewhere, an uneventful greenback kept gold prices within this week&rsquo;s tight range and copper also flatlined due to the flimsy risk tone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (18 Jan) +6.55mln vs. Exp. -0.4mln (prev. -0.560mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is reportedly building up gold reserves in shift away from the dollar. (Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the US is recognising Juan Guaido as Venezuela&#39;s interim President after the opposition leader declared himself the interim head of state, while President Trump said US could impose Venezuelan oil sanctions this week if the political situation worsens and that all options are on the table for Venezuela. Furthermore, there were later comments from the Venezuela Defense Minister that the armed forces disavow the self-proclaimed President. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea leader Kim said he will advance &#39;step by step&#39; toward goal agreed with US, while there were separate reports that US and North Korea may agree to complete denuclearisation by 2020. (Yonhap/Dong-A)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although volumes were better, it was another range-bound session for the Treasury complex. Overnight, news US/China talks were making progress helped spur selling, and when the US day got underway, some decent corporate earnings numbers offered support to risk assets, to the detriment of the T-Note. There was also some inspiration from the UK, where Gilts were sold on the hope that hard Brexit can be avoided. However, after the US cash equity open, stocks struggled to build on the optimism, and slid, which gave support to the T-Note. Major curve spreads were mixed, and generally +/- 1bps at settlement. US T-note futures (H9) settled 6 ticks lower at 121-12+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House Speaker Pelosi said she would not pass a resolution allowing President Trump to deliver the State of the Union address from the House chamber until the government reopens, while there were also comments from US President Trump that he will do something &quot;alternative&quot; to the State of the Union address. However, Trump then later said he will deliver State of the Union Address when shutdown is over. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is reportedly considering executive actions separate from emergency declaration to fund border wall according to CNN, while there were reports in Washington Post that the White House is said to be making preparations in case the shutdown lasts into March. (CNN/Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House Tax Committee cancelled a planned Thursday hearing regarding shutdown impact on IRS and tax season. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets remain choppy as the region fails to take full impetus from the gains in US where the DJIA led the majors higher on better than expected earnings from several of its components, but with upside in the other majors capped amid ongoing shutdown concerns and trade uncertainty. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are mixed as corporate updates dictate price action and with energy names keeping Australia afloat after Santos reported an increase in Q4 output and revenue, while Japanese exporters lack unison amid an indecisive currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp (+0.1%) are lacklustre amid ongoing trade uncertainty and following another substantial daily liquidity drain by the PBoC of CNY 250bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback trades lacklustre and is in proximity to test a breakdown of the 96.00 level amid concerns of the shutdown effects on the economy which White House adviser Hassett suggested could result to 0% growth in Q1, while its major counterparts retain the majority of recent gains with GBP/USD firmly above 1.3000 amid hopes of a potential extension to Article 50. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses are indecisive as they reflected a similar overnight risk tone, while AUD/USD is somewhat turbulent with the pair initially supported by better than expected Employment Change and a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate. However, gains were then pared as the growth in employment was solely fuelled by part-time jobs and coincided with a decline in the Participation Rate, while reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates due to higher funding costs later wiped out gains for AUD as some suggested this could restrict RBA from increasing rates especially considering the backdrop of declining house prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price moves contained by the indecision across riskier assets and ahead of a 20yr JGB auction later.</p>\r\n",
