The M/M and Q/Q rates of expansion were in line with expectations at 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. “However, details were much more positive than the headline print would imply” observe TD Securities, which notes that inventories and net exports contributed to 1.6% and 0.5% drags to growth respectively, the latter owing to softer goods exports. A key driver for the headline print, notes the bank, was the 10.7% increase in fixed business investment, which it says reflects a robust performance on both the residential and non-residential side. Moreover, adds TD, non-residential investment growth was revised higher by 9.2% for Q2, which “will be viewed as a welcome development even if headline growth was revised marginally lower to 3.5% from 3.7%.” The bank concludes that the BoC should be relieved to see a rebound in business investment, but caveat that with trade uncertainty still elevated, a hawkish pivot at next week's meeting is unlikely, rather the Bank is more likely to remain in a wait-and-see mode.</p><p><strong>* HUAWEI: </strong>The US is mulling new regulations to further restrict Huawei suppliers, according to sources cited by Reuters, who say the US is not happy with the existing blacklist as it has not cut off supplies to the Chinese telecoms co. The supposed regulations would would block more shipments to Huawei and comes at a time when the US just last week agreed granted some reprieves on the existing ban.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG: </strong>UBS think the macro-economic impact of the signing of the Hong Kong Bill will be limited. Although the annual autonomy status certification could periodically escalate concerns over Hong Kong's status, “many of the new assessment elements already effectively exist to a certain extent in the 1992 Act,” note UBS. The bank gives the example that the existing annual Hong Kong policy report already provides some assessments in areas such as autonomy and export controls. However, more importantly, notes UBS, is that “with or without the bill the US President already has the right to suspend or resume any special treatments based on the considerations of Hong Kong's autonomy status.” The bank concludes that the 2019 Act does not alter the nature of the existing assessment, nor would it change the probability of outcomes meaningfully. Meanwhile, although China has strongly condemned the bill and accused the US of interfering in China’s internal affairs, their response so far is being seen as more of a slap on the wrist; the drafter of the bill will be barred from entry into China, Hong Kong or Macau. This has led many desks, including UBS, to view that China is trying to keep the issue of Hong Kong separate from its trade discussions with the US.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> UK Election Panelbase poll on Friday put Conservatives at 42% (unch.), whilst Labour at 34% (+2). This poll puts the differential between Labour and the Conservatives at 8%, at the lower end of the range of differentials from other polls, which range between 7% - 13%.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB Board Member Nominee Schnabel, who is poised to replace ECB Hawk Lautenschlager, stated it’s September stimulus package could be justified by current inflation data as well as the outlook inflation over the medium term. Schnabel also added that accommodative monetary policy stimulus continues to be needed.<strong> </strong>ECB Board Nominee Panetta also spoke, stating the ECB must constantly be alert to potential unintended consequence of monetary policy on the financial system, adding incoming information indicates growth slowdown proving to be more protracted than expected. On the recent ECB stimulus package, he noted it was appropriate and proportionate, highlighting monetary policy support is required to ensure that financial conditions remain favourable.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE:</strong> WTI and Brent futures sunk shortly after the energy cash market open, despite a lack of immediate fundamental catalysts at the time, prompting analysts to speculate that month-end factors were at play. Front month WTI and Brent contracts drifted lower thereafter, having before spent much of the session range bound around the USD 58.00/bbl and USD 63.00/bbl regions, respectively. In the background, and not doing the crude complex any favours, expectations for a roll-over of the current OPEC+ agreement until next year (likely 1st June) appear near set in stone; Russian Energy Minister Novak was out today saying that he favours taking a decision on the extension of OPEC+ deal closer to 1st April 2020, in fitting with the narrative of Russian reluctance for the cartel to pursue further production cuts in the near term. Moreover, the OPEC’s Economic Commission Board yesterday advised that the group extend existing cuts to mid-2020. Elsewhere in crude specific news flow, we got supply updates for OPEC and the US; OPEC output for the month of November fell 110k BPD to 29.57mln BPD due to lower supply from Angola, Saudi, Iraq and Nigeria, according to a major newswire survey. The biggest output drop was seen in Angola, where production fell 140k BPD due to field maintenance. Over in the US, EIA reported that US crude oil production for the month of September rose to 12.463mln BPD up from 12.397mln BPD a month earlier. US total oil demand in September was also higher, by 138k BPD on a Y/Y basis, at 20.221mln BPD. Meanwhile, US crude exports rose to 3.092mln BPD in September, from 2.727mln BPD in August.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.4% at 3141, NASDAQ-100 -0.5% at 8404, Dow Jones -0.4% at 28051.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.8%, Consumer Staples -0.1%, Energy -1%, Financials -0.2%, Health Care -0.4%, Industrials -0.5%, Information Technology -0.3%, Materials -0.5%, Telecommunication Services -0.4%, Utilities -0.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Adobe Analytics reported Black Friday sales as being on track to reach a record USD 7.4bln, of note for retailers (WMT, AMZN). Tech Data (TECD) surged after it agreed to be acquired Apollo (APO) for USD 145/share, beating Warren Buffet’s (BRK.B) USD 140 offer. Energy stocks took a hit from the lower crude prices, although, Chevron (CVX) announced it would be selling its stakes in two Nigerian offshore assets. United Steel (X) tumbled on the open following reports its largest plant had been forced to shut due to flooding from a pipe leak. PG&amp;E (PCG) took a hit after a bankruptcy judge ruled in favour of victims from fires. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was hindered from weaker metals prices</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLE 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 129-09+: </strong>T-Notes traded flat to close the final trading session of the week. The complex took its cues in a thin liquidity environment given the early Thanksgiving closure, which also saw a lack of pertinent updates. Treasury futures sold off in the tail-end of the European session, however as the early close approached, some of the losses were pared. By settlement yields were little changed on the day.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD: </strong>The Dollar has displayed a decent degree of resilience in the face of several month end bank models signalling sell orders for month end and ranging from strong against certain rival currencies to more modest vs others. In fact, the DXY finally scaled resistance ahead of 98.500 on the final trading session of November, albeit with volumes still thin due to the hangover from Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday and into another early US close. Nevertheless, the index notched a fresh weekly high with the aid of weakness elsewhere, more constructive US-China Phase 1 deal vibes (overall and at face value), firmer US Treasury yields and some upbeat US data (Q3 GDP, durable goods and weekly claims).</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Not Friday’s G10 winner, but among the best major performers over the week largely on reduced risks of a hung UK Parliament after next month’s GE, especially following YouGov’s MRP results that carry more weight than other polls given the accuracy of past pre-vote predictions, like 2017. However, the findings of the so called regression and post-stratification survey come with a potentially crucial caveat concerning a 5% statistical variance or margin of error for 30 of the seats projected to be won by Tories out of a 68 majority, so the actual outcome could yet be closer than suggested. Hence, Cable has handed back some gains from circa 1.2950, but bounced from a fleeting fall below the 21 DMA, while Eur/Gbp got close to 0.8500 at one stage as the Euro remained laboured in general.</p><p><strong>* NZD/SEK: </strong>The Kiwi and Swedish Krona have also secured healthy net gains on a combination of supportive fundamental/macro factors and bullish technical impulses. Nzd/Usd is consolidating gains above 0.6400 and 1.0550 in AUD cross terms, although off best levels, with the aid of encouraging NZ retail sales data, plus improvements in business and consumer morale in contrast to the Aussie that was undermined by a couple of dovish RBA outlooks over 1 bank upgrading its forecast and weaker than expected private sector credit that all kept Aud/Usd capped below 0.6800. Similarly, the Sek has outpaced its Scandi counterpart, as firmer than forecast anticipated Swedish Q3 GDP (headline at least) embellished a partly chart-based rally that was already underway. Eur/Sek tested bids/support around the psychological 10.5000 level mark at one stage, while a downturn in oil helped to fuel Eur/NOK to a new weekly peak near 10.1600 vs 10.0650 at the other extreme.</p><p><i>Click </i><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/weekly-fx-wrap-roll-on-december-after-relatively-drab-run-in-to-end-of-current-month-29-11-2019\"><i>here</i></a><i> for the rest of the weekly FX wrap.</i></p><p><strong>* SPD LEADERSHIP VOTE: </strong>Germany’s Social Democrat party (SPD) will on Saturday select a new leader, with the contest potentially having an impact on the German government coalition (the victor will be ratified at a party congress on 6th December). The new SPD leader’s first task will be to decide if they will continue a coalition with Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU party. The frontrunners, current Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and his running mate Klara Heywitz, are both committed to the coalition, but analysts say ‘all bets are off’ if the Scholz team loses, given that Walter-Borjans and his running mate Esken have suggested that they would re-negotiate the coalition agreement, and could leave if a negotiation was not possible, potentially opening the door to snap elections. In terms of the market impact, analysts at Rabobank say that A Scholz victory would likely be neutral, though a Walter-Borjans win might see bunds sell-off given that there will be speculation that CDU/CSU may see spending a little more as a preferable route rather than an end to the coalition, followed by elections (the current German government has suggested that it would consider fiscal stimulus in the event that Germany entered recession). Rabo caveats, however, that in reality it would be surprised to see that, given that even in that scenario, it finds it difficult to see an appreciable rise in the deficit.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has displayed a decent degree of resilience in the face of several month end bank models signalling sell orders for month end and ranging from strong against certain rival currencies to more modest vs others. In fact, the <strong>DXY </strong>finally scaled resistance ahead of 98.500 on the final trading session of November, albeit with volumes still thin due to the hangover from Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday and into another early US close. Nevertheless, the index notched a fresh weekly high with the aid of weakness elsewhere, more constructive US-China Phase 1 deal vibes (overall and at face value), firmer US Treasury yields and some upbeat US data (Q3 GDP, durable goods and weekly claims).</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Not Friday’s G10 winner, but among the best major performers over the week largely on reduced risks of a hung UK Parliament after next month’s GE, especially following YouGov’s MRP results that carry more weight than other polls given the accuracy of past pre-vote predictions, like 2017. However, the findings of the so called regression and post-stratification survey come with a potentially crucial caveat concerning a 5% statistical variance or margin of error for 30 of the seats projected to be won by Tories out of a 68 majority, so the actual outcome could yet be closer than suggested. Hence, Cable has handed back some gains from circa 1.2950, but bounced from a fleeting fall below the 21 DMA, while Eur/Gbp got close to 0.8500 at one stage as the Euro remained laboured in general.</p><p><strong>NZD/SEK</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Swedish Krona have also secured healthy net gains on a combination of supportive fundamental/macro factors and bullish technical impulses. Nzd/Usd is consolidating gains above 0.6400 and 1.0550 in <strong>AUD</strong> cross terms, although off best levels, with the aid of encouraging NZ retail sales data, plus improvements in business and consumer morale in contrast to the Aussie that was undermined by a couple of dovish RBA outlooks over 1 bank upgrading its forecast and weaker than expected private sector credit that all kept Aud/Usd capped below 0.6800. Similarly, the Sek has outpaced its Scandi counterpart, as firmer than forecast anticipated Swedish Q3 GDP (headline at least) embellished a partly chart-based rally that was already underway. Eur/Sek tested bids/support around the psychological 10.5000 level mark at one stage, while a downturn in oil helped to fuel Eur/<strong>NOK</strong> to a new weekly peak near 10.1600 vs 10.0650 at the other extreme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>The traditional safe havens (and Gold), have been choppy amidst fluctuating risk sentiment, conflicting data and mostly dovish BoJ/SNB policy guidance and perceptions, but with the Yen and Franc both comparatively rangebound between 108.64-109.66 and 1.0022-0.9961 respectively, while Xau/Usd held just above 1450/oz and a whisker under 1463.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>The single currency has been reluctant to build on forays beyond 1.1000 vs the Buck, but also pretty repellent against downside breaks amidst mixed Eurozone macro releases, hefty option expiry interest above the round number and decent technical support into bids reportedly sitting at 1.0970. Meanwhile, the Loonie has meandered either side of a steadily rising 200 DMA and inside 1.3260-1.3318 on the wide, with a portion of layered offers said to be residing from 1.3300-30 soaked up ahead of Canadian Q3/monthly GDP before a slightly better than consensus annualised print pushed the pair back down through 1.3300.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes across the region, as the Rand maintained positive momentum through 15.0000 and Latams regained some composure thanks to official intervention, but the Lira and Mexican Peso remained depressed due to ongoing US-Turkey angst over arms, Syria and sanctions, while Banxico minutes revealed dovish rate intensions via two dissenters voting for a 50 bp ease hot on the heels of downgrades to 2019 and 2020 GDP estimates.</p>",

However, the buck stopped a few ticks above the 200 DMA and the DXY remains close to a new intraday/wtd peak of 98.545 amidst broad US Dollar strength or weakness in counterparts. Conversely, bonds are still mainly going through the motions ahead of another early US close and with many across the Atlantic extending their Thanksgiving celebrations through Friday, though Gilts did muster up enough momentum to notch a fresh Liffe session high at 133.21 before reversing to an equally minor low alongside Bunds and Treasuries as the clock ticks down to the Wall Street open.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/SEK</strong></p><p>The major outperformers and movers outside of recent ranges, as an improvement in NZ consumer confidence gives the Kiwi a further fillip following more upbeat business sentiment or less bleak to be precise on Thursday. Nzd/Usd is extending gains above 0.6400 and threatening to break free from the 0.6425 level that has been keeping the pair tethered, while Eur/Sek is now eyeing the psychological 10.5000 mark in wake of firmer than forecast Swedish Q3 GDP that has given the Swedish Krona a fundamental lift on top of renewed bullish technical impetus after the cross retreated through 10.5500 chart support more convincingly.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Far from hero to zero, but Sterling is losing more of its YouGov pre-UK election poll mojo with negative month end cross winds also weighing on the Pound via Eur/Gbp demand. Cable has now lost grip of the 1.2900 handle and briefly slipped below the 21 DMA (1.2884), while 0.8500 continues to cushion the aforementioned cross.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Dollar that is still doing well if not quite defying gravity amidst rebalancing models flagging various strains of Greenback selling for month end (<strong>DXY</strong> holding ‘comfortably’ above 98.000 and towards the upper end of a 98.412-301 range). The Aussie is trying to piggy-back its Antipodean counterpart, but remains top heavy into 0.6800 and Aud/Nzd has pulled back from 1.0550 again after weaker than expected private sector credit data overnight. In similar vein, Eur/Usd seems destined to stay anchored around 1.1000 with yet more hefty option expiries hampering attempts to the upside vs decent technical support limiting losses beneath the big figure, while mixed Eurozone data is broadly being ignored. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy, Usd/Cad and Usd/Chf are also treading familiar ground in narrow parameters of 109.60-45, 1.3292-79 and parity-0.9980 respectively, with the Yen torn between conflicting Japanese data and standard BoJ policy rhetoric from Governor Kuroda, Franc largely shrugging off a decline in the Swiss KOF indicator and Loonie awaiting Canadian GDP along with any USMCA developments for some independent direction.</p>",

The Thanksgiving holiday saw a lack of any pertinent updates in the day. However, last night US President Trump signed the HK bill as expected, implying a sell-off in US equity futures as participants were concerned regarding the potential implications to trade talks. The Chinese were quick to vow to retaliate, however the retaliation is likely to put the drafters of the bill on an entry ban to Mainland China, Hong Kong &amp; Macau, according to China Global Time. The retaliation, so far, appears not so severe, potentially a promising sign. Over in the UK, YouGov released its MPR model, which put Conservatives at a 68-seat majority, the results put a bid into GBP pushing cable to test resistance at 1.2950, before paring back to 1.29 during the day as USD strengthened slightly and gradually.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia markets were mostly subdued after the holiday closure stateside for Thanksgiving Day and amid continued trade uncertainty, despite a more conciliatory tone from China’s State Council and with the retaliation so far to US President Trump's Hong Kong bill signing seen as a mere slap on the wrist. ASX 200 (-0.3%) initially prodded record levels but with gains later reversed by underperformance in miners and the largest weighted financials sector, while the opening gains for the Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) eventually succumbed to the pressure from currency flows and substandard data in which Industrial Production matched its worst contraction since January last year. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) declined as markets second-guessed China’s retaliation measures for the HK bill and after PBoC’s inaction this week resulted to a CNY 300bln net liquidity drain, with the losses in the Hong Kong benchmark exacerbated as all its components resided in negative territory following the recent increased IPO activity and as the city braces for a resumption of protests over the weekend. Finally, 10yr JGBs weakened in an extension of yesterday’s post-2yr auction selling pressure and with demand also kept subdued by the lack of BoJ presence in the market, as well as mixed Japanese data releases.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia markets are mostly subdued after the holiday closure stateside for Thanksgiving Day and amid continued trade uncertainty, despite a more conciliatory tone from China’s State Council and with the retaliation so far to US President Trump's Hong Kong bill signing seen a mere slap on the wrist. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are mixed with the Australian index prodding record levels but with gains tempered by underperformance in gold miners and the largest weighted financials sector, while the initial gains in Tokyo eventually succumbed to the pressure from currency flows and substandard data in which Industrial Production matched its worst contraction since January last year. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are lower as markets second-guess China’s retaliation measures for the HK bill and after PBoC’s inaction this week resulted to a CNY 300bln net liquidity drain, with the losses in Hong Kong benchmark exacerbated as all its components reside in negative territory following the recent increased IPO activity and as the city braces for a weekend of protests.</p><p>In FX markets, USD is lacklustre with price action kept rangebound amid the holiday-quietened conditions in US and with the currency also unmoved despite China’s conciliatory tone and suggestions it is leaving the door open for a trade deal. The greenback’s transatlantic peers are also uneventful with EUR/USD consolidating again at the bottom end of the 1.1000 handle after the recent slew of uninspiring Euro-wide confidence data and soft German inflation figures, while the momentum in GBP/USD following the YouGov MRP projection of a majority victory for PM Johnson's Conservatives, has all but faded with the pair languishing near 1.2900 after having failed to surmount the post-poll high around 1.2950. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slightly pulled back after mixed data including firmer than expected headline Tokyo CPI coupled with abysmal Industrial Production numbers, and antipodeans are kept flat following varied second-tier data releases, while a bout of heavy selling pressure was seen in USD/MXN early in the session despite no news catalyst which was attributed to technical selling in thin conditions following a break of this week’s uptrend line in the hourly chart.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they extended on yesterday’s post-2yr auction selling pressure and with demand also kept subdued by the lack of BoJ presence in the market and mixed Japanese data releases.</p>",
