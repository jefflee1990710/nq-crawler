        "content": "<p>The Aussie jobs report is expected to show 10k jobs being added the Aussie economy in January, from a prior 28.9k. The participation rate is seen unchanged, but the jobless rate is expected to rise by one-tenth to 5.2%. Westpac's analysts note that job creation has slowed recently, mirroring the loss of momentum in the broader economy. The three-month moving average currently shows around 14.5k jobs being added per month, which represents a slowdown from a monthly pace of around 25k in mid-2019. \"We expect job gains to continue at this slower pace, as suggested by business surveys and with GDP growth stuck at around a 2% annualised pace,\" Westpac says. Bushfires are an obvious headwind for the January data, though this is more likely to hit hours worked rather than the actual jobs numbers, Westpac thinks. Elsewhere, analysts have said that the January data could be subject to some uncertainty with the ABS updating population estimates. Ahead of the jobs data, the Q4 wage prices index will be released yesterday showed the pace steady at 0.5% Q/Q and 2.2% Y/Y, as expected.</p>",

Economic fundamentals have not changed, economy faces several challenged - will fend off major financial risks, comprehensively use multiple monetary policy tools and keep the Yuan basically stable. (Newswires)</p><p>German Finance Minister Scholz, on the coronavirus, said will be ready to act when necessary, but is monitoring developments. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>Over 700 people in Washington state are reportedly being publicly supervised for coronavirus. The figure includes close contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, as well as people who have returned from China in the past 14 days, according to WSBT. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FOMC</strong></p><p>FOMC Minutes stated that Members saw distribution of risks to economic activity as “somewhat more favourable” than at the prior meeting, current stance of policy likely to remain appropriate “for a time” providing information remains broadly consistent with outlook. Minutes added that economic growth expected to continue at a “moderate pace” and most expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range could be misperceived. Meanwhile, policymakers cited easing of trade tensions, receding Brexit risks and stabilising global growth as reducing downside risks but also generally expected trade uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated. Furthermore, the release noted that once reserves reach ample levels, regular open market operations would be required over time to accommodate trend growth in Fed’s liabilities and maintain ample reserves and several participants suggested committee resume before long discussion of possibly creating a standard repo facility. <i><strong>Market reaction was muted as the release was in-line with expectations and Fed rhetoric.</strong></i></p><p>Fed's Kashkari (Voter, Dove) said if he were to guess they will likely be here for the next three to six months and the next move would be a cut but if there were a positive shock, hikes could be called for. When asked about the impact of the coronavirus, he said all the data he sees from China is viewed with a sceptical eye and added that it is unlikely that the US would be immune from virus-related slowdown. (Newswires) <i>N.B. The Fed's current median view is for rates to be left unchanged throughout 2020. Current Fed pricing expects 27bps worth of easing by the September meeting and 40bps through year end.</i></p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>German finance minister Scholz expects G20 to make progress on global minimum tax level for companies, and new tax rules for tech giants. On the German economy, Scholz said there are no signs of the entering recession, and says it is sticking to 2020 GDP growth view of 1.1%, despite virus risks. (Newswires)</p><p>EU27 ambassadors couldn't agree on Michel Barnier's negotiating mandate today – France still holding out on the level-playing field demands, according to Express's Barnes. (Express) French European Affairs Minister said we would not wish to sign a bad post-Brexit deal with the UK on December 31st, just for the sake of having a deal signed, ready for any scenario. (Newswires)</p><p>EU trade chief Hogan said the US is displaying more goodwill in talks around trade. Washington Governor Jay Inslee said lawmakers must act to address WTO issues to avoid EU retaliatory tariffs that would hurt Boeing (BA) and commercial aircrafts (Newswires)</p><p>Data Recap: - UK CPI YY (Jan) 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.6% (Prev. 1.3%) (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>Turkish CBT Weekly Repo Rate* (Feb) 10.75% vs. Exp. 10.75% (Prev. 11.25%) (Newswires) - Current policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path; course of inflation is considered to be broadly in-line with the year-end inflation projection.

Risk sentiment notably improved on hopes of China stimulus, while the coronavirus narrative now seems to be coalescing on the notion of a V-shaped recovery; the US data docket has also been supportive, adding to the argument that the expansion can continue.

Analog Devices (ADI) led gains in the SOX space after its earnings report which beat on EPS, where it also increased its dividend. Nvidia (NVDA) also performed well following an upgrade at Bernstein, which highlighted the upcoming analyst day on March 19th and the Mellanox (MLNX) acquisition being completed as potential upside catalysts for the name. Tesla (TSLA) saw another stellar day following yet another PT upgrade for the automaker; Piper Sandler raised its PT to USD 928 citing potential success in its batteries and solar business could be the fuel to the next rally. American Airlines (AAL) pushed back its expected 737 MAX return to service to August 10th from June 4th, whilst also noting it expects continued discussions in terms of compensation from Boeing (BA) as it continues to take a hit this year. Nike (NKE) had an executive shake up where Andy Campion will be COO (currently EVP and CFO) and Matthew Friend (currently CFO of operating segments and VP of Investor relations) will be CFO from April 1st.

Talk of China stimulus was cited for the yen moves, though the greenback also caught tailwinds from decent data (today, PPI core was firm, housing starts not as bad as feared, building permits rose by more than expected; all this comes after a decent CPI report last week, and a massive beat for the NY Fed manufacturing gauge earlier in the week; additionally, the recent ISM manufacturing data and payrolls data were solid). It provided traders with Goldilocks conditions for equities to extend record highs, some desks said. Naturally, there are uncertainties that remain, as the Fed minutes noted (the minutes themselves were generally in line with expectations, revealing little new info), such as the exact impact of the coronavirus, and the uncertainty presented by US elections (Democrat debate tonight); however, these factors have not been strong enough to shake the narrative, particularly as more desks talk about a V-shape recovery from the virus, while Michael Bloomberg has recently surged in Democrat polls (he is considered a market-friendly candidate, when compared to the other Democrat hopefuls).</p><p><strong>* FOMC MINUTES:</strong> The FOMC’s January meeting minutes were in line with expectations, and the market’s reaction was muted. Members saw distribution of risks to economic activity as “somewhat more favourable” than at the prior meeting, current stance of policy likely to remain appropriate “for a time” providing information remains broadly consistent with outlook. Economic growth expected to continue at a “moderate pace”. Policymakers cited easing of trade tensions, receding Brexit risks and stabilising global growth as reducing downside risks but also generally expected trade uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated. There was nothing revealed about the Fed potentially tapering its bond buys in Q2. Market commentator Mohamed El-Erian said that given the coronavirus spillover risk, the minutes have shed little light on future rate/balance sheet policies other than to confirm that the higher risk to the outlook and the bias to ease “More notable,” El-Erian said, “the FOMC discussing pockets of excessive indebtedness/leverage/risk-taking.”</p><p><strong>* FEDSPEAK:</strong> Fed’s Bostic (non-voter) and Mester (voter, hawk) had little to say in terms of policy remarks. Fed's Kashkari (voter, dove) however, believes the Fed will likely stand pat for the three-to-six months, and the next move would likely be a cut, but if there were a positive shock, hikes could be called for. When asked about the impact of the coronavirus, he noted all the data he sees from China is viewed with a sceptical eye; adding it is unlikely that the US would be immune from a virus-related slowdown. Fed’s Harker (voter) is scheduled on the calendar at 21:30 GMT / 16:30 ET.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW - DEMOCRAT DEBATE:</strong> Six Democrat Presidential nominee hopefuls will debate for two-hours in Nevada tonight (the ninth edition) at 9pm ET, and will likely be a tense affair, with five of the candidates expected to target Michael Bloomberg (a centrist candidate and ex-GOP), who has recently qualified for the debates. Traders will be watching Bloomberg's performance ahead of Super Tuesday on 3rd March, when his name will for the first time appear on the ballot. An average of recent polls puts Sanders in the lead (around 29%), followed by Biden (18%) and then Bloomberg (16%); Bloomberg's recent surge has been to the detriment of Warren (12%) and Buttigieg (10%) while Klobuchar has also fallen (7%). In terms of the potential candidate’s performance against US President Trump at the November elections, polling is sending mixed messages. UBS has suggested that there are some issues that Sanders' opponents could exploit: according to polls, the most unpopular candidate qualities in a general election are being a socialist, being older than 75 years of age and having a heart attack in the past year; meanwhile, UBS also notes a poll which suggests US President Trump's approval rating is at an all-time high at 47%, according to NBC/WSJ, while 50% disapprove.</p><p><strong>* US HOUSING STARTS:</strong> US housing starts fell to a rate of 1.567mln from 1.626mln (revised), which was a touch better than expected (exp. 1.425mln), while building permits rose more than expected, to 1.551mln from 1.45mln (exp. 1.45mln). Oxford Economics noted that starts only pared the weather-induced surge, and that the underlying data still point to solid momentum going forward; OxEco reckons housing will make a small positive contribution to GDP growth in Q1. Meanwhile, building permits, which OxEco says is a better gauge of forward momentum, rose 9.2%, with single-family permits rising to their highest level since June 2007.</p><p><strong>* CANADA INFLATION:</strong> Headline inflation was firmer than expected, at 2.4% Y/Y (rising from 2.2%, against an estimated 2.3%), bringing annualised price growth to the highest rate since mid-2018. With that said, an average of the three BOC core measures dipped to 2.03% Y/Y from 2.1%, pretty much at the BOC's 2% target. Canadian bank RBC notes that on-target inflation was one of the key reasons the BOC stood pat in 2019 while other central banks like the Fed and ECB were lowering rates. \"But while core inflation remains on the mark (and headline even firmer), the story has changed,\" RBC writes, \"slower growth over the second half of last year means, in the BOC's view, the economy is now operating with some slack,\" and 2% core CPI is backward-looking, reflecting the economy previously running close to full capacity. RBC says it does not see the current levels of inflation hindering the BOC from cutting rates; indeed, money markets price 28bps of easing by the end of the year (with the first cut being fully priced for October). RBC sees the BOC reducing rates in April.</p><p><strong>* G20:</strong> Finance leaders (who meet on 22-23rd February) are expected to say global economic growth will pick-up modestly in 2020 and 2021, according to a draft communique, and note that there are signs that trade tensions are easing. Leaders are also expected to note the downside risks presented to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak. The statement will say monetary authorities should continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability and will likely reaffirm commitments to not devalue exchange rates for competitive purposes. Meanwhile, German finance minister Scholz expects G20 to make progress on global minimum tax level for companies, and new tax rules for tech giants.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP – PBOC LPR DECISION:</strong> In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese policymakers have implemented a slew of measures in an attempt to cushion the economy from and virus-related hit to Chinese GDP. However, a senior member of a Chinese government thinktank has still warned of a 1ppt impact on the 2020 metric, which could take growth to 5.0% from the 6.1% printed in 2019. Earlier this month, PBoC adviser Ma Jun said that the possibility of Loan Prime Rate cut on February 20th had significantly increased, adding that RRR cut should alleviate the shock to the real economy from the virus outbreak especially small and micro firms. The anticipated reduction comes after the PBoC unexpectedly cut some key short-term money market interest rates. Last week, the Chinese Central Bank reassured markets that it would use tools such as targeted RRR cuts, re-lending and rediscount to support sectors. Further, the PBoC has asked banks to cap loans for selected firms at 3.15%, which is 1ppts below the 1yr LPR – some have used this as a stencil as to what could be expected from the LPR announcement.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP - ECB MINUTES: </strong>The ECB maintained policy settings at its recent confab, and reiterated forward guidance. President Lagarde noted that incoming data was in line with the baseline scenario of ongoing but moderate growth, and also noted that data points have seen some stabilisation (vs. prev. remarks of “some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown”), before reiterating that “risks remain tilted to the downside but are less pronounced”. Lagarde was asked if there was discussion on changing the GC’s assessment to a more “balanced” view, to which she noted that there is “always” a discussion on the balance of risks, without giving details; any specifics on this will be a source of focus for the minutes. Some attention was placed on commentary stating that underlying inflation, while low, has stabilised, or “ticked up slightly”. However, inferences on how exactly the ECB will interpret fluctuations in inflation rates have been somewhat clouded by the upcoming strategic review; Lagarde took a circumspect approach on this theme, rebuffing specific questions, not wanting to have her viewpoints sway the focus of the review; a move likely dictated by her aim to impose a more harmonious approach to the decision-making process. Lagarde expects to announce the findings of the review late 2020. From a rates perspective, the President was quizzed on how the GC assesses the impact of negative rates, to which she stated that she was “concerned” about low rates; however, she was careful to qualify this statement by noting that low rates are predicated on low growth, and therefore, she would favour higher rates as that would be more indicative of higher growth. Overall, markets were presented with little in the way of new information for the future path of monetary policy at the Bank and the same is expected for the minutes.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.5% 3386, NDX +0.9% at 9719, DJ +0.4% at 29,348; Sectors: Energy +1.3%, IT +1.1%, Financials +0.7%, Consumer discretionary +0.5%, Health Care +0.5%, Communications +0.4%, Telecoms +0.4%, Materials +0.2%, Industrials -0.1%, Consumer staples -0.1%, utilities -1.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCKS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) and the tech sector rebounded from the prior day’s losses induced by the iPhone maker warning on revenues, semiconductors (SOX) also rebounded today. Analog Devices (ADI) led gains in the SOX space after its earnings report which beat on EPS, where it also increased its dividend. Nvidia (NVDA) also performed well following an upgrade at Bernstein, which highlighted the upcoming analyst day on March 19th and the Mellanox (MLNX) acquisition being completed as potential upside catalysts for the name. Tesla (TSLA) saw another stellar day following yet another PT upgrade for the automaker; Piper Sandler raised its PT to USD 928 citing potential success in its batteries and solar business could be the fuel to the next rally. American Airlines (AAL) pushed back its expected 737 MAX return to service to August 10th from June 4th, whilst also noting it expects continued discussions in terms of compensation from Boeing (BA) as it continues to take a hit this year. Nike (NKE) had an executive shake up where Andy Campion will be COO (currently EVP and CFO) and Matthew Friend (currently CFO of operating segments and VP of Investor relations) will be CFO from April 1st. Smiledirect Club (SDC) were slammed during hours after reports its top dentist may have its California license revoked.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> E&amp;P names Concho (CXO) and Devon (DVN) both hiked dividends; both saw solid gains, but were also likely supported on firmer crude prices. Garmin (GRMN) surged following top and bottom line beats, which also lifted its European counterpart Tom Tom (TOM2 NA).</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 1.20 HIGHER AT USD 53.49; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 1.37 HIGHER AT USD 59.12.</strong> The crude complex continued its rebound-on Wednesday, with multiple catalysts driving price action – the main being easing fears around coronavirus. Elsewhere, reports from Libya late Tuesday reignited some supply concerns, as cease-fire talks between the UN backed government and Haftar rebels collapsed. The latest NOC update saw Libya production around 123k BPD, falling from the prior days’ 135k. The crude complex tracked gains in equities amid broader risk appetite which saw SPX print fresh record highs as it rebounded from prior day Apple (AAPL) induced sell off. The rebound in prices saw the Brent backwardation continue to widen, with the front-month spread around USD 0.35, and three-month now at around USD ~0.50, adding to the bullish catalysts among the crude space. On OPEC, we are yet to see an official confirmation from Russia on their position for an emergency meeting, although today OPEC officials officially sent out the invitations for the originally planned March 5th-6th meeting. After the bell, energy inventory data will be on tap, with the street expecting headline crude stocks to show +2.5mln build, Gasoline +0.4mln build, Distillates -1.5mln draw.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 4 TICKS LOWER AT 131-02+:</strong> US yields were a touch higher on Wednesday by between (0.6bps to 2bps across the curve), though the shape of the curve bear-flattened (again modestly, to the tune of between 0.4bps to 2bps across major curve spreads. Risk sentiment notably improved on hopes of China stimulus, while the coronavirus narrative now seems to be coalescing on the notion of a V-shaped recovery; the US data docket has also been supportive, adding to the argument that the expansion can continue. There was very little immediate reaction after the FOMC meeting minutes were published, and Fedspeak continues to toe the line, with the central bank in monitoring mode.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The Dollar Index rose to the highest since May 2017, largely on the back of outflows from safe-haven FX (CHF and JPY, more notably the latter). CNH remains above 7.00 after the PBOC guided the USDCNY fix to above that figure for the first time since 25th December. The EUR continues its recent slide, with technicians noting the single currency has printed lower lows for the thirteenth straight day, the longest streak since 2015. The JPY hit a nine-month low against the dollar as the daily coronavirus case count slows and hopes of more stimulus out of China help buoy risk appetite, seeing USDJPY top 1.11. Gold, however, did not want to succumb to the haven weakness, and printed multi year highs after crossing USD 1,611.42 in late trade. However, the precious metal saw downside as US yields rose after decent housing data. Sterling is softer despite inflation firming by more than expected, as the USD strength and tense Brexit negotiations capture trader's attention, bringing cable to 1.2925 level. Mixed Canadian inflation data (headline up, core metrics down) was ultimately shrugged off, with participants taking their cues from the crude complex, where prices have continued to rebound from lows seen around 10th Feb; crude moves has also supported other commodity FX (namely, the RUB and NOK). EMFX was mixed, starting off on the front foot, but also fell victim to the aforementioned USD strength.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> With the EUR sliding to multi-year lows, inevitable questions about when it becomes attractive from a valuation standpoint have been asked. Citi does not think the EUR is cheap yet, and like many others expects the downside to persist. The bank argues that, on its valuation metrics, the EUR is only slightly undervalued against G10 FX, and is still not particularly weak in trade-weighted terms. Citi also thinks that markets are still pricing a sizable expected rebound in the key Eurozone PMIs (due Friday), arguing that while it would not chase the EUR sell-off this week, it still sees further EUR downside over time, with flows and positioning data also providing support (it thinks EUR shorts can extend).</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Inflation surprised to the upside, with the headline rising to 1.8% Y/Y (from 1.3% and an expected 1.6%); the core measure also rose (to 1.6% from 1.4%, against an expected 1.5%). Goods inflation drove prices higher in January (to 1.3% Y/Y from 0.6%), largely on the back of energy price rises. Services inflation, which analysts say is a better gauge of domestic inflation factors, picked up more modestly (to 2.3% from 2.1%). While inflation rose for the first time in six months, the prints are in line with BOE forecasts, and as such, will do little to change the MPC's dial -- if anything, however, some analysts believe they might reduce the chances that the Committee cuts rates in the near-term.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Wage price data for Q4 released overnight showed Aussie wages continue to hold steady (and sluggish), though the metrics were in line with RBA forecasts. And in the upcoming session, the jobs report will be in focus with analysts eying whether the data vindicates the RBA's 'stand pat' approach in the face of current and future downside risks. The consensus view expects the jobless rate to tick up by one-tenth to 5.2%, but it wouldn't be too much of a surprise if this nudged up further still (coronavirus and bushfires are the obvious factors, though Aussie data had been softening since before then, though the survey period may not entirely reflect the corona fallout just yet -- S&amp;P has warned of a material shock to the Aussie economy from coronavirus). ING notes that with Governor Lowe citing the advancements in the labour market as a key factor in the RBA policy equation, the rise in unemployment may revamp expectations for a more imminent cut than what market is currently pricing.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Inflation rose to a 7-month high at 4.5% Y/Y (previous 4.0%), bringing USDZAR back under 15.00. With headline inflation back to the SARB's 3-6% midpoint (it has been below this mid-point for over a year), analysts have argued that the prospects of the central bank following January's 25bps rate cut with another lowering of rates in March has diminished. Much, of course, depends on next week's Budget (26/Feb - Citi thinks risks are tilted to the downside for ZAR), and the subsequent rating review by Moody's next month (the only CRA which holds an IG rating on South Africa - a downgrade would likely trigger flows out of ZAR assets).</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> The CBRT cut rates by 50bps to 10.75%, in line with the consensus. Ahead of the confab, some speculated whether the cut would take place at all, and also the magnitude, with some expecting a deeper cut. Calls for an unchanged decision were based on the economic landscape in Turkey, where inflation is continuing to move higher which, alongside the lira's ongoing depreciation, does not support its persistent easing. But in spite of the domestic situation, the CBRT once again succumbed to President Erdogan's demand to get rates into single digits. Ultimately, the CBRT opted for a more measured cut, given the inflation outlook, which some analysts said may potentially imply cuts of a smaller magnitude (or even rates left on hold) ahead, assuming price pressures persist. The meeting itself drew relatively little reaction, however, the TRY did see some marginal downside, perhaps in part due to some participants expecting an unchanged outcome. Looking ahead, analysts note that, as meetings are monthly this year, there will be ample opportunity for the central bank to achieve single digit rates in smaller moves, which might help to mitigate damage to the TRY and inflation.</p><p><strong>* SEK:</strong> Inflation surprised to the downside, a development which may test the Riksbank's will to stand pat on rates in the weeks and months ahead, analysts said, particularly if subdued growth continues to keep a lid on inflation. In wake of the data, UBS said the path of least resistance was for the market to price some more Riksbank cuts in the front-end.</p>",

Elsewhere, reports from Libya late Tuesday reignited some supply concerns, as cease-fire talks between the UN backed government and Haftar rebels collapsed. The latest NOC update saw Libya production around 123k BPD, falling from the prior days’ 135k. The crude complex tracked gains in equities amid broader risk appetite which saw SPX print fresh record highs as it rebounded from prior day Apple (AAPL) induced sell off. The rebound in prices saw the Brent backwardation continue to widen, with the front-month spread around USD 0.35, and three-month now at around USD ~0.50, adding to the bullish catalysts among the crude space. On OPEC, we are yet to see an official confirmation from Russia on their position for an emergency meeting, although today OPEC officials officially sent out the invitations for the originally planned March 5th-6th meeting. After the bell, energy inventory data will be on tap, with the street expecting headline crude stocks to show +2.5mln build, Gasoline +0.4mln build, Distillates -1.5mln draw.</p>",

The Fed is monitoring the impact of the coronavirus, and there will be a great deal of attention on any commentary around this theme, given tech-giant Apple recently cut guidance due to the outbreak; the Fed is likely to reiterate that it would need a substantial shift from its baseline for it to tweak policy settings. Additionally, traders will be eyeing any commentary that gives insights into the course for the Fed’s repo operations, as well as any commentary on the upcoming policy review. Minutes will be released at 1900 GMT/1400 ET on 19th February 2020.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> has just surpassed last year’s high amidst widespread Dollar gains vs major and EM rivals, bar a very select or almost exclusive few. The index reached 99.702 vs 99.667 before pausing for breath in wake of better than expected US housing starts and building permits that added more impetus to the Greenback’s bull run, with attention now turning towards remaining Fed speakers and the FOMC minutes from January’s policy meeting. However, these may all prove to be irrelevant or only transient interruptions in the grand scheme of broad Buck strength and the overall upside trend ahead of the next line of resistance protecting 100.00, at 99.888.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The major loser and marked underperformer, as Usd/Jpy breached its previous ytd peak circa 110.29, then 110.50 and a Fib in close proximity before taking on 110.75 and now probing above 111.00 amidst a return to risk-on sentiment and with the Yen bearing the brunt of the unwinding of safe-haven flows. Moreover, stops were tripped through various levels and as the technical backdrop became increasingly destructive momentum appeared to take over, while market contacts also reported Japanese buying of <strong>GOLD </strong>as a hedge vs Jpy weakness, negative real yields and a bottom drawer trade/base position in case global equities and risk appetite turns sour at some stage. Indeed, Usd/Xau got to within a few cents of the 8th January 2019 multi-year apex before fading on the aforementioned overwhelming, albeit not quite all consuming Dollar appreciation.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD/SEK/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All unable to escape the Usd’s clutches, and Sterling’s demise came despite firmer than forecast UK inflation data, with Cable failing to sustain recovery gains on the 1.3000 handle and now looking more likely to lose grip of 1.2900. Similarly, the Aussie and Kiwi could not retain 0.6700+ and 0.6400+ status even though the latter received some encouragement from RBNZ Governor Orr overnight (NZ economy and monetary policy in a good spot), as the focus switches to NZ inflation and Aussie jobs data.

        "content": "<p><strong>ZAR/GBP/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Inflation metrics have given the Rand, Pound and Swedish Crown something else to consider aside from the broader fluctuations in risk sentiment largely on unfolding events in China and the external impact of COVID-19. Usd/Zar is consolidating around 14.9500 in wake of headline SA CPI rebounding towards the SARB’s 2020 average rate, while Cable pared declines from another test of decent sub-1.3000 support on the back of UK headline and core rates (y/y) both beating consensus, in stark contrast to Swedish readings falling far short of expectations and even recently downgraded Riksbank projections. Hence, Eur/Sek is hovering just shy of resistance circa 10.6000 and diverging from Eur/Nok that is back down around 10.0300 amidst a pick-up in risk appetite on more speculation about additional Chinese stimulus. Back to Sterling, fresh lows now being forged on a lack of follow-through buying and persistent jitters about a hard Brexit given little sign of the EU budging from level playing field lines.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not quite zero to hero, but the Kiwi has pared more losses from Tuesday’s lows following supportive comments from RBNZ Governor Orr overnight claiming that the domestic economy and OCR rate are both in a good place presently. Nzd/Usd has rebounded to 0.6400 in response, but Aud/Nzd remains above 1.0450 as the Aussie gleans traction from the <strong>YUAN</strong> reclaiming 7.0000+ status (just) after a first PBoC fix under the handle since Xmas Day. Indeed, Aud/Usd is straddling 0.6700 where a mega 2.6 bn expiries roll off compared to yesterday’s 0.6674 base and awaiting jobs data for more independent direction, while NZ Q4 CPI also looms for the Kiwi. Prior to all that, the Loonie will be looking for impetus via Canadian inflation as Usd/Cad retreats from post-manufacturing sales peaks close to 1.3280 and hovers near 1.3230.</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>The Yen has succumbed to more pronounced safe-haven flow/position unwinding, as Gold appears to be the port of choice and store of value most avidly sought at the current juncture. As such, Usd/Jpy has breached the prior ytd apex and is now aiming for 110.50 in front of a Fib (110.64), while spot bullion inches further beyond Usd1600/oz and to within a whisker of the January 8 pinnacle (Usd1611.42).</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Both narrowly mixed against a firmer Dollar in general, with the <strong>DXY</strong> inching closer to 99.500 in advance of US data and FOMC minutes amidst a raft of Fed speakers, and by definition displaying relative resilience. The single currency is pivoting 1.0800 with underlying support in the form of decent expiry interest at 1.0785 (1.2 bn), while the Franc continues to meander between 0.9800-50 and 1.0600-50 vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira is still languishing below 6.0000 vs the Greenback in wake of the latest more measured CBRT rate cuts (-50 bp) and a reiteration of cautious guidance for further easing given recent spikes in inflation and above forecast Turkish CPI prints. Moreover, on top of his usual pre-policy meeting prompting for further rate normalisation (easing) President Erdogan upped the ante vs Russia and Syrian Government forces with a warning that attacks in Idlib will not be tolerated.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: CBRT Rate Decision 11:00GMT. Exp. 10.75% vs. Prev. 11.25%",
        "content": "<p><strong>Overall</strong></p><ul><li>CBRT is expected to cut rates by 50bps to 10.75% vs. Prev. 11.25%; although, the Reuters survey is not unanimous with 5/15 respondents calling for rates to be left unchanged. In terms of the calls for a cut, consensus is for 50bp; however, one of the respondents is calling for a 75bp cut to 10.50%. Calls for a rate cut are supported by the ongoing easing path of the CBRT as well as recent communication being perceived as dovish, with the Bank’s 2020 forecast seeing the repo rate at 9.63%. However, in support of an unchanged meeting are the strong domestic data prints, particularly CPI, alongside the ongoing TRY depreciation; note, it is worth caveating that a similar argument for rates being left unchanged was portrayed by some desks at the January meeting.</li></ul><p><strong>Previous Meeting</strong></p><ul><li>In January the CBRT cuts rates slightly more than market consensus to 11.25% from 12.0% (consensus 11.5%) and noted that current monetary policy stance is consistent with their projected disinflation path. Looking ahead, they noted that the extend of policy tightness will be determined via looking at indications around the underlying inflation trend. There was some focus on remarks concerning inflation as the Bank judges it to be broadly in-line with end of 2020 projections, which is in contrast to December’s statement that inflation is likely to materialise close to the lower bound of the October inflation projections. The meeting prompted some mild TRY strength given that, in-line with their history of exceeding expectations, some participants were looking for an even deeper cut.</li></ul><p><strong>Data</strong></p><ul><li>Since the January decision, the most pertinent data print has been January’s inflation which exceeded market expectations at 12.15% vs. Exp. 11.86% YY. The driving forces behind this uptick was predominantly food and cost price pressures, which came in-spite of the Governments move to cancel tobacco and alcohol tax increases. On inflation, HSBC note that the January print as well as higher inflation expectations are part of their call for rates to be left unchanged this time around. Recall, prior to the last meeting there was some speculation that prices as well as the TRY’s decline, which has continued, would be sufficient to prompt an unchanged decision; an argument which still stands at this meeting. Other prints data points have been firmer with January’s Manufacturing PMI moving into expansionary territory at 51.3 vs. Prev. 49.5 with the less timely industrial production for December beating expectations. Finally, the current account balance also came in better than expected for January.</li></ul><p><strong>CBRT Commentary</strong></p><ul><li>Governor Uysal has remarked that a period of fine-tuning policy has now begun, and the next step in this will be to become data dependent as well as noting that inflation is expected to converge gradually to the target rate, and their current prudential stance is in-line with inflation targets. A recent CBRT survey also noted that the repo rate in 2020 is seen at 9.63%; which is in-line with the well reiterated stance from Turkish President Erdogan that he wants the rate in single digit territory. Overall, HSBC surmise the recent commentary out of the CBRT as being dovish and as such, in-contrast to their call for an unchanged meeting, accept that risks are tilted towards a 50bp cut.</li></ul><p><strong>TRY</strong></p><ul><li>The Lira continues to depreciate as geopolitical headline risk, largely from Syria but most recently the re-flaring of Russia/Ukraine tensions, remains the driving force for the Lira. On the Lira, Governor Uysal has remarked that the Bank does not have an exchange rate target. Since the last meeting the Lira has significantly depreciated vs. USD, with USD/TRY surpassing the 6.0 level to the upside on the aforementioned geopolitical tensions compared to the circa 5.90 handle at the previous meeting; adding some further emphasis to the calls for rates to be left unchanged this time around, particularly as this move has occurred in-spite of capital control measures being utilised.</li></ul>",

The change in direction/sentiment began when Wall Street returned from the long holiday weekend and continued somewhat selectively overnight amidst more reports about China rolling out fiscal stimulus to help combat the economic damage caused by the coronavirus, while the number of confirmed cases and fatalities continue to taper. Ahead, only Eurozone current account data before relatively small long end German supply and a lively pm agenda culminating in FOMC minutes.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equities trade with cautious gains following on from a mixed lead on Wall Street, where the Dow fell for a third consecutive day following Apple’s profit warning, albeit Nasdaq ended the session relatively flat. ASX 200 (+0.1) traded flat throughout most of the session thus far and failed to gain much traction from a slew of earnings, although heavyweight Westpac’s shares are pressured amid additional costs expected to be incurred due to its regulatory investigation. Nikkei 225 (0.3%) eke mild gains following the prior session’s steep losses with the index underpinned by a slightly softer JPY, meanwhile Nissan shares lead the gains despite its alliance partner Renault’s downgrade to junk status at Moody’s. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.1%) pared opening losses with the former supported by its behemoth oil stocks and financials (ex-HSBC), whilst the latter sees support ahead of tomorrow’s LRP announcement, which is widely be reduced following the 10bps MLF cut by the PBoC earlier in the week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In FX, DXY hovers near the prior day’s high as the index remains in close proximity to 99.50 to the upside ahead of the FOMC minutes release later today, and with little by way of news flow overnight to influence price action. EUR/USD trades little changed and remains around 1.0800, with the pair holding onto a bulk of the prior session’s losses, whilst GBP/USD trades on either side of 1.3000 – with the pair seeing its 200WMA ~1.3030 and 100WMA just above 1.2950. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses trade with little conviction throughout the session thus far, with the former breaching resistance at 109.95 ahead of the psychological 110 mark. Elsewhere, CNH experience some weakness as the PBoC set its Yuan reference rate above 7.0000, marking the weakest fix since Christmas Day last year. USD/CNH took out its 100 DMA ~7.009 to a high of just shy of 7.0200. Finally, NZD/USD remains supported amid comments from RBNZ Governor Orr - who stated that the NZ economy and current RBNZ monetary policy are in a good place. AUD/USD meanwhile trades little changed intraday, having largely side-lined Wage Price data ahead of the Labour Force report tomorrow, although the Aussie lost some ground following the weaker PBoC fixing.</p>",
