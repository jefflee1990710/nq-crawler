The complex settled off highs, which newswires attributed to talks between the US and China nearing their deadline (on 1 March). US T-note futures (H9) settled 5+ ticks higher at 122-07.</p>\r\n",

Williams sees Fed drawing down balance sheet for some time; EU&rsquo;s Juncker against US auto-tariffs; NAHB beats estimate, UK PM May to present EU with new legal arguments.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AHEAD: Australian Wage Index, EZ Consumer Confidence, FOMC Minutes, ECB&rsquo;s Praet Speaking, Riksbank&rsquo;s Floden Speaking, Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan, Bullard &amp; Daly Speaking, UK PM May meeting EU Commission President Juncker, German 2024 Bobl auction, Earnings from Edison, Fresenius SE, Fresenius Medical, Iberdrola, Lloyds, Glencore.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>President Trump said the talks were going well, but were complex and that the March 1st deadline is not a &ldquo;magical date&rdquo;; he added that China was making efforts to speed up the talks in order to avoid tariff increases. Earlier, reports had suggested that the US was said to be pushing for a stable yuan currency, that if not complied with then tariffs will be considered. On the European side of things, EU-US tensions have been elevated in recent days as it was announced the US is considering fresh tariffs on imported auto vehicles. EU Commission President Juncker Monday said that if implemented, the EU would break its promise to import more soy and LNG from the US. Juncker spoke on the matter again on Tuesday saying he &ldquo;hopes&rdquo; that US President Trump avoids any auto-tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (voter) sees reserves on the balance sheet falling to $1trln or somewhat more, from around $1.6trln; added that he expects the Fed to be drawing down balance sheet for some time. Ahead of the Fed&#39;s meeting minutes, released Wednesday 1400 eastern time/1900 GMT, Fed&#39;s Mester (non-voter, hawk) said she&#39;d be comfortable in slowing the pace of the balance sheet run-off, and would be comfortable ending it before the end of the year, arguing that there&#39;d be little material impact on the economy. On rates, she suggested that the FFR target may need to move a &#39;bit higher&#39; if the economy performs in line with her expectations. Regarding tomorrow&#39;s meeting minutes, the Fed made dovish tweaks at its January meeting. With the FOMC in data-dependent mode, discussion on the balance of risks will be key; additionally, markets will be keeping an eye out for any clues that there is a consensus on the FOMC to halt its balance sheet run-off this year.

However, UK PM May spokesperson later said that he wouldn&rsquo;t classify the compromise as &ldquo;dead&rdquo;, with Brexit Minister Steve Barclay saying it will be used as part of future relationship discussions with the EU; Barclay also confirmed that the UK will bring legally binding proposals, which Attorney General Cox has prepared, to the EU (which could be presented this week). On the EU front, Commission President Juncker said he expects &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; talks with UK PM May on Wednesday and that the question of a no-deal Brexit lies in the UK&rsquo;s hands, which EU officials reportedly see a 60% probability of; this comes after earlier reports from the Commission that the EU 27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement and would not accept a time-limit on the key Irish backstop issue. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAHB: </strong>Homebuilder confidence came in at 62 in February, above the consensus view of 59 (against a prior 58). The reading is the second increase in 2019, helping to ease concerns over the degree of the slowdown in residential activity. Lower rates have clearly played a part in improving sentiment. &quot;While structural affordability challenges remain, the 50bps decline in mortgages rates over the past two months, robust job growth and stabilizing consumer confidence should buoy demand during the spring buying season,&quot; Wells Fargo said. PHG, LEN, DHI and the XHB ticked higher on the release of the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) FUTURES SETTLE $0.47 HIGHER AT $56.45; BRENT (J9) SETTLES $0.05 LOWER AT $66.45/BBL. </strong>Oil prices have broken their recent winning streak on Tuesday, all in the backdrop of a weaker US dollar, the waiting of further updates on US-China trade talks as well as a softer US equity market. Analysts at Citi note that RBOB gasoline, what some have attributed as a leading indicator for the crude complex, has pared back on some of its gains from last week&rsquo;s reports of an unplanned outage of a cracker at Bayway refinery, New Jersey, &ldquo;a key source of supply to the New York Harbour delivery point.&rdquo; Elsewhere, EIA forecasts US total shale regions oil production for March seen up by 84k BPD at 8.397mln BPD (vs. 89k BPD rise in Feb). It is worth noting that &ndash; due to the US holiday on Monday - the weekly APIs have been delayed till Wednesday and the DOEs will now be released on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.2% at 2780, NDX +0.2% at 7067, DJI +0.0% at 25893. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.3%, Materials +0.6%, Industrials -0.1%, Cons Discretionary +0.5%, Cons Staples +0.5%, Healthcare -0.3%, Financials +0.2%, Tech +0.0%, Telecoms +0.3%, Utilities +0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Earnings from Walmart (WMT), which showed a beat on revenue and comparable sales estimates, saw the stock surge on the open. Medtronic (MDT) beat top and bottom line estimates, whilst raising guidance, causing it to trade in the green on Tuesday. CenturyLink (CTL) outperformed after investor Southeastern Asset Management pushed the co. to consider asset sales and add new board members. Newmont Mining (NEM) drifted higher on the back of Canadian regulators approving its acquisition of Goldcorp. Copper names Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Southern Copper (SCCO) saw large gains after Citi upgraded the two stocks on a bullish copper outlook. Construction/engineering stocks Arconic (ARNC) and Jacobs Engineering (JEC) both opened higher after both announcing accelerated share repurchase programmes. Video-game developer Electronic Arts (EA) was an underperformer as investors digest the success of its new Apex Legends game, with reports of the co. already banning 60,000 users for cheating and some Wall Street analysts sceptical; competitor Activision Blizzard (ATVI) also underperformed. Toymaker Mattel (MAT) continued falling as markets reopened today following it providing a weaker sales outlook for 2019 on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 5+ TICKS HIGHER AT 122-07. </strong>Yields were down by 0.5-2.4bps across the curve, with steepening in the belly being seen ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC minutes, which are expected to continue the dovish rhetoric seen out of the central bank in 2019. The complex settled off highs, which newswires attributed to talks between the US and China nearing their deadline (on 1 March).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable has extended its recovery gains above 1.2900, through yesterday&rsquo;s high and beyond technical resistance in the form of the 30 DMA circa 1.2949 to around 1.3000, eclipsing early February peaks along with the 21 DMA (1.2989). Aside from another solid snapshot of the UK jobs market, overall, the Pound has managed to overlook more EU intransigence on the WA ahead of the next set of meetings between key Brexit negotiators, and may have been encouraged by reports from Downing Street expressing pleasant surprise about how well talks in Brussels went on Monday, and suggesting frenzied activity behind the scenes. Others point to Sterling simply being undervalued, and Eur/Gbp retraced towards 0.8700 from just over 0.8762 to support the theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK: </strong>Off worst levels, but still on course to end Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session near multi-month lows and the biggest G10 loser by some distance after Eur/Sek soaked up offers at 10.6000 and 10.6100 on the way to 10.6200 at one stage. The catalyst, weaker than forecast Swedish inflation and even worse housing starts that undermine the Riksbank&rsquo;s relative optimism about the domestic economy that in turn kept guidance for another repo hike in H2 this year intact at February&rsquo;s policy meeting. The cross has eased back under 10.6000 ahead of a speech by Governor Ingves at 17.30GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another major underperformer as oil prices pulled up close to ytd highs and broader risk appetite waned, with the Loonie back under 1.3250 and approaching 1.3300 before paring some losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, EUR: </strong>Both benefiting from the latest Dollar downturn and DXY rejection of 97.000+, and the Franc inching further from recent lows circa 1.1000 towards parity again in wake of a relatively large increase in Switzerland&rsquo;s trade balance. Meanwhile, the single currency staged another impressive and firm rebound from sub-1.1300 territory in the face of more worrying data from Italy and dovish-sounding ECB commentary (de Guindos this time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, JPY: </strong>All emerging pretty flat vs the Greenback, but not before some volatile trade as the Kiwi regained some composure against its US and Aussie peers after feeling the knock-on effects of RBA minutes overnight. Nzd/Usd is back up around 0.6850, with Aud/Nzd down to 1.0400 vs 1.0430 or thereabouts at the high and Aud/Usd meandering between 0.7105-45 on the wide. To recap, the aforementioned RBA release reaffirmed neutral policy guidance, but also noted significant risks around the central or baseline outlook. Similarly, Usd/Jpy remained nearer the upper end of a 110.45-80 range after relatively downbeat/dovish BoJ commentary as Governor Kuroda said more easing may be needed if the Jpy appreciates too much and jeopardises growth or hinders progress towards reaching the 2% CPI goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Fears about political developments hitting the Real were somewhat unfounded as Usd/Brl only knee-jerked higher off the open before drifting down to almost 3.7100 from circa 3.7445. Note, a close aide to Bolsonaro was removed from office raising concerns over the President&rsquo;s planned pension reform bill.</p>\r\n",

It is worth noting that &ndash; due to the US holiday on Monday - the weekly APIs have been delayed till Wednesday and the DOEs will now be released on Thursday.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable has extended its recovery gains above 1.2900, through yesterday&rsquo;s high and beyond technical resistance in the form of the 30 DMA circa 1.2949 to around 1.3000, eclipsing early February peaks along with the 21 DMA (1.2989). Aside from another solid snapshot of the UK jobs market, overall, the Pound has managed to overlook more EU intransigence on the WA ahead of the next set of meetings between key Brexit negotiators, and may have been encouraged by reports from Downing Street expressing pleasant surprise about how well talks in Brussels went on Monday, and suggesting frenzied activity behind the scenes. Others point to Sterling simply being undervalued, and Eur/Gbp retraced towards 0.8700 from just over 0.8762 to support the theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off worst levels, but still on course to end Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session near multi-month lows and the biggest G10 loser by some distance after Eur/Sek soaked up offers at 10.6000 and 10.6100 on the way to 10.6200 at one stage. The catalyst, weaker than forecast Swedish inflation and even worse housing starts that undermine the Riksbank&rsquo;s relative optimism about the domestic economy that in turn kept guidance for another repo hike in H2 this year intact at February&rsquo;s policy meeting. The cross has eased back under 10.6000 ahead of a speech by Governor Ingves at 17.30GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major underperformer as oil prices pulled up close to ytd highs and broader risk appetite waned, with the Loonie back under 1.3250 and approaching 1.3300 before paring some losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both benefiting from the latest Dollar downturn and DXY rejection of 97.000+, and the Franc inching further from recent lows circa 1.1000 towards parity again in wake of a relatively large increase in Switzerland&rsquo;s trade balance. Meanwhile, the single currency staged another impressive and firm rebound from sub-1.1300 territory in the face of more worrying data from Italy and dovish-sounding ECB commentary (de Guindos this time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All emerging pretty flat vs the Greenback, but not before some volatile trade as the Kiwi regained some composure against its US and Aussie peers after feeling the knock-on effects of RBA minutes overnight. Nzd/Usd is back up around 0.6850, with Aud/Nzd down to 1.0400 vs 1.0430 or thereabouts at the high and Aud/Usd meandering between 0.7105-45 on the wide. To recap, the aforementioned RBA release reaffirmed neutral policy guidance, but also noted significant risks around the central or baseline outlook. Similarly, Usd/Jpy remained nearer the upper end of a 110.45-80 range after relatively downbeat/dovish BoJ commentary as Governor Kuroda said more easing may be needed if the Jpy appreciates too much and jeopardises growth or hinders progress towards reaching the 2% CPI goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fears about political developments hitting the Real were somewhat unfounded as Usd/Brl only knee-jerked higher off the open before drifting down to almost 3.7100 from circa 3.7445. Note, a close aide to Bolsonaro was removed from office raising concerns over the President&rsquo;s planned pension reform bill.</p>\r\n",

The FTSE 100 (-0.6%) is weighed on by poor performance in HSBC (-4.0%) following their earnings; the Dax (-0.2%) is outperforming its peers bolstered by Wirecard (+4.5%) and Heidelberg Cement (+3.4%) following Bafin prohibiting new/extending shorts yesterday and a Q4 revenue beat respectively. Sectors are broadly in the red, with some underperformance in banking names, weighed on by the aforementioned HSBC who carry around a 2% Stoxx 600 weighting; and are the largest banking component. Other notable movers include, Danone (-0.7%) who are in the red in-spite of a beat on their sales, with some analysts highlighting weaker than expected margins. Automakers, such as Volkswagen (-0.9%) and Daimler (-1.0%) are in negative territory after EU Commission President Juncker stating that US President Trump gave his word that there wouldn&rsquo;t be tariffs on European cars for the time being; alongside the EU agreeing to cut new truck CO2 emission levels by 30% before 2030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - The Swedish Crown has slumped in wake of much softer than expected inflation data, and a slump in housing starts that together raise valid question marks over the Riksbank&rsquo;s relatively confident outlook on the domestic economy and CPI/CPIF remaining close to target. On that note, Governor Ingves is due to speak later today and will get a chance to comment, as Eur/Sek spikes from sub-10.5000 through several chart resistance levels and only a whisker away from offers said to be lined up at 10.6000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Very volatile trade overnight on the back of latest RBA minutes that initially underpinned the Aud on confirmation of no likelihood of a change in policy rates for some time (so no ease in the offing), but then underlined the shift to a more neutral stance and highlighted significant risks to the economic outlook. Aud/Usd retreated swiftly in response and is currently holding just above 0.7100, while the Kiwi has been dragged down in sympathy as the cross remains just above 1.0400, with Nzd/Usd hovering around 0.6825 vs just a few pips short of 0.6900 on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - The next worst G10 performers, as Usd/Jpy grinds back up into a higher range and closer to 111.00 again amidst dovish rhetoric if not firm or official guidance from BoJ Governor Kuroda (mulling more accommodation if Jpy strength weighs on growth and hampers efforts to achieve the 2% inflation target, which has already proved extremely elusive of course). The headline pair is now probing 110.80, but could be held back by decent option expiry interest at 110.60 (1 bn). Meanwhile, the Loonie remains anchored around 1.3250 vs its US counterpart, eyeing crude to see whether prices push further ahead or consolidate around 2019 peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CHF - All narrowly mixed and pretty flat vs the Dollar that has edged up from yesterday&rsquo;s lows (DXY close to 97.000 at one stage), with Cable maintaining 1.2900+ status, albeit just, awaiting more Brexit developments/headlines following a solid if not quite as upbeat as forecast UK labour market report. Similarly, the single currency is clinging to 1.1300 and showing resilience in the face of yet more dire Italian data, perhaps drawing a degree of encouragement from a more mixed ZEW survey, while the Franc is still chipping away at recent losses and inching through 1.0050 after a wider Swiss trade surplus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - More depreciation for the likes of the Rand and Lira, but the pressure and spotlight may switch somewhat to the Real later given political jitters due to the dismissal of a key aide to President Bolsonaro and potential adverse repercussions for pension reform.

In stark contrast, 10 year BTP futures have recoiled from 128.34 at one stage to 127.27 before paring some lost ground as attention turned to the ZEW survey, which was mixed as sentiment beat expectations but current conditions fell short of consensus. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have inched up with their core EU peers, but incrementally awaiting the return of domestic market participants after Monday&rsquo;s Presidents Day holiday.

        "content": "<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Swedish Crown has slumped in wake of much softer than expected inflation data, and a slump in housing starts that together raise valid question marks over the Riksbank&rsquo;s relatively confident outlook on the domestic economy and CPI/CPIF remaining close to target. On that note, Governor Ingves is due to speak later today and will get a chance to comment, as Eur/Sek spikes from sub-10.5000 through several chart resistance levels and only a whisker away from offers said to be lined up at 10.6000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very volatile trade overnight on the back of latest RBA minutes that initially underpinned the Aud on confirmation of no likelihood of a change in policy rates for some time (so no ease in the offing), but then underlined the shift to a more neutral stance and highlighted significant risks to the economic outlook. Aud/Usd retreated swiftly in response and is currently holding just above 0.7100, while the Kiwi has been dragged down in sympathy as the cross remains just above 1.0400, with Nzd/Usd hovering around 0.6825 vs just a few pips short of 0.6900 on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst G10 performers, as Usd/Jpy grinds back up into a higher range and closer to 111.00 again amidst dovish rhetoric if not firm or official guidance from BoJ Governor Kuroda (mulling more accommodation if Jpy strength weighs on growth and hampers efforts to achieve the 2% inflation target, which has already proved extremely elusive of course). The headline pair is now probing 110.80, but could be held back by decent option expiry interest at 110.60 (1 bn). Meanwhile, the Loonie remains anchored around 1.3250 vs its US counterpart, eyeing crude to see whether prices push further ahead or consolidate around 2019 peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed and pretty flat vs the Dollar that has edged up from yesterday&rsquo;s lows (DXY close to 97.000 at one stage), with Cable maintaining 1.2900+ status, albeit just, awaiting more Brexit developments/headlines following a solid if not quite as upbeat as forecast UK labour market report. Similarly, the single currency is clinging to 1.1300 and showing resilience in the face of yet more dire Italian data, perhaps drawing a degree of encouragement from a more mixed ZEW survey, while the Franc is still chipping away at recent losses and inching through 1.0050 after a wider Swiss trade surplus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More depreciation for the likes of the Rand and Lira, but the pressure and spotlight may switch somewhat to the Real later given political jitters due to the dismissal of a key aide to President Bolsonaro and potential adverse repercussions for pension reform. For reference, Usd/Brl settled around 3.7330 on Monday.</p>\r\n",

The former is just off a 124.29 high, eyeing last Thursday&rsquo;s 124.49 intraday peak next, while its German equivalent reached 166.75 and only 8 ticks shy of its 166.83 contract pinnacle, as the corresponding 10 year yield trades in single digits again. In stark&nbsp;contrast, 10 year BTP futures have recoiled from 128.34 at one stage to 127.27 before paring some lost ground as attention turns to the ZEW survey. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have inched up with their core EU peers, but incrementally awaiting the return of domestic market participants after Monday&rsquo;s Presidents Day holiday. Note, no US data on the slate today, but a speech from Fed&rsquo;s Mester is due.</p>\r\n",

The impending EU cash bourse opens may provide more directional impetus ahead of February&rsquo;s ZEW survey that could be a pre-cursor for Thursday&rsquo;s flash PMIs and underscore dovish ECB leanings, if weak again. However, Bunds still look trapped from a chart/tech perspective, with a series of near term resistance levels from yesterday&rsquo;s session peak at 166.55 through to the 166.83 contract best, while the downside appears limited unless support around 166.28-26 is breached.</p>\r\n",

The main drivers on the downside are prices for clothing and footwear as well as for foreign travel&rdquo;. However, Nordea forecasts these prices to decline slightly less than normal due to the weak SEK boosting prices. Furthermore, the bank expects January CPIF ex energy at 1.8% y/y, up from 1.5% in December and 0.1% point above the Riksbank&rsquo;s call. Finally, analysts at Nordea highlight&nbsp;that the Swedish Central Bank is in no hurry to hike rates despite its optimistic view on inflation and growth, adding that they expect the Riksbank to be &ldquo;disappointed on most fronts later this year&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

Antipodeans were choppy with AUD/USD initially underpinned in a knee-jerk reaction to the RBA minutes which reiterated there is no strong case for a near-term move in rates and that it is better to be a source of stability, although the currency pared the gains shortly after as attention turned to the dovish tone by the board which saw significant uncertainties on the economic outlook and suggested a more evenly balanced view on rates.

ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with the index led higher by outperformance in the tech and financials sectors, although consumer staples and healthcare are on the other side of the spectrum after losses in Coles and Blackmores due to weak earnings, which saw shares in the latter decline around 30%. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) just about remains afloat with price action largely reflecting jittery trade in the domestic currency, while Hang Seng &nbsp;(+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) &nbsp;are composed as focus remains on US-China trade discussions which will resume today and with higher level talks involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and USTR Lighthizer set to begin on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action across currencies have mostly been muted amid a sparse calendar and following the North American closures which has kept the DXY subdued below the 97.00 level, while its major counterparts across the pond have fared no better with EUR/USD and GBP/USD testing 1.1300 and 1.2900 to the downside respectively. Elsewhere, antipodeans are choppy as AUD/USD initially gained in a knee-jerk reaction to the RBA minutes which reiterated there is no strong case for a near-term move in rates and that it is better to be a source of stability, although the currency pared the gains shortly after as attention turned to the dovish tone by the board which saw significant uncertainties on the economic outlook and suggested a more evenly balanced view on rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are softer following a pullback from the prior day&rsquo;s gains and with demand suppressed by the mild upside across stocks and ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
