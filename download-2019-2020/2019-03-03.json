Tesla (TSLA) opened lower after CEO Musk announced the co. would unlikely be profitable in Q1 and lowering its price on its pinnacle Model 3 vehicle. Foot Locker (FL) surged on the open by beating top and bottom line estimates and reporting 9.7% comparable sales; supplier Nike (NKE) also followed suit. Marriott International (MAR) opened lower following a disappointing revenue figure and lowering its guidance. eBay (EBAY) made gains after initiating strategic measures in tandem with activist investors Elliot and Starboard. Caesars (CZR) was an outperformer on the announcement of three new board members supported by investor Carl Icahn. Amazon (AMZN) announced plans to launch a new low cost grocery chain, supermarket stocks (WMT, KR, TGT,COST) dipped on the news. * SPX +0.7% at 2804, NDX +0.8% at 7151, DJI +0.4% at 26029.</p><p>T-Note were sold, and benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose around 5bps on the day, taking it to the key 2.75%. Much of the afternoon was categorised by rangebound price action, but in later trade the complex caught another wave of selling; many would have expected the T-Note to be bought after a bout of weak data out of the US, however, there may be a few factors explaining both the USD’s upside as well as the T-Note’s downside: firstly, the Fed is going nowhere anytime soon, with policy data-dependent and the central bank in wait and see mode, rates or the buck are not likely to garner much influence from monpol in absence of a new directional cue; second, as we have pointed out previously, a low FX vol environment (combined with rising stocks) can be a good backdrop for carry strategies (favouring the USD); and third, traders note that next week’s macro docket may see dovish updates from the ECB, possibly RBA and possibly even the BOC, which may end up favouring USD. * US T-Note futures (H9) settled 10 ticks lower at 121-14.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
