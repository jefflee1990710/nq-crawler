        "content": "<p><strong>FOMC</strong></p><p>Federal Reserve cut the Fed Funds Target by 25bps to 2.00%-2.25% as expected in which Fed’s George and Rosengren dissented. (Newswires)</p><p>The Fed said it will continue to monitor incoming information and maintained guidance to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, while it lowered IOER to 2.1% and said it will conclude the balance sheet normalisation process in August which is 2 months earlier than expected. The Fed also cited implications of global developments for the US outlook as well as muted inflation pressures and stated that spending growth has picked up but business fixed investment growth has been soft and inflation compensation measures remain low.</p><p>Fed's Chair Powell commented at the press conference that the outlook to the economy remains favourable and rate cut is to foster faster return to 2% inflation target, while he added that weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty and muted inflation has concerned the Fed. Powell added that the rate cut is a mid-cycle policy adjustment and that the current rate decision is different from the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle, while he answered increasing policy support this year has kept the economy on track when asked if a 25bps cut is sufficient to return inflation to target, but later added he did not say that today's cut is going to be the start of a cycle of \"just one\" rate cut.</p><p>Market reaction to the decision and statement was choppy as the 25bps was expected, while it maintained its language to ‘act as appropriate’ to sustain the expansion and pledged to continue monitoring incoming information in their decision making which was framed by analysts as a neutral cut since language has been maintained that the Fed can cut further if it needs to but there was not any explicit pledge to do so, while news that the balance sheet normalisation plan would end early was seen as dovish for the Treasury complex. However, Powell stated at the press conference that the move was a “mid-cycle adjustment” and that there was an ‘insurance’ aspect to the cut, while he also added that today’s rate decision was different to the start of a lengthy cutting cycle and continued to sound upbeat through the presser which triggered a hawkish reaction, although he later clarified that he had not said that the rate decision will be a cycle of ‘just one’ rate cut which raised the possibility of further insurance cuts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>There were initial reports that the first US-China trade discussions since May’s suspension ended early with no sign of a breakthrough but a willingness to continue discussions. However, reports later noted that US-China trade talks in Shanghai were said to be constructive, candid, efficient and involved deep exchanges over major issues of mutual interest. Furthermore, the sides discussed increasing the purchase of US agricultural goods and US creating good conditions for China's purchase of the farm products, while China and US trade negotiators are to meet in the US in September for further trade talks according to Chinese State Media. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times Editor tweeted that US and Chinese negotiators had an \"efficient and constructive deep exchange\" and discussed increasing purchase of US agricultural products whilst the US agreed to create favourable conditions for it, US and China trade talks will continue in the future, while he later tweeted that US and China will hold intensive working level discussions in August which shows that talks were not bad and that it is inaccurate to describe today's talks as ending bad.

Apple (AAPL) shot higher after the co. reported strong top and bottom-line earnings and decent gains in non-iPhone revenue vindicated the co.’s diversification efforts. China sales were also a bright spot. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell after the co. posted disappointing revenue guidance, despite profit and revenue for Q2 printing inline. Some important health care names reported; Amgen (AMGN) and Humana (HUM) advanced after both co.’s posted strong Q2 earnings and raised FY guidance. Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell, despite the co. beating on top and bottom lines, as revenue was guided slightly below street expectations. Electronic Arts (EA) and Garmin (GRMN) both shot higher after the companies posted strong top and bottom-line earnings and raised guidance. Desks also noted optimism regarding EA Apex Legends sales in FY20. Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP) sunk after the brewer missed on the top and bottom lines.&nbsp; Other notable stocks benefitting from decent earnings include; Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM), Allstate Corp (ALL), Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cincinnati Financial (CINF), Johnson Controls International (JCI), ONEOK (OKE), Hess Corporation (HES), Southwestern Energy Corp. (SWE), Moody's Corp (MCO). Notable stocks suffering on poor earnings; General Electric (GE), GrubHub (GRUB) and Dominion Energy (D). Elsewhere, Boeing (BA) stocks were pressured by damning premarket reports, which alleged an internal risk analysis after the first of the two Boeing (BA) 737 MAX airliner crashes showed the likelihood was high of a similar cockpit emergency within months. S&amp;P 500 -1.1% at 2980, NASDAQ-100 -1.3% at 7849, Dow Jones -1.2% at 26863.</p><p>The US treasury curve bull flattened with the 2s30s narrowing by around 10bp after the fed’s decision to trim rates by 25bp. The T complex saw a specifically bullish catalyst as the balance sheet tapering was to finish 2 months early with some analysts suggesting the fed could purchase up to USD 35-40bln of additional treasuries over the next 2 months. Looking through to the end of the year markets now price 35bp of easing (before the 25bp cut decision 68bp of easing was priced) as pricing becomes a bit more hawkish prior to the meeting. US T-note futures (U9) settled 2+ ticks higher at 127-13+.</p>",

This has been framed by analysts as a neutral cut, since language has been maintained that the Fed can cut further if it needs to, but there does not seem any explicit pledge to cut rates further. Additionally, the two dissenters have blunted the dovish impact, suggesting that the whole Committee is not certain about the policy path. The news that the balance sheet normalisation plan would end early, however, was dovish for the Treasury complex. Market reaction to the decision and statement was very choppy, and seems to have settled to around pre-announced levels (SPX 3013 vs 3015 before; T-Note 127-15 vs 127-18 before, DXY at 98.30 vs 98.09 before, and XAU at 1424 vs 1425 ahead of the decision). Analysts reasoned that the USD strengthened since the decision was more hawkish than the doves were hoping for (dissents, neutral cut), while other suggested that the cut to help support global growth was USD positive. In the press conference, Powell justified the rate cut in order to foster a quicker return to 2% inflation goal, and a slightly more accommodative stance that insures against downside and support the outlook. Powell said the move was a “mid-cycle adjustment” and that there was an ‘insurance’ aspect to the cut, to insure against the downside outlook from the weak global growth and trade tensions – Powell noted that trade uncertainty had been more elevated than anticipated; all contributing to the narrative of a ‘neutral’ cut. Powell also stated that today’s rate decision was different to the start of a lengthy cutting cycle. Powell continued to sound upbeat through the presser, stating that there was no reason why the expansion cannot keep going, and that there is no sector that’s booming that might bust. Later in the press conference, Powell stated that he had not said that the rate decision will be a cycle of ‘just one’ rate cut, raising the possibility of further insurance coming.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>China trade talks have concluded early, without signs of a breakthrough (NOTE: no breakthrough was expected), which injected a feeling of risk-off into markets ahead of the FOMC rate decision. However, it was later China state media said that China and US negotiators are set to meet in the US in September for further talks, who also added that talks were constructive, candid and efficient, and both sides had deep exchanges over key issues. Agriculture was reportedly discussed. Chinese commentators (like Global Times editor Hu Xijin) adopted a constructive tone on the developments. There has not been much of a mention with regards to the outstanding issues (US wants structural changes that allow American companies to compete fairly, Mnuchin has said that will alone help to address the trade deficit between the US and China; US wants China to enhance intellectual property protection, and an end to Chinese subsidies that have contributed to overproduction of steel and aluminium; US also wants China to eliminate Chinese joint venture requirements and other policies that effectively force technology transfers. China, meanwhile, demands the US remove all tariffs on Chinese goods, that the amount of goods it must purchase from the US be realistic and that demands that its \"sovereignty and dignity\" be preserved.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Analysts have been noting that PM Johnson has been focussing on a domestic agenda, while he impresses the UK will leave on the 31st October one way or another. The argument is that Johnson either needs to secure the support of the electorate to push through his hard Brexit position, or he needs to secure the support of lawmakers. The latter is proving as difficult for Johnson as it was for his predecessor, and therefore he appears to be in campaigning mode, should he face a General Election. One newswire, citing sources, said that the PM will next week announce spending plans on healthcare, which could amount to hundreds of millions. Johnson has repeatedly called on the EU to re-open negotiations, and scrap the Irish backstop, putting the onus back into the EU’s court to act, a course that may result in confrontation with both the EU, and the soft Brexit/no-Brexit lawmakers in the UK. However, later a HuffPost report suggested that Johnson’s government believes it may be able to strike a series of quick side deals to keep vital trade flowing in the event of a no-deal Brexit, once EU countries feel the disruption. The report added that the government believes individual EU members will demand that Brussels strikes agreements with the UK to protect businesses in their own countries. The Sun’s Political Editor later said that he is hearing the UK Treasury are reportedly preparing to announce a GBP 344mln No Deal border package.</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA:</strong> Britain, Germany, and France have reportedly asked the UN Security Council to convene privately on Thursday in regard to North Korea missile tests, after the nuclear ambitious nation fired new short range missiles earlier in the direction of Japan, although the missiles did not leave North Korean airspace.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> German Foreign Minister Maas said that Germany will not take part in the American initiative to help secure the Strait of Hormuz. However earlier, a German government spokesperson said it still thinks it is worth considering a naval mission in the Strait, and that they are in contact with European partners regarding the matter. Some analysts reason that if Germany were to join the maritime expedition, it could signal the end of the JCPOA, which Europe has been trying to rescue.</p><p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS: </strong>Came in at 156k against an expected 150k, and the prior was revised up by 10k to 112k. The ADP said that while we are still seeing strength in the labour market, it has shown signs of weakening, adding that moderation in growth is expected as the labour market tightens further. Moody's chief economist Zandi said that job growth was healthy, but steadily slowing, noting that small businesses are suffering the brunt of the slowdown. He added that hampering job growth are labour shortages, layoffs at bricks-and-mortar retailers, and fallout from weaker global trade. The reading is unlikely to have changed the dial too much in terms of expectations for this week's official nonfarm payroll report, where the consensus looks for 164k to be added to the US economy.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE Q2 FLASH GDP/JUNE CPI: </strong>Flash GDP growth slowed in line with expectations at +0.2% Q/Q in Q2 vs prior +0.4%. In terms of the spread, GDP growth slowed across countries in the quarter. On Tuesday, fata showed a slowing in France, and although Spain outperformed the Eurozone in general, growth still decelerated to the lowest in five years. Meanwhile, there was stagnation in Italy. \"The continued weakness in the eurozone surveys suggests that a pick-up in GDP growth in H2 2019 is not on the cards,\" Oxford Economics writes, \"coupled with subdued inflation, which fell to 1.1% in July from 1.3% in June, this will in our view trigger a policy response by the ECB at its September meeting.\"</p><p><strong>* CANADA MAY GDP: </strong>Growth in May surprised to the upside (again), rising 0.2% M/M against an expected 0.1%. \"Growth was once again broadly-based with most services industries recording gains (retail and wholesale being key exceptions) and goods production posting another solid increase,\" RBC said, \"The anticipated pullback in oil sands production materialized (mostly reflecting seasonal quirks) but was offset by growth in non-energy mining and manufacturing.\" The bank argues that the energy sector is on track to provide a nice addition to growth in Q2, after acting as a drag in the prior three quarters. RBC also notes that non-energy growth has also picked up, due to better weather and more stability in the housing sector. RBC concludes that today's solid reading leaves them tracking annualised growth of nearly 3% in Q2, above its earlier estimate and above the BOC's own forecast. \"Strong growth in the last several months underscores why the BoC has maintained a neutral policy bias even as the Fed is set to lower rates, starting this afternoon.\"</p><p><strong>* AUSTRALIA Q2 CPI:</strong> Consumer prices rose 0.6% Q/Q in Q2, with the Y/Y gauge rising to 1.6% from 1.3%, though still remains beneath the RBA’s 2-3% target band (and the RBA’s forecast of 1.7% made in May). The rise was due to the increase in petrol prices in the quarter, while housing components continued to weigh; there may be some support from the latter in the months ahead, with analysts now looking for the Aussie housing sector set to rebound, but Capital Economics says housing inflation lags house prices by around six months, so it expects the housing downturn to remain a drag on underlying inflation throughout 2019. CapEco says the RBA will not be too worried about the data, however, as it relates to the period before the government’s tax cuts took effect. Even so, CapEco says the data is further evidence of economic weakness in Australia, and it thinks that current stimulus will prove insufficient to turn the tide on the Australian economy, and argues that underlying inflation will likely fall further over the next year, reinforcing its call that the RBA will continue cutting rates to 0.50% by early next year.</p><p><strong>* BOE PREVIEW: Bank of England Monetary Policy Decision, Minutes and Quarterly Inflation Report Thursday 1st August at 12:00BST (07:00ET), Press Conference with Governor Carney at 12:30BST (07:30ET) </strong>- The MPC is once again forecast to stand pat on rates, as the ongoing uncertainty posed by Brexit continues to tie the hands of policymakers. The BoE is expected to maintain its guidance that rates will continue to rise at “a gradual pace and to a limited extent”, however, a speech by Governor Carney at the beginning of the month suggests this week’s message could be more dovish than the one seen in previous months. For the full preview, <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22412/download\">click here.</a></p><p><strong>* BCB PREVIEW: </strong>Expectations of a BCB rate cut have heightened as key activity indicators suggest little growth in the quarter, presenting risks that the Brazilian economy might have contracted in the first half of the year. Some argue that the BCB could trim rates by as much as 50bps from the current 6.5%. With a relatively stable BRL and oil, there are little signs of an immediate inflation surge ahead, barring a significant growth spurt; it is expected to gradually drift towards the central bank’s target. SocGen argues that, in a situation where meaningful fiscal stimulus to the economy is unlikely, and private demand growth remains lukewarm, it makes sense to use monetary policy as liberally as possible given a very low risk of inflation breaching the target due to persistently weak demand and, and to provide a policy impulse to demand. The bank thinks the key issues for the BCB are now: 1) The extent of additional monetary accommodation it can provide given that the policy rate is already at a near two-decade low (will likely depend on BRL, with stability giving the BCB more scope to cut rates), 2) how quickly it should cut rates considering the factors that have led it to keep rates unchanged so far this year (may need to be planned based on how the market reacts to BCB policy), 3) The risks that could lead to a reversal in the downward trajectory of rates sooner than warranted to help recovery (depends on growth and inflation). SocGen now expects the BCB to resume easing in July with a 25bps rate cut to 6.25%, but signal caution since the pension bill is yet to be cleared. The bank can see rates falling to 5.00% by the end of the year, and its baseline view is that the BCB will not need to begin raising rates in 2020.</p><p><strong>* CBRT INFLATION REPORT: </strong>The Turkish central bank revised its inflation forecasts lower, to 13.9% from 15.0% in the previous survey. The central bank emphasised the importance of sustaining the disinflation process and its cautious monetary stance, signalling that it will likely come up with measured moves in upcoming MPC meetings. Analysts at ING said the CBRT took advantage of the downtrend in inflation dynamics and recovering inflation expectations – as well as the improving political and geopolitical backdrop – with a deeper than expected cut in July. The release has some remarks from the new governor, who emphasised maintaining the disinflation process and the cautious monetary stance, signalling that the central bank will likely come up with measured moves in the upcoming MPC meetings, ING says. “Accordingly, we expect two more cuts in the September and October MPC meetings and see the policy rate at 17.50% at the end of this year,” the bank writes, “However, risks are to the downside given Governor Uysal’s statement that there is significant room to manoeuvre as signalled by current projections.”</p><p><strong>* TREASURY QUARTERLY REFUNDING: </strong>US is to sell USD 38bln in 3-year notes, USD 27bln in 10-year notes and 19bln in 30-year bonds, with sizes unchanged. US quarterly refunding USD 84bln to raise USD 26.7bln of cash, and refund USD 57.3bln in maturing securities. Analysts noted that the Treasury announced no changes to its coupon auctions. \"Despite some shifts in the timing, the overall story for T-bill supply has not changed on balance,\" Wells Fargo says, \"we expect an inflection point in bill supply is imminent, and is unlikely to reverse until next April's tax receipts come in.\"</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 127-13+:</strong> The US treasury curve bull flattened with the 2s30s narrowing by around 10bp after the fed’s decision to trim rates by 25bp. The T complex saw a specifically bullish catalyst as the balance sheet tapering was to finish 2 months early with some analysts suggesting the fed could purchase up to USD 35-40bln of additional treasuries over the next 2 months. Looking through to the end of the year markets now price 35bp of easing (before the 25bp cut decision 68bp of easing was priced) as pricing becomes a bit more hawkish prior to the meeting.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLES USD 0.53 HIGHER AT USD 58.58/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 0.42 HIGHER AT USD 65.05/BBL: </strong>The energy complex was supported by a cocktail of bullish US inventories and renewed supply disruptions at Libya’s pinnacle El Sharara oilfield; however, the bullish dollar reaction post the FOMC cut was a mixed signal for the oil market, as the lower rates are theoretically supposed to boost demand. The EIA confirmed the API reported draws, where crude stocks fell by 8.5mln bbls (exp. -2.6mln), and the Cushing delivery hub saw its crude inventory fall by 1.5mln bbls; gasoline stocks drew by 1.8mln bbls (exp. -1.8mln), and distillates printed a surprise draw of 0.9mln bbls (exp. +1.0mln). Refinery utilisation decreased again by -0.1%, raising the question if whether the draws in the products are a function of weaker end-user demand, which has been reflected in weaker manufacturing data. US production ramped up to 12.2mln bpd (prev. 11.3mln), although this was unsurprising given the distortion from Tropical Storm Barry. Libya’s El Sharara oilfield (300k bpd) declared a force majeure after what reports suggest being more sabotage attempts. Elsewhere, a Reuters survey showed OPEC July oil output at 29mln, 280k BPD lower than June (the lowest since 2011), and a Saudi source said that OPEC’s largest producer will continue to produce below 10mln bpd in coming months (below the OPEC target) and its July production stood at 9.6mln bpd (June was 9.8mln bpd). It is also worth highlighting that the expiration of August Brent futures (U9), which is likely to have been a factor in Wednesday’s tape action.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -1.1% at 2980, NASDAQ-100 -1.3% at 7849, Dow Jones&nbsp; -1.2% at 26863, SECTORS; </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary -1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples -2%, S&amp;P 500 Energy -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Financials -0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care -1%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials -1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology -1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; 1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services -1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities -0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) shot higher after the co. reported strong top and bottom-line earnings and decent gains in non-iPhone revenue vindicated the co.’s diversification efforts. China sales were also a bright spot. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell after the co. posted disappointing revenue guidance, despite profit and revenue for Q2 printing inline. Some important health care names reported; Amgen (AMGN) and Humana (HUM) advanced after both co.’s posted strong Q2 earnings and raised FY guidance. Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell, despite the co. beating on top and bottom lines, as revenue was guided slightly below street expectations. Electronic Arts (EA) and Garmin (GRMN) both shot higher after the companies posted strong top and bottom-line earnings and raised guidance. Desks also noted optimism regarding EA Apex Legends sales in FY20. Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP) sunk after the brewer missed on the top and bottom lines.&nbsp; Other notable stocks benefitting from decent earnings include; Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM), Allstate Corp (ALL), Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cincinnati Financial (CINF), Johnson Controls International (JCI), ONEOK (OKE), Hess Corporation (HES), Southwestern Energy Corp. (SWE), Moody's Corp (MCO). Notable stocks suffering on poor earnings; General Electric (GE), GrubHub (GRUB) and Dominion Energy (D). Elsewhere, Boeing (BA) stocks were pressured by damning premarket reports, which alleged an internal risk analysis after the first of the two Boeing (BA) 737 MAX airliner crashes showed the likelihood was high of a similar cockpit emergency within months.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> made fresh YTD highs after the Fed opted to cut rates by 25bps (the market had been pricing a small chance of a 50bps cut). Despite the Fed cutting rates, an action that would normally contribute to dollar weakness, the dollar strengthened. Desks justified the move due to the fact that the cut will be supportive of global growth, where the dollar would likely benefit, particularly if other CBs also loosen policy. Additionally, there was pricing for a more dovish policy announcement, with today’s decision falling somewhere between what the hawks and doves were looking for. Finally, there was hawkish dissent, blunting any dovish edge, also suggesting that the committee is not completely unanimous in its path for policy. <strong>EUR</strong> sunk; EURUSD making fresh YTD lows around 1.1070. <strong>Safe havens</strong> were also sold; USDJPY moved back towards the 109.00 figure, which was not breached during Wednesday trade. <strong>GBP</strong> was comparatively firm, finding support as the European session drew to a close, where shorts were covered/profits booked ahead of the FOMC; cable at one point moving back above 1.22 prior to FOMC related dollar strength. The APAC session saw a divergence in the fortunes of the <strong>antipodeans</strong>; <strong>AUD</strong> was supported by better than expected inflation data, while <strong>NZD</strong> was hit by a poor NBNZ Business Outlook print. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker after the dollar strengthened.

The EIA confirmed the API reported draws, where crude stocks fell by 8.5mln bbls (exp. -2.6mln), and the Cushing delivery hub saw its crude inventory fall by 1.5mln bbls; gasoline stocks drew by 1.8mln bbls (exp. -1.8mln), and distillates printed a surprise draw of 0.9mln bbls (exp. +1.0mln). Refinery utilisation decreased again by -0.1%, raising the question if whether the draws in the products are a function of weaker end-user demand, which has been reflected in weaker manufacturing data. US production ramped up to 12.2mln bpd (prev. 11.3mln), although this was unsurprising given the distortion from Tropical Storm Barry. Libya’s El Sharara oilfield (300k bpd) declared a force majeure after what reports suggest being more sabotage attempts. Elsewhere, a Reuters survey showed OPEC July oil output at 29mln, 280k BPD lower than June (the lowest since 2011), and a Saudi source said that OPEC’s largest producer will continue to produce below 10mln bpd in coming months (below the OPEC target) and its July production stood at 9.6mln bpd (June was 9.8mln bpd). It is also worth highlighting that the expiration of August Brent futures (U9), which is likely to have been a factor in Wednesday’s tape action.</p>",

This has been framed by analysts as a neutral cut, since language has been maintained that the Fed can cut further if it needs to, but there does not seem any explicit pledge to cut rates further. Additionally, the two dissenters have blunted the dovish impact, suggesting that the whole Committee is not certain about the policy path. The news that the balance sheet normalisation plan would end early, however, was dovish for the Treasury complex. Market reaction to the decision and statement was very choppy, and seems to have settled to around pre-announced levels (SPX 3013 vs 3015 before; T-Note 127-15 vs 127-18 before, DXY at 98.30 vs 98.09 before, and XAU at 1424 vs 1425 ahead of the decision).</p>",

However, Chinese state media highlighted that the discussions were “constructive, candid, efficient” and the next round of high-level consultation will take place in September, with working level talks to take place next month. DXY is set to end EU trade flat, having traded in a 98.00-98.13 intraday band.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Short squeeze/profit taking heading into tonight key risk event has given the Pound enough impetus to reclaim 1.2200 to the upside vs. the Dollar. Cable pushed higher in late EU trade (having earlier printed a low of 1.2150) with clean air until 1.2399 (17 Jul low) ahead of the psychological 1.2400. Meanwhile, EUR/GBP threatened to give up the 0.9100 mark (intraday 0.9111-83) amid the late Sterling strength. EUR/USD remains flat having hardly extended its 20-pip intraday range (1.1140-60), albeit the pair is poised to end the EU session at the bottom of the range amid EUR/GBP influence.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD, JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The Aussie remained buoyed throughout European trade in light of promising domestic inflation data overnight which topped estimates but remains below the RBA’s inflation target range. Conversely, a deterioration in NZ business confidence and activity outlook kept the Kiwi under pressure with little reprieve from the fallout of Shanghai trade talks. AUD/USD is poised for a positive EU close, around the top of a 0.6862-6900 range on the day, whilst its Kiwi counterpart forfeited the 0.6600 handle and looks to end the European day at the bottom of the intraday range (0.6588-6600). Elsewhere, above-forecast Canadian GDP (MM 0.2% vs. Exp. 0.1%) alongside firmer oil prices have taken USD/CAD back to sub-1.3150 levels and to the bottom of today’s 1.3160-3120 parameter. Meanwhile, little to report on the safe-haven front and largely sideways trade in anticipation of Central Bank action with USD/JPY and USD/CHF still within their 108.50-65 0.9894-9913 intraday ranges respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another day of gains for the Lira as traders anticipated the CBRT’s QIR signalled further normalisation. The Central Bank cut its 2019 year-end inflation forecast mid-point to 13.9% from 14.6%, adding that the economic outlook has brightened compared to the April release. However, the Minutes noted that elevated levels of inflation continue to pose upside risks for the inflation outlook. USD/TRY has drifted off lows after earlier breaching its 200 DMA (5.5600) to the downside and took out a support level at 5.5500 to print a low of 5.5150 ahead of a Fib support at 5.4172.</p>",

Some argue that the BCB could trim rates by as much as 50bps from the current 6.5%. With a relatively stable BRL and oil, there are little signs of an immediate inflation surge ahead, barring a significant growth spurt; it is expected to gradually drift towards the central bank’s target. SocGen argues that, in a situation where meaningful fiscal stimulus to the economy is unlikely, and private demand growth remains lukewarm, it makes sense to use monetary policy as liberally as possible given a very low risk of inflation breaching the target due to persistently weak demand and, and to provide a policy impulse to demand. The bank thinks the key issues for the BCB are now: 1) The extent of additional monetary accommodation it can provide given that the policy rate is already at a near two-decade low (will likely depend on BRL, with stability given the BCB more scope to cut rates), 2) how quickly it should cut rates considering the factors that have led it to keep rates unchanged so far this year (may need to be planned based on how the market reacts to BCB policy), 3) The risks that could lead to a reversal in the downward trajectory of rates sooner than warranted to help recovery (depends on growth and inflation). SocGen now expects the BCB to resume easing in July with a 25bps rate cut to 6.25%, but signal caution since the pension bill is yet to be cleared. The bank can see rates falling to 5.00% by the end of the year, and its baseline view is that the BCB will not need to begin raising rates in 2020.</p>",

Conversely, its main rival Apple saw a different fate with the US tech giant gaining around 4.5% after-hours due to a beat on both top and bottom lines and although it missed on iPhone sales its revenue forecast for next quarter surpassed Street estimates. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%)</strong> conformed to the wide risk averse tone after President Trump’s recent criticism on China and warning of a much tougher deal if China holds out until after the next US elections, with participants also digesting mixed Chinese PMI data in which the headline Manufacturing PMI beat expectations but remained below the 50 benchmark level and Non-Manufacturing PMI missed forecasts. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded relatively flat and were only marginally supported by the risk averse tone as well as the BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 1.24tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

Sectors are also mixed with no standout sector at present. In terms of this mornings earnings, L’Oreal (-3.8%) are under pressure after missing on sales growth in-spite of the Co’s CEO noting that H1 was the strongest in terms of like-for-like growth in decades; notably the Co. also announced a EUR 750mln share buyback. Sticking with the CAC 40 (+0.1%) this morning also saw earnings from Airbus (+0.8%) who beat on Q2 revenue and confirmed FY guidance; recently, the Co. also benefitting recently from WSJ reports indicating that internal risk analysis at Boeing (BA) showed the likelihood was high of further cockpit emergencies following the first crash. Elsewhere, of note for banking names Credit Suisse (+4.2%) are firmer after beating on Q2 net revenue and net income as are BNP Paribas (+3.5%) post earnings where the Co’s Q2 revenue beat on consensus.</p><p>A Tesla (TSLA) vehicle reportedly burnt down to 'not much more than a pile of ashes' for 'no apparent reason' in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia, according to Stern.de.</p><p>Apple Inc (AAPL) reported Q3 EPS USD 2.18 vs. Exp.

USD 61bln. <i>Co. shares rose 4.5% after-market. </i>(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD, NZD -</strong> The Aussie stands as this morning’s G10 winner amid promising domestic inflation data which follows the RBA’s back-to-back rate cuts since June. CPI Y/Y rose to 1.6% (Prev. 1.3%) in Q2 but remains below the Central Bank’s 2-3% target. In terms of implications on monetary policy, the CB is likely to stand pat on rates for now in order to examine further effects of its recent rate cuts and the government’s tax cut package. AUD/USD trades closer to the top of the intraday range thus far, after testing 0.6900 to the upside. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is lacklustre after the ANZ business confidence further deteriorated alongside the activity outlook. NZD/USD hovers just above the 0.6600 mark having visited a current intra-day low of 0.6590.</p><p><strong>DXY, CNY -</strong> Relatively side-ways trade for the DXY (for now) heading into the FOMC’s latest policy decision (full preview available in the Research Suite) and with little impetus from the fallout of US-China talks in Shanghai. The initial reports/commentary on the meeting provided little substance. Although no breakthrough was reached (as expected), discussions are said to have been constructive and future talks between the nations will happen. DXY remains flat above 98.00 having earlier tested the figure to the downside. Meanwhile, the CNH also remains tentative and within a narrow range vs. the Buck after having visited its 50 DMA (6.8967) at the European open.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR -</strong> Overall little changed thus far with the Pound capped amid fears of a Halloween no-deal crash and tomorrow’s BoE policy decision and QIR (full preview available in the Research Suite). GBP/USD continues to meander sub-1.2200, and as a reminder, the following support levels are still in play: 1.2110 (March 17 low), 1.2085 (Jan 17 low), 1.2000 (psychological) and 1.1841 (2016 flash crash low). Elsewhere The EUR remains flat within a 20-pip intraday range as mostly in-line inflation, growth and unemployment metrics failed to spur a reaction ahead of the FOMC’s policy decision. EUR/USD trades just below 1.1150 ahead of minor support levels at 1.1133/14/21/01, although large option expiries (1.3bln at 1.1145 and 1.2bln at 1.1100-05) may keep the pair contained heading into today’s NY cut.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Another day of gains for the Lira as traders anticipated the CBRT’s QIR to signal further normalisation in its domestic economy, in which it delivered. The Central Bank cut its 2019 year-end inflation forecast mid-point to 13.9% from 14.6% whilst its 2020 figure was maintained at 8.2%, adding that the economic outlook has brightened compared to the April release.

This cautiousness has dominated sentiment across the fixed complex this morning in-spite of the data slate thus far including EZ CPI and GDP flash metrics, albeit the metrics did print largely in-line. The core European Bond is once again trading within a narrow range (174.53-71) as are its European counterparts with the mild exception of BTPs currently just shy of the days 139.69 high, in-spite of better than expected unemployment metrics as harmonised CPI just missed expectations. Looking ahead, and in focus for USTs which are once again painting a similarly tentative picture, is the aforementioned FOMC but prior to this markets receive one last data input in the form of ADP which is expected at 150k (Prev. 102k); although, due to the limited reaction from yesterdays PCE report and the release occurring in the 11th hour it’s unlikely to garner as much focus as normal.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The oil complex has held onto most of its API-induced gains with WTI futures hovering just below USD 58.50/bbl and Brent north of USD 65/bbl.

Traders today will be eyeing two events as catalysts: 1) The weekly EIA report for confirmation of the decline in stocks, 2) the FOMC’s policy decision for any Dollar or sentiment-induced action. Elsewhere, sources stated that Libya’s El-Sharara oilfield (300k BPD) has halted production amid a valve closure on a pipeline, although it is not clear how long the closures could last. Of note, WaPo reported that the Trump administration is set to announce that it will waiver five difference nuclear related sanctions on Iran, although it is currently unclear whether the waivers will be oil related.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European indices are mixed [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%],</strong> as this morning saw the early finish of US-China trade talks with initial reports indicating that the talks ended with no sign of a breakthrough (as expected). Sectors are also mixed with no standout sector at present. In terms of this morning’s earnings, L’Oreal (-4.20%) are under pressure after missing on sales growth in-spite of the Co’s CEO noting that H1 was the strongest in terms of like-for-like growth in decades; notably the Co. also announced a EUR 750mln share buyback. Sticking with the CAC 40 (+0.1%), this morning also saw earnings from Airbus (+0.8%) who topped Q2 revenue estimates and confirmed FY guidance; recently, the Co. is also benefitting recently from WSJ reports indicating that internal risk analysis at Boeing showed the likelihood was high of further cockpit emergencies following the first crash. Elsewhere, of note for banking names, Credit Suisse (+4.4%) is firmer after beating on Q2 net revenue and net income as are BNP Paribas (+3.5%) post earnings where the Co’s Q2 revenue beat on consensus. Finally, at the top and bottom of the Stoxx 600 respectively are Next (+8.5%) and Intu Properties (-25.5%) after earnings where the Co’s increased profit guidance and posted a H1 loss of GBP 830mln respectively.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong> - The Aussie stands as this morning’s G10 winner amid promising domestic inflation data which follows the RBA’s back-to-back rate cuts since June. CPI Y/Y rose to 1.6% (Prev. 1.3%) in Q2 but remains below the Central Bank’s 2-3% target. In terms of implications on monetary policy, the CB is likely to stand pat on rates for now in order to examine further effects of its recent rate cuts and the government’s tax cut package. AUD/USD trades closer to the top of the intraday range thus far, after testing 0.6900 to the upside. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is lacklustre after the ANZ business confidence further deteriorated alongside the activity outlook. NZD/USD hovers just above the 0.6600 mark having visited a current intra-day low of 0.6590.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY, CNY</strong> - Relatively side-ways trade for the DXY (for now) heading into the FOMC’s latest policy decision (full preview available in the Research Suite) and with little impetus from the fallout of US-China talks in Shanghai. The initial reports/commentary on the meeting provided little substance. Although no breakthrough was reached (as expected), discussions are said to have been constructive and future talks between the nations will happen. DXY remains flat above 98.00 having earlier tested the figure to the downside. Meanwhile, the CNH also remains tentative and within a narrow range vs. the Buck after having visited its 50 DMA (6.8967) at the European open.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong> - Overall little changed thus far with the Pound capped amid fears of a Halloween no-deal crash and tomorrow’s BoE policy decision and QIR (full preview available in the Research Suite). GBP/USD continues to meander sub-1.2200, and as a reminder, the following support levels are still in play: 1.2110 (March 17 low), 1.2085 (Jan 17 low), 1.2000 (psychological) and 1.1841 (2016 flash crash low). Elsewhere The EUR remains flat within a 20-pip intraday range as mostly in-line inflation, growth and unemployment metrics failed to spur a reaction ahead of the FOMC’s policy decision. EUR/USD trades just below 1.1150 ahead of minor support levels at 1.1133/14/21/01, although large option expiries (1.3bln at 1.1145 and 1.2bln at 1.1100-05) may keep the pair contained heading into today’s NY cut.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Another day of gains for the Lira as traders anticipated the CBRT’s QIR to signal further normalisation in its domestic economy, in which it delivered. The Central Bank cut its 2019 year-end inflation forecast mid-point to 13.9% from 14.6% whilst its 2020 figure was maintained at 8.2%, adding that the economic outlook has brightened compared to the April release. USD/TRY breached its 200 DMA (5.5600) to the downside and took out a support level at 5.5500 to print a low of 5.5150 ahead of a Fib support at 5.4172.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A quiet and tentative start to the session for Bonds, as markets are cautious ahead of today’s FOMC decision where expectations are for a 25bps cut; in addition, the initial reports around US-China trade talks indicate that no substantial breakthroughs were made but talks are to continue in the future.

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie stands as this morning’s G10 winner amid promising domestic inflation data which follows the RBA’s back-to-back rate cuts since June. CPI Y/Y rose to 1.6% (Prev. 1.3%) in Q2 but remains below the Central Bank’s 2-3% target. In terms of implications on monetary policy, the CB is likely to stand pat on rates for now in order to examine further effects of its recent rate cuts and the government’s tax cut package. AUD/USD trades closer to the top of the intraday range thus far, after testing 0.6900 to the upside. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is lacklustre after the ANZ business confidence further deteriorated alongside the activity outlook. NZD/USD hovers just above the 0.6600 mark having visited a current intra-day low of 0.6590.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY, CNY</strong></p><p>Relatively side-ways trade for the DXY (for now) heading into the FOMC’s latest policy decision (full preview available in the Research Suite) and with little impetus from the fallout of US-China talks in Shanghai. The initial reports/commentary on the meeting provided little substance. Although no breakthrough was reached (as expected), discussions are said to have been constructive and future talks between the nations will happen. DXY remains flat above 98.00 having earlier tested the figure to the downside. Meanwhile, the CNH also remains tentative and within a narrow range vs. the Buck after having visited its 50 DMA (6.8967) at the European open.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Overall little changed thus far with the Pound capped amid fears of a Halloween no-deal crash and tomorrow’s BoE policy decision and QIR (full preview available in the Research Suite). GBP/USD continues to meander sub-1.2200, and as a reminder, the following support levels are still in play: 1.2110 (March 17 low), 1.2085 (Jan 17 low), 1.2000 (psychological) and 1.1841 (2016 flash crash low). Elsewhere The EUR remains flat within a 20-pip intraday range as mostly in-line inflation, growth and unemployment metrics failed to spur a reaction ahead of the FOMC’s policy decision. EUR/USD trades just below 1.1150 ahead of minor support levels at 1.1133/14/21/01, although large option expiries (1.3bln at 1.1145 and 1.2bln at 1.1100-05) may keep the pair contained heading into today’s NY cut.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another day of gains for the Lira as traders anticipated the CBRT’s QIR to signal further normalisation in its domestic economy, in which it delivered. The Central Bank cut its 2019 year-end inflation forecast mid-point to 13.9% from 14.6% whilst its 2020 figure was maintained at 8.2%, adding that the economic outlook has brightened compared to the April release. USD/TRY breached its 200 DMA (5.5600) to the downside and took out a support level at 5.5500 to print a low of 5.5150 ahead of a Fib support at 5.4172.</p>",

This cautiousness has dominated sentiment across the fixed complex this morning in-spite of the data slate thus far including EZ CPI and GDP flash metrics, albeit the metrics did print largely in-line. The core European Bond is once again trading within a narrow range (174.53-71) as are its European counterparts with the mild exception of BTPs currently just shy of the days 139.69 high, in-spite of better than expected unemployment metrics as harmonised CPI just missed expectations. Looking ahead, and in focus for USTs which are once again painting a similarly tentative picture, is the aforementioned FOMC but prior to this markets receive one last data input in the form of ADP which is expected at 150k (Prev. 102k); although, due to the limited reaction from yesterdays PCE report and the release occurring in the 11th hour it’s unlikely to garner as much focus as normal.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets follows suit to the negative performance seen across global peers amid trade concerns following US President Trump’s Twitter rant regarding China, while the looming FOMC decision, mixed Chinese PMI data and earnings deluge adds to the cautious tone. ASX 200 (-0.2%) is dragged lower by losses in utilities and financials but with downside stemmed by strength in the energy sector after a rally in oil prices, while Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) suffers the ill-effects of a firmer currency with the best and worst performers in Tokyo driven by their quarterly results. KOSPI (-1.0%) weakened after North Korea conducted another launch which was said to be a new type of weapon and with earnings also in focus including index heavyweight Samsung Electronics which showed final Q2 oper. profit and revenue topped preliminary results but still suffered a 56% Y/Y drop in profits. Conversely, its main rival Apple saw a different fate with the US tech giant gaining around 4.5% after-hours due to a beat on both top and bottom lines and although it missed on iPhone sales its revenue forecast for next quarter surpassed Street estimates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) conform to wide risk averse tone after President Trump’s recent criticism on China and warning of a much tougher deal if China holds out until after the next US elections, with participants also digesting mixed Chinese PMI data in which the headline Manufacturing PMI beat expectations at 49.7 vs. Exp. 49.6 but still remained below the 50 benchmark level and Non-Manufacturing PMI disappointed at 53.7 vs. Exp. 54.0.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat around the 98.00 level amid a non-committal tone across most major currencies ahead of today’s FOMC meeting, where the Fed is expected to lower rates as markets price in an 82% chance of a 25bps cut and 18% chance of a more aggressive 50bps reduction. The greenback’s transatlantic counterparts are also tentative with EUR/USD contained nearby a large option expiry of EUR 1.4bln at 1.1145 for today’s New York cut, while GBP/USD is flat around short-term support at 1.2150 to provide some respite from its recent Brexit-related rout. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is subdued amid the uninspiring risk tone, while antipodeans are mixed with NZD/USD suffering following a further deterioration in business survey data and with AUD/USD underpinned after firmer than expected headline Australian CPI data which saw the odds of a cut by the RBA next week drop to 16.00% from 34.75%</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices marginally supported by the risk averse tone as well as the BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 1.24tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
