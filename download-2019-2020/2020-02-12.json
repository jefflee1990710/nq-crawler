Furthermore, Mnuchin added that the implementation of the mini-trade deal with China has slowed down due to the nCoV and that the entire \"chapters\" of Phase Two have been \"dealt with\".

Preliminary data indicated that global oil supply in January decreased by 10k BPD M/M to an average of 100.12mln BPD, up 780k BPD Y/Y, while OPEC crude production fell by 509k BPD M/M to average 28.86mln BPD according to secondary sources.

The session got off on the front foot following a declining reported rate of new coronavirus cases and deaths, adding support to the \"transitory\" nature of the outbreak, raising hopes of a v-shaped global recovery. Micron (MU) traded with solid gains following an upgrade at UBS, where the desk noted the time has finally arrived when MU can materially outperform over a sustained period, believing it is in a much stronger position in a better-positioned industry on the cusp of a cyclical upswing, and that DRAM should perform well in 2021. Elsewhere in the Semiconductor space, Qualcomm (QCOM) opened higher following an upgrade at Daiwa, who noted the potential QCOM has due to its 5G positioning. The energy sector drove gains in the SPX as oil prices rebounded today following the recent heavy declines. SPX +0.64% at 3379, DJIA +0.9% at 29,551, NDX +1% at 9613.</p><p>The TPLEX bear steepened on Wednesday, ahead of Treasury supply with the T-Note seeing the most pronounced selling (compared to other maturities), as risk appetite continued to improve. Similar to Tuesday, the majority of the move happened in the overnight session, before finding its floor in early European trade. Desks note the selling was lead by real money as dealers sought concession ahead of the 10-year auction, in what was, more broadly, the most expensive since October. Nonetheless, the USD 27bln refunding auction was fairly decent, stopping through the 1.623% WI by 0.1bps, covered 2.58x (vs. six-auction average 2.41x), and dealers didn’t have to take down as much as usual, with both directs and indirects taking more than average. How much higher the 10-year yield can move in the near term remains up to debate, there are suggestions of algos/programme sellers “lurking” above 1.64% on the 10-year yield, a level which heavy gamma hedging took place last week, a level which could be tested if expectations move closer to that of a v-shaped recovery in the global economy post the coronavirus. By settlement, yields were higher across the curve with the 10-year yield at 1.63%, seeing the 2s10s widen by just under 1.5bps. US T-note futures (H20) settled 10 ticks lower at 130-22.</p>",

The session got off on the front foot following a declining reported rate of new coronavirus cases and deaths, adding support to the \"transitory\" nature of the outbreak, raising hopes of a v-shaped global recovery. Meanwhile, the DXY topped the key 99.00 figure, whilst the Euro cross dipped beneath the 1.09 figure to multi-year lows - XAU traded slightly lower. Further supporting the greenback was the bear steepening of the Treasury curve, with the T-Note seeing the most pronounced selling ahead of its auction/refunding, which fared decent demand.&nbsp; Looking ahead, earnings from NVDA and PEP are expected on Thursday, as is the Fed's less preferred inflation measure, CPI (Jan), whilst participants will also be looking for more signs of the coronavirus outbreak abating.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>China reported an additional 2015 coronavirus cases and 97 deaths as of February 11th vs. 2478 additional cases and 108 deaths on Feb. 10th, to bring total confirmed cases to 44653 and death toll at 1113. Goldman Sachs’ analysts, using their “high-frequency indicators for tracking the spread” of the virus, also note a declining rate of new cases in both Hubei and the rest of mainland China, suggesting to the bank that the slowing is probably due to the strict travel control and self-isolation. Participants are constrained on whether the virus will prove to be transitory, such as previous similar outbreaks (SARS/MERS) have been, or could hold a more systemic change to the global supply chain and global output.</p><p><strong>* FED POWELL TESTIMONY: </strong>Fed Chair Powell, in the final day of his Senate Testimony, said we will be able to see the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in the economic data \"fairly soon,\" after yesterday announcing they were studying it closely. Powell added that he thinks the idea of putting Treasuries and reserves on an equal footing is a “good goal” – following the repo market’s squeeze last year which saw PDs struggle to attain cash for their Treasury holdings. Powell said that he is now concerned about the level of US debt. Elsewhere on the economy, the Fed Chair stated there is nothing about that is unbalanced or out of kilter, noting that there is a squeeze going on in the US housing sector due to a lack of affordability and that he believes there is more upside to the labour participation rate; note, yesterday Powell said the Fed would “never” say it had accomplished the goal of making sure anyone who wants to work and can work will have a job available for them.</p><p><strong>* NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY:</strong> After Tuesday evening’s Primary, Sanders came out in front, as expected, at 25.7%, although Buttigieg came narrowly second at 24.4%, a narrower margin than Sanders would probably have liked to see given his supposed dominance in the State. Furthermore, Klobuchar came third at 19.8%, making solid ground following polls (Warren fourth at 9.2% and Biden fifth at 8.4%) that put the Minnesota Senator in the single digits. One UBS analyst notes Klobuchar’s mid-Western and Middle America appeal could have her stand a good fight against President Trump, noting her grossing popularity on the back of the Iowa caucus, although caveats that her “impassioned centrism” could serve as her weak point.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed’s Daly (non-voter, dovish) said average inflation targeting over a long period makes sense, but not talking about much above 2%. Daly added that right now the natural rate of unemployment is lower than we thought heading into the expansion, but believes it is where we currently are at around 3.5%.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> OPEC cut its 2020 global oil demand growth forecast by 230k BPD from its prior report to 990k BPD – the outbreak of the Coronavirus in China during H1 is the major factor behind the downward revision. The report added that preliminary data indicates that global oil supply in January decreased by 10k BPD to an average of 100.12mln BPD, up by 780k BPD Y/Y. In January, OPEC crude production fell by 509k BPD M/M to average 28.86mln BPD, according to secondary sources. Crude output increased in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, while production decreased mainly in Libya (-344k BPD MM), Iraq, and Kuwait. Click <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/opec-monthly-oil-market-report-feb-2020-global-oil-demand-growth-forecast-revised-down-global-oil-supply-decreased-opec-production-fell-12-02-2020\">here</a> for the full release.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.23 HIGHER AT USD 51.17/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 1.78 HIGHER AT USD 55.79/BBL.</strong> Energy outperformed on Wednesday alongside equities, with many citing the reported declining rate of new coronavirus helping the oil benchmarks push to the higher end of their February trading ranges; note a bearish EIA weekly report saw prices pare back somewhat. Oil prices were already on the front foot from the Asia session, ignoring a bearish private inventory report on Tuesday evening, before breaking higher as US participants came to their desks. Citigroup's energy analysts highlight the \"surge in RBOB gasoline on the back of some unplanned refinery outages, including a fire at Exxon Mobile’s 502k BPD Baton Rouge refinery, although production units don’t appear to have been involved.\" However, some added greenback strength and an acutely bearish EIA weekly report saw some profit-taking/concession: crude stocks (bbls) built a crushing 7.5mln, more than double expectations and the preliminary indications, while production rose by 100k BPD to 13.0mln BPD; however, the products both printed draws amid a ramp-up in refinery utilisation. Meanwhile, following the Russian Energy Ministry's meeting with domestic corporates to discuss the OPEC+ meeting/extended cut proposals, it was reported that no decision had yet been made, with Lukoil suggesting many were in favour for an extended cut to the end of Q2 but gave no mention of whether the group would support any deeper cuts as the OPEC JTC had recommended. Looking ahead, oil prices now stand at a key point, if global sentiment continues to warm amid failing coronavirus concerns, WTI and Brent could find themselves breaking their February highs of 52.20 and 56.77, respectively, and begin to pare back some of the heavy losses experienced in January - although a worsening global demand picture due to nCoV, in addition to an unsupportive OPEC, could limit further gains.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 10 TICKS LOWER AT 130-22: </strong>The TPLEX bear steepened on Wednesday, ahead of Treasury supply with the T-Note seeing the most pronounced selling (compared to other maturities), as risk appetite continued to improve. Similar to Tuesday, the majority of the move happened in the overnight session, before finding its floor in early European trade. Desks note the selling was lead by real money as dealers sought concession ahead of the 10-year auction, in what was, more broadly, the most expensive since October. Nonetheless, the USD 27bln refunding auction was fairly decent, stopping through the 1.623% WI by 0.1bps, covered 2.58x (vs. six-auction average 2.41x), and dealers didn’t have to take down as much as usual, with both directs and indirects taking more than average. How much higher the 10-year yield can move in the near term remains up to debate, there are suggestions of algos/programme sellers “lurking” above 1.64% on the 10-year yield, a level which heavy gamma hedging took place last week, a level which could be tested if expectations move closer to that of a v-shaped recovery in the global economy post the coronavirus. By settlement, yields were higher across the curve with the 10-year yield at 1.63%, seeing the 2s10s widen by just under 1.5bps.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ:</strong> The OCR was left on hold at 1.00% as was widely expected while issuing a neutral outlook for its key interest rate. The Central Bank noted that policy has time to adjust if needed and that low-interest rates remain necessary to keep employment and inflation around the target. Furthermore, the rate path was lifted in which it sees the OCR at 1.00% in June 2020 and 1.10% in June 2021 (vs. Prev. 0.9% through to March 2021) – thus alluding to no rate cuts during the period, the rate path also imply a hike by end-2021, which some desks perceived as “hawkish” in essence. The Bank warned that the Coronavirus outbreak has presented downside risk, although some were surprised that the RBNZ only assume a 0.3ppt hit to NZD Q1 GDP - “We assume the overall economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in New Zealand will be of a short duration, with most of the impacts in the first half of 2020.”, the statement said. Post-decision, Governor Orr stated that the virus outbreak is a risk that could have a larger impact but reassured the Central Bank has time to respond. Orr added that they are looking at the assumption of a 6-week disruption due to coronavirus and have taken half of the expected GDP growth for Q1 off the table in projections amid the outbreak. In light of the decision, ASB pulled their forecast for a May 2020 OCR reduction “unless the impacts of the coronavirus prove to be much larger and more prolonged than the short, sharp impact viral outbreaks tend to have”</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK: </strong>As expected the Riksbank left rates unchanged at 0.0%. Focus going into the meeting was on its outlook for CPIF, on which the Riksbank downgraded its 2020 forecast to 1.3% vs. December’s forecast of 1.7%; citing that falling energy prices are expected to dampen inflation this year. However, their assessment thereafter is that inflation will be in proximity to the 2% target. Prices aside, the repo rate forecast was unchanged from December’s meeting which sees rate unchanged until 2022 where 10bp of upside is priced in. On the macro-front, the Riksbank believes the coronavirus will reduce short-term global growth but, at present, it is difficult to assess the economic consequences fully. Some desks have interpreted this language as a larger acknowledgement of the potential impact of the virus when compared with G10 peers. The subsequent press conference didn’t reveal anything too pertinent aside from reiterations of the initial statement; Governor Ingves stated that as declines in inflation are largely down to inflation, it is hard to see a rate cut. Looking ahead, focus turns to the minutes (21st Feb) any further guidance/commentary on the inflation outlook. More pertinently, given that Breman and Jansson dissented the December rate hike, it will be interesting to acquire their opinion on the decision as from February’s release it does not appear as if there was any significant opposition to this decision.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: SPX +0.64% at 3379, DJIA +0.9% at 29,551, NDX +1% at 9613. SECTORS: Cons Disc +0.99%, Cons Stpl -0.04%, Energy +1.36 %, Financials +0.07%, Health +0.14%, Industrials +0.92%, Materials +0.52%, Real Estate +0.67%, Technology +1.06%, Communication Svs +1.25%, Utilities +0.02%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Molson Coors (TAP) initially opened +3.5% after its earnings report which beat top and bottom-line estimates, however throughout the session gains quickly reversed and closed ~4% lower. Lyft (LYFT) beat on top and bottom-line estimates however the stock ended the day almost 10% lower as analysts highlight it signalled no sign of turning a profit this year, unlike competitor Uber (UBER). Western Union (WU) was hit after its earnings report missed both EPS and revenue expectations.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Micron (MU) traded with solid gains following an upgrade at UBS, where the desk noted the time has finally arrived when MU can materially outperform over a sustained period, believing it is in a much stronger position in a better-positioned industry on the cusp of a cyclical upswing, and that DRAM should perform well in 2021. Elsewhere in the Semiconductor space, Qualcomm (QCOM) opened higher following an upgrade at Daiwa, who noted the potential QCOM has due to its 5G positioning. The energy sector drove gains in the SPX as oil prices rebounded today following the recent heavy declines. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) traded higher boosted by firmer oil prices but also gained on reports TDR capital is interested in its Speedway unit. Defensives (XLP, XLU, XLV) were the relative underperformers on Wednesday, XLP the only sector in the red as gains in TAP reversed course after opening with solid gains. Wynn (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were higher following an upgrade at UBS. Carnival (CCL) announced it is currently unable to determine the full financial impact of the coronavirus, but noted if it had to suspend Asia operations until the end of April, it would hit FY20 financial performance by USD 0.55-0.65/shr. BedBath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) were slammed after releasing preliminary Q4 SSS, which declined 5.4% due to declines in store traffic combined with inventory management issues, more promotional activity and markdowns.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> EUR continued to weaken amid a number of factors such as continued weakness in EU data which is leading to growth concerns, while German political woes also failed to provide any favour to the single currency. Desks have also highlighted the conditions for a carry trade continue to show as participants eye higher-yielding currencies, seemingly evident in EURCAD price action which continues to fall. Technical factors were also in play today with EURUSD seemingly held up by 1.6bln worth of option expiries between 1.0900/10. However, after the NY cut weakness continued and the cross breached 1.09 to the downside, and printed a multi-year low at 1.0877, with technicians eyeing 1.0864 as the next Fib support level. USD was firmer primarily driven by EUR weakness as data remained thin and Powell had nothing new to say. The DXY tested 99.00 to the upside before breaking above the key level in late trade, Scotia note that while risk appetite improves, it believes an overbought USD is prone to some corrective pressures. CAD firmer aided by the rebound in oil prices, and also likely as part of the EUR carry trade, USDCAD crossed 1.3250 to the downsie although currently resides at the figure heading into the final hour of trade. USDJPY crossed over 110 this morning after risk appetite improved at the European open, a level it resides around heading into Asia trade amid broad dollar strength. UBS highlight that “as correlations with core global risk assets and indicators of cyclical risk are alive and well”, JPY appears to be an ideal portfolio hedge due to long-term appreciation expectations and its inverse sensitivity risk. XAU saw relatively rangebound trade today with the precious metal trading in an 8 buck range but ending the session rather flat, if not slightly lower on greenback strength. NZD was the G10 outperformer following the RBNZ’s rate decision which signalled no further easing as it increased its forecast for its OCR to 1.1% from 0.9% in June 2021. AUD firmer in sympathy with its Antipodean counterpart. EMFX was mixed with continued weakness seen in TRY amid ongoing Syria conflict while higher oil prices doing little to help the Lira, which conversely supported RUB.</p>",

Desks have also highlighted the conditions for a carry trade continue to show as participants eye higher-yielding currencies, seemingly evident in EURCAD price action which continues to fall. Technical factors were also in play today with EURUSD seemingly held up by 1.6bln worth of option expiries between 1.0900/10. However, after the NY cut weakness continued and the cross breached 1.09 to the downside, and printed a multi-year low at 1.0877, with technicians eyeing 1.0864 as the next Fib support level. <strong>USD</strong> was firmer primarily driven by EUR weakness as data remained thin and Powell had nothing new to say. The DXY tested 99.00 to the upside before breaking above the key level in late trade. Scotia note that while risk appetite improves, it believes an overbought USD is prone to some corrective pressures. <strong>CAD </strong>firmer aided by the rebound in oil prices, and also likely as part of the EUR carry trade, USDCAD crossed 1.3250 to the downsie although currently resides at the figure heading into the final hour of trade. <strong>USDJPY</strong> crossed over 110 this morning after risk appetite improved at the European open, a level it resides around heading into Asia trade amid broad dollar strength. UBS highlight that “as correlations with core global risk assets and indicators of cyclical risk are alive and well”, JPY appears to be an ideal portfolio hedge due to long-term appreciation expectations and its inverse sensitivity risk. <strong>XAU</strong> saw relatively rangebound trade today with the precious metal trading in an 8 buck range but ending the session rather flat, if not slightly lower on greenback strength. <strong>NZD </strong>was the G10 outperformer following the RBNZ’s rate decision which signalled no further easing as it increased its forecast for its OCR to 1.1% from 0.9% in June 2021. <strong>AUD</strong> firmer in sympathy with its Antipodean counterpart. <strong>EMFX </strong>was mixed with continued weakness seen in <strong>TRY</strong> amid ongoing Syria conflict while higher oil prices doing little to help the Lira, which conversely supported <strong>RUB</strong>.</li></ul>",

Similar to Tuesday, the majority of the move happened in the overnight session, before finding its floor in early European trade. Desks note the selling was lead by real money as dealers sought concession ahead of the 10-year auction, in what was, more broadly, the most expensive since October. Nonetheless, the USD 27bln refunding auction was fairly decent, stopping through the 1.623% WI by 0.1bps, covered 2.58x (vs. six-auction average 2.41x), and dealers didn’t have to take down as much as usual, with both directs and indirects taking more than average. How much higher the 10-year yield can move in the near term remains up to debate, there are suggestions of algos/programme sellers “lurking” above 1.64% on the 10-year yield, a level which heavy gamma hedging took place last week, a level which could be tested if expectations move closer to that of a v-shaped recovery in the global economy post the coronavirus. By settlement, yields were higher across the curve with the 10-year yield at 1.63%, seeing the 2s10s widen by just under 1.5bps.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Energy outperformed on Wednesday alongside equities, with many citing the reported declining rate of new coronavirus helping the oil benchmarks push to the higher end of their February trading ranges; note a bearish EIA weekly report saw prices pare back somewhat. Oil prices were already on the front foot from the Asia session, ignoring a bearish private inventory report on Tuesday evening, before breaking higher as US participants came to their desks. Citigroup's energy analysts highlight the \"surge in RBOB gasoline on the back of some unplanned refinery outages, including a fire at Exxon Mobile’s 502k BPD Baton Rouge refinery, although production units don’t appear to have been involved.\" However, some added greenback strength and an acutely bearish EIA weekly report saw some profit-taking/concession: crude stocks (bbls) built a crushing 7.5mln, more than double expectations and the preliminary indications, while production rose by 100k BPD to 13.0mln BPD; however, the products both printed draws amid a ramp-up in refinery utilisation. Meanwhile, following the Russian Energy Ministry's meeting with domestic corporates to discuss the OPEC+ meeting/extended cut proposals, it was reported that no decision had yet been made, with Lukoil suggesting many were in favour for an extended cut to the end of Q2 but gave no mention of whether the group would support any deeper cuts as the OPEC JTC had recommended. Looking ahead, oil prices now stand at a key point, if global sentiment continues to warm amid failing coronavirus concerns, WTI and Brent could find themselves breaking their February highs of 52.20 and 56.77, respectively, and begin to pare back some of the heavy losses experienced in January - although a worsening global demand picture due to nCoV, in addition to an unsupportive OPEC, could limit further gains</p>",

Given that the short-end is pegged to Fed expectations, for now, flight to quality could boost demand for the belly of the curve, the bank concludes.</li></ul><p><strong>In terms of historical figures:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.869%, six-auction avg. 1.753%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 1.6bps, six-auction avg. 0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.45x, six-auction avg. 2.41x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 28.7%, six-auction avg. 26.7%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 16.1%, six-auction avg. 14.5%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 55.2%, six-auction avg. 58.8%)</li></ul><p><i>Bids are submitted by 18:00GMT with results submitted shortly afterwards</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar appears to have found a foothold and firm base to resume its upward trajectory after what seemed like a technically bearish formation and turning point on Tuesday. However, the <strong>DXY</strong>’s relatively swift recharge owes much to the inability of rival currencies to take advantage or extend gains beyond key chart/psychological levels, and it remains to be seen whether the index can clear 99.000 after stalling a whisker ahead of the round number yesterday (98.702-931 range so far vs 98.965 high on Tuesday). For the record, nothing new from Fed chair Powell or Daly and Harker in the run up to the 2nd semi-annual testimony for that matter, but there is still Kaplan to come.</p><p><strong>NZD/NOK/AUD/CNH/SEK</strong></p><p>Off best levels, but supportive RBNZ policy tailwinds are still keeping the Kiwi on course to top the major league, as Nzd/Usd consolidates above 0.6450 and Aud/Nzd hovers near the bottom of a circa 1.0400-90 band. In short, the OCR was held as widely if not quite unanimously anticipated, but guidance shifted to neutral from a more two-way stance via the statement and rate forecasts that now envisage a 10 bp hike by the middle of 2021 vs a 10 bp ease through Q1 next year previously. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd has tracked moves amidst broadly risk-on trade, but lagged like Usd/Cnh ahead of resistance around 0.6750 and 6.9500 respectively even though China’s health scare shows more signs of reaching a peak. Elsewhere, another rebound in oil has fuelled further Eur/Nok retracement and a dip through 10.0400, while Eur/Sek has finally crossed 10.5000, but more on Euro weakness rather than the Riksbank that essentially rolled out the same repo path that was laid in December and stuck to the rationale for maintaining ZIRP after the +25 bp normalisation.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP</strong></p><p>The next best G10s, as the Loonie also benefited from crude’s latest price comeback to test 1.3250 vs its US peer and Sterling maintained post-UK data momentum to get close to 1.3000 and technical resistance in the form of Cable’s 200 DMA, while breaching 0.8400 against the underperforming Eur.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Pound, mixed fortunes for the Franc again, as Usd/Chf sits closer to the upper end of 0.9771-41 parameters, but Eur/Chf just off multi-year lows within 1.0635-62 extremes on the broader common currency weakness noted above that pulled Eur/Usd under Tuesday’s sub-1.0900 trough and close to the 2019 nadir (1.0879 ahead of a key Fib at 1.0864). Similarly, the Yen struggled to hold above 110.00, but pared losses before major support seen at 110.23.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A rebuke from Russia over action in Syria before some conciliation via a desire to see both sides achieve aims without conflict piled more pressure on the Turkish Lira that breached 6.0500 vs the Dollar in response. However, the Hungarian Forint fared even worse at fresh record lows against the Euro after little impetus from NBH minutes underlining ongoing accommodation and awaiting CPI data tomorrow.</p>",

The broader sectors saw defensives underperform with Real Estate, Utilities and Consumer Staples the only sectors in negative territory. Healthcare, however, opened higher as Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) gained after it announced it is working on a coronavirus vaccine with the US HSS.

The possible effect of Coronavirus on neighbouring countries in OECD Asia Pacific is also accounted for.</li><li>OECD total product inventories rose by 22.2mln barrels MM in December to stand at 1.455bln barrels. This was 9.0mln barrels above the same time a year ago, but 8.8mln barrels lower than the latest five-year average.</li></ul><p><strong>CORONAVIRUS</strong></p><ul><li>Oil demand growth in China in 2020 is forecast to slow down, y-o-y, reflecting lower economic activities. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China necessitated a further downward revision to the country’s oil demand growth forecast compared to last month</li><li>Chinese oil demand is now revised down by 200k BPD in 1H20 from the previous monthly assessment, resulting in an overall downward revision of 400k BPD in global oil demand growth in 1H20 and hence a downward revision of 200k BPD for the whole year.

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.9%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equities are mostly higher [Eurostoxx 50 +0.6%] following on from a similar APAC session, which saw Japanese markets return from yesterday’s holiday and close with firm gains. Bourses are largely in the green with the exception of the SMI (-0.2%), led lower by heavyweights Roche (-0.7%), Nestle (-0.6%) and Novartis (-0.3%) - which together account for ~55% of SMI – as sectors reflect risk appetite (healthcare, consumer staples lag and utilities lag). In terms of individual movers – dismal earnings see ABN AMRO (-7.0%) at the foot of the pan-European index after net income and dividend printed sub-par, with interest income falling and impairments rising. On the flip side, Heineken (+6.2%) stands as a top Stoxx 600 gainer following their earnings in which net profit and consolidated beer volume topped estimates, leading to the best performance in over a decade. Kering (+2.2%) shares also benefit from their numbers after metrics beat estimates across the board including the much-watched Gucci Q4 comparable sales growth. Kering also noted that the uncertainties in China do not call into question the Co’s fundamentals in the luxury industry. Thus, European luxury stocks receive tailwinds: Swatch (+1.5%), Richemont (+1%) and LVMH (+0.6%) all trade higher in tandem.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD - </strong>The Kiwi is flying and leaving G10 rivals far behind on the back of another shift from the RBNZ towards ending its easing cycle. Nzd/Usd has rebounded sharply following February’s policy guidance tweaks and updated OCR projections that signal no change for the foreseeable future compared to 10 bp easing previously. In fact, the rate path is now pointing to a 1.10% benchmark price by mid-2021 vs 0.9% out to March next year last time, and the only caveat appears to be severe economic contagion from China’s virus. Nzd/Usd is now eyeing resistance ahead of 0.6500 from sub-0.6400 lows and the Aud/Nzd cross has snapped back towards 1.0400 following transitory forays just above 1.0500 of late. However, the Aussie is also outpacing its US peer that is largely consolidating after failing to extend its winning run when the DXY hit a brick wall inches before 99.000, as Aud/Usd probes firmer ground on the 0.6700 handle with some independent impetus from improved Westpac consumer confidence overnight.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/CAD/EUR - </strong>All benefiting from the aforementioned flagging Greenback, albeit to varying degrees, with Cable also capitalising on Tuesday’s UK GDP data rather than any dovish BoE nuances and extending recovery gains beyond 1.2980 towards 1.3000 and the 10 DMA that falls just shy of the big figure (1.2997). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp is hovering a few pips above 0.8400 as the single currency remains leggy around 1.0900 against the Buck after yet another Eurozone data miss via pan IP and Eur/Usd runs into headwinds at 1.0925. Note also, heavy option expiry interest between the round number and 1.0910 in 1.6 bn may be capping the headline pair ahead of the NY cut. Elsewhere, the Franc is still straddling 0.9750, but trending bullishly vs the Euro around a 1.0650 axis that prefaces multi-year peaks or troughs for the cross, while the Loonie is gleaning more underlying support from oil’s revival to hold above 1.3300 against its NA neighbour.</p><p><strong>SCANDI - </strong>In contrast to the RBNZ, nothing new at all emanated from the Riksbank’s latest policy meeting as the repo trajectory matched December’s (flat) profile and accompanying statement underlined the likelihood that zero percent will prevail until the end of the forecast horizon. Nevertheless, Eur/Sek has drifted down towards 10.5000 as none of the regular Board dissenters entered reservations and Governor Ingves reiterated the on hold message in the ensuing press conference. However, Eur/Nok has fallen further on the crude price rebound noted above to test bids/support in front of 10.0500.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Ongoing recovery gains across the region and the Rand only partially hampered by another SA data miss (retail sales), but no respite for the Lira as Turkish President Erdogan ramps up his verbal threats to repel attacks by Syrian Government sources to prevent the Try maintaining an attempt to regain 6.0000+ status.</p><p><strong>RBNZ kept the Official Cash Rate unchanged as expected at 1.00%. RBNZ noted that policy has time to adjust if needed, that low interest rates remain necessary</strong> and inflation is close to the mid-point. Furthermore, the RBNZ added that employment was at or slightly above maximum sustainable level and sees the overall impact from coronavirus will be of a short duration. Furthermore, the RBNZ adjusted forecasts of the rate path in which it sees OCR at 1.00% in June 2020 1.10% in June 2021 vs. Prev. forecasts of 0.9% through to March 2021. (Newswires) <strong>RBNZ Governor Orr said</strong> there are many signs household spending growth is increasing and noted that coronavirus is a risk which could have a larger impact although the central bank has time to respond, while it added they are looking at the assumption of 6-week disruption due to coronavirus and have taken half of the expected GDP growth for Q1 off the table in projections amid the coronavirus outbreak. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Riksbank kept rates unchanged at 0.0% as expected</strong>, additionally they did not make any changes to their repo path which sees rates on hold until 2022 where the path sees rates at 0.1%. The Riksbank did acknowledge that falling energy prices are expected to dampen inflation this year, after which, they will return to near target. As such, 2020 CPIF target was cut to 1.3% vs. December’s forecast of 1.7%. Subsequently, <strong>Governor Ingves stated it is hard to see a rate cut</strong> as falling inflation is predominantly on low energy prices.</p><p>Major FX option expiries for today's NY cut</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD<strong>: 1.0900-10 (1.6BLN),</strong> 1.0920 (327M), 1.0955-60 (700M), 1.0980 (250M)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/CHF: 0.9700 (1.1BLN)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUD/USD<strong>: 0.6700 (2.1BLN), 0.6750 (820M)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GBP/USD: 1.2890 (281M), 1.2925 (386M), 1.2975 (209M), <strong>1.3000 (820M), </strong>1.3020 (200M)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NZD/USD: <strong>0.6450 (500M)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/JPY: 109.00 (1BLN), <strong>110.00-05 (1.2BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A spirited if not quite compelling or complete comeback from worst levels by <strong>Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries</strong> as the 10 year debt futures recently rebounded to/towards 147.17, 131.14 and 130-30 vs 173.72, 133.82 and 130-20+ respectively amidst a modest fade/stall in EU stocks as a proxy for risk sentiment in general. The German benchmark may have forged some support via a solid 2030 offering, all things considered, but nowhere near as much as <strong>BTPs</strong> following bumper demand for Italy’s 2036 syndication with orders almost reaching Spanish record levels. Ahead, more issuance via the Usd32 bn 10 year sale, earnings and the 2nd instalment from Fed chair Powell after colleagues Harker and Daly.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES – OPEC Report will be released at 12:05GMT/07:05EST</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front-month futures continue their upward trajectories with the contracts piggy-backing the broad risk appetite across the market, amid the slowing rate of COVID-19 cases/deaths coupled with reports of positive therapies and resumptions in Chinese operations. WTI Mar’20 futures reside north of USD 50.50/bbl with prices eyeing USD 51.00/bbl ahead of potential resistance at the USD 51.50/bbl mark, which coincides with the 7th Feb high. Brent Apr’20 futures came across mild resistance in early EU trade at USD 55.38/bbl (7th Feb high) ahead of further potential resistance around USD 55.55/bbl (6th Feb high). On the OPEC front, a definite OPEC+ meeting date remains in question, with desks noting that the longer we wait, the more likely that the meeting will take place in March as opposed to late-February. Russian Energy Minister Novak will today be meeting with domestic oil companies to discuss Moscow’s stance on deeper/prolonged output reductions. Elsewhere, yesterday’s APIs, which showed a larger-than-forecast build (+6mln vs. Exp. +3mln), did little to provide sustained pressure in prices as sentiment underpins the benchmarks – participants will be on the lookout to see if the weekly DoE numbers align with those of the API. Yesterday also saw the release of the EIA STEO ahead of today’s OPEC monthly oil report. The STEO cut 2020 oil demand growth by 310k BPD, downgraded US crude output forecasts and noted the uncertainty surrounding the virus outbreak, again little sustained reaction. Next up, OPEC’s monthly report will garner interest as this is the report that will encapsulate coronavirus forecasts as well as OPEC output since the December meeting. In terms of metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> trades lacklustre on either side of the 21 DMA (USD ~1566/oz), in-fitting with the current risk appetite. Copper prices remain supported by the risk tone but within yesterday’s ranges awaiting the next catalyst. Finally, <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> futures hit three-week highs as coronavirus cases/deaths slowed and following a 22.4% YY drop in Vale’s Q4 iron ore production.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 7th Jan) +6.0mln (exp. +3.0mln, prev. +4.18mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p>",

Bourses are largely in the green with the exception of the SMI (-0.2%), led lower by heavyweights Roche (-0.7%), Nestle (-0.6%) and Novartis (-0.3%) - which together account for ~55% of SMI – as sectors reflect risk appetite (healthcare, consumer staples lag and utilities lag). In terms of individual movers – dismal earnings see ABN AMRO (-7.0%) at the foot of the pan-European index after net income and dividend printed sub-par, with interest income falling and impairments rising. On the flip side, Heineken (+6.2%) stands as a top Stoxx 600 gainer following their earnings in which net profit and consolidated beer volume topped estimates, leading to the best performance in over a decade. Kering (+2.2%) shares also benefit from their numbers after metrics beat estimates across the board including the much-watched Gucci Q4 comparable sales growth. Kering also noted that the uncertainties in China do not call into question the Co’s fundamentals in the luxury industry. Thus, European luxury stocks receive tailwinds: Swatch (+1.5%), Richemont (+1%) and LVMH (+0.6%) all trade higher in tandem.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD </strong>- The Kiwi is flying and leaving G10 rivals far behind on the back of another shift from the RBNZ towards ending its easing cycle. Nzd/Usd has rebounded sharply following February’s policy guidance tweaks and updated OCR projections that signal no change for the foreseeable future compared to 10 bp easing previously. In fact, the rate path is now pointing to a 1.10% benchmark price by mid-2021 vs 0.9% out to March next year last time, and the only caveat appears to be severe economic contagion from China’s virus. Nzd/Usd is now eyeing resistance ahead of 0.6500 from sub-0.6400 lows and the Aud/Nzd cross has snapped back towards 1.0400 following transitory forays just above 1.0500 of late. However, the Aussie is also outpacing its US peer that is largely consolidating after failing to extend its winning run when the DXY hit a brick wall inches before 99.000, as Aud/Usd probes firmer ground on the 0.6700 handle with some independent impetus from improved Westpac consumer confidence overnight.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/CAD/EUR </strong>- All benefiting from the aforementioned flagging Greenback, albeit to varying degrees, with Cable also capitalising on Tuesday’s UK GDP data rather than any dovish BoE nuances and extending recovery gains beyond 1.2980 towards 1.3000 and the 10 DMA that falls just shy of the big figure (1.2997). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp is hovering a few pips above 0.8400 as the single currency remains leggy around 1.0900 against the Buck after yet another Eurozone data miss via pan IP and Eur/Usd runs into headwinds at 1.0925. Note also, heavy option expiry interest between the round number and 1.0910 in 1.6 bn may be capping the headline pair ahead of the NY cut. Elsewhere, the Franc is still straddling 0.9750, but trending bullishly vs the Euro around a 1.0650 axis that prefaces multi-year peaks or troughs for the cross, while the Loonie is gleaning more underlying support from oil’s revival to hold above 1.3300 against its NA neighbour.</p><p><strong>SCANDI </strong>- In contrast to the RBNZ, nothing new at all emanated from the Riksbank’s latest policy meeting as the repo trajectory matched December’s (flat) profile and accompanying statement underlined the likelihood that zero percent will prevail until the end of the forecast horizon. Nevertheless, Eur/Sek has drifted down towards 10.5000 as none of the regular Board dissenters entered reservations and Governor Ingves reiterated the on hold message in the ensuing press conference. However, Eur/Nok has fallen further on the crude price rebound noted above to test bids/support in front of 10.0500.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Ongoing recovery gains across the region and the Rand only partially hampered by another SA data miss (retail sales), but no respite for the Lira as Turkish President Erdogan ramps up his verbal threats to repel attacks by Syrian Government sources to prevent the Try maintaining an attempt to regain 6.0000+ status.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A spirited if not quite compelling or complete comeback from worst levels by <strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> as the 10 year debt futures recently rebounded to/towards 147.17, 131.14 and 130-30 vs 173.72, 133.82 and 130-20+ respectively amidst a modest fade/stall in EU stocks as a proxy for risk sentiment in general. The German benchmark may have forged some support via a solid 2030 offering, all things considered, but nowhere near as much as BTPs following bumper demand for Italy’s 2036 syndication with orders almost reaching Spanish record levels. Ahead, more issuance via the Usd32 bn 10 year sale, earnings and the 2nd instalment from Fed chair Powell after colleagues Harker and Daly.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures continue their upward trajectories with the contracts piggy-backing the broad risk appetite across the market, amid the slowing rate of COVID-19 cases/deaths coupled with reports of positive therapies and resumptions in Chinese operations. WTI Mar’20 futures reside north of USD 50.50/bbl with prices eyeing USD 51.00/bbl ahead of potential resistance at the USD 51.50/bbl mark, which coincides with the 7th Feb high. Brent Apr’20 futures came across mild resistance in early EU trade at USD 55.38/bbl (7th Feb high) ahead of further potential resistance around USD 55.55/bbl (6th Feb high). On the OPEC front, a definite OPEC+ meeting date remains in question, with desks noting that the longer we wait, the more likely that the meeting will take place in March as opposed to late-February. Russian Energy Minister Novak will today be meeting with domestic oil companies to discuss Moscow’s stance on deeper/prolonged output reductions. Elsewhere, yesterday’s APIs, which showed a larger-than-forecast build (+6mln vs. Exp. +3mln), did little to provide sustained pressure in prices as sentiment underpins the benchmarks – participants will be on the lookout to see if the weekly DoE numbers align with those of the API. Yesterday also saw the release of the EIA STEO ahead of today’s OPEC monthly oil report. The STEO cut 2020 oil demand growth by 310k BPD, downgraded US crude output forecasts and noted the uncertainty surrounding the virus outbreak, again little sustained reaction. Next up, OPEC’s monthly report will garner interest as this is the report that will encapsulate coronavirus forecasts as well as OPEC output since the December meeting. In terms of metals, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> trades lacklustre on either side of the 21 DMA (USD ~1566/oz), in-fitting with the current risk appetite. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain supported by the risk tone but within yesterday’s ranges awaiting the next catalyst. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures hit three-week highs as coronavirus cases/deaths slowed and following a 22.4% YY drop in Vale’s Q4 iron ore production.</p>",

Although US equities opened at new ATHs, participants weren’t eager to push yields any higher, following on from Monday where yields pushed lower despite an equity rally. The curve structure was little changed too, with some desks noting the 3-year auction as keeping the front/belly end weighted: the auction tailed the 1.392% WI by 2bps and Dealers took a larger share than usual, although it was covered 2.56x, higher than the six-auction average. By settlement, yields up to the 10-year maturity were higher by just over 4bps, while the 30-year was only 3bps higher. US T-note futures (H20) settled 11+ ticks lower at 131.00.</p><p><strong>Fed's Kashkari (Voter, Dove)</strong> stated interest rates are slightly accommodative and are not providing much of a boost, while he suggested that it seems like the battles between the US and China on trade are not getting worse but noted that coronavirus is a downside risk for China and if it hits the US in scale it would also be a downside risk here. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said that China’s economy is expected to slow noticeably this quarter due to the coronavirus, while the best case for the US is a soft landing following the recent rate cuts as housing and other interest rate-sensitive sectors rebound. Bullard also stated it is appropriate to remain steady on rates and that progress is needed to be seen on inflation, while he would welcome inflation readings above 2%. Furthermore, Bullard noted that monetary policy currently feels a \"little bit accommodative\" and that rate normalisation of previous years will \"pay dividends\" as the Fed has scope to react to a downturn.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) traded positive with the biggest movers driven by earnings releases including the largest of the Big 4 banks CBA which despite posting a decline in H1 net, still beat expectations resulting to outperformance in the top-weighted financials sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was also lifted as it played catch up on return from holiday and with SoftBank sitting on double-digit percentage gains following the federal court approval of the merger between its unit Sprint with T-Mobile. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were kept afloat but with the mainland initially indecisive after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations for a neutral daily position and as participants contemplated over the ongoing outbreak in which the number of cases and death toll continued to mount albeit at a slower pace with the additional number of cases at 2015 which is the lowest since January 30th. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid the gains in Japanese stocks and following the mixed results at the 10yr inflation-indexed auction, while pressure was also seen in New Zealand bonds in the aftermath of the less dovish statement from the RBNZ.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher but with gains limited as coronavirus fears linger and following a lack of conviction on Wall St. where US stocks notched fresh record highs at the open before gradually fading the moves throughout the day. ASX 200 (+0.6%) is positive with the biggest movers driven by earnings releases including the largest of the Big 4 banks CBA which despite posting a decline in H1 net, still beat expectations resulting to outperformance in the top weighted financials sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) is also lifted as it plays catch up on return from holiday and with SoftBank sitting on double-digit percentage gains following the federal court approval of the merger between its unit Sprint with T-Mobile. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch) are kept afloat but with the mainland indecisive after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations for a neutral daily position and as participants contemplate over the ongoing outbreak in which the number of cases and death toll continues to mount albeit at a slower pace with the additional number of cases at 2015 which is the lowest since January 30th.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady and consolidates after having recently pulled back from resistance just shy of the 99.00 level, with the greenback finding little to spur price action from Fed Chair Powell who stuck to the script in the first day of his testimony to Congress, while the ongoing New Hampshire Democrat Primary results have also failed to provide any major surprises with Bernie Sanders leading as expected given the home advantage with him being the Senator from the neighbouring state of Vermont. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is stuck within yesterday’s tight range and GBP/USD holds above the 1.2950 level after the recent better than expected preliminary Q4 GDP data, while USD/JPY finds mild support from the risk appetite. Antipodeans were the biggest gainers with NZD/USD surging after the RBNZ rate decision in which it kept rates unchanged as expected and revised its forecast for the rate path in which it now sees the OCR at 1.1% in June 2021 vs. Prev. forecasts of 0.9% through to March 2021.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid the gains in Japanese stocks and with participants sidelined ahead of a 10yr inflation-indexed auction, while pressure was also seen in New Zealand bonds in the aftermath of the less dovish statement from the RBNZ.</p>",
