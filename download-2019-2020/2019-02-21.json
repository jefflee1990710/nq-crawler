Bullard was referring to the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes, which still see a rate hike as possible should the economy evolve as expected. Bullard also differed from the Fed&rsquo;s Clarida, by stating that he believes that the December rate hike was not warranted. Bullard argued that the Fed was near the end of its hiking cycle, as well as its policy of reducing bonds it holds on its balance sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB minutes provided little fresh insight with policymakers concluding that and decision taken on the TLTRO should not be taken too hastily and should serve policy objectives (obviously). Further, the account revealed that the Bank perceives that current market pricing is in-line with their current guidance; something that Draghi alluded to in January. From a growth perspective, central bankers believed that near-term growth momentum is likely to be weaker than earlier expected, the extent of this conviction will likely be a key source of focus for the March staff economic projections. Following the release, ING concluded that &ldquo;the minutes of the January European central bank meeting show that the ECB has become more concerned about the economic outlook but needs more time, like everybody these days, to assess if the downswing is temporary or something more permanent&rdquo;. Perhaps of more relevance for the market was this week&rsquo;s commentary from various policymakers with ECB&rsquo;s Chief Economist Praet on Monday stating that if Euro area growth were to slow more sharply, guidance on rates could be adapted as well as complemented by other measures. Praet went on to suggest that he expects near-term projections to be revised lower, again, this will be a key source of focus for the March meeting. Later in the week, Praet stated that the Governing Council will not necessarily make a decision on a new TLTRO at the March meeting, adding that there are many ways to design the TLTRO. As such, next month might see more of a prelim discussion on the matter rather than a formal policy announcement. Elsewhere, VP de Guindos suggested that rates are still low and the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for a long while yet. With this in mind, asides from macro projections at the March meeting, focus will also be placed on whether nor not the Bank perceives their current &lsquo;at least through Summer 2019&rsquo; guidance is stale with markets currently only pricing a circa 47.5% chance of a 10bps hike in the deposit rate this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Newsflow was generally positive, with reports the US and China are beginning to draft outline commitments. As trade talks continued today in Washington, it was reported China are to propose an additional USD 30bln in US agriculture imports; US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said China&rsquo;s proposals are contingent on there being a &#39;grand deal&#39;. US Secretary of State Pompeo spoke positively saying that there had been real progress in US/China trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU diplomats said on Thursday that the UK and EU are moving towards a &quot;parallel declaration&quot; or &quot;interpretive instrument&quot; on the Irish border to break the impasse. Furthermore, European Commission VP Timmermans said the is EU ready to work with the UK govt to improve the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) or political declaration; but repeated the EU line that the WA is the best possible option, he also said the UK should stop the &ldquo;pipe dream&rdquo; of it avoiding EU rules whilst not having an Irish border. These comments rose the sentiment of a deal being reached, however, Irish Foreign Minister Coveney reminded us that there is no Brexit deal yet, but it is possible to get one by the end of march; another EU official said there will be further talks next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DURABLE GOODS:</strong> December&#39;s durable goods data grew 1.2% MM, slightly short of the 1.50% expectation. Taking the volatile transport component out, there was weakness across the main categories; &quot;Core orders were also disappointing, down 0.7%, following a downwardly revised 1.0% decline in the prior month -- a sign that weaker global growth prospects may be curbing business orders,&quot; Oxford Economics wrote. &quot;Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments excluding aircrafts -- source data for the business equipment component of GDP -- were up a more modest 0.5% after posting a 0.2% decline in November. The trend for core shipments continues to slow to 3.7% y/y.&quot; Oxford Economics says that taken together, &quot;the data confirm that business investment momentum continues to cool and underscore that growth during the final quarter of the year likely slowed to a mid-2% pace.&quot; And looking ahead, Oxford Economics argues that the slower investment trajectory will remain in place as the support from fiscal stimulus, energy prices and global demand diminish while tighter financial conditions and trade uncertainty weigh on investment decisions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EXISTING HOME SALES: </strong>Came in a touch below expectations in January, at 4.94mln, extending the run of recent soft home buying activity, and crucially, the third consecutive decline. &ldquo;While winter months are notoriously volatile and difficult to interpret due to large seasonal factors, home buying activity continues to trend lower,&rdquo; Wells Fargo said, &ldquo;overall sales are down 8.5% from the 5.40mln unit pace registered a year ago.&rdquo; Wells says that the recent softness is a reflection of the deteriorating affordability seen throughout 2018, along side low inventories, rising home prices and higher mortgage rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUROZONE PMIs:</strong> There was a divergence between the January&#39;s manufacturing PMI (falling to 49.2 from 50.2, which analysts said reflects ongoing weakness in the global industrial sector) and the services PMI (52.3 from 51.2). &quot;This divergence fits our priors which are that external sector weakness continues to weigh on the EZ economy, while the domestic economy is resilient,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote. The net impact, however, was that the services segment managed to push the composite measure higher (51.4 from 51.0), beating the consensus 51.1; and in combination with the ZEW&#39;s forward-looking components (released earlier in the week) as well as better than expected EZ consumer confidence (released Weds), offers some hopes that the tone of incoming data will stabilise in the Eurozone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BOC Gov Poloz reaffirmed the need to move rates up to neutral over time, but says path is very uncertain; said he would be data dependent. &quot;Governor Poloz&#39;s speech on monetary policy offered little insight into the outlook, focusing instead on high-level limitations of the Bank&#39;s current framework,&quot; TD securities wrote. &quot;There were few references to the outlook which added little beyond what was delivered in the January MPR,&quot; and the bank also noted that Poloz repeated that current policy is accommodative and that the Bank will look to move the overnight rate into the neutral range over time, subject to the evolution of data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) settles $0.20 lower at $56.96/bbl; Brent (J9) settles $0.01 lower at $67.07. </strong>The crude complex drifted lower on Thursday in the wake of disappointing economic data as well as the DOE reporting a fifth consecutive week of rising US crude inventories. Sentiment dampened going into the open as the Eurozone market manufacturing flash PMIs printed a miss on expectations, with Europe&rsquo;s power house Germany especially disappointing, this weighed on equities and oil prices. Growth concerns were escalated even further after US Durable Goods and the US Philly Fed Business Index both missed expectations too. The US DOE released its inventory data today &ndash; a day later than usual due to Monday&rsquo;s holiday &ndash; where crude stocks built by 3.67mln barrels, greater than both the expected build of 3.08mln and the APIs predicted build of 1.3mln; Cushing built by 3.41mln barrels;&nbsp; distillates drew less than expected at 1.52mln; gasoline drew greater than expected at 1.45mln. DOE also reported crude production rising to 12mln BPD from 11.9mln BPD previously. Although losses were limited, the backdrop of the OPEC+ supply cut deal still remains a strong tailwind for the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.35% at 2775, NDX -0.38% at 7035, DJI -0.40% at 25851. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -1.53%, Materials -0.41%, Industrials -0.41%, Cons Discretionary -0.20%, Cons Staples +0.29%, Healthcare -0.87%, Financials -0.43%, Tech +0.05%, Telecoms -0.63%, Utilities +0.75%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Agilent Technologies (A) dipped on the open on Thursday after providing soft guidance for 2019, despite beating top and bottom line estimates. China-based NetEase (NTES) nosedived after missing on revenue estimates. Hormel Foods (HRL) underperformed on disappointing guidance. TechnipFMC (FTI) tanked after reporting a Q4 loss as well as missing on revenue. Albemarle (ALB), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH), Copart (CPRT) and Equifax (EFX) all traded higher on reporting their earnings. DowDuPont (DWDP) underperformed on revising its FY19 sales guidance lower. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) opened in the red after Senator Murray issued the co. with subpoenas over allegations of asbestos in its talcum powder. Nike (NKE) was another underperformer after a basketball player injured himself after his Nike trainer split mid-game. Tesla (TSLA) dived after losing a recommendation from Consumer Reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 8 TICKS LOWER AT 121-29. </strong>Yields were higher by 3-5bps across the curve, by settlement, with volumes picking up overnight following the FOMC meeting minutes, as well as news that the US and China were drafting agreements on issues related to their trade dispute. The European day lent further selling bias with traders optimistic that a no deal Brexit can be avoided. Once again, a corporate supply slate added some selling pressure, with some chunky investment grade deals launching on Thursday. The European close saw some profit taking, into the 30-year TIPS auction, which stopped through and saw better cover. The steepening continued into the close, with major curve spreads steepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The broad Dollar and index have witnessed a bit more downside in wake of the latest FOMC minutes, and delayed US durable goods data did little to help, missing expectations, while the more timely Philly Fed survey was bleaker with the business index and new orders components both negative. The DXY dipped to 96.351 at one stage, and close to 96.265 Fib support vs 96.677 on initial less dovish perceptions of the aforementioned Fed release (mainly based on the fact that more rate hikes in 2019 were not ruled out).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Not much respite for the beleaguered Aussie, or its Kiwi peer as a combination of Westpac&rsquo;s aggressive call on the RBA (predicting 2 eases later this year, in Q3 and Q4) and reports of China blocking coal imports more than offset significantly stronger than expected labour data overnight (the class action suit vs banks was also a factor). Aud/Usd is struggling to keep tabs on the 0.7100 level, and Aud/Nzd looks equally precarious just above 1.0400 even though Nzd/Usd has seen contagion and declined too (currently circa 0.6820). Back to the Aud, RBA&#39;s Lowe is on the agenda ahead and the Governor had a huge impact last time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie also failed to derive much bullish momentum from upbeat macro news as Canadian wholesale trade defied forecasts for a decline and ADP NFP rebounded strongly, with the ongoing consolidation in crude prices perhaps weighing alongside technical factors given the 200 DMA sitting just below the 1.3162 Usd/Cad base at 1.3154. Note, BoC&#39;s Poloz added some two-way volatility, though didn&rsquo;t say anything particularly new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> A beneficiary partly thanks to the depressed Greenback and latest weaker PBoC Usd/Cny reference rate, but Usd/Jpy only pulled back incrementally from recent peaks to around 110.58. Note, chart support just ahead of 110.50 at 110.52 in the form of the 10 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR,</strong> <strong> GBP, CHF</strong>:All relatively unchanged vs the Buck, but not before choppy moves within ranges as the single currency tested 1.1365 highs and 1.1320 lows several times and weathered some very mixed Eurozone flash PMIs. Meanwhile, the Pound was just as volatile through the now all too familiar Brexit toing and froing in 1.3025-95 parameters, but ultimately underpinned by reports from the UK and EU about further progress towards some kind of compromise on the Irish backstop that could come via a parallel declaration or an interpretive instrument, but unlikely to be delivered this week. The Franc has now peered at parity again, but looks locked in around 1.1350 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n",

Sentiment dampened going into the open as the Eurozone market manufacturing flash PMIs printed a miss on expectations, with Europe&rsquo;s power house Germany especially disappointing, this weighed on equities and oil prices. Growth concerns were escalated even further after US Durable Goods and the US Philly Fed Business Index both missed expectations too. The US DOE released its inventory data today &ndash; a day later than usual due to Monday&rsquo;s holiday &ndash; where crude stocks built by 3.67mln barrels, greater than both the expected build of 3.08mln and the APIs predicted build of 1.3mln; Cushing built by 3.41mln barrels; &nbsp;distillates drew less than expected at 1.52mln; gasoline drew greater than expected at 1.45mln. DOE also reported crude production rising to 12mln BPD from 11.9mln BPD previously. Although losses were limited, the backdrop of the OPEC+ supply cut deal still remains a strong tailwind for the market.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar and index have witnessed a bit more downside in wake of the latest FOMC minutes as delayed US durable goods data missed forecasts in headline and ex-transport terms, while the more timely Philly Fed survey was even more bleak with the business index and new orders components both negative. The DXY dipped to 96.351 at one stage, and close to 96.265 Fib support vs 96.677 on initial less dovish perceptions of the aforementioned Fed release (mainly based on the fact that more rate hikes in 2019 were not ruled out).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much respite for the beleaguered Aussie, or its Kiwi peer as a combination of Westpac&rsquo;s aggressive call on the RBA (predicting 2 eases later this year, in Q3 and Q4) and reports of China blocking coal imports more than offset significantly stronger than expected labour data overnight. Aud/Usd is struggling to keep tabs on the 0.7100 level and Aud/Nzd looks equally precarious just above 1.0400 even though Nzd/Usd has seen contagion and declined too (currently circa 0.6820). Back to the Aud, RBA&#39;s&nbsp;Lowe is on the agenda ahead and the Governor had a huge impact last time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie also failed to derive much bullish momentum from upbeat macro news as Canadian wholesale trade defied forecasts for a decline and ADP NFP rebounded strongly, with the ongoing consolidation in crude prices perhaps weighing alongside technical factors given the 200 DMA sitting just below the 1.3162 Usd/Cad base at 1.3154. Note, BoC&#39;s Poloz due to speak later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On course to finish Thursday&rsquo;s EU session on top of the G10 pile, partly thanks to the depressed Greenback and latest weaker PBoC Usd/Cny reference rate, but Usd/Jpy only pulled back incrementally from recent peaks to around 110.58. Note, chart support just ahead of 110.50 at 110.52 in the form of the 10 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relatively unchanged vs the Buck, but not before choppy moves within ranges as the single currency tested 1.1365 highs and 1.1320 lows several times and weathered some very mixed Eurozone flash PMIs. Meanwhile, the Pound was just as volatile through the now all too familiar Brexit toing and froing in 1.3025-95 parameters, but ultimately underpinned by reports from the UK and EU about further progress towards some kind of compromise on the Irish backstop that could come via a parallel declaration or an interpretive instrument, but unlikely to be delivered this week. The Franc has now peered at parity again, but looks locked in around 1.1350 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other major laggards, with Eur/Nok towards the top of its 9.7370-7915 range against the backdrop of stagnating oil prices and a somewhat disappointing Norwegian energy investment report, while Eur/Sek is also nearer the peak of a 10.6310-5590 band following the IMF&rsquo;s annual report that revealed a downward revision to Sweden&rsquo;s 2019 GDP forecast and urged the Riksbank to hold off from another repo rate hike.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar and index have witnessed a bit more downside in wake of the latest FOMC minutes as delayed US durable goods data missed forecasts in headline and ex-transport terms, while the more timely Philly Fed survey was even more bleak with the business index and new orders components both negative. The DXY dipped to 96.351 at one stage, and close to 96.265 Fib support vs 96.677 on initial less dovish perceptions of the aforementioned Fed release (mainly based on the fact that more rate hikes in 2019 were not ruled out).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much respite for the beleaguered Aussie, or its Kiwi peer as a combination of Westpac&rsquo;s aggressive call on the RBA (predicting 2 eases later this year, in Q3 and Q4) and reports of China blocking coal imports more than offset significantly stronger than expected labour data overnight. Aud/Usd is struggling to keep tabs on the 0.7100 level and Aud/Nzd looks equally precarious just above 1.0400 even though Nzd/Usd has seen contagion and declined too (currently circa 0.6820). Back to the Aud, RBA&#39;s&nbsp;Lowe is on the agenda ahead and the Governor had a huge impact last time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie also failed to derive much bullish momentum from upbeat macro news as Canadian wholesale trade defied forecasts for a decline and ADP NFP rebounded strongly, with the ongoing consolidation in crude prices perhaps weighing alongside technical factors given the 200 DMA sitting just below the 1.3162 Usd/Cad base at 1.3154. Note, BoC&#39;s Poloz due to speak later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On course to finish Thursday&rsquo;s EU session on top of the G10 pile, partly thanks to the depressed Greenback and latest weaker PBoC Usd/Cny reference rate, but Usd/Jpy only pulled back incrementally from recent peaks to around 110.58. Note, chart support just ahead of 110.50 at 110.52 in the form of the 10 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relatively unchanged vs the Buck, but not before choppy moves within ranges as the single currency tested 1.1365 highs and 1.1320 lows several times and weathered some very mixed Eurozone flash PMIs. Meanwhile, the Pound was just as volatile through the now all too familiar Brexit toing and froing in 1.3025-95 parameters, but ultimately underpinned by reports from the UK and EU about further progress towards some kind of compromise on the Irish backstop that could come via a parallel declaration or an interpretive instrument, but unlikely to be delivered this week. The Franc has now peered at parity again, but looks locked in around 1.1350 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other major laggards, with Eur/Nok towards the top of its 9.7370-7915 range against the backdrop of stagnating oil prices and a somewhat disappointing Norwegian energy investment report, while Eur/Sek is also nearer the peak of a 10.6310-5590 band following the IMF&rsquo;s annual report that revealed a downward revision to Sweden&rsquo;s 2019 GDP forecast and urged the Riksbank to hold off from another repo rate hike.</p>\r\n",

Gilts are now just off another new Liffe low of 123.59, which effectively coincides with chart support ahead of 123.47, while Bunds have breached previously flagged downside tech levels in front of 166.00, but not tested the next area between 165.86-84 after stemming the tide at 165.90, and not really reacting to ECB minutes for the record, which were a rehash of the policy statement in keeping with the FOMC version yesterday. Turning to the currency markets, Sterling is looking ripe to test 1.3100 again vs a relatively soft Usd and Eur/Gbp has retreated below 0.8700 on the aforementioned Brexit developments.</p>\r\n",

This helped the region shake off the early cautious tone brought on by another marginal performance of their US counterparts and a mixed-perceived FOMC minutes. ASX 200 (+0.7%) was underpinned by strength in Financials as well as outperformance in Consumer Discretionary after Wesfarmers shares rallied post-earnings, while the trade hopes inspired a turnaround for the Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) which was initially dampened by currency effects and after Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data slipped into contraction territory for the 1st time since August 2016. Elsewhere, the KOSPI (+0.1%) lagged with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics lacklustre after it unveiled its ground-breaking foldable smartphone which comes with an eye-watering price of nearly USD 2000, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were also initially choppy before the trade-related optimism provided a rising tide across the region. Finally, 10yr JGBs found support from the early cautious tone and after disappointing Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data, but then reversed course as risk sentiment improved and after weaker results in the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations but offered CNY 71.9bln through pledged supplementary lending operations.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are mixed [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%] in spite of the firmer trade seen in Asia following reports that negotiators are drafting MOU&rsquo;s. The FTSE 100 (-0.6%) is underperforming its peers, weighed on by BAE Systems (-7.0%) and Centrica (-11.8%) following earnings for both Co&rsquo;s; additional downward pressure is applied by Anglo American (-0.1%) after earnings and Glencore (-1.5%) who are in the red following a tax demand and mine production cut. Sectors are mixed, with some mild outperformance in consumer discretionaries. Other notable movers include Bouygues (+3.4%) near the top of the Stoxx 600 as their FY profit came in above the prior. Also performing well after earnings are Barclays (+0.2%), with the Co. stating they are considering additional returns which include buybacks. Of note are Maersk (-9.6%) in the red after stating that 2019 guidance is subject to considerable uncertainty from trade risks, also the Co. and Maersk Drilling are to trade separately from April 4th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - A really rough night for the Antipodean Dollars, and especially the Aud that failed to glean any lasting benefit from a robust if not stellar January jobs report, as Westpac delivered an extremely dovish RBA outlook with not just one, but two rate cuts pencilled in for this year (August and November). Aud/Usd recoiled from just over 0.7200 in response and then reversed even more sharply on headlines reporting that China was blocking coal imports as several ports including the main Dalian hub, hitting lows under 0.7100. Meanwhile, Aud/Nzd fell from around 1.0490 to circa 1.0400, but is holding above the base as Nzd/Usd suffers knock-on losses towards 0.6800 vs 0.6875 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR - All on a softer footing vs the Greenback, as the DXY recovers from its post-FOMC minutes lows and with the overall take from the release not as dovish as many anticipated or were positioned for (end of balance sheet reduction by end 2019 favoured by most, but prospect of further rate normalisation this year left on the table) &ndash; index straddling 96.500 vs 96.390 at one stage. The Loonie is close to the bottom of a 1.3207-1.3163 range, while the Franc is back below parity, albeit just, and the single currency is pivoting 1.1350 amidst mixed Eurozone flash PMIs, volatile trade on stops and near term technical with some hefty option expiries also thrown in for good measure. Specifically, 1.1365, 1.1371-73 represent resistance, with the latter zone incorporating Wednesday&rsquo;s high and the 30 DMA, while 1.2 bn rolls off at the 1.1300 strike and almost 3 bn at 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY - Relative G10 outperformers as Cable holds firmly above 1.3000, after a few wobbles, and not far from overnight peaks just over 1.3100 following a record UK public finance haul in January, a well received 2057 Gilt auction and comments from Chancellor Hammond suggesting the EU is showing some willingness to budge on the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, the Jpy has pared some losses within a 110.60-87 range in wake of another drop in the PBoC&rsquo;s mid-point Usd/Cny fixing rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - The Scandi Crowns are both back under pressure, with Eur/Nok nudging above 9.7900 against the backdrop of stagnating oil prices and a somewhat disappointing Norwegian energy investment report, while Eur/Sek has rebounded to 10.6000+ from around 10.5600 following the IMF&rsquo;s annual report that revealed a downward revision to Sweden&rsquo;s 2019 GDP forecast and urged the Riksbank to hold off from another repo rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As US Treasuries remain under pressure post-Fed minutes and ahead of a very busy afternoon agenda, Bunds and Gilts have succumbed to renewed selling pressure, and with the former just off a marginal new Eurex low of 166.13 (-38 ticks on the day). Meanwhile, Gilts are on the retreat from a similarly slender fresh Liffe peak of 123.95 forged on the back of a strong DMO auction and with some earlier support from a record surplus in the Government&rsquo;s coffers for the first month of 2019. However, the aforementioned bearish UST tone and curve steepening appears more compelling for core debt, and with the German benchmark also conscious that Italian BTPs have rebounded relatively well from 126.86 to trade a full point higher in recent trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.1%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices are largely unchanged after a mixed overnight session, with both Brent and WTI trading within a narrow USD 1/bbl range. Yesterday&rsquo;s delayed API release showed a crude oil inventories build of 1.26mln barrels, although this was less than the expectation for a 3.1mln barrel build. EIA&rsquo;s delayed weekly report is to be published later today where expectations are for a crude stock build of 3.1mln, which would make it the fifth consecutive week of builds. Elsewhere, reports show that Venezuela are paying large premiums for Russian and European fuel imports due to a limited number of available sellers, following US sanctions against PDVSA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of note SSB&rsquo;s (Statistics Norway) first quarter oil investment survey confirms the solid outlook for oil investments, with the 2019 nominal capital spending on oil and gas extraction implies growth of 13.8% vs. 2018&rsquo;s actual level. 2019 spending forecasts have been lowered slightly due to lower exploration spending; although, SEB argue that the prior figure was already high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.2%) is weaker after trading largely sideways overnight, with the yellow metal approaching the bottom of its USD 10/oz range. Elsewhere, Barrick Gold have outlined a deal reached with the Tanzania government, which features a USD 300mln payment, regarding disputes with Acacia Mining. Separately, China&rsquo;s northern Dalian port bans imports of Australian coal and are to cap overall imports for the year at 12mln tonnes; this ban follows other Chinese ports taking 40 days to clear Australian coal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Dalian customs bans Australian coal imports indefinitely and sets 12mln tons overall coal import quota for this year, according to sources.

The FTSE 100 (-0.4%) is underperforming its peers, weighed on by BAE Systems (-6.8%) and Centrica (-11.3%) following earnings for both Co&rsquo;s; additional downward pressure is applied by Anglo American (-0.6%) after earnings and Glencore (-1.5%) who are in the red following a tax demand and mine production cut. Sectors are mixed, with some mild outperformance in consumer discretionaries. Other notable movers include Bouygues (+3.2%) near the top of the Stoxx 600 as their FY profit came in above the prior. Also performing well after earnings are Barclays (+3.6%), with the Co. stating they are considering additional returns which include buybacks. Of note are Maersk (-10.3%) in the red after stating that 2019 guidance is subject to considerable uncertainty from trade risks, also the Co. and Maersk Drilling are to trade separately from April 4th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - A really rough night for the Antipodean Dollars, and especially the Aud that failed to glean any lasting benefit from a robust if not stellar January jobs report, as Westpac delivered an extremely dovish RBA outlook with not just one, but two rate cuts pencilled in for this year (August and November). Aud/Usd recoiled from just over 0.7200 in response and then reversed even more sharply on headlines reporting that China was blocking coal imports as several ports including the main Dalian hub, hitting lows under 0.7100. Meanwhile, Aud/Nzd fell from around 1.0490 to circa 1.0400, but is holding above the base as Nzd/Usd suffers knock-on losses towards 0.6800 vs 0.6875 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR - All on a softer footing vs the Greenback, as the DXY recovers from its post-FOMC minutes lows and with the overall take from the release not as dovish as many anticipated or were positioned for (end of balance sheet reduction by end 2019 favoured by most, but prospect of further rate normalisation this year left on the table) &ndash; index straddling 96.500 vs 96.390 at one stage. The Loonie is close to the bottom of a 1.3207-1.3163 range, while the Franc is back below parity, albeit just, and the single currency is pivoting 1.1350 amidst mixed Eurozone flash PMIs, volatile trade on stops and near term technical with some hefty option expiries also thrown in for good measure. Specifically, 1.1365, 1.1371-73 represent resistance, with the latter zone incorporating Wednesday&rsquo;s high and the 30 DMA, while 1.2 bn rolls off at the 1.1300 strike and almost 3 bn at 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY - Relative G10 outperformers as Cable holds firmly above 1.3000, after a few wobbles, and not far from overnight peaks just over 1.3100 following a record UK public finance haul in January, a well received 2057 Gilt auction and comments from Chancellor Hammond suggesting the EU is showing some willingness to budge on the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, the Jpy has pared some losses within a 110.60-87 range in wake of another drop in the PBoC&rsquo;s mid-point Usd/Cny fixing rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - The Scandi Crowns are both back under pressure, with Eur/Nok nudging above 9.7900 against the backdrop of stagnating oil prices and a somewhat disappointing Norwegian energy investment report, while Eur/Sek has rebounded to 10.6000+ from around 10.5600 following the IMF&rsquo;s annual report that revealed a downward revision to Sweden&rsquo;s 2019 GDP forecast and urged the Riksbank to hold off from another repo rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As US Treasuries remain under pressure post-Fed minutes and ahead of a very busy afternoon agenda, Bunds and Gilts have succumbed to renewed selling pressure, and with the former just off a marginal new Eurex low of 166.13 (-38 ticks on the day). Meanwhile, Gilts are on the retreat from a similarly slender fresh Liffe peak of 123.95 forged on the back of a strong DMO auction and with some earlier support from a record surplus in the Government&rsquo;s coffers for the first month of 2019. However, the aforementioned bearish UST tone and curve steepening appears more compelling for core debt, and with the German benchmark also conscious that Italian BTPs have rebounded relatively well from 126.86 to trade a full point higher in recent trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (U/C) prices are largely unchanged after a mixed overnight session, with both Brent and WTI trading within a narrow USD 1/bbl range. Yesterday&rsquo;s delayed API release showed a crude oil inventories build of 1.26mln barrels, although this was less than the expectation for a 3.1mln barrel build. EIA&rsquo;s delayed weekly report is to be published later today where expectations are for a crude stock build of 3.1mln, which would make it the fifth consecutive week of builds. Elsewhere, reports show that Venezuela are paying large premiums for Russian and European fuel imports due to a limited number of available sellers, following US sanctions against PDVSA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of note SSB&rsquo;s (Statistics Norway) first quarter oil investment survey confirms the solid outlook for oil investments, with the 2019 nominal capital spending on oil and gas extraction implies growth of 13.8% vs. 2018&rsquo;s actual level. 2019 spending forecasts have been lowered slightly due to lower exploration spending; although, SEB argue that the prior figure was already high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.4%) is weaker after trading largely sideways overnight, with the yellow metal approaching the bottom of its USD 10/oz range. Elsewhere, Barrick Gold have outlined a deal reached with the Tanzania government, which features a USD 300mln payment, regarding disputes with Acacia Mining. Separately, China&rsquo;s northern Dalian port bans imports of Australian coal and are to cap overall imports for the year at 12mln tonnes; this ban follows other Chinese ports taking 40 days to clear Australian coal.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A really rough night for the Antipodean Dollars, and especially the Aud that failed to glean any lasting benefit from a robust if not stellar January jobs report, as Westpac delivered an extremely dovish RBA outlook with not just one, but two rate cuts pencilled in for this year (August and November). Aud/Usd recoiled from just over 0.7200 in response and then reversed even more sharply on headlines reporting that China was blocking coal imports as several ports including the main Dalian hub, hitting lows under 0.7100. Meanwhile, Aud/Nzd fell from around 1.0490 to circa 1.0400, but is holding above the base as Nzd/Usd suffers knock-on losses towards 0.6800 vs 0.6875 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All on a softer footing vs the Greenback, as the DXY recovers from its post-FOMC minutes lows and with the overall take from the release not as dovish as many anticipated or were positioned for (end of balance sheet reduction by end 2019 favoured by most, but prospect of further rate normalisation this year left on the table) &ndash; index straddling 96.500 vs 96.390 at one stage. The Loonie is close to the bottom of a 1.3207-1.3163 range, while the Franc is back below parity, albeit just, and the single currency is pivoting 1.1350 amidst mixed Eurozone flash PMIs, volatile trade on stops and near term technical with some hefty option expiries also thrown in for good measure. Specifically, 1.1365, 1.1371-73 represent resistance, with the latter zone incorporating Wednesday&rsquo;s high and the 30 DMA, while 1.2 bn rolls off at the 1.1300 strike and almost 3 bn at 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative G10 outperformers as Cable holds firmly above 1.3000, after a few wobbles, and not far from overnight peaks just over 1.3100 following a record UK public finance haul in January, a well received 2057 Gilt auction and comments from Chancellor Hammond suggesting the EU is showing some willingness to budge on the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, the Jpy has pared some losses within a 110.60-87 range in wake of another drop in the PBoC&rsquo;s mid-point Usd/Cny fixing rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scandi Crowns are both back under pressure, with Eur/Nok nudging above 9.7900 against the backdrop of stagnating oil prices and a somewhat disappointing Norwegian energy investment report, while Eur/Sek has rebounded to 10.6000+ from around 10.5600 following the IMF&rsquo;s annual report that revealed a downward revision to Sweden&rsquo;s 2019 GDP forecast and urged the Riksbank to hold off from another repo rate hike.</p>\r\n",

The catalysts, no real extra dovish guidance from last night&rsquo;s FOMC minutes and a welcome or much needed recovery in the French PMIs vs more misery for German manufacturers offset by faster services growth. Note, Bunds retreated further in response, to 166.15 (-36 ticks), but held above support protecting 166.00 around 166.02, at the first time of asking at least. Back to Liffe and Thursday&rsquo;s UK agenda, public sector finances will be scrutinised before attention turns to the DMO for 2057 issuance (Gbp1.5 bn) that is now receiving some concession and then BoE&rsquo;s Haldane at noon, although the prospect of new guidance looks remote given the ongoing Brexit uncertainty.</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds retain an underlying bid amidst more underperformance in BTPs and another potential flashpoint between Italy and EU when the latter releases its latest official review of the 2019 budget next week. Moreover, Eurozone flash PMIs could keep buyers interested unless there is a material improvement and any further dovish vibes via the ECB minutes may also be supportive. Note, the Eurex range so far had been 166.40-67 vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 166.51 close.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.7%) was underpinned by strength in Financials as well as outperformance in Consumer Discretionary after Wesfarmers shares rallied post-earnings, while the trade hopes inspired a turnaround for the Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) which was initially dampened by currency effects and after Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data slipped into contraction territory for the 1st time since August 2016. Elsewhere, the KOSPI (+0.1%) lagged with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics lacklustre after it unveiled its ground-breaking foldable smartphone which comes with an eye-watering price of nearly USD 2000, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were also initially choppy before the trade-related optimism provided a rising tide across the region.

The initial indecisive risk tone consigned USD/JPY to within this week&rsquo;s tight range, while CNH briefly strengthened below 6.7000 against the greenback following a firmer reference rate setting and amid US-China trade hopes. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was tumultuous as the initial gains spurred by stronger than expected Employment Change, was later wiped out after Westpac&rsquo;s Bill Evans revised RBA forecasts in which Westpac now sees a total of 2 cuts for this year and with selling exacerbated after source reports that China&rsquo;s Dalian customs banned Australian coal imports indefinitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Change (Jan) 39.1K vs. Exp. 15.0K (Prev. 21.6K).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which WTI crude futures marginally extended on gains after several bullish headlines for oil including expectations of higher OPEC+ compliance, Nigeria&rsquo;s acceptance of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s oil cut plan and a narrower than expected build in headline API crude inventories. Elsewhere, gold traded sideways amid a quiet greenback and mixed-perceived FOMC minutes, while copper slightly pulled back from recent advances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (Feb 15) +1.260mln vs. Exp. +3.200mln (Prev. -0.998mln).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At settlement, the Treasury curve was slightly negative, with newswires attributing the moves to comments in the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes that signal 21019 rate hikes are still possible. Earlier in the session there was some focus on a 10s30s steepening trade (18k in the TYH9 vs 4k in the ultra longs). At settle, the curve was slightly steeper, with analysts noting 2s10s spread seems to be capped by its 50 day moving average. Some had also attributed higher yields to a slate of investment grade corporate supply, which pressured the long-end. US T-note futures (H9) settled 2 ticks lower at 122-05.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is negotiating with the EU and will impose tariffs if there is not a deal.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Vice Chair Clarida (voter) does not think that a change in Fed policy statements represents a U-Turn, while he added the December rate hike was not a mistake and that it is unclear how much of a US growth slowdown we are seeing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Daly (non-voter, dove) said we are very near neutral level for rates and wants patience on rates until she sees inflation increasing faster. Furthermore, Daly also commented she sees more headwinds such as slower global growth, uncertainty and tighter financial conditions, but added there is nothing on the radar that shows US is declining into a recession. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said global growth deceleration is likely to continue and that the Fed should pause rate hikes in order to see how economic uncertainty looks. Kaplan further commented that the weaker business outlook is the reason for his caution on rates and that the yield curve is signalling sluggish expectations for growth. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.7%) was underpinned by strength in Financials as well as outperformance in Consumer Discretionary after Wesfarmers shares rallied post-earnings, while the trade hopes inspired a turnaround for the Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) which was initially dampened by currency effects and after Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data slipped into contraction territory for the 1st time since August 2016. Elsewhere, the KOSPI (+0.1%) lagged with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics lacklustre after it unveiled its ground-breaking foldable smartphone which comes with an eye-watering price of nearly USD 2000, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were also initially choppy before the trade-related optimism provided a rising tide across the region. Finally, 10yr JGBs found support from the early cautious tone and after disappointing Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data, but then reversed course as risk sentiment improved and after weaker results in the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) have diverged with the Australian benchmark underpinned by strength in Financials and with Consumer Discretionary the biggest gaining sector as Wesfarmers shares rally post-earnings, while Tokyo trade is dampened by currency effects and after Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data slipped into contraction territory for the 1st time since August 2016. Elsewhere, the KOSPI is subdued with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics pressured after it unveiled its ground-breaking foldable smartphone which comes with an eye-watering price of nearly USD 2000, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are choppy as the region mulls earnings, upcoming US-China senior-level trade talks and after the PBoC refrained from conducting Reverse Repos but instead announced a Pledged Supplementary Lending operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY trades quiet overnight but is ultimately firmer in the aftermath of the FOMC Minutes, while its major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD remaining near the prior day&rsquo;s lows and with GBP/USD also despondent after its recent failed attempt on the 1.3100 handle. Elsewhere, the indecisive risk tone has contained USD/JPY to this week&rsquo;s tight ranges, and AUD/USD is tumultuous as the initial gains spurred by stronger than expected Employment Change was later wiped out after Westpac&rsquo;s Bill Evans revised RBA forecasts in which they now see a total of 2 cuts for this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher with prices supported amid the lacklustre Tokyo risk sentiment and after disappointing Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data.</p>\r\n",
