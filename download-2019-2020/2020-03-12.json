Risk sentiment was very fragile as the day got underway, with US equity futures hitting limit down in pre-markets, while cash trade also ran into a Level 1 circuit breaker for the second time this week. Elsewhere, the ECB’s policy announcement ultimately disappointed with Lagarde once again piling the onus onto fiscal authorities (who are due to talk tomorrow) and there was some fleeting optimism after the NY Fed announced boosted repo operations in which it expanded the collateral it will accept and the tenors. The first operation itself was undersubscribed, though some analysts noted that it was a rushed announcement, and more participants may get involved in Friday’s operations. SPX -9.5% at 2481, NDX -9.3% at 7264, DJI -10.0% at 21201.</p><p>A choppy day for Treasuries as initial overnight gains were reversed amid investors fleeing to cash from major asset classes. The risk sell-off after the Trump presser overnight commenced the bid in government debt, although as US participants arrived, The TPLEX was offered amid poor liquidity; equity futures reaching limit down prior to the cash open only added to the panic. Desks noted the ongoing profit-taking in the long end, on top of likely demand for cash amid the market turmoil. However, the selling found some short-lived reprieve after the NY Fed announced its USD 1.5trln of additional repo operation offerings over Thursday and Friday, as well as its new Treasury purchase schedule which now extends the whole way out the curve. Although yields shortly began rising again, where the 30-year auction, which tailed the 1.28% WI by a sizeable 4bps, catalysed the move. By settlement, yields had risen by around 4bps in the 10-year, 2bps in the 30-year, while 2s, 3s, and 5s were little changed. US T-note futures (H0) settled 8 ticks lower at 1363-28+.</p>",

Risk sentiment was vey fragile as the day got underway, with US equity futures hitting limit down in pre-markets, while cash trade also ran into a Level 1 circuit breaker for the second time this week. Markets have clearly been underwhelmed by the announced measures fro authorities so far. Travel names were beaten down sharply amid Trump’s EU travel ban (particularly airlines LUV, AAL, UAL, DAL). The ECB’s policy announcement ultimately disappointed, with Lagarde once again piling the onus onto fiscal authorities (who are due to talk tomorrow). There was some fleeting optimism after the NY Fed announced boosted repo operations (see Treasury wrap below), expanding the collateral it will accept, and the tenors (many framed it as ‘QE’ though the Fed would probably take exception to that). The first operation itself was undersubscribed, though some analysts noted that it was a rushed announcement, and more participants may get involved in Friday’s operations.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP: </strong>US President Trump overnight announced travel restrictions on passengers arriving from the EU for 30-days. He also said that this implied restrictions on trade and cargo, which forced the White House to walk back in his remarks, clarifying that it only applied to passengers and not goods imports. President Trump also said he was using his emergency authority to take measures on paid sick leave, small business lending, and a deferral of some April tax deadlines. Trump also urged Congress to pass a payroll tax holiday, although analysts said this erred more on politics than a direct virus response. And that, traders said, was part of the reason why risk assets dropped heavily in early trade. A lack of policy clarity and cohesion has spooked investors, while the announced fiscal measures do not stack up against market expectations.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>The ECB refrained from succumbing to market pricing, which had been looking for a 10bps rate cut to the deposit rate, with a 35% chance of a deeper 20bps cut. However, the central bank kept rates unchanged. Instead, it tweaked existing measures, making the terms of the existing TLTRO-III programme more favourable, with the rate on these operations (which run until June 2021) to be 25bps below the main refi rate, and in some cases, 25bps below the deposit rate. Further, it also unveiled a new series of LTROs which will 'bridge the gap' until the TLTRO-III operations resume in June. Additionally, the Governing Council also opted to expand the size of its Asset Purchase Programme by EUR 120bln until the end of the year; later it was clarified there will be no fixed monthly purchase amount, in order to give the Bank as much flexibility as possible in their operations. Note, the ECB maintained its forward guidance on rates and reinvestments. At her press conference, President Lagarde was quick to stress the need for accompanying measures from fiscal authorities, and at one stage, went as far as to say that \"nobody should expect any central bank to be a first responder during a crisis.\" Lagarde noted that indicators pointed to a considerable worsening of the economic outlook, and that risks are clearly skewed to the downside (vs. her previous guidance of \"less pronounced\"). NOTE: growth and inflation projections were disregarded due to the cut-off date for their submission. During the press conference, the Lagarde was pressed on how the Governing Council arrived at its decision; Lagarde explained that it was unanimous, and that more stimulus measures could yet be implemented, and interestingly (given the decision to hold rates unchanged today), the ECB was not at the reversal rate, and there was still scope for rates to be lowered further. However, looking ahead, given the tone of today’s press conference, it is hard to see how forthcoming the ECB will be with further measures, unless Eurozone fiscal authorities come to the table with more meaningful support. Elsewhere, given the logistical impacts posed by COVID-19 this has impaired the progress of the strategic review and as such, an announcement is now not likely due until next year. Overall, the ECB has clearly disappointed some in the market looking for more aggressive action and a managing of the current market volatility (BTPs tanked after Lagarde stated that the Bank is “not here to close spreads”). Pantheon Macroeconomics went as far as to say that \"markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but.\" However, the messaging from Frankfurt is clear: fiscal authorities need to step up to the plate; whether this will be forthcoming or not, remains to be seen. Following the meeting the latest sources stated no policymaker proposed a rate cut, nor a different amount of QE than the EUR 120bln agreed.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 RESPONSE: </strong>The ECB’s stimulus package consisted of a tweak to its TLTRO-III, increased APP by EUR 120bln until the year end, while Lagarde stated there is room to cut rates if necessary. On the fiscal side, the US announced a travel ban on the EU for 30 days, while debates between GOP’s and Democrats continue to debate a package which both agree is needed, although the nuances are finding disagreement. Elsewhere, Spain approved a EUR 25bln coronavirus package for social services amidst the coronavirus outbreak, in fitting with Italy. Meanwhile, EU economic commissioner Gentiloni said the bloc would reveal a coronavirus package on Friday, adding that coordination between the US and EU is what is needed; on specifics, Gentiloni said the EU would tweak state aid rules to aid companies. Additionally, France's Macro said he would on Friday discuss a G7 initiative with US President Trump.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 1.48 LOWER AT USD 31.50; BRENT (K0) SETTLES USD 2.57 LOWER AT USD 33.22: </strong>Energy markets had another down day on Thursday, alongside other major assets, as participants move into cash in severe virus-induced volatility. The benchmarks saw a leg lower overnight post the Trump presser and trundled lower throughout the session. Aside from dire risk appetite, headwinds for bulls remain acutely elevated still as Saudi and Russia begin to ramp up their production as part of a price war. Further to the point, Russia’s Gazprom Neft said they will attempt to reach maximum oil output potential, adding that producers have not discussed returning to the OPEC+ deal and stating not to overestimate the role of the OPEC+ decision. Elsewhere, due to the virus, the OPEC+ JTC meeting scheduled for March 18th in Vienna is unlikely to occur, sources reported.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Two Americans and one Brit were killed in a military camp in Iraq late on Wednesday; the camp is known to host US military personnel. Later reports suggested that US forces had since carried out retaliatory airstrikes near the Iraq-Syria border. US Central Command confirmed the attacks and that they killed 2 Americans, which were likely conducted by Shia militia groups – noting that Kataib Hezbollah is the only group known to have conducted an attack on this scale, according to Politico. The US Central Command also said that Iran must understand it will take responsibility for what its militias do.</p><p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>Governor Kuroda discussed with PM Abe the recent financial moves, noting the BoJ is responding as appropriate by providing liquidity and buying assets. Meanwhile, the latest source reports stated the Central Bank is likely to strengthen stimulus at its meeting next week, by conducting a more active stance on buying assets, although it is unlikely to deepen negative rates without a jump in the JPY. Ahead of the meeting multiple source reports have been seen, yesterday, it stated the BoJ is likely to ease monetary policy next week to prevent market volatility from affecting business sentiment; increasing ETF buying seen as among the likely options, However, prior to that report, others intimated that expanding ETFs is not an option.</p><p><strong>* US REPO OPERATIONS: </strong>The NY Fed announced and offered a USD 500bln three-month repo operation on Thursday, the longest and largest term it has yet offered, and announced it would hold another again on Friday alongside a separate USD 500bln one-month term. Thereafter, the NY Fed will hold three- and one-month operations for 500bln on a weekly basis for the remainder of the monthly schedule. The offerings mark a massive ramp up from the NY Fed’s presence in the funding market and should theoretically provide a cushion for primary dealers getting swamped with Treasury holdings that need access to cash – USD 78.4bln bids submitted in the 3-month term, out of the offered 500bln, shows dealers have a lot more cash to tap from the Fed for funding. Furthermore, the Desk announced its USD 60bln of Treasury purchases would now be carried out across a wider range of Treasuries (further out the curve), which will further drawdown on bank’s holdings, reducing funding pressures. The offerings initially spawned a chunky bid in the equity complex, almost halving their eye-gorging losses, although the appetite was short-lived as equities returned to their lows in the latter part of the session.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 8 TICKS LOWER AT 1363-28+. </strong>A choppy day for Treasuries as initial overnight gains were reversed amid investors fleeing to cash from major asset classes. The risk sell-off after the Trump presser overnight commenced the bid in government debt, although as US participants arrived, The TPLEX was offered amid poor liquidity; equity futures reaching limit down prior to the cash open only added to the panic. Desks noted the ongoing profit-taking in the long end, on top of likely demand for cash amid the market turmoil. However, the selling found some short-lived reprieve after the NY Fed announced its USD 1.5trln of additional repo operation offerings over Thursday and Friday, as well as its new Treasury purchase schedule which now extends the whole way out the curve. Although yields shortly began rising again, where the 30-year auction, which tailed the 1.28% WI by a sizeable 4bps, catalysed the move. By settlement, yields had risen by around 4bps in the 10-year, 2bps in the 30-year, while 2s, 3s, and 5s were little changed.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -9.5% at 2481, NDX -9.3% at 7264, DJI -10.00% at 21201. <strong>Sectors: </strong>Health care -7.4%, telecoms -8.9%, communication -9.2%, staples -9.2%, materials -9.6%, discretionary -9.8%, IT -9.8%, utilities -10.2%, industrials -10.4%, financials -10.7%, energy -12.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) were among one of the top Dow decliners falling 14% after: a downgrade from JPM, reports it is to separate wiring bundles and that lawmakers passed a measure that gets rid of a significant tax break. All sectors are trading with losses greater than 5% with energy and financials worse off once again, while Health Care “outperformed”, falling over 5%. Dollar General (DG) reported strong earnings, although still traded lower given the broader market sell off. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and UAL were the latest names to announce drawing down credit lines. Eli Lilly (LLY) is reportedly joining the race to develop a COVID-19 treatment. Apache (APA) were hit after it cut its planned 2020 capital investment from 1.6-1.9bln to 1-1.2bln, noting over the upcoming weeks it will reduce its Permian rig count to zero; it also announced a dividend cut to USD 0.025/shr from USD 0.25/shr. Carl Icahn increased his stake in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) to 9.9% from 2.5% at the end of 2019. Verizon (VZ) announced it is increasing its capital guidance range from USD 17-18bln to USD 17.5-18.5bln in 2020, meanwhile Apple (AAPL) are reportedly set to be fined on Monday by French authorities over anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> DXY a strong outperformer, rising from 96.0 at the lows to above 98 as demand for dollars continues to rise. USDJPY: Despite the risk environment the cross reclaimed 105 to the upside amid the heavy bout of dollar strength, and more suggestions of BOJ easing. XAU sold-off to below USD 1600, with analysts suggesting a demand for dollars was forcing liquidations. EUR Fell back to 1.1050 amid broad dollar strength adding to the single currency woes, adding to that, ECB largely disappointed, though President Lagarde announced there was still room for rate cuts if necessary, noting the lower bound has not yet been reached. AUD and NZD both succumbed to the broader risk sentiment, and the huge USD rally, with the former shrugging of massive stimulus announced by the government. EURNOK surged, with the NOK pressured by sliding oil prices, ahead of the Norges bank meeting next week, where expectations for easing are growing. In EMFX, the strength of the Buck made its presence felt; BRL firmed, however, amid more intervention from the BCB. MXN hit record lows against the buck which spurred the Banxico to announce a USD 2bln FX hedge auction, which provided some support to the peso. RUB another day weaker after a fall in oil prices.</p>",

The benchmarks saw a leg lower overnight post the Trump presser and trundled lower throughout the session. Aside from dire risk appetite, headwinds for bulls remain acutely elevated still as Saudi and Russia begin to ramp up their production as part of a price war. Further to the point, Russia’s Gazprom Neft said they will attempt to reach maximum oil output potential, adding that producers have not discussed returning to the OPEC+ deal and stating not to overestimate the role of the OPEC+ decision. Elsewhere, due to the virus, the OPEC+ JTC meeting scheduled for March 18th in Vienna is unlikely to occur, sources reported.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Perhaps the limited or half-hearted bounce after the ECB defied money market expectations by maintaining benchmark rates unlike several G10 peers was telling, but the single currency subsequently gave up another 2 big figures against the Buck to probe any form of underlying bids ahead of 1.1050. The catalyst appeared to be a line from President Lagarde during the Q&amp;A leaving the door open for further easing if needed, but in truth it could have been more pronounced disappointment over the policy measures that were taken to counter the greater economic risk posed by COVID-19. To recap, a new LTRO was announced to bridge the gap through to June’s TLTRO, and both at more favourable rates of up to 25 bp below the -50 bp depo rate, while the existing APP remit was raised by Eur120 bn via a temporary envelope that will be available for the rest of 2020. However, the Euro’s descent also coincided with an acceleration of broad risk aversion and severe peripheral underperformance, as BTPs tanked alongside Bonos and even semi-core OATs, bank stocks and bourses as a whole.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>It’s been relatively measured and at least partly due to the frailty of others, but the Greenback has extended its recovery from post-Fed emergency ease lows amidst widespread selling or liquidation of non-Usd assets to free up cash. Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>has completed a 200+ tick round trip between 96.006-98.330 parameters, while even the ‘so called’ safer havens are succumbing to the Dollar’s seemingly irresistible pull.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/GBP/CHF/JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>All getting swept aside in late EU trade, as the Aussie loses grip of 0.6300, Kiwi teeters on the brink of 0.6100 and Cable pulls back further from post-BoE peaks to under 1.2550. Meanwhile, the Franc has reversed from 0.9350+ to circa 0.9550, while pivoting 1.0550 vs the Euro after the SNB refused to comment on the ECB’s policy actions pending its scheduled review next Thursday and the Yen followed suit within a 103.11-105.85 band in wake of latest ‘sourced’ BoJ reports about potential stimulus at its March meeting. Last but not least, the Loonie put up a fight for a while before listing vs its US counterpart and approaching 1.3900.</p><p><strong>SCAND/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Even more pain for the Nok, Sek and EM entourage as concerns about coronavirus contagion and a collapse in commodity prices (crude complex and precious metals including Gold hit hard as bullion lost Usd1600+/oz status) more than offset various efforts to try and soften the blow, like the BCB raising its daily FX swap op by Brl2 bn.</p>",

In contrast, BTPs and fellow periphery bonds have recoiled in disappointment and EZ banks have dragged the likes of the Dax deeper into negative territory, while the Euro has been whippy just above 1.1200 vs the Dollar albeit mostly firmer on the lack of no conventional easing. Accordingly, the DXY has slipped back under 97.000 and still awaiting a concrete US coronavirus support bill from Congress.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>(1) <strong>Additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) will be conducted, temporarily, to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area financial system</strong>. Although the Governing Council does not see material signs of strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the banking system, these operations will provide an effective backstop in case of need. They will be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the average rate on the deposit facility. The LTROs will provide liquidity at favourable terms to bridge the period until the TLTRO III operation in June 2020.</li><li>(2) In <strong>TLTRO III, considerably more favourable terms will be applied during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 to all TLTRO III operations outstanding during that same time</strong>. These operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. Throughout this period, the interest rate on these TLTRO III operations will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations. For counterparties that maintain their levels of credit provision, the rate applied in these operations will be lower, and, over the period ending in June 2021, can be as low as 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility. Moreover, the maximum total amount that counterparties will henceforth be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations is raised to 50% of their stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019. In this context, the Governing Council will mandate the Eurosystem committees to investigate collateral easing measures to ensure that counterparties continue to be able to make full use of the funding support.</li><li>(3) <strong>A temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of €120 billion will be added until the end of the year</strong>, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes. In combination with the existing asset purchase programme (APP), this will support favourable financing conditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty.</li><li>The Governing Council <strong>continues to expect net asset purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates</strong>, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.</li><li>(4) The <strong>interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% </strong>respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.</li><li>(5) <strong>Reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation</strong>.</li><li>Further details on the precise terms of the new operations will be published in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 CET.</li><li>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.</li></ul>",

The meeting takes place against a backdrop of severe economic uncertainty in which the full extent of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown. However, containment efforts across the continent have certainly impaired economic activity and as such, heightened calls for stimulus from the Governing Council. It remains to be seen whether the ECB will adopt a wait-and-see approach or unveil supportive measures, which could include rate reductions, expansion of the APP, adjustments to tiering thresholds, sweetening of the terms of existing TLTROs, financing measures for SMEs.</p>",

President Trump announced to suspend all travel from the EU to the US for 30 days which does not apply to the UK and he unveiled several relief measures including support for small businesses, the deferral of some tax payments and called on Congress for immediate payroll tax relief, although these failed to appease markets and the travel restrictions subsequently dragged <strong>EURO STOXX 50 futures</strong> lower by as much as 8%. <strong>ASX 200 (-7.4%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-4.4%)</strong> slumped with energy and commodity-related stocks front running the broad losses in Australia which saw the index post its worst decline since 2008 despite the government announcement of measures valued at AUD 17.6bln in response to the outbreak, while the Japanese benchmark collapsed on the weight of the JPY inflows and languished firmly below the 19k level where the BoJ flagged it would incur losses on ETF holdings. <strong>Hang Seng (-3.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.5%)</strong> conformed to the negative tone amid the global rout and after weaker than expected Chinese lending data, but with losses in the mainland at a lesser extent as China’s coronavirus updates continued to show a moderation in additional cases. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured at the open and briefly fell below 154.00 on initial spill over selling from USTs, although Japanese bond prices then briefly reversed some of the losses as the sell-off in stocks worsened, before selling resumed once again in the aftermath of the 20yr JGB auction which showed weaker results across all metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

APAC stocks suffered hefty losses overnight, with the Aussie index ending the session over 7.5% lower, whilst Japan’s Nikkei gave up the key 19k handle and some more. Meanwhile, the sentiment reverberated in US and EU equity futures with the former trickling lower to trade at/near their respective 5% limit downs (Full details of levels available on the headline feed), futures across the pond fare no better. In terms of cash markets, European stocks show broad-based losses to the tune of 5.5-7.0% [Eurostoxx 50 -5.5%] with losses of similar magnitude reflected across sectors, although defensive fare slightly better than the cyclicals. Zooming into the sectors, EU Travel &amp; Leisure underperforms its peers after US President Trump announced a 30-day travel ban to Europe. As such, the likes of Norwegian Air Shuttle (-21%), Lufthansa (-9.9%), Air-France (-11.0%), easyJet (-5.4%) all under pressure alongside cruise names. Financial names meanwhile bear the brunt of the low-yield environment; Barclays (-8.9%), Deutsche Bank (-8.3%), Commerzbank (-8.8%), BNP Paribas (-7.0%), UBS (-6.2%). In terms of individual movers, Nestle (-3.7%) failed to gain impetus from source reports that it is progressing with the sale of its China unit Yinlu Foods for ~USD 1bln. AstraZeneca (-4.0%) underperforms vs. the sector after its Phase III trial for Cediranib did not meet its primary endpoint.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - Although the Dollar is on a somewhat mixed footing against major counterparts and the US Treasury curve has flipped back into bull-steepening mode, the DXY has bounced firmly from overnight lows and back above 96.500 to breach Fib resistance at 96.695 by virtue of heftier gains vs high beta, activity, risk and even yield rivals, not to mention even more pronounced appreciation relative to floundering EM currencies. On that note, even the recently resilient YUAN is succumbing to the latest bout of safe-haven positioning irrespective of latest reports that nCoV has peaked and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak is returning to normal, as Usd/Cnh crosses the psychological 7.0000 mark again.</p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie has pulled back further towards 0.6400 and through 1.0300 in Kiwi cross terms amidst renewed risk-off trade, and hardly getting any relief from a substantial fiscal injection overnight, while its Antipodean peer has fallen in sympathy from 0.6300+ to sub-0.6250 territory awaiting the RBNZ for more independent impetus and more immediately NZ manufacturing PMI tonight.</p><p>NOK/SEK/GBP/EUR - Also on the backfoot, with Eur/Nok soaring beyond 11.0000 to another new ATH circa 11.1675 amidst a deeper retracement in crude prices and calls for the Norges Bank to cut the benchmark depo rate by 50 bp next week. Eur/Sek lagging on less dovish Riksbank vibes and mixed Swedish inflation data, while Sterling is back down near early March lows (Cable around 1.2750 and Eur/Gbp 0.8800+) in wake of yesterday’s emergency BoE ease and UK budget excesses. However, the Euro has unwound more post-Fed rate cut strength vs the Greenback in the run up to the ECB amidst high uncertainty over the likely policy adjustments given elevated anticipation for something big like last September’s multi-faceted salvo (check out the Newsquawk Research Suite for a full preview of the March policy meeting that comes with updated Staff forecasts). Eur/Usd has lost grip of 1.1300 and 1.1250 to probe technical support between 1.1239-13 that spans a Fib retracement level.</p><p>JPY/CAD/CHF - Relative G10 outperformers or at least displaying a degree of resistance to the Buck’s ongoing revival, as the Yen holds above 104.00, albeit off best levels following yet more talk about imminent or impending BoJ stimulus to supplement Japanese Government measures. Meanwhile, the Loonie is trying to contain losses within a 1.3821-3752 band against the backdrop of renewed pressure on oil and the Franc is firm, though contingent on the SNB’s reaction to what unfolds in Frankfurt via the ECB.</p><p>EM - As noted above, broad and hefty losses for regional currencies due to well documented negative factors, but with the Rouble and Mexican Peso particularly weak due to crude correlations</p><p>Notable FX Expires, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: 1.1200-10 (850M), 1.1245-50 (470M). <strong>1.1295-1.1300 (1.2BLN),</strong> 1.1325 (730M), 1.1350 (785M), 1.1480 (685M)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Not quite a case of hero from zero, but UK debt has gradually chipped away at Wednesday’s post-BoE/budget arrears to reclaim 138.00+ status at 138.12 and overtake Bunds in the process, even though BTPs and Eurozone peripheral bonds are looking more apprehensive pre-ECB and after Italian supply. Meanwhile, US Treasuries have regained some composure following a pronounced sell-off late yesterday as thin liquidity and purported RP long liquidation compounded the move, but with the curve re-flattening perhaps counterintuitively in advance of the 30 year auction that may need some form of concession, albeit with long bond yields remaining considerably high than they were at the start of the week (circa 1.24% compared to only a fraction above 70 bp at one stage on Monday).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Further downside in WTI and Brent front-month futures </strong>as the complex continues its OPEC and virus-induced sell-off with the overall narrative around the market largely unchanged, although additional bearish factors include WHO labelling the outbreak as a pandemic and US President Trump announcing a 30-day travel ban to Europe. The contracts are under further pressure from bearish comments from the Russian Deputy Energy Minister who suggested that deeper oil cuts would be ineffective and challenging – alluding to a reaffirmation in stance as Saudi attempts to force Moscow’s hand to agree to further reductions. That said, Energy Ministry Novak stated that the OPEC+ JTC on March 18th will be conducted by video conference – which was signalled earlier but the notion suggests that Russia is willing to cooperate with the other oil producers despite the soured relations with Saudi Arabia. However, the Russian Energy Minister is set to meet with Russian oil companies today to discuss the OPEC situation, with expectations skewed to no-change in their stance regarding cuts. WTI Apr’20 and Brent May’20 hold onto losses of ~5% at the time of writing as the former briefly breached USD 31/bbl to the downside in APAC trade whilst the latter found an overnight base sub-33.50/bbl. Conversely, the risk-off sentiment has kept an underlying bid in spot gold which resides just south of the USD 1650/oz level. As a reminder, desks note that <strong>gold prices</strong> could be less supported amid a stock-market selloff as traders and investors will need to close positions to account for decaying margins. Elsewhere, <strong>copper prices</strong> continue to suffer amid the broad risk-off sentiment with prices firmly back under the USD 2.5/lb mark.</p><p><strong>OPEC+ JTC meeting scheduled for March 18th in Vienna is unlikely to occur, according to sources</strong>.

Eur/Usd has lost grip of 1.1300 and 1.1250 to probe technical support between 1.1239-13 that spans a Fib retracement level.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF</strong> - Relative G10 outperformers or at least displaying a degree of resistance to the Buck’s ongoing revival, as the Yen holds above 104.00, albeit off best levels following yet more talk about imminent or impending BoJ stimulus to supplement Japanese Government measures. Meanwhile, the Loonie is trying to contain losses within a 1.3821-3752 band against the backdrop of renewed pressure on oil and the Franc is firm, though contingent on the SNB’s reaction to what unfolds in Frankfurt via the ECB.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - As noted above, broad and hefty losses for regional currencies due to well documented negative factors, but with the Rouble and Mexican Peso particularly weak due to crude correlations.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Not quite a case of hero from zero, but <strong>UK</strong> <strong>debt</strong> has gradually chipped away at Wednesday’s post-BoE/budget arrears to reclaim 138.00+ status at 138.12 and overtake Bunds in the process, even though <strong>BTPs</strong> and Eurozone peripheral bonds are looking more apprehensive pre-ECB and after Italian supply. Meanwhile, <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have regained some composure following a pronounced sell-off late yesterday as thin liquidity and purported RP long liquidation compounded the move, but with the curve re-flattening perhaps counterintuitively in advance of the 30 year auction that may need some form of concession, albeit with long bond yields remaining considerably high than they were at the start of the week (circa 1.24% compared to only a fraction above 70 bp at one stage on Monday).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Further downside in <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures as the complex continues its OPEC and virus-induced sell-off with the overall narrative around the market largely unchanged, although additional bearish factors include WHO labelling the outbreak as a pandemic and US President Trump announcing a 30-day travel ban to Europe. The contracts are under further pressure from bearish comments from the Russian Deputy Energy Minister who suggested that deeper oil cuts would be ineffective and challenging – alluding to a reaffirmation in stance as Saudi attempts to force Moscow’s hand to agree to further reductions. That said, Energy Ministry Novak stated that the OPEC+ JTC on March 18th will be conducted by video conference – which was signalled earlier but the notion suggests that Russia is willing to cooperate with the other oil producers despite the soured relations with Saudi Arabia. However, the Russian Energy Minister is set to meet with Russian oil companies today to discuss the OPEC situation, with expectations skewed to no-change in their stance regarding cuts. <strong>WTI</strong> Apr’20 and <strong>Brent</strong> May’20 hold onto losses of ~5% at the time of writing as the former briefly breached USD 31/bbl to the downside in APAC trade whilst the latter found an overnight base sub-33.50/bbl. Conversely, the risk-off sentiment has kept an underlying bid in <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> which resides just south of the USD 1650/oz level. As a reminder, desks note that <strong>gold</strong> prices could be less supported amid a stock-market selloff as traders and investors will need to close positions to account for decaying margins. Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> prices continue to suffer amid the broad risk-off sentiment with prices firmly back under the USD 2.5/lb mark.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Although the Dollar is on a somewhat mixed footing against major counterparts and the US Treasury curve has flipped back into bull-steepening mode, the <strong>DXY </strong>has bounced firmly from overnight lows and back above 96.500 to breach Fib resistance at 96.695 by virtue of heftier gains vs high beta, activity, risk and even yield rivals, not to mention even more pronounced appreciation relative to floundering EM currencies. On that note, even the recently resilient <strong>YUAN</strong> is succumbing to the latest bout of safe-haven positioning irrespective of latest reports that nCoV has peaked and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak is returning to normal, as Usd/Cnh crosses the psychological 7.0000 mark again.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie has pulled back further towards 0.6400 and through 1.0300 in Kiwi cross terms amidst renewed risk-off trade, and hardly getting any relief from a substantial fiscal injection overnight, while its Antipodean peer has fallen in sympathy from 0.6300+ to sub-0.6250 territory awaiting the RBNZ for more independent impetus and more immediately NZ manufacturing PMI tonight.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Also on the backfoot, with Eur/Nok soaring beyond 11.0000 to another new ATH circa 11.1675 amidst a deeper retracement in crude prices and calls for the Norges Bank to cut the benchmark depo rate by 50 bp next week. Eur/Sek lagging on less dovish Riksbank vibes and mixed Swedish inflation data, while Sterling is back down near early March lows (Cable around 1.2750 and Eur/Gbp 0.8800+) in wake of yesterday’s emergency BoE ease and UK budget excesses. However, the Euro has unwound more post-Fed rate cut strength vs the Greenback in the run up to the ECB amidst high uncertainty over the likely policy adjustments given elevated anticipation for something big like last September’s multi-faceted salvo (check out the Newsquawk Research Suite for a full preview of the March policy meeting that comes with updated Staff forecasts). Eur/Usd has lost grip of 1.1300 and 1.1250 to probe technical support between 1.1239-13 that spans a Fib retracement level.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Relative G10 outperformers or at least displaying a degree of resistance to the Buck’s ongoing revival, as the Yen holds above 104.00, albeit off best levels following yet more talk about imminent or impending BoJ stimulus to supplement Japanese Government measures. Meanwhile, the Loonie is trying to contain losses within a 1.3821-3752 band against the backdrop of renewed pressure on oil and the Franc is firm, though contingent on the SNB’s reaction to what unfolds in Frankfurt via the ECB.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>As noted above, broad and hefty losses for regional currencies due to well documented negative factors, but with the Rouble and Mexican Peso particularly weak due to crude correlations.</p>",

On that note, expectations are elevated for the ECB to join other global Central Banks in concerted efforts to cushion the economic fallout, but it remains to be seen what new President Lagarde has to offer and whether she emulates her predecessor Draghi with a whatever it takes to save the day package of stimulus measures. In the interim, stock watching resumes, but with core debt and equities not quite as inversely correlated compared to recent sessions.</p>",

President Trump announced to suspend all travel from the EU to the US for 30 days which does not apply to the UK and he unveiled several relief measures including support for small businesses, the deferral of some tax payments and called on Congress for immediate payroll tax relief, although these failed to appease markets and the travel restrictions subsequently dragged <strong>EURO STOXX 50 futures</strong> lower by as much as 8%. <strong>ASX 200 (-7.4%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-3.9%)</strong> slumped with energy and commodity-related stocks front running the broad losses in Australia which saw the index post its worst decline since 2008 despite the government announcement of measures valued at AUD 17.6bln in response to the outbreak, while the Japanese benchmark collapsed on the weight of the JPY inflows and languished firmly below the 19k level where the BoJ flagged it would incur losses on ETF holdings. <strong>Hang Seng (-3.8%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.7%)</strong> conformed to the negative tone amid the global rout and after weaker than expected Chinese lending data, but with losses in the mainland at a lesser extent as China’s coronavirus updates continued to show a moderation in additional cases. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured at the open and briefly fell below 154.00 on initial spill over selling from USTs, although Japanese bond prices then briefly reversed some of the losses as the sell-off in stocks worsened, before selling resumed once again in the aftermath of the 20yr JGB auction which showed weaker results across all metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

The softer greenback provided some reprieve for <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which briefly reclaimed the 1.1300 handle ahead of today’s ECB meeting, although <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> remained subdued near 1.2800 after the prior day’s 50bps emergency rate cut by the BoE, UK budget spending boost and weak data releases. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> retreated below the 104.00 handle on the safe-haven flows which also underpinned CHF, while antipodeans were lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses and after <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> recently gave up the 0.6500 and 0.6300 handles respectively.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were subdued in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures retreated nearly 5% to test the USD 31.00/bbl level, with the energy complex pressured by the negative risk environment. Furthermore, there were also bearish comments from Russia’s Deputy Energy Minister who suggested that deeper oil cuts would challenging and ineffective.

(Fox/Twitter)</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>A choppy session for the TPLEX as duration came to somewhat of a roadblock as equities sold off. Despite the returning risk aversion, after Tuesday’s dead-cat bounce, the belly to long-end of the curve failed to catch a bid. Desks noted the likely profit taking after recent sessions of strong flight-to-quality, particularly RP-type selling the long-end, with bonds failing to perform as an equity hedge as positions become overstretched. Note that participants took advantage of the back up in yields at the 10-year Treasury auction, which stopped through the 0.854% WI by 0.5bps, although did see dealers take a larger than average takedown as well as being covered less than average, but nonetheless did provide a short-lived paring of the steepener, before selling re-emerged into the settlement, where the 10-year yield had risen around 6bps to 0.810%, 2s10s +6.5bps, 2s30s +8.5bps.</p><p>US President Trump said he we will be making lots of small business loans after a meeting with top banking executives and believes there will be pent-up demand when the outbreak is over in the hopefully not too distant future.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with hefty losses again after another bloodbath on Wall St where the DJIA slipped by almost 1500 points and into bear market territory due to ongoing fallout from the coronavirus which the World Health Organization have labelled as a global pandemic, while the sell-off extends overnight with Dow futures now below the 23k level to post further losses of as much as 1200 points after US President Trump’s primetime address where he announced to suspend all travel from the EU to the US for 30 days which saw EURO STOXX 50 futures decline 8%. Furthermore, President Trump stated the travel restrictions do not apply to the UK and announced several relief measures including support for small businesses, the deferral of some tax payments and called on Congress for immediate payroll tax relief, although these failed to appease markets. ASX 200 (-5.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-4.8%) slumped with energy and commodity-related stocks front running the broad losses in Australia with the index at the lowest since 2016 despite the government announcement of measures valued at AUD 17.6bln in response to the outbreak, while the Japanese benchmark collapses on the weight of the JPY inflows and languishes firmly below the 19k level where the BoJ noted it would incur paper losses on ETF holdings. Hang Seng (-3.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) conform to the negative tone amid the global rout and after weaker than expected Chinese lending data, but with losses in the mainland to a lesser extent as China’s coronavirus updates continue to show a moderation in additional cases.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is weaker and has reversed some of the prior day’s gains after President Trump’s address was met with disappointment and subsequently sent yields lower and saw Fed Fund Rate futures price in nearly 95% chance of the Fed cutting rates by a further 100bps this month. The weaker greenback provided some reprieve for EUR/USD which reclaimed the 1.1300 handle ahead of today’s ECB meeting, although GBP/USD remains subdued near 1.2800 after the prior day’s 50bps emergency rate cut by the BoE, UK budget spending boost and weak data releases. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retreated firmly below the 104.00 handle on the safe-haven flows which also underpinned CHF, while antipodeans were lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses and after AUD/USD and NZD/USD recently gave up the 0.6500 and 0.6300 handles respectively. EM currencies were also pressured as the spooked risk appetite continued to spur hot money outflows and with MXN also dragged by weaker oil prices.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured at the open and briefly fell below 154.00 on initial spill over selling from USTs, although Japanese bond prices then reversed some of the losses as the sell-off in stocks worsened, while focus now shifts to the 20yr JGB auction later.&nbsp;</p>",
