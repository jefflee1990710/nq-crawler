Speakers: ECB’s Lane; Fed’s Kaplan (2020 voter), Williams (voter), Rosengren; BOE’s Carney.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>The three major US indices opened at record highs, extending their gains after a Phase One agreement between US &amp; China was reached on Friday, leaving expectations for a signing in January, barring any issues. Desks noted a large equity buy programme, the largest since early October, helping bourses find their “Christmas rally” and seeing speculators offering duration in the Fixed Income complex. All sectors traded in the green, technology lead the outperformers at the open, boosted by Semiconductors (SOX) after the trade-sensitive space saw a positive mention from JPMorgan and a few individual stock upgrades (WDC, MU) from Susquehanna; Energy was the outperformer despite crude’s modest gains. Industrials was an underperformer following reports Boeing (BA) is considering halting or cutting production of its 737 MAX, but again still marginally in the green amid the widespread equity bid, although it did lead the DJIA to considerately underperform both SPX and NDQ. Flash PMI data failed to see any price action, however Markit’s manufacturing print ticked down slightly as expected to 52.5 from 52.6, New orders also declined to 53.2 from 53.6. Services however fared better as it rose to 52.2, beating expectations for a rise to 51.8 from 51.6, and the new business index also ticked up to 52.4 from 51.2. This mornings EZ data continued to show a worry in the manufacturing sector, however the pick-up in services reassured participants that the manufacturing isn’t quite seeping into other sectors.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA PHASE ONE 'DEAL':</strong> Analysts have highlighted that the 'deal' between US and China is very light on details; China has not had to commit to a specific monetary value of us ags purchases, and the 'deal' lacks an enforcement mechanism. In return the US has agreed to roll-back some tariffs on Chinese imports. Some have suggested that this was far less progress than the market was expecting, and while the 'deal' will likely be signed off in January by both countries (we now revert back to monitoring where the meeting will take place, and whom the deal will be signed by; the latest updates suggest it will take place in Washington in January, and will be signed off by USTR Lighthizer and China Vice Premier Liu He), thus preventing any immediate trade war escalation (in theory), a fully-fledged deal remains a long way off -- possibly until after the Presidential Elections in November 2020. However. ING warns that in the interim, market uncertainty on the actual content/implications of the deal may continue to be fuelled by more contradictory newsflow on the matter.</p><p><strong>* US EMPIRE STATE MANUFACTURING (DEC):</strong> The headline rose by less than expected to 3.5 (exp. 4.0, prev 2.9), the headline was underpinned by a solid showing for shipments, but new orders remains weak and employment held steady, Oxford Economics noted; \"weaker domestic and global growth as well as trade policy headwinds are keeping persistent pressure on regional manufacturing activity. However, the forward-looking components were more encouraging; expectations rose by 10.4 points to 29.8, and OxEco sees the potential for a material acceleration in manufacturing activity in 2020.</p><p><strong>* US ADVANCE DEC PMI:</strong> The manufacturing PMI fell one-tenth to 52.5, as expected, while the services PMI topped expectations at 52.2 (exp. 51.8, prev. 51.6), helping to bump the composite to 52.2 from 52.0. Markit said the surveys were a welcome sign the economy was continuing to regain growth momentum; the outlook also brightened, as did business activity, order book and jobs growth, which all ticked up to five-month highs, buoyed by rising domestic sales and further signs of renewed life in export orders. Markit said that business activity expectations lifted higher in both sectors, rising to the highest since June, which suggests that the expansion will continue to gain momentum; the optimism reflected reduced fears over trade wars and more favourable financial conditions. With that said, Markit stated that the brighter news needs to be caveated, as the overall rate of economic expansion signalled by the surveys remains well below that seen this time last year, commensurate with GDP rising at an annualised rate of just over 1.5%. \"Importantly, however, the welcome signs of improvement help to ward off recession risks and should keep the Fed on hold in the coming months,\" and \"the upward trajectory in the surveys support our expectations that the US economy is on course to see another year of above potential GDP growth of approximately 2.2% in 2020.”</p><p><strong>* USMCA</strong>: Over the weekend, the USMCA was facing fresh setbacks, with Mexico's top negotiator Seade dismissing claims that Mexico would be subject to labour enforcement inspections from other nations as part of the deal; Seade tweeted \"Mexico will NEVER accept any measure that would see inspectors disguised for a simple reason: Mexican law prohibits it,\" and in another tweet adding with emphasis \"NO INSPECTORS\" - some of his tweets were later deleted. The labour provisions within the deal were a sticking point for Democrats. On Monday, however, the Mexicans were keen to signal the debate over inspectors did not put USMCA at risk, and that it was up to Mexico to accept diplomatic labour attaché that US Congress proposed. The USTR issued a statement in response which noted that five labour attaches would work with Mexico to implement the reforms which would abide by Mexican law, adding the labour verifications would be conducted by independent panellists, not labour attaches.</p><p><strong>* CHINA/GERMANY TRADE:</strong> China has threatened to retaliate against Germany if Huawei was banned from supplying equipment to Germany's 5G telecoms network, with the Chinese ambassador to Germany highlighting German auto exports to China as a potential target.</p><p><strong>* EZ ADVANCE DEC PMI:</strong> EU Markit Composite Flash PMI for December printed 50.6, unchanged from the prior and marginally below the expected 50.7. Manufacturing fell to 45.9 from 46.9, missing the expected rise to 47.3, whilst Services rose to 52.4 from 51.9, above the expected 52. Survey compiler Markit said the EZ economy has been stuck in crawler gear for fourth straight months, with the PMI indicative of GDP growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.1%. Other analysts noted that the weakness isolated to manufacturing, not services, could indicate domestic demand is remaining resilient, after concerns last month; and the composite index remained unchanged, an encouraging sign.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY ADVANCE DEC PMI:</strong> Manufacturing Flash fell to 43.4 (Exp. 44.5, Prev. 44.1), services rose in line with expectations to 52.0 from 51.7, and the composite was unchanged at 49.4 against an expected rise to 49.9. Pantheon Macroeconomics' analysts said that the only bright spot in these data was that the rate of contraction in manufacturing new orders is now easing, though the overall downtrend is still more than enough to offset a higher new business intake in services; new orders are falling in the private sector as a whole. \"This discrepancy carries over to the other details too,\" PM writes, \"work backlogs and employment are still sliding overall, thanks to weakness in manufacturing, a trend that is feeding through to prices,\" and adds that \"both input and output price inflation have collapsed, especially in the industrial sector, and finally, the outlook for production and new orders over the next 12 months improved, though mainly in services.\"</p><p><strong>* CHINESE INDUSTRIAL: </strong>For November Y/Y printed 6.2%, beating the expected 5.0% and up from the prior 4.7%. SocGen’s analysts highlight both the growth in manufacturing and mining output improving, whilst utilities remained steady, “The warmer-than-usual weather looked to be a supporting factor, as did the more lenient production controls for the winter. Altogether, looking through the monthly volatility, last month’s improvement took the average for October and November to 5.1%, up from 5.0% in 3Q, i.e. still an indication of activity stabilisation.”</p><p><strong>* ECB: Weidmann</strong> (hawk) appeared to dial down his hawkishness in an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung, stating that the government's commitment to a balanced budget should not become a \"fetish\", and also appeared to temper his opposition to proposals for including climate change as part of the ECB's mandate, though he added that central banks cannot make climate policy themselves. ECB <strong>VP de Guindos</strong> said the lower for longer interest rate environment creates strains on profitability of banks, with implications for financial stability, and added that the latest indicators point to a stabilization of economic activity. Meanwhile <strong>Holzmann</strong> (hawk) said he sees a possible ECB rate change in the event the inflation trough passes during 2020.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLED 19+ TICKS LOWER AT 128-13+. </strong>The TPLEX exhibited pronounced bear steepening, lead by the belly, on Monday as investors got long on risk assets as the dust settled from the US-China Phase One announcements. Desks noted the move was exacerbated by a multi-month, record size, equity buy programme, leading to speculative selling in the belly to long end; a chunky block steepener was recorded, with 26.7k TUH contracts bid and 5.3k USH contracts offered. By settlement the 10-year yield was just shy of 1.9%, up over 6bps on the session, whilst the 2-year yield rose just 4% to 1.64%, seeing the 2s10s widen over 2.5bps; the 2s30s widened a less pronounced ~1.7bps.</p><p><strong>* FED REPO OPERATIONS:</strong> The NY Fed’s 32-day repo operation was slightly oversubscribed, with USD 54.25bln bids submitted versus USD 50bln offered. Meanwhile, the overnight operation was well under-subscribed, with all USD 36.40bln in bids accepted. Monday had been marked as a potential pressure point within the repo and funding markets, since it falls on both a Treasury auction settlement date and corporate quarterly tax payment date, in an echo to the prior “blow-up” in September; however the GC opened up at 1.7% (within the FFR target) which helped to alleviate some concerns of such an event on Monday, but risks remain heading into the critical year-end period, analyst said, while BMO reminds us that over 40% allocation to MBS collateral serves as a reminder that funding needs extending well beyond the Treasury market, even on days with a USD 54bln net coupon settlement.</p><p><strong>* PBOC MLF:</strong> The 1-year MLF rate was kept unchanged at 3.25%, and the PBOC added a small injection on Monday. The Ministry of Finance also said it would issue CNY 10bln 6-month offshore bills on 20th December.</p><p><strong>* AUSSIE MYEFO:</strong> The Treasury's 2019/20 growth forecast was unchanged at 2.25% in its mid-year economic and financial outlook, while wage growth forecast was lowered to 2.50% from 2.75%; 2019/20 budget surplus view was narrowed to AUD 5bln (around 0.3% of GDP) from 7.1bln, while the 2021 surplus estimate remained at AUD 6.1bln (prev. forecast was AUD 11.0bln), and over a four-year horizon, the budget was narrowed by AUD 22bln, which was more than expected. Elsewhere, the issuance profile was also lowered in the next financial year, though does rise over the rest of the forecast horizon. UBS said it expects further tax cuts in May, but there is downside risk to its forecast of AUD 10bln in household tax cuts, and that reduced capacity for fiscal stimulus likely supports its expectation of further RBA easing ahead; the Bank sees the RBA cutting its cash rate further next year, pencilling in a 25bps reduction in February, and another 25bps cut in to 0.25% by mid-2020.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 0.14 HIGHER AT USD 60.21/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLED 0.12 HIGHER AT USD 65.34/BBL.</strong> Crude benchmarks edged higher to start the week as participants digested the Phase One US-China trade deal announcements and some positive Chinese activity data in the Asia session. There was little in the way of energy-specific market updates, with sentiment being carried from the China deal, in addition to the recent OPEC+ production cut deal in the background. Note that WTI (F0) options expire on Monday, book squaring could have been an element of the session’s tape action. Looking ahead to this week’s inventories expectations (bbls): Crude stocks -1.9mln, Gasoline +2.1mln and Distillate +0.2mln.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> SPX +0.7% at 3191, NDX +1.0% at 8570, DJIA +0.4% at 28236</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Semiconductors (SOX) performed well today after the sector gained a positive mention at JP Morgan, who forecast further upside in 2020 as industry growth rates inflect positively and drive a positive earnings revision cycle; The same analyst, Harlan Sur, noted the top pick in the space is Broadcom (AVGO), citing its underappreciated diversification and strong FCF and dividend growth, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Micron (MU) on strong data centre exposure, Qorvo (QRVO), Marvell (MRVL) as key 5G plays and Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip (MCHP) on improving industrial/cyclical trends. Elsewhere, Micron (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) also benefitting from upgrades at Susquehanna. Boeing (BA) weighed DJIA after reports stated the jet manufacturer is considering halting or cutting production of its 737 MAX jet as there are further concerns regarding the return of the jet.&nbsp; Apple (AAPL) traded firmer after a positive mention at Cleveland Research, who are optimistic on the stock citing strong iPhone revenues and its quickly accelerating wearables business. International Flavours and Fragrances (IFF) traded lower after DuPont (DD) it is to merge its Nutrition &amp; Bioscience unit with IFF. DD holders will hold 55.4% of the combined company and will receive a onetime USD 7.3bln special cash payment when the deal is closed. DuPont (DD) initially opened higher however the majority of gains pared throughout the session. Uber (UBER) traded higher after it is reportedly in talks to sell its UberEats India business to a local rival. Tesla (TSLA) also performed well following a positive note from Credit Suisse, with the analyst a noted bear, saying, “Tesla is leading in the areas that will likely define the future of car making-software and electrification”. However, the EV maker saw some selling pressure after a senator stated an electric car tax credit is unlikely in a spending deal. Goldman Sachs (GS) also traded firmer after an upgrade at Citi. Elsewhere, Amarin (AMRN) traded higher after its Vascepa, a drug used to reduce cardiovascular risk, received FDA approval; whereas BeiGene (BGNE) fell roughly 8% after its phase 3 ASPEN trial failed to meet its primary endpoint.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: CNH </strong>pared some of Fridays losses and USDCNH trades back beneath the 7.00 handle amid a firmer midpoint fix by the PBoC last night and constructive comments from the Global Times noting the exchange rate will remain stable due to promising domestic growth. Strong industrial output data last night likely also helping the Yuan. <strong>DXY</strong> traded in the red today as it moved below the 97.00 handle, although resides just above it going into ASIAPAC trade after the index saw a turnaround from lows of 96.93 following strong NAHB data. Markit PMI data did little to move the buck as it fell largely in line with expectations, although the Markit services PMI was firmer than expected. <strong>EUR </strong>traded firmer today despite mixed EZ PMI’s, which saw a poor manufacturing print, but services were slightly firmer than expected. The single currency broke 1.1150 to the upside continuing its run from last week and paring back Friday’s downside. <strong>GBP </strong>traded firmer against the buck, and weaker against the EUR after a set of poor PMI’s and a stalling of the post GE rally. However, Cable still trades around the 1.33-1.34 mark after paring some of initial post-election gains which saw the cross trade as high as 1.35 in the election aftermath. <strong>Havens</strong> were mixed against the buck with JPY weaker today amid no further catalyst however rate differentials are likely playing a factor amid rising US yields. XAU traded flat as it traded in a very tight 6 buck range around the 1475 level. <strong>EMFX</strong> were generally firmer against the buck with outperformance seen in BRL &amp; ZAR, with the latter likely benefitting as no further load shedding was reported. TRY, the underperformer, after renewed angst on the Turkish-US relations front and USDTRY edging closer to technical resistance beyond 5.8500.</p>",

The Greenback and currency market in general are still weighing up the details of US-China trade accord part one divulged so far, or perhaps more importantly the significance of what has not been said like exactly how much agricultural products Beijing has pledged to buy and whether Washington is willing to withdraw more tariffs.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>All on the front foot vs the Usd, with the Euro ending a relatively sombre start to the last full week of the year among the top major performers alongside the non-US Dollars even though preliminary Eurozone PMIs were less impressive overall, and in the case of Germany’s manufacturing sector just plain bad. However, Eur/Usd managed to breach 1.1150 at best, while Aud/Usd edged a bit closer to 0.6900, Nzd/Usd held around 0.6600 and Usd/Cad was capped below 1.3150 for the most part.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A weak set of UK PMIs and some stalling of GE momentum kept the Pound in check after early rallies in Cable to around 1.3422 and within a few pips of 0.8300 vs the single currency. Sterling also awaits Friday’s Parliament vote on PM Johnson’s Brexit withdrawal deal with baited breath, but in the interim some hard data and more immediately the BoE’s FSR. Meanwhile, the Franc continues to meander between 0.9845-20 parameters and hold up better than the Yen (like Gold) that is more correlated with US Treasury yields and now under 109.50 eyeing recent lows as 109.71 and 109.73.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona has lost momentum having failed to extend gains through 10.0100 against the Euro, but its Swedish peer still looks capable of rebounding further within a 10.4465-4140 range given a widely anticipated ¼ point Riksbank tightening move this Thursday.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Yuans have reclaimed 7.0000+ status with the aid of a stronger PBoC midpoint fix and constructive sounding comments in China’s Global times claiming that the exchange rate will remain stable due to promising domestic growth (after IP and Retail Sales beats) and expectations that the external environment turns more stable. On that note, wires report that the USTR and China’s VP will sign off on Phase 1 in early January. Conversely, the Lira suffered renewed angst on the Turkish-US relations front and Usd/Try is edging closer to technical resistance beyond 5.8500.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling’s post-UK election 2nd coming was already fading after a fleeting foray above 1.3400 vs the Dollar and test of resistance around the psychological 0.8300 level against the single currency when the preliminary PMIs for December confounded expectations for some improvement and missed consensus by quite a distance, especially in the manufacturing sector. Cable duly retreated towards 1.3325 and the cross rebounded to circa 0.8350 even though the earlier Eurozone flash surveys were also disappointing, and Germany’s manufacturing headline in particular. However, Eur/Usd remains depressed within a 1.1123-50 range and may struggle to pull away from decent option expiries between 1.1120-25 and 1.1100-10 (1.2 bn clips) rather than challenging slightly larger interest at 1.1150 (1.3 bn).</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>All firmer vs their US counterpart that continues to flounder (<strong>DXY </strong>anchored around 97.000), with the Kiwi keeping tabs on the 0.6600 handle, Aussie hovering just under 0.6900 and Loonie pivoting 1.3150 in wake of some upbeat Chinese data overnight (ip and retail sales) and further reserved reflection on US-China trade deal Phase 1. Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd have both regrouped after losing some ground on independent impulses via growth forecast downgrades from the NZIER and government respectively, while the former also took note of Westpac rolling its RBNZ rate cut prediction to August next year from February.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are both holding firm lines ahead of this week’s Norges Bank and Riksbank policy meetings, but Eur/Nok’s retreat is more technical after breaching the 100 DMA (10.0385) compared to Eur/Sek’s reversal through 10.4300 in anticipation of a 25 bp repo rate hike on Thursday.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>The safe-haven Franc and Yen are narrowly mixed against the Buck, with Usd/Chf nearer the bottom of a 0.9825-45 band in contrast to Usd/Jpy hovering just below 109.50 compared to 109.25 at one stage and flanked by expiries between 109.00-05 and 109.50 in 1bn.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Against the grain of broad rallies vs the Dollar, Usd/Try is nudging 5.8500 and an upside chart objective at 5.8671 amidst heightened Turkish-US angst after President Erdogan’s threat to shut NATO bases if Washington decides to impose more sanctions.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed following relatively light newsflow over the weekend and last Friday’s flat performance on Wall St. where the major indices consolidated near record levels after the confirmation of a US-China phase one deal which officials plan to sign in early January, although some noted the deal was only limited and questions arose over the feasibility of China committing to as much as USD 50bln of US agriculture goods. ASX 200 (+1.6%) outperforms with defensives and the top-weighted financials outperforming after the world’s 2 largest economies averted the December 15th tariffs, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) is subdued by the recent pullback in USD/JPY and as the latest domestic manufacturing PMI data remained in contraction territory. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are constrained despite the phase one agreement confirmation and better than expected Chinese data in which Industrial Production and Retail Sales both topped estimates, as the stats bureau stated the economy still faces relatively big downward pressure and amid expectations for a reduced growth target for next year, while the mood in Hong Kong is also soured by the resumption of violent protests over the weekend.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre and trickles back towards the 97.00 level after EUR/USD mildly rebounded from support at 1.1110 and GBP/USD benefitted from a mild post-election second wind with UK PM Johnson reportedly looking for a parliament vote on Brexit before Christmas to get it done by January 31st deadline. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses languish after their recent pullback, while antipodeans are also subdued after failing to profusely capitalize on the firmer CNY reference rate and encouraging China data. In addition, the latest Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook for Australia showed the government cut the current fiscal year growth forecast to 2.25% from 2.75% and reduced its wage growth estimate by 25bps to 2.50%.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with prices restricted by last week’s resistance levels and with demand also subdued by the lack of BoJ presence in the market today.</p>",
