The jobless rate forecast was lowered to 5.1% from 5.25%, and the Central Bank still sees it sub-5.00% in 2021. Meanwhile, Westpac also finds it interesting that the statement does not repeat the description \"gentle turning point\" although the arguments pointing to an improving growth outlook. Interestingly, the previous line that the Board \"continues to monitor developments, including in the labour market\" has been tweaked to \"the Board will continue to monitor developments carefully, including in the labour market\", which Westpac says may suggest that the Board being more uncertain about future developments, and therefore wanting to emphasise its strong duty of care<strong>. On a more macro front, the RBA noted that bushfires and coronavirus will temporarily weigh on growth although it is too early to determine how long-lasting impact from coronavirus will be, participants expected a bleaker assessment of the impacts on the domestic economy. </strong>In the minutes, participants will likely be more focused on sophisticated assessment of the potential impacts from the Australian bushfires and the virus outbreak discussed at the meeting, alongside more meat on the bone regarding the less dovish-than-anticipated domestic growth forecasts.</p>",

        "subject": "(Early) Market Wrap: China adds liquidity, supporting sentiment; Key UK Brexit speech eyed at 18:45 GMT",
        "content": "<p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>The PBOC's liquidity offerings have supported market sentiment amid Coronavirus fallout. US players have been away for President's Day, and will return on Tuesday. Ranges were generally tight, although the GBP is under pressure ahead of an address by Brexit &nbsp;Advisor Frost (due at 1845) who is expected to outline the UK's goals in trade negotiations. ZAR is also under pressure ahead of the budget on 26th February after Moody's downgraded its growth view.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>China's coronavirus death toll reaches 1765, according to the Chinese government, AFP reported (on Friday, China’s total coronavirus cases was at 66492 and death toll at 1523). Meanwhile, Hubei province reported 1933 new coronavirus cases and 100 additional deaths as of February 16th, with total of 58182 cases and 1696 deaths in the province, according to the local health commissioner (this is compared to 2420 new coronavirus cases and 139 additional deaths as of February 14th). The head of Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital reportedly said that the turning point of the epidemic has been reached, and the number of new outbreaks is declining. China Global Times reports the number of patients infected with Coronavirus will likely peak during the second half of February in southern China; nationwide, the peak is seen in in April, according to the central government’s top medical advisor. WHO Chief Tedros reiterated that the data from China appears to show a decline in new cases, but notes it must be interpreted very cautiously as trends can change as new populations are effected. Tedros also said was too early to tell if this trend of fewer new coronavirus cases in China will continue, adding \"every scenario is still on the table\". Meanwhile, the US CDC has listed 467 people in 42 states in the US under investigation for the novel coronavirus; of them, 15 have tested positive, 392 negative, and 60 are still pending, CNN reported.</p><p><strong>* PBOC: </strong>China's central bank lowered the rate on its medium-term funding operations by 10bps, taking it to 3.15%, and injected 100bln CNY of funds via 7-day repo operations. Analysts are expecting the PBOC to further lower its LPR rate on Thursday. Separately, over the weekend, finance minister Liu Kun stated that the government would be rolling out further tax cuts to help businesses. Meanwhile, Moody’s downgraded its 2020 GDP growth forecast for China to 5.2% on Monday.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Overnight, it was reported that China was said to be mulling making some US agricultural purchases by late February early March to show its Phase One trade deal commitment to the US, although no final decision has been made, according to sources. Chinese Diplomat Wang Yi said China is focused on implementing Phase One trade deal with the US; as Phase One is implemented, China will consider starting Phase Two. US President Trump's administration is weighing new trade restrictions on China that would limit the use of American chip-making equipment, as it seeks to cut off Chinese access to key semiconductor technology, according to people familiar with the matter, cited by the WSJ. Additionally, the US government is considering whether to stop General Electric (GE) from continuing to supply engines for a new Chinese passenger jet, sources quoted by Reuters reported.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>Crude prices have a slight upside bias, though trading conditions are thin as US participants are away for President's Day. There is still no indication from Russia on whether it plans to back proposals to deepen output supply curbs; the Russian Energy Minister Novak held a discussion with his Iranian counterpart, according to the Russian Energy Ministry, though no other key details were provided.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>New lows for the EUR after the Bundesbank warned that German exporters were likely to suffer due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. The single-currency bounced off lows last seen in April 2017, around 1.0821. The EUR has been sold recently due to fears the recent outbreak of coronavirus will provide another negative for the German economy, since China is a key export market. Additionally, traders have been selling EUR for carry. A few desks have suggested that rallies are to be sold into.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>A grim GDP report, and easing demand for havens saw USDJPY come within a whisker of 110.00. Japan's economy contracted by 6.3% in Q4, the largest fall in five years, with the recently implemented sales tax hike weighed on consumer and business spending. Capital Economics said the sharp drop in output after October's sales tax hike supports the argument that Japan's economy will shrink this year, however, with capacity shortages still tight and underlying inflation holding up, CapEco still expects the BOJ to keep monetary policy settings unchanged.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The Prime Minister's Brexit advisor Frost will deliver a key address at 1845 UK time, where he will outline the UK's trade goals. Over the weekend, the French Foreign Minister said negotiations would see the UK and EU try and \"rip each other apart\", adding that it would be difficult for the UK to strike a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year. On the fundamental front, there is quite a bit on the data docket; on Tuesday, UK labour market data will be released ahead of inflation data on Wednesday, and retail sales on Thursday; Friday brings the prelim PMI data for Feb.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has slipped to the bottom of the major ranks ahead of a speech from Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator Frost at 18.45GMT that pundits are suggesting he will use as a platform to blame Brussels for undermining prospects of reaching a deal due to the EU’s insistence that the UK sticks to bloc rules. Instead, he will call for agreements akin to those in existence with Canada, Japan and South Korea, and for the EU’s part the FT reports that there is no sign of backing off from level playing field requirements. Cable has slipped further towards 1.3000 from just over 1.3050 at best, while Eur/Gbp remains elevated within a circa 0.8300-35 range and just above option expiry interest in 675 mn between the big figure and 0.8310.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All marginally firmer against the Greenback, as the Loonie just eclipses the Aussie for best G10 currency and remains closer to the upper end of a 1.3255-25 band eyeing virtually concurrent MA levels in the form of the 200 and 21 day markers (1.3018 and 1.3017 respectively). Note, Canadian securities data largely shrugged aside. However, Aud/Usd is still ruling the roost down under, albeit off best levels and drifting closer to 0.6700 after failing to clear resistance around 0.6730, with the Aud/Nzd cross hovering around 1.0450. Similarly, the Euro is nearer to the base of 1.0822-50 parameters after a rather cautious Buba monthly report flagging meek Q1 growth and export contagion from China’s nCoV, which could prompt some fiscal pledges from the Eurogroup at the end of today’s meeting.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Although the Dollar remains mixed vs most counterparts, the <strong>DXY </strong>has notched a new intraday high at 99.184 from 99.041 at the low, though still shy of the 99.241 post-weekend peak that almost matched the 8 October 2019 high (99.249) protecting last year’s pinnacle (99.667). The index has ticked back up by virtue of the more pronounced Pound losses and gains pared elsewhere as noted above, but volumes remain below par due to the US Presidents’ Day holiday.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The other marginal laggards and modestly weaker against the Buck, as Usd/Chf trades above 0.9800, Nzd/Usd meanders at the lower end of 0.6450-21 extremes and Usd/Jpy straddles 109.80 after confirmation that the Japanese economy contracted more than anticipated in Q1.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Zar retracement from last week’s highs has intensified after Moody’s downgraded SA GDP forecasts to compound jitters ahead of CPI data and the key Budget next week, with the Rand now closer to 15.0000 again vs 14.8530 or so at one stage and around 14.7333 on February 12. Conversely, the Rub continues to derive underlying support from tax payment demand and the Cnh/Cny via the ongoing plateauing in China’s coronavirus contamination count and death toll as the number of people cured and leaving hospital rises. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European bourses (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) have kicked the week off on a relatively tentative footing following a mixed Asia-Pac session and ahead of market closures Stateside for the Presidents’ Day holiday (full details available via the Newsquawk calendar). Newsflow from a broader macro perspective has been relatively limited during EU hours thus far, as participants eye UK Brexit negotiator Frost’s speech at 1845GMT (expected to provide greater clarity on the UK’s negotiating position) and the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels, with some in the market looking for signs of an agreement leaning in favour of more growth-friendly policies. Sectoral performance in Europe is mixed thus far with some modest outperformance in energy names, in-fitting with last week’s late pick-up in crude prices, whilst Consumer Discretionary names are also seen higher. In terms of stock specifics, Faurecia (+5.4%) sits near the top of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings, subsequently, providing some support to auto-peers including Valeo (+5.5%) and Continental (+3.8%). Elsewhere, Alstom (+2.9%) shares have been supported after coming to a preliminary agreement with Bombardier to purchase their train business for over USD 7bln, whilst HSBC (+1.1%) slightly outperforms the FTSE 100 (+0.3%) benchmark after reports of a huge overhaul to its operations alongside its earnings report tomorrow. To the downside, Tullow Oil (-4.0%) lags its peers after abandoning an offshore well in Peru, whilst troubled NMC Health (U/C) have endured further losses after a boardroom shake up triggered the departure of its founder and chairman.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>Typically tight ranges and rather aimless trade due to the long US weekend to mark Presidents’ Day, but the Greenback is mildly softer vs most major counterparts and mixed in relation to EM currencies. Indeed, the DXY has eased back from best levels within a 99.153-041 band after fading just a fraction shy of the next upside technical objective (99.249) standing between 99.500 and the 2019 peak set at the start of Q1 (99.667) though still ‘comfortably’ above the nearest chart support through 99.000 (98.885 Fib retracement level).</p><p><strong>AUD - </strong>The marginal G10 outperformer, as Aud/Usd hovers near the top of a 0.6733-13 range and gleans some support from a firmer YUAN on encouraging news from China on the virus front via a slowdown in the number of people infected and fewer fatalities vs a rise in patients cured and discharged. Usd/Cnh has pulled back from 7.0000 again in response and is testing bids around 6.8000 after the PBoC set the Usd/Cny midpoint fix at 6.9795 and injected Cny 200bn 1 year funds at a cheaper 3.15% from 3.25% at the last MLF.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/NZD/CHF - </strong>All benefiting from the waning Buck, as the Loonie probes the base of a 1.3255-25 corridor ahead of 2nd tier Canadian securities data and not far from almost aligning 200 and 21 DMAs (1.3218 and 1.3217 respectively). Meanwhile, the Euro has pared losses between 1.0822-50 parameters in the run up to speeches from ECB chief economist Lane and the Eurogroup meeting, with the Kiwi meandering from 0.6450 to 0.6427 after NZ PM Arden pitched growth this year in the region of 2-2.5% based on temporary contagion from the Chinese health outbreak. Elsewhere, the Franc is narrowly mixed vs the Dollar and Euro just under 0.9800 and over 1.0650 respectively as weekly Swiss sight deposits reveal increases in total and domestic bank balances.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP </strong>- The Yen is just keeping its head afloat of 110.00 amidst modest risk appetite and following much worse than expected Japanese Q1 GDP overnight that was flagged by the BoJ last week, while the Pound is on the backfoot across the board awaiting a keynote Brexit address from chief negotiator Frost at 18.45GMT that is seen highlighting strains between the UK and EU on post-transition rules an regulations. Cable has retreated through 1.3050 and Eur/Gbp is holding above 0.8300, with some 675 mn option expiries rolling off between the round number and 0.8310.</p><p><strong>SCANDI - </strong>The Norwegian Crown is underperforming its Swedish peer in wake of a narrower trade surplus and Eur/Nok bouncing ahead of the psychological 10.0000 mark, while the Commission predicts that last year’s wage deals will add around 1.1% to manufacturing salaries in 2020 and 0.8-1.4% in other sectors. It also forecasts headline CPI around 1.5% and core circa 2%.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Some divergence among regional currencies, as the Rouble benefits from export demand for tax payments, but Rand trades defensively after last week’s solid gains into SA inflation data later this week and the all important budget on February 26.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Turnover is still relatively lacklustre, but <strong>core bonds</strong> seem to have benefited from a similar lethargic tone in equities and reluctance to push the bullish boundaries too far without back up from Wall Street, while also taking a leaf from the more pronounced Eurozone periphery pick-up. Indeed, the rebound in <strong>Bunds</strong> had just enough momentum to push the core 10 year future just above parity at 174.52, while <strong>Gilts </strong>cut their arrears to 10 ticks from -41 ticks at the very early Liffe low and <strong>USTs</strong> are straddling the unchanged line, with the curve incrementally flatter.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>are unchanged at present in a relatively directionless/rangebound session thus far, with tests of the USD 52.00/bbl and USD 57.00/bbl marks to the downside representing the current session lows. For reference, such price action was short-lived and is still someway off recent lows. Crude specific newsflow has been light, as we continue to await a response from Russian Energy Minister Novak on the JTC recommendations; with his only pertinent comments this morning thus far being that he discussed OPEC+ cooperation with the Iranian oil minister. Overnight reports citing delegates noted that OPEC+ is considering cancelling plans for a earlier meeting and are to keep the March 5-6th dates instead; on this, ING posit that if the oil markets continues to consolidate around current price levels than OPEC+ may see little reason to rush into making a decision. Turning to metals where <strong>spot gold</strong> is marginally softer at present, in what has also been a largely rangebound session. Focus for the safe haven will also be on the Middle-East following weekend remarks via a Iranian-backed Shia military leader that a countdown has begun with reference to attacks in Iraq on US forces. <strong>Base metals</strong> are stronger this morning garnering strength from the PBoC’s overnight support measures.</p>",

The bid gained traction from early European trade, with the 10-year yield finding its lows at 1.573%, remaining nearby till settlement. After a few sessions of T-Note selling, the bid is likely partly due to some position squaring, mediocre data, as well as traders looking to cut their risk exposure over the weekend, where the known unknown is whether the nCoV will escalate further, pressing more fears of pandemic rather than the current epidemic. Additionally, following the duration-heavy supply from the Treasury in the past few sessions, the selling pressure (exacerbated by dealer hedging) will have subsided. By settlement, the whole curve was flatter, seeing the 2s10s narrow by 1.5bps, leaving the 10-year yield at 1.59%.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac stocks traded mixed following Wall Street’s flat close on Friday whereby major bourses recovered following reports that the White House is considering tax incentives for people in the US to purchase stocks. ASX 200 (-0.1%) pulled back from near-record highs with the index’s heaviest weighted financial sector leading the losses. Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) underperformed the region but climbed off lows after opening with steep losses following a deeper-than-expected contraction in Japanese Q4 GDP, on a QQ and an annualised basis, with the breakdown also showing that manufacturing contracted by 5.9% on a quarterly basis. As such, a slew of the index’s manufacturing names plumbed the depths, whilst Nissan shares added pressure after its alliance partner Renault slashed their dividend on Friday. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) remained resilient with the former following suit from the latter extending on opening gains amid further support from Chinese authorities to counter coronavirus effects, including touted MLF operations, reductions to corporate taxed and cuts to unnecessary government expenses.</p>",

Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) underperforms the region but trades off lows after opening with steep losses following a deeper-than-expected contraction in Q4 GDP, on a QQ and an annualised basis, with the breakdown also showing that manufacturing contracted by 5.9% on a quarterly basis. As such, a slew of the index’s manufacturing names plumbed the depths, whilst Nissan shares added pressure after its alliance partner Renault slashed their dividend on Friday. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) remain resilient with the former following suit from the latter extending on opening gains amid further support from Chinese authorities to counter coronavirus effects, including touted MLF operations, reductions to corporate taxed and cuts to unnecessary government expenses.</p><p>In FX, DXY trims some of Friday’s gains but retain a 99.00+ status ahead of the US President’s Day Holiday. EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain relatively flat with the former below 1.0850 and the latter trading on either side of 1.3050, after the latter found some support around its 200 WMA at 1.3033, whilst others highlight EUR/GBP options at strikes 0.8300-10 potentially acting as a magnet in the cross. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses trade within a tight intraday band amid the cautious risk sentiment in the market, with former having found mild support at its 10 DMA ~109.70 – with further support seen around 109.50 which coincides with the 21 DMA and the Feb 7th low. JPY was little swayed by Japan reporting a deeper than forecast GDP contraction which showed the largest QQ decline since Q2 2014, although the uptick in GDP deflator – used as an inflation indicator – could provide the BoJ with some solace. Elsewhere, Antipodeans remain choppy and move largely in tandem to the risk sentiment, with AUD/USD receding after touching mild resistance at 0.6730, whilst levels to the downside include Thursday’s 0.6707 low and last week’s base at 0.6657.</p>",
