Treasuries were little changed on the day but traded choppy amid mixed data from both sides of the pond. Gold and crude oil both rallied in the later session.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>President Trump said that trade talks were going well with China, reiterating that there will be a great deal or none at all. On the agricultural purchases issue, Trump said China had made no sign of making the purchases and expressed concern that China would alter the deal in its favour, adding that the deal would be much harder for China in 2020 post the election (which he said he would win). China Global Times Editor tweeted that whenever it's time to negotiate, the US side comes up with the trick of piling pressure, adding that Americans need to change their negotiating style, show more sincerity and not just wield stick. Elsewhere, Japan and the US have reached a broad agreement on the digital economy where digital products are tariff-free and businesses can host servers wherever they choose, Nikkei reported. On the Huawei license issue, US Commerce Secretary Ross said the agency has not yet received all applications from companies interested in licenses to sell to the Chinese telecoms giant and that he expects answers to be forthcoming by next week.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iranian President Rouhani said to French President Macron that normalising oil and banking relations is the first step of expected commitments from Europe to restore the 2015 nuclear deal, adding in their phone call that Iran remains the main safeguard for maritime security and freedom in the region. Macron assured Rouhani that constructive and active cooperation is needed to reduce tensions in the Gulf, and that Paris will continue efforts to secure interests in the nuclear deal. Iran has recently been increasing its nuclear activities following the breakdown of the deal, something that is concerning US officials.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The Sun<strong> </strong>reported that the assumption in Brussels and UK is that UK PM Johnson is planning an election to secure a mandate for renegotiation, however, whether this is before or after October 31st is unclear. Later, UK PM Johnson and Irish PM Varadkar reportedly spoke on the phone, a conversation which sources described as ‘warm’. Reportedly Varadkar told UK PM Johnson that alternative arrangements could replace the backstop in the future, but so far there have not been any satisfactory options to the UK side. UK PM Johnson later reiterated that he is not aiming for a no deal Brexit and does not think that it is where the UK will end up, but if the EU does not compromise, we will have to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* BOJ REVIEW:</strong> The BoJ kept all monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0% with the decision made by vote of 7-2 in which Kataoka and Harada dissented again. It also maintained its forward guidance on keeping rates at extremely low rates at least through to Spring 2020 and added that it will ease without hesitation if momentum to reaching the price goal is lost, while it reduced FY19/20 Real GDP forecast to 0.7% from 0.8% and cut FY19/20 Core CPI forecast to 1.0% from 1.1%.</p><p><strong>* US CORE PCE DATA:</strong> The Fed’s key measure of inflation, Core PCE Price Index, printed at 1.6% falling slightly short of consensus (1.7%), however the pace picked up slightly from the prior revised recordings of 1.5%. The MoM figures fell inline with expectations and printed the same as the prior, 0.2%. The noncore m/m metric printed 0.1%, the same pace as last month which was revised 10bp lower to 0.1%. The y/y figure also in line with the prior 1.4% which was revised lower from 1.5%.&nbsp; Overall a mixed report, but Scotiabank believe that this shows the core inflation has carved out a bottom and stopped falling after it reached its peak of 2.1% last July and lows of 1.5% in March, however they note that there has not been much progress towards lifting transitory factors.</p><p><strong>* US PERSONAL INCOME: </strong>Personal Income increased 0.4%, in line with consensus view however the prior was revised lower from 0.5% to 0.4%. Nonetheless it is the 4th consecutive month of gains for personal income which was driven by a 0.5% increase in wages and salaries; Wells Fargo note. Desks also highlight the tick up in the savings rate to 8.1% from 8%, where it has been on an upward trend since the November 2016 election, which suggests consumers are saving more of their money which may be due to potential precautionary moves or to benefit from the higher rates. Capital Economics also note it seems more likely consumers saved income from the 2018 tax cuts, rather than spent it. Personal consumption was in-line with expectations at 0.3% but the previous was revised higher from 0.4% to 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Consumer confidence came in at 135.7 (8 month high), above the consensus 125 figure and above the top end forecasts of 132. The prior was revised higher from 121.5 to 124.3, showing consumers are more optimistic about business and labour market conditions. Oxford Economics note that this positive reading will support consumer spending in H219 and that despite global headwinds, the core of the US economy remains strong.</p><p><strong>* US CASE SHILLER: </strong>Case Shiller house price index rose 0.1% in May less than expectations of 0.2%, nonetheless still higher from the prior months flat reading. The y/y data was in line with the 2.4% expectations, and slightly lower than the prior 2.5%. BMO note that with the housing sector a vital pillar of support for inflationary pressures and that they continue to watch it carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>Pending home sales index rose to 108.3 from 105.4, showing a 2.8% gain beating the expectations for a 0.5% gain. Wells Fargo note that this data release tends to lead existing home sales by one or two months, therefore this improvement may bode well for the US existing home sales data in July and/or August.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 127-11:</strong> Treasuries were little changed on the day amid choppy trade on thin volumes. Fixed income was bid higher on disappointing Eurozone data, such as weaker than expected June consumer spending and French Q2 GDP. Some downbeat on China tweets from US President Trump helped the move higher going into the US session, but the T-plex reversed course, where analysts noted CTA and algo selling on a strong July Consumer Sentiment reading (135.7, exp. 125.0). At settlement yields were little changed.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 1.18 HIGHER AT USD 58.05/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 1.01 HIGHER AT USD 64.72/BBL: </strong>Crude prices pressed higher on Tuesday, with the lion’s share of the gains coming in a late session break higher absent of immediate fundamental news. Before the breakout, analysts at Citi highlighted that prices had remained near the top end of recent trading edges, which it foreshadowed as a potential upside catalyst. The complex had been supported in the European session, where PVM cited positioning factors ahead of the Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, which is likely to see a rate cut and consequentially weaken the dollar (in theory), which would be crude price positive. The market is also looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories with the API reporting after the bell, where disruptions from Tropical Storm Barry should now have concluded; current expectations see crude stocks -2.6mln bbls, gasoline -1.4mln bbls, and distillates +1mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 3013, NASDAQ-10 -0.5% at 7952, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.1% at 27198, SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary -0.7%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Energy 1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Financials -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care -0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology -0.7%, S&amp;P 500 Materials 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services -0.7%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities -0.8%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) advanced after the co. beat on the top and bottom line, raised EPS and revenue guidance for 2019. Sales of Keytruda, which one of the co.’s headline cancer treatments, posted strong Q/Q gains, with vaccine sales also supporting the co.’s bottom line. Eli Lilly (LLY) moved higher on strong earnings; it beat on top and bottom lines and raised guidance, with desks noting improved diabetes product sales as a bright spot. P&amp;G (PG) moved higher after the co. beat expectations for EPS and revenue, with recent price hikes and decent beauty product sales helping. Pfizer (PFE) continued yesterday’s decline, as banks including Morgan Stanley and BAML signalled concern over the drug maker’s recent spinoff with Mylan. Celgene (CELG) moved a touch lower after the co. posted a big miss on the bottom line but beat on the top and raised FY19 guidance. Illumina Inc (ILMN) fell after posting weak earnings on top and bottom lines and guiding lower than expectations. Altria Group (MO) posted strong earnings, but sunk on downbeat forecasts for cigarette demand, which also saw Philip Morris (PM) lower on the day.<i><strong> </strong></i>Mastercard (MA) traded choppy after the payment’s processor posted earnings that beat on top and bottom lines. Under Armour Corp (AU) were an underperformer after the co. posted disappointing earnings and cut North America guidance. Gartner Inc (IT) despite beating on the top and bottom lines, as guidance was well below expectations. Beyond Meat (BYND) sunk after the co. announced plans for a further stock offering. Other notable stocks advancing after posting strong earnings; AMETEK Inc. (AME), ConocoPhillips (COP), D. R. Horton (DHI), Ecolab Inc. (ECL), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). Other notable stocks falling after posting weaker than expected earnings; GrubHub (GRUB), Corning Inc. (GLW), Dish Network (DISH), Franklin Resources (BEN), Global Payments Inc. (GPN), HCA Healthcare (HCA), Waters Corporation (WAT), Xerox (XRX), Beyond Meat (BYND), Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT), Waste Connections Inc (WCN).</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The energy sector<strong> </strong>outperformed for a few reasons; BP kicked the sector’s earning season off with strong earnings, the XOP ETF broke out to the upside, whilst crude prices were also supportive. Capital One Financial (COF) sunk after the co. revealed it had suffered a data breach affecting 100mln customers. Intel (INTC) was under pressure amid speculation that Google Cloud may be about to switch from Intel to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips, after discovering new issues with its Intel server chips. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) was weighed by reports that the FTC has issued the drug maker a civil subpoena as part of an investigation relating to practises for its arthritis drugs Rheumatoid and Remicade.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:GBP</strong> sunk for a consecutive day, as Asian players digested aggressive comments from UK PM Johnson after the European close on Monday which further upped the anti in UK/EU trade negotiations (Johnson said he will not meet with any EU leaders until they agree to remove backstop). Cable found a floor at 1.2120 as Europeans arrived at their desks, the dip was bought/shorts covered; cable was able to nurse losses and consolidate between 1.2140-1.1280. <strong>USD</strong> was fairly flat, unenthused by slightly weaker than expected Core PCE data/firmer than expected consumer confidence, as participants await the outcome of the FOMC meeting tomorrow. <strong>EUR</strong> was slightly firmer, as the pound weakened overnight. <strong>Antipodeans</strong> fared little better, seeing downside on a souring of risk sentiment that started during the European session and continued into the US, with aggressive tweets regarding China trade negotiations from US President Trump doing little to help. <strong>CAD</strong> was under pressure for similar reasons, but oil prices ultimately proved supportive. Said risk aversion saw <strong>safe havens</strong> in demand; USDJPY retreating from the high 108s and USDCHF moving back and forth below 0.99.</p>",

Said risk aversion saw safe havens in demand; USDJPY retreating from the high 108s and USDCHF moving back and forth below 0.99.</p>",

Before the breakout, analysts at Citi highlighted that prices had remained near the top end of recent trading edges, which it foreshadowed as a potential upside catalyst. The complex had been supported in the European session, where PVM cited positioning factors ahead of the Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, which is likely to see a rate cut and consequently weaken the dollar (in theory), which would be crude price positive. The market is also looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories with the API reporting after the bell, where disruptions from Tropical Storm Barry should now have concluded; current expectations see crude stocks -2.6mln bbls, gasoline -1.4mln bbls, and distillates +1mln bbls.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: The calm before the storm as trade talks and FOMC looms",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Cautious gains were posted by the DXY and broad Dollar as the first day of trade talks in Shanghai went underway, and with the FOMC’s latest policy decision also on the radar (full preview available on the Research Suite). DXY eked mild gains throughout the start of the session and eclipsed yesterday’s peak before revisiting the 98.00 level heading into the US personal income release, which was largely in-line with expectations. DXY looks to conclude the EU session in the slightly in the green.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling extended losses as concerns continue to mount over a no deal Brexit; the pound crashed through heavy barriers at 1.22, to print fresh YTD lows around 1.2120; losses were pared as US traders arrived, with the DXY coming off highs as the FOMC July meeting gets underway. Short covering/profit-taking was also cited for the GBP’s bounce in afternoon trade after the currency slumped to losses of 2% already this week. As a reminder, technical supports to the downside include: 1.2110 (March 17 low), 1.2085 (Jan 17 low), 1.2000 (psychological) and 1.1841 (flash crash low). Meanwhile, the EUR was relatively uneventful, consolidating around 1.1150, and largely shrugged-off mixed inflation data ahead of tomorrow’s EZ Flash CPI and Prelim GDP metrics. EUR/USD is poised to end EU trade around the middle of a 1.1133-60 intraday range.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The marked G10 outperformers with the JPY still feeling support from the BoJ’s policy meeting which failed to satisfy some dovish calls with unchanged policy. As a reminder, the vote split also showed no change from the prior meeting (7-2 to hold policy) despite the recent sources suggesting divergence between board members on the timing of easing. The Yen and Franc later saw safe-haven inflows following a tweet by US President Trump who highlighted China’s hostility during trade talk and noted a tougher deal if China prolongs negotiations. USD/JPY looks set to end EU trade just above the 108.50 level having traded in a 108.45-95 intraday range, whilst CHF heads towards a close with minor gains.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>Subdued on the day on global risk sentiment as risk-sensitive currencies drifted lower in wake of the aforementioned comments by US President Trump, albeit losses in the CAD are somewhat mitigated by firmer oil prices. AUD/USD continues to meander just below the 0.6900 level (0.6875-0.6907 intraday range) whilst its Kiwi counterpart fell further below its 50 DMA (0.6624) to test 0.6600 to the downside. Meanwhile, USD/CAD moves further north of its 200 WMA (1.3115) and eyes 1.3200 to the upside, ahead of its 50 WMA at 1.3243. Looking ahead, Aussie Q2 inflation figures will attract attention following the RBA’s back-to-back cuts earlier in the year; Y/Y is forecast to tick higher to 1.5% from 1.3%.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another positive day for the Turkish Lira with gains inspired by Finance Minister Albayrak, who reassured investors that Turkey will register positive growth this year, and growth will be close to target. Additionally, Albayrak stated that economic activity normalisation will continue with more gravitas next year. USD/TRY tested support at 5.5500 vs. a 5.6210 open and remains close to the bottom of today’s range ahead of the CBRT’s Inflation Report tomorrow. Elsewhere, USD/ZAR saw downside in a move which coincided with the release of a budget balance surplus (vs. prev. deficit) and earnings from state-owned utility company Eskom, which reported a record loss, albeit this was not as large as investors fear. However, the ZAR then pared back gains as Eskom’s CEO signalled that government debt relief talks are still ongoing, an event that rating agencies are eyeing as a key input into rating decisions. USD/ZAR is poised to end the EU session closer to the middle of the intraday 14.1366-2392 band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Unsurprisingly, sectors are all in the red with Energy names outperforming on the aforementioned BP release, with the Co. compromising around 15% of the sector. Other notable movers include Centrica (-13.0%) at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 as both revenue and adj. operating profit missed on the prior figures, though the Co. did caveat this by stating they expect earnings to be weighted towards H2. Separately, Bayer (-3.9%) are also in the red after Q2 revenue missed on Exp. and even though the Co. confirmed outlook this did come with a warning that the outlook is becoming increasingly ambitious for them to achieve. Finally, both Fresenius SE (-2.8%) and Fresenius Medical Care (-6.3%) are under-pressure post earnings with focus being on the Co. anticipating net income growth as flat and as some metrics came in softer than their priors for Q2 respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo (7974 JP) Q1 recurring profits JPY 22.23bln, -49.3%. operating profit JPY 27.43bln, -10.2%.

DXY had earlier eclipsed yesterday’s high (98.17), ahead of the YTD peak at 98.37. Looking ahead on the docket, US PCE could influence a short-term move in the Buck, although sentiment for the currency is largely constrained to trade talks in Shanghai and positioning ahead of the Fed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> More torment for the Pound as further no-deal woes engulf investor sentiment with the latest reports from the Telegraph further solidifying PM Johnson’s hard-line stance. Cable downside was exacerbated during Asia-Pac hours in which the pair retreated below the 1.2200 level for the first time since March 2017 to a current intraday low of 1.2121 (vs. 1.2217 at the open), albeit the pair saw a small bounce in recent trade as the Buck drifted off highs and potentially on some short covering. To the downside, technicians will be eyeing the following levels for support: 1.2110 (March 17 low), 1.2085 (Jan 17 low), 1.2000 (psychological) and 1.1841 (Flash crash low).</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> Firmer on the day in the aftermath of the BoJ Policy Decision in which the Central Bank failed to satisfy some dovish calls by holding its NIRP at -10bps and its 10yr JGB yield target at around 0% whilst maintaining its forward guidance. The vote split also showed no change from the prior meeting (7-2) despite the recent sources suggesting divergence between board members on the timing of easing. USD/JPY currently hovers closer to the bottom of its 108.50-94 range ahead of tis 50 DMA at 108.35. Moreover, today’s NY cut sees 764mln expiring at strike 108.15-25 and around 860mln at 108.00.</p><p><strong>EUR, AUD, NZD -</strong> All largely unchanged intraday and mostly moving at the whim of the Buck, albeit the EUR is again somewhat cushioned by its EUR/GBP cross. EUR/USD remains just under the 1.1150 level and was overall little impacted by slightly cooler Y/Y German state CPIs, which is in-fitting with the National forecast due to be release at 1300BST. Elsewhere, the Antipodeans await developments from US-Sino talks with little to report on a domestic front. AUD/USD and NZD/USD remain within tight ranges (0.6887-6907 and 0.6619-34 respectively), with the latter hovering around its 50DMA (0.6624).</p><p>Australian Building Approvals (Jun) M/M -1.2% vs. Exp. -1.0% (Prev. 0.7%, Rev. 0.3%).

(Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Another largely quiet day for bonds thus far, as markets continue to look ahead to the weeks major risk events with the Fed due to tomorrow. Today has at least provided some data impetus from Germany with the state CPI’s largely printing modestly lower than their priors thus far ahead of the mainland release at 13:00 BST today where the expectations may now be slightly too strong. However, little to no reaction was seen in the <strong>Bund</strong> which currently trades to the middle of the days narrow 14 tick range (174.40-54) at 174.49. Elsewhere, supply from both Italy and Germany with neither notable enough to inspire a move, for reference <strong>BTPs </strong>are a touch softer today but similarly to their core counterpart trade within a slim range. It’s worth highlighting that European stocks have experienced a sell off this morning following a number of poor earnings from heavyweight names such as Bayer, a sell off which has not generated any upside across the fixed complex.

Unsurprisingly, sectors are all in the red with Energy names outperforming on the aforementioned BP release, with the Co. compromising around 15% of the sector. Other notable movers include Centrica (-13.0%) at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 as both revenue and adj. operating profit missed on the prior figures, though the Co. did caveat this by stating they expect earnings to be weighted towards H2. Separately, Bayer (-3.9%) are also in the red after Q2 revenue missed on Exp. and even though the Co. confirmed outlook this did come with a warning that the outlook is becoming increasingly ambitious for them to achieve. Finally, both Fresenius SE (-2.8%) and Fresenius Medical Care (-6.3%) are under-pressure post earnings with focus being on the Co. anticipating net income growth as flat and as some metrics came in softer than their priors for Q2 respectively.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The broad Dollar and Index remains cautious as US-China talks are underway and as participants gear up for tomorrow’s FOMC meeting, with money markets currently pricing in a 78% chance of a 25bps cut and 22% for a 50bps cut to the Fed Fund Rate. DXY had earlier eclipsed yesterday’s high (98.17), ahead of the YTD peak at 98.37. Looking ahead on the docket, US PCE could influence a short-term move in the Buck, although sentiment for the currency is largely constrained to trade talks in Shanghai and positioning ahead of the Fed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - More torment for the Pound as further no-deal woes engulf investor sentiment with the latest reports from the Telegraph further solidifying PM Johnson’s hard-line stance. Cable downside was exacerbated during Asia-Pac hours in which the pair retreated below the 1.2200 level for the first time since March 2017 to a current intraday low of 1.2121 (vs. 1.2217 at the open), albeit the pair saw a small bounce in recent trade as the Buck drifted off highs and potentially on some short covering. To the downside, technicians will be eyeing the following levels for support: 1.2110 (March 17 low), 1.2085 (Jan 17 low), 1.2000 (psychological) and 1.1841 (Flash crash low).</p><p><strong>JPY</strong> - Firmer on the day in the aftermath of the BoJ Policy Decision in which the Central Bank failed to satisfy some dovish calls by holding its NIRP at -10bps and its 10yr JGB yield target at around 0% whilst maintaining its forward guidance. The vote split also showed no change from the prior meeting (7-2) despite the recent sources suggesting divergence between board members on the timing of easing. USD/JPY currently hovers closer to the bottom of its 108.50-94 range ahead of tis 50 DMA at 108.35. Moreover, today’s NY cut sees 764mln expiring at strike 108.15-25 and around 860mln at 108.00.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, AUD, NZD</strong> - All largely unchanged intraday and mostly moving at the whim of the Buck, albeit the EUR is again somewhat cushioned by its EUR/GBP cross. EUR/USD remains just under the 1.1150 level and was overall little impacted by slightly cooler Y/Y German state CPIs, which is in-fitting with the National forecast due to be release at 1300BST. Elsewhere, the Antipodeans await developments from US-Sino talks with little to report on a domestic front. AUD/USD and NZD/USD remain within tight ranges (0.6887-6907 and 0.6619-34 respectively), with the latter hovering around its 50DMA (0.6624).</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p><p>Another largely quiet day for bonds thus far, as markets continue to look ahead to the weeks major risk events with the Fed due to tomorrow. Today has at least provided some data impetus from Germany with the state CPI’s largely printing modestly lower than their priors thus far ahead of the mainland release at 13:00 BST today where the expectations may now be slightly too strong. However, little to no reaction was seen in the <strong>Bund</strong> which currently trades to the middle of the days narrow 14 tick range (174.40-54) at 174.49. Elsewhere, supply from both Italy and Germany with neither notable enough to inspire a move, for reference BTPs are a touch softer today but similarly to their core counterpart trade within a slim range. It’s worth highlighting that European stocks have experienced a sell off this morning following a number of poor earnings from heavyweight names such as Bayer, a sell off which has not generated any upside across the fixed complex. Finally, and painting a similar pattern <strong>USTs</strong> are relatively unchanged though we do get the PCE release later on today which may garner increased focus ahead&nbsp; of tomorrows FOMC meeting.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Brent</strong> and <strong>WTI</strong> prices are firmer this morning, and currently trade just below the USD 64.50/bbl and USD 57.50/bbl marks respectively.

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%)</strong> conformed to the mild optimism despite further liquidity inaction by the PBoC as focus turned to the resumption of US-China trade talks in Shanghai today. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded sideways with price action indecisive heading into today’s BoJ policy conclusion where the central bank kept policy settings unchanged as expected but also maintained its forward guidance which disappointed some outside calls for a potential dovish tweak.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> initially extended on this week’s upside but was then stalled by resistance ahead of the 109.00 handle and later pressured after the BoJ disappointed outside calls for a dovish tweak to forward guidance, while antipodeans were uneventful amid a firmer greenback in which <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> barely held on to the 0.6900 level, not helped by a larger than expected contraction in Building Approvals.</p><p>Australian Building Approvals (Jun) M/M -1.2% vs. Exp. -1.0% (Prev. 0.7%, Rev. 0.3%).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was contained by a firmer greenback and with participants tentative ahead of tomorrow’s FOMC, while <strong>copper</strong> only marginally benefitted from the risk appetite as it took a breather following the prior day’s advances in which it broke through near-term resistance at the USD 2.70/lb level.</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>Iran Navy Commander Khanzadi said they will expand military ties with Russia and announced an agreement for joint naval exercise in the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasuries moved higher to start the week, taking their cues from falling global yields and in anticipation of a Fed rate cut on Wednesday, in addition to the uncertainty from US-China trade talks in the next few days. No-deal Brexit fears surged as UK PM Johnson doubled down on the threat of a no-deal, just another global risk adding credence to central bank easing. US investors are also likely to be concerned by the evident slowdown in global manufacturing, which seeped into Friday’s US Q2 GDP data, despite the consumer segment remaining robust. At settlement the curve had flattened modestly (2s10s approximately 1bps narrower), with yields down between 1.5bps and 2.5bps. Elsewhere, US treasury said it borrowed (USD) 40bln in Q2 and that it expects to issue 433bln worth of debt in Q3 (higher than the prior 160bln estimate) and 381bln in Q4 of this year. US T-note futures (U9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 127-14+.</p><p><strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reportedly told colleagues House Speaker Pelosi assured him she will bring up USMCA for a vote by October</strong>, <strong>although Pelosi's office was said to have denied she gave any assurances on timing for a vote</strong>.

        "subject": "Preview: BoJ expected to keep policy unchanged today and will also release its latest Outlook Report",
        "content": "<p>The BoJ will conclude its 2-day policy meeting on Tuesday in which the central bank is expected to maintain its policy settings of QQE with Yield Curve Control to flexibly target 10yr yields at around 0% and keep negative interest rate policy at -0.10%. Furthermore, the central bank is anticipated to reaffirm forward guidance of keeping rates at extremely low rates at least through to Spring 2020 although there are many calls for a potential tweak in guidance, and the BoJ will also release its latest Outlook Report containing board members' forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI.</p><p>Despite expectations for the BoJ to stand pat, recent source reports suggested BoJ officials were split on whether to loosen monetary policy at this meeting or delay action as many at the bank see no immediate requirement for ramping up policy support while others are concerned that delaying could trigger an unwelcome strengthening of the JPY against the greenback, especially considering that markets are pricing in a Fed rate cut at this week's FOMC. Sources have also noted that there has been a discussion on enhancing forward guidance but some officials have expressed doubt over potency of stronger guidance, while cutting rates further is said to be one option for the BoJ although the banking industry would be widely against this as NIRP has already squeezed their profits.</p><p>In terms of the recent central bank rhetoric, BoJ Governor Kuroda reiterated they will be patiently maintaining powerful monetary easing to achieve the price target and stated the BoJ will look at economics, prices and the financial conditions available until the very last minute of the debating decision in regards to this month's meeting, while he also suggested that they will consider easing swiftly if momentum for hitting the price goal is lost and that with zero lower bound for short-term interest rates, it might be better to directly affect long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases.</p><p>However, Kuroda has also noted that there is no change to the view that the nation's economy is growing moderately, while he has stated that it is not easy to continue powerful measures for a long time and that it may take time to overcome entrenched low inflation even with powerful monetary easing. These mixed comments therefore suggest the BoJ are unlikely to make policy adjustments in near term but stand ready to move if required, while many also see further easing to be premature as the bank may want to save its tools for a more drastic scenario such as if the economy suffers from the looming sales tax hike.</p><p>Comments from other BoJ officials also support a wait and see approach as BoJ Deputy Governor Amamiya stated that the central bank's main scenario is still for the economy to expand moderately and inflation to accelerate to the 2% target, while board member Funo sees no need to ease policy for now and advocated for sufficiently low rates to be maintained for a prolonged period as prices and inflation expectations have not heightened much.</p><p>The latest data from Japan has been mixed including the BoJ Tankan survey in which headline Large Manufacturing Index missed estimates at 7 vs. Exp. 9 (Prev. 12) although the Large Non-Manufacturing Index topped forecasts at 23 vs. Exp. 20, while Japanese Trade Balance surprised with a larger than expected surplus but Imports and Exports have contracted wider than forecast at -5.2% vs. Exp. -0.4% and -6.7% vs. Exp. -5.6% respectively. These varied releases therefore support the case that there is no urgent need to act and that the BoJ has room to remain patient.</p><p>As usual, there is no exact scheduled release time for the BoJ announcement which tends to be anytime after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT. Focus will also be on the statement as there are outside calls the BoJ could tweak its forward guidance to suggest rates will remain lower considerably beyond Spring 2020, although there are mixed views of the impact this dovish tweak could cause as some suggested markets may interpret this as the BoJ running out of tools or conviction to act, while the Outlook Report will also be eyed in which further reductions of inflation and growth forecasts are seen as likely.</p><p>Previous Outlook Report</p><p>Real GDP</p><ul><li>Fiscal 2019 forecast cut to 0.8 from 0.9%.</li><li>Fiscal 2020 forecast cut to 0.9% from 1.0%.</li><li>Fiscal 2021 forecast at 1.2%.</li></ul><p>Core CPI</p><ul><li>Fiscal 2019 forecast maintained at 0.9% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</li><li>Fiscal 2020 forecast cut to 1.3% from 1.4% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</li><li>Fiscal 2021 forecast at 1.6%.</li></ul><p>Recent Comments and Calls&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Japanese PM Abe adviser Hamada said if Fed acts the BoJ may need to do something for JPY and is concerned of USD/JPY nearing 100.00.</li><li>Goldman Sachs thinks BoJ will broadly maintain its economic recovery view but will likely provide a more stern warning on downside risks.</li><li>Morgan Stanley sees the BoJ easing further sometime from July-September by extending its forward guidance of keeping low rates to end-2020.</li><li>Rabobank said BoJ will likely lower its inflation forecast of 1.1% for the year ending March 2020 and growth projections could also be lowered given the increasing concerns about the global economy.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equities shrugged off the lacklustre lead from their global peers to trade higher across the board, but with gains mostly modest as there was not much in terms of fresh catalysts and as markets await the looming risk events. ASX 200 (+0.4%) gained from the open with continued strength in telecoms leading the index to unprecedented highs, while the Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) has ignored disappointing Industrial Production data and what has so far been a predominantly softer earnings season, with outperformance in the index fuelled by recent currency weakness. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) conform to the mild optimism despite further liquidity inaction by the PBoC as focus turns to the resumption of US-China trade talks in Shanghai today.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY was slightly firmer as it continued to prod above the recently reclaimed 98.00 level ahead of an anticipated less aggressive move by the Fed at tomorrow’s FOMC and amid a mostly subdued tone in its major counterparts in which EUR/USD pulled back from resistance at 1.1150. GBP/USD also continues on its underperformance with the selling exacerbated on a break below the 1.2200 level for the first time since March 2017 with analysts touting that sellers will now have their sights next on the March 2017 low at 1.2110, while the latest Brexit headlines don’t seem to bode well for the currency as UK PM Johnson reportedly will not meet with EU leaders until they agree to remove the backstop. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially extended on this week’s upside but was then stalled by resistance ahead of the 109.00 handle with focus now shifting to the looming BoJ announcement, while antipodeans are uneventful amid a firmer greenback with AUD/USD barely holding on to the 0.6900 level not helped by soft Building Approvals data which showed a larger than expected contraction.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs trade sideways with price action indecisive ahead of today’s BoJ policy conclusion where the central bank is expected to keep policy settings unchanged.</p>",
