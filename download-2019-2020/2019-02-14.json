In related news, China is said to be counting on promises of large purchases of semiconductors as well as other US goods to soothe trade tensions and secure an extension to the tariff truce. (SCMP/WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEC Director Kudlow stated that no decision has been made on extending deadline and the &lsquo;vibe&rsquo; in talks in Beijing has been good, while he added that trade negotiators are to meet with Chinese President Xi tomorrow. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China State Council said they are to improve targeted RRR cut policy under inclusive finance. (Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Parliament rejected Labour amendment &ldquo;A&rdquo; which would have called for a full &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; by February 27th or the government would have to state that there is no longer a deal. Parliament also rejected the Blackford amendment &ldquo;I&rdquo; which would have extended Article 50 by at least 3 months, while the UK government Brexit motion was also defeated which would have given parliamentary backing for PM May&#39;s plan to seek changes to her Brexit deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s office said that due to the Labour party voting against the government, they are making a no-deal Brexit more likely, while it added that the government will continue to seek legally binding changes to the Irish backstop with the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Labour Leader Corbyn is said hold talks with EU Chief Negotiater Barnier next week. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested the message is that there is a majority for the Malthouse compromise, but government needs to work with its backbenchers rather than against them, according to The Telegraph&rsquo;s Political Editor. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said he does not believe no deal Brexit will happen. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Vlieghe said he considers appropriate pace of monetary tightening is somewhat slower and the degree of future monetary tightening will in part depend on how large GBP appreciation is. Furthermore, Vlieghe commented that easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy response than tightening in the event of a no-deal Brexit, while around 25bps hike per year bank rate path seems a reasonable central case if a deal is made.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate Majority leader McConnell said President Trump is prepared to sign border security legislation and indicated to declare national emergency to build the wall. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate Minority leader Schumer said border deal is a reasonable compromise and later commented that if President Trump declares national emergency on border, it will be a gross abuse of power and contempt of law, while House Speaker Pelosi said they may file a legal challenge if President Trump declares a national emergency.

Cisco (CSCO) opened higher after strong earnings, as well as raising its dividend and share repurchase programme. Equinix (EQIX), Marathon Oil (MRO), IQVIA (IQV), Vulcan Materials (VMC), Zoetis (ZTS), Incyte (INCY) all outperformed after the market took fondly to their earnings reports. Conversely, Century Link (CTL), American International Group (AIG), NetApp (NTAP), MGM Resorts (MGM), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) all underperformed following disappointing earnings reports. Apple (AAPL) has begun reselling older iPhone models in Germany, but only models with Qualcomm (QCOM) chips. Chipmakers benefitted from reports that China is to make large purchases of US semiconductors to ease trade tensions. SPX -0.27% at 2746, NASDAQ +0.09% at 7022, DJI -0.41% at 25439.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries traded higher on Thursday as US growth concerns were amplified by a negative print of retail sales for December, which decreased by 1.2%, the worst reading in nine years. The move in the 10-year was exacerbated by a block steepening trade where real money reportedly bought 18k+ TYH9, whilst selling 4k Ultra Bonds. However, dovish comments from Fed&rsquo;s Brainard, who mentioned curtailing the balance sheet normalisation process this year, and NEC Director Kudlow saying there were &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; in the retail sales figure were a headwind for treasury prices. Going into the close, the front-to-belly of the curve flattened, whilst the belly-to-long end of the curve steepened, with the 5s/30s steepening by c. 2.5bps. US T-note futures (H9) settled 13+ ticks higher at 122-05+.</p>\r\n",

The Bill would keep the govt funded through 30 September 2019. The House is set to vote on the Bill on Thursday, and the Senate is expected to vote before the deadline. In terms of the reaction, risk asset struggled to rally, with some noting that declaring a national emergency for a construction project was a negative, and may harden lawmakers stance on Trump&rsquo;s legislative agenda, since the declaration circumvents the wishes of Congress. Additionally, House Speaker Pelosi has already barked back, saying the situation at the border was not an emergency, and the Democrats may file a legal challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US/China trade talks continued in Beijing today between officials from the world&rsquo;s two largest economies, with hints that Chinese President Xi may meet the US delegation on Friday, potentially signalling the progress made in talks. Although sentiment was tilted negatively in early trade, following reports that trade teams were &ldquo;far apart&rdquo; on reform demands, later reports went on to say that there had been key discussions on removing the 10% tariffs the US had previously imposed. China is looking to make large purchases of semiconductors and other US goods in efforts to reduce tension, the WSJ reported; and is also seeking for bipartisan talks to be held in order to resolve the case of the extradition of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO. It is worth noting that NEC Director Kudlow said that there had been no decision made on extending the March 1st deadline, but the &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; had been good; however, Kudlow is known for his optimistic remarks. Pre-market, Trump said he could potentially extend the deadline for an additional 60 days, contingent on progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May lost her motion vote today by a margin of 303 to 258. The vote would have given her Parliamentary endorsement to head back to Brussels to seek changes to the Brexit deal, and endeavour now made more difficult to gain cooperation from the EU. The Tory rebel ERG group were partly responsible for her defeat, after they chose to abstain the vote as the motion would have ruled out a no-deal Brexit option. Further division across parliament was evident, where the Blackford amendment and Labour amendments were both rejected too (handing the government a small victory); the Blackford amendment would have extended Article 50 by at least three months and the Labour amendment would have called for a full &ldquo;meaningful vote&rdquo; by February 27th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Brainard (voter, dovish) said the balance sheet size normalisation process should come to an end this year, adding that the balance sheet should have a comfortable buffer on top of reserve requirements. She stressed data dependence, saying that the Fed has to wait and see now, as solid growth is in the outlook and the labour market data supports that, but risks to the downgrade have grown. More specifically, she said December retail sales &ldquo;caught her eye&rdquo; but payroll numbers are still good. Looking broader, Brainard said there are a variety of downside risks, and she is attentive to those, mentioning the slowing of growth in China and Europe, high policy uncertainty and the tightening of financial conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES: </strong>US Retail Sales decreased by 1.2% in MM in December, below both the expected rise of 0.2% and the previous 0.2% (which was revised lower to 0.1%). Pantheon Macroeconomics said &quot;these numbers are astonishing, and impossible to square with the Redbook chainstore sales survey, which reported surging sales in December and a record high in the week of Christmas, on the back of the plunge in gasoline prices,&quot; and Pantheon argues that drawing a connection between the retail sales numbers and the fall in stock prices does not address the yawning gap between the official numbers and the Redbook. &quot;The reported drop in sales is concentrated in department stores, down 3.3%, with furniture down 1.3%. Electronics sales were little changed, while clothing fell 0.7%. These data are so wild that we have to expect hefty upward revisions, but if they stand, they are very unlikely to be representative of the trend over the next few months. The consumer is no longer enjoying tax cuts or falling gas prices, but that&rsquo;s no reason to expect a rollover.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: SOMA</strong> Day on 15 February: SOMA day could lend strength to the US dollar, Nordea argues. USD 43.5bln of US bonds on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet will mature, and the central bank will allow USD 23.3bln of excess liquidity to shrink, according to Nordea. &quot;Whether we have looked at it daily or weekly, it looks as if SOMA days can be good news for the USD,&quot; Nordea says, &quot;and the bigger the shrink, the larger the negative effect on equities and the greater positive effect on the USD.&quot; The bank points out that &quot;of the seven weeks when the balance sheet has shrunk by more than 20bn, the dollar has weakened twice &ndash; but then by less than 0.1% on the week (Wednesday to Wednesday),&quot; adding that &quot;the weekly QT patterns thus suggest a move higher in the USD between Wednesday February 13 and Wednesday February 20, given the hefty SOMA day on February 15&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.51 HIGHER AT USD 54.41/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.96 HIGHER AT USD 64.57/BBL.</strong> The energy complex came off best levels seen overnight - dampened by weak GDP data out of the Eurozone earlier in the session - but held in positive territory amid ongoing trade optimism and on lower supply forecasts for Saudi. In fact, Citi continues &ldquo;to view Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s intention to reduce production to 9.8mln BPD for March as the most significant fundamental change for the week&rdquo;; if this was the case, output would fall by 0.5mln BPD below its OPEC+ target. In news commentary, Russian Energy Minister Novak stated there are no proposals as of yet to lift oil production due to tail risk from Venezuela while adding that Moscow are aiming to cut February output ahead of schedule. Also, Russia&#39;s Gazprom Neft CEO said it plans to increase oil production by 2% in 2019, he believes current prices are justified though prices above USD 70-80/bbl are not sustainable in the long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.27% at 2746, NASDAQ +0.09% at 7022, DJI -0.41% at 25439. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.15%, Materials -0.56%, Industrials -0.59%, Cons Discretionary -0.43%, Cons Staples -1.22%, Healthcare +0.23%, Financials -1.17%, Tech +0.12%, Telecoms +0.21%, Utilities -0.31%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Coca-Cola (KO) opened lower after guiding EPS below expectations and reporting a decline in volumes in North America. Cisco (CSCO) opened higher after strong earnings, as well as raising its dividend and share repurchase programme. Equinix (EQIX), Marathon Oil (MRO), IQVIA (IQV), Vulcan Materials (VMC), Zoetis (ZTS), Incyte (INCY) all outperformed after the market took fondly to their earnings reports. Conversely, Century Link (CTL), American International Group (AIG), NetApp (NTAP), MGM Resorts (MGM), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) all underperformed following disappointing earnings reports. Apple (AAPL) has begun reselling older iPhone models in Germany, but only models with Qualcomm (QCOM) chips. Chipmakers benefitted from reports that China is to make large purchases of US semiconductors to ease trade tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 13+ TICKS HIGHER AT 122-05+. </strong>Treasuries traded higher on Thursday as US growth concerns were amplified by a negative print of retail sales for December, which decreased by 1.2%, the worst reading in nine years. The move in the 10-year was exacerbated by a block steepening trade where real money reportedly bought 18k+ TYH9, whilst selling 4k Ultra Bonds. However, dovish comments from Fed&rsquo;s Brainard, who mentioned curtailing the balance sheet normalisation process this year, and NEC Director Kudlow saying there were &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; in the retail sales figure were a headwind for treasury prices. Going into the close, the front-to-belly of the curve flattened, whilst the belly-to-long end of the curve steepened, with the 5s/30s steepening by c. 2.5bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>In stark contrast to yesterday when CPI revived the Greenback&rsquo;s fortunes, US data in the shape of Retail Sales, PPI and Initial Claims all missed consensus. Hence, the index fell out of favour, or off its latest 2019 perch and slipped to a marginal new intraday low at 96.940 before finding its feet again, partly due to the demise of others, but also amidst reports that China is pledging to buy US semiconductors and other items in an effort to ease trade angst and ensure that the tariff truce is extended. Note, the DXY remains below best levels (97.291), but could get another lift on Friday as SOMA demand is reportedly the 2nd biggest on record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, GBP: </strong>The Loonie was hit even harder than its US counterpart by a combination of weaker than expected Canadian manufacturing sales and a pull-back in oil prices, with Usd/Cad rebounding relatively sharply to circa 1.3330 from 1.3250 and roughly 1.3230 at one stage. However, the Pound is keeping the Loonie company at the base of the G10 ranks ahead of another Brexit showdown in Parliament and dovish leaning BoE comments courtesy of Vlieghe. Indeed, Cable has now lost grip of 1.2800 having held above the round number and chart support (55 DMA at 1.2813) at the first time of asking, and is now eyeing bids down at 1.2740.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD:</strong> The Kiwi is back in the ascendancy and extending gains vs the Usd and Aud, with the headline pair back up towards the top of a 0.6855-0.6795 range and the cross slipping further below 1.0400, as Aud/Usd fails to sustain overnight momentum on better than forecast Chinese trade data and retreats to 0.7085 vs 0.7130 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR, CHF:</strong> All beneficiaries of the aforementioned post-data Dollar dip, with Usd/Jpy reversing to almost 110.50 from new ytd peaks of 111.12 and the single currency back up above 1.1300 vs 1.1250 at one stage before the NY cut when decent option expiries (1.3 bn) at the strike ran off. Meanwhile, the Franc pared losses from a whisker off 1.1000 towards 1.0060, shrugging off deflationary Swiss producer/import prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Amidst widespread losses/underperformance vs the Dollar, Eskom, sanctions and worrying data exacerbated Rand, Rouble and Lira woes with Usd/Zar up over 14.2000, Usd/Rub above 67.0000 and Usd/Try 5.3000+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>SEB says: &quot;Governor Olsen to maintain a hawkish bias in Annual Address. Norges Bank&rsquo;s Olsen will hold his Annual Address to the central bank&rsquo;s Supervisory Council and invited guests on February 14. While there are always hopes that the governor will reveal any new policy hints, this is not the norm. The address aims at highlighting long-term and structural economic policy challenges. In his 2018 address, Olsen repeated the message from the previous MPR, but also emphasised the bank&rsquo;s growth-over-inflation focus and that a rate hike was looming. This was an unusually clear and transparent message intended to adjust households&rsquo; interest rate expectations. We expect the governor to paint an upbeat picture of the Norwegian economy in the upcoming speech. Considering that the bank has highlighted heightened global uncertainty, it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to see Olsen focusing on global economic and political developments and implications for the Norwegian economy. Further policy deliberations on the balancing act between weaker and uncertain global developments vs. the solid Norwegian outlook would be useful. Most of all, however, we would like the governor to stand firm and maintain the bank&rsquo;s hawkish bias.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Scotiabank offers reasons why US December retail sales data may have been so soft: Weather, the government shutdown, sampling, stock prices",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Weather: </strong>December 8&ndash;10th saw the 3rd largest snowstorm in history for a month of December across much of the southeastern and eastern seaboard of the US. The storms hit the southern plains through the southeast and even included 10 inches of snow getting dumped in parts of Texas. One foot of snow fell through parts of the Carolinas and Virginia resulting in declarations of emergency and power outages (here). Another major storm disrupted travel along the eastern seaboard just days ahead of Christmas and again into peak shopping season. Blame Mother Nature.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>The government shutdown: </strong>This began on December 22nd and hence three days before Christmas right in the mad dash to fill stockings. It lasted until January 25th. The impact upon consumer spending could have been material through direct channels (ie: furloughed government workers not getting paid and uncertain about when their next paycheque will arrive) and indirectly through the confidence hit on many others dismayed toward the state of affairs in Washington and the market effects. Blame Trump.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Sampling: </strong>this being the advance report and a delayed one at that, I suspect revision risk may be high into the next estimate for December. Retail sales can often be heavily revised. While the Census Bureau states that response rates were at or above normal levels for this release, data collection and processing were delayed by the shutdown. This may be pure conjecture, or it may be prudent caution toward a process that was delayed and resulting in an uncertain quality of the responses. Recall that the advance estimate is based upon a small subset of the total retail space. Even in normal times, the 90% confidence interval on this report is +/- 1.6 percentage points (here). In abnormal times when one might prudently question data collection and overall accuracy, the scope for sampling error could well be much higher even compared to what&rsquo;s normal.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Brought forward sales: </strong>retail sales were up 7.3% q/q SAAR in Q2 and 4.3% in Q3. They ended up 1.8% in Q4. The moderating pattern fits the theory that the distributions related to the TCJA would put consumption on a sugar high temporarily and at the expense of later figures. We&#39;re in that patch now. That doesn&#39;t mean recession. That means brought forward momentum into a soft patch while core drivers like jobs and income gains remain strong and could well support a return to modest consumption growth. By way of comparison, I believe Canada&rsquo;s consumer story is a leading example of the US story in that Canada offered tax cuts to middle-income earners and a huge increase in child transfers amounting to thousands of dollars per child (tax free) that juiced consumption temporarily and then drove it into a soft patch among other drivers.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Stocks: </strong>The S&amp;P500 fell by about 20% from early October through to the low point in late December, with almost 16% of that 20% drop occurring from early December onward. Stocks have since rebounded into January and are presently only about 6% off the high in late September and early October. Is retail weakness a reflection of the stock market drop in a sudden negative wealth effect? Maybe, but I doubt it. Wealth effects usually require longer lived corrections and lagged effects, but the rebound in January may suggest stability in terms of this possible driver. The December meltdown was correlated with the shutdown and US-China effects and so be careful about double counting shutdown effects on confidence and the market effects, plus other considerations like tax loss selling especially in tech stocks, the story on Trump threatening to fire Powell and algo trading during thin holiday markets. If there was a sudden negative wealth effect on consumption, then expect it to stabilize to the extent to which stocks have improved this year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast to yesterday when CPI revived the Greenback&rsquo;s fortunes, US data in the shape of Retail Sales, PPI and Initial Claims all missed consensus. Hence, the index fell out of favour, or off its latest 2019 perch and slipped to a marginal new intraday low at 96.940 before finding its feet again, partly due to the demise of others, but also amidst reports that China is pledging to buy US semiconductors and other items in an effort to ease trade angst and ensure that the tariff truce is extended. Note, the DXY remains below best levels (97.291), but could get another lift on Friday as SOMA demand is reportedly the 2nd biggest on record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie was hit even harder than its US counterpart by a combination of weaker than expected Canadian manufacturing sales and a pull-back in oil prices, with Usd/Cad rebounding relatively sharply to circa 1.3330 from 1.3250 and roughly 1.3230 at one stage. However, the Pound is keeping the Loonie company at the base of the G10 ranks ahead of another Brexit showdown in Parliament and dovish leaning BoE comments courtesy of Vlieghe. Indeed, Cable has now lost grip of 1.2800 having held above the round number and chart support (55 DMA at 1.2813) at the first time of asking, and is now eyeing bids down at 1.2740.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is back in the ascendancy and extending gains vs the Usd and Aud, with the headline pair back up towards the top of a 0.6855-0.6795 range and the cross slipping further below 1.0400, as Aud/Usd fails to sustain overnight momentum on better than forecast Chinese trade data and retreats to 0.7085 vs 0.7130 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All beneficiaries of the aforementioned post-data Dollar dip, with Usd/Jpy reversing to almost 110.50 from new ytd peaks of 111.12 and the single currency back up above 1.1300 vs 1.1250 at one stage before the NY cut when decent option expiries (1.3 bn) at the strike ran off. Meanwhile, the Franc pared losses from a whisker off 1.1000 towards 1.0060, shrugging off deflationary Swiss producer/import prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Swedish Krona has reversed significantly from best levels vs the Eur and is back below 10.5000 after somewhat mixed jobs data as the NSA and SA employment rates essentially crossed paths (former up to 6.5% from 6% and latter down to 6% from 6.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst widespread losses/underperformance vs the Dollar, Eskom, sanctions and worrying data exacerbated Rand, Rouble and Lira woes with Usd/Zar up over 14.2000, Usd/Rub above 67.0000 and Usd/Try 5.3000+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PRIMER: Spanish Budget and Snap Election",
        "content": "<p>As widely touted, the Spanish Parliament rejected the government&rsquo;s 2019 budget proposal on Wednesday. 17 lawmakers on the Catalan side voted against the budget, despite attempts by PM Sanchez to win their support. The Premier was also pursuing negotiations with the Catalonians, though the side refused to hold talks without dialogue of a new independence. Early on Thursday, Spain&rsquo;s Finance Minister Calvino downplayed the seriousness of the budget rejection by stating that the block does not necessarily mean there will be consequences, ahead of PM Sanchez&rsquo;s cabinet meeting on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources earlier in the week noted that if the budget was rejected, then Sanchez will call a snap election, HSBC reiterated this by noting &ldquo;several ministers have said a budget rejection would make snap polling this year inevitable, possibly in May.&quot; Furthermore, Morgan Stanley highlighted that local media suggests that the timing of a snap election could coincide with the European elections on May 26th. Dates for the elections were not officially discussed or set in stone, though sources floated around April 14th and 28th as possible options and Budget Minister Montero confirmed elections will take place at some point this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elections could result in three possible scenarios:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Right-wing government (PP and Cuidadanos with support of VOX): Likely</li>\r\n  <li>Left-wing government (PSOE and Podemos): Less likely</li>\r\n  <li>Political gridlock: Likely</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at recent polls, PSOE leads with around 24% of votes, while the two large right-wing parties, PP and Ciudadanos follow with circa 20% and 18% respectively. Meanwhile, Podemos has around 14% of vote, ahead of VOX at about 10%.ING sees a left-wing government as the least likely outcome. Polls so far suggest that a snap election may deliver a hung Parliament. MS also highlights that seat projections show that a left-wing government is unlikely, however, both MS and ING note that a coalition between PP and Ciudadanos with the support of the right-wing party (i.e VOX) is likely, based on polls, with MS predicting it could get over 50% of the seats. On the downside, ING caveats this by stating &ldquo;This coalition would be much harder on the Catalans. Tensions between the central government and Catalonia are likely to increase in this scenario.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of an economic outlook, the banks all agree that Spain is growing at a fast pace, despite many expectations of a slowdown. HSBC cites the recent sharp fall in energy prices as the buoy for domestic consumption, adding that Spain usually has a higher inflation impact due to lower taxes and expectations are for the country to grow &ldquo;well above the eurozone average&rdquo;. MS comes across slightly more neutral, stating that risks are rising but more around a fiscal slippage this year rather than political angst, &ldquo;However, these fiscal risks shouldn&#39;t be large enough to put Spain&#39;s exit from its Excessive Deficit Procedure at risk&rdquo;. MS remains bullish on Bonos over the medium term but warn that volatility might rise.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.1%) was relatively flat following a deluge of earnings releases although the energy sector outperformed after the recent gains in crude prices, while Nikkei 225 (flat) was also flimsy due to mixed GDP data and a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) declined at the open following another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC and amid tentativeness heading into the key trade data which was expected to show continued ill-effects from the US-China trade dispute. Chinese stocks then only partially recovered despite the data topping estimates across the board with many wary due to Lunar New Year distortions and as the data also showed imports from US fell by 41.2% Y/Y, while reports that President Trump was mulling a 60-day extension to the tariff deadline was only gradual in its support. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher following the less than inspiring Japanese GDP data which despite showing that Japan&rsquo;s economy returned to an expansion, the headline Q/Q growth fell short of estimates and there were also downward revisions to the prior readings. Furthermore, the BoJ were present in the market for JPY 580bln of JGBs with the bulk concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to weigh 60-day extension for tariff deadline according to sources, while there had been earlier comments from President Trump that the trade deal with China is going very well.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The degree of future monetary tightening will in part depend on how large GBP appreciation is</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy response than a tightening</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- If a Brexit deal is made, a path of Bank Rate that involves around one quarter point hike per year seems a reasonable central case</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- As before, this future rate path is a forecast not a promise, and just as there is considerable uncertainty around the forecast for growth and inflation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The BoE would hike rates after a no-deal Brexit if needed, even if it is politically unpopular</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish Budget Minister Calvino says the budget bloc does not necessarily mean there will be consequences, and that the cabinet are to discuss the budgets defeat tomorrow.

Sectors are also predominantly in positive territory, although there is some slight underperformance in Financial names; weighed on by the likes of Credit Suisse (-1.4%) who have moved lower following earnings, where they proposed a dividend of CHF 0.26 vs. Exp. CHF 0.30. Other notable movers include, AstraZeneca (+4.9%) who are higher after their earnings beat on expectations, with Legrand (+7.9%) also in the green after earnings. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Telenet (-4.4%) who&rsquo;s full-year operating profit missed expectations. Elsewhere, Wirecard (+7.4%) are higher, with latest reports in German press suggesting that short sellers were aware about the FT article relating to the Co before it&rsquo;s publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is reportedly mulling potential retaliatory tariffs for US products including Tesla (TSLA) electric cars; according to WiWo.

In early EU trade, Russian Energy Minister Novak noted that there are no proposals as of yet to lift oil production due to tail risk from Venezuela. Furthermore, Novak stated that Moscow are aiming to cut February output ahead of schedule. Overnight, Chinese trade balance numbers were released wherein imports of crude in January topped 10mln BPD, +5% Y/Y/. ING notes that despite the Y/Y increase, this is still off from record levels seen at the back-end of 2018; 10.48mln BPD in November and 10.35mln BPD in December, &ldquo;the very strong imports seen towards the end of last year seem to reflect refiners using their import quota licences before the end of the year&rdquo; says ING.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals are relatively mixed with gold (Unch) flat ahead of the widely watched trade talks in Beijing.

An even more pronounced rebound in Bunds (breaching 166.24-26 and now testing the next upside chart resistance zone between 166.38-43) will likely have impacted, especially given some spill-over upside in US Treasuries as well, but Gilts also face a formidable technical hurdle around 124.44-45, not to mention looming supply as the DMO offers Gbp2.25 bn 2028 paper today. Meanwhile, 3 month contracts are relatively lacklustre at 0.5-1.5 ticks above par awaiting comments from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe at the bottom of the hour.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.1%) was relatively flat following a deluge of earnings releases although the energy sector outperformed after the recent gains in crude prices, while Nikkei 225 (flat) was also flimsy due to mixed GDP data and a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) declined at the open following another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC and amid tentativeness heading into the key trade data which was expected to show continued ill-effects from the US-China trade dispute. Chinese stocks then only partially recovered despite the data topping estimates across the board with many wary due to Lunar New Year distortions and as the data also showed imports from US fell by 41.2% Y/Y, while reports that President Trump was mulling a 60-day extension to the tariff deadline was only gradual in its support. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher following the less than inspiring Japanese GDP data which despite showing that Japan&rsquo;s economy returned to an expansion, the headline Q/Q growth fell short of estimates and there were also downward revisions to the prior readings. Furthermore, the BoJ were present in the market for JPY 580bln of JGBs with the bulk concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to weigh 60-day extension for tariff deadline according to sources, while there had been earlier comments from President Trump that the trade deal with China is going very well.

Elsewhere, price action in USD/JPY largely reflected the indecisive risk tone and antipodeans attempted to recover loss ground and were later underpinned by hopes of a potential extension to the tariff deadline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly rangebound amid an indecisive risk tone overnight although there were mild gains observed in the complex as Chinese trade data proved to be better than many had feared, which helped WTI crude futures sustain the prior day&rsquo;s strength with support provided near the USD 54.00/bbl level. Elsewhere, gold found some reprieve from yesterday&rsquo;s losses amid a muted greenback, while copper also eked mild gains alongside similar cautious gains amongst its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China customs stated that January iron ore imports 91.26mln tons vs. Prev. 86.64mln tons M/M and January copper imports incl. semis 479k tons vs. Prev. 420k tons, while Natgas imports were reportedly at the highest on record.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries sold off on Wednesday &ndash; seeing the US 10-year yield break through 2.70% - as risk appetite grew on China trade progress and hopes a government shutdown would be avoided. Corporate issuance saw USD 11.85bln raised in the market, following on from yesterday&rsquo;s USD 16.3bln, also adding to the sell off. The yield curve flattened today with spreads contracting between all maturities, the most profound being the 2s/30s and 5s/30s which both flattened by c. 2.3bps. US T-note futures (H9) settled 6+ ticks at 121-24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he would look for &quot;land mines&quot; in the government funding bill but doesn&#39;t want to see a shutdown and will make decision to sign it or not when he gets it. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Republican Senator Graham said President Trump is &quot;inclined&quot; to sign bipartisan funding bill if provisions on barriers and beds are as he expects, while he added President Trump will look for additional border wall funds and is &quot;very inclined&quot; to declare a national emergency.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as the momentum from Wall St, where stocks notched a 4th consecutive gain and extended on YTD highs, was counterbalanced by cautiousness ahead of the looming Chinese trade data. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is marginally positive as participants digest a slew of earnings releases and with outperformance in the energy sector after the recent gains in crude prices, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) just about remains afloat with sentiment flimsy due to mixed GDP data and a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch,) opened lower amid tentativeness following another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC and ahead of the key Chinese trade data which is expected to show continued ill-effects from the US-China trade dispute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is stable and holds on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains after yesterday&rsquo;s firmer than expected inflation data supported a reclaim of the 97.00 level, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain lacklustre after having relinquished the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively. Elsewhere, price action in USD/JPY largely reflects the indecisive risk tone and antipodeans attempt to recover from the prior session&rsquo;s lost ground but with the rebound restricted by the impending Chinese data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher following the less than inspiring GDP data which despite showing that Japan&rsquo;s economy returned to an expansion, the headline Q/Q growth fell short of estimates and there were also downward revisions to the prior readings. Furthermore, the BoJ are also in the market for JPY 580bln of JGBs with the bulk concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
