At the Press conference (with US President Trump, China Vice Premier Liu He, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Ross); in a letter, China Premier Xi noted negotiators have made significant progress, and said each side will redouble efforts to meet each other half way. On the prospects of a deal, Trump flip-flopped, initially saying that there was a very good chance that a deal could be made, then saying &ldquo;who knows whether a deal can be made&rdquo;, then he said it was more likely than not a deal could be reached, and then he added that we may or may not reach a deal with China; For what it is worth, Ross said there is still more to do to reach a deal. It was more straightforward from the Chinese, and Liu He said that from his perspective, a deal was very likely to happen. Mnuchin stated that a deal had been reached on currency manipulation, though didn&rsquo;t provide specifics; earlier in the week it was reported that US demanded China keep the yuan stable (PBOC watchers will be aware that this has been the central bank&rsquo;s policy for some time); USTR Lighthizer said a lot of progress had been made on technology transfers, though also didn&rsquo;t provide details. The upshot is that there was no extension of the &ldquo;hard deadline&rdquo; on 1 March, after which the US will raise tariffs on Chinese goods &ndash; Trump reiterated that this would likely be extended for a short while if progress was being made. In aggregate, there was an abundance of positive adjectives through the press conference, though nothing new was revealed and there was a lack of specifics, seeing some negative ticks in risk assets. Trump confirmed earlier sources reports suggesting he and Premier Xi would meet, perhaps in March at Mar-a-Lago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Bullard (voter, dove) said today that the FOMC would keep rates where they are and see how the economy evolves; adding that he has not pencilled in a rate cut for 2019, whilst reiterating Wednesday&rsquo;s minutes message of seeing QT ending before the end of the year. Further on the balance sheet, Bullard said a shrinking balance sheet only has a minor macroeconomic impact, the effects are only big when rates are near zero; now that rates are higher, changes to the balance sheet will only have a minor impact. Bullard added that he doesn&#39;t want to cut the balance sheet and rates at the same time. Fed&rsquo;s Williams (voter, hawkish) said we must ensure that inflation does not get anchored below target and we must remain vigilant about a possible inflation surge, adds that new inflation dynamics mean the fed can safely &#39;look through&#39; transitory inflation shocks. Fed&#39;s Quarles (voter, neutral) said it is appropriate to keep the balance sheet large enough to buffer against shocks to reserve supply; he favours a return to an all-treasuries balance sheet and that one option of ending the balance sheet run off this year is to hold a fixed level of total assets for a period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADA RETAIL SALES: </strong>Canadian retail sales came in slightly better than expected in, printing -0.1% vs an expected decline of 0.3%; gasoline prices distorted the data, and means that in real terms, retail sales were 0.2% higher. &quot;This report will do little to change the narrative around BoC hikes - we are still tracking Q4 growth at 0.9% (BoC: 1.3%) and the Bank will still need confirmation of a rebound in business investment before moving off the side-lines,&quot; TD Securities said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.30 HIGHER AT USD 57.26/BBL; BRENT (J9) FUTUERS SETTLE USD 0.05 HIGHER AT USD 67.12/BBL. </strong>Oil prices drifted higher on Friday, in line with equities, on improved risk sentiment as the likelihood of a China-US trade deal seems to be insight. &nbsp;It was reported that talks between the two parties were likely to go on past the key March 1st deadline, provided progress is being made, and that Trump and Xi are mulling a meet-up in Mar-A-Lago in late March; all fuelling hopes. WTI saw greater gains than its European counterpart, where analysts at Citi note it &ldquo;may be getting a sentiment lift from having absorbed the 3.7mln bls build in US crude stocks for last week &ndash; including a 3.4mln bls increase at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for the contract &ndash; without wilting.&rdquo; The weekly Baker Hughes Rig Count for the week showed Crude rigs down 4 at 853, gas rigs unchanged at 194 and total rigs down 4 at 1047.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.64% at 2793, NDX +0.79% at 7091, DJI +0.70% at 26032. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.33%, Materials +0.39%, Industrials +0.63%, Cons Discretionary +0.58%, Cons Staples -0.28%, Healthcare +0.93%, Financials -0.23%, Tech +1.29%, Telecoms +1.05%, Utilities +0.60%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Intuit (INTU) surged today after beating top and bottom line estimates as well as raising its EPS guidance. Kraft Heinz (KHC) lost approximately one quarter of its market value after announcing it was being probed by the SEC over its accounting controls, as well as reporting disappointing earnings; other packaged foods names also followed suit such as Campbell Soup (CPB), J. M. Smucker (SJM), General Mills (GIS) and Kellogg (K). Newmont Mining (NEM) caught a bid after Barrick Gold (GOLD) announced plans of an all-stock merger deal. Intel (INTC) opened higher with thanks to an upgrade at Morgan Stanley; Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) rose on the back of this too. Wayfair (W) had its market value increase by approximately one whole third after reporting strong earnings and a growing user base. E-cigarette co. Juul Labs said it expects strong revenue this year causing stake holder Altria (MO) to drift higher on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED +7+ TICKS AT 122-04+.</strong> Yields fell by 2.5-4bps across the curve on Friday. Gains were pressured with newswires attributing selling to optimism over US/China trade talks, which have been extended as policymakers say progress is being made, though failed to provide many specifics. Fed speak tended to focus on broader themes around policy frameworks rather than the current monetary policy/economic outlook; next week&#39;s dual testimony from Fed chair Powell is now eyed for cues about Fed policy. At settlement, major US curve spreads were little changed, with a slightly steeper bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:&nbsp; </strong>A relatively uneventful week for the broad Dollar and index as the latter is poised to conclude the week marginally lower than the open and closer to middle of a 96.290-97.000 weekly range as optimistic US-China trade talks and a net neutral FOMC minutes meant the index struggled to gain firm footing over 97.000. The index kick-started the week around 96.810 and saw volatility amid thinned liquidity conditions as US participants were enjoying a long weekend due to President&rsquo;s Day holidays. The dovish FOMC minutes saw DXY whipsaw and test its 50 DMA around 96.340 to the downside before recovering above the technical level. Furthermore, the release of dismal retail sales the next day saw the index test its 100 DMA at 96.410 to the downside. DXY looks to end Friday&rsquo;s EU trade little changed above 96.500 ahead of President Trumps trade meeting with China&rsquo;s Vice Premier Lui He at 14:30EST, though the dollar is subject to swings from more Fed speakers on the slate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Both poised to end the week on the backfoot with the former recovering after AUD largely shrugged off the release of the RBA minutes and optimistic Australian jobs data and felt a double whammy after Westpac cut its RBA rate forecasts alongside reports of an indefinite ban on Australian coal imports from China. Amid these developments, AUD/USD lost the 0.7100 handle and reached the weekly low of around 0.7070. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied these reports in early EU hours on Friday which helped the AUD crawl off weekly lows, though gains in the Aussie however capped by its Kiwi counterpart after the RBNZ said it could cut rates if the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; banks hike capital ratio to 16% from the current 12%. NZD/USD is poised to end Friday&rsquo;s EU session close to its 50 WMA around 0.6828, whilst highlights for the Kiwi next week include New Zealand&rsquo;s trade balance figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>More angst in the UK as Brexit day approaches and Parliament seems to be split now more than ever. A new Independent Group sprouted from 9 Labour defectors and 3 from the Tory party (now with more seats than the Lib Dems) amidst Brexit dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, Cable is poised to end the week on a firm footing as headlines swayed the Sterling ahead of PM May&rsquo;s progress statement at HoC on the 26th Feb. Speculation still remains on whether a Brexit deal will be voted on next week with the latest from a UK official stating a vote is unlikely. Towards the end of the week, UK press reported that lawmakers could be assembling to take a no-deal off the table, with reports of as many as 25 UK government members ready to vote for an Article 50 extension if PM May does not rule out a no-deal scenario.&nbsp; On a technical front, Cable resides just above its 200 DMA at 1.3000 (after opening at 1.2909 on Monday) and looks set to end the week closer to the middle of a 1.2892-1.3100 weekly range. Similarly, the EUR is set to post a weekly gain, aided by DXY&rsquo;s pullback from 97.000. The release of the ECB minutes provided the currency with little inspiration as the release noted market expectations on rates were in-line with the ECB&rsquo;s guidance, whilst stating that the TLTRO decision should not be taken too hastily. The week also saw the release of flash PMIs for the EZ wherein the manufacturing sector fell to a 69-month low and hence marginally pressured the single currency earlier in the week. Nonetheless, EUR/USD is set to end the week just under 1.1350 vs. an open of around 1.1290.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The Japanese currency was largely tentative during the week as trade talks went underway. USD/JPY traded within a tight 110.44-95 parameter and currently resides between its 50 and 100 DMA at 110.53 and 110.76 ahead of the US President and Chinese Vice-Premiers&rsquo; trade dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> Monday: US Wholesale Inventories.

At the Press conference (with US President Trump, China Vice Premier Liu He, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Ross); in a letter, China Premier Xi noted negotiators have made significant progress, and said each side will redouble efforts to meet each other half way. On the prospects of a deal, Trump flip-flopped, initially saying that there was a very good chance that a deal could be made, then saying &ldquo;who knows whether a deal can be made&rdquo;, then he said it was more likely than not a deal could be reached, and then he added that we may or may not reach a deal with China; For what it is worth, Ross said there is still more to do to reach a deal. It was more straightforward from the Chinese, and Liu He said that from his perspective, a deal was very likely to happen. Mnuchin stated that a deal had been reached on currency manipulation, though didn&rsquo;t provide specifics; earlier in the week it was reported that US demanded China keep the yuan stable (PBOC watchers will be aware that this has been the central bank&rsquo;s policy for some time); USTR Lighthizer said a lot of progress had been made on technology transfers, though also didn&rsquo;t provide details. The upshot is that there was no extension of the &ldquo;hard deadline&rdquo; on 1 March, after which the US will raise tariffs on Chinese goods &ndash; Trump reiterated that this would likely be extended for a short while if progress was being made. In aggregate, there was an abundance of positive adjectives through the press conference, though nothing new was revealed and there was a lack of specifics, seeing some negative ticks in risk assets. Trump confirmed earlier sources reports suggesting he and Premier Xi would meet, perhaps in March at Mar-a-Lago.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: FOMC, ECB, RBA minutes ticked off, next up Trump’s trade talks! ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; A relatively uneventful week for the broad Dollar and index as the latter is poised to conclude the week marginally lower than the open and closer to middle of a 96.290-97.000 weekly range as optimistic US-China trade talks and a net neutral FOMC minutes meant the index struggled to gain firm footing over 97.000. The index kick-started the week around 96.810 and saw volatility amid thinned liquidity conditions as US participants were enjoying a long weekend due to President&rsquo;s Day holidays. The dovish FOMC minutes saw DXY whipsaw and test its 50 DMA around 96.340 to the downside before recovering above the technical level. Furthermore, the release of dismal retail sales the next day saw the index test its 100 DMA at 96.410 to the downside. DXY looks to end Friday&rsquo;s EU trade little changed above 96.500 ahead of President Trumps trade meeting with China&rsquo;s Vice Premier Lui He at 14:30EST, though the dollar is subject to swings from more Fed speakers on the slate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD </strong>&ndash; Both poised to end the week on the backfoot with the former recovering after AUD largely shrugged off the release of the RBA minutes and optimistic Australian jobs data and felt a double whammy after Westpac cut its RBA rate forecasts alongside reports of an indefinite ban on Australian coal imports from China. Amid these developments, AUD/USD lost the 0.7100 handle and reached the weekly low of around 0.7070. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied these reports in early EU hours on Friday which helped the AUD crawl off weekly lows, though gains in the Aussie however capped by its Kiwi counterpart after the RBNZ said it could cut rates if the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; banks hike capital ratio to 16% from the current 12%. NZD/USD is poised to end Friday&rsquo;s EU session close to its 50 WMA around 0.6828, whilst highlights for the Kiwi next week include New Zealand&rsquo;s trade balance figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR </strong>&ndash; More angst in the UK as Brexit day approaches and Parliament seems to be split now more than ever. A new Independent Group sprouted from 9 Labour defectors and 3 from the Tory party (now with more seats than the Lib Dems) amidst Brexit dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, Cable is poised to end the week on a firm footing as headlines swayed the Sterling ahead of PM May&rsquo;s progress statement at HoC on the 26th Feb. Speculation still remains on whether a Brexit deal will be voted on next week with the latest from a UK official stating a vote is unlikely. Towards the end of the week, UK press reported that lawmakers could be assembling to take a no-deal off the table, with reports of as many as 25 UK government members ready to vote for an Article 50 extension if PM May does not rule out a no-deal scenario. &nbsp;On a technical front, Cable resides just above its 200 DMA at 1.3000 (after opening at 1.2909 on Monday) and looks set to end the week closer to the middle of a 1.2892-1.3100 weekly range. Similarly, the EUR is set to post a weekly gain, aided by DXY&rsquo;s pullback from 97.000. The release of the ECB minutes provided the currency with little inspiration as the release noted market expectations on rates were in-line with the ECB&rsquo;s guidance, whilst stating that the TLTRO decision should not be taken too hastily. The week also saw the release of flash PMIs for the EZ wherein the manufacturing sector fell to a 69-month low and hence marginally pressured the single currency earlier in the week. Nonetheless, EUR/USD is set to end the week just under 1.1350 vs. an open of around 1.1290.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; The Japanese currency was largely tentative during the week as trade talks went underway. USD/JPY traded within a tight 110.44-95 parameter and currently resides between its 50 and 100 DMA at 110.53 and 110.76 ahead of the US President and Chinese Vice-Premiers&rsquo; trade dialogue.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were mixed with the Australian benchmark resilient as participants took a breather from the recent deluge of earnings and as financials remained afloat, but with upside capped by weakness in Energy following similar underperformance by the sector stateside and with Woodside Petroleum shares down by over 4% as it traded ex-dividend. Conversely, Japanese stocks were lacklustre after the recent flows into the JPY, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.9%) initially conformed to the indecisive tone but with losses in the mainland eventually reversed after a tepid liquidity injection by the PBoC and as focus remained on US-China trade talks with President Trump set to meet China Vice Premier Liu He later today. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially underpinned by the weak risk sentiment and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for a total JPY 685bln of JGBs, but then pared a majority of the gains after hitting resistance at 153.00 and as the regional stock markets bounced off intraday lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln in 7-day reverse repos for a net weekly injection of CNY 60bln vs. Prev.

(The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Communities and Local Government Percy told the BBC more than 30 MPs may try block a no-deal. (BBC) Furthermore, The Telegraph reported that PM May has been warned by a group of 100 moderate Tory MPs that they are prepared to rebel against the Government to force her to delay Brexit if she cannot reach a deal. (Telegraph) Opposing this, Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have warned they will seek to &ldquo;end the government&rdquo; if PM May delays the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU, as the HoC prepares to vote on proposals to try to avert a no-deal Brexit.

Sectors are mixed, there is some slight outperformance in material names, with the likes of Thyssenkrupp (+2.0%) and Anglo American (+2.7%) in the green. Other notable movers include Wirecard (+3.4%) at the top of the Dax (0.4%) after the Co&rsquo;s CEO stated that business remains strong. Sartorius (-2.3%) are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after being downgraded to sell. Elsewhere, firmly in the green are Telecom Italia (+3.0%) after the Co. reported earnings with revenue broadly in-line with expectations; the Co. have also announced that they are to launch a partnership with Vodafone (+1.2%) to share their 5G mobile network. Nestle (-0.5%), the largest Co. in the Stoxx 600 which has a 3% weighting, in the red due to Kraft-Heinz being down 20% in the pre-market following downbeat earnings, a USD 15.4bln write-down and being subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD,NZD,SEK More volatile trade down under, as the Aussie receives a welcome reprieve from China that has now categorically refuted reports that it blocked coal imports having initially claimed no knowledge rather than issuing a firm denial. However, Aud/Usd still seems top heavy amidst recent more dovish RBA calls, even though the Kiwi has been rattled by similar RBNZ impulses, and from the horse&rsquo;s mouth as it were given comments from Bascand overnight about proposed rises in bank capital requirements heightening easing prospects, in time. Aud/Nzd has rebounded further from sub-1.0400 lows in response, as Nzd/Usd reversed through 0.6800 to circa 0.6760 at one stage. Conversely, Eur/Sek is around 10.6000 in wake of Riksbank minutes and accompanying statements from Governor Ingves in the main, playing down weaker than forecast Swedish inflation in January and keeping guidance for H2 tightening in place, albeit conditional on economic developments and unless downside risks (largely due to external factors) do not materialise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR,GBP The single currency and Sterling remain relatively rangebound on the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles vs the Dollar respectively, but both currencies are getting indirect support from the Greenback&rsquo;s failure to muster/sustain any positive momentum of its own. Eur/Usd continues to hit resistance above 1.1350 and a downbeat German Ifo survey has not helped, while Brexit is a constant weight for the Pound along with related fall-out on the domestic political front. From a tech perspective, 1.3000 is obvious support, especially as the 200 DMA is just 2 pips below, while for Eur/Usd a decent 1.6 bn expiry at the 1.1300 strike may underpin vs a 1.1362 Fib and the 30 DMA in close proximity at 1.1369.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, JPY Not much action in the Loonie or the Japanese currency, though the former is marginally benefiting from gains in the oil complex, mostly driven by market sentiment. Similarly, risk appetite has marginally weakened the JPY, with USD/JPY currently residing just below the top of the 110.65-90 intraday range. Back to the CAD, retail sales may spur some action in the Loonie with the headline expected at -0.3%, up from the prior -0.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10-year Bund futures continue to track higher in European trade. This comes after minimal reaction to more disappointing German data from IFO (business climate 98.5 vs. exp. 99.0), who pointed out that the weak economic phase in German is set to continue; with 10-years also unreactive to the EZ CPI prints which came in essentially in line across the board. The German benchmark is hovering circa session peaks of 166.36 and awaiting further direction from ECB&rsquo;s Draghi and Villeroy who are set to speak later in the day. Debt markets in the UK have also begun the day firmer, with 10-year paper breaking the 124.00 handle to the upside amidst growing suggestions of an extension to Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal date from the EU, and another resignation from the opposition party. In a technical sense, traders are eyeing the 124.29 February 19th high to the upside as the next resistance level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, debt futures are essentially unchanged across the curve after some pressure was offered to US fixed income markets yesterday following a significant slate of investment grade deals (including Boston Scientific&rsquo;s USD 4.3bln issuance) and a block trade of 18k+ THY19 nearer to the close. Traders will now be looking forward to a huge speaker schedule for the day, with 7 Fed speakers on the docket including the increasingly influential voter Bullard who stated that a cut is possible yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices are firmer after a lacklustre overnight session, ahead of US President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at 19:30GMT. Of note Goldman Sachs have revised their 2019 US oil supply growth expectations to 1.4mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Looking ahead, we have the Baker Hughes rig count which last week saw oil rigs increase by 3 to 857, as such the total rig count figure was 1051 from the prior 1049.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) has been largely unchanged taking the lead from an uneventful dollar ahead of multiple key Fed speakers today, including Federal Reserve Vice Chair Clarida at 17:00 GMT. Elsewhere, recent newsflow has seen China&rsquo;s foreign ministry denying reports that some ports in China have halted Australian coal imports; stating that Chinese customs are quality and environmental checks surrounding coal. Barrick Gold is reportedly considering a hostile bid for Newmont Mining Corp, at around USD 19bln in stock; which has the possibility of being one of the largest mining-deals ever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Sectors are mixed, there is some slight outperformance in material names, with the likes of Thyssenkrupp (+2.0%) and Anglo American (+2.7%) in the green. Other notable movers include Wirecard (+3.4%) at the top of the Dax (0.4%) after the Co&rsquo;s CEO stated that business remains strong. Sartorius (-2.3%) are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after being downgraded to sell. Elsewhere, firmly in the green are Telecom Italia (+3.0%) after the Co. reported earnings with revenue broadly in-line with expectations; the Co. have also announced that they are to launch a partnership with Vodafone (+1.2%) to share their 5G mobile network. Nestle (-0.5%), the largest Co. in the Stoxx 600 which has a 3% weighting, in the red due to Kraft-Heinz being down 20% in the pre-market following downbeat earnings, a USD 15.4bln write-down and being subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD,NZD,SEK More volatile trade down under, as the Aussie receives a welcome reprieve from China that has now categorically refuted reports that it blocked coal imports having initially claimed no knowledge rather than issuing a firm denial. However, Aud/Usd still seems top heavy amidst recent more dovish RBA calls, even though the Kiwi has been rattled by similar RBNZ impulses, and from the horse&rsquo;s mouth as it were given comments from Bascand overnight about proposed rises in bank capital requirements heightening easing prospects, in time. Aud/Nzd has rebounded further from sub-1.0400 lows in response, as Nzd/Usd reversed through 0.6800 to circa 0.6760 at one stage. Conversely, Eur/Sek is back below 10.6000 again in wake of Riksbank minutes and accompanying statements from Governor Ingves in the main, playing down weaker than forecast Swedish inflation in January and keeping guidance for H2 tightening in place, albeit conditional on economic developments and unless downside risks (largely due to external factors) do not materialise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR,GBP The single currency and Sterling remain relatively rangebound on the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles vs the Dollar respectively, but both currencies are getting indirect support from the Greenback&rsquo;s failure to muster/sustain any positive momentum of its own. Eur/Usd continues to hit resistance above 1.1350 and a downbeat German Ifo survey has not helped, while Brexit is a constant weight for the Pound along with related fall-out on the domestic political front. From a tech perspective, 1.3000 is obvious support, especially as the 200 DMA is just 2 pips below, while for Eur/Usd a decent 1.6 bn expiry at the 1.1300 strike may underpin vs a 1.1362 Fib and the 30 DMA in close proximity at 1.1369.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, JPY Not much action in the Loonie or the Japanese currency, though the former is marginally benefiting from gains in the oil complex, mostly driven by market sentiment. Similarly, risk appetite has marginally weakened the JPY, with USD/JPY currently residing just below the top of the 110.65-90 intraday range. Back to the CAD, retail sales may spur some action in the Loonie with the headline expected at -0.3%, up from the prior -0.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10-year bund futures continue to track higher in European trade. This comes after minimal reaction to more disappointing German data from IFO (business climate 98.5 vs. exp. 99.0), who pointed out that the weak economic phase in German is set to continue; with 10-years also unreactive to the EZ CPI prints which came in essentially in line across the board. The German benchmark is hovering circa session peaks of 166.36 and awaiting further direction from ECB&rsquo;s Draghi and Villeroy who are set to speak later in the day. Debt markets in the UK have also begun the day firmer, with 10-year paper breaking the 124.00 handle to the upside amidst growing suggestions of an extension to Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal date from the EU, and another resignation from the opposition party. In a technical sense, traders are eyeing the 124.29 February 19th high to the upside as the next resistance level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, debt futures are essentially unchanged across the curve after some pressure was offered to US fixed income markets yesterday following a significant slate of investment grade deals (including Boston Scientific&rsquo;s USD 4.3bln issuance) and a block trade of 18k+ THY19 nearer to the close. Traders will now be looking forward to a huge speaker schedule for the day, with 7 Fed speakers on the docket including the increasingly influential voter Bullard who stated that a cut is possible yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices are firmer after a lacklustre overnight session, ahead of US President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at 19:30GMT. Of note Goldman Sachs have revised their 2019 US oil supply growth expectations to 1.4mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Looking ahead, we have the Baker Hughes rig count which last week saw oil rigs increase by 3 to 857, as such the total rig count figure was 1051 from the prior 1049.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) has been largely unchanged taking the lead from an uneventful dollar ahead of multiple key Fed speakers today, including Federal Reserve Vice Chair Clarida at 17:00 GMT. Elsewhere, recent newsflow has seen China&rsquo;s foreign ministry denying reports that some ports in China have halted Australian coal imports; stating that Chinese customs are quality and environmental checks surrounding coal. Barrick Gold is reportedly considering a hostile bid for Newmont Mining Corp, at around USD 19bln in stock; which has the possibility of being one of the largest mining-deals ever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD,NZD,SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More volatile trade down under, as the Aussie receives a welcome reprieve from China that has now categorically refuted reports that it blocked coal imports having initially claimed no knowledge rather than issuing a firm denial. However, Aud/Usd still seems top heavy amidst recent more dovish RBA calls, even though the Kiwi has been rattled by similar RBNZ impulses, and from the horse&rsquo;s mouth as it were given comments from Bascand overnight about proposed rises in bank capital requirements heightening easing prospects, in time. Aud/Nzd has rebounded further from sub-1.0400 lows in response, as Nzd/Usd reversed through 0.6800 to circa 0.6760 at one stage. Conversely, Eur/Sek is back below 10.6000 again in wake of Riksbank minutes and accompanying statements from Governor Ingves in the main, playing down weaker than forecast Swedish inflation in January and keeping guidance for H2 tightening in place, albeit conditional on economic developments and unless downside risks (largely due to external factors) do not materialise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR,GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency and Sterling remain relatively rangebound on the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles vs the Dollar respectively, but both currencies are getting indirect support from the Greenback&rsquo;s failure to muster/sustain any positive momentum of its own. Eur/Usd continues to hit resistance above 1.1350 and a downbeat German Ifo survey has not helped, while Brexit is a constant weight for the Pound along with related fall-out on the domestic political front. From a tech perspective, 1.3000 is obvious support, especially as the 200 DMA is just 2 pips below, while for Eur/Usd a decent 1.6 bn expiry at the 1.1300 strike may underpin vs a 1.1362 Fib and the 30 DMA in close proximity at 1.1369.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD, JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much action in the Loonie or the Japanese currency, though the former is marginally benefiting from gains in the oil complex, mostly driven by market sentiment. Similarly, risk appetite has marginally weakened the JPY, with USD/JPY currently residing just below the top of the 110.65-90 intraday range. Back to the CAD, retail sales may spur some action in the Loonie with the headline expected at -0.3%, up from the prior -0.9%.</p>\r\n",

Bunds opened at 166.17 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 166.07 close and dipped to 166.11 at one stage before regaining momentum with the aid of EU participants returning to the fore, but have now faded from a recovery high of 166.32. Looking ahead, the Ifo survey looks instrumental ahead of Eurozone inflation data and perhaps more importantly speeches from ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy and President Draghi this afternoon.</p>\r\n",

(Telegraph) Opposing this, Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have warned they will seek to &ldquo;end the government&rdquo; if PM May delays the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU, as the HoC prepares to vote on proposals to try to avert a no-deal Brexit.

(Handelsblatt)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action was mostly uneventful amid a lack of currency moving data releases which saw the greenback stabilize from the prior day&rsquo;s whipsaw, while its major counterparts were also steady with EUR/USD and GBP/USD virtually unchanged at the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles respectively. Elsewhere, a subdued risk tone thwarted recovery attempts by JPY-crosses and kept USD/JPY relatively flat in the aftermath of an uneventful Japanese CPI release, while antipodeans languished near this week&rsquo;s lows for most the session before NZD/USD slipped heavily below 0.6800 after the RBNZ suggested its proposed bank capital increase could lead to an eventual rate cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ said the capital hike proposal would give big 4 banks 5 years to increase capital ratio to 16% from current 12% and that the bank capital increase could lead to an eventual rate cut.

The European day lent further selling bias with traders optimistic that a no deal Brexit can be avoided. Once again, a corporate supply slate added some selling pressure, with some chunky investment grade deals launching on Thursday. The European close saw some profit taking, into the 30-year TIPS auction, which stopped through and saw better cover. The steepening continued into the close, with major curve spreads steepening.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were mixed with the Australian benchmark resilient as participants took a breather from the recent deluge of earnings and as financials remained afloat, but with upside capped by weakness in Energy following similar underperformance by the sector stateside and with Woodside Petroleum shares down by over 4% as it traded ex-dividend. Conversely, Japanese stocks were lacklustre after the recent flows into the JPY, while Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) conformed to the indecisive tone but with losses in the mainland eventually reversed after a tepid liquidity injection by the PBoC and as focus remained on US-China trade talks with President Trump set to meet China Vice Premier Liu He later today. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially underpinned by the weak risk sentiment and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for a total JPY 685bln of JGBs, but then pared a majority of the gains after hitting resistance at 153.00 and as the regional stock markets bounced off intraday lows.</p>\r\n",
