Pfizer (PFE) closed lower after the co. posted mixed earnings and guided lower, as well as M&amp;A talk with Mylan N.V. (MYL), who shot higher on the news that it would merge with Upjohn, Pfizer’s off-patent drug business. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC) fell after the co. posted earnings that beat on the top but missed on the bottom lines. Disney (DIS) was well supported as its live-action remake of The Lion King continued to break box office records. Boeing (BA) was under pressure following BBC reports that work on the 737 MAX production line was not sufficiently funded. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) both moved lower, with the news that US President Trump wants to \"scuttle\" the USD 10bln Pentagon cloud contract that both tech co.’s are currently fighting for doing little to help. Apple (AAPL) advanced on positive news flow regarding the co.’s plans to use newly acquired Intel assets to produce its own modem before 2021 and on a price target raise at UBS. Lyft (LYFT) sunk on reports that COO McNiell, a former Tesla employee, is to leave the company. Grubhub (GRUB) closed higher after Just Eat (JE LN) agreed a GBP 9bln merger with Takeaway.com, lowering the overall number of market participants in the food delivery sector. Notable stocks moving higher after positive broker moves; Gilead Sciences (GILD) upgraded at RBC Capital, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) upgraded at Evercore ISI, AB InBev (BUD) upgraded at BAML, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) upgraded at Goldman Sachs.

S&amp;P 500 -0.2% AT 3021, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% AT 7989, DJIA 0.1% AT 27221.</p><p>Treasuries moved higher to start the week, taking their cues from falling global yields and in anticipation of a Fed rate cut on Wednesday, in addition to the uncertainty from US-China trade talks in the next few days. No-deal Brexit fears surged as UK PM Johnson doubled down on the threat of a no-deal, just another global risk adding credence to central bank easing. US investors are also likely to be concerned by the evident slowdown in global manufacturing, which seeped into Friday’s US Q2 GDP data, despite the consumer segment remaining robust. At settlement the curve had flattened modestly (2s10s approximately 1bps narrower), with yields down between 1.5bps and 2.5bps. Elsewhere, US treasury said it borrowed (USD) 40bln in Q2 and that it expects to issue 433bln worth of debt in Q3 (higher than the prior 160bln estimate) and 381bln in Q4 of this year. US T-note futures (U9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 127-14+.</p>",

Treasuries and gold were bid ahead of risk events this week, such as the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and the initiation of US-China trade talks, where tentative participants were likely holding back from risk assets. The dollar was little changed on the day, with EurUsd trading tight, but Cable made fresh multi-year lows as UK PM Johnson wiped clean any doubts about his Brexit hard-line stance which had bolstered him to power.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Friday AMC US President Trump said he believes China will want to wait until the 2020 election to get a trade deal secured, therefore any updates from both sides regarding a time frame will be of note. Ahead of the US &amp; China trade talks tomorrow, Xinhua reported China saying that “sincerity” is still key in the new round of talks, reiterating the need for both sides to meet halfway, and added that getting a good restart will not be easy. On the Japanese/South Korea front Sankei reported Japanese PM Abe is to forgo talks with his South Korean counterpart Moon at the UN in September. However, Yonhap reported that talks could come as soon as this week, according to sources.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson will not meet with any EU leaders until they agree to remove backstop, the Telegraph reported. An Official Spokesman said while Mr Johnson does want to meet EU leaders and negotiate, he will not want to \"sit down and be told that the EU cannot possibly reopen the Withdrawal Agreement\". Earlier in the day, Johnson had called for a brand-new free trade deal with EU, saying that there is every chance the UK can get a deal. He then reiterated that \"we will come out with a deal or no deal on October 31st\". An upping of the stakes on Monday by Johnson followed news over the weekend<strong>, </strong>that he had set-up a ‘war cabinet’ of six Brexit supporting minsters, who are said to be working on leaving the EU on 31-Oct ‘by all means necessary’. RBC note that this is likely to rekindle the idea of preventing parliament from sitting. Also over the weekend; UK Chancellor Javid said that ‘all necessary funding will be made available’ to prepare for a no deal exit which is now, according to the man in charge of no deal preparations, Michael Gove, the base case scenario for the government. In terms of polling, the latest weekend polls show what the media is calling a ‘Boris bounce’: Conservative support has increased by 7 points to 30%, just ahead of Labour at 28%, with the poll suggesting that the Conservative gain came at the expense the Brexit party.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 127-14+:</strong> Treasuries moved higher to start the week, taking their cues from falling global yields and in anticipation of a Fed rate cut on Wednesday, in addition to the uncertainty from US-China trade talks in the next few days. No-deal Brexit fears surged as UK PM Johnson doubled down on the threat of a no-deal, just another global risk adding credence to central bank easing. US investors are also likely to be concerned by the evident slowdown in global manufacturing, which seeped into Friday’s US Q2 GDP data, despite the consumer segment remaining robust. At settlement the curve had flattened modestly (2s10s approximately 1bps narrower), with yields down between 1.5bps and 2.5bps. Elsewhere, US treasury said it borrowed (USD) 40bln in Q2 and that it expects to issue 433bln worth of debt in Q3 (higher than the prior 160bln estimate) and 381bln in Q4 of this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.67 HIGHER AT USD 56.87/BBL; BRENT (U9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.25 HIGHER AT USD 63.71/BBL: </strong>Prices ended firmer on Monday following some choppy trade in the earlier session. UK Foreign Minister Raab declaring that the UK would not consider a tanker swap with Iran, in addition to Iran restarting production at its Arak heavy-water reactor, both failed to provide support to the energy complex in the Asian/European session. However, prices rose gradually from the EU equity close through till US energy settlement, finding some support from rising equity indices and perhaps a reassessment of geopolitical risk, where US Secretary of State Pompeo expressed renewed concern about Iran’s nuclear pursuit and also comments from the Iranian VP urging China and other Iran-friendly nations to buy more of its crude. Elsewhere, oil demand remains an overhanging concern. US Q2 GDP data on Friday showed the first fall in business investment since 2015, echoing the global manufacturing slump. Additionally, participants will be paying close attention to the outcome of US-China trade talks in the coming days where a breakdown risks impeding Chinese oil demand (the world’s second largest oil consumer behind the US); UBS’ Daniel Ellis believes the outcome of the talks are crucial for the near-term outlook in crude.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.2% AT 3021, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% AT 7989, DOW JONES 0.1% AT 27221, S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.6%, Consumer Staples 0.3%, Energy -0.3%, Financials -0.8%, Health Care 0.4%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology -0.1%, Materials -0.3%, Telecommunication Services -0.5%, Utilities 0.5%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong>&nbsp;Pfizer (PFE) closed lower after the co. posted mixed earnings and guided lower, as well as M&amp;A talk with Mylan N.V. (MYL), who shot higher on the news that it would merge with Upjohn, Pfizer’s off-patent drug business. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC) fell after the co. posted earnings that beat on the top but missed on the bottom lines. Disney (DIS) was well supported as its live-action remake of The Lion King continued to break box office records. Boeing (BA) was under pressure following BBC reports that work on the 737 MAX production line was not sufficiently funded. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) both moved lower, with the news that US President Trump wants to \"scuttle\" the USD 10bln Pentagon cloud contract that both tech co.’s are currently fighting for doing little to help. Apple (AAPL) advanced on positive news flow regarding the co.’s plans to use newly acquired Intel assets to produce its own modem before 2021 and on a price target raise at UBS. Lyft (LYFT) sunk on reports that COO McNiell, a former Tesla employee, is to leave the company. Grubhub (GRUB) closed higher after Just Eat (JE LN) agreed a GBP 9bln merger with Takeaway.com, lowering the overall number of market participants in the food delivery sector. Notable stocks moving higher after positive broker moves; Gilead Sciences (GILD) upgraded at RBC Capital, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) upgraded at Evercore ISI, AB InBev (BUD) upgraded at BAML, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) upgraded at Goldman Sachs. Notable stocks under pressure after negative broker moves; Starbucks (SBUX) downgraded at JP Morgan, Dish Networks (DISH), Dow Inc (DOW) downgraded at Citi and Susquehanna, PayPal (PYPL) downgraded at Guggenheim, American Airlines (AAL) downgraded at Macquarie, TripAdvisor (TRIP) downgraded at Vertical Group.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:GBP</strong> was the standout underperformer; cable saw fresh 2-year lows as no deal Brexit fears intensified, with the downside likely compounded by a running of stops/technical selling. Cable now appears to have a clean run until support at 1.2160 (March 2017 low) and the key psychological 1.20 level (also the Jan 2017 low). The rest of G10 FX was comparatively benign; <strong>EUR</strong> firmer and <strong>USD</strong> flat, albeit trading within thin ranges ahead of key risk events later in the week; with EURUSD finding a floor just above last Friday’s 1.1112 low before consolidating around 1.1140. The <strong>antipodeans</strong> were equally subdued, if not a tad weaker on the firmer buck, whilst <strong>CAD</strong> took its cues from the crude complex. Safe havens were mixed; <strong>JPY </strong>was firm overnight (amid reports Japan’s GPIF began hedging overseas bond investments in a move which sources noted could spur other funds to follow suit) but pared gains to finish; USDJPY moving back above last Friday’s highs as the greenback strengthened. Conversely, <strong>CHF</strong> was a touch firmer. <strong>EMFX</strong> was a touch weaker as the dollar advanced, with the notable exceptions of <strong>TRY</strong> and <strong>ZAR</strong>; the former continuing to gain in wake of last week’s CBRT meeting (in which policy makers cut rates by a greater than expected 425bps, but indicated policy normalisation going forward) and the latter retracing some last week’s steep losses post Moody's 'credit negative' assessment of the Eskom bailout. <strong>BRL</strong> was uninspired, as participants eye Wednesday’s BCB meeting (25bps cut expected) and the pension reform process remains on ice due to parliamentary recess.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling sunk on Monday, as UK PM Johnson continued to strike a hard-line with the EU. Ahead of his election, some had perceived Johnson's comments to be pre-election bluster. However, since his appointment as PM, Johnson has remained defiant in his stance, which is also evident in the appointments he made to the Cabinet. If Johnson is serious about leaving with or without a deal on October 31st then markets will need to increasingly price out the possibility of an A50 extension and most likely an early snap general election. The issue in trying to get a deal other than the stalemate between the UK and EU is the Parliamentary arithmetic which remains a headache for the PM, particularly given opposition from within his own party who have raised the possibility of voting the government down in the event of a no deal Brexit. As such, a no deal outcome is becoming increasingly likely, with this perception boosted by recent UK press coverage which has centred around the ramp-up in no deal Brexit preparation by the UK government. However, adding to recent downside is the departure of the BoE (which is expected to stand pat on rates this Thursday) from a mildly hawkish to a neutral/dovish bias on interest rates, SocGen notes. “Though wage growth has accelerated nicely to 3.6%, one or more members could advocate lower rates to shadow US and ECB policy, and fears that the rhetoric of a no deal Brexit is sapping business confidence” the bank says. The danger for cable, SocGen concludes, remains to the downside and an acceleration towards 1.20.</p>",

US investors are also likely to be concerned by the evident slowdown in global manufacturing, which seeped into Friday’s US Q2 GDP data, despite the consumer segment remaining robust. At settlement the curve had flattened modestly (2s10s approximately 1bps narrower), with yields down between 1.5bps and 2.5bps. Elsewhere, US treasury said it borrowed (USD) 40bln in Q2 and that it expects to issue 433bln worth of debt in Q3 (higher than the prior 160bln estimate) and 381bln in Q4 of this year.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>* GBP was the standout underperformer; cable saw fresh 2-year lows as no deal Brexit fears intensified, with the downside likely compounded by a running of stops/technical selling. Cable now appears to have a clean run until support at 1.2160 (March 2017 low) and the key psychological 1.20 level (also the Jan 2017 low). The rest of G10 FX was comparatively benign; EUR and USD were somewhat firmer, albeit trading within thin ranges ahead of key risk events later in the week; indeed EURUSD finding a floor just above last Friday’s 1.1112 low before consolidating around 1.1140. The antipodeans were equally subdued, if not a tad weaker on the firmer buck, whilst CAD took its cues from the crude complex. Safe havens were mixed; JPY was firm overnight (amid reports Japan’s GPIF began hedging overseas bond investments in a move which sources noted could spur other funds to follow suit) but pared gains to finish; USDJPY moving back above last Friday’s highs as the greenback strengthened. Conversely, CHF was a touch firmer. EMFX was a touch weaker as the dollar advanced, with the notable exceptions of TRY and ZAR; the former continuing to gain in wake of last week’s CBRT meeting (in which policy makers cut rates by a greater than expected 425bps, but indicated policy normalisation going forward) and the latter retracing some last week’s steep losses post Moody's 'credit negative' assessment of the Eskom bailout. BRL was uninspired, as participants eye Wednesday’s BCB meeting (25bps cut expected) and the pension reform process remains on ice due to parliamentary recess.</p><p>* GBP: Sterling sunk on Monday, as UK PM Johnson continued to strike a hard-line with the EU. Ahead of his election, some had perceived Johnson's comments to be pre-election bluster. However, since his appointment as PM, Johnson has remained defiant in his stance, which is also evident in the appointments he made to the Cabinet. If Johnson is serious about leaving with or without a deal on October 31st then markets will need to increasingly price out the possibility of an A50 extension and most likely an early snap general election. The issue in trying to get a deal other than the stalemate between the UK and EU is the Parliamentary arithmetic which remains a headache for the PM, particularly given opposition from within his own party who have raised the possibility of voting the government down in the event of a no deal Brexit. As such, a no deal outcome is becoming increasingly likely, with this perception boosted by recent UK press coverage which has centred around the ramp-up in no deal Brexit preparation by the UK government. However, adding to recent downside is the departure of the BoE (which is expected to stand pat on rates this Thursday) from a mildly hawkish to a neutral/dovish bias on interest rates, SocGen notes. “Though wage growth has accelerated nicely to 3.6%, one or more members could advocate lower rates to shadow US and ECB policy, and fears that the rhetoric of a no deal Brexit is sapping business confidence” the bank says. The danger for cable, SocGen concludes, remains to the downside and an acceleration towards 1.20.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

UK Foreign Minister Raab declaring that the UK would not consider a tanker swap with Iran, in addition to Iran restarting production at its Arak heavy-water reactor, both failed to provide support to the energy complex in the Asian/European session. However, prices rose gradually from the EU equity close through till US energy settlement, finding some support from rising equity indices and perhaps a reassessment of geopolitical risk, where US Secretary of State Pompeo expressed renewed concern about Iran’s nuclear pursuit and also comments from the Iranian VP urging China and other Iran-friendly nations to buy more of its crude. Elsewhere, oil demand remains an overhanging concern. US Q2 GDP data on Friday showed the first fall in business investment since 2015, echoing the global manufacturing slump. Additionally, participants will be paying close attention to the outcome of US-China trade talks in the coming days where a breakdown risks impeding Chinese oil demand (the world’s second largest oil consumer behind the US); UBS’ Daniel Ellis believes the outcome of the talks are crucial for the near-term outlook in crude.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Pound plummets as no-deal fears materialise",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The standout G10 underperformer as concerns over a disorderly Brexit snowballs, with weekend press noting that the UK government is intensifying funding for a no-deal Brexit, later followed by comments UK Foreign Secretary Raab and PM Johnson in which the former reaffirmed hard-lines in negotiations and the latter reiterated that the UK will come out of the EU on October 31st ,“deal or no deal”. Cable has retreated further from the 1.2350 mark and is poised to end the EU session sub-1.2300, having opened around 1.2375. For the technicians, not much to report on the support-front apart from the psychological round/half round numbers ahead of long-term supports at 1.2200 and then 1.2000.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index continued to nudge higher, largely due to influence from the Brexit-battered Sterling mentioned above. DXY has extended gains above the 98.00 and surpassed last week’s highs (98.09) having traded in a 97.90-98.16 intraday range, with the next level to the upside at 98.37, the YTD high. However, further jawboning from US President Trump did prompt the DXY to come off highs as the US leader stated that “a small rate cut is not enough” ahead of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Looking ahead to tomorrow, US-China trade talks in Shanghai will draw the most attention, albeit expectations for a breakthrough has been played down by many US officials, instead markets will gauge the results of the talks by the timeframe between future meetings, if any.</p><p><strong>EUR, AUD, NZD, JPY</strong></p><p>All absorbing the impact of a firmer Dollar to an extent, but for different reasons. The single currency is cushioned via the EUR/GBP cross, which has extended gains above 0.9000 to a high of 0.9085 (vs. an open at 0.8990), thus EUR/USD is poised to end the European session little changed and in the middle of a 1.1113-40 parameter. Elsewhere, the antipodeans are eyeing the US-Sino discussions with AUD/USD hardly changed on the day and within a narrow 17 pip intraday range. Meanwhile, NZD/USD remains closer to the middle of a 0.6620-40 range having earlier tested its 50 DMA (0.6621) to the downside. Finally, an overall uneventful day for the JPY after initial overnight strength (amid reports Japan’s GPIF began hedging overseas bond investments in a move which sources noted could spur other funds to follow suit) waned shortly after with USD/JPY now back at pre-sources levels (having traded in a 108.42-70 intraday range) ahead of tonight’s BoJ’s monetary policy decision (full preview available in the Research Suite).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira has continued to strengthen in the aftermath of the CBRT’s deeper-than-forecast rate cut as the prospect of a normalising economy seemingly materialises. Analysts at SocGen also speculate that yield-seekers may be bypassing G10 currencies and instead chasing EM yields. USD/TRY is poised to end the session closer to the bottom of a 5.6050-6710 parameter</p>",

Ahead of his election, some had perceived Johnson's comments to be pre-election bluster. However, since his appointment as PM, Johnson has remain defiant in his stance and this can also be seen by the appointments he has made to his cabinet. If Johnson is serious about leaving with or without a deal on October 31st then markets will need to increasingly price out the possibility of an A50 extension and most likely an early snap general election. The issue in trying to get a deal other than the stalemate between the UK and EU is the Parliamentary arithmetic which remains a headache for the PM, particularly given opposition from within his own party who have raised the possibility of voting the government down in the event of a no deal Brexit. As such, a no deal outcome is becoming increasingly likely, with this perception also boosted by recent UK press coverage which has centered around the ramp-up in no deal Brexit preparation by the UK government.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were subdued by the risk averse tone and amid reports Japan’s GPIF began hedging overseas bond investments in a move which sources noted could spur other funds to follow suit and weigh on <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong>, while antipodeans were lacklustre due to the tentative risk tone with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> testing support at the 0.6900 level to the downside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>South African President Ramaphosa must place strict limits on a plan to seize land without payment under policies to speed up transfers to the country’s black majority, a panel advising the South African president has said. (FT)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities began the week uneventful with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures flat as early mild pressure was nullified by support at the USD 56.00/bbl and amid a lack of bearish catalysts for the energy complex with the latest Baker Hughes rig count showing a drop in oil and gas rigs, while the emergency meeting between Iran and world leaders was said to have been constructive although unresolved issues remain and Iran reiterated it will keep paring back its nuclear commitments. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were kept rangebound as markets await this week’s FOMC in which the Fed are expected to cut rates for the 1st time in over a decade, and <strong>copper</strong> prices also languished amid the lack of risk appetite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Baker Hughes (July 26) showed oil rigs -3 at 776, gas rigs -5 at 169, total rigs -8 at 946.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>US President Trump said he is not upset at North Korea's recent missile launches and does not blame Turkey for buying the S-400.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The T-plex traded sideways and a little choppy to end the week, seemingly unphased by the GDP data or by Trump dismissing the use of dollar intervention. The US Q2 GDP saw very mild selling 2.1% (exp. 1.8%), but analysts note algos, CTAs, and real money bought the dip. NEC Director Kudlow announcing Trump’s opposition to dollar intervention kept Treasuries supported. At settlement the curve was little changed. US T-note futures (U9) settled 2 ticks lower at 127-07.</p><p>US Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Trump administration to permit it to shift military funds to use to construct the border wall.
