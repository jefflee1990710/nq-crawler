Lululemon (LULU) opened higher after reporting a beat on top and bottom line estimates. T-Mobile US (TMUS) was under pressure on the news that the telecoms co.’s proposed merger with Sprint (S) could face additions delays and legal hurdles. Disney (DIS) caught a bid after Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the co. on optimism for its streaming service. Twitter (TWTR) sunk after Moffett Nathanson cut its profit target for the social media platform to the second lowest on the Street. Tyson Foods (TSN) opened higher after overnight reports that the food maker was poised to enter the plant-based meat market, rivalling incumbents such as Beyond Meat (BYND), who sunk on the news. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) was under pressure after executives said that “there has been a little bit of softness in the US market”. Lockheed Martin (LMT) opened solidly in the green, after it said that it was a year ahead of its goal of cutting the cost of the F-35 to USD 80mln per jet. Target (TGT) opened higher, after the co. announced in a blog post that its same-day delivery is now available through its website, but eventually gave away most of these gains. Lennar Corp (LEN) was buoyed after receiving an upgrade to outperform at Wedbush. Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) moved higher after Evercore initiated both with an 'outperform'.

The US Treasury auctioned 30-year debt, stopping through the screens by 0.4bps, while cover rose vs recent averages and the prior auction; the foreign bid remained (as was seen in all auctions this week), with indirect participation remaining above the previous auction as well as recent averages. Friday’s retail sales data is the final piece of the data puzzle ahead of next week’s FOMC meeting; markets are pricing a 28% chance of a rate cut at the June meeting (which comes ahead of the G20 on 28-29th June, which will set the tone for trade wars, and global growth expectations); accordingly there is more aggressive pricing for a July rate cut, which is now over 100% implied, according to money markets, suggesting that the market is increasingly pricing in the possibility of a 50bps rate cut, instead of the ‘usual’ 25bps. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with 2s30s steepening by 3.5bps. US T-note futures (M9) 11+ ticks higher at 127-00.</p>",

US President Trump feels that it is too soon to even think about making a deal with Iran, adding that both sides were not yet ready. A White House official said that the US is discussing options with allies on the protection of international shipping to the Gulf; adding that the US wants to ensure freedom of navigation, and that international commerce is not disrupted, believing that more attacks could follow. As the case for ratcheting up pressure on Iran is being made, it is worth highlighting that on Wednesday Iran said it would not attack anyone, but if it was attacked, it would defend itself. The incident came around a month after previous attacks in the region, with countries including the US and Saudi claiming Iran was behind those too.</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>A<strong> </strong>White House spokesperson, when asked if US President Trump will meet Chinese President Xi at the G20 Summit, said \"it looks like we're moving that way\". NEC Director Kudlow later echoed this by saying that the US intends to have a Trump-Xi meeting at the G20, but it had not yet been formalised.</p><p><strong>* RUSSIA: </strong>Following Trump’s suggestion that he was mulling sanctions on the Nord Stream 2, Russian President Putin said that tensions with the US were worsening. This comes alongside Trump announcing that the US and Poland would be sending troops to Poland, in a deterrence measure against Russia. A Russian Lawmaker also said that US plans to deploy spy drones in Poland is of concern to Moscow, stating that Poland could be targeted in a retaliatory strike in the scenario of an attack on Russia.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The first ballot vote on PM May’s successor saw Boris Johnson finish well ahead of the pack, securing 114 votes, where Jeremy Hunt came second with 43; Andrea Leadsom, Mark Haper, and Esther McVay were eliminated leaving seven candidates to take part in the second vote on Tuesday, 18th June. The pound saw brief downside as Johnson garnered more support than anticipate, and as such, keeps the threat of a no-deal Brexit alive.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>When asked if Italy will finance planned tax cuts through deficit, Italian Deputy PM Di Maio said Italy \"will do what Italians need\". EU finance ministers took a firm line: EU’s Moscovici commented that he needs new data and a clear path from Italy that shows it complies with fiscal rules in 2019 and 2020 if they are to avert disciplinary procedures. Also, EU’s Dombrovskis said that Italy needs to adopt substantial fiscal corrections to meet EU targets.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Villeroy (Dovish) said that monetary policy must be kept accommodative as long as the Eurozone is not at its inflation target, adding that the ECB can do more if the current downturn worsens.</p><p><strong>* SNB REVIEW: </strong>As expected, the SNB left rates unchanged at -0.75%. The Bank did not change policy towards or the language surrounding FX, reiterating that the situation in FX market is still fragile, maintaining that expansionary monetary policy and intervention are essential. However, it noted that the CHF is stronger than it was in March; notably, this is not a change in the language surrounding FX as some had been expecting the assessment around the CHF’s value to be upgraded to ‘significantly overvalued’.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) SETTLES USD 1.14 HIGHER AT 52.28/BBL; BRENT (Q9) SETTLES USD 1.34 HIGHER AT USD 61.31/BBL:</strong> Energy markets have spiked on Thursday with thanks to the escalation of geopolitical tensions, however, some of the move pared back throughout the day. Prices surged on the announcement of the tanker attacks. The most immediate threat to the global supply chain would be the halting of shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, which sees approximately 40% of annual seaborne crude flow and is effectively controlled by Iran; if it were to shut, this could lead to military escalation amongst Iran and other local nations putting a lot more crude supply at risk. Later, Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih said KSA is committed to providing guaranteed oil supplies to international markets, and added that energy giant Saudi Aramco has increased readiness to deal with attacks.</p><p><strong>* OPEC REPORT:</strong> OPEC released its monthly report, and in fitting with the recent narrative of slowing global growth, cut its 2019 global oil demand forecast to 1.14mln BPD, down 70,000 BPD from previously. On the supply side, it was reported that production fell 236k BPD in May to 29.88mln BPD. Comparing this to the EIA STEO on Tuesday, OPEC’s oil demand downgrade is smaller than the EIA’s 160k BPD cut, however the EIA sees higher total global demand growth at 1.22mln BPD. IEA is next to report on Friday.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 127-00: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-steepened after geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while traders also cited increasing expectations of Fed rate cuts also pushing shorter-dated yields lower. 2-year yields came in by over 6bps, while longer-dated yields were around 2.5bps lower. The US Treasury auctioned 30-year debt, stopping through the screens by 0.4bps, while cover rose vs recent averages and the prior auction; the foreign bid remained (as was seen in all auctions this week), with indirect participation remaining above the previous auction as well as recent averages. Friday’s retail sales data is the final piece of the data puzzle ahead of next week’s FOMC meeting; markets are pricing a 28% chance of a rate cut at the June meeting (which comes ahead of the G20 on 28-29th June, which will set the tone for trade wars, and global growth expectations); accordingly there is more aggressive pricing for a July rate cut, which is now over 100% implied, according to money markets, suggesting that the market is increasingly pricing in the possibility of a 50bps rate cut, instead of the ‘usual’ 25bps. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with 2s30s steepening by 3.5bps.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 2892, NASDAQ-100 0.5% at 7511, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.4% at 26107; SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.9%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.1%, Energy&nbsp; 1.3%, Financials&nbsp; 0.2%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.1%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.5%, Information Technology&nbsp; 0.2%, Materials&nbsp; 0.6%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The energy sector outperformed following the rally in crude. Lululemon (LULU) opened higher after reporting a beat on top and bottom line estimates. T-Mobile US (TMUS) was under pressure on the news that the telecoms co.’s proposed merger with Sprint (S) could face additions delays and legal hurdles. Disney (DIS) <i>caught a bid</i> after Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the co. on optimism for its streaming service. Twitter (TWTR) sunk after Moffett Nathanson cut its profit target for the social media platform to the second lowest on the Street. Tyson Foods (TSN) opened higher after overnight reports that the food maker was poised to enter the plant-based meat market, rivalling incumbents such as Beyond Meat (BYND), who sunk on the news. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) was under pressure after executives said that “there has been a little bit of softness in the US market”. Lockheed Martin (LMT) opened solidly in the green, after it said that it was a year ahead of its goal of cutting the cost of the F-35 to USD 80mln per jet. Target (TGT) opened higher, after the co. announced in a blog post that its same-day delivery is now available through its website, but eventually gave away most of these gains. Lennar Corp (LEN) was buoyed after receiving an upgrade to outperform at Wedbush. Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) moved higher after Evercore initiated both with an 'outperform'.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Havens are bid amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. However, <strong>JPY</strong> remains in the middle of its 108.00-108.50 range, <strong>XAU</strong> is towards the top end of its recent c.1325-1350 range, while the <strong>CHF</strong> is also higher, given support from the SNB rate decision. The <strong>DXY </strong>has been meandering, but is around neutral heading into the APAC session; in early trade, the USD was dictating the tone, and even small moves were reverberating more widely in other FX. <strong>GBP</strong> has not reclaimed 1.27, and saw brief downside after Brexiteer and frontrunner Boris Johnson emerged with larger than expected support from the first leadership ballot; 1.2670 has been decent support on Thursday. <strong>CAD</strong> is higher, tracking oil prices, although <strong>NOK</strong> could not muster gains against the EUR nor the USD. <strong>AUD</strong> is lower after the jobs report; analysts said that, despite a better headline, the data still bolsters the case for RBA rate cuts, although the timing is uncertain. <strong>TRY</strong> is bucking the EMFX trend, after higher oil prices, tensions over the S-400 missile system and weak data put pressure on the Lira. <strong>RUB</strong> also trades lower, with Trump’s mulling of sanctions on Nord Stream 2 pipeline getting wider airing. <strong>BRL</strong> is firmed after optimism over pension reform, where policymakers see savings above what has been recently expected.</p>",

The US Treasury auctioned 30-year debt, stopping through the screens by 0.4bps, while cover rose vs recent averages and the prior auction; the foreign bid remained (as was seen in all auctions this week), with indirect participation remaining above the previous auction as well as recent averages. Friday’s retail sales data is the final piece of the data puzzle ahead of next week’s FOMC meeting; markets are pricing a 28% chance of a rate cut at the June meeting (which comes ahead of the G20 on 28-29th June, which will set the tone for trade wars, and global growth expectations); accordingly there is more aggressive pricing for a July rate cut, which is now over 100% implied, according to money markets, suggesting that the market is increasingly pricing in the possibility of a 50bps rate cut, instead of the ‘usual’ 25bps. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with 2s30s steepening by 3.5bps.</p>",

Prices surged on the announcement of the tanker attacks. The most immediate threat to the global supply chain would be the halting of shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, which sees approximately 40% of annual seaborne crude flow and is effectively controlled by Iran; if it were to shut, this could lead to military escalation amongst Iran and other local nations putting a lot more crude supply at risk.</li><li><strong>OPEC REPORT:</strong> OPEC released its monthly report, and in fitting with the recent narrative of slowing global growth, cut its 2019 global oil demand forecast to 1.14mln BPD, down 70,000 BPD from previously. On the supply side, it was reported that production fell 236k BPD in May to 29.88mln BPD. Comparing this to the EIA STEO on Tuesday, OPEC’s oil demand downgrade is smaller than the EIA’s 160k BPD cut, however the EIA sees higher total global demand growth at 1.22mln BPD. IEA is next to report on Friday.</li></ul>",

With USD 24bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the supply will raise a net USD 54bln of new cash. TD Securities points out that the Fed’s portfolio run-ff has slowed to USD 15bln in Treasuries, versus USD 30bln previous, however, with no SOMA maturities in the mid-month, the Fed is set to conduct its add-ons later in the month.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>Recent auctions in the 30-year sector have tailed. However, TD Securities suggests that curve steepening might provide demand for long-end debt.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>has now eclipsed 97.000 as the Greenback continues to rebound from recent lows, with the index probing above bullish technical levels at 97.020 and 97.033 (100 and 200 DMAs respectively) on its way to 97.086. The rationale, heightened US-global trade tensions and geopolitical factors prompting a broad downturn in risk sentiment to the benefit of the Buck and other safe-havens like Bullion, the Franc and Yen to varying degrees.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>As noted, the Franc is among the outperformers and most sought after currencies, as Usd/Chf trades mostly below 0.9950 and Eur/Chf hovers around 1.1200, largely shrugging off latest SNB policy guidance that it is ‘essential’ to keep benchmark rates at -0.75% and actively intervene. Moreover, the Swiss Central Bank stressed that there is room to cut further and use other expansionary measures given the still high valuation assigned to the Franc, which is stronger than it was at the last quarterly review, especially as risks of further appreciation are deemed to be strong. However, the SNB also flagged unchanged benchmark rates for the entire forecast period (3 years) via its updated economic forecasts and announced that the 3 month Libor will be switched to a new reference rate based on SARON, but this does not constitute any change in policy stance.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the non-US Dollars, as the Loonie was cushioned from the worst risk-off flows by a spike in crude price caused by latest tanker ‘incidents’ in the Gulf of Oman, and despite China accusing Canada for the diplomatic situation over Huawei. Conversely, the Aussie and Kiwi were both hit by aversion and the former inched closer to 0.6900 in wake of overnight data revealing an unexpected uptick in the jobless rate and disproportionate rise in full vs part time workforce breakdown, underpinning RBA easing expectations. Nzd/Usd is hovering just above the base of a 0.6587-57 range as Aud/Nzd meanders midway between 1.0543-07 and attention turns to NZ manufacturing PMI.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All choppy against the Usd as Sterling and the single currency both lost sight of big figures at 1.1300 and 1.2700 respectively for similar and separate reasons. Cable slipped through chart support at 1.2687 (10 and 21 DMA convergence) to a fresh multi-week low as new broke of the 1st Conservative Party run-off vote to find a new leader and it emerged that BoJo won by a bigger margin than expected, with 3 candidates falling out of the race. The Euro retreated further from recent peaks and under downside technical levels at 1.1280 and 1.1273 (near term support and 100 DMA), but the Yen held up better within 108.53-17 on the aforementioned safe-haven grounds.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Usd/Try extended to just shy of 5.9000 at one stage as the Lira weakened on Russian S-400, oil and Turkish reserve developments on top of Dollar strength, while Usd/Zar rallied to 14.9300 before waning as the legal probe into SA President Ramaphosa continued to weigh on sentiment alongside dovish SARB rhetoric. However, Usd/Brl fell to 3.8350 amidst bullish talk on Brazil’s pension reform bill.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Supply concerns in the Strait of Hormuz are spiking energy markets on Thursday</strong>. Two tankers, one Norwegian and one Japanese, have been fired upon by torpedo missiles in the Gulf of Oman; promptly sending prices higher and paring back Wednesday’s losses. Similar to previous attacks in the region, eyes are pointing to Iran, although they have swiftly denied involvement. Worth highlighting that on Wednesday Iran said it would not attack anyone, but if it was attacked, it would defend itself. With details thin and shaky currently, if more unravel that lead to further escalation, crude markets could be set for further bounces, and wider risk assets could come under pressure.</li><li>Meanwhile,<strong> OPEC released its monthly report,</strong> and in fitting with the recent narrative of slowing global growth, cut its 2019 global oil demand forecast to 1.14mln BPD, down 70,000 BPD from previously. On the supply side, it was reported that production fell 236k BPD in May to 29.88mln BPD. Comparing this to the EIA STEO on Tuesday, OPEC’s oil demand downgrade is smaller than the EIA’s 160k BPD cut, however the EIA sees higher total global demand growth at 1.22mln BPD. IEA is next to report on Friday.</li><li>Aside from the Middle East, <strong>geopolitical tensions are rising between the US and Russia</strong>. US President Trump announced on Tuesday he is considering sanctions on Nord Steam 2, the Russian natural gas pipeline project connecting Russia to Germany, warning Germany about being dependent on Russia for fuel. Trump said, “We’re protecting Germany from Russia and Russia is getting billions and billions of dollars from Germany.” The Nord Stream 2 project makes economic sense for Europe, seeing as it needs a steady gas supply, and shipments of LNG from US companies simply cost more; but the risk, as President Trump eagerly alludes to, is that if something “bad” were to happen involving Russia it could bring Europe’s energy supply down with it. Russian President Putin has said in response on Wednesday that tensions with the US are worsening. This comes alongside Trump announcing that the US and Poland would be sending troops to Poland, in a deterrence measure against Russia.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

The new Liffe high is 130.49, +51 ticks, as the 10 year UK benchmark stretched its advantage over Bunds and US Treasuries. Indeed, Bunds recently retreated to a fresh Eurex low of 171.39, -9 ticks vs +17 ticks at best, while 10 year T-notes trimmed gains to zero from 9+ ticks earlier. Note also, some talk of pre-30 year auction hedging amidst another decent slate of corp and other issuance.

Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as the weakness across stocks spurred a flight to quality and amid the declining global yield environment, although the gains in bonds were aggressively pared after an abysmal 30yr auction in which the b/c printed its lowest since November 2017 and the tail in price spiked to 0.87 from 0.03.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 28-day reverse repo for a daily net injection of CNY 90bln.

Sectors are all in the green with the energy sector outperforming (+0.6%) amid the surge in energy prices as two oil tankers were reportedly attacked near the key shipping channel, the Strait of Hormuz (see the Commodities section for a full briefing). Meanwhile, some defensive sectors are lagging its peers with the likes of Utilities (+0.1%) and Consumer Staples (Unch) little changed. Elsewhere, Germany’s 5G auction ended in which raised EUR 6.55bln, above estimates of EUR 3-5bln. Four companies won bids: Deutsche Telekom (+0.7%) won 130MHz, Vodafone (+1.1%) won 130MHz, Telefonica Deutschland (3.5%) won 90MHz and 1&amp;1 Drillisch (+7.5%) won 70MHz. In terms of individual movers, Thales (+2.3%) shares are supported after the Co. raised its EBIT outlook. Wirecard (+3.2%) rose to the top of the DAX amid a positive broker move. On the flip side, ProsiebenSat1 (-3.9%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid ex-dividend trade.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>CHF/AUD -</strong> Flanking the G10 ranks after the SNB refrained from raising its assessment of the Franc from highly valued despite acknowledging that the currency has appreciated since the last quarterly policy review in March and repeating the need to maintain NIRP and intervention. Board members also noted elevated risks of heightened demand for the Chf, more pronounced downside risks to the Swiss economy due to external and reiterated that there is room to loosen the monetary reins further, but signalled steady rates through the 3 year forecast horizon. Note, the 3 month Libor target and range was replaced with a new benchmark rate, but for purely technical reasons and the impending switch from Libor to SARON. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are both lower in wake of the policy pronouncements, statement and revised forecasts for growth and inflation, with the former retreating towards 0.9900 again and latter eyeing 1.1200. Conversely, the Aussie has been undermined by mixed labour data that underpins prospects for another RBA rate cut, with Aud/Usd hovering just above 0.6900 and Aud/Nzd only a few pips away from 1.0500. For the record, headline payrolls beat consensus, but mainly due to temp jobs and the unemployment rate remained unchanged against forecast for a dip, while decent option expiries at 0.6930 look fairly safe at this stage.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY -</strong> The Loonie and Yen are both firmer vs the Greenback amidst an escalation in US-China trade angst and geopolitical concerns, with Usd/Cad easing back between 1.3343-14 parameters and Usd/Jpy holding in a 108.53-17 range. A relatively sharp rebound in crude prices on reports of tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman has underpinned the Loonie, while the Yen is benefiting from a degree of safe-haven positioning, like the Franc and Gold, but also wary of balanced expiry interest given 1.5 bn running off from 107.90-108.10 and 1.6 bn between 108.65-80.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/GBP -</strong> Narrowly mixed vs the Buck as the DXY nestles near 97.000 after the post-US CPI bounce, but is capped ahead of resistance just above the round number in the form of 100 and 10 DMAs (97.020 and 97.033 respectively).

Sectors are all in the green with the energy sector outperforming (+0.6%) amid the surge in energy prices as two oil tankers were reportedly attacked near the key shipping channel, the Strait of Hormuz (see the Commodities section for a full briefing). Meanwhile, some defensive sectors are lagging its peers with the likes of Utilities (+0.1%) and Consumer Staples (Unch) little changed. Elsewhere, Germany’s 5G auction ended in which raised EUR 6.55bln, above estimates of EUR 3-5bln. Four companies won bids: Deutsche Telekom (+0.7%) won 130MHz, Vodafone (+1.1%) won 130MHz, Telefonica Deutschland (3.5%) won 90MHz and 1&amp;1 Drillisch (+7.5%) won 70MHz. In terms of individual movers, Thales (+2.3%) shares are supported after the Co. raised its EBIT outlook. Wirecard (+3.2%) rose to the top of the DAX amid a positive broker move. On the flip side, ProsiebenSat1 (-3.9%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid ex-dividend trade.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>CHF/AUD</strong> - Flanking the G10 ranks after the SNB refrained from raising its assessment of the Franc from highly valued despite acknowledging that the currency has appreciated since the last quarterly policy review in March and repeating the need to maintain NIRP and intervention. Board members also noted elevated risks of heightened demand for the Chf, more pronounced downside risks to the Swiss economy due to external and reiterated that there is room to loosen the monetary reins further, but signalled steady rates through the 3 year forecast horizon. Note, the 3 month Libor target and range was replaced with a new benchmark rate, but for purely technical reasons and the impending switch from Libor to SARON. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are both lower in wake of the policy pronouncements, statement and revised forecasts for growth and inflation, with the former retreating towards 0.9900 again and latter eyeing 1.1200. Conversely, the Aussie has been undermined by mixed labour data that underpins prospects for another RBA rate cut, with Aud/Usd hovering just above 0.6900 and Aud/Nzd only a few pips away from 1.0500. For the record, headline payrolls beat consensus, but mainly due to temp jobs and the unemployment rate remained unchanged against forecast for a dip, while decent option expiries at 0.6930 look fairly safe at this stage.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY</strong> - The Loonie and Yen are both firmer vs the Greenback amidst an escalation in US-China trade angst and geopolitical concerns, with Usd/Cad easing back between 1.3343-14 parameters and Usd/Jpy holding in a 108.53-17 range. A relatively sharp rebound in crude prices on reports of tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman has underpinned the Loonie, while the Yen is benefiting from a degree of safe-haven positioning, like the Franc and Gold, but also wary of balanced expiry interest given 1.5 bn running off from 107.90-108.10 and 1.6 bn between 108.65-80.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/GBP</strong> - Narrowly mixed vs the Buck as the DXY nestles near 97.000 after the post-US CPI bounce, but is capped ahead of resistance just above the round number in the form of 100 and 10 DMAs (97.020 and 97.033 respectively). The single currency is pivoting 1.1300 having failed to close above Fib resistance at 1.1338 on Wednesday, with support coming in around 1.1280 and option expiries nearby at 1.1310-30 (1.1bn) then 1.1345-60 (1.2 bn).

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF/AUD</strong></p><p>Flanking the G10 ranks after the SNB refrained from raising its assessment of the Franc from highly valued despite acknowledging that the currency has appreciated since the last quarterly policy review in March and repeating the need to maintain NIRP and intervention. Board members also noted elevated risks of heightened demand for the Chf, more pronounced downside risks to the Swiss economy due to external and reiterated that there is room to loosen the monetary reins further, but signalled steady rates through the 3 year forecast horizon. Note, the 3 month Libor target and range was replaced with a new benchmark rate, but for purely technical reasons and the impending switch from Libor to SARON. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are both lower in wake of the policy pronouncements, statement and revised forecasts for growth and inflation, with the former retreating towards 0.9900 again and latter eyeing 1.1200. Conversely, the Aussie has been undermined by mixed labour data that underpins prospects for another RBA rate cut, with Aud/Usd hovering just above 0.6900 and Aud/Nzd only a few pips away from 1.0500. For the record, headline payrolls beat consensus, but mainly due to temp jobs and the unemployment rate remained unchanged against forecast for a dip, while decent option expiries at 0.6930 look fairly safe at this stage.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Yen are both firmer vs the Greenback amidst an escalation in US-China trade angst and geopolitical concerns, with Usd/Cad easing back between 1.3343-14 parameters and Usd/Jpy holding in a 108.53-17 range. A relatively sharp rebound in crude prices on reports of tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman has underpinned the Loonie, while the Yen is benefiting from a degree of safe-haven positioning, like the Franc and Gold, but also wary of balanced expiry interest given 1.5 bn running off from 107.90-108.10 and 1.6 bn between 108.65-80.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/GBP</strong></p><p>Narrowly mixed vs the Buck as the <strong>DXY </strong>nestles near 97.000 after the post-US CPI bounce, but is capped ahead of resistance just above the round number in the form of 100 and 10 DMAs (97.020 and 97.033 respectively). The single currency is pivoting 1.1300 having failed to close above Fib resistance at 1.1338 on Wednesday, with support coming in around 1.1280 and option expiries nearby at 1.1310-30 (1.1bn) then 1.1345-60 (1.2 bn). Elsewhere, the Kiwi is seeing some bearish contagion from its Antipodean counterpart, but holding up better vs the Usd within a 0.6587-65 band ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI. Meanwhile, the Pound has lost grip of 1.2700 vs the Usd and Eur/Gbp is back over 0.8900 on no deal Brexit risk in the run up to the start of the Tory leadership race and first elimination vote (due around 13.00BST). Technically, Cable looks contingent on 10/21 DMA convergence that comes in at 1.2687.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira has given up more post-CBRT gains and is now somewhat weaker than it was prior to the policy meet on latest remarks from Turkey reaffirming intentions to go ahead with the Russian S-400 order, and as the Defence Minister claims that Syrian Government forces attacked a Turkish observation post in Idlib. Usd/Try has rebounded towards 5.8500.</p>",

        "content": "<p>10 Candidates have been confirmed for the initial vote on Thursday, 13th June. Candidates are listed below in order of the number of Tory MP’s who have publicly declared their support for them; hence, this order can be used as an approximation for the Tory parties ranking on the candidates.</p><ul><li><strong>Boris Johnson (76)</strong> – The clear frontrunner and bookies favourite to win at this stage. Johnson’s line on Brexit is that he wants the UK to leave the EU on October 31st with or without a deal; and that he wants the Irish Backstop removed from the WA. Most recently, Johnson has ruled out making the GBP 39bln divorce payment to the EU unless improved WA terms are presented.</li><li><strong>Jeremy Hunt (31)</strong> – Seeking to renegotiate the WA, as he believes there is a chance to renegotiate, particularly over the Irish Backstop. Remains prepared for a no-deal Brexit scenario, but firmly believes that changes to the WA can be negotiated and agreed by the 31st October.</li><li><strong>Michael Gove (30)</strong> – Willing to accept a delay, if the EU is prepared to grant one (recent commentary indicates that the EU would be willing to allow a extension if there is seen to be a reasonable chance of an agreement resulting from it) instead of a no-deal scenario; though has previously stated that he wants to leave by October 31st and as such would accept a no-deal Brexit. As such, is prepared to return to Brussels in order to negotiate changes to the backstop.</li><li><strong>Dominic Raab (21)</strong> – Prepared to accept a no-deal Brexit, but seeks to renegotiate a fairer Brexit deal with the EU; to make a offer to replace the Irish Backstop utilising the Malthouse compromise; and leaving on WTO terms is significantly better than leaving with a ‘flawed deal’.</li><li><strong>Sajid Javid (18) </strong>– Believes that a technical solution to the Irish Backstop could vastly improve the WA. However, on this point the EU have stated that while they are open to utilising technical solutions, though this is not a viable option any time soon. Believes preparations need to be made for a no-deal Brexit, but does not seek a hard Brexit.</li><li><strong>Matt Hancock (15)</strong> – Takes the view that a no-deal Brexit is not a viable scenario, as it would be blocked in Parliament; therefore, his accepted scenarios are not leaving or leaving with a deal. Additionally, wants a time-limit to the Irish Backstop with a view to use technology to aid the border issue further down the line.</li><li><strong>Mark Harper (6) </strong>– Wants the UK to achieve a deal, though accepts that leaving without one is still a possibility/option; would look to renegotiate terms around the Irish Backstop.</li><li><strong>Rory Stewart (6)</strong> – Strongly against a no-deal Brexit, viewed as not being a viable option. Believes the focus should be on securing a parliamentary majority for the WA, as he does not believe the EU will offer a alternative deal. Supports the idea of a citizens assembly in order to achieve a compromise on the WA.</li><li><strong>Esther Mcvey (5)</strong> – Strongly supports a no-deal, believes the UK should leave on WTO terms. Would attempt to achieve this by preventing any additional votes on the UK’s exit from the EU prior to the October 31st extension deadline.</li><li><strong>Andrea Leadsom (4)</strong> – The UK’s departure from the EU by October 31st is a ‘hard red line’, which is to occur in all circumstances; after agreeing a exit strategy with the EU in order to protect workers rights. Would look to increasing exit preparations, particularly those concerning alternatives to the Irish Backstop.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Next steps in the Tory Leadership Process:</strong></p><p>- 13th June: First vote on Tory candidates. To advance to the next round a MP must receive at least 16 votes. However, in the scenario they all receive the threshold number of votes then the MP with the least votes is removed.</p><p>- 16th June: UK TV Channel 4 will host a live debate between the candidates.</p><p>- 18th June: Second Vote on Tory Candidates. Candidates who receive under 33 votes are removed from the process. BBC will host a live election debate at this stage, scheduled for 20:00BST.</p><p>- 19th June: Third Vote on Tory Candidates. The candidate with the least number of votes is removed, no minimum threshold at this stage.</p><p>- 20th June: Fourth &amp; Fifth Vote; the 1922 Committee have indicated that there are steps for further votes if required, though this is unlikely. After this stage only two leadership candidates will remain</p><p>- 22nd June: At this stage the approximate 160k Conservative members will begin voting for the next Tory leader, who will become PM.</p><p>- 22nd July: A new Tory leader will be announced at this point, replacing PM May as the standing PM.</p>",

The bullish headlines have significantly eroded the recent downside seen in the complex on both the API and EIA reporting unexpected builds this week; and its worth bearing in mind that we are expecting the OPEC Monthly Oil Report Today, which may provide further upward pressure on prices if they take the same line as the EIA did in their monthly report in downgrading oil demand for both 2019 &amp; 2020.</li></ul>",

(</strong>Yonhap<strong>)</strong></p><p>US</p><p>The curve bull-steepened after a slightly soft CPI report resulted in further bets of looser Fed policy. Trump optimism (though a repeat of his comments from this week) saw slight selling. The Treasury sold 10s, which tailed 0.1bps, and sold at the lowest yield since 2016. The internals were also encouraging, and there has been no sign of a collapse in the foreign bid so far at the Treasury auctions, with indirects taking 65.6% (six auction average 61.8%), and up from the 53.3% at the May auction. Cover was also decent at 2.49, above recent averages. At settlement, the 2s30s part of the curve was almost 5bps steeper. On Thursday, the Treasury will sell USD 16bln of 30s; recent auctions in the 30-year sector have tailed. However, TD Securities suggests that curve steepening might provide demand for long-end debt. Recent averages imply a tail of around 0.4bps, with a 74% buy side takedown (14% directs, 60% indirects). T-note futures (M9) settled 6+ ticks higher at 126-20+.</p><p>US House Oversight Committee voted to hold AG Barr and Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt of Congress regarding dispute on documents related to 2020 census, while there were separate reports that Former White House Communications Director Hick agreed to provide a closed-door testimony to the House committee.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly downbeat following an uninspiring performance on Wall St where all major indices extended on losses as trade uncertainty lingered, with the downside led by energy and financials after a further decline in oil prices and yields. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were subdued but with losses in Australia stemmed as mixed jobs data supported the case for further rate cuts by the RBA, while the Japanese benchmark was pressured as energy names suffered the brunt from the recent 4% drop in crude and with the nation’s largest megabank MUFG weighed as it faces its first ever Q1 loss due to a JPY 300bln impairment related to its Indonesia JV. Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were also weaker after the recent miss on lending data, as well as ongoing trade uncertainty with President Trump continuing to send mixed signals regarding a trade deal and as the Chinese government mouthpiece Global Times suggested Beijing is preparing for ties worsening. Hong Kong underperformed again amid disruptions following the mass protests and as the Legislative Council was set to hold a meeting regarding the extradition bill today, although this was later postponed and stocks gradually rebounded from lows. US equity futures were also active and deteriorated overnight amid the widespread risk averse tone and technical selling in which DJIA futures slipped below the 26k level and Emini Nasdaq 100 pulled back from resistance at 7.5k. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as the weakness across stocks spurred a flight to quality and amid the declining global yield environment, although the gains in bonds were aggressively pared after an abysmal 30yr auction in which the b/c printed its lowest since November 2017 and the tail in price spiked to 0.87 from 0.03.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower following a similar uninspiring performance on Wall St where all major indices marginally extended on losses as trade uncertainty lingered, and with the downside led by energy and financials after a further decline in oil and yields. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are subdued but with losses in Australia stemmed as mixed jobs data supports the case for further rate cuts by the RBA, while the Japanese benchmark is pressured as energy names suffer the brunt from a 4% drop in crude and with the nation’s largest megabank MUFG weighed by news it may post its first ever Q1 loss due to a JPY 300bln impairment related to its Indonesia JV. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are also weaker after the recent miss on lending data, as well as ongoing trade uncertainty as President Trump continues to send mixed signals regarding a US-China trade deal and with the Chinese government mouthpiece Global Times suggesting that Beijing is preparing for ties worsening. Furthermore, the underperformance resumes in Hong Kong on disruptions following the mass protests with government HQ remaining shut and the Legislative Council to hold a meeting regarding the extradition bill today, while US equity futures also deteriorated overnight amid the widespread risk averse tone and technical selling in which DJIA futures slipped below the 26k level and Emini Nasdaq 100 pulled back from resistance at 7.5k.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly eased below the 97.00 level but still holds on to most the prior day’s gains as its main counterparts struggle to nurse recent losses with EUR/USD and GBP/USD below the 1.1300 and 1.2700 handles respectively, with the latter pressured after UK opposition Labour party’s attempts to seize control over parliamentary business and block a no-deal Brexit was defeated by 309 vs 298 votes. Elsewhere, the risk averse tone spurred demand for safe haven JPY and weighed on high-beta currencies with AUD/USD also dragged by mixed jobs data in which headline Employment Change topped estimates but the Unemployment Rate remained at 5.2% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 5.2%), which suggests the RBA remain on track for a further cut this year and saw the Aussie 3yr yield drop to a record low under 1.00%.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as the weakness across stocks spurred a flight to quality and amid the declining global yield environment, while focus turns to the 30yr auction later.</p>",
