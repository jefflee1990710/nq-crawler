The overarching theme was concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. A decent Philly Fed report raises hopes of good regional Fed manufacturing surveys next week, ahead of 2nd March manufacturing ISM; initial jobless claims for the week coincide with the NFP survey period, and augur very well; both these releases helped risk appetite, seeing 10-year T-Notes sell-off by around 4 ticks or so, although the upside for yields was limited. Into afternoon trade, risk had a wobble, which contributed some upside in the fixed income, though ultimately, the complex was relatively stable compared to the slide in equities, although the 3m/10yr spread narrowed further into inversion (low was -6.7bps), lowest since October 2019.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX -0.4% at 3373, NDX -0.9% at 9628, DJI -0.5% at 29,217. </strong>China’s smartphone shipment declined 50%-60% during the 2020 Spring Festival holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak.

China's methodology change in counting cases has drawn apprehension from traders; that anxiety has been compounded after cases soared in South Korea. Additionally, Chinese press wrote that a central Beijing hospital reported 36 novel coronavirus cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase from nine cases from two weeks earlier, leading many to fear a potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital. The risk-bias was always on the back foot as North American traders arrived. A positive batch of data saw yields rise (jobless claims, Philly Fed), but the moves were fleeting, and in afternoon trade, a bout of risk-off bought 10-year yields to within a whisker of 1.50%, amid a 30 points slide in the SPX. During the episode, gold futures' only saw limited upside (it was already sitting near multi-year highs above USD 1,620), and US 10-year yields did not breach 1.50% to the downside. Desks have struggled to specifically explain that downside, though coronavirus fears were commonly cited; others cited technical factors, given the SPX 200dma was 10% below the spot level, the highest ever. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, reasoned that the sell-off might be a combination of valuation frustration, making equities vulnerable to a correction, especially as policymakers warn of stretched valuations; US politics is still a source of political uncertainty (which many desks believe is driving low return expectations for 2020); as well as the coronavirus, and the business disruptions that it brings. Looking ahead, Friday's data slate is key, with PMI data due for release.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> The account from the ECB’s January meeting struck an overall upbeat tone; policymakers are of the view that data pointed to positive but modest growth ahead, with the need for additional data to see if tentative signs of stabilisation will provide a firmer ground for optimism. Further, members were encouraged by the fact that headline and underlying inflation had recently evolved in line with the December staff projections. That said, despite the optimism, market participants will likely look through such commentary given that the meeting preceded a bulk of the recent coronavirus-related growth headwinds. With this in mind, commentary suggesting that “while there might have been a bottoming-out in manufacturing, it was too soon to conclude that the slowdown in growth in the services sector had stopped”, will place extra emphasis on tomorrow’s PMI metrics and, if sub-par, could provide enough ammunition for pessimists on the Governing Council looking for even looser monetary policy in the Eurozone. However, such a viewpoint could be met with pushback from some of the more hawkish policymakers in Frankfurt, with the accounts revealing that concern was expressed about rising stock prices not reflecting improved earnings; something that is likely a by-product of easier financial conditions. As expected, details on the strategic review were relatively limited given the project is in its infancy and in lieu of comments from Lagarde who wanted to approach the evaluation with a clear mind. Overall, the account offered little in the way of fresh insight for market participants with the date of the meeting falling before the escalation in growth concerns as a result of the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>* VIRUS:</strong> There have been conflicting updates on the spread of the coronavirus, which resulted in mixed performance overnight. The fall in daily Chinese reported cases (to 394 from 1,794) was attributed to a change in counting methodology, while cases in South Korea saw a large rise (to 82 from 34 on the previous day). Meanwhile, the Chinese Global Times newspaper reported that a central Beijing hospital reported 36 novel coronavirus cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase from nine cases from two weeks earlier, leading many to fear a potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital.</p><p><strong>* INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> The weekly initial jobless claims data today coincided with the official NFP survey period, and as such, received slightly more attention than usual. The headline came in at 210k, in line with the expected; the four-week moving average fell to 209k, a welcome development since it was around 216,250 heading into the January NFP survey period. Continuing claims, meanwhile, were a touch above expectations at 1.726mln, rising from a revised 1.701mln.</p><p><strong>* PHILLY FED:</strong> It was a blow-out report, which like the Empire State survey earlier in the week, saw an upside surprise for the headline. The forward-looking indicators were also encouraging. Taken in conjunction with the Empire report, there is optimism about the regional manufacturing surveys on the slate to be released ahead of the 2nd March manufacturing ISM report. The data also provides a nod to the Fed, which had recently stated that it thinks manufacturing may have bottomed; naturally, much uncertainty remains, given the unknown impact of the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* DEMOCRAT DEBATE:</strong> Michael Bloomberg underwhelmed, and commentators suggested his debate performance on Wednesday was somewhat rusty. The tearing into Bloomberg by other candidates was expected, and it allowed extreme left candidate Bernie Sanders to go relatively unscathed. From a markets point of view, some observe that a key factor underpinning the recent stocks rally is the idea that US President Trump would be able to beat Sanders easily at the elections in November; accordingly, if Sanders begins to falter in the polls, and it is not market-friendly Bloomberg who is gaining as a result, it could challenge that notion, and it might even provide headwinds for equities.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 0.39 HIGHER AT USD 53.88; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 0.19 HIGHER AT USD 59.31:</strong> The crude complex continued to its rebound, despite the API Wednesday reporting a stock build (product draws provided the bullish impetus). The DoE reported a crude build of 400k, and the products saw draws; initially lending upside in the crude complex. However, gains were limited, and the complex sold off post DoE, despite a smaller build than expected and heavy draws in products. Elsewhere, Exxon’s 503k BPD Beaumont refinery will reportedly take a month to restart is to reportedly take at least a month to restart, according to sources, and once again Russia noted talks are ongoing regarding the JTC recommendation of a 600k BPD production cut. The WTI March contract expired today, therefore price action could have been influenced by book squaring as Europeans left for the day. Of note, Brent’s front-month backwardation continued to widen (to 50c from 0.35 yesterday), and the three-month backwardation rose to 75c from 50c yesterday.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> SPX -0.4% at 3373, NDX -0.9% at 9628, DJI -0.5% at 29,217. <strong>Sectors:</strong> Utilities +0.3%, Materials +0.1%, Staples +0.1%, Discretionary 0.00%, Financials -0.1%, Industrials -0.2%, Energy -0.2%, Telecom -0.6%, Health care -0.6%, Communications -1%, IT -1%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> ViacomCBS (VIAC) were slammed after a dismal report which saw EPS and revenue misses and a decline in cable revenue. Dominos (DPZ) hit all-time highs following its figures which beat on top and bottom lines, whilst reporting US SSS +3.4%. Synopsys (SNPS) were hit on poor revenue guidance, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) was hit following an announcement it expects a USD 0.75/shr hit on EPS as a result of nCoV. Albemarle (ALB) and Newmont Corp (NEM) saw solid reports.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Morgan Stanley (MS) is to acquire E*Trade Financial (ETFC), seeing ETFC surge over 24%. The deal is valued at USD 30bln. The report also highlighted that MS has “been scouring takeover targets in asset management, where it is smaller and nichier than peers”, citing people familiar with the matter. Competitors Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD), who are set to merge, both saw gains on the news. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) are reportedly nearing an agreement on revised merger terms, with an official announcement could potentially be made as soon as today. Under the revised terms, TMUS parent co. Deutsche Telekom will reportedly own 43% of combined company, up from the previously agreed 42%. L Brands (LB) announced it is to sell its majority interest in Victoria Secret to Sycamore Partners for USD 525mln. Once the sale is completed, CEO Wexnar will be stepping down. Marathon Petroleum’s (MPC) speedway unit is in exclusive talks with Seven &amp; I Holdings to be acquired for USD 22bln. Elsewhere, Engie (ENGI FP) reportedly approached Ameresco (AMRC) to show acquisition interest, according to sources.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> China’s smartphone shipment declined 50%-60% during the 2020 Spring Festival holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak. About 60mln smartphones remain unsold, among which Huawei’s devices account for one-third, according to China’s Global Times newspaper, citing reports. Elsewhere, supplier Foxconn (2354 TT) will cautiously resume production in China at its main factories. Yum! Brands (YUM) announced it expects the coronavirus to significantly impact its Q1 results with potential impact continuing beyond Q1 if coronavirus persists. NIO Inc. (NIO) traded higher on reports China is prolonging subsidies for electric vehicles beyond 2020, however Tesla (TSLA) traded with losses paring back some of the prior day gains amid reports it lost one of its most senior executives who was behind the construction of the Tesla Gigafactory’s, according to Electrek.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 11+TICKS HIGHER AT 131-14.</strong> The US Treasury curve bull-flattened, with yields down between 4-5bps at settlement, with major curve spreads all narrowing, though by 2bps max. The overarching theme was concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. A decent Philly Fed report raises hopes of good regional Fed manufacturing surveys next week, ahead of 2nd March manufacturing ISM; initial jobless claims for the week coincide with the NFP survey period, and augur very well; both these releases helped risk appetite, seeing 10-year T-Notes sell-off by around 4 ticks or so, although the upside for yields was limited. Into afternoon trade, risk had a wobble, which contributed some upside in the fixed income, though ultimately, the complex was relatively stable compared to the slide in equities, although the 3m/10yr spread narrowed further into inversion (low was -6.7bps), lowest since October 2019.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The Dollar added to recent gains, and is now eyeing the 100.00 mark, a level it has not vaulted since April 2017. JPY continued its slide, with desks now speculating about the safe haven role of the Japanese currency. GBP fell on USD strength, despite decent retail sales data (again!); Friday's PMI is the key catalyst, for EUR as well. The single currency also added to the recent slide, printing another day of lower lows. Commodity FX (NOK, CAD, RUB) were generally lower, despite crude prices firming for the eighth straight session. EMFX was hammered as the buck flexed its American muscle. And gold continues its March higher, helped out by 3m/10yr yields going deeper into inversion, and is now the highest since Feb 2013.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The yen's slide continues, and while the improvement in global risk sentiment (driven by hopes of China policymakers adding further stimulus to shield the economy from coronavirus-induced downside) in the last couple of days has been the main reason cited for the currency's sharp declines, some desks note that there could be other factors in play: the soft Q4 GDP report raises the risk of recession, while the outbreak of the coronavirus is on its doorstep, while the USD is able to offer liquidity and yield, perhaps usurping the yen's role as the traditional safe haven. HSBC questions whether the yen is losing its haven status, arguing that the primary driver of JPY as a safe haven is supposed to be repatriation and the unwind of carry trades, but if no one is using the yen as a funding currency, perhaps there is no reason for the JPY to trade as a haven, with the bank observing that during some recent episodes, the yen did not exhibit haven characteristics (North Korea, trade war, Iran). HSBC notes that it is rare to see USDJPY and gold surging at the same time (Wednesday is the notable example), and the bank suggests that the reason for this dynamic is that markets are awash with liquidity with very few places to park that excess liquidity.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> China's central bank fixed the yuan above 7.00 against the USD for a second day, and in spot markets USDCNH rose to 7.0550ish in US hours. Overnight the PBOC cut the 1-year LPR rate by 10bps to 4.05%, and the 5-year rate by 5bps to 4.75% (cuts were expected). Elsewhere, S&amp;P cut its forecast for Chinese economic growth in 2020 to 5.00% (China's official target for 2019 was between 6.00-6.50%, and prior to the coronavirus outbreak, reports had suggested it would be 'around 6.00%' in 2020). These official forecasts are usually updated at the National People's Congress, which was scheduled for 5th March, although this date will likely be pushed back due to the outbreak of the coronavirus; a new date will likely be announced after the standing committee meets on 24th February, some speculate.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> A mixed labour market report has seen the AUD fall to lows not seen in a decade. The report showed 13.5k jobs were added in January, a touch above the consensus 10k; the net additions were driven by full-time jobs (+46k) with part-time jobs falling 33k (and paring the 31k rise seen in December). The jobless rate, however, rose to 5.3% (cons 5.2% against a prior 5.1%), a touch above the RBA's assumption of between 5.00-5.25%; the participation rate also rose to 66.09% (from 65.99%), while the underemployment rate rose to 8.6% from 8.3%. Wesptac said the report called into question the RBA's recent optimism, arguing that considerable labour market slack remains, and wage growth is set to remain weak and inconsistent with an economy on a sustainable expansion path. Employment momentum has slowed and considerably so, to be running at a pace below that of population growth, Westpac wrote, and the bank says this is broadly consistent with the overall economic backdrop where output growth is well below trend. After the data, money markets priced the next RBA rate cut for May. Technicians say a close beneath 0.6671 on Thursday opens the door to 0.6550 region.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Retail sales came in above consensus (0.9% M/M vs 0.7% cons); the Y/Y eased to 0.8% from 0.9%, though that was still above the consensus 0.6%. Analysts said the data confirmed that consumer uncertainty lifted after the December election. In terms of the details, the headline was largely dragged by fuel store sales falling by the biggest margin since March 2015, as bad weather drove price rises, although analysts think they will likely recover soon as oil prices have eased. Ahead, Pantheon Macroeconomics said the outlook for the UK consumer is bright, and disposable income will be boosted by government measures (living wage increase, and higher national insurance thresholds), which should allow growth to rise above the MPC's forecasts. As a reminder, at the recent BOE meeting, the MPC stated that it would be closely monitoring the extent to which early indications of an improved outlook are sustained, and follow through to the hard data on domestic activity in coming months; on the face of it, this report augurs well, however, the impact it is likely to have on the pound remains uncertain, given the contentious trade negotiations with the EU are likely to be the driving factor in the months ahead. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* COMING UP - EZ PMIs:</strong> Focus from a Eurozone perspective this week will largely centre around Friday’s Eurozone PMI metrics; services is forecast to slip to 52.1 from 52.5, manufacturing is set to fall further into contractionary territory to 47.5 from 47.9 with the composite at 51.0 from 51.3. The January report noted that “a further rise in the headline PMI to the highest since last August adds to evidence that the tide may be turning for the eurozone economy”, therefore, market participants will be looking for any vindication of this view. Ahead of the release, analysts at Nordea write that the February release will provide some insight into how the Wuhan virus has impacted sentiment in the Eurozone, whilst noting that the “Sentix investor survey, did not show a dramatic fallback, as investors were probably still awaiting more information on the extent to which weakness in China will spill over into the Euro area”; a judgement which could prove to be the case for this month’s release. Note, any disruptions from China will likely be most evident in the manufacturing print given supply chain disruptions from Chinese factories. From a policy point of view, markets currently price in just under 7bps worth of policy loosening by year-end; note, the February PMIs are unlikely to shift the dial on market pricing given the ongoing strategic review (due to be announced in December), which means that the parameters in which the Bank conducts monetary policy are somewhat less clear than they otherwise would be.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP - RIKSBANK MINUTES:</strong> Following the decision to leave rates unchanged at 0.0%, maintain the unchanged rate path and cut CPIF forecasts due to low energy prices focus turns to the minutes. In which focus will be on any further insight into the Bank’s outlook for inflation, particular as Governor Ingves says he does not believe that the expected downside is sufficient to prompt a cut; due to it being almost exclusively on soft energy prices. Additionally, as Breman and Jansson dissented the December rate hike it is somewhat surprising that no commentary from them was run as part of the statement; albeit, there was no mention of any dissention/opposition this time around. As such, the minutes will be looked at for any clues as to how they view the domestic economy and the reiterated unchanged rate path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Of note, Brent’s front-month backwardation continued to widen (to 50c from 0.35 yesterday), and the three-month backwardation rose to 75c from 50c yesterday.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Yen rot continues as USD/JPY takes out 112.00 to the upside",
        "content": "<p>USD/JPY – USD began the session on a firmer footing once again after taking out overnight highs of 99.778 to print a session high of 99.915 (at the time of writing). Once again, there was little in the way of fresh fundamental catalysts behind the USD move with gains instead largely as a result of weakness elsewhere, namely the JPY. Early doors in Europe, USD/JPY took out the overnight high of 111.59 before taking out 112.00 to the upside, before pausing for breath around 112.20, a level, if breached could open up a test of the April 26th high at 112.40. Explanations for the JPY have varied with some leaning on the traditional arguments of selling of JPY by Japanese pension planners to buy US assets; however, others favour focusing on recent disappointing data prints for Japan (Monday’s GDP figures) and concerns over the ramifications of the coronavirus for the nation, something which could impair the Tokyo Olympics this summer. Furthermore, HSBC questions whether the yen is losing its haven status, arguing that the primary driver of JPY as a safe-haven is supposed to be repatriation and the unwind of carry trades, but if no one is using the yen as a funding currency, perhaps there is no reason for the JPY to trade as a haven, with the bank observing that during some recent episodes, the yen did not exhibit haven characteristics (North Korea, trade war, Iran). If JPY declines continue to accelerate, 100.00 in the DXY looks a reasonable bet, with 100.50 marking the April 18th 2017 high. That said, a significant beat on expectations for the Philly Fed Business index was not enough to stoke further gains in the USD and thus could suggest that some are easing back on bullish USD bets.</p><p>EUR – Price action for the shared currency was initially largely dictated by the “King USD” after gains in the greenback knocked the pair below yesterday’s low of 1.0782, to a session trough at 1.0778 (gap support from April 2017). Thereafter the EUR staged a mini-revival to reclaim 1.0800 as bearish EUR/USD bets ran out of steam. However, sentiment for the EUR remains relatively negative and should the EUR continue to fall victim to the USD, technicians’ eye 1.0761 which was the 20th April 2017 high, with not much in the way of support until the 1.0700 figure. ECB minutes provided little in the way of fresh insight for market participants with the date of the meeting falling before the escalation in growth concerns as a result of the coronavirus. As such, focus turns towards tomorrow’s all-important PMI data, ahead of which analysts at Nordea write that the February release will provide some insight into how the Wuhan virus has impacted sentiment in the Eurozone, whilst noting that the “Sentix investor survey, did not show a dramatic fallback, as investors were probably still awaiting more information on the extent to which weakness in China will spill over into the Euro area”; a judgment which could prove to be the case for this month’s release.</p><p>GBP - Momentum for GBP early doors was driven by the pick-up in the USD before the pound dug in and reclaimed 1.2900 to the upside after printing a low of 1.2874, just above the multi-week low of 1.2873 seen on February 10th. Sentiment for the GBP was also bolstered by encouraging retail sales metrics, with all four metrics exceeding expectations amid a pickup in clothing and footwear sales, helping to add to the evidence-pile for those championing the so-called “Boris-bounce”. However, optimism for the GBP was short-lived (in a similar vein to yesterday’s post-CPI move), as GBP/USD lost the 1.2900 status once again and fell towards 1.2850; the low print for the session. In terms of the rationale for the move, there was little in the way of fresh catalysts at the time, however, market participants will be cognizant of the simmering tensions between the UK and EU this week ahead of upcoming trade negotiations at the beginning of next month.</p><p>AUD/NZD -A mixed labour market report saw the AUD fall to lows not seen in a decade. The report showed 13.5k jobs were added in January, a touch above the consensus 10k; the net additions were driven by full-time jobs (+46k) with part-time jobs falling 33k (and paring the 31k rise seen in December). The jobless rate, however, rose to 5.3% (cons 5.2% against a prior 5.1%), a touch above the RBA's assumption of between 5.00-5.25%; the participation rate also rose to 66.09% (from 65.99%), while the underemployment rate rose to 8.6% from 8.3%. In the wake of the release, AUD went on to take out stops at 0.6650 before printing an eventual low at 0.6616 during EU hours alongside USD strength. Technicians say a close beneath 0.6671 on Thursday opens the door to the 0.6550 region. NZD was also been weighed on during the APAC and EU session in sympathy with Aussie losses with the NZD/USD pair being dragged from just shy of 0.6400 to take out 0.6350 to the downside and print a low of 0.6325.</p><p>CNY/KRW/TRY/ZAR - China's central bank fixed the yuan above 7.00 against the USD for a second day, and in spot markets USDCNH rose to 7.04. Overnight the PBOC cut the 1-year LPR rate by 10bps to 4.05%, and the 5-year rate by 5bps to 4.75% (cuts were expected). Elsewhere, S&amp;P cut its forecast for Chinese economic growth in 2020 to 5.00% (China's official target for 2019 was between 6.00-6.50%, and prior to the coronavirus outbreak, reports had suggested it would be 'around 6.00%' in 2020). These official forecasts are usually updated at the National People's Congress, which was scheduled for 5th March, although this date will likely be pushed back due to the outbreak of the coronavirus; a new date will likely be announced after the standing committee meets on 24th February, some speculate. On the coronavirus footing, USD/KRW rose from ~1191.00 and breached mild resistance at 1198.40 (3rd Feb high) before eclipsing 1200.00 to the upside during the APAC session amid increased coronavirus cases in South Korea. Elsewhere, overnight, TRY experienced a spike higher amid thinned volumes and alongside broad EM FX weakness, USD/TRY immediately rose from ~6.0800 to levels north of 6.1000 before completely paring the move to reside on a 6.09 handle. Geopolitical tensions remain a key source of concern for the TRY as Turkey and Russia remain at loggerheads over Syria, with Turkey reportedly asking the US for Patriot missiles to deter Russia in Idlib. Finally, ZAR saw some softness relative to EM peers amid an announcement from ESKOM that rolling blackouts will be imposed in South Africa from today until Saturday, something that will act as a further drag on activity ahead of next week’s budget announcement.</p>",

(</strong>Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European indices kicked the session off on a relatively directionless footing before seeing modest downticks amid increased fears over the spread of coronavirus outside of China. Focus in recent trade has been placed upon developments in Japan and South Korea with the former reporting two passenger deaths abord the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Yokohama, whilst the latter announced a marked pickup in coronavirus cases (total now stands at 104 vs. Prev. 51) and its first death. Sectoral performance has been a mixed bag thus far with price action largely dictated by a slew of large cap earnings, which has seen Telefonica (-5.7%), act as a drag on the Telecom sector following disappointing 2019 profit metrics. Elsewhere, to the upside, post-earnings, Smith &amp; Nephew (+8.5%), Schneider Electric (+5.2%), Fresenius Medical (+4.2%), Fresenius SE (+4.2%), Maersk (+3.7%), Lloyds (+3.3%), Bouygues (+2.7%) and BAE Systems (+2.5%) lead the charge for the Stoxx 600. To the downside, Air France (-8.9%), disappointing earnings release has hampered other airline names, including Deutsche Lufthansa (-3.2%) and RyanAir (-1.8%), whilst corporate updates from Swiss Re (-4.9%) and Axa (-3.0%) has triggered losses in their respective shares.</p><p>China is reportedly considering prolonging electric car subsidies beyond 2020. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD/JPY - </strong>USD began the session on a firmer footing once again after taking out overnight highs of 99.778 to print a session high thus far of 99.875. Once again, there has been little in the way of fresh fundamental catalysts behind the USD move with gains instead largely as a result of weakness elsewhere, namely the JPY. Early doors in Europe, USD/JPY took out the overnight high of 111.59 before taking out 112.00 to the upside (current high of 112.18), which could open up a test of the April 26th high at 112.40. Explanations for the JPY have varied with some leaning on the traditional arguments of selling of JPY by Japanese pension planners to buy US assets; however, others favour focusing on recent disappointing data prints for Japan (Monday’s GDP figures) and concerns over the ramifications of the coronavirus for the nation, something which could impair the Tokyo Olympics this summer. If JPY declines continue to accelerate, 100.00 in the DXY looks a reasonable bet, with 100.50 marking the April 18th 2017 high.</p><p><strong>EUR - </strong>Price action for the shared currency has largely been dictated by the “King USD” after gains in the greenback knocked the pair below yesterday’s low of 1.0782, with the session trough at 1.0778 (gap support from April 2017) at the time of writing. Should the EUR continue to fall victim to the USD, technicians’ eye 1.0761 which was the 20th April 2017 high, with not much in the way of support until the 1.0700 figure. From a fundamental perspective, the main highlight on today’s docket from the Eurozone comes via the minutes from the January ECB meeting (full preview available via the research suite of the website). That said, participants are unlikely to glean too much in the way of fresh insight from the Bank with the meeting itself providing little in the way of fireworks as policymakers tread water ahead of the upcoming strategic review. Furthermore, greater policy guidance from the ECB since the meeting has come from commentary via President Lagarde who noted that low interest rates and low inflation have significantly reduced the scope for the ECB and other central banks to ease monetary policy in the face of an economic downturn.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Momentum for GBP early doors was driven by the pick-up in the USD before the pound dug in and reclaimed 1.2900 to the upside after printing a low of 1.2874, just above the multi-week low of 1.2873 seen on February 10th. Sentiment for the GBP was also bolstered by encouraging retail sales metrics, with all four metrics exceeding expectations amid a pickup in clothing and footwear sales, helping to add to the evidence-pile for those championing the so-called “Boris-bounce”. That said, gains for GBP were relatively fleeting with perhaps some in the market apprehensive amid simmering tensions between the UK and EU this week ahead of upcoming trade negotiations at the beginning of next month.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD - </strong>Focus for the antipodes has largely fallen on AUD given overnight employment figures which saw modest downside in AUD/USD upon the release despite the headline employment change topping estimates (led by full-time employment), as the unemployment rate rose more than expectations, although money market pricing for a March RBA rate cut was largely unchanged. AUD went on to take out stops at 0.6650 before printing an eventual low at 0.6623 (10yr low!); note there is a large AUD 2.1bln expiry in AUD/USD at 0.6700. NZD has also been weighed on during the APAC and EU session in sympathy with Aussie losses with the NZD/USD pair being dragged from just shy of 0.6400 to take out 0.6350 to the downside and print a low of 0.6335.</p><p><strong>CNY/KRW/TRY/ZAR - </strong>USD/CNH saw little action on the expected PBoC LPR rate reductions, although the pair saw upside amid a firmer Dollar, and stabilised ~7.0300. China has continued to reassure the market over the fallout of the coronavirus with the Commerce Ministry stating they will roll out targeted support measures in a timely way to mitigate the impact on firms and consumption. However, some in the market have raised concern over newly revised guidelines by Chinese authorities in classifying coronavirus designations, something which could potentially obfuscate matters further. On the coronavirus footing, USD/KRW rose from ~1191.00 and breached mild resistance at 1198.40 (3rd Feb high) before eclipsing 1200.00 to the upside during the APAC session amid increased coronavirus cases in South Korea. Elsewhere, overnight, TRY experienced a spiker higher amid thinned volumes and alongside broad EM FX weakness, USD/TRY immediately rose from ~6.0800 to levels north of 6.1000 before completely paring the move to reside on a 6.09 handle. Finally, ZAR has seen some softness relative to EM peers amid an announcement from ESKOM that rolling blackouts will be impose in South Africa from today until Saturday, something that will act as a further drag on activity ahead of next week’s budget announcement.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment (Jan) 13.5k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 28.9k) (Newswires) Australian Unemployment Rate (Jan) 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.2% (Prev. 5.1%)</strong> Australian Participation Rate (Jan) 66.1% vs. Exp. 66.0% (Prev. 66.0%) Australian Full Time Employment (Jan) 46.2k (Prev. -0.3k)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core debt</strong> kicked off the European session on a relatively uneventful front, after an action packed APAC session saw a gradual grind higher in UST’s and Bunds; with this perhaps emanating after the PBOC’s cut which was largely as expected albeit some participants were looking for more via the 5-year LPR. However, ING have caveated that this smaller cut for the longer term rate may well be to prevent excess spending from low borrowing costs as happened in 2007/08. Returning to European hours, where the complex was bolstered on reports of a first coronavirus death in South Korea; remarks which sent <strong>Bunds</strong> to session highs just shy of the 175.0 handle at 174.91, however, the move was relatively short lived. From a technical perspective, resistance above 175.0 lies at 175.07, before 175.10 and January’s high of 175.30. Across the channel from their European peers <strong>Gilts</strong> were similarly lifted on the virus headlines but the majority of their price action is data driven. Strong retail sales figures initially sparked a test of 134.0 to the downside, a handle which subsequently broke to a low print for the session a 133.91; downside which was felt in sympathy across core peers. However, the dip was short-lived as focus for the UK economy remains on tomorrow’s Flash PMI’s; particularly as the BoE have begun placing additional emphasis on activity data. Looking ahead, the main European highlight is the ECB minutes although not too much is expected ahead of the strategic review. Stateside, a number of data prints will draw interest as will remarks from Fed’s Barkin (Non-Voter) after Kashkari departed somewhat from his usually firmly dovish tone yesterday; acknowledging the potential for the next move to be a hike. <strong>UST</strong> focus remain firmly on the 10-year yield, which is continuing to creep away from, but remains in proximity to, the key 1.50 area.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> prices are essentially unchanged on the day with less that USD 0.15/bbl of variation from flat at present. Newsflow specific to the complex has been slow for much of the session, with price action initially moving in tandem with the overall risk picture as main equity bourses are similarly little moved overall. Focus overnight was on the ongoing demand concerns stemming from the coronavirus, with reports this morning of a death in South Korea prompting some mild weakness; as well as the private crude inventories which printed a larger than expected headline build. Although, the internals did feature surprise/bigger draws for gasoline and distillates respectively. As we await Russia’s stance on the JTC’s recommendations interest was piqued by remarks from Energy Minister Novak but to no avail on the production cut recommendations; although, he did firmly push back on the need for an early meeting which, alongside the short proximity to the original March date, means a early meeting is all but off the table. Looking ahead, today sees the release of the EIA weekly crude report at the slightly later time of 16:00GMT/11:00EST; expectations are for a build of 2.49mln which would be just over half of the API’s 4.2mln build last night; while internal estimates are in proximity to those forecast for last nights numbers. Moving to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> is currently little changed but is comfortably above the USD 1600/oz mark, with a YTD high of USD 1612.93/oz yesterday which takes us back to levels not seen since 2013.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 14th Feb) +4.2mln (exp. +2.5mln, prev. +6mln) (Newswires) </strong>- Cushing +0.4mln (prev. +1.3mln) - Gasoline -2.7mln (exp.+0.4mln, prev. +1.1mln) - Distillates -2.6mln (exp. –1.5mln, prev. -2.3mln)</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak says we continue to discuss the market, not expedient to hold OPEC+ meeting ahead of schedule should meet in March as planned; does not say if Russia will support deeper oil output cuts.

Focus in recent trade has been placed upon developments in Japan and South Korea with the former reporting two passenger deaths abord the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Yokohama, whilst the latter announced a marked pickup in coronavirus cases (total now stands at 104 vs. Prev. 51) and its first death. Sectoral performance has been a mixed bag thus far with price action largely dictated by a slew of large cap earnings, which has seen Telefonica (-5.7%), act as a drag on the Telecom sector following disappointing 2019 profit metrics. Elsewhere, to the upside, post-earnings, Smith &amp; Nephew (+8.5%), Schneider Electric (+5.2%), Fresenius Medical (+4.2%), Fresenius SE (+4.2%), Maersk (+3.7%), Lloyds (+3.3%), Bouygues (+2.7%) and BAE Systems (+2.5%) lead the charge for the Stoxx 600. To the downside, Air France (-8.9%), disappointing earnings release has hampered other airline names, including Deutsche Lufthansa (-3.2%) and RyanAir (-1.8%), whilst corporate updates from Swiss Re (-4.9%) and Axa (-3.0%) has triggered losses in their respective shares</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD/JPY - </strong>USD began the session on a firmer footing once again after taking out overnight highs of 99.778 to print a session high thus far of 99.875. Once again, there has been little in the way of fresh fundamental catalysts behind the USD move with gains instead largely as a result of weakness elsewhere, namely the JPY. Early doors in Europe, USD/JPY took out the overnight high of 111.59 before taking out 112.00 to the upside (current high of 112.18), which could open up a test of the April 26th high at 112.40. Explanations for the JPY have varied with some leaning on the traditional arguments of selling of JPY by Japanese pension planners to buy US assets; however, others favour focusing on recent disappointing data prints for Japan (Monday’s GDP figures) and concerns over the ramifications of the coronavirus for the nation, something which could impair the Tokyo Olympics this summer. If JPY declines continue to accelerate, 100.00 in the DXY looks a reasonable bet, with 100.50 marking the April 18th 2017 high.</p><p><strong>EUR - </strong>Price action for the shared currency has largely been dictated by the “King USD” after gains in the greenback knocked the pair below yesterday’s low of 1.0782, with the session trough at 1.0778 (gap support from April 2017) at the time of writing. Should the EUR continue to fall victim to the USD, technicians’ eye 1.0761 which was the 20th April 2017 high, with not much in the way of support until the 1.0700 figure. From a fundamental perspective, the main highlight on today’s docket from the Eurozone comes via the minutes from the January ECB meeting (full preview available via the research suite of the website). That said, participants are unlikely to glean too much in the way of fresh insight from the Bank with the meeting itself providing little in the way of fireworks as policymakers tread water ahead of the upcoming strategic review. Furthermore, greater policy guidance from the ECB since the meeting has come from commentary via President Lagarde who noted that low interest rates and low inflation have significantly reduced the scope for the ECB and other central banks to ease monetary policy in the face of an economic downturn.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Momentum for GBP early doors was driven by the pick-up in the USD before the pound dug in and reclaimed 1.2900 to the upside after printing a low of 1.2874, just above the multi-week low of 1.2873 seen on February 10th. Sentiment for the GBP was also bolstered by encouraging retail sales metrics, with all four metrics exceeding expectations amid a pickup in clothing and footwear sales, helping to add to the evidence-pile for those championing the so-called “Boris-bounce”. That said, gains for GBP were relatively fleeting with perhaps some in the market apprehensive amid simmering tensions between the UK and EU this week ahead of upcoming trade negotiations at the beginning of next month.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD - </strong>Focus for the antipodes has largely fallen on AUD given overnight employment figures which saw modest downside in AUD/USD upon the release despite the headline employment change topping estimates (led by full-time employment), as the unemployment rate rose more than expectations, although money market pricing for a March RBA rate cut was largely unchanged. AUD went on to take out stops at 0.6650 before printing an eventual low at 0.6623 (10yr low!); note there is a large AUD 2.1bln expiry in AUD/USD at 0.6700. NZD has also been weighed on during the APAC and EU session in sympathy with Aussie losses with the NZD/USD pair being dragged from just shy of 0.6400 to take out 0.6350 to the downside and print a low of 0.6335.</p><p><strong>CNY/KRW/TRY/ZAR - </strong>USD/CNH saw little action on the expected PBoC LPR rate reductions, although the pair saw upside amid a firmer Dollar, and stabilised ~7.0300. China has continued to reassure the market over the fallout of the coronavirus with the Commerce Ministry stating they will roll out targeted support measures in a timely way to mitigate the impact on firms and consumption. However, some in the market have raised concern over newly revised guidelines by Chinese authorities in classifying coronavirus designations, something which could potentially obfuscate matters further. On the coronavirus footing, USD/KRW rose from ~1191.00 and breached mild resistance at 1198.40 (3rd Feb high) before eclipsing 1200.00 to the upside during the APAC session amid increased coronavirus cases in South Korea. Elsewhere, overnight, TRY experienced a spiker higher amid thinned volumes and alongside broad EM FX weakness, USD/TRY immediately rose from ~6.0800 to levels north of 6.1000 before completely paring the move to reside on a 6.09 handle. Finally, ZAR has seen some softness relative to EM peers amid an announcement from ESKOM that rolling blackouts will be impose in South Africa from today until Saturday, something that will act as a further drag on activity ahead of next week’s budget announcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core debt</strong> kicked off the European session on a relatively uneventful front, after an action packed APAC session saw a gradual grind higher in UST’s and Bunds; with this perhaps emanating after the PBOC’s cut which was largely as expected albeit some participants were looking for more via the 5-year LPR. However, ING have caveated that this smaller cut for the longer term rate may well be to prevent excess spending from low borrowing costs as happened in 2007/08. Returning to European hours, where the complex was bolstered on reports of a first coronavirus death in South Korea; remarks which sent <strong>Bunds</strong> to session highs just shy of the 175.0 handle at 174.91, however, the move was relatively short lived. From a technical perspective, resistance above 175.0 lies at 175.07, before 175.10 and January’s high of 175.30. Across the channel from their European peers <strong>Gilts</strong> were similarly lifted on the virus headlines but the majority of their price action is data driven. Strong retail sales figures initially sparked a test of 134.0 to the downside, a handle which subsequently broke to a low print for the session a 133.91; downside which was felt in sympathy across core peers. However, the dip was short-lived as focus for the UK economy remains on tomorrow’s Flash PMI’s; particularly as the BoE have begun placing additional emphasis on activity data. Looking ahead, the main European highlight is the ECB minutes although not too much is expected ahead of the strategic review. Stateside, a number of data prints will draw interest as will remarks from Fed’s Barkin (Non-Voter) after Kashkari departed somewhat from his usually firmly dovish tone yesterday; acknowledging the potential for the next move to be a hike. <strong>UST</strong> focus remain firmly on the 10-year yield, which is continuing to creep away from, but remains in proximity to, the key 1.50 area.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> prices are essentially unchanged on the day with less that USD 0.15/bbl of variation from flat at present. Newsflow specific to the complex has been slow for much of the session, with price action initially moving in tandem with the overall risk picture as main equity bourses are similarly little moved overall. Focus overnight was on the ongoing demand concerns stemming from the coronavirus, with reports this morning of a death in South Korea prompting some mild weakness; as well as the private crude inventories which printed a larger than expected headline build. Although, the internals did feature surprise/bigger draws for gasoline and distillates respectively. As we await Russia’s stance on the JTC’s recommendations interest was piqued by remarks from Energy Minister Novak but to no avail on the production cut recommendations; although, he did firmly push back on the need for an early meeting which, alongside the short proximity to the original March date, means a early meeting is all but off the table. Looking ahead, today sees the release of the EIA weekly crude report at the slightly later time of 16:00GMT/11:00EST; expectations are for a build of 2.49mln which would be just over half of the API’s 4.2mln build last night; while internal estimates are in proximity to those forecast for last nights numbers. Moving to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> is currently little changed but is comfortably above the USD 1600/oz mark, with a YTD high of USD 1612.93/oz yesterday which takes us back to levels not seen since 2013.</p>",

However, the dip was short-lived as focus for the UK economy remains on tomorrow’s Flash PMI’s; particularly as the BoE have begun placing additional emphasis on activity data. Looking ahead, the main European highlight is the ECB minutes although not too much is expected ahead of the strategic review. Stateside, a number of data prints will draw interest as will remarks from Fed’s Barkin (Non-Voter) after Kashkari departed somewhat from his usually firmly dovish tone yesterday; acknowledging the potential for the next move to be a hike. <strong>UST</strong> focus remain firmly on the 10-year yield, which is continuing to creep away from, but remains in proximity to, the key 1.50 area.</p>",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour – Dollar continues its charge towards 100.00 as JPY remains unloved ",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD/JPY</strong></p><p>USD began the session on a firmer footing once again after taking out overnight highs of 99.778 to print a session high thus far of 99.863. Once again, there has been little in the way of fresh fundamental catalysts behind the USD move with gains instead largely as a result of weakness elsewhere, namely the JPY. Early doors in Europe, USD/JPY took out the overnight high of 111.59 before taking out 112.00 to the upside, which could open up a test of the April 26th high at 112.40. Explanations for the JPY have varied with some leaning on the traditional arguments of selling of JPY by Japanese pension planners to buy US assets; however, others favour focusing on recent disappointing data prints for Japan (Monday’s GDP figures) and concerns over the ramifications of the coronavirus for the nation, something which could impair the Tokyo Olympics this summer. If JPY declines continue to accelerate, 100.00 in the DXY looks a reasonable bet, with 100.50 marking the April 18th 2017 high.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Price action for the shared currency has largely been dictated by the “King USD” after gains in the greenback knocked the pair below yesterday’s low of 1.0782, with the session trough at 1.0778 (gap support from April 2017) at the time of writing. Should the EUR continue to fall victim to the USD, technicians’ eye 1.0761 which was the 20th April 2017 high, with not much in the way of support until the 1.0700 figure. From a fundamental perspective, the main highlight on today’s docket from the Eurozone comes via the minutes from the January ECB meeting (full preview available via the research suite of the website). That said, participants are unlikely to glean too much in the way of fresh insight from the Bank with the meeting itself providing little in the way of fireworks as policymakers tread water ahead of the upcoming strategic review. Furthermore, greater policy guidance from the ECB since the meeting has come from commentary via President Lagarde who noted that low interest rates and low inflation have significantly reduced the scope for the ECB and other central banks to ease monetary policy in the face of an economic downturn.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Momentum for GBP early doors was driven by the pick-up in the USD before the pound dug in and reclaimed 1.2900 to the upside after printing a low of 1.2884 and avoiding a test of the multi-week low of 1.2873 seen on February 10th. Sentiment for the GBP was also bolstered by encouraging retail sales metrics, with all four metrics exceeding expectations amid a pickup in clothing and footwear sales, helping to add to the evidence-pile for those championing the so-called “Boris-bounce”. That said, gains for GBP were relatively fleeting with perhaps some in the market apprehensive amid simmering tensions between the UK and EU this week ahead of upcoming trade negotiations at the beginning of next month.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Focus for the antipodes has largely fallen on AUD given overnight employment figures which saw modest downside in AUD/USD upon the release despite the headline employment change topping estimates (led by full-time employment), as the unemployment rate rose more than expectations, although money market pricing for a March RBA rate cut was largely unchanged. AUD went on to take out stops at 0.6650 before printing an eventual low at 0.6623; note there is a large AUD 2.1bln expiry in AUD/USD at 0.6700. NZD has also been weighed on during the APAC and EU session in sympathy with Aussie losses with the NZD/USD pair being dragged from just shy of 0.6400 to take out 0.6350 to the downside and print a low of 0.6337.</p><p><strong>CNY/KRW/TRY/ZAR</strong></p><p>USD/CNH saw little action on the expected PBoC LPR rate reductions, although the pair saw upside amid a firmer Dollar, and stabilised ~7.0300. China has continued to reassure the market over the fallout of the coronavirus with the Commerce Ministry stating they will roll out targeted support measures in a timely way to mitigate the impact on firms and consumption. However, some in the market have raised concern over newly revised guidelines by Chinese authorities in classifying coronavirus designations, something which could potentially obfuscate matters further. On the coronavirus footing, USD/KRW rose from ~1191.00 and breached mild resistance at 1198.40 (3rd Feb high) before eclipsing 1200.00 to the upside during the APAC session amid increased coronavirus cases in South Korea. Elsewhere, overnight, TRY experienced a spiker higher amid thinned volumes and alongside broad EM FX weakness, USD/TRY immediately rose from ~6.0800 to levels north of 6.1000 before completely paring the move to reside on a 6.08 handle. Finally, ZAR has seen some softness relative to EM peers amid an announcement from ESKOM that rolling blackouts will be impose in South Africa from today until Saturday, something that will act as a further drag on activity ahead of next week’s budget announcement.</p>",

The optimistic sentiment in the region faded following the number of coronavirus cases in South Korea rising by 60%, and amid reports of two deaths from the Japanese cruise ship. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.3%) was buoyed by its large-cap mining and energy sector, following recent gains in the respective complexes. Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) initially posted gains of over 1.5% with upside originally fuelled by a considerably weaker JPY, although the index later pulled back with a chunk of its transport stocks in the red, and amid reports that multinational companies are avoiding travel to and from Japan over fears that the country will be the next hotspot in the outbreak. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) erased opening gains and underperformed as a bulk of its stocks reversed course into negative territory, and with its heavyweight financial sector on the defensive. Meanwhile, Shanghai Comp (+1.0%) rebounded with a vengeance in late trade and topped the 3000 mark for the first time since before the Lunar New Year, after initially swinging between gains and losses despite the expected stimulus measures by the PBoC, as traders were cautious following the case jump in South Korea and deaths on the cruise ship off Yokohama, with the former prompting South Korea’s KOSPI (-0.5%) to trade with losses of almost 1.0% at one point.</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>Anglo American (AAL LN) - </strong>Concerns over the Co.'s takeover of Sirius Minerals have heightened after hedge fund Odey Asset Management has announced that it opposes the deal.

(Newswires)</strong></p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mixed having pared a bulk of earlier gains </strong>despite the promising lead from Wall Street which saw the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq print fresh record highs. The optimistic sentiment in the region faded following the number of coronavirus cases in South Korea rising by 60%, and amid reports of two deaths from the Japanese cruise ship. Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.3%)</strong> was buoyed by its large-cap mining and energy sector, following recent gains in the respective complexes. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.4%)</strong> initially posted gains of over 1.5% with upside originally fuelled by a considerably weaker JPY, although the index later pulled back with a chunk of its transport stocks in the red, and amid reports that multinational companies are avoiding travel to and from Japan over fears that the country will be the next hotspot in the outbreak. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.9%)</strong> erased opening gains and underperformed as a bulk of its stocks reversed course into negative territory, and with its heavyweight financial sector on the defensive. Meanwhile, <strong>Shanghai Comp (+1.0%)</strong> rebounded with a vengeance in late trade and topped the 3000 mark for the first time since before the Lunar New Year, after initially swinging between gains and losses despite the expected stimulus measures by the PBoC, as traders were cautious following the case jump in South Korea and deaths on the cruise ship off Yokohama, with the former prompting South Korea’s <strong>KOSPI (-0.5%)</strong> to trade with losses of almost 1.0% at one point.</p><p><strong>Chinese PBoC LPR Rate 1yr 4.05% vs Exp. 4.05% (Prev. 4.15%) (Newswires)</strong> Chinese PBoC LPR Rate 5yr 4.75% (Prev. 4.80%)</p><p><strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.0026 vs. Exp. 7.0025 (Prev. 7.0012) (Newswires)</strong> PBOC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position</p><p>China has issued a list of US agricultural products that will be eligible for tariff waivers, according to sources in a move that signifies China have re-entered the market for US ags.

Meanwhile, policymakers cited easing of trade tensions, receding Brexit risks and stabilising global growth as reducing downside risks but also generally expected trade uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated. Furthermore, the release noted that once reserves reach ample levels, regular open market operations would be required over time to accommodate trend growth in Fed’s liabilities and maintain ample reserves and several participants suggested committee resume before long discussion of possibly creating a standard repo facility. <i><strong>Market reaction was muted as the release was in-line with expectations and Fed rhetoric.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Fed's Kashkari (Voter, Dove) said if he was to guess, rates will likely be where they are for the next three to six months, and the next move would be a cut, but if there were a positive shock, hikes could be called for.</strong> When asked about the impact of the coronavirus, he said all the data he sees from China is viewed with a sceptical eye and added that it is unlikely that the US would be immune from virus-related slowdown.

Elsewhere, <strong>Antipodean</strong> came under pressure throughout the session, <strong>AUD/USD</strong> saw modest downside upon the release of the Aussie Labor Force figures despite the headline employment change topping estimates (led by full-time employment), as the unemployment rate rose more than expectations, although money market pricing for a March RBA rate cut was largely unchanged. Losses in the pairs coincided with the PBoC’s LPR reductions and were exacerbated to an extent by soured sentiment in South Korea – a key APAC proxy – as the number of coronavirus cases in the country rose dramatically, prompting losses in the <strong>KRW</strong>. <strong>AUD/USD</strong> took out stops at 0.6650 before printing a low of around 0.6630, <strong>NZD/USD</strong> fell in sympathy to test support at 0.6350, having declined from levels of just shy of 0.6400. Meanwhile, <strong>USD/KRW</strong> rose from ~1191.00 and breached mild resistance at 1198.40 (3rd Feb high) before eclipsing 1200 to the upside. <strong>USD/CNH</strong> saw little action on the expected PBoC LPR rate reductions, although the pair saw upside amid a firmer Dollar, and stabilised ~7.0300. Finally, <strong>TRY</strong> experienced a mini flash-crash amid thinned volumes and alongside broad EM FX weakness, <strong>USD/TRY</strong> immediately rose from ~6.0800 to levels north of 6.1000 before completely paring the move.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment (Jan) 13.5k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 28.9k) (Newswires) Australian Unemployment Rate (Jan) 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.2% (Prev. 5.1%)</strong> Australian Participation Rate (Jan) 66.1% vs. Exp. 66.0% (Prev. 66.0%) Australian Full Time Employment (Jan) 46.2k (Prev. -0.3k)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures were choppy within tight ranges, although prices waned off highs as sentiment deteriorated during Asia-Pac hours following further coronavirus spreading and deaths outside of China. Prices saw modest upside following the Private Inventory report, despite a larger-than-expected headline crude build amid bullish internals, in which <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> Apr’20 futures rose above USD 54/bbl and 59.50/bbl before falling back below the psychological levels overnight. As a reminder, the weekly EIA crude stocks will be released today at 1600GMT on account of Monday’s US market holiday. Meanwhile, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> notched fresh multi-year highs of 1612.89/oz in late US trade in what seemed to be more of a tech-driven move, but thereafter upside abated as the yellow metal succumbed to the firmer USD. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices gave up earlier gains induced by PBoC stimulus hopes, amid the stronger Buck coupled with the fading in overall optimism across the market, with prices back below the key 2.6/lb mark. Finally, <strong>Chinese</strong> <strong>steel</strong> <strong>futures</strong> rose in early trade on hopes that the PBoC’s LPR cut will help revive demand.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 14th Feb) +4.2mln (exp. +2.5mln, prev. +6mln) (Newswires) </strong>- Cushing +0.4mln (prev. +1.3mln) - Gasoline -2.7mln (exp.+0.4mln, prev. +1.1mln) - Distillates -2.6mln (exp. –1.5mln, prev. -2.3mln)</p><p>Exxon's 503k BPD Baton Rouge refinery is reportedly to take at least a month to restart, according to sources.

Risk sentiment notably improved on hopes of China stimulus, while the coronavirus narrative now seems to be coalescing on the notion of a V-shaped recovery; the US data docket has also been supportive, adding to the argument that the expansion can continue.
