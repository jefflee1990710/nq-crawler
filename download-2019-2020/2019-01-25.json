Of Michigan., US PCE (TBC), US Chicago PMI, China PMIs, Eurozone GDP Flash &amp; Unemployment, Canadian PPI, Japan Labour Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>US President Trump declared he had reached a tentative deal with lawmakers to end the government shutdown until February 15th. The deal does not include funding for the border wall which Trump desired and he threat the use of national security measures if a deal for it is not reached. He asked Senate Republican leader McConnell to put the proposal on the floor immediately for a vote and added that a bipartisan conference committee will begin reviewing border security requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Ahead of US/China trade talks on 30-31 January in Washington, there have been mixed signals from officials on the progress made, though there are some encouraging signs. Commerce Secretary Ross this week said the sides remained &ldquo;miles and miles&rdquo; apart, which injected jitters into risk assets, despite him adding that there was a &ldquo;fair chance&rdquo; a deal could be reached. Remarks from the National Economic Council director Kudlow suggested that the President was optimistic about the trade talks. Trump himself said the talks were going &ldquo;very well,&rdquo; and again said that Beijing wants to strike a deal to end the trade war, adding that the US is doing &ldquo;very well in the negotiations&rdquo;; this was a line echoed by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin subsequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> As the clock ticks down to March 29th, we this week saw a lack of any noteworthy progress for the UK in trying to secure its exit from the EU, with attention now moving on Tuesday&rsquo;s Parliamentary showdown. In terms of the developments, the EU continued to reiterate that it is simply unwilling to renegotiate with the UK with little expected from discussions unless the UK is willing to shift its red lines. Back home, UK opposition leader Corbyn has continued to refuse to engage in discussions with PM May as he ponders his next move whilst leading his equally fractured party with some Labour MPs attempting to pivot Parliament towards voting for a softer Brexit. House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the EU could delay Brexit to get a deal through, she added that the backstop issue must be resolved then many conservative MPs and the DUP could get behind PM May&#39;s deal. Fears of a potentially softer Brexit or no Brexit has seen a cooling in the rhetoric of some arch-Brexiteers with reports suggesting Former Foreign Minister Johnson could back May&rsquo;s plan (subject to a time-limited backstop), whilst ERG head Rees-Mogg has stated that a reformed Brexit deal could win over critics. This has all come in the run up to Tuesday 29th (1900GMT) which will see UK lawmakers vote on a series of potential amendments to UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal with the aim of unlocking the currently Parliamentary deadlock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Russia&#39;s Foreign Minister said he is ready to cooperate with all political forces in Venezuela showing a responsible approach and he is prepared to mediate between Venezuela&#39;s authorities and the opposition if needed. Maduro said they are ready to ship oil exports away from the US if needed and the refiner Citgo is property of the state which will be defended. The US lobbied UK officials to cut off the Maduro regime from gold and UK reportedly denied maduro&#39;s bid to pull out USD 1.2bln of gold. Elsewhere, France&#39;s Foreign Minister said to be ready to impose strong sanctions on Iran if there is no progress in talks over its ballistic missile programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>The WSJ reported that Fed officials are reportedly weighing an earlier than anticipated end to bond portfolio runoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas stated that there is no reason to change ECB guidance at this point. ECB&#39;s Villeroy said that they remain committed to keeping interest rates low and believes the ECB will probably downgrade the GDP forecast in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.56 HIGHER AT USD 53.69/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.55 HIGHER AT USD 61.64/BBL. </strong>Crude prices moved modestly higher today as the market digested supply concerns in the fallout of Venezuela&rsquo;s political crisis. Conversely, gains were limited as US-China trade tensions lingered on sentiment. News-flow saw Russia&rsquo;s Head of Russian Direct Investment Fund say that the country was comfortable with oil prices between USD 60-70/bbl, as well as Russia becoming China&rsquo;s largest crude supplier in 2018 for the third year in a row. Baker Hughes Rig Count (25/Jan) recorded oil rigs up 10 at 862, nat gas down 1 at 197, total up 9 at 1059; overall, US drillers cut 23 rigs in January, the most cuts in a month since April 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.81% at 2664, NASDAQ +1.27% at 6787, DJI +0.72% at 24729. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.18%, Materials +1.86%, Industrials +1.27%, Cons Discretionary +1.03%, Cons Staples -0.15%, Healthcare +0.04%, Financials +0.72%, Tech +1.38%, Telecoms +1.02%, Utilities -1.33%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Intel (INTC) underperformed after missing revenue estimates, putting a dampener on the semiconductor sector; however Western Digital (WDC) provided some relief as it outperformed following positive revenue guidance. AbbVie (ABV) traded lower after missing top and bottom line estimates. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) had a volatile early session before moving into the red as the market digested its disappointing profit forecast. Starbucks (SBUX) opened higher following stronger than expected EPS and revenue figures. ResMed (RMD) nosedived on the back of lower than expected revenue for its Q2 as well as a downgrade at JPMorgan. General Electric (GE) and Wabtec (WAB) surged after they announced a modifications to their merger agreement. Broker moves saw Valero (VLO) and Cognizant (CTSH) outperform after upgrades at Goldman and Bernstein respectively, Illumina (ILMN) underperformed after a downgrade at Deutsche Bank. Albemarle (ALB) opened in the green on the announcement it had reached a resolution with the Chilean Economic Development Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 11 TICKS LOWER AT 121-13. </strong>The complex drifted lower on Friday as equities rebounded as investors are hopeful on a mix of key events next week including US and China trade talks and the Fed interest rate decision. Rumours of a potential end to the government shutdown pushed treasuries to new lows; the complex remained around these levels after US President Trump confirmed a tentative deal has been reached with lawmakers to end the government shutdown until February 15th. Most of the actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were narrowly mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>A roller-coaster week for the Buck, but ultimately the index is poised to end Friday&#39;s (EU) session on the backfoot. The week kicked off with MLK day and volatile Dollar trade after the DXY opened around 96.350 in thinned liquidity upon the release of the IMF&rsquo;s global growth forecast downgrade. Trade has been the main factor swinging the Buck this week, as reports of little progress from US-Sino talks sent the DXY to a weekly high of 96.680 (vs. 95.900 low) ahead of the Chinese trade delegation&rsquo;s trip to Washington on Monday, while EUR weakness post-ECB provided the index with extra impetus. However, the Dollar is now weaker again amidst a general improvement in risk sentiment ahead of the FOMC policy meeting next week, with the Board of Governors&rsquo; narrative shifting towards the dovish end of the scale. Next week also sees talks between China Vice Premier Liu He, USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Wednesday, while Thursday is SOMA day in which a drain of 18.2bln in USD liquidity will take place, and finally on Friday markets will see the release of the latest US jobs data which will factor in the furloughed employees from the US government shutdown. ING noted that the 800k workers affected by the shutdown represent only 0.5% of the total NFP tally and added that the impact on the economy will be modest, but noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>An impressive recovery in the single currency after plumbing the depths to sub 1.1300 vs. the Dollar, initially triggered by dismal PMI figures from France and the downside exacerbated by the ECB tweaking its balance of risks statement to &ldquo;moved to the downside&rdquo; from &ldquo;moving to the downside&rdquo;. This, alongside mid-week trade-related USD strength sent EUR/USD to a weekly base at 1.1289 (vs. high 1.1410) before rebounding to levels north of 1.1350 on the last trading session of the week. The week also saw the source reports that the European Commission are to cut Italy&rsquo;s GDP forecast to 0.6% or &ldquo;slightly below&rdquo; from the current 1.2%, while the German government cut its domestic 2019 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.8%. Looking ahead, the coming week sees ECB President Draghi speaking at the European Parliament on Monday, EZ flash GDP on Thursday and flash CPI on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Another week of gains for Sterling as ongoing hopes of an Article 50 extension provided stimulus for the via an unwinding of some Brexit risk premium. However, the biggest boost for the Pound came in early Asia trade on Thursday as a Sun article emerged stating that PM May&rsquo;s coalition party, the DUP, is willing to back her Brexit deal if the Premier can get an expiry date to the backstop, though this is widely expected to be rejected by the EU. Nonetheless, the prospect of some sort of unification in the UK government propelled Cable past 1.3100 to the upside to hit a weekly peak (and a 2-month high) at 1.3163 vs. a low of 1.2831. Focus now turns to next Tuesday where Parliament will vote on PM May&rsquo;s Plan B, alongside amendments, which largely aim at delaying Brexit or taking a no-deal scenario off the table (refer to the Week in Focus full details).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The antipodeans are set to end the week in the green with the Aussie initially on the back foot following the release of Australian jobs data on Wednesday which initially provided some support for the currency amid an above-forecast employment change and below-forecast unemployment rate, but the AUD fully pared back initial gains as markets digested the full release as jobs growth was mostly fuelled by part-time workers, which coincided with a decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside as some suggest this could push back RBA tightening even further, especially given the decline in house prices, while downbeat mid-week trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross added further fuel to the fire. However, the Aussie has nursed a bulk of losses due to the pullback in the Greenback and is set to end the week just above its open at 0.7164 after having declined to a low of 0.7076. Meanwhile, the Kiwi took advantage of the Aussie demise as the AUD/NZD cross fell to a weekly low 1.0465 (vs. open at 1.0612), and with independent impetus from firm New Zealand inflation data. NZD/USD is set to end the week near the top of the weekly range of 0.6707-6835.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>A firm end of to the week for the Loonie with price action mostly dictated by swings in the energy complex, though the release of disappointing retail sales did dent the CAD to an extent. USD/CAD remained on a downward trajectory on Friday with the aid of a spike in oil prices alongside a pullback in the Buck. The pair fell below its 50 DMA at 1.3350 to a weekly low of 1.3242 (vs. high 1.3375) ahead of the Canadian November GDP release next Thursday alongside comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins later on that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Not the most eventful week for the Yen amidst a constant turnaround in the overall risk tone alongside a choppy Greenback. The week saw the BoJ&rsquo;s first interest rate decision his year in which the Central Bank kept the NIRP at -0.1% and the 10yr JGB yield target around 0%, as expected, while also reducing inflation forecasts, which was widely touted beforehand, while Governor Kuroda struck a dovish tone by stating the CB will not hesitate to ease further if economic conditions deteriorate. Nonetheless, USD/JPY is poised to conclude the week little changed around the middle of a 109.15-99 band. Busy week for Japan coming up as it sees the release of retail sales on Monday, followed by the BoJ Summary of Events on Wednesday, jobs data and comments from Deputy Governor Amamiya on Thursday, and finally the manufacturing PMI on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monday:</strong> BoJ Minutes, Eurozone Consumer Confidence (Final), New Zealand Trade Balance Tuesday: US Consumer Confidence, US Case Shiller, Japan Retail Sales Wednesday: FOMC Interest Rate Decision, Australia CPI, US Pending Home Sales, US-China trade talks Thursday: US PCE (TBC), US Chicago PMI, China PMIs, Eurozone GDP Flash &amp; Unemployment, Canadian PPI, Japan Labour Report, US-China trade talks Friday: EZ (F), UK, US mfg PMIs, US NFP, ISM mfg PMI, Uni.

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: DXY deflates below 96.000 while US shutdown eyes 6th week",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A roller-coaster week for the Buck, but ultimately the index is poised to end Friday&#39;s (EU) session on the backfoot. The week kicked off with MLK day and volatile Dollar trade after the DXY opened around 96.350 in thinned liquidity upon the release of the IMF&rsquo;s global growth forecast downgrade. Trade has been the main factor swinging the Buck this week, as reports of little progress from US-Sino talks sent the DXY to a weekly high of 96.680 (vs. 95.900 low) ahead of the Chinese trade delegation&rsquo;s trip to Washington on Monday, while EUR weakness post-ECB provided the index with extra impetus. However, the Dollar is now weaker again amidst a general improvement in risk sentiment ahead of the FOMC policy meeting next week, with the Board of Governors&rsquo; narrative shifting towards the dovish end of the scale. Next week also sees talks between China Vice Premier Liu He, USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Wednesday, while Thursday is SOMA day in which a drain of 18.2bln in USD liquidity will take place, and finally on Friday markets will see the release of the latest US jobs data which will factor in the furloughed employees from the US government shutdown. ING noted that the 800k workers affected by the shutdown represent only 0.5% of the total NFP tally and added that the impact on the economy will be modest, but noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An impressive recovery in the single currency after plumbing the depths to sub 1.1300 vs. the Dollar, initially triggered by dismal PMI figures from France and the downside exacerbated by the ECB tweaking its balance of risks statement to &ldquo;moved to the downside&rdquo; from &ldquo;moving to the downside&rdquo;. This, alongside mid-week trade-related USD strength sent EUR/USD to a weekly base at 1.1289 (vs. high 1.1410) before rebounding to levels north of 1.1350 on the last trading session of the week. The week also saw the source reports that the European Commission are to cut Italy&rsquo;s GDP forecast to 0.6% or &ldquo;slightly below&rdquo; from the current 1.2%, while the German government cut its domestic 2019 growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.8%. Looking ahead, the coming week sees ECB President Draghi speaking at the European Parliament on Monday, EZ flash GDP on Thursday and flash CPI on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another week of gains for Sterling as ongoing hopes of an Article 50 extension provided stimulus for the via an unwinding of some Brexit risk premium. However, the biggest boost for the Pound came in early Asia trade on Thursday as a Sun article emerged stating that PM May&rsquo;s coalition party, the DUP, is willing to back her Brexit deal if the Premier can get an expiry date to the backstop, though this is widely expected to be rejected by the EU. Nonetheless, the prospect of some sort of unification in the UK government propelled Cable past 1.3100 to the upside to hit a weekly peak (and a 2-month high) at 1.3163 vs. a low of 1.2831. Focus now turns to next Tuesday where Parliament will vote on PM May&rsquo;s Plan B, alongside amendments, which largely aim at delaying Brexit or taking a no-deal scenario off the table (refer to the Week in Focus full details).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodeans are set to end the week in the green with the Aussie initially on the back foot following the release of Australian jobs data on Wednesday which initially provided some support for the currency amid an above-forecast employment change and below-forecast unemployment rate, but the AUD fully pared back initial gains as markets digested the full release as jobs growth was mostly fuelled by part-time workers, which coincided with a decline in participation rates. Additionally, reports of NAB hiking mortgage rates exacerbated downside as some suggest this could push back RBA tightening even further, especially given the decline in house prices, while downbeat mid-week trade comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross added further fuel to the fire. However, the Aussie has nursed a bulk of losses due to the pullback in the Greenback and is set to end the week just above its open at 0.7164 after having declined to a low of 0.7076. Meanwhile, the Kiwi took advantage of the Aussie demise as the AUD/NZD cross fell to a weekly low 1.0465 (vs. open at 1.0612), and with independent impetus from firm New Zealand inflation data. NZD/USD is set to end the week near the top of the weekly range of 0.6707-6835.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firm end of to the week for the Loonie with price action mostly dictated by swings in the energy complex, though the release of disappointing retail sales did dent the CAD to an extent. USD/CAD remained on a downward trajectory on Friday with the aid of a spike in oil prices alongside a pullback in the Buck. The pair fell below its 50 DMA at 1.3350 to a weekly low of 1.3242 (vs. high 1.3375) ahead of the Canadian November GDP release next Thursday alongside comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins later on that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not the most eventful week for the Yen amidst a constant turnaround in the overall risk tone alongside a choppy Greenback. The week saw the BoJ&rsquo;s first interest rate decision his year in which the Central Bank kept the NIRP at -0.1% and the 10yr JGB yield target around 0%, as expected, while also reducing inflation forecasts, which was widely touted beforehand, while Governor Kuroda struck a dovish tone by stating the CB will not hesitate to ease further if economic conditions deteriorate. Nonetheless, USD/JPY is poised to conclude the week little changed around the middle of a 109.15-99 band. Busy week for Japan coming up as it sees the release of retail sales on Monday, followed by the BoJ Summary of Events on Wednesday, jobs data and comments from Deputy Governor Amamiya on Thursday, and finally the manufacturing PMI on Friday.</p>\r\n",

Moreover, reports that the Fed may be contemplating curtailing QT earlier than previously envisaged may be impacting, and could also be dragging the Usd down a bit further as the DXY dips to 96.244, Eur/Usd climbs back above 1.1350 and Cable revisits 1.3100, or thereabouts. This could also challenge some decent expiry options into the NY cut, like 1.5 bn from 1.1350-60 in Eur/Usd.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were buoyed by broad gains across the sectors and with Japanese exporters supported by favourable currency flows, although not all was rosy as healthcare lagged in Australia and steep losses in AMP Capital. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) advanced as the 2nd phase of the PBoC&rsquo;s RRR cut took effect and with outperformance seen in tech names including Tencent after regulators approved 2 of the Co.&rsquo;s mobile phone games. However, gains in the mainland were initially capped after the PBoC&lsquo;s continued inaction resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 770bln, in which it cited high liquidity levels due to the RRR cut. Finally, 10yr JGBs remained close to this week&rsquo;s best levels after the prior day&rsquo;s extended gains and with the BoJ also present in the market for government bonds with 5yr-10yr maturities, although prices have slightly eased with demand for bonds subdued by the risk appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a weekly net drain of CNY 770bln vs. last week&#39;s net injection of CNY 1.16tln, while it commented that the liquidity level in the banking system is relatively high following the 2nd phase of the RRR cut.

However, US House Speaker Pelosi said the idea of including a down payment on wall is a non-starter and Democrats were said to not support any kind of border wall funds which was made clear to McConnell, while Pelosi was later reported to postpone a press conference concerning counter offer to President Trump.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are in the green [Euro Stoxx 50 +1.1%], the FTSE 100 (+0.4%) is the underperforming index given the impact of yesterday&rsquo;s dovish ECB, alongside overnight sterling strength following reports that the DUP may agree to PM may&rsquo;s deal if the Irish backstop has a time limit. The index is also weighed on by poor performance in Vodafone (-2.2%) who missed on their Q3 service revenue. Sectors are in the green, with underperformance in telecom names given the aforementioned earnings from Vodafone. Other notable movers include Telia (-3.3%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. missed on Q4 revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Similarly, Givaudan (-3.3%) are near the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following a miss on Q4 revenue and adjusted EBITA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY- The Dollar and overall index retraced some of yesterday&rsquo;s trade and ECB-induced gains in which DXY reached highs just shy of 96.700. The index fell back below its 50 DMA at 96.549 and through the 96.500 level to currently hover nearer the bottom of a 96.300-530 range, with a 96.680 Fib also keeping the upside capped. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown is set to notch its 35th day after the US Senate blocked two competing proposals (although this was expected) and as a result today&rsquo;s US building permits, durable goods and new home sales data will be postponed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Staging a recovery from post-ECB lows, when EUR/USD briefly lost the 1.1300 handle. Back above the level now, the single currency was largely unreactive to unsurprising narratives from ECB&rsquo;s Coeure and Villeroy, while the release of an overall downbeat German ifo survey and downgrades in the ECB SPF also did little to wobble the Euro. EUR/USD now close to the top of a 1.1300-50 range ahead of a Fib level at 1.1351. In terms of option expiries, the pair sees EUR 1.96bln scattered around 1.1300-25, EUR 1.5bln between 1.1350-60 and EUR 2.8bln between 1.1375-1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; Rising oil prices and an easing buck sent USD/CAD back below its 50 DMA at 1.3350 to an intraday low of 1.3311 ahead of the psychological 1.3300 level with reported bids around the figure. A marginal pullback in energy sent USD/CAD back up to around the middle of a 1.3311-3361 band ahead of the Canadian budget balance release later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash;Tumultuous day for the Pound after a Sun article provided Cable with the fuel to sky rocket past the 1.3100 handle to a high just shy of 1.3140, well above the December low of 1.2477. The article reported that PM&rsquo;s coalition party, the DUP, are willing to back her Brexit deal if the Premier can get an expiry date to the backstop, though is widely expected to be rejected by the EC. Nonetheless, the idea of unity in the government aided the Pound to set fresh yearly highs vs. the buck. However, Cable has pared back most of the overnight gains, albeit holding just above its 200 DMA (1.3055-60) and closer to the bottom of 1.3057-3139 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK &ndash; The marked G10 underperformer amid dismal Swedish retail sales data which dropped the most since 2010 as consumers dialled back on spending due to rising interest rates and falling global markets. This subsequently sent EUR/SEK higher to test 10.3000 at one point, with Informa noting that a spike through key resistance at 10.3400 will spur a further rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Choppy session thus far, but overall back on a decline amid the broad upturn in risk appetite around the market after USD/JPY rose above its 30 DMA at 109.79 to reach intraday highs of 109.91 (vs. low of 109.52) ahead of USD 1.2bln of option expiries at the 110.00 strike for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU and UK fixed income futures remain softer, with UK 10-year futures pivoting the 123.00 handle and languishing near session lows of 122.91. The slightly improved risk tone over night and reports that the DUP have agreed to support PM May&rsquo;s deal (should the backstop be time-limited) has seen 10-year Gilt futures underperform their German counterparts by about 5 ticks heading into the weekend. 10-year Bund futures are trading a shade above session lows of 165.15 and are easing off 2019 pinnacles hit in yesterday&rsquo;s session (165.50) amidst further confirmation of a down turning German economy by the IFO. On a technical standpoint, should 165.18 be broken more convincingly, the 165.01-07 area is next as support. Looking from a flow perspective some price action may be dictated by option expires today in the form in the Gilt, Bund, Bobl, Schatz and T-Note Feb&rsquo;19 contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the periphery, Italian 10-year futures are the EZ outperformer and have found a solid base above the 129.00 handle as market participants point to month-end rebalancing as the driver behind the outperformance in the periphery as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are in the red across the curve with most of the action seen in the shorter end. This comes despite the US Senate rejection of 2 proposals aiming to end the Government shutdown and is likely due to updates from the US administration that they remain optimistic on trade talks and expect the jobs report to be up. This has seen 10-year futures slip just under 121-20 in a data-barren day, with participants looking out for further direction from trade updates and the government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (+0.2%) prices are mixed and off of session highs, just under USD 62/bbl and USD 54/bbl respectively; in spite of yesterday&rsquo;s unexpected EIA crude inventory build of 7.97mln vs. Exp. -0.042mln draw. Elsewhere, Russia was China&rsquo;s largest crude oil supplier for December and 2018; with Russia being the largest crude supplier to China for the third year in a row. Looking ahead we have the Baker Hughes rig count, where last week total rigs decreased by 25 to 1050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is marginally higher on the weakness in dollar, in spite of the positive risk sentiment reducing safe haven demand for the yellow metal. Copper prices are benefiting from market sentiment, whilst palladium has lost over 8% since reaching a high of just under USD 1400/oz last week.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EU and UK fixed income futures remain softer, with UK 10-year futures pivoting the 123.00 handle and languishing near session lows of 122.91. The slightly improved risk tone over night and reports that the DUP have agreed to support PM May&rsquo;s deal (should the backstop be time-limited) has seen 10-year Gilt futures underperform their German counterparts by about 5 ticks heading into the weekend. 10-year Bund futures are trading a shade above session lows of 165.15 and are easing off 2019 pinnacles hit in yesterday&rsquo;s session (165.50) amidst further confirmation of a down turning German economy by the IFO. On a technical standpoint, should 165.18 be broken more convincingly, the 165.01-07 area is next as support. Looking from a flow perspective some price action may be dictated by option expires today in the form in the Gilt, Bund, Bobl, Schatz and T-Note Feb&rsquo;19 contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the periphery, Italian 10-year futures are the EZ outperformer and have found a solid base above the 129.00 handle ahead of the upcoming CTZ auction as market participants point to month-end rebalancing as the driver behind the outperformance in the periphery as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are in the red across the curve with most of the action seen in the shorter end. This comes despite the US Senate rejection of 2 proposals aiming to end the Government shutdown and is likely due to updates from the US administration that they remain optimistic on trade talks and expect the jobs report to be up. This has seen 10-year futures slip just under 121-20 in a data-barren day, with participants looking out for further direction from trade updates and the government shutdown.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) were buoyed by broad gains across the sectors and with Japanese exporters supported by favourable currency flows, although not all was rosy as healthcare lagged in Australia and steep losses in AMP Capital. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) advanced as the 2nd phase of the PBoC&rsquo;s RRR cut took effect and with outperformance seen in tech names including Tencent after regulators approved 2 of the Co.&rsquo;s mobile phone games. However, gains in the mainland were initially capped after the PBoC&lsquo;s continued inaction resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 770bln, in which it cited high liquidity levels due to the RRR cut. Finally, 10yr JGBs remained close to this week&rsquo;s best levels after the prior day&rsquo;s extended gains and with the BoJ also present in the market for government bonds with 5yr-10yr maturities, although prices have slightly eased with demand for bonds subdued by the risk appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a weekly net drain of CNY 770bln vs. last week&#39;s net injection of CNY 1.16tln, while it commented that the liquidity level in the banking system is relatively high following the 2nd phase of the RRR cut. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7941 (Prev. 6.7802)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Tokyo CPI (Jan) Y/Y 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.3%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Tokyo CPI Ex.

(The Sun) Furthermore, Sun Political Editor Dunn tweeted that former UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is close to supporting PM May&#39;s deal with a backstop time limit following discussions with the chief whip on Wednesday. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some EU countries are reportedly pushing for the EU to provide a more generous stance to the UK in the event of a no deal, with some countries wanting UK hauliers to be given the right to operate within EU and some also want British airliners to be able to offer connecting flights within EU. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Queen has urged the country to &ldquo;seek out the common ground&rdquo; in a sign of royal nervousness over the divisions caused by Brexit. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is facing an open cabinet revolt over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit after two ministers said yesterday they could step down rather than let Britain crash out of the EU. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Treasury reportedly ruled out online tax to support high street shops as it would breach EU rules. (The Times)<br /><br />Irish central bank said a disorderly Brexit could reduce the Irish economic growth rate by as much as 4ppts in first full year and could weaken growth this year to 1.5%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German government cut 2019 GDP growth forecast to 1.0% (Prev. 1.8%). (Handelsblatt) Note, the European Commission currently hold a 1.8% forecast for 2019 German GDP growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly pulled-back to below the 96.50 level, but still held on to the majority of the prior day&rsquo;s gains as EUR/USD languished in the wake of soft EU PMI data and dovish ECB comments. GBP/USD was underpinned by reports the DUP are said to have privately agreed they will back PM May&rsquo;s deal with a backstop as long as its specifically time limited, which helped the pair reclaim the 1.3100 handle as it sets its sights for its biggest weekly gain in more than a year. Elsewhere, the positive risk sentiment coupled with CNY strength provided some respite from the recent selling across antipodeans, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses also recovered lost ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded higher as the heightened risk appetite provided a catalyst for overnight trade in the complex which saw WTI crude and Brent crude futures gains over 1% each towards the USD 54.00/bbl and USD 62.00/bbl level respectively. Elsewhere, the risk sentiment also underpinned copper throughout the session, while gold was only marginally higher as support from the mild softness in the greenback was counterbalanced by a lack of safe haven demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US State Department ordered non-emergency US government employees to leave Venezuela for security reasons, while there were also comments from US National Security Adviser Bolton that the Trump administration is focused on cutting off Venezuela&#39;s Maduro from revenue sources and that he doesn&#39;t think Maduro has backing of the military. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renewed demand for the safe haven sent treasuries higher on Thursday amid a mix of factors including a dovish ECB, Ross cautious comments on US and China trade talks as well as Germany&rsquo;s downgrade to its 2019 growth forecasts. Solid PMI data took the complex off highs but were not enough for a change of direction. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed close to the unchanged mark. US T-note futures (H9) settled 11+ ticks higher at 121-24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate blocked 2 competing proposals to end the government shutdown including one backed by US President Trump as expected, while reports then noted that a bipartisan plan to open government for 3 weeks will be offered. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he wants a prorated down payment on the wall in any short-term government funding bill and that if Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer can reach an agreement on government funding, he would support it. However, US House Speaker Pelosi said the idea of including a down payment on wall is a non-starter and Democrats were said to not support any kind of border wall funds which was made clear to McConnell, while Pelosi was later reported to postpone a press conference concerning counter offer to President Trump. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said US President Trump is doing everything he can to reach a compromise on the border wall and commented that both US and China want to make a trade deal, while White House Economic Advisor Kudlow said he thinks President Trump is rather optimistic on US-China trade talks and that the jobs report for January will be up.

        "content": "<p>A jubilant tone is observed across the Asia-Pac majors heading into the weekend, which follows the mostly positive performance of their global peers amid firmer US PMI data and a dovish tone from the ECB. As such, ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were buoyed by broad gains seen across the sectors and with Japanese exporters supported as USD/JPY and JPY-crosses attempt a rebound, although not all is rosy with healthcare lagging in Australia and steep losses seen in AMP Capital after it flagged a 92% decline in FY net profit attributable to shareholders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are also positive as the 2nd phase of the PBoC&rsquo;s RRR cut takes effect and with outperformance seen in tech names including Tencent after regulators approved 2 of the Co.&rsquo;s mobile phone games. However, gains in the mainland are capped after the PBoC&lsquo;s continued inaction resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 770bln, in which it cited high liquidity levels due to the RRR cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly pulled-back to the 96.50 level, but still holds on to the majority of the prior day&rsquo;s gains as EUR/USD languishes in the wake of soft EU PMI data and dovish ECB comments. Conversely, GBP/USD was underpinned by reports the DUP are said to have privately agreed they will back PM May&rsquo;s deal with a backstop as long as its specifically time limited, with the pair now at the 1.3100 handle and on course for its biggest weekly gain in more than a year. Elsewhere, the positive risk sentiment has provided mild respite from the recent selling across antipodeans, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses also attempt to recover some lost ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs eased slightly overnight with demand for bonds subdued amid the heightened risk appetite, although prices remain close to this week&rsquo;s best levels after the prior day&rsquo;s extended gains and with the BoJ also present in the market for government bonds with 5yr-10yr maturities</p>\r\n",
