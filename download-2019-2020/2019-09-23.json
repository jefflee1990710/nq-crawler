The NY Times explains China's cancelled visits to US farms out of concern that it would turn into a media circus and give the misimpression that China was trying to meddle in American domestic politics, rather than a result of trade negotiations. Meanwhile, US President Trump said that he was seeking a 'complete' trade deal, and that China just buying US agriculture was not enough, and again stated that he did not think that a trade deal was needed before the 2020 elections.</p><p><strong>* TRADE COMMENT: </strong>The latest talks have provided no indication that progress has been made on the core issues (of IP theft, forced technology transfers, subsidies for state firms, for instance). There, of course, has been some goodwill gestures (US suspending tariff implementation on PRC 70th anniversary, China upping purchases of some US agriculture; some also point to Trump suspending tariffs on some goods that will have affected US consumers over the holiday season, though this seems more a cynical attempt to prevent self-harm, analysts have said), which are a positive, and President Trump will probably wave trade deals with Japan and India this week, with possible signals of a quick trade deal between the US/UK; but the market wants to see progress on US/China front, and on US/Europe (autos particularly) before it can begin to discount higher SPX multiples, brokers have said.</p><p><strong>* US MARKIT PMI FLASH:</strong> Markit's flash September PMI surveys for the US surprised to the upside, with the manufacturing print rising to 51.0, against an expectation for an unchanged 50.3; the services gauge softened, against an expectation it would rise (50.9 against an expected 51.5). Markit explained the recent deterioration has been a further spill-over of the trade-led slowdown in manufacturing to the service sector. The survey indicates that businesses continue to struggle against the headwinds of trade worries and elevated uncertainty about the outlook, Markit said, noting that although picking up slightly, the overall rate of growth in September remained among the weakest since 2016, commensurate with GDP rising in Q3 at a subdued annualized rate of approximately&nbsp; 1.5%, while also warning that, at current levels, the employment index was indicative of non-farm payroll growth falling below 100,000. Meanwhile, Markit said that price pressures have meanwhile also eased, with both input costs and average selling prices for goods and services dropping again in September, painting a picture of the weakest corporate inflationary pressures for a decade.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE ADVANCED SEPTEMBER PMI:</strong> The composite fell to 50.4, against expectations for an unchanged reading of 51.9; the manufacturing print fell to 45.6 from 47.0, while the services PMI fell from 53.5 to 52. Markit said that a key development in recent months has been the broadening out of the deterioration beyond manufacturing. Pantheon Macroeconomics, however, said the services PMI through Q3 as a whole was 52.9, a trivial 0.2ppts lower versus Q2 2019, and still above the average for Q4 2018 and Q1 2019; \"We concede that today’s data add fuel to the idea that a recession in manufacturing is now about to drag the economy as a whole down, but we need a bit more evidence to make this our base case,\" the consultancy said, \"meanwhile for markets, the key story also is that policymakers are much more likely to respond with force, both fiscal and monetary, than to sit idle. How effective this 'put' is very difficult to say, but it’s there.\"</p><p><strong>* GERMANY ADVANCED SEPTEMBER PMI:</strong> The composite PMI fell beneath 50, and into contraction territory (49.1 vs an expected 51.5 from 51.7). The manufacturing gauge fell further, to 41.4 from 43.5; the services component weakened to 52.5 from 54.8. Analysts said the data provided further signs that Germany is facing a technical recession in Q3, after the GDP contraction in Q2, as global trade conflicts and the stand-off between the EU and US weighs.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE INFLATION EXPECTATION SLIDE:</strong> Following the release of the advance September PMI data, long-term Eurozone inflation expectations fell to 1.2258%, to levels seen just before the ECB's September policy meeting.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed’s 50bp dissenter, <strong>Bullard</strong> said the rate cuts by the Fed should help to lift inflation back to its 2% target, but the “jury is still out” and that he thinks the bank will miss its 2% target this year and next (on Friday, he put one of his causes for dissent as Core and headline PCE running between 40 and 60 bps beneath target). On further rate cuts, Bullard said the decisions will be made meeting by meeting and that he was unclear whether other colleagues will support more rate cuts; the latest dot plots showed 7/17 members forecasting one further cut this year, Bullard being one of them. Bullard noted that the shift in the Fed’s tone has made policy more accommodative and that he is not currently seeing an intensification of yield curve inversion, likely because the market sees further rate cuts; Bullard adds, the dissenters reflect the high level of uncertainty at the Fed on how to assess the economy. On the repo-operation, Bullard feels the Fed reacted appropriately, medium term solution to trouble in the repo-market would be a new permanent facility at the fed. When asked about potential expansion of balance sheet to avoid further operations, says “it is not completely clear that volatility was a result of a shortage in the reserves system”. NY Fed President <strong>Williams</strong> spoke on the operations, saying the actions have seen the desired effect of reducing strains in the market; today’s operation was under subscribed (65.75bln accepted / USD 75bln offered), suggesting the liquidity drought in the repo market is potentially subsiding. Williams mentioned the operations are intended to keep EFFR in its target range and that the NY bank was prepared for the liquidity issues and acted quickly and appropriately. Williams also urged on changing LIBOR, saying the deadline for LIBOR is fast approaching and has urged financial firms to act, warning that if participants continue to structure products off of LIBOR thinking the Fed will delay its planned removal of the rate, they are mistaken.</p><p><strong>* ECB’S DRAGHI’S (FINAL) TESTIMONY: </strong>Mainly reiterated<strong> </strong>the remarks made at his presser on September 12th, that EZ growth momentum has slowed markedly and more than had previously been anticipated. Draghi said the longer the weakness in manufacturing persists, the greater the risks that other sectors of the economy will be affected by the slowdown; comments made just a few hours after the further decline in the EZ Markit PMIs (flash), which saw both services and manufacturing miss expectations. Draghi noted that recent data and forward-looking data, such as new export orders in manufacturing, don’t show convincing signs of a rebound in growth soon and the balance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside. Draghi took time to highlight that market expectations of inflation over the medium-term were inconsistent with the ECB’s target.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The UK Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the Government's prorogation of Parliament is set to be announced on Tuesday at 10:30 BST; Foreign Secretary Raab has indicated that the government would abide by the ruling, but has not ruled-out the possibility of Parliament being prorogued again.</p><p><strong>* UK/US TRADE:</strong> UK PM Johnson and US President Trump agree to strike UK/US trade deal by July 2020, with the two possibly publicly committing to the timeframe on Tuesday at the UN meetings in NY. The speed is likely to be influenced by the high risk of the US presidential election in November, where it may be harder for the UK to strike a deal under a Democrat administration, who have not expressed similar enthusiasm as Trump to strike a deal.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.55 HIGHER AT USD 58.64/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLED USD 0.49 HIGHER AT USD 64.77/BBL:</strong> Crude reversed gains on Monday, as demand concerns re-surface after grim Eurozone flash PMI data for September raise the odds of a recession in Germany, stemming from the oil intensive manufacturing sector. Russian Energy Minister Novak affirmed that Russia will be cutting September’s oil output to ensure OPEC+ compliance, although this had little sway on Brent given Russia is already compliant, despite a marginal increase in August production. While Saudi officials have been guiding the market towards full normalisation of oil production by the end of the month (sources said on Monday that Khurais and Abqaiq could be restored to full production as soon as next week), contractors and insiders have reportedly suggested that repairing the Abqaiq plant might take months, which analysts say would likely put some upside into crude prices, particularly given that we are around 7% off the highs seen last week in wake of the recent attacks. The Saudis have been keen to reiterate that no customer shipments have yet been missed. Elevated risk in the region is also contributing to higher crude prices on Monday, analysts said. ING has said that the approximately USD 5/bbl risk premium that the market is pricing in seems fair, assuming we do see a return to pre-attack levels before the end of this month, adding that the global oil balance continues to tighten, which should offer further support to prices in the coming months. But ING does warn, however, that any strength will likely be short-lived, given that the supply outlook over 2020 continuing to look bearish. The latest US energy inventory expectations see crude stocks -0.8mln bbls, distillates -1.3mln bbls, gasoline +0.03mln bbls; Genscape’s flyover sees Cushing stocks +2.8mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SAUDI-IRAN: </strong>US President Trump has said that he has no plans to meet his Iranian counterpart Rouhani on the side-lines of the UN General Assembly, this week. Trump was keen to reiterate that he was flexible on talks. US Envoy for Iran Brian Hook later said the US is seeking comprehensive negotiations with Iran that include discussions on missile development and terrorism. Iran has previously ruled that talks could not take place without the lifting of sanctions, and the US returning to the 2015 JCPOA, as well as a USD 15bln credit line.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY: </strong>The US will sell USD 40bln of new 2-year notes (Tue), USD 41bln of new 5-year notes (Wed), and USD 32bln of new 7-year notes; desks note there will be around USD 89bln of cash in the week, including USD 80bln of redemptions, and USD 9bln of coupons; this week, the Fed will buy USD 1.625bln in the 2-3 year sector (Thu), and USD 2.23bln on 3-5 year sector (Fri). Analysts at BMO said the latest yield move back from the bullish extremes should serve as at least a decent concession on an outright basis for all three auctions, though the persistent flatness of the curve leaves relative value asymmetrically benefitting shorter dated Treasuries.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 12+ TICKS HIGHER AT 130-02+. </strong>The dismal EZ PMIs saw a flight into Treasuries and EGBs as hopes of a trough in the manufacturing sector were dissipated, where the decline begun to show it was feeding through into the services component. The mixed US PMIs failed to change the dial, however, going into the tail-end of the session yields did come off their lows and settled not far over 1bps lower across the curve.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0% at 2992, NASDAQ-100 -0.1% at 7819, Dow Jones 0.1% at 26950</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, Consumer Staples 0.4%, Energy 0.1%, Financials 0.2%, Health Care -0.6%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology 0.2%, Materials -0.3%, Telecommunication Services -0.4%, Utilities 0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) traded higher as it received 10/15 tariff exemption requests on its Macbook Pro parts, Varian Medical Sciences (VAR) also received some tariff exemptions on its China produced radiotherapy components. Following positive China trade updates which put to sleep worries about the early Friday departure from the Chinese agriculture secretary, SOX traded higher however UBS note that despite the South Korean semiconductor exports falling drastically (-40% y/y), it was largely due to base effects and to stockpiling last year ahead of US-China trade worries and a public holiday. Boeing (BA) traded in the red as participants await an announcement from the US FAA regarding the progress of the 737-MAX jets, as many international aviator bodies are divided about the return of the jet. BA also have had to cover the costs induced by Icelandair for the grounding of their 737 MAX fleet, which consists of 6 jets, as part of an agreement. Sources also stated that BA’s acquisition of Embraer’s (ERJ) commercial airline business is subject to a full-scale EU antitrust investigation. American Express (AXP) caught a bid in the later session after announcing it is to repurchase up to 120mln shares (equates to 14.5% of the float) and an increase of its dividend. Facebook (FB) received some support for it’s Libra, from IBM (IBM), who are looking to collaborate with FB on digital currencies. According to FT, citing people familiar with the matter, AT&amp;T(T) are facing further activist pressure from Elliott Management to divest some of its core assets, adding everything is potentially up for sale, including HBO. Equniix (EQIX) gained as it hired Uber’s (UBER) Head of Global Network and Software Platform as its CTO. Aptiv (APTIV) were higher following the announcement of an autonomous vehicle joint venture with Hyundai where both will hold a 50% stake in a JV valued at roughly USD 4bln. Materials were under pressure to start the week following a slew of metal name downgrades at JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, with JPM double downgrading US Steel (X) following last week’s profit warning linked to a weakening global demand outlook.</p><p><strong>* FX: USD</strong> higher today back above 98.50 heading towards the 99.00 handle, seeing a 98.84 high. The strength was driven by a weaker <strong>EUR</strong> following poor Eurozone PMI data sparking further worries about a potential EU recession. Initial DXY strength pared back slightly throughout the remainder of the session but still remained above 98.50 heading into Asia-Pac trade. ECB President Draghi added little new to the ECB statement, failing to add any direction to the single currency which now resides beneath the key 1.10 handle. <strong>GBP</strong> on the backfoot today trading relatively sideways with no new catalyst for the Pound as markets await tomorrow’s prorogation vote. Havens slightly firmer today, <strong>XAU</strong> remaining at highs despite a stronger buck, <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> also firmer following poor EZ PMI’s. <strong>NZD</strong> outperformed today ahead of RBNZ later in the week and trade data tonight, <strong>AUDUSD</strong> traded flat heading into the Asia session despite poor Australian PMI figures, however the initial losses were pared back, likely on further trade optimism. EM’s were mixed with <strong>BRL</strong> weaker following a larger deficit in its current account. <strong>MXN</strong> was also weaker despite strong retail sales as participants await Thursday’s Banxico rate decision, where 14/16 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect a 25bp cut, and the remaining two expecting a 50bp cut. <strong>ZAR</strong> was firmer against the buck trading in a range between 14.9634 -14.8400.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude traded choppy on Monday, as demand concerns re-surface after grim Eurozone flash PMI data for September raise the odds of a recession in Germany, stemming from the oil intensive manufacturing sector. Russian Energy Minister Novak affirmed that Russia will be cutting September’s oil output to ensure OPEC+ compliance, although this had little sway on Brent given Russia is already compliant, despite a marginal increase in August production. While Saudi officials have been guiding the market towards full normalisation of oil production by the end of the month (sources said on Monday that Khurais and Abqaiq could be restored to full production as soon as next week), contractors and insiders have reportedly suggested that repairing the Abqaiq plant might take months, which analysts say would likely put some upside into crude prices, particularly given that we are around 7% off the highs seen last week in wake of the recent attacks. The Saudis have been keen to reiterate that no customer shipments have yet been missed. Elevated risk in the region is also contributing to higher crude prices on Monday, analysts said. ING has said that the approximately USD 5/bbl risk premium that the market is pricing in seems fair, assuming we do see a return to pre-attack levels before the end of this month, adding that the global oil balance continues to tighten, which should offer further support to prices in the coming months. But ING does warn, however, that any strength will likely be short-lived, given that the supply outlook over 2020 continuing to look bearish. The latest US energy inventory expectations see crude stocks -0.8mln bbls, distillates -1.3mln bbls, gasoline +0.03mln bbls; Genscape’s flyover sees Cushing stocks +2.8mln bbls.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>Major European bourses are lower (Euro Stoxx 50 -1.0%), after disappointing PMI data stoked further concerns about the slowdown in Eurozone growth. The DAX (-1.2%) is the notable underperformer, slipping briefly below last week’s low and recent support at 12300, after German manufacturing PMI data pointed to the sector falling further into contractionary territory. Amid the risk off sentiment, utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and health care (unch.) sectors are supported, while materials (-1.6%), financials (-1.7%) and tech (-1.4%) are softer. Bucking the general risk tone are European airlines, including TUI (+7.5%), Ryanair (+1.1%) and easyJet (+3.5%), who are higher after rival Thomas Cook ceased trading activities and filed for bankruptcy. In terms of individual movers; William Hill (-4.0%) reversed early gains, despite premarket news that the Co. is looking for US broadcaster deals in an attempt to promote its brand. Elsewhere, K+S (-5.7%) sunk after being downgraded at Pareto Securities. Ocado (+0.2%) managed to reverse losses on triggered by news that the Co’s Chairman stated they “will go to any length” to protect their intellectual property, amid a court battle with a co-founder. Finally, ABN AMRO (-3.5%) is under pressure after being downgraded at Santander.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>EUR, USD -</strong> Further concerns about the European economy have weighed on the Euro in early trade as the latest flash PMIs out of the region deteriorated significantly vs. expectations. Germany’s release took EUR/USD below the 1.100 level with IHS noting that on its current trajectory, Germany may not see any growth before year-end, whilst VDMA added further pessimism to the German economic outlook. Further, the EZ release did little to immediately sway asset classes as participants anticipated a softer pan-release, but IHS highlighted that Q3 EZ GDP growth looks set to rise just 0.1%. Analysts at CapEco highlighted concerns regarding manufacturing contagion on the services sector whilst noting that a continuation in the employment component could lead to further easing in wages. Thus, the analysts believe that \"there is little reason to think that GDP growth will pick up as the ECB and the consensus forecasts assume\". EUR/USD took out Friday’s low and a Fib level around 1.0995-97 to print a base at 1.0967 ahead of support at 1.0966 and 1.0950 (YTD low at 1.0924). Next up, participants will be eyeing ECB President Draghi’s final testimony to the European Parliament at 1400BST. Meanwhile, the Buck has derived support in light of a weaker Single Currency as DXY extends its gains above 98.50 to a high of 98.84 and ahead of the psychological 99.00 and resistance at 99.10. On the docket State-side, traders will be on the lookout for a few Fed speaks including Williams (voter, neutral) at the US Treasury Market Conference at 1450BST, Bullard (voter, dove, dissenter) on monetary policy at 1800BST and Daly (non-voter, neutral) on supporting US economy in urban &amp; rural communities.</p><p><strong>GBP, CAD -</strong> Weaker on the day, albeit more on the back of a firmer USD with Brexit-watchers still on the lookout for the Supreme Court’s decision on PM Johnson’s parliament prorogation. If ruled against (as legal experts expect), then the PM could be forced to recall MPs back to parliament. Cable remains marginally softer below the 1.2450 level (vs. high of 1.2490) after finding a base at 1.2424, which marks the lowest since 17th September (although that day saw a low of 1.2393). The Loonie also takes a spot as a G10 laggard, but mostly pressured by a retreat in oil prices as the post-PMI sentiment seeped into the energy complex. USD/CAD hovers around the 1.3300 handle (vs. low of 1.3257) with resistance seen to the upside at 1.3305 (200 DMA), 1.3346 and the psychological 1.3350 levels.</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY -</strong> Marginally firmer amid a weakening EUR and flights to safety post-EZ PMI with USD/JPY back below the 107.50 level to a low of 107.30 ahead of support at 107.10, whilst EUR/CHF trades flat on the day but fell from an intra-day high of 1.0930 (50 DMA) to a base just above 1.0850 (with support and YTD low at 1.0809). Attention remains on the 1.08 level amid the recent rise in SNB total sights deposits with TD noting that the data suggests the SNB may be defending the level.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong> - The antipodeans remain above water with the Kiwi outperforming its Tasman-peer ahead of this week’s RBNZ Monetary Policy Decision amid consensus for an unchanged Cash Rate at 1.00%, following its unexpected rate cut at its prior meeting, whilst the Shadow Board also recommends no change in policy. The currencies seem to have also derived some support from the US-China trade saga with Chinese state media noting that talks are constructive, and that the cancelled China visit to US farms was not a sign of deteriorating talks. NZD/USD hovers near intra-day highs (0.6277) after finding a base at 0.6250 whilst its Aussie counterpart remains above 0.6750, albeit off highs (0.6780).</p><p>Israel Joint List party are to back center-left’s Benny Gantz to form a new government. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>An upbeat start to the week for the debt complex, with Bunds leading the charge having touched a high of 174.52 at best thus far equating to over a full point in upside, in wake of an abysmal slate of PMIs out of Europe. The bulk of the price action occurred on the poor German prints, which saw Manufacturing drop further into contractionary territory, Composite move under the 50 mark and services ever closer to this figure at 52.5. As is typical there was fairly limited reaction to the EZ wide metric as price action had already moved in anticipation of a softer flash prints. Moving to Gilts which are bid in sympathy with their EZ counterparts firmly above Friday’s high of 132.81 having reached 132.55 at best; price action for Gilts may derive some impetus from BoE’s Tenreyro speaking on Inflation but given the BoE’s hands remain tied until the conclusion of Brexit this may not be too instrumental. Moving across the pond to USTs which are also bid following European price action, a very quiet data slate ahead with only Flash PMIs of note (manufacturing Exp. in-line at 50.3; services firmer than Prev. at 51.5) similarly to the UK focus turns to Central Bank speak with Fed’s Williams and Bullard the highlights; prior to this, USTs currently just off of session highs at 130.08+ (+16 ticks).</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Oil prices continued to come off its earlier highs, as focus shifted from the prospect of a more protracted disruption to Saudi Aramco supply than expected (which helped prices over the weekend) to concern over global growth, after more abysmal Eurozone PMI data triggered a bout of selling in the complex. Downside was exacerbated soon thereafter on source reports that Saudi Arabia's Khuraris and Abqaiaq facilities are to fully restore oil production early next week (form current production levels of around 4.3mln BPD), contrary to WSJ reports over the weekend that repairs could take up to 8 months. <strong>WTI Nov’ 19 </strong>futures slumped through last week’s lows around the USD 58/bbl handle, before finding a base at USD 57.40/bbl, while<strong> Brent Nov’ 19</strong> fell below the USD 64/bbl handle, although last week’s USD 63.06 low is still some way off. <strong>Gold </strong>prices are higher, despite opening on the back foot (on weekend reports that Chinese agriculture officials didn’t end their US trip early due to trade talk difficulties) and a firmer buck, with negative risk sentiment exacerbated by the aforementioned Eurozone PMIs helping to lift the precious metal; spot gold continues to climb from its recent USD 1500/oz base. On the flip side, global demand concerns are keeping <strong>copper</strong> prices under pressure.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia's Khuraris and Abqaiaq facilities are to fully restore oil production early next week; currently producing around 4.3mln BPD</strong>., according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>Aramco is in emergency discussions with contractors and are offering premium rates for parts and repair work in an effort to resume output quickly amid concerns repairs may last many months instead of the maximum 10 weeks that was promised. Some ARAMCO board members were said to be horrified Co. communicated such optimistic assessments <strong>on returning output to normal, while technical experts shared the view with some Saudi officials that it could take 8 months</strong>. (WSJ/Newswires)</p><p>Saudi Aramco notified Japan's top oil distributor JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy regarding a potential change in shipments in which it wants to change the oil grade it supplies from light to heavy and medium beginning next month which reports suggest indicates ARAMCO is having a hard time restoring its production as quickly as it has promised.

The DAX (-1.2%) is the notable underperformer, slipping briefly below last week’s low and recent support at 12300, after German manufacturing PMI data pointed to the sector falling further into contractionary territory. Amid the risk off sentiment, utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and health care (unch.) sectors are supported, while materials (-1.6%), financials (-1.7%) and tech (-1.4%) are softer. Bucking the general risk tone are European airlines, including TUI (+7.5%), Ryanair (+1.1%) and easyJet (+3.5%), who are higher after rival Thomas Cook ceased trading activities and filed for bankruptcy. In terms of individual movers; William Hill (-4.0%) reversed early gains, despite premarket news that the Co. is looking for US broadcaster deals in an attempt to promote its brand. Elsewhere, K+S (-5.7%) sunk after being downgraded at Pareto Securities. Ocado (+0.2%) managed to reverse losses on triggered by news that the Co’s Chairman stated they “will go to any length” to protect their intellectual property, amid a court battle with a co-founder. Finally, ABN AMRO (-3.5%) is under pressure after being downgraded at Santander.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR, USD</strong></p><p>Further concerns about the European economy have weighed on the Euro in early trade as the latest flash PMIs out of the region deteriorated significantly vs. expectations. Germany’s release took EUR/USD below the 1.100 level with IHS noting that on its current trajectory, Germany may not see any growth before year-end, whilst VDMA added further pessimism to the German economic outlook. Further, the EZ release did little to immediately sway asset classes as participants anticipated a softer pan-release, but IHS highlighted that Q3 EZ GDP growth looks set to rise just 0.1%. Analysts at CapEco highlighted concerns regarding manufacturing contagion on the services sector whilst noting that a continuation in the employment component could lead to further easing in wages. Thus, the analysts believe that \"there is little reason to think that GDP growth will pick up as the ECB and the consensus forecasts assume\". EUR/USD took out Friday’s low and a Fib level around 1.0995-97 to print a base at 1.0967 ahead of support at 1.0966 and 1.0950 (YTD low at 1.0924). Next up, participants will be eyeing ECB President Draghi’s final testimony to the European Parliament at 1400BST. Meanwhile, the Buck has derived support in light of a weaker Single Currency as DXY extends its gains above 98.50 to a high of 98.84 and ahead of the psychological 99.00 and resistance at 99.10. On the docket State-side, traders will be on the lookout for a few Fed speaks including Williams (voter, neutral) at the US Treasury Market Conference at 1450BST, Bullard (voter, dove, dissenter) on monetary policy at 1800BST and Daly (non-voter, neutral) on supporting US economy in urban &amp; rural communities.</p><p><strong>GBP, CAD</strong></p><p>Weaker on the day, albeit more on the back of a firmer USD with Brexit-watchers still on the lookout for the Supreme Court’s decision on PM Johnson’s parliament prorogation. If ruled against (as legal experts expect), then the PM could be forced to recall MPs back to parliament. Cable remains marginally softer below the 1.2450 level (vs. high of 1.2490) after finding a base at 1.2424, which marks the lowest since 17th September (although that day saw a low of 1.2393). The Loonie also takes a spot as a G10 laggard, but mostly pressured by a retreat in oil prices as the post-PMI sentiment seeped into the energy complex. USD/CAD hovers around the 1.3300 handle (vs. low of 1.3257) with resistance seen to the upside at 1.3305 (200 DMA), 1.3346 and the psychological 1.3350 levels.</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong></p><p>Marginally firmer amid a weakening EUR and flights to safety post-EZ PMI with USD/JPY back below the 107.50 level to a low of 107.30 ahead of support at 107.10, whilst EUR/CHF trades flat on the day but fell from an intra-day high of 1.0930 (50 DMA) to a base just above 1.0850 (with support and YTD low at 1.0809). Attention remains on the 1.08 level amid the recent rise in SNB total sights deposits with TD noting that the data suggests the SNB may be defending the level.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The antipodeans remain above water with the Kiwi outperforming its Tasman-peer ahead of this week’s RBNZ Monetary Policy Decision amid consensus for an unchanged Cash Rate at 1.00%, following its unexpected rate cut at its prior meeting, whilst the Shadow Board also recommends no change in policy. The currencies seem to have also derived some support from the US-China trade saga with Chinese state media noting that talks are constructive, and that the cancelled China visit to US farms was not a sign of deteriorating talks. NZD/USD hovers near intra-day highs (0.6277) after finding a base at 0.6250 whilst its Aussie counterpart remains above 0.6750, albeit off highs (0.6780).</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>An upbeat start to the week for the debt complex, with <strong>Bunds</strong> leading the charge having touched a high of 174.52 at best thus far equating to over a full point in upside, in wake of an abysmal slate of PMIs out of Europe. The bulk of the price action occurred on the poor German prints, which saw Manufacturing drop further into contractionary territory, Composite move under the 50 mark and services ever closer to this figure at 52.5. As is typical there was fairly limited reaction to the EZ wide metric as price action had already moved in anticipation of a softer flash prints. Moving to <strong>Gilts</strong> which are bid in sympathy with their EZ counterparts firmly above Friday’s high of 132.81 having reached 132.55 at best; price action for Gilts may derive some impetus from BoE’s Tenreyro speaking on Inflation but given the BoE’s hands remain tied until the conclusion of Brexit this may not be too instrumental. Moving across the pond to USTs which are also bid following European price action, a very quiet data slate ahead with only Flash PMIs of note (manufacturing Exp. in-line at 50.3; services firmer than Prev. at 51.5) similarly to the UK focus turns to Central Bank speak with Fed’s Williams and Bullard the highlights; prior to this, <strong>USTs</strong> currently just off of session highs at 130.08+ (+16 ticks).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Oil prices continued to come off its earlier highs, as focus shifted from the prospect of a more protracted disruption to Saudi Aramco supply than expected (which helped prices over the weekend) to concern over global growth, after more abysmal Eurozone PMI data triggered a bout of selling in the complex. Downside was exacerbated soon thereafter on source reports that Saudi Arabia's Khuraris and Abqaiaq facilities are to fully restore oil production early next week (form current production levels of around 4.3mln BPD), contrary to WSJ reports over the weekend that repairs could take up to 8 months. <strong>WTI</strong> Nov’ 19 futures slumped through last week’s lows around the USD 58/bbl handle, before finding a base at USD 57.40/bbl, while <strong>Brent</strong> Nov’ 19 fell below the USD 64/bbl handle, although last week’s USD 63.06 low is still some way off. <strong>Gold</strong> prices are higher, despite opening on the back foot (on weekend reports that Chinese agriculture officials didn’t end their US trip early due to trade talk difficulties) and a firmer buck, with negative risk sentiment exacerbated by the aforementioned Eurozone PMIs helping to lift the precious metal; spot gold continues to climb from its recent USD 1500/oz base. On the flip side, global demand concerns are keeping copper prices under pressure.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) was positive with the index led higher by the commodity related stocks after gold advanced above the USD 1500/oz level and with oil underpinned by reports it could take 8 months for Saudi output to return to normal, while India’s NIFTY (+2.2%) outperformed again after the recent corporate tax cut announcement. Conversely, weakness in Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) dampened sentiment in the region with underperformance in the mainland as ongoing trade uncertainty overshadowed the liquidity efforts by the PBoC. This followed conflicting reports in which US President Trump stated Chinese agricultural purchases will not be enough and reiterated that he does not need a deal before the 2020 election although it was also reported the US granted temporary tariff exemptions on over 400 types of Chinese products, while China’s delegation cancelled its US farm visit but this was later attributed to concerns it could turn into a media circus or may be misconceived as meddling and was not due to a breakdown in trade talks.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>LSE (LSE LN)</strong> – Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has reportedly asked HSBC (HSBA LN) and UBS (UBSG SW) to help it charm LSE shareholders after the GBP 32bln takeover approach by HKEX was rejected by the LSE board.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed following the negative close last Friday on Wall St. amid the temperamental US-China trade headlines, while the absence of Japanese markets also contributes to the lacklustre tone. ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with the index led higher by the commodity related stocks after gold advanced above the USD1500/oz level and with oil underpinned by reports it could take 8 months for Saudi output to return to normal. Conversely, weakness in Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) dampened sentiment in the region with underperformance in the mainland as ongoing trade uncertainty overshadows the liquidity efforts by the PBoC. This follows conflicting reports as US President Trump stated Chinese agricultural purchases will not be enough and reiterated that he does not need a deal before the 2020 election although it was also reported the US granted temporary tariff exemptions on over 400 types of Chinese products, while China’s delegation cancelled its US farm visit but this was later attributed to concerns it could turn into a media circus or may be misconceived as meddling and was not due to any new difficulties in the trade talks.</p><p>In FX markets, price action in relatively quiet with the DXY partially giving back some of Friday’s gains which had been spurred amid a deterioration in risk sentiment and amid broad losses in its major counterparts, including EUR/USD which briefly tested 1.1000 to downside where it eventually found some support. GBP/USD is lacklustre beneath 1.2500 with UK PM Johnson pessimistic on reaching a full “legally operable” deal covering the Irish border at next month’s EU summit and amid reports UK’s proposals fell short of satisfying the objective of the backstop. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is higher after support held at 107.50 and helped by some early safe-haven outflows after reports clarified the China delegation’s cancelled farm visit was not due to a further deterioration in the trade climate, while antipodeans attempt to nurse recent losses following a stronger than expected reference rate setting with mild outperformance in NZD heading into this week’s RBNZ rate meeting where the central bank is expected to stand pat and with the New Zealand Shadow Board also recommending no change in policy.</p>",
