Reports emerged that Intel (INTC) and Apple (AAPL) held talks last year for Apple to buy Intelâ€™s smartphone modem business with Goldman Sachs hired to sell the unit which could reportedly fetch a few billion dollars. Walmart (WMT) shares fell following Amazonâ€™s (AMZN) announcement. Ford Motor Co. (Ford) was the top performer in the S&amp;P500 after the automaker reported a significant beat on both top and bottom-line expectations whilst reporting strong F-Series pick-up truck sales in the US. Automakers more generally outperformed, with General Motors (GM) also trading higher on the day. Colgate Palmolive (CL) traded higher after the consumer product maker reported earnings that were largely in line with expectations and the CEO expressed pleasure with organic sales growth in both emerging and developed markets. The positive mood helped lift the wider consumer staples sector, with P&amp;G (PG) and Kimberly Clark (KMB), also finishing higher on the day. On a less positive note, Intel Corpâ€™s (INTC) share price was hit despite beating analystâ€™s top and bottom-line expectations, after the chipmaker revised down Q2 and FY guidance. American Airlines (AAL) opened lower after the airline lowered full year guidance, saying it had cancelled 1200 planes due to the Boeing (BA) 737 Max grounding. Exxon Mobil (XOM) traded lower throughout the session after reported earnings that missed profit and revenue expectations. Chevron (CVX), who reported mixed earnings and released no extra colour regarding the Anadarko bid, also moved lower. More broadly, Energy stocks, including the above and Conoco Phillips (COP), were dragged lower as crude prices fell by north of 3% on the day. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) shares fell after the food processor reported earnings that missed on both top and bottom-line expectations.
