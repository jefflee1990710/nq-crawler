Facebook (FB) moved higher after SunTrust was optimistic that the social media platforms new cryptocurrency could \"dramatically\" expand the co.’s total addressable market and growth prospects. Disney (DIS) was moved lower after being downgraded by Imperial. Apple (AAPL) edged higher as Credit Suisse noted “less bad” than expected China shipment data, although gains were capped as JPM cut their PT for the iPhone maker. Dish (DISH) was buoyant on reports that it was leading the race to buy divestures from the T-Mobile US/Sprint merger. On which note, Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) both opened higher, after reports late last Friday suggest the DoJ were close to approving the merger.

General Electric (GE) was under pressure on dual negative stories; 1) they announced plans to cut roughly 450 jobs at two Swiss sites as it looks to address \"challenges on the global energy markets” and 2) GE Aviation found unexpected wear in a part of its new engine for Boeing’s new 777X passenger plane, resulting in several months of delays while the component is redesigned and tested. A flattening treasury curve did little to help financial names, such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C), who moved lower throughout the session.

New orders index also posted a significant decline, falling 22 points to -12.0, whilst the index for number of employees fell 8 points to -3.5, its first negative value in over two years, pointing to a small decline in employment levels. The shipments index fell 7 points to 9.7, pointing to a modest increase in shipments and prices received index fell 6 points to 6.8, marking a fourth consecutive decline and pointing to an ongoing deceleration in selling price increase. Pantheon's Chief Economist notes \"The terrible-looking Empire State survey was conducted in the middle of Trump's Mexico tariff threat. Usually the survey tracks China's Caixin PMI, so it likely will rebound strongly next month now that the Mexico fiasco is over.\"</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China’s economic regulators refuse to rule out the rare earths card against US, reported SCMP during early trade. Later, China's Global Times Editor commented that there is a of criticism in China's state media against the US at the moment, which serves to mobilise Chinese society for a protracted trade war and that mutual hostility of public opinion makes a compromise more difficult. On the US/EU front: Germany's Economy Minister Altmaier said the EU and US must urgently start negotiations on a trade deal which would also abolish all industrial goods tariffs, before adding that German companies need a level playing field in China, an issue which he will raise in talks in Beijing this week. On the US/Canada/Mexico front, a US Chamber of Commerce official said an objective to get a vote on the USMCA before the August congressional recess is a reasonable goal. Away from the US, the EU may halt the customs union talks with Turkey, according to a draft communique.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iran and Russia on Monday signed an MOU in the energy sector. As tensions escalate following the tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman last week, a senior Iranian official said that Tehran has recently exposed \"a large US cyber espionage network\". The official also said that Iran is in charge of Gulf security and called on US forces to leave the region. Other reports that the OPEC member has been exceeding the inventory limit on low enriched uranium will also be sure to aggravate the situation in the region. Iran also said that the production of low-enriched uranium will quadruple, meanwhile reports stated that the 60-day deadline for Europe to save the Iranian deal will not be extended.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Ahead of the Sintra meeting, ECB’s Coeure said the ECB should be conscious of the mixed messages data are sending, and that while the ECB should not blindly follow market pricing, it cannot ignore it; Coeure also insisted the central bank has ample policy tools, if required. Vice President de Guindos said that if inflation expectations became de-anchored, the ECB would act, however this was not the case at present.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.58 LOWER AT 51.93/BBL; BRENT (Q9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.07 LOWER AT USD 60.94/BBL:</strong> Crude prices are slightly on the backfoot to start the week, with geopolitical tensions failing to provide support, and option expiry on July WTI contributing towards Monday’s action. Analysts are continuing to highlight the oil market’s demand concerns as the overriding force currently. Citigroup energy analysts add said, “We’d bear in mind, however, that the demand fears are more of a look in the rear view mirror than a look ahead, driven or at least reinforced by revised 1Q data that was softer than expected… If nothing else, demand is likely to be seasonally stronger over the next few months.” Alternatively, BAML lowered its H2 forecast for oil, WTI to USD 56/bbl and Brent to USD 63/bbl, citing concern that while a Fed put, Saudi put and Trump put have been supportive of prices, if China were to continue importing Iranian crude WTI could drop to USD 40/bbl. Meanwhile, a date for the OPEC+ meeting has still not been decided; the proposed 3/4th July dates are seemingly a nonstarter after Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh announced he would not be able to attend, but instead suggested July 10/12th July.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 1 TICK HIGHER AT 126-31:</strong> Monday’s uneventful session was evident in the Tplex too, which saw US 10 years move sideways. Early on USTs moved in sympathy with the Bund, which saw fresh record low yields, before catching some mild bidding on the back of the disappointing US NY Fed manufacturing data. At settlement yields were mainly unchanged aside from the front-end, where the 2-year yield rose by c. 1.5bps, which saw the 2s/10s flatten by c. 2bps.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 2890, NASDAQ-100 0.6% at 7527, Dow Jones 0.1% at 26113, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.1%, Consumer Staples -0.2%, Energy 0.9%, Financials -0.9%, Health Care 0.5%, Industrials -0.3%, Information Technology 0.2%, Materials -0.9%, Telecommunication Services 1.1%, Utilities -0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) moved higher as the Paris air show kicked off and the aircraft maker secured a number of orders. Facebook (FB) moved higher after SunTrust was optimistic that the social media platforms new cryptocurrency could \"dramatically\" expand the co.’s total addressable market and growth prospects. Disney (DIS) was moved lower after being downgraded by Imperial. Apple (AAPL) edged higher as Credit Suisse noted “less bad” than expected China shipment data, although gains were capped as JPM cut their PT for the iPhone maker. Dish (DISH) was buoyant on reports that it was leading the race to buy divestures from the T-Mobile US/Sprint merger. On which note, Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) both opened higher, after reports late last Friday suggest the DoJ were close to approving the merger. Incyte (INCY) moved higher after the drugmaker’s Ruxolitinib cream met primary end points in a phase 2 study. Mosaic (MOS) caught a bid after being upgraded at BAML. Symantec (SYMC) was buoyant after the co. received an upgrade at Mizuho. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) jumped higher at the open after being upgraded by BMO Capital. Deere (DE) moved higher after the co. was upgraded at Baird. Kinder Morgan (KMI) were under pressure after being downgraded at Stifel. LyondellBasell (LYB) opened lower after being downgraded at Deutsche Bank. Conversely Corteva (CTVA) was upgraded at Deutsche Bank, and duly caught a tail wind. Array BioPharma (ARRY) shot higher on the news that Pfizer (PFE) would purchase the firm at a large premium. The latter fell slightly. Tesla (TSLA) moved higher after CEO Musk deleted his Twitter account, only months after reaching a settlement with the SEC regarding his Twitter use. General Electric (GE) was under pressure on dual negative stories; 1) they announced plans to cut roughly 450 jobs at two Swiss sites as it looks to address \"challenges on the global energy markets” and 2) GE Aviation found unexpected wear in a part of its new engine for Boeing’s new 777X passenger plane, resulting in several months of delays while the component is redesigned and tested. A flattening treasury curve did little to help financial names, such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C), who moved lower throughout the session.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>remained subdued ahead of<strong> </strong>key risk events later in the week, seeing downside in the wake of disappointing NY Fed Manufacturing survey data. Aside from the record monthly decline and negative print, June survey components were universally bleak, ‘cementing’ the consensus view that the Fed will flag an ease at the next meeting after this week’s convene. Likewise, <strong>EUR</strong> was uninspired, albeit seeing early strength on favourable rate differentials vs the buck, while the single currency may also have breathed a sigh of relief after an uptick in Eurozone Q1 wage and labour costs. <strong>JPY</strong> was flat, continuing to consolidate around 108.50 within a thin range. <strong>GBP</strong> traded with a downside bias, amid a lack of fundamental drivers, although one poll of conservative voters did show Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson with support in excess of 77%. <strong>CAD</strong> has marginally extended to the upside and is testing 1.3400 with no real reaction to Canadian securities data. <strong>NZD</strong> saw some strength on after a series of strong data prints (New Zealand Performance of Services Index, New Zealand ANZ Inflation Gauge) overnight. <strong>MXN</strong> lagged, with further negative comments from Moody’s following the country’s recent downgrade doing little to help. <strong>TRY</strong> found some respite after a welcome drop in Turkey’s jobless rate and continues to reverse post-Moody’s downgrade losses following the CBRT’s decision to link cheaper funding for primary banks to sovereign bond purchases, with the liquidity provision offered at 23% vs the current 24% benchmark rate. <strong>BRL</strong> took advantage of the Dollar’s minor downturn and got some independent impetus via latest reports on Brazil’s pension reform bill that the House Speaker hopes to see approved on June 26th. <strong>CNY</strong> was slightly firmer, with some traders pointing to the slightly firmer than expected overnight Yuan fix.</p>",

Aside from the record monthly decline and negative print, June survey components were universally bleak, ‘cementing’ the consensus view that the Fed will flag an ease at the next meeting after this week’s convene. Likewise, <strong>EUR</strong> was uninspired, albeit seeing early strength on favourable rate differentials vs the buck, while the single currency may also have breathed a sigh of relief after an uptick in Eurozone Q1 wage and labour costs. <strong>JPY</strong> was flat, continuing to consolidate around 108.50 within a thin range. <strong>GBP</strong> traded with a downside bias, amid a lack of fundamental drivers, although one poll of conservative voters did show Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson with support in excess of 77%. <strong>CAD</strong> has marginally extended to the upside and is testing 1.3400 with no real reaction to Canadian securities data. <strong>NZD</strong> saw some strength on after a series of strong data prints (New Zealand Performance of Services Index, New Zealand ANZ Inflation Gauge) overnight. <strong>MXN</strong> lagged, with further negative comments from Moody’s following the country’s recent downgrade doing little to help. <strong>TRY</strong> found some respite after a welcome drop in Turkey’s jobless rate and continues to reverse post-Moody’s downgrade losses following the CBRT’s decision to link cheaper funding for primary banks to sovereign bond purchases, with the liquidity provision offered at 23% vs the current 24% benchmark rate. <strong>BRL</strong> took advantage of the Dollar’s minor downturn and got some independent impetus via latest reports on Brazil’s pension reform bill that the House Speaker hopes to see approved on June 26th. <strong>CNY</strong> was slightly firmer, with some traders pointing to the slightly firmer than expected overnight Yuan fix.</p>",

Citigroup energy analysts add said, “We’d bear in mind, however, that the demand fears are more of a look in the rear view mirror than a look ahead, driven or at least reinforced by revised 1Q data that was softer than expected… If nothing else, demand is likely to be seasonally stronger over the next few months.” Alternatively, BAML lowered its H2 forecast for oil, WTI to USD 56/bbl and Brent to USD 63/bbl, citing concern that while a Fed put, Saudi put and Trump put have been supportive of prices, if China were to continue importing Iranian crude WTI could drop to USD 40/bbl. Meanwhile, a date for the OPEC+ meeting has still not been decided; the proposed 3/4th July dates are seemingly a non-starter after Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh announced he would not be able to attend, but instead suggested July 10/12th July.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Having respected key technical resistance just above the 97.604 intraday high, the index drifted back down through 97.500 and then breached support in the 97.457-6 area (21 and 55 DMAs) before slipping to new Monday lows (97.329) on the back of a much bigger than expected fall in the Empire State index. Moreover, aside from the record monthly decline and negative print, June survey components were universally bleak, ‘cementing’ the consensus view that the Fed will flag an ease at the next meeting after this week’s convene. Back to the DXY, the next downside chart level ahead of 97.000 comes in at 97.067 and represents the 100 DMA, which could be vulnerable given a weaker than forecast NAHB survey.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has reaped the most reward from the Dollar’s demise, as Eur/Usd soaked up offers stacked between 1.1230-40 and rebounded further from 1.1205 lows to just shy of 1.1250 where stops are said to be sitting. The Euro may have also breathed a sigh of relief after an uptick in Eurozone Q1 wage and labour costs as a counter to the latest decline in 5 year-5 year inflation expectations to a fresh record low.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>The Kiwi remains relatively firm vs its US counterpart following the overnight release of ANZ’s May inflation gauge showing firmer m/m and y/y prices, with Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6500 and attention now switching to Westpac Q2 consumer sentiment later. The Loonie has marginally extended to the upside and is testing 1.3400 with no real reaction to Canadian securities data given impending comments from BoC’s Schembri, while the Franc has kept its head above parity, but softened against the aforementioned ‘outperforming’ Euro between 1.1221-1.1191 parameters following last Thursday’s dovish SNB hold with an operation tweak to the benchmark policy rate.</p><p><strong>JPY/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>All marginally softer vs the Usd, but still rangy as the Yen holds within a 108.72-43 band awaiting the FOMC and then the BoJ that is also widely tipped to be dovish and reiterate a readiness to bump up stimulus if needed. Elsewhere, RBA minutes loom for the Aussie and further rate cuts are becoming more widespread amongst forecasters as Macquarie joins the band looking for an easing cycle with a 0.5% OCR prediction for the end of 2019. Sterling has not really benefited from some recent hawkish MPC commentary ahead of the BoE policy meet as the UK political void continues to weigh and Cable teetered above major chart and long term support at 1.2560, while Eur/Gbp posted fresh multi-month peaks at 0.8940.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>At last some respite for the Lira, albeit with help from retreating Buck noted above. However, Usd/Try started to pull back from 5.9250+ highs after a welcome drop in Turkey’s jobless rate and continues to reverse post-Moody’s downgrade gains following the CBRT’s decision to link cheaper funding for primary banks to sovereign bond purchases, with the liquidity provision offered at 23% vs the current 24% benchmark rate. Similarly, the Real took advantage of the Dollar’s downturn and got some independent impetus via latest reports on Brazil’s pension reform bill that the House Speaker hopes to see approved on June 26th. Usd/Brl now eyeing 3.8800 vs vs 3.9050+ at one stage and Usd/Try hovering just off sub-5.8550 lows.</p>",

(+0.2%)</strong> were both positive for most of early trade after the PBoC conducted a substantial liquidity injection and as the 2nd phase of its RRR cut took effect today which releases CNY 100bln of funds. However, momentum in the mainland eventually waned while Hong Kong outperformed after Chief Executive Lam postponed the extradition bill indefinitely.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European stocks are mixed in a continuation of the cautious tone seen in Asia</strong>, ahead of the central bank-packed week. Sectors are mixed with underperformance in the energy sector amid price action in the complex, whilst financial names lead the gains as banks benefit from the higher yields. In terms of movers, airline stocks took a hit after Lufthansa (-11.3%) cut its revenue and adj. EBIT margin guidance, citing increased competition in the market, and as such, Ryanair (-5.9%), easyJet (-5.3%) and Air France (-3.6%) all slipped in tandem. Elsewhere, Airbus (+1.0%) shares are buoyed as the Paris Air Show gets underway with reports noting the Co. has won a major 100-plane order over Boeing. Finally, Deutsche Bank (+2.2%) shares are feeling some reprieve after sources stated that the bank is mulling holding EUR 50bln of assets in a “bad bank” whilst also shrinking or shutting its US equity trading business.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar has maintained its post-US data positivity and the DXY is pivoting 97.500 with resistance close by in the form of a 61.8% Fib retracement of the relatively pronounced pull-back from May 23 ytd highs of 97.373 to June 7 lows at 96.451, and support sitting around 97.457-6 where 21 and 55 DMAs converge. In terms of fundamentals, the looming FOMC will be paramount as markets widely if not unanimously anticipate another dovish shift from the Fed and signal that rates will be cut in July. However, ongoing global trade wars and geopolitical developments are propping up the Greenback and other safe-havens to varying degrees.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - Bucking the broad consolidative G10 trend and largely rangebound Usd/major trade, the Kiwi has bounced back to straddle 0.6500 and appears to be deriving some impetus from firmer NZ inflation metrics ahead of Westpac’s Q2 consumer survey tonight. Moreover, Aud/Nzd cross-flows may be supportive as the Aussie remains depressed around 1.0550 and 0.6875 vs its US counterpart amidst more dovish RBA calls (Macquarie now expecting the OCR to decline to 0.5% by year end) in advance of June policy meeting minutes in the early hours on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/JPY/GBP/CHF</strong> - As noted above, narrow parameters vs the Buck for the most part as the single currency holds within a 1.1205-25 band and just above decent option expiry interest at the 1.1200 strike (1 bn). Contacts also believe that reserve managers are lurking at the big figure on the buy-side, while nearest chart levels are seen at 1.1171 (76.4% Fib of the move from 1.1116 to 1.1348) and 1.1250 (latter more psychological than technical). Meanwhile, aside from the aforementioned Fed meet, the Euro may get some independent direction from the ECB’s annual Sintra conference that kicks off today with an opening speech from President Draghi. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also sitting tight between 1.3405-20 and awaiting a speech from BoC’s Schembri, but Deutsche Bank expects the headline pair to spike on FOMC disappointment given overly dovish expectations and some BoC catch up, targeting 1.3665 with a 1.3225 stop (recent low). The Yen is holding in a 108.43-70 range ahead of the BoJ on Friday and Cable is hovering just below 1.2600 pre-BoE, UK CPI and retail sales with Pound bears aware that 1.2560 is last month’s trend low.

Sectors are mixed with underperformance in the energy sector amid price action in the complex, whilst financial names lead the gains as banks benefit from the higher yields. In terms of movers, airline stocks took a hit after Lufthansa (-10.5%) cut its revenue and adj. EBIT margin guidance, citing increased competition in the market, and as such, Ryanair (-3.9%), easyJet (-3.7%) and Air France (-3.6%) all slipped in tandem. Elsewhere, Airbus (+0.9%) shares are buoyed as the Paris Air Show gets underway with reports noting the Co. has won a major 100-plane order over Boeing. Finally, Deutsche Bank (+1.7%) shares are feeling some reprieve after sources stated that the bank is mulling holding EUR 50bln of assets in a “bad bank” whilst also shrinking or shutting its US equity trading business.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar has maintained its post-US data positivity and the DXY is pivoting 97.500 with resistance close by in the form of a 61.8% Fib retracement of the relatively pronounced pull-back from May 23 ytd highs of 97.373 to June 7 lows at 96.451, and support sitting around 97.457-6 where 21 and 55 DMAs converge. In terms of fundamentals, the looming FOMC will be paramount as markets widely if not unanimously anticipate another dovish shift from the Fed and signal that rates will be cut in July. However, ongoing global trade wars and geopolitical developments are propping up the Greenback and other safe-havens to varying degrees.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - Bucking the broad consolidative G10 trend and largely rangebound Usd/major trade, the Kiwi has bounced back to straddle 0.6500 and appears to be deriving some impetus from firmer NZ inflation metrics ahead of Westpac’s Q2 consumer survey tonight. Moreover, Aud/Nzd cross-flows may be supportive as the Aussie remains depressed around 1.0550 and 0.6875 vs its US counterpart amidst more dovish RBA calls (Macquarie now expecting the OCR to decline to 0.5% by year end) in advance of June policy meeting minutes in the early hours on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/JPY/GBP/CHF</strong> - As noted above, narrow parameters vs the Buck for the most part as the single currency holds within a 1.1205-25 band and just above decent option expiry interest at the 1.1200 strike (1 bn). Contacts also believe that reserve managers are lurking at the big figure on the buy-side, while nearest chart levels are seen at 1.1171 (76.4% Fib of the move from 1.1116 to 1.1348) and 1.1250 (latter more psychological than technical). Meanwhile, aside from the aforementioned Fed meet, the Euro may get some independent direction from the ECB’s annual Sintra conference that kicks off today with an opening speech from President Draghi. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also sitting tight between 1.3405-20 and awaiting a speech from BoC’s Schembri, but Deutsche Bank expects the headline pair to spike on FOMC disappointment given overly dovish expectations and some BoC catch up, targeting 1.3665 with a 1.3225 stop (recent low). The Yen is holding in a 108.43-70 range ahead of the BoJ on Friday and Cable is hovering just below 1.2600 pre-BoE, UK CPI and retail sales with Pound bears aware that 1.2560 is last month’s trend low. Finally, the Franc is holding just above parity post-last Thursday’s SNB and Eur/Chf remains confined either side of 1.1200.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Lira has pared some losses from 5.9250+ lows vs the Dollar after Moody’s downgraded Turkey’s credit rating deeper into junk with the aid of a much needed improvement in unemployment, while the CBRT has enhanced liquidity provisions for primary banks via a facility discounted by 1% vs the 24% benchmark rate and based on government bond holdings.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A relatively mundane Monday thus far, and not many if any catalysts for core debt, but having staged a recovery rally in early trade bonds have faded on what looks like a lack of follow-through buying as much as anything else. Firmer Eurozone pay and employment costs may have prompted some selling as an offset to sliding inflation expectations given that the 5 year-5 year forward continues to set record lows on a daily basis, but <strong>Bunds</strong> are holding just above Eurex session lows as Italian <strong>BTPs</strong> and other peripheral paper retreat/unwind earlier outperformance. Conversely, <strong>Gilts</strong> have retreated to a fresh Liffe base at 130.04 (-21 ticks vs +7 ticks at best) and US Treasuries are probing new overnight session troughs with the curve steeper ahead of the Fed and a couple of releases today (NY manufacturing survey and NAHB).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures continue to decline ahead of a risk-packed week with a number of bearish factors looming over the complex. <strong>1)</strong> US crude stocks have been on the rise, with inventory reports via both API and EIA printing surprise builds for two straight weeks.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has maintained its post-US data positivity and the DXY is pivoting 97.500 with resistance close by in the form of a 61.8% Fib retracement of the relatively pronounced pull-back from May 23 ytd highs of 97.373 to June 7 lows at 96.451, and support sitting around 97.457-6 where 21 and 55 DMAs converge. In terms of fundamentals, the looming FOMC will be paramount as markets widely if not unanimously anticipate another dovish shift from the Fed and signal that rates will be cut in July. However, ongoing global trade wars and geopolitical developments are propping up the Greenback and other safe-havens to varying degrees.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Bucking the broad consolidative G10 trend and largely rangebound Usd/major trade, the Kiwi has bounced back to straddle 0.6500 and appears to be deriving some impetus from firmer NZ inflation metrics ahead of Westpac’s Q2 consumer survey tonight. Moreover, Aud/Nzd cross-flows may be supportive as the Aussie remains depressed around 1.0550 and 0.6875 vs its US counterpart amidst more dovish RBA calls (Macquarie now expecting the OCR to decline to 0.5% by year end) in advance of June policy meeting minutes in the early hours on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/JPY/GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>As noted above, narrow parameters vs the Buck for the most part as the single currency holds within a 1.1205-25 band and just above decent option expiry interest at the 1.1200 strike (1 bn). Contacts also believe that reserve managers are lurking at the big figure on the buy-side, while nearest chart levels are seen at 1.1171 (76.4% Fib of the move from 1.1116 to 1.1348) and 1.1250 (latter more psychological than technical). Meanwhile, aside from the aforementioned Fed meet, the Euro may get some independent direction from the ECB’s annual Sintra conference that kicks off today with an opening speech from President Draghi. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also sitting tight between 1.3405-20 and awaiting a speech from BoC’s Schembri, but Deutsche Bank expects the headline pair to spike on FOMC disappointment given overly dovish expectations and some BoC catch up, targeting 1.3665 with a 1.3225 stop (recent low). The Yen is holding in a 108.43-70 range ahead of the BoJ on Friday and Cable is hovering just below 1.2600 pre-BoE, UK CPI and retail sales with Pound bears aware that 1.2560 is last month’s trend low. Finally, the Franc is holding just above parity post-last Thursday’s SNB and Eur/Chf remains confined either side of 1.1200.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira has pared some losses from 5.9250+ lows vs the Dollar after Moody’s downgraded Turkey’s credit rating deeper into junk with the aid of a much needed improvement in unemployment, while the CBRT has enhanced liquidity provisions for primary banks via a facility discounted by 1% vs the 24% benchmark rate and based on government bond holdings.</p>",

However, the 10 year benchmark is choppy within a tight 130.33-16 range vs the previous 130.25 Liffe settlement with nothing on today’s agenda and only Rightmove house prices out overnight. Looking ahead, CPI and retail sales are the last major data inputs for the BoE to ponder this week, while the Tory leadership race gets down to business this week as only 2 candidates will emerge and go head to head. Back to the MPC meeting, recent comments suggest that a couple of panel may be ready to turn more hawkish, but perhaps not enough to actually vote for a hike yet given the 9-0 consensus for unchanged, and the minutes should be revealing in this context.</p>",

As such, the greenback’s major counterparts found some mild reprieve from the recent selling pressure as <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> rebounded from support around the 1.1200 level and the nearby 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the late-May to early-June rally, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was also off worse levels but has so far failed to reclaim the 1.2600 handle. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> remained supported by the positive risk appetite in Japan and antipodeans nursed recent losses after <strong>NZD</strong> support near 8-month lows, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> composed itself despite further dovish forecasts for rates with Macquarie now expecting the RBA to lower the Cash Rate to 0.5% by year-end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An ally of Turkish President Erdogan has suggested that the nation needs to work on a ‘new and fair’ approach to controlling the FX rate that better suits the domestic economy and citizens.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was steady ahead of this week’s FOMC meeting where participants eye whether the Fed will pave the way for a cut next month and with prices also contained after recent USD strength spurred a pullback in the precious metal, while <strong>copper</strong> attempted to recoup some on the recent losses but with the rebound limited by the overall cautious sentiment.</p><p><strong>Baker Hughes Rig Count (14/June): oil rigs -1 at 788; nat gas -5 rigs at 181; total rigs -6 at 969</strong>.

(Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>A solid batch of data out of the US saw the curve bear-flatten, with shorter-dated yields rising about 2bps (at settle) vs yields on 30s declining by around 1bps. Early trade was defined by risk-off type flows, which led to some concerns that the 10-year yield could breach the 2.00% mark. However, haven trade was usurped by decent fundamentals, with traders reducing bets that the Fed could cut rates next week in wake of the upbeat data. The implied probability of a June rate cut has fallen to around 25% from around 33% on Thursday, while July pricing eased slightly too. However, the TPLEX found buyers after the inflation gauges in the Michigan Sentiment data declined sharply, challenging Fed Chair Powell's view that inflation weakness was transitory, and perhaps giving further credence to the notion that the Fed has grounds to cut based on inflation alone, let alone for \"insurance\" reasons to guard against the fall-out from global trade tensions. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower to the tune of 2bps. US T-Note futures (M9) settled 2 ticks lower at 126-30.</p><p>Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez Colin said on Friday that a retaliation list is ready if the US raises tariffs.

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp.

However, momentum in the mainland eventually waned while Hong Kong outperformed after Chief Executive Lam postponed the extradition bill indefinitely. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid the gains in Japanese stocks and following the bear flattening seen in US on Friday, with demand also dampened by the absence of BoJ Rinban operations in the market today.</p>",
