        "content": "<p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US President Trump said it is probably better to wait until after the 2020 presidential election for a China deal and there is no deadline on China deal but reiterated that he is doing very well in talks with China. US President Trump also repeated that it cannot be an even deal with China and noted that China called the US today and yesterday on trade, and that talks are at a critical stage. (Newswires)</p><p>US Vice President Pence said President Trump is willing to use tariffs and access to the US economy as he negotiates a variety of trade deals and wants reciprocal relations with other countries on trade, while he added they will continue to make clear that China must open up its market and that the administration has made it clear that the Hong Kong issue must be solved peacefully. (Newswires)</p><p>US Commerce Secretary Ross affirmed that President Trump is happy to go ahead with tariffs in the absence of a deal and the Hong Kong situation is a variable in the China trade deal, while December 15 tariffs will go ahead unless there is a reason to postpone. Ross also stated that US has more ammo left against China and President Trump has made it clear that he is under no time pressure to get a deal done, but added there is always a chance of a breakthrough that could impact the Dec 15 tariffs and reiterated the US will eventually get something done on trade with China. Furthermore, Ross later stated that several things are still needed to close a trade deal with China including details on products and quantities to be bought by China. (Newswires)</p><p>There were initial source reports that the White House is considering kicking Huawei out of the US banking system, although US Commerce Secretary Ross later stated he does not believe there is anything imminent regarding Huawei access to US banking system. (Newswires)</p><p>US is still going ahead with December 15th China tariffs, although reports noted one caveat is if a Phase One deal gets on paper or something else positive happens President Trump could choose not to impose them according to trade sources. (FBN)</p><p>China Global Times tweeted that US appears to be backpedalling in trade talks and tariff hike threats will have zero effect on China's stance \"because Chinese officials have long prepared for even the worst scenario\", according to an expert close to MOFCOM. (Twitter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>YouGov/Sky News Poll sees the differential in support between the Conservatives and Labour Party unchanged at 9 points; Conservatives 42% (-1), Labour -33% (-1), Liberal Democrats 12% (-1), Brexit Party 4% (+2), Greens 4% (+1). (Twitter)</p><p>Germany's SPD draft motion for the party's conference on Friday calls for additional public investment and that this must not be prevented by \"dogmatic positions\" such as \"black zero\" budget policy of no new debt, according to a document. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB Parliament Committee has approved the appointment of Panetta and Schnabel to the ECB Board. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump said the EU has to shape up or \"things will get very tough\" but later commented they will be able to work something out on trade and may work out the French digital tax or could have a substantial tax, while he also suggested within a short amount of time things will be rosy between the sides. There were also reports that the EU will seek immediate talks with the US on how to solve the dispute over the French digital services tax and comments from French President Macron that economic and trade issues with the US will undoubtedly find an outcome, while US Commerce Secretary Ross later stated it remains to be seen if President Trump would also place tariffs on other countries that impose digital tax. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (29 Nov) -3.7mln vs. Exp. -1.7mln (Prev. +3.6mln). (Newswires)</p><p>Iraq Oil Minister stated that an additional 400k bpd cut for OPEC+ is in circulation but not final and that it is his understanding that Saudi prefers a deeper cut. However, there were earlier conflicting reports that the OPEC+ committee reportedly did not discuss deeper output cuts ahead of the meetings this week according to delegates. (Newswires)</p><p>IEA oil chief said OPEC are quite likely to delay the decision on oil output until the market becomes clearer and Russia are not keen to make an immediate decision. However, other reports noted that Russia will most likely form a consensus with OPEC at this week's meeting and that OPEC+ still need to resolve issues such as quotas and condensate, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US President Trump said US is looking at Turkey's purchase of Russian's S-400 missile defense system and is looking at putting tariffs on Turkey as a result of the purchase, while he added you cannot be in NATO whilst purchasing Russian missiles. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump is looking at a new nuclear deal with Russia &amp; China, while it was suggested that it may make more sense to get a nuclear deal with Russia first then go to China. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said the US has not ruled out future tariffs on imported autos. (Newswires)</p><p>Mexico's Deputy Foreign Minister Seade is reportedly heading back to Washington to meet with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this week, according to sources familiar with the plans. (Politico)</p><p>Congress has reportedly seen \"near-final\" language for USMCA, although FBN's Lawrence reported he is hearing that no final language on USMCA is done, while Mexico is said to be at a hurdle on strengthening protections for workers but the feeling is ultimately Mexico will sign off. (Twitter/Fox)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>US President Trump announcing in London that the China trade deal is probably best delayed until after the 2020 election saw equity bourses sell-off, coming under additional pressure as US participants came to the scene; the overnight announcement of the US imposing retaliatory tariffs up to USD 2.4bln on French goods due to the Digital Tax didn’t support risk appetite either. The trade sensitive Semiconductor space (SOX) traded lower today after reports that the US could reimpose a plan which puts a ban of Huawei products on the US financial system, with the delay in China talks also adding to the downside. Financials were also lower amid lower yields and the rotation into defensives. The cloud space however traded rather well today, ahead of a slew of earnings tonight from CRM, ZS and WDAY, in addition to others this week, investors are expecting a stronger quarter for the sector following September’s disappointment. Netflix (NFLX) traded lower after a downgrade to neutral from buy at Citi, with a PT cut from USD 410 to USD 325, where the analyst believes the street estimates for the name are too high, noting they materially deviate from its long term pattern of a strong relationship between the company’s cash outlays on content and its net subscriber additions. Newmont Gold (NEM) traded higher on higher gold prices. Tapestry (TPR) was under additional pressure after a director sold USD 857k worth of shares. Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) traded lower on the back of reports US President Trump’s administration reportedly considered imposing a ban on Huawei from the US financial system, which was proposed earlier in the year, according to people familiar with the matter, who note the plan could be revived in the coming months. S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 3093, NASDAQ-100 -0.7% at 8255, Dow Jones -1% at 27503.</p><p>The TPLEX reversed its sell off from Monday following Trump’s announcement that a deal may not come before the 2020 election. The T-Note found support through the session and stayed close to highs in the last few hours of cash trade. The curve saw pronounced bull-flattening, predominantly in the front to belly, following Monday’s steepening, where the 2s10s narrowed from highs above the 22bps figure, to settle at lows below 18bps, closer to the lower end of the spread’s two-month range, further pressure could exhibit itself if Wednesday’s non-manufacturing ISMs paint a similarly dismal picture as the manufacturing figures did, although expectations are for 54.5 in the headline, a touch lower from the resilient 54.7 in October; of course the usual risk of further deterioration in global trade relations remains. At settlement, yields were acutely lower across the curve, with the 2-year down 7.5bps, 7-year down 13bps and 30-year down 12bps. US T-note futures (z9) settled 1 point and 2+ ticks higher at 129-31.</p>",

It is worth noting that Tuesday marked the last day for eligibility for the wash sale tax advantage, likely seeing participants liquidating some losing positions. Elsewhere, the souring trade sentiment saw a firm bid for the T-Note, reversing the 2s10s steeping from Monday, adding additional pressure to the Financials sector. Cyclical sectors in general traded the worst, including energy on lower oil prices, which found no support from supply updates; OPEC+ have reportedly not discussed deeper cuts ahead of their official meeting on Friday. Bucking the lower trend somewhat are some of the cloud-related stocks, including CRM, ZS and WDAY which report after the bell, as investors are expecting a rebound in their quarterly earnings from the September slump. On a macro scope, havens were generally bid, where XAU, CHF and JPY outperforming, the former moving across the 1,475 figure; Australia’s Perth Mint reported physical bullion sales at their highest in a year in November, an indication of the demand at the month’s lower levels. Looking ahead, the US services ISMs on Wednesday will be focused on as to whether they can continue to provide a firm picture, given the dismal manufacturing component; also note the BoC policy decision, where the bank is expected to stand pat on rates.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA</strong>: US President Trump started off the day reiterating how things are going well with China, however he announced that it is probably best to wait until after the 2020 presidential election for a China deal, adding there is no deadline for a deal with China, souring market sentiment from early on. China Global times also stated that the US appears to be backpedalling in trade talks, noting tariff hike threats will have zero effect on China's stance \"because Chinese officials have long prepared for even the worst scenario\", citing an expert close to MOFCOM. Fox later announced source reports that the December 15th tariffs on China are still going ahead, which only added to the trade worries. The sources however caveated by noting if a Phase One trade deal gets on paper or another positive is reached, then US President Trump could choose not to impose the tariffs.&nbsp; On the latest tariffs on Argentina and Brazil, Commerce Secretary Ross announced that it has nothing to do with China, however the Hong Kong situation is in fact a variable in the China trade deal. Ross also confirmed the earlier source reports that the December 15th tariffs will go ahead unless there is a reason to postpone. Ross also highlighted the US has more ammo to use against China, whilst noting the two sides expects staff-level dialogue but there have not been any high-level meetings scheduled. Yesterday, Commerce Secretary Ross in an interview noted that if there was no phase one deal, Trump has made it clear that there will be a tariff increase by the middle of the month. However, now it seems there is no set deadline, and that the Tariffs are expected to go ahead anyway, unless for good reason. US VP Pence later spoke to Fox, speaking to the President’s ability to cherry pick tariffs and market access restrictions as he pleases amid trade deal negotiations.</p><p><strong>* DIGITAL TAX: </strong>USTR office released its Digital Tax investigation into France, where it found the digital services tax discriminates against US companies, noting it will it will take action against the digital tax regimes which discriminate against the companies, while it is soliciting comment on proposed duties of up to 100% of certain French products over digital services tax and that list of French products subject to potential duties are valued at USD 2.4bln. France has since stated it is ready to retaliate following the threats. As the NATO summit went underway, President Trump stated they will probably be able to work it out with France and the EU, noting they usually can get it worked out, adding within a short amount of time \"things will be looking rosy with the two of us\". The initial announcement weighed on French luxury names (MC FP, RI FP, KER FP) given the proposed 100% tariffs on certain goods, however following the upbeat tone from US President Trump, a small reversal was seen in the shares. President Macron also expressed the two will undoubtedly find an outcome. The USTR also announced it is exploring whether to open Section 301 investigations on digital services taxes in Austria, Italy and Turkey, however US Commerce Secretary Ross later stated it remains to be seen if US President Trump would also impose tariffs on other countries that impose a digital tax.</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW: </strong>POLICY ANNOUNCEMENT DUE WEDNESDAY 4TH DECEMBER AT 1500GMT/1000EST. At its previous meeting, the BoC said it mulled an ‘insurance’ rate cut, and although it ultimately decided against it on financial stability grounds, though the central bank said it would monitor risks. Money market pricing does not foresee an insurance rate cut this week, pricing in just a 2% chance rates will be lowered from the current 1.75%, with around an 80% probability that rates will be lowered by the end of next year. However, desks are still cognizant of the possibility of an 'insurance' rate cut, given signs the labour market may be cooling, and some GDP growth trackers are running beneath current BOC economic forecasts. <i>Click </i><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23379/download\"><i>here</i></a><i> for full report.</i></p><p><strong>* HUAWEI: </strong>Report’s<strong> </strong>suggested<strong> </strong>US President Trump’s administration considered banning Huawei equipment from the US banking system earlier this year, according to people familiar with the matter, who note that the plan could be revived in the upcoming months depending on how things develop with Huawei. However, US Commerce Secretary Ross later on CNBC stated he does not believe there is anything imminent regarding the situation.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> Two polls from the first few days of December had the support differential between the ruling Conservative Party and Labour unchanged or expanding, seemingly halting the recent trend of a shrinking gap that has been observed since the parties released their manifestos. Kantar put the Conservatives 12 points ahead, up from 11 point in the prior week, at 44% (+1), Labour at 32% (unch). Later, a YouGov/Sky News Poll saw the differential in support between the Conservatives and Labour Party remain unchanged at 9 points, and put Conservatives support at 42% (-1), Labour at 33% (-1), the Liberal Democrats at 12% (-1), the Brexit Party 4% (+2) and the Greens at 4% (+1).</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>US President Trump, in London for the next two days for the NATO Summit, said the US is looking at putting Tariffs on Turkey as a result of the purchase of the S-400, explaining that you cannot be in NATO whilst purchasing Russian missiles, putting pressure on the Lira. Trump did not take a meeting with Turkish President Erdogan off the table during the summit. Elsewhere, the US put sanctions on six vessels linked to Venezuela’s PDVSA.<strong> </strong>Elsewhere,<strong> </strong>Chinese President Xi said they will work with Russia to counter western interference during talks with Russian Security Council Secretary Patrushev. President Trump also put forth the idea of discussing a new nuclear deal with Russia and China, noting it makes more sense to get a nuclear deal with Russia first and then go to China. Elsewhere, North Korea Foreign Ministry said dialogue with US has been nothing but a trick and that it will not continue talks with US which is using them for the upcoming election, while it warned of a year-end deadline in which it stated it is up to US what Christmas gift it will receive. In other news, China Global Times tweeted that China and Iran have reached several agreements on the Iranian nuclear issue and will keep deepening their ties and amid the difficulties and challenges caused by US sanctions and the withdrawal from the JCPOA.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Northern European EU Finance Ministers are reportedly providing pushback against the ECB’s negative rate policy in private engagements with the regions finance ministers, sources said. Elsewhere, ECB's de Cos spoke of the negatives of low interest rate policy; he said low rates for longer could spur risk-taking by some economic actors, which could threaten financial stability, while it could also hurt banking transmission channels of our monetary policy. ECB Board Nominee Schnabel said the ECB must listen carefully to concerns over the impact of negative rates and the ECB’s strategic review will likely yield small changes and clarifications. ECB's Visco said that he prefers bond purchases over negative interest rates, adding that negative interest rates have little effect and can have negative side effects on the financial system. Visco went on to argue that bond purchases could provide the groundwork for creating a joint Eurozone fiscal capacity. Finally, the ECB Parliament Committee approved the appointment of both Panetta and Schnabel to the ECB board.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 1 POINT AND 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-31. </strong>The TPLEX reversed its sell off from Monday following Trump’s announcement that a deal may not come before the 2020 election. The T-Note found support through the session and stayed close to highs in the last few hours of cash trade. The curve saw pronounced bull-flattening, predominantly in the front to belly, following Monday’s steepening, where the 2s10s narrowed from highs above the 22bps figure, to settle at lows below 18bps, closer to the lower end of the spread’s two-month range, further pressure could exhibit itself if Wednesday’s non-manufacturing ISMs paint a similarly dismal picture as the manufacturing figures did, although expectations are for 54.5 in the headline, a touch lower from the resilient 54.7 in October; of course the usual risk of further deterioration in global trade relations remains. At settlement, yields were acutely lower across the curve, with the 2-year down 7.5bps, 7-year down 13bps and 30-year down 12bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 0.14 HIGHER AT USD 56.10/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLED USD 0.10 LOWER AT USD 60.82/BBL. </strong>Hawkish trade rhetoric on both the China and EU front from US President Trump rocked global risk assets on Tuesday, putting crude markets under pressure. However, the complex held up well compared to stocks; front month Brent futures found strong support at the USD 60.30/bbl level, a previous low from the 20th and 29th of November. WTI, meanwhile, found support just below the USD 55.50/bbl mark, ahead of the psychological support at USD 55.00/bbl, which is also the 20th &amp; 29th November lows. Crude-specific news flow had less of an impact on Tuesday; the news that Russia will most likely form a consensus with OPEC at this week's meeting, according to sources, did little to move the dial. The sources added that OPEC+ still needs to resolve issues such as quotas and condensate. Russia have been including condensate in its calculations of crude output, something other OPEC+ countries have not been doing and something some desks argue is the reason for the country’s seemingly poor compliance. Elsewhere, the IEA’s Head of Oil said that OPEC are quite likely to delay decision oil output until the market becomes clearer and Russia are not keen to make an immediate decision. Note: OPEC+ will meet to decide on its next step on Thursday to Friday this week. Prior to the settlement, reports stated that OPEC+ members did not discuss deeper output cuts ahead of the meeting, according to delegates, which put some pressure on benchmarks. Bank of America noted that Brent prices could hit USD 70/bbl by the middle of 2020. Tonight’s API data is expected to show headline crude -1.7mln bbls, Distillates +1.1mln bbls and Gasoline +1.8mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 3093, NASDAQ-100 -0.7% at 8255, Dow Jones -1% at 27503,</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -1%, Consumer Staples -0.2%, Energy -1.5%, Financials -1.3%, Health Care -0.2%, Industrials -1.1%, Information Technology -0.9%, Materials -0.7%, Telecommunication Services -0.1%, Utilities 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) doubled in value after it entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Astellas (ALPMY) for USD 60/share in cash, equity value of USD 3bln; on Monday it closed at USD 28.61/share and a market cap of USD 1.31bln. AK Steel (AKS) was higher after the announcement it is to be acquired by Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) for USD 3.36/share, or roughly USD 3bln. AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) also announced it purchase of Allergan, Plc (AGN) received Chinese regulatory approval. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) traded in the red after it announced it is to acquire AWR from National Instruments (NATI) for roughly USD 160mln in cash. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Marvell (MRVL) announced that all the necessary regulatory approvals have been received for the acquisition of Marvel’s wireless connectivity portfolio, the two expect to close the deal in H1 of 2020.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The trade sensitive Semiconductor space (SOX) traded lower today after reports that the US could reimpose a plan which puts a ban of Huawei products on the US financial system, with the delay in China talks also adding to the downside. Financials were also lower amid lower yields and the rotation into defensives. The cloud space however traded rather well today, ahead of a slew of earnings tonight from CRM, ZS and WDAY, in addition to others this week, investors are expecting a stronger quarter for the sector following September’s disappointment. Netflix (NFLX) traded lower after<strong> </strong>a downgrade to neutral from buy at Citi, with a PT cut from USD 410 to USD 325, where the analyst believes the street estimates for the name are too high, noting they materially deviate from its long term pattern of a strong relationship between the company’s cash outlays on content and its net subscriber additions. Newmont Gold (NEM) traded higher on higher gold prices. Tapestry (TPR) was under additional pressure after a director sold USD 857k worth of shares. Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) traded lower on the back of reports US President Trump’s administration reportedly considered imposing a ban on Huawei from the US financial system, which was proposed earlier in the year, according to people familiar with the matter, who note the plan could be revived in the coming months.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD continued its fall to start the week as global trade concerns saw a flight to quality thus an inflow of havens, rate differentials also likely playing an impact with the US curve ~10bp lower across the curve. CNH was weaker against the buck on the aforementioned trade concerns where selling was exacerbated in the currency as Trump announced it is probably better to wait until after the 2020 election for a China trade deal. Havens were bid across the board with USDJPY finding support at the 108.50 handle, before the cross consolidated just above the figure heading towards the overnight session. XAU also performed well, rising from lows of 1460 exactly, to highs of 1481, a level it resides just beneath as the US market comes to a close. CHF also firmer against EUR, GBP and USD. Cable traded firmer today amid a headline beat to the Markit/CIPS construction PMI (although internals were weak) and the latest polls putting the conservative at a 12 point lead from a Kantar poll and at a 9 point lead from a YouGov Sky News poll, over the weekend some polls had the differential as low as 6. EUR once again traded relatively flat as EURUSD floated around the 1.1080 handle for the majority of the session after finding support early on at 1.1065. EMFX was generally weaker across the board, apart from yet again the BRL and ARS, which traded firmer and flat against the buck respectively. ZAR the underperformer today following a dismal GDP print which contracted this month by 0.6%, missing expectations for a 0.1% rise. TRY traded slightly weaker against the greenback following comments from US President Trump who noted they are looking at its S-400 missile defence system from Russia, noting they are considering tariffs on the nation for the purchase.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>Hawkish trade rhetoric on both the China and EU front from US President Trump rocked global risk assets on Tuesday, putting crude markets under pressure. However, the complex held up well compared to stocks; front month Brent futures found strong support at the USD 60.30/bbl level, a previous low from the 20th and 29th of November. WTI, meanwhile, found support just below the USD 55.50/bbl mark, ahead of the psychological support at USD 55.00/bbl, which is also the 20th &amp; 29th November lows. Crude-specific news flow had less of an impact on Tuesday; the news that Russia will most likely form a consensus with OPEC at this week's meeting, according to sources, did little to move the dial. The sources added that OPEC+ still needs to resolve issues such as quotas and condensate. Russia have been including condensate in its calculations of crude output, something other OPEC+ countries have not been doing and something some desks argue is the reason for the country’s seemingly poor compliance. Elsewhere, the IEA’s Head of Oil said that OPEC are quite likely to delay decision oil output until the market becomes clearer and Russia are not keen to make an immediate decision. Note: OPEC+ will meet to decide on its next step on Thursday to Friday this week. Prior to the settlement, reports stated that OPEC+ members did not discuss deeper output cuts ahead of the meeting, according to delegates, which put some pressure on benchmarks. Bank of America noted that Brent prices could hit USD 70/bbl by the middle of 2020. Tonight’s API data is expected to show headline crude -1.7mln bbls, Distillates +1.1mln bbls and Gasoline +1.8mln bbls.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, CNH</strong></p><p>Further trade angst sees DXY choppy but ultimately in the red heading into the EU close following yesterday’s initially ISM-induced decline to sub-98.00 levels, with the Index finding short-lived support around 97.75 after US President Trump showed no sense of urgency regarding a trade deal with China, and stated that it may be better to wait until after the November 2020 US election. Further, reports of the US going ahead with the Dec 15 tariffs added fuel to the risk aversion. DXY tested November lows around 97.70 ahead of its 200 DMA at 97.63, whilst USD/CNH was bolstered to session highs just shy of 7.090 (vs. low 7.0350) and side-lined reiterations from the US President regarding constructive talks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling stands as the marked outperformer heading into the end of the EU session after receiving impetus and sustaining gains from the latest UK general election Kantar poll, which showed a modest widening in the Tory/Labour spread. Cable took out resistance at 1.2985 (Nov 18th high) and eclipsed 1.3000 to the upside before hitting resistance at 1.3010 (Oct 21st high) and stabilising around the round figure. Meanwhile, EUR/USD was caged in a 20-pip intraday range (1.1066-86) after shrugging off sources reports of pushback on the ECB’s NIRP by EZ finance ministers, USTR’s proposal of levies on certain French goods and uneventful ECB speaks. Looking ahead, tomorrow’s docket sees the final numbers for EZ and UK services and composite PMIs with respective GDP trackers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong></p><p>Safe-haven demand sees both the Franc and the Yen bid heading into the European close, mostly on the trade front in light of aforementioned Trump comments, although a weaker Buck also contributes. JPY and CHF largely shrugged off earlier geopolitical developments, with punchy language out of North Korea regarding a pause in denuclearisation talks, having called the US’ attempt for dialogue a “trick” ahead of the 2020 elections. USD/JPY fell back to sub-109 levels to a low of 108.56 thus far and is poised to end the European session at the bottom of a 108.56-109.20 intraday band and south of its 200 and 21 DMAs at 108.94 and 108.89 respectively. Similarly, EUR/CHF fell below its 21 and 100 DMAs at 1.0968 and 1.0947 to a low of 1.0936 (vs. high of 1.0993).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Both ending the day on a firmer footing, albeit off best levels after Trump’s trade comments dampened sentiment. The Aussie outperforms its Kiwi partner after the RBA left its Cash Rate unchanged at 0.75%, as expected, and repeated that the Australian economy the gentle turning point in the economy - but reaffirmed data dependency and the readiness to inject further stimulus if needed. Analysts took note the slightly more positive tone in the statement which linked rising house prices to a potential lift in spending and residential construction. AUD/USD is set to end the European session around mid-range having clocked an intraday band of 0.6815-60, albeit the pair remains north of its 100 and 21 DMAs (both around 0.6820) with eyes on the Q3 GDP figures (Q/Q Exp. 0.5% vs. Prev. 0.4%) to shed light on the economy following the Central Bank’s easing measures and the government’s fiscal action. Meanwhile, NZD/USD retains a 0.65+ status heading into the end of the EU session and around the middle of a 0.6494-0.6533 intraday parameter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The EM space heads into the EU close mostly on the backfoot with the Rand underperforming as South Africa’s economy contracted on a Q/Q basis, missing expectations for modest growth. USD/ZAR took out its 200 DMA to the upside (14.5772) to a high of 14.6935 with little seen by way of resistance ahead of 14.7000. Meanwhile, the Lira saw renewed downside after US President Trump said US is looking at impose tariffs on Turkey over its purchase of the Russian missile defence system. USD/TRY surpassed its 21 DMA (5.7414) and extended on gains to 5.75+ levels to a high of 5.7624 vs. a low of 5.7300</p>",

In addition, China’s retaliation to the Hong Kong bill by sanctioning US non-profit groups and barring US military visits to Hong Kong, as well as expectations for the US House to pass a Xinjiang-related bill further exacerbated the already-opaque trade environment.

However, desks note of a slightly more positive tone in the statement which linked rising house prices to a potential lift in spending and residential construction. AUD/USD extends its gains above the 0.6800 level and surpassed its 100 and 21 DMA (at 0.6818 and 0.6820 respectively) to a current high of 0.6860 (vs. low of 0.6815) with clean air until the psychological 0.6900 mark.

Cable rose to a current high of 1.2994 after eclipsing its Nov 18th high (1.2985) with eyes remaining on election developments as election day looms. Meanwhile, the Single Currency held onto most of its gains vs. the Buck despite France’s growing trade tension with the US which prompted the latter to propose duties of up to 100% on certain French imports. EUR/USD meanders around the middle of a tight 1.1072-1.1086 intraday band, ahead of potential resistance at 1.1097 (Nov 21st high), with little impetus derived from ECB Board nominees and sources reports of pushback on the ECB’s NIRP by EZ finance ministers.</p><p><strong>DXY, JPY, CNH</strong> - The broad Dollar and Index resumes their downward trajectories following yesterday’s dismal manufacturing prints and with little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts.

Meanwhile, USD/JPY convincingly fell below the 109.00 mark (to a low of 108.84 vs. high 109.20) after US President Trump signalled no rush for a US-Sino trade deal. USD/JPY also sees hefty options of around USD 1bln expiring between strikes 109.00-10 and a further USD 1bln at 109.50.

US President Trump has today continued to stick the boot into the EU by warning the US will get “very tough” on the bloc unless they “shape up”.

From a UK perspective, Gilts are lagging their peers with gains minor in comparison to <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>USTs</strong> with the Mar’20 contract back above 132.00, having earlier printed a low of 131.96. Fundamental catalysts from a UK standpoint are on the light side with a firmer than expected UK construction PMI (45.3 vs. Exp. 44.5) unable to sway markets ahead of a solid 10yr auction from the DMO. Finally, <strong>USTs</strong> are firmer on the session, having extended gains above 129.00 and taking out the overnight high of 129.03+ in the wake of the aforementioned comments from US President Trump with the curve now marginally bull steepening and the 10yr yield back below 1.8%.

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Both outperforming in the G10 FX sphere, more-so the Aussie in the aftermath of the RBA’s latest monetary policy meeting in which the Cash Rate was left unchanged. Key themes in the statement were largely a copy-and-paste job from recent meetings which repeated the gentle turning point in the economy but reaffirmed data dependency and the readiness to inject further stimulus if needed. However, desks note of a slightly more positive tone in the statement which linked rising house prices to a potential lift in spending and residential construction. AUD/USD extends its gains above the 0.6800 level and surpassed its 100 and 21 DMA (at 0.6818 and 0.6820 respectively) to a current high of 0.6860 (vs. low of 0.6815) with clean air until the psychological 0.6900 mark. The Kiwi piggybacks on its antipodean partner’s gains and covers more ground above the recently claimed 0.6500 level vs. the USD to a high of 0.6530 ahead of its 200 DMA at 0.6544.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling rose in the G10 ranks in early European hours after the retrieval of 1.2950+ status vs the Dollar spurred upside momentum (amid potential stops/orders), and with tailwinds from the latest election Kantar poll (showing a widening gap between Tories and Labour) underpinning the currency in recent trade. Cable rose to a current high of 1.2989 after briefly eclipsing its Nov 18th high (1.2985) with eyes remaining on election developments as election day looms. Meanwhile, the Single Currency held onto most of its gains vs. the Buck despite France’s growing trade tension with the US which prompted the latter to propose duties of up to 100% on certain French imports. EUR/USD meanders around the middle of a tight 1.1072-1.1086 intraday band, ahead of potential resistance at 1.1097 (Nov 21st high), with little impetus derived from ECB Board nominees and sources reports of pushback on the ECB’s NIRP by EZ finance ministers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY, JPY, CNH</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index resumes their downward trajectories following yesterday’s dismal manufacturing prints and with little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts. DXY hovers around the bottom of today’s current 97.75-94 range with little on the today’s docket in terms of tier 1 data. Meanwhile, USD/JPY convincingly fell below the 109.00 mark (to a low of 108.86 vs. high 109.20) after US President Trump signalled no rush for a US-Sino trade deal. USD/JPY also sees hefty options of around USD 1bln expiring between strikes 109.00-10 and a further USD 1bln at 109.50. Subsequently, USD/CNH was bolstered to fresh session highs of 7.0630 (vs. low of 7.0360) in light of Trump’s comments on trade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EM</p><p>The EM space trades mostly on the backfoot with the Rand underperforming as South Africa’s economy contracted on a QQ basis, missing expectations for modest growth. USD/ZAR took out its 200 DMA to the upside (14.5772) to a high of 14.6680 with little seen by way of resistance ahead of 14.7000. Meanwhile, the Lira recovered from initial loses which emanated from US senators urging Secretary of State Pompeo to sanction Turkey over its purchase and testing of the Russian-made S-400 system. The TRY has since pared back a bulk of its losses as President Trump continues to support Turkey.</p>",

From a technical perspective, if the move to the upside continues, market contacts look towards the 170.25 area for potential stops. Fundamentals for the EU session have been relatively limited thus far in the aftermath of recent trade escalations with the US setting their sights on France with the US proposing 100% tariffs on USD 2.4bln of French goods as a response to the digital services tax. US President Trump has today continued to stick the boot into the EU by warning the US will get “very tough” on the bloc unless they “shape up”, however, debt markets have remained relatively resilient at the time of writing. From a UK perspective, Gilts are lagging their peers with the Mar’20 contract sitting just above 132.00, having earlier printed a low of 131.96. Fundamental catalysts from a UK standpoint are on the light side with a firmer than expected UK construction PMI (45.3 vs. Exp. 44.5) unable to sway markets ahead of 10yr supply from the UK as political risk remains at the forefront. Finally, USTs are marginally firmer on the session and hover around the 129.00 handle with the curve overall little changed. From a technical standpoint, analysts highlight the overnight high of 129.03+ as the most immediate form of resistance in the short-term whilst 1.8% provides support from a yield perspective in the interim.&nbsp;</p>",

However, Nomura says that the conditions are now ripe for technical investors to sell equities at some point in the first half of December. Thereafter, the question will become “the extent to which fundamentals-oriented investors dive into the market to buy perceived dips out of a heightened fear of missing out (FOMO).”</p><p>Nomura says it can picture a risk case in which sentiment deteriorates “unchecked”, with a “backswing” from the market's earlier optimism pushing sentiment below its one-year rolling average for “about 22 trading days”, a time period based on the average historical pattern in similar circumstances. “We think that, for this to happen, the S&amp;P 500 would need to fall below 3,100, while 10yr UST yields would simultaneously need to top 1.90%” says Nomura, a scenario which they think for now looks unlikely.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The RBA are widely expected to stand pat at its meeting on Tuesday with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures indicating an 89% expectation for the Cash Rate Target to kept at the record low 0.75%, and its associated implied yield curve pointing to the likelihood of a cut at the following meeting in February.</p><p>The rhetoric from the central bank has supported the consensus view that the RBA is open to future action but will likely bide it’s time for now as the recent Quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy noted the board is prepared to ease policy further if required and that pausing last month allowed time to assess effects of past easing and global events. Furthermore, the board was said to be mindful rates are very low and that further cuts bring other policy options closer, while it was aware more easing could convey an overly negative view of the economy and suggested the Australian economy is gradually coming out of a soft patch with global financial markets also appearing to have passed a trough of pessimism.</p><p>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle also advocated a wait-and-see preference citing a lag in the effects of monetary policy and that not much time has passed yet with more time needed for policy to work. Conversely, RBA Governor Lowe has not provided much in terms of fresh clues but has pushed back on the notion of QE which he stated was not on the agenda and that they would only need QE if the Cash Rate falls to 0.25%, while he reiterated negative rates are extremely unlikely and is said to be less convinced regarding the effectiveness of other unconventional measures with the jury still out.</p><p>Despite this distancing by Governor Lowe on QE, there are some that are not convinced, with several large foreign and domestic banks such as JPMorgan and Westpac anticipating QE may be launched as early as H2 next year to help the RBA achieve its objectives, while the recent slew of weak data also supports the case for more easing. These soft releases include a surprise contraction in Australian Employment for October at -19.0k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 14.7k) and rise in the Unemployment Rate to 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.3% (Prev. 5.2%) to widen the gap against the central bank's 4.5% target. Australian PMI data also slipped into contraction territory across the board for November, while Q3 Construction Work Done continued to decline albeit at a slower than expected pace of -0.4% vs. Exp. -1.0% and Capital Expenditure added to the disappointing releases at -0.2% vs. Exp. -0.1% (Prev. -0.5%).</p><p>These substandard economic releases alongside ongoing global slowdown concerns and US-China trade uncertainty, all support the case for why future policy measures cannot be fully taken off the table and that the central bank has to remain vigilant to risks despite having already cut rates on 3 occasions this year.</p><p>The announcement is scheduled for 0330GMT/2130CST/1130HKT and aside from the rate decision where a hold is seen as the foregone conclusion, focus will turn to the statement as any hints which support market pricing of a cut in February is likely to pressure AUD. On the other hand, the currency may find support on an unwinding of dovish bets should the RBA continue to suggest a turning point in the economy or lean back from QE.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls</p><ul><li>Citi no longer expects RBA to deploy QE next year citing recent comments from RBA Governor Lowe which suggested 0.25% is the effective lower bound for rates.&nbsp;</li><li>JPMorgan maintained its forecast for RBA to lower rates in February 2020 but now also see the RBA to launch QE by end-2020.&nbsp;</li><li>NAB recently pushed back its RBA rate cut forecast to February 2020 from a Prev. forecast of a cut at the upcoming announcement.&nbsp;</li><li>RBC sees RBA cutting rates to 0.25% in 2021 and to begin QE that year also.&nbsp;</li><li>Westpac forecasts RBA to lower rates to 0.25% by June 2020 and start QE in H2 2020.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets slumped amid strong headwinds from US where the major indices all but wiped out last week’s gains due to fresh trade concerns after President Trump announced to restore tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina, with increased tensions over France’s digital services tax and dismal ISM Manufacturing data also adding to downbeat tone. ASX 200 (-2.0%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are lower with underperformance in Australia due to hefty losses across its sectors including financials amid continued Westpac-related woes and with life insurers facing increased capital penalties, while sentiment in Tokyo is dragged by the adverse currency flows. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are also weaker on the trade uncertainty with some analysts reading in between the lines of the metal tariff resumption on Brazil and Argentina, suggesting that it could be another front in the trade war following the nations’ recent agricultural deals with China. In addition, China’s retaliation to the Hong Kong bill by sanctioning US non-profit groups and barring US military visits to Hong Kong, as well as expectations for the US House to pass a Xinjiang-related bill further exacerbates the already-opaque trade environment.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY only partially nurses recent losses and languishes below the 98.00 level after it was pressured by weak data including a miss on US ISM Manufacturing data and surprise contraction in Construction Spending, with President Trump’s fresh trade offensive doing little to reverse the USD woes. The greenback’s major counterparts have held on to most their recent gains although EUR/USD has slightly pulled back after the US proposed 100% tariffs on USD 2.4bln of French goods as a response to the digital services tax, and with GBP/USD supressed again by resistance at the 1.2950 level. Elsewhere, USD/JPY briefly slipped to the 108.00 handle on a double-whammy from the weaker USD and safe-haven flows, while NZD/USD remained near a 4-month high and AUD/USD at its best levels in around 2 weeks although stronger than expected Australian Current Account data was largely ignored as participants await today’s RBA rate decision.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat and have failed to take advantage of the widespread risk averse tone, as prices remain dejected following the recent bond rout and with participants also kept sidelined ahead of a 10yr JGB auction today.</p>",
