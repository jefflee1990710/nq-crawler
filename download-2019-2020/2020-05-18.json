President Trump also commented that some \"big announcements are coming\" and have already come out on therapeutics and vaccines for the coronavirus. Furthermore, Trump noted that he will provide a statement to the WHO in the near future and criticized that it has done a sad job, while he added that WHO is a puppet of China and that he was considering reducing the US contribution to WHO to USD 40mln (currently around USD 400mln) but added that some felt that was too much. (Newswires)</p><p>White House spokesperson called China's USD 2bln pledge to the WHO a \"token\" to distract from China's failure to warn the world of what was coming and stated that China has a responsibility to give more to WHO in the wake of the crisis. (Newswires)</p><p>White House Advisor Hassett said the Administration ready to take more COVID-19 spending action if needed although the final size will differ from the House Democrat plan, while he added that it appears US-China deal is largely being adhered to and that tensions with China are high. (Newswires)</p><p>NY Governor Cuomo said the western New York region is set to reopen tomorrow and urged sports teams to reopen without fans, while New Jersey Governor Murphy permitted some additional outdoor activities to reopen as the coronavirus spread continues to abate and Texas Governor Abbot stated that bars can reopen with limited capacity from Friday.

(Newswires)</p><p>Moderna (MRNA) announced positive interim Phase One data for its MRNA vaccine against the coronavirus. However, the trial was conducted across just eight patients and three of the eight patients who were on the highest doses, saw severe but not life-threatening side effects. Furthermore, Moderna expects Phase Three studies to begin in July. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>PBoC will cautiously control financial adjustments and will implement monetary policy, as well as macro prudent policy more creatively. (Newswires)</p><p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is expected to take a tougher stance on Hong Kong in his report to the National People's Congress, while Beijing is said to increasingly see Hong Kong as the weak link in China’s national security that could be exploited by Washington as Sino-US tensions hit fever pitch in the aftermath of the pandemic, according to sources. (SCMP)</p><p>Chinese Commerce Ministry said it will levy anti-dumping duties on barley imports from Australia from May 19th. (Newswires)</p><p>US Health Secretary Azar said there has been an \"apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak by at least one member state\", without providing any names.

Furthermore, the UK is said to have identified \"mutually high ambition\" for an agreement to cover services, investment and digital trade. (Newswires)</p><p>Germany and France have for the first-time proposed joint EU debt issuance. The nations have proposed a EUR 500bln recovery fund to give grants–not loans–to member states, while German Chancellor Merkel said that repayment would be over a long-time frame and that the aid package has a combined of EUR 3tln.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Fed Chair Powell reiterated pledge to maintain near-zero rates until the economy has weathered the crisis and Fed will use full range of tools to support the economy, while he noted that the passage of CARES act in March is critical to Fed's ability to expand credit programmes to help the economy. (Newswires)</p><p>NEC Director Kudlow believes the US economy is starting to turn, while he added the demand for housing, gasoline and the Apple mobility index are looking better. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>The week started in risk on fashion, supported by news of economies reopening and progress on vaccines and treatments. Traders were also encouraged by remarks from Fed chair Powell over the weekend, although some desks argued the market was being selective in its reading. The risk complex got a further shot in the arm on headlines out of Europe, where the French and Germans proposed for the first time joint EZ issuance. In aggregate, the result has been a traditional risk-on, with equities rallying, the VIX easing back into contango, crude rallying, Treasuries bear steepening, and the dollar lower. Moderna (MRNA) announced positive interim Phase One data for its MRNA vaccine against COVID-19; three patients on the highest doses had severe but not life-threatening side effects. Note that the initial study was conducted across just eight participants. Phase III study is expected to start in July. Grubhub (GRUB) reportedly rebuffed Uber’s (UBER) latest offer of 1.9 UBER shares for each GRUB share but talks continue, according to WSJ citing sources. Disney (DIS) announced it is to partially reopen its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping site at its Florida resort. Alphabet (GOOG) is likely to receive antitrust lawsuits from the DoJ and a group of state attorney general with a case expected by summer, according to WSJ citing sources. Tesla (TSLA) reportedly told employees that a health official signed off on the safety measures taken at its factory as it restarted production. The latest 13-F filings can be found here. SPX +3.2% at 2953, NDQ +2% at 9332, DJIA +3.9% at 24,597.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday amid a risk-on tone that swept across major assets to kickstart the week; yields rose from 3bps at the front-end to 13bps in the long bond. The downside in USTs and EGBs began in European trade as value/cylical/’real-economy’ stocks found their footing, particularly after constructive Fed Chair Powell comments from the weekend, and the news on a successful Phase 1 study of Moderna’s COVID vaccination – the pedigree duration-sensitive stocks were underperformers. The back-up in yields sustained into the US session, with bullish flows sparse amid the surprise Franco-German announcement of proposals for joint Euro issuance (coronabonds), emboldening risk appetite further, as well as raising the probability of further supply for the sovereign markets – Wednesday’s USD 20bln 20-year auction draws nearer, too. Supply indigestion was also made worse after Pfizer served the IG market with a four tranche USD 4bln deal, as well as continued offerings from other corporates on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, the Fed has tapered its weekly asset purchases by another USD 1bln per day; analysts question how much further the Fed can realistically taper given the record debt issuance and strained primary dealer balance sheets – the recent easing of the supplementary leverage ratio will have provided a much needed cash buffer for such. US T-note futures (M0) settle 23+ ticks lower at 138-19.</p>",

Traders were also encouraged by remarks from Fed chair Powell over the weekend, although some desks argued the market was being selective in its reading. The risk complex got a further shot in the arm on headlines out of Europe, where the French and Germans proposed for the first time joint EZ issuance. In aggregate, the result has been a traditional risk-on, with equities rallying, the VIX easing back into contango, crude rallying, Treasuries bear steepening, and the dollar lower, which has helped cyclically focussed FX to rally (even the beaten GBP, though it lagged other risk-sensitive FX like AUD and NZD), as well as EMFX. Gold printed another YTD high, but has backed off. Most of today’s gains were from companies that have been heavily beaten up this year (small caps and value baskets are leading), the R2K had a solid performance for once, while the momentum/COVID-beneficiaries lagged. With that said, the ES rally itself stalled out around 2,950, short of the April high around 2,965; technicians say the latter would need to be topped to open the door to the 200dma just under 3,000. Ahead, although the bulk of earnings season is behind us, there are some key reports due from the likes of WMT, HD and NVDA this week which will offer timely insight into how major companies are faring now the initial downside from COVID has passed (see here for earnings trends in Q1). Additionally, traders will be attentive to commentary from the Fed chief Powell on Tuesday (primer <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-fed-chair-powell-testimony-tue-fomc-minutes-wed-fed-listens-thu-18-05-2020\">here</a>). Elsewhere, the focus continues to be on virus headlines and responses out of Europe.</p><h2><strong>VACCINE</strong></h2><p>Moderna (MRNA) announced positive interim Phase One data for its MRNA vaccine against the coronavirus which spurred risk appetite. However, the trial was conducted across just eight patients, and three of the eight patients who were on the highest doses, saw severe but not life-threatening side effects. Moderna expect Phase Three studies to begin in July. The eight participants who received low and medium doses of the vaccine candidate had blood levels of virus-fighting antibodies that were similar or more than those in recovered coronavirus patients. Elsewhere, Gilead (GILD) notes that initial authorisation from the EU medicines agency for its remdesivir could be announced in the upcoming days. Also, a CDC US COVID-19 antibody test, expected in June or July, is to test up to 325k people and will test samples from 25 metropolitan areas, including New York and Seattle.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>After the US last week made moves to restrict the supply of US semiconductor chips to Huawei without government approval, there has been little pass through in Asian FX markets at the start of the week, Citi notes, although there has been some volatility in Asian semis. Citi warns that \"scope for Chinese retaliation is now a real risk on the horizon, with the country’s 'unreliable entity list' a possible method of targeting US companies,\" and speculates that China may use laws and rules like Cybersecurity Review Measures and Anti-monopoly Law to investigate and impose restrictions on US firms. \"Most US companies included on China's 'unreliable entity list' may be small-sized firms such as US trading agencies, which will be pushed to the brink of collapse; that could serve as a 'first-level' warning to the US over the Huawei ban before adding bigger companies,\" Citi writes, citing reports in China's Global Times newspaper on Friday.</p><p><strong>OFFICIALS: </strong>White House Economic Advisor Hassett stated the Administration ready to take more COVID-19 spending action if needed, though final size will differ from the House Democrat plan. Hassett added it appears US/China deal largely being adhered to, although tensions with China are high. When asked about Huawei, Hassett said the US is watching things closely. Fed has responded aggressively and will not probably have to do much more with interest rates if we become confident that a bottom has been reached. Elsewhere, Hassett noted credit card data is going up and the number of businesses open in the US is skyrocketing; things are moving forward faster than he initially thought. NEC Director Kudlow with a similar optimistic tone, believes the US economy is starting to turn, noting demand for housing, gasoline and Apple mobility index are looking better.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>JOINT ISSUANCE:</strong> Germany and France have for the first-time proposed joint EU debt issuance, a pivotal moment in the bloc’s history. The nations have proposed a EUR 500bln recovery fund to give grants–not loans–to member states. Merkel said the combined aid package now has a volume of EUR 3trln. The bonds would be paid back via the EU national budget, German Chancellor Merkel said, and repayment would be over a long-time frame (Germany’s share would be 27%, as in the EU budget). National Parliaments will also have to give the green light; there is the possibility of an EU Treaty change in the long-term, but this proposal is focussed on the short-term. French President Macron said the proposals had been made in conjunction with consulting the likes of Italy and Netherlands (the latter has reportedly been against the idea, while the former is set to be a key beneficiary). There has already been some push-back from Austria, who want it to be funded through loans and not grants. The key takeaways, analysts initially said, was that the new EUR 500bln would be backed by the EU budget, not an ESM-style backing by member state guarantees Others noted while the size is still small when compared to, say US responses, the precedent is more of a positive development for the bloc that states can commonly issue debt to address problems the bloc faces. One analyst said that while this time it took a pandemic to force the move, in the future, the bar may be lower.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED CHAIR POWELL:</strong> There was nothing particularly new for market players in Fed Chair Powell’s Sunday evening remarks. The recent data metrics are clearly being overlooked for now, and Powell stressed that medical metrics were far more important for the US economy; elsewhere, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate a new round of stimulus, Powell suggested that at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. There was a hint of optimism in some of Powell’s remarks: he said “if we are thoughtful and careful about how we reopen the economy so that people take these social distancing measures forward and try to do what we can not to have another outbreak... then the recovery can begin fairly soon,” adding that \"assuming there is not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you will see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year,” and “for the economy to fully recover people will have to be fully confident and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine.” The Fed chair also said that the Fed was not out of ammunition (“not by a long shot”) although again pushed-back on negative rates, and he is confident job losses would be temporary. Powell will testify to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and then speak at a Fed listens event on Thursday. The FOMC’s latest meeting minutes are also on the slate for Wednesday. Powell has spoken a few times in recent weeks, and it is unlikely the Fed chair will have anything new to offer, and as such, his comments are not likely to be a major risk for traders, analysts suggest.</p><p><strong>POWELL TESTIMONY PRIMER: </strong>This week’s testimony by Chair Powell on Tuesday, the meeting minutes from the FOMC’s April confab on Wednesday, and the Fed Listens event to be attended by Powell on Thursday are not likely to reveal much by way of new information, given the proximity of the recent meeting and the subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Powell. Accordingly, the message from these events is likely to be a reiteration that the Fed will take action it deems necessary towards supporting the economy and aiding its bounce back from COVID, although that is not likely to include negative rates at this stage; the Fed is also likely to again call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-fed-chair-powell-testimony-tue-fomc-minutes-wed-fed-listens-thu-18-05-2020\">Click here to access our primer</a>.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>BOE chief economist Haldane on the weekend said that the bank was considering a number of policies, including negative rates and boosting asset purchases to include other assets, as conventional room to ease was running low. Haldane emphasised that there were not imminent plans to implement these policies. Tenreyo also spoke on negative rates stating they are not ruled out, nor is any policy tool, and that she believes that negative rates had a positive effect in Europe, but there are some considerations that would be more specific to the UK. Haldane’s comments follow those of BOE Governor Bailey last week, who also did not want to rule out the policy for future use, and the theme will stay in vogue when BOE Governor Bailey delivers his testimony to the Treasury on Wednesday. The Old Lady is expected to boost the size of its QE programme at its next policy meeting, analysts believe, so any indications of the size the asset purchase programme will be raised by are also of interest (a consensus is developing around GBP 200bln-ish).</p><p><strong>ECB:</strong> Chief Economist Lane stated the ECB is constantly assessing whether we are doing enough and that the size/duration of its purchases can be adjusted, reiterating comments from President Lagarde. ECB’s de Cos stated the COVID-19 shock will last longer than expected. He also reiterated other officials that the ECB has to act to avoid fragmentation, noting that the response from Europe to the pandemic has been insufficient; the comments took place before Merkel and Macron agreed to propose a EUR 500bln fund in grants and proposed joint debt. President Lagarde welcomed the welcomed the Franco-German \"ambitious and targeted\" proposal for an EU recovery fund, and noted there is no risk to the Euro, the currency is irreversible.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 23+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-19</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday amid a risk-on tone that swept across major assets to kickstart the week; yields rose from 3bps at the front-end to 13bps in the long bond. The downside in USTs and EGBs began in European trade as value/cylical/’real-economy’ stocks found their footing, particularly after constructive Fed Chair Powell comments from the weekend, and the news on a successful Phase 1 study of Moderna’s COVID vaccination – the pedigree duration-sensitive stocks were underperformers. The back-up in yields sustained into the US session, with bullish flows sparse amid the surprise Franco-German announcement of proposals for joint Euro issuance (coronabonds), emboldening risk appetite further, as well as raising the probability of further supply for the sovereign markets – Wednesday’s USD 20bln 20-year auction draws nearer, too. Supply indigestion was also made worse after Pfizer served the IG market with a four tranche USD 4bln deal, as well as continued offerings from other corporates on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, the Fed has tapered its weekly asset purchases by another USD 1bln per day; analysts question how much further the Fed can realistically taper given the record debt issuance and strained primary dealer balance sheets – the recent easing of the supplementary leverage ratio will have provided a much needed cash buffer for such.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 2.39 HIGHER AT USD 31.82; WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 2.13 HIGHER AT USD 31.65; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 2.31 HIGHER AT USD 34.81</strong></p><p>Crude rallied at the start of the week, amid a more constructive backdrop for the demand-side of the equation; analysts noted that economies reopening and restrictions are relaxed is a positive development, and analysts have pointed to news reports like those from India, where fuel demand has recovered off April lows, and in China, where some reports have stated that demand is back to around the 13mln BPD level. On the supply side, there remains encouragement after last week’s inventory builds, and hopes that the overhang of global inventories will soon face draws; additionally, tracking estimates by Petro-Logistics suggests that OPEC+ exports will drop by a huge 5.96mkn BPD in the first 13 days of May v April averages. Analysts at Citi also cited some technical factors for today’s oil moves, noting that a “technical squeeze that has wedged nearby June WTI futures to a backwardation premium over the July contract ahead of Tuesday’s contract expiration, and that the nearby tightness has emerged after ETF, index fund and other traders fled the June contract three weeks ago to avoid a repeat of the May contract collapse into negative territory.” But Citi retains a hint of pessimism and still believes that there is a surplus of crude oil and products in the system, including excess diesel fuel from Asian refiners which is said to be bound for Europe, as well as Saudi crude heading towards the US. “For all of the large swings in both supply and demand, we doubt the physical market has actually flipped from glut to shortage in a blink,” the bank writes, “only the paper market has.” Note that US President Trump asserted his optimism in the complex, tweeting today, “OIL (ENERGY) IS BACK!!!!”.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p>NAHB HOUSING MARKET INDEX (MAY): The housing market index rose from 30.0 to 37.0, above analyst expectations of 35.0. Albeit a beat and a rise, the index remains at levels seen in 2012 after its recent steep decline. Pantheon Macroeconomics believes there is scope for it to rise further over the next few months, and it highlights how mortgage applications have recovered over half the drop, while Google searches for “new home” are above the pre-virus peak. Sales over the next 6-months increased by 10.0 points to 46, the May data showed, while present sales ticked up to 42.0 from 36.0. Traffic of prospective buyers rose 8 points to 21.0. Pantheon believes “that the pool of potential homebuyers has shrunk by much less than the drop in payrolls, because the first big wave of layoffs was concentrated in sectors where most employees are relatively young, and low paid.”</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +3.2% at 2953, NDQ +2% at 9332, DJIA +3.9% at 24,597</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy +7.6%, Industrials +6.6%, Financials +5.3%, Real Estate +4.9%, Materials +4.6%, Utilities +4.1%, Discretionary +3.2%, Technology +2.6%, Communications +2.1%, Consumer Staples +1.7%, Health Care +0.9%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Moderna (MRNA) announced positive interim Phase One data for its MRNA vaccine against COVID-19; three patients on the highest doses had severe but not life-threatening side effects.

Grubhub (GRUB) reportedly rebuffed Uber’s (UBER) latest offer of 1.9 UBER shares for each GRUB share but talks continue, according to WSJ citing sources.

The news set the tone for the day. Downside was exacerbated by gains in the EUR after German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron agreed on the need for a EUR 500bln coronavirus fund in grants, not loans and both agreed to propose joint EU debt issuance. The news saw EUR among FX outperformers seeing EURUSD back above 1.09 to highs of 1.0926 from lows of 1.0801.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS:</strong> Risk friendly currencies performed well today amid a tumbling dollar as risk sentiment was buoyed on vaccine hopes and reopening of the economy seeing solid performance in AUD, NZD &amp; CAD, however GBP, albeit still firmer, is lagging due to dovish central bank commentary. The looney caught another tailwind due to the rally in crude, USD selling, and the improved risk appetite, the trifecta saw USDCAD back beneath 1.40 from 1.4116 after the reopen of electronic trade.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Despite high-beta/cyclical FX starting the week on the front-foot, Sterling is lagging after BOE chief economist Haldane on the weekend said that the bank was considering a number of policies, including negative rates and boosting asset purchases to include other assets, as conventional room to ease was running low. Haldane emphasised that there were not imminent plans to implement these policies. Tenreyo also spoke on negative rates stating they are not ruled out and that she believes that negative rates had a positive effect in Europe. Haldane’s comments follow those of BOE Governor Bailey last week, who also did not want to rule out the policy for future use, and the theme will stay in vogue when BOE Governor Bailey delivers his testimony to the Treasury on Wednesday. The Old Lady is expected to boost the size of its QE programme at its next policy meeting, analysts believe, so any indications of the size the asset purchase programme will be raised by are also of interest (a consensus is developing around GBP 200bln-ish). Sterling is also facing headwinds as Brexit negotiations resume. And on the data slate, there is tier one releases due this week; SocGen says bears will not need much encouragement to lower short-term targets for the pound if the trio of first-tier UK data disappoint this week, starting with employment tomorrow and ending with retail sales on Friday.</p><p><strong>CHF:</strong> SNB’s Maechler on the weekend said the central bank was intervening intensively in FX to shield the Swiss economy, noting that the pressure on the CHF has risen considerably. She argued that the rise of CHF versus the EUR would have been much more pronounced if the SNB had not been prepared to intervene more heavily. Maechler said that Switzerland was unlikely to see a slim v-shaped recovery. CHF has been lingering around 1.05, though Maechler said the SNB had not got any formal or informal upper band for the level of the currency, stating that it looks at the entire currency situation. However, Maechler said that the central bank bought stocks during the turmoil in March in order to maintain around 20% of its reserves invested in equities. Maechler also dismissed the notion of a bigger payout to the government from the profits the central bank generates, stating that it would contravene the SNB’s monetary policy. Goldman Sachs notes that sight deposits have increased for 17 weeks in a row, and are now CHF 85bln higher than at the start of the year, and FX reserve data show a similar picture. “As a result, the currency is trading much weaker than fundamentals would suggest,” GS writes, “with the currency facing persistent pressures, the SNB will need to weigh the costs of a mounting balance sheet.” GS continues to recommend short EURCHF targeting 1.02 in 3-months.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> Japanese GDP came in slightly better than expected overnight, printing -0.9% Q/Q against the consensus -1.2%, meaning that Japan’s economy has now fallen into recession. All major components were lower, and analysts warn that it might be worse ahead, with COVID presenting challenges regarding the impact of the virus to trade and the domestic economy, UOB said. “The real test of the severity of the COVID-19 driven GDP contraction will be in the current quarter, 2Q 2020,” the bank writes, “we have further revised our forecast of the 2Q contraction to be more severe, at -5% Q/Q; this is slightly worse than the sharpest contraction Japan experienced during the great recession in 2008/2009.” With markets facing a risk friendly environment today the JPY traded weaker against a falling dollar and remained within the 107.05-107.50 parameters.</p><p><strong>GOLD:</strong> The yellow metal has printed fresh YTD highs at the start of the week, supported by technicals, falling real rates, while US/China tensions has also kept gold in demand. Many desks are now talking about a move towards USD 1,800. Today’s price action was however quite choppy after the precious metal saw highs of 1764, although as equities rallied and risk sentiment was bolstered, gold entered negative territory to intraday lows of 1728.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The RBA meeting minutes due overnight are not expected to be a game changer, and RBC says that the minutes have largely been superseded by the quarterly SOMP, which provided some updated forecasts on a number of key variables: GDP, inflation, and unemployment through to mid‐2022 as well some alternative scenarios. RBC says “any discussion around its unconventional policy is likely to repeat a willingness to ‘scale up’ bond buying if needed.”</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Positive risk sentiment saw EM perform very well with outperformance in the BRL, while MXN and RUB caught a tailwind from the solid gains in crude prices, which in turn likely prevented gains in TRY; which was the relative EMFX underperformer today. The BRL saw solid gains against the falling buck today as President Bolsonaro continues to push towards an economic reopening. However, after its latest health minister resigned (after his predecessor was fired) political worries in Brazil continue to overhang. Elsewhere, HSBC highlight reports that the federal police tipped off President Bolsonaro’s son that they were to open an investigation into his former aide. HSBC remains BRL bearish, noting it recently adjusted its year-end target to 6.20.</p>",

The nations have proposed a EUR 500bln recovery fund to give grants–not loans–to member states. Merkel said the combined aid package now has a volume of EUR 3trln. The bonds would be paid back via the EU national budget, German Chancellor Merkel said, and repayment would be over a long-time frame (Germany’s share would be 27%, as in the EU budget). National Parliaments will also have to give the green light; there is the possibility of an EU Treaty change in the long-term, but this proposal is focussed on the short-term. French President Macron said the proposals had been made in conjunction with consulting the likes of Italy and Netherlands (the latter has reportedly been against the idea, while the former is set to be a key beneficiary). There has already been some push-back from Austria, who want it to be funded through loans and not grants. The key takeaways, analysts initially said, was that the new EUR 500bln would be backed by the EU budget, not an ESM-style backing by member state guarantees Others noted while the size is still small when compared to, say US responses, the precedent is more of a positive development for the bloc that states can commonly issue debt to address problems the bloc faces. One analyst said that while this time it took a pandemic to force the move, in the future, the bar may be lower.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday amid a risk-on tone that swept across major assets to kickstart the week; yields rose from 3bps at the front-end to 13bps in the long bond. The downside in USTs and EGBs began in European trade as value/cylical/’real-economy’ stocks found their footing, particularly after constructive Fed Chair Powell comments from the weekend, and the news on a successful Phase 1 study of Moderna’s COVID vaccination – the pedigree duration-sensitive stocks were underperformers. The back-up in yields sustained into the US session, with bullish flows sparse amid the surprise Franco-German announcement of proposals for joint Euro issuance (coronabonds), emboldening risk appetite further, as well as raising the probability of further supply for the sovereign markets – Wednesday’s USD 20bln 20-year auction draws nearer, too. Supply indigestion was also made worse after Pfizer served the IG market with a four tranche USD 4bln deal, as well as continued offerings from other corporates on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, the Fed has tapered its weekly asset purchases by another USD 1bln per day; analysts question how much further the Fed can realistically taper given the record debt issuance and strained primary dealer balance sheets – the recent easing of the supplementary leverage ratio will have provided a much needed cash buffer for such.</p>",

On the supply side, there remains encouragement after last week’s inventory builds, and hopes that the overhang of global inventories will soon face draws; additionally, tracking estimates by Petro-Logistics suggests that OPEC+ exports will drop by a huge 5.96mkn BPD in the first 13 days of May v April averages. Analysts at Citi also cited some technical factors for today’s oil moves, noting that a “technical squeeze that has wedged nearby June WTI futures to a backwardation premium over the July contract ahead of Tuesday’s contract expiration, and that the nearby tightness has emerged after ETF, index fund and other traders fled the June contract three weeks ago to avoid a repeat of the May contract collapse into negative territory.” But Citi retains a hint of pessimism and still believes that there is a surplus of crude oil and products in the system, including excess diesel fuel from Asian refiners which is said to be bound for Europe, as well as Saudi crude heading towards the US. “For all of the large swings in both supply and demand, we doubt the physical market has actually flipped from glut to shortage in a blink,” the bank writes, “only the paper market has.” Note that US President Trump asserted his optimism in the complex, tweeting today, “OIL (ENERGY) IS BACK!!!!”.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD, EUR: </strong>The greenback was slammed amid favourable risk conditions, falling from 100.47 at the highs to 99.58 at the lows as a combination of vaccine and bounce back hopes while economies are starting to reopen. The news set the tone for the day. Downside was exacerbated by gains in the EUR after German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron agreed on the need for a EUR 500bln coronavirus fund in grants, not loans and both agreed to propose joint EU debt issuance. The news saw EUR among FX outperformers seeing EURUSD back above 1.09 to highs of 1.0926 from lows of 1.0801.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS: </strong>Risk friendly currencies performed well today amid a tumbling dollar as risk sentiment was buoyed on vaccine hopes and reopening of the economy seeing solid performance in AUD, NZD &amp; CAD, however GBP, albeit still firmer, is lagging due to dovish central bank commentary. The looney caught another tailwind due to the rally in crude, USD selling, and the improved risk appetite, the trifecta saw USDCAD back beneath 1.40 from 1.4116 after the reopen of electronic trade.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Despite high-beta/cyclical FX starting the week on the front-foot, Sterling is lagging after BOE chief economist Haldane on the weekend said that the bank was considering a number of policies, including negative rates and boosting asset purchases to include other assets, as conventional room to ease was running low. Haldane emphasised that there were not imminent plans to implement these policies. Tenreyo also spoke on negative rates stating they are not ruled out and that she believes that negative rates had a positive effect in Europe. Haldane’s comments follow those of BOE Governor Bailey last week, who also did not want to rule out the policy for future use, and the theme will stay in vogue when BOE Governor Bailey delivers his testimony to the Treasury on Wednesday. The Old Lady is expected to boost the size of its QE programme at its next policy meeting, analysts believe, so any indications of the size the asset purchase programme will be raised by are also of interest (a consensus is developing around GBP 200bln-ish). Sterling is also facing headwinds as Brexit negotiations resume. And on the data slate, there is tier one releases due this week; SocGen says bears will not need much encouragement to lower short-term targets for the pound if the trio of first-tier UK data disappoint this week, starting with employment tomorrow and ending with retail sales on Friday.</p><p><strong>CHF: </strong>SNB's Maechler on the weekend said the central bank was intervening intensively in FX to shield the Swiss economy, noting that the pressure on the CHF has risen considerably. She argued that the rise of CHF versus the EUR would have been much more pronounced if the SNB had not been prepared to intervene more heavily. Maechler said that Switzerland was unlikely to see a slim v-shaped recovery. CHF has been lingering around 1.05, though Maechler said the SNB had not got any formal or informal upper band for the level of the currency, stating that it looks at the entire currency situation. However, Maechler said that the central bank bought stocks during the turmoil in March in order to maintain around 20% of its reserves invested in equities. Maechler also dismissed the notion of a bigger payout to the government from the profits the central bank generates, stating that it would contravene the SNB's monetary policy. Goldman Sachs notes that sight deposits have increased for 17 weeks in a row, and are now CHF 85bln higher than at the start of the year, and FX reserve data show a similar picture. \"As a result, the currency is trading much weaker than fundamentals would suggest,\" GS writes, \"with the currency facing persistent pressures, the SNB will need to weigh the costs of a mounting balance sheet.\" GS continues to recommend short EURCHF targeting 1.02 in 3-months.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>Japanese GDP came in slightly better than expected overnight, printing -0.9% Q/Q against the consensus -1.2%, meaning that Japan's economy has now fallen into recession. All major components were lower, and analysts warn that it might be worse ahead, with COVID presenting challenges regarding the impact of the virus to trade and the domestic economy, UOB said. \"The real test of the severity of the COVID-19 driven GDP contraction will be in the current quarter, 2Q 2020,\" the bank writes, \"we have further revised our forecast of the 2Q contraction to be more severe, at -5% Q/Q; this is slightly worse than the sharpest contraction Japan experienced during the great recession in 2008/2009.\" With markets facing a risk friendly environment today the JPY traded weaker against a falling dollar and remained within the 107.05-107.50 parameters.</p><p><strong>GOLD: </strong>The yellow metal has printed fresh YTD highs at the start of the week, supported by technicals, falling real rates, while US/China tensions has also kept gold in demand. Many desks are now talking about a move towards USD 1,800. Today’s price action was however quite choppy after the precious metal saw highs of 1764, although as equities rallied and risk sentiment was bolstered, gold entered negative territory to intraday lows of 1728.</p><p><strong>AUD: </strong>The RBA meeting minutes due overnight are not expected to be a game changer, and RBC says that the minutes have largely been superseded by the quarterly SOMP, which provided some updated forecasts on a number of key variables: GDP, inflation, and unemployment through to mid‐2022 as well some alternative scenarios. RBC says “any discussion around its unconventional policy is likely to repeat a willingness to ‘scale up’ bond buying if needed.”</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>Positive risk sentiment saw EM perform very well with outperformance in the BRL, while MXN and RUB caught a tailwind from the solid gains in crude prices, which in turn likely prevented gains in TRY; which was the relative EMFX underperformer today. The BRL saw solid gains against the falling buck today as President Bolsonaro continues to push towards an economic reopening. However, after its latest health minister resigned (after his predecessor was fired) political worries in Brazil continue to overhang. Elsewhere, HSBC highlight reports that the federal police tipped off President Bolsonaro’s son that they were to open an investigation into his former aide. HSBC remains BRL bearish, noting it recently adjusted its year-end target to 6.20.</p>",

Sales over the next 6-months increased by 10.0 points to 46, the May data showed, while present sales ticked up to 42.0 from 36.0. Traffic of prospective buyers rose 8 points to 21.0. Pantheon believes “that the pool of potential homebuyers has shrunk by much less than the drop in payrolls, because the first big wave of layoffs was concentrated in sectors where most employees are relatively young, and low paid.”</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>PROPOSAL: </strong>Germany and France have for the first-time proposed joint EU debt issuance, a pivotal moment in the bloc’s history. The nations have proposed a EUR 500bln recovery fund to give grants–not loans–to member states. Merkel said the combined aid package now has a volume of EUR 3trln. The bonds would be paid back via the EU national budget, German Chancellor Merkel said, and repayment would be over a long-time frame (Germany’s share would be 27%, as in the EU budget). National Parliaments will also have to give the green light; there is the possibility of an EU Treaty change in the long-term, but this proposal is focussed on the short-term. French President Macron said the proposals had been made in conjunction with consulting the likes of Italy and Netherlands (the latter has reportedly been against the idea, while the former is set to be a key beneficiary).</p><p><strong>SNAP ANALYSIS: </strong>The key takeaways, analysts initially said, was that the new EUR 500bln would be backed by the EU budget, not an ESM-style backing by member state guarantees Others noted while the size is still small when compared to, say US responses, the precedent is more of a positive development for the bloc that states can commonly issue debt to address problems the bloc faces. One analyst said that while this time it took a pandemic to force the move, in the future, the bar may be lower.</p><p><strong>MARKET REACTION: </strong>The market has taken this as a big positive, and risk has continued to rally in wake of the announcement; however, ES topped out around 2950, short of the April high at 2965; EUR, meanwhile, is struggling to vault 1.09 with any degree of conviction.</p>",

Elsewhere, the Loonie has now extended its crude inspired revival by more than a big figure from around 1.4116 ahead of Tuesday’s Canadian house price data and the Swedish Krona is being carried by risk-on flows to around 10.6000 vs the single currency even though the Labour Market Board see unemployment at nearly 8.5% in mid-May.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also firmer relative to the Dollar on the aforementioned pick-up in risk positioning, with Eur/Usd bouncing from 1.0800 to 1.0890+ following a further slowing in Eurozone COVID-19 cases and fatalities as member states re-open and reports that France and Germany are both now backing joint EU debt issuance. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is back beneath 0.9700 from 0.9730+ in contrast to Eur/Chf holding above 1.0500 and last week’s new almost 5 year lows closer to the round number that the SNB denies forms any kind of tolerance limit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>Monday’s laggards on a general unwinding of safe-haven premium, as the Yen gradually lost ground against the Greenback from 107.05 to 107.50, but not quite in time to trigger 2.2 bn expiry interest at the half round number for the NY cut, while Gold pared back from Usd 1760+ through Usd 1750 and stops on a break of Usd 1743 to sub-Usd 1730.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad appreciation vs the Usd, but the commodity currencies doing particularly well and the Lira not suffering due to considerably higher imported crude costs as Try liquidity dried up to the extent that 2 big clearing platforms ceased trading.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>SNAPSHOT: </strong>US equities open with solid gains, and the VIX is under 30; the NDX is underperforming, however; the Treasury curve is steeper, with yields higher across the curve ahead of this week’s new 20-year bond auction; the DXY is down, and gold continues to find YTD highs, albeit off highs; positive risk sentiment is supporting crude. The risk-on start to the week is being attributed to positive vaccine updates from Moderna (MRNA), optimism on economies reopening (California is now 75% reopened, its Governor said; tech giant AAPL is also planning to reopen more stores) and hopes of a bounce back (Powell on the weekend said we could see a steady recovery in H2, and that the central bank was not out of ammo). Analysts do now seem to be asking the question of how policymakers will respond if there is a second wave. Stocks in Asia and Europe were higher, although there was caution around Asian semis after US moves aimed at Huawei last week. Some, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/hsbc-warns-that-today-s-risk-on-is-based-on-a-selective-approach-to-news-18-05-2020\">this morning, have warned</a> that traders are taking a selective approach to the news, and ignoring some of the more ‘risk-off’ items.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>All sectors open in positive territory with risk appetite bolstered by positive COVID vaccine updates from Moderna (MRNA). Energy outperforms as it tracks firmer crude prices, industrials also performing well, +~5%. Consumer Staples and Communication Services underperform with the latter weighed on by losses in Google (GOOG) after reports it is expected to receive a number of antitrust lawsuits.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Moderna (MRNA) announced positive interim Phase One data for its MRNA vaccine against COVID-19; three patients on the highest doses had severe but not life-threatening side effects. Note that the initial study was conducted across just eight participants. Phase III study is expected to start in July. Grubhub (GRUB) reportedly rebuffed Uber’s (UBER) latest offer of 1.9 UBER shares for each GRUB share but talks continue, according to WSJ citing sources. Disney (DIS) announced it is to partially reopen its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping site at its Florida resort. Alphabet (GOOG) is likely to receive antitrust lawsuits from the DoJ and a group of state attorney general with a case expected by summer, according to WSJ citing sources. Tesla (TSLA) reportedly told employees that a health official signed off on the safety measures taken at its factory as it restarted production.

Concentration within the equity market has been growing, and while S&amp;P 500 EPS was -14% in Q1, Russell 2000 EPS was -90%. 2) Online platforms and shifting business models will partially offset the revenue declines in in-person consumption, and restrictions have expedited the shift to e-commerce and other online services. 3) The increased costs associated with maintaining or resuming business activity will continue to pressure profit margins, particularly at bricks and mortar corporates. 4) Several companies noted that revenue declines stabilized in April and there were pockets of improvement in early Q2, but the bank warns that while this nascent improvement is encouraging, it likely partially reflects the direct consumer payments under the CARES Act, which may prove temporary. Ahead: GS says understanding the actual pace of economic activity in 2020 will be critical to sizing the downside risk to S&amp;P 500 EPS estimates. The bank maintains its FY 2020 S&amp;P 500 EPS view of USD 110 (-33% Y/Y) and USD 170 for FY21, but adjusts its quarterly path of earnings growth downwards in Q3 and Q4. Looking beyond 2020, GS says investors will remain focused on how quickly lost earnings can be recouped.

Morgan Stanley has recently argued that three factors are helping to dampen volatility: 1) health care advances; President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” feeds into this, with the programme aiming to speed the development of a vaccine via simultaneous testing of different candidates and beginning production before they’ve cleared clinical trials, with hopes of delivering a fully approved vaccine by the end of 2020. 2) monetary policy, which has been quick to respond to COVID, and has over-delivered, backstopping the downside in equities. 3) fiscal policy; while we have seen 3.5 tranches of aid thus far, lawmakers are split on the next package. MS public policy strategists think lawmakers can come together and deliver one more dose of fiscal stimulus, and then hold-off further measures until the November election. The bank’s base case for ‘CARES Part 2’ is for an extension of USD 700bn-1.1trln, while its bull case is for a USD 1.6-2.4trln. However, others note that there does not appear to be any firm consensus on Capitol Hill, and last week, traders noted that Fed Chair Powell again put the onus on fiscal policymakers to deliver more.</p><p><strong>V-SHAPE AND INFLATION:</strong> Many have become sceptical about the notion of a V-shaped economic recovery in the US, however, Morgan Stanley’s equity strategists do, noting that uncertainty is always high in recession, but that a V shape is what history tells us to expect. The bank also notes that many investors are talking about inflation again, and although it may be too early to put the inflation trade on in full today, MS strategists believe that rate sensitive stocks, cyclicals, and small caps tend to show the highest correlation to inflation expectations, while bond proxies and defensive names display the lowest. In the short term, MS still thinks the market needs a breather to work-off some overbought conditions, which it says is a necessary step before resuming a secular bull market. “While concentration is evident in the SPX, it is not alone in driving the market higher,” the bank says, arguing that “pullbacks will provide a good entry point, especially as stock specific risk starts to improve.” The key question, therefore, is how inflationary any rebound will be, and MS says two factors suggest inflation could be in the pipeline: COVID recession will be shorter than GFC, and policymakers response has been quicker and more emphatic.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>SUMMARY: </strong>This week’s testimony by Chair Powell on Tuesday, the meeting minutes from the FOMC’s April confab on Wednesday, and the Fed Listens event to be attended by Powell on Thursday are not likely to reveal much by way of new information, given the proximity of the recent meeting and the subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Powell. Accordingly, the message from these events is likely to be a reiteration that the Fed will take action it deems necessary towards supporting the economy and aiding its bounce back from COVID, although that is not likely to include negative rates at this stage; the Fed is also likely to again call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> You can watch Tuesday’s testimony to the Senate Banking Committee <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/the-quarterly-cares-act-report-to-congress\">here</a> (on 19th May 2020 at 1500 BST/1000 EDT).<strong> </strong>Powell will deliver opening remarks at<strong> </strong>Thursday’s ‘Fed Listens’ event, which will be broadcast via <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/fed-listens-how-is-covid-19-affecting-your-community.htm\">webcast</a> (21st May 2020 at 1930 BST/1430 EDT).</p><p><strong>POWELL TESTIMONY (TUE):</strong> Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will deliver their Quarterly CARES Act Report to Congress on Tuesday at 1000 ET/1500 BST, a transparency requirement. Powell has previously said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed – a strong hint to fiscal policymakers as they debate the next tranche of stimulus. Powell on the weekend said at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. The Fed chair seems to be arguing that further support is crucial to any recovery, and that if policymakers are careful about how the economy is reopened, and people take these social distancing measures forward, then the recovery can begin fairly soon, and job losses seen since mid-March may prove to be temporary; he also argued that, assuming there is no second wave of the coronavirus, the economy will begin to recover steadily through the second half of this year. Also on the economy, Powell stressed that medical metrics are far more important than other economic data, which is currently telling us what we already know, but Powell did state that for the economy to fully recover, Americans will have to be fully confident and that may have to await for the arrival of a vaccine. Powell will likely face questions from Republican lawmakers about how much support is feasible before there are concerns about public finances; Powell is likely to reiterate his argument that now is not the time to think about debt and deficit levels, although fiscal authorities will need to step up eventually. Elsewhere, analysts also say that Powell may be quized about whether US banks should continue paying dividends, after some global authorities recently restricted banks from doing so.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed chair Powell has pushed-back heavily against the idea of negative rates, citing the mixed evidence that exists on its efficacy. However, it is worth noting that a lot of Powell’s language has clearly been structured to leave the option open to the Fed in the future, and other Fed participants (like Kashkari) have also retained this optionality. Such an approach seems sensible, analysts argue; the Fed would be able to exhaust other policy options first before resorting to more aggressive policies. The message, therefore, seems to be that negative rates are not on the radar in the near-term, but the market and policymakers seem to be retaining a non-zero chance of seeing them next year.</p><p><strong>FOMC APRIL MEETING RECAP:</strong> The Fed’s 30th April rate decision was as expected; the federal funds rate target and the interest on excess reserves were left unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and 0.10% respectively. The Fed reiterated its commitment to keep rates at current low levels until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its inflation and labour market goals. One key omission from its statement was references to specific amounts of asset purchases (previously it indicated that it would buy “at least” USD 500bln of Treasuries and at least USD 200bln of MBS); instead, it said it would purchase in amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which might be taken as a pledge for limitless QE until the central bank is confident that its mandates can be met – in his press conference, Chair Powell said the Fed was waiting to see how economic conditions unfold before committing. Some traders were disappointed by the lack of explicit forward guidance within the statement; Powell reiterated that rates would remain low until the economy has ‘weathered’ the COVID impact, echoing the statement. He provided what has become customary warnings about the impending collapse of economic metrics in Q2, as a result of the virus, but thinks that Q3 might see ‘substantial growth’. The Fed chair also emphasised a willingness to do more if required. And in terms of the outlook, Powell identified medium-term risks: the virus and bringing it under control; the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy; the global dimension, where negative data abroad can weigh on the US; Powell believes that the Fed has the policies to address these, but not perfectly. Another key omission was clues about yield curve control; analysts believe that the Fed will need to eventually implement a Japan/Australia style yield curve control policy that keeps a lid on shorter-dated Treasury yields – this policy would be the strong arm to bolster the central bank’s guidance that rates will be kept low. This policy is expected to be hinted at in the months ahead, likely from June, as the Fed gains more clarity on how the virus will play out. Additionally, desks believe that the Fed will continue to taper its (what has been front-loaded) asset purchases (currently running at an average clip of around USD 50bln/week) to something like USD 60-80bln per month (NOTE: this publication is released before the NY Fed update on Friday afternoon, where it may again lower the pace of purchases). However, don’t expect any updates until the aforementioned clarity can be seen; for what it is worth, Powell emphasised that the Fed would not be removing the punch bowl too quickly, or any time soon. One theme that has been in vogue in recent days is negative rates, after some Federal Funds Futures contracts rose above par, signalling a non-zero probability of negative rates ahead; Powell and Co. have heavily leaned-back against this policy tool next week; analysts are of the view that the tool would only be used if the Fed had exhausted all other options.

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>SNAPSHOT:</strong> US stock futures are around 1.5% higher - with the NQ the relative underperformer - and the VIX is easing (though just above 30.0 at pixel time); the Treasury curve is mixed, with short-end yields flat/lower, though longer-end yields are a touch higher, with slight steepening seen ahead of this week’s new 20-year bond auction; the DXY is flat, and gold continues to find YTD highs; positive risk sentiment is supporting crude. The risk-on start to the week is being attributed to optimism on economies reopening (California is now 75% reopened, its Governor said; tech giant AAPL is also planning to reopen more stores) and hopes of a bounce back (Powell on the weekend said we could see a steady recovery in H2, and that the central bank was not out of ammo). Analysts do now seem to be asking the question of how policymakers will respond if there is a second wave. Stocks in Asia and Europe were higher, although there was caution around Asian semis after US moves aimed at Huawei last week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TODAY'S DOCKET: </strong>Not much on the data slate for today; President Trump will participate in a round table with restaurant executives and industry leaders at 2pm ET/7pm London, and will also participate in a video conference with governors on the coronavirus at 4pm ET/9pm London. There are some key events on the docket this week, including more Powell testimony and FOMC minutes, China’s NPC and LPR decision; our week ahead briefing published on Friday can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24545/download\">accessed here</a>, and our central bank briefing can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24546/download\">accessed here</a>. NOTE: Canada is shut today for Victoria Day.</p><p><strong>FED CHAIR POWELL:</strong> There was nothing particularly new for market players in Fed Chair Powell’s Sunday evening remarks. The recent data metrics are clearly being overlooked for now, and Powell stressed that medical metrics were far more important for the US economy; elsewhere, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate a new round of stimulus, Powell suggested that at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. There was a hint of optimism in some of Powell’s remarks: he said “if we are thoughtful and careful about how we reopen the economy so that people take these social distancing measures forward and try to do what we can not to have another outbreak... then the recovery can begin fairly soon,” adding that \"assuming there is not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you will see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year,” and “for the economy to fully recover people will have to be fully confident and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine.” The Fed chair also said that the Fed was not out of ammunition (“not by a long shot”) although again pushed-back on negative rates, and he is confident job losses would be temporary. Powell will testify to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and then speak at a Fed listens event on Thursday. The FOMC’s latest meeting minutes are also on the slate for Wednesday. Powell has spoken a few times in recent weeks, and it is unlikely the Fed chair will have anything new to offer, and as such, his comments are not likely to be a major risk for traders, analysts suggest.</p><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>After the US last week made moves to restrict the supply of US semiconductor chips to Huawei without government approval, there has been little pass through in Asian FX markets at the start of the week, Citi notes, although there has been some volatility in Asian semis. Citi warns that \"scope for Chinese retaliation is now a real risk on the horizon, with the country’s 'unreliable entity list' a possible method of targeting US companies,\" and speculates that China may use laws and rules like Cybersecurity Review Measures and Anti-monopoly Law to investigate and impose restrictions on US firms. \"Most US companies included on China's 'unreliable entity list' may be small-sized firms such as US trading agencies, which will be pushed to the brink of collapse; that could serve as a 'first-level' warning to the US over the Huawei ban before adding bigger companies,\" Citi writes, citing reports in China's Global Times newspaper on Friday.</p><p><strong>Q1 EARNINGS SEASON KEY THEMES: </strong>Goldman Sachs has four observations from Q1 earnings reports: 1) S&amp;P 500 earnings are partially insulated relative to the economy given its large-cap tilt and high weight in non-cyclical industries. Concentration within the equity market has been growing, and while S&amp;P 500 EPS was -14% in Q1, Russell 2000 EPS was -90%. 2) Online platforms and shifting business models will partially offset the revenue declines in in-person consumption, and restrictions have expedited the shift to e-commerce and other online services. 3) The increased costs associated with maintaining or resuming business activity will continue to pressure profit margins, particularly at bricks and mortar corporates. 4) Several companies noted that revenue declines stabilized in April and there were pockets of improvement in early Q2, but the bank warns that while this nascent improvement is encouraging, it likely partially reflects the direct consumer payments under the CARES Act, which may prove temporary. Ahead: GS says understanding the actual pace of economic activity in 2020 will be critical to sizing the downside risk to S&amp;P 500 EPS estimates. The bank maintains its FY 2020 S&amp;P 500 EPS view of USD 110 (-33% Y/Y) and USD 170 for FY21, but adjusts its quarterly path of earnings growth downwards in Q3 and Q4. Looking beyond 2020, GS says investors will remain focused on how quickly lost earnings can be recouped. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-goldman-sachs-sees-four-key-trends-in-q1-earnings-reports-still-sees-fy20-earnings-at-usd-110-but-revises-down-q3-and-q4-estimates-17-05-2020\">More here</a>.</p><p><strong>DAMPENING VOL:</strong> Last week, VIX started off sub-30, saw a high of 40 amid equity downside, before closing out the week in the low 30s. Morgan Stanley has recently argued that three factors are helping to dampen volatility: 1) health care advances; President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” feeds into this, with the programme aiming to speed the development of a vaccine via simultaneous testing of different candidates and beginning production before they’ve cleared clinical trials, with hopes of delivering a fully approved vaccine by the end of 2020. 2) monetary policy, which has been quick to respond to COVID, and has over-delivered, backstopping the downside in equities. 3) fiscal policy; while we have seen 3.5 tranches of aid thus far, lawmakers are split on the next package. MS public policy strategists think lawmakers can come together and deliver one more dose of fiscal stimulus, and then hold-off further measures until the November election. The bank’s base case for ‘CARES Part 2’ is for an extension of USD 700bn-1.1trln, while its bull case is for a USD 1.6-2.4trln. However, others note that there does not appear to be any firm consensus on Capitol Hill, and last week, traders noted that Fed Chair Powell again put the onus on fiscal policymakers to deliver more.</p><p><strong>V-SHAPE AND INFLATION:</strong> Many have become sceptical about the notion of a V-shaped economic recovery in the US, however, Morgan Stanley’s equity strategists do, noting that uncertainty is always high in recession, but that a V shape is what history tells us to expect. The bank also notes that many investors are talking about inflation again, and although it may be too early to put the inflation trade on in full today, MS strategists believe that rate sensitive stocks, cyclicals, and small caps tend to show the highest correlation to inflation expectations, while bond proxies and defensive names display the lowest. In the short term, MS still thinks the market needs a breather to work-off some overbought conditions, which it says is a necessary step before resuming a secular bull market. “While concentration is evident in the SPX, it is not alone in driving the market higher,” the bank says, arguing that “pullbacks will provide a good entry point, especially as stock specific risk starts to improve.” The key question, therefore, is how inflationary any rebound will be, and MS says two factors suggest inflation could be in the pipeline: COVID recession will be shorter than GFC, and policymakers response has been quicker and more emphatic. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-morgan-stanley-thinks-a-v-shape-recovery-and-inflationary-ramp-are-still-possible-17-05-2020\">More here</a>.</p>",

(+0.2%)</strong> were kept afloat after Chinese officials pledged further support including PBoC Governor Yi Gang who reiterated that China will implement more powerful monetary policy and China’s Government Work Report draft also stressed the launching of stronger macro policies. However, the gains were limited by ongoing tensions following the US move to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors and chipsets made using US technology, while India’s <strong>NIFTY (2.3%)</strong> failed to hold on to opening gains with sentiment pressured after India extended the lockdown again to May 31st and surpassed China in the number of coronavirus cases. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially flat with price action kept lacklustre amid the gains in stocks, weak GDP data from Japan and with participants awaiting the 5yr JGB auction which resulted in firmer accepted prices and in turn spurred JGBs upon return from the lunch break.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

Nishimura also suggested that they are looking into additional policy measures and want a solid response in 2nd extra budget. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell reiterated the US will not have negative interest rates and post coronavirus recovery could last through 2021</strong>, while he added the Fed is not out of ammunition and can do more if needed in which he suggested there are no limits to what we can do. Powell added that projections of 20%-25% unemployment peak sounds about right but noted US not at risk of 2nd Great Depression, while he suggested that the Fed and Congress may have more to do to respond to economic fallout from pandemic. Furthermore, Powell stated that companies and families may need 3-6 months more of financial help to avoid insolvency and that the Fed can expand existing programmes or add to new ones, as well as increase purchases as required.

That being said, investors need to juggle COVID-19 and the prospect of escalating protectionism between US and China. Earlier source reports via Nikkei noted TSMC has stopped orders from Huawei, albeit this was downplayed by the chip-company as “market rumours”, adding that it cannot disclose order information. If true, this can mark a major blow to the Chinese telecom and could prompt China’s unveiling of “unreliable entity list”. As a reminder, China’s Global Times’ Chief Editor last week said: “if US further blocks key technology supply to Huawei; will restrict or investigate US companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Cisco and Apple (AAPL), and suspend the purchase of Boeing (BA) planes.” Back to Europe, sentiment seems more driven by Central Bank comments thus far and as economies continue to ease lockdown restrictions, with broad-based gains seen across major indices; albeit, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+1.3%) is the laggard after Italy’s regulator lifted the short-selling carpet ban ahead of schedule and in synchrony with France, Spain, Greece, Belgium, and Austria. Sectors are all in positive territory with the energy sector the outperformer whilst cyclicals outperform defensives – reflecting risk appetite. The breakdown also shows gains led by oil and mining-related sectors, while Travel &amp; Leisure also resides towards the top. In terms of individual movers, Deutsche Telekom (+1.4%) rises with the market but underperforms the DAX (+2.9%) amid reports SoftBank Group is said to be in discussions to sell a large chunk of its T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to Deutsche Telekom. If the transaction is completed, it would boost Deutsche Telekom’s share to over 50%. according to WSJ citing sources. Note: T-Mobile’s largest shareholders are Deutsche Telekom (42.1% stake) and SoftBank (23.8% Stake). Meanwhile, Diageo (+2%) is underpinned by reports Co. is said to be mulling options to delist United Spirits, according to CNBC-TV18 citing sources. Ryanair (+7%) was bolstered post-FY earnings in which it expects a smaller Q2 loss vs. Q1, Co. also boosted its liquidity. Finally, AstraZeneca (+1.4%) outpaces the broader Pharma sector amid reports it will produce as many as 30mln COVID-19 vaccines available to the UK by September if trials are successful. However, FT’s Elder, on the Co. being the largest FTSE 100 by market cap, suggested that such rises “most commonly, feel like a sell signal”.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD -</strong> The non-US Dollars are revelling in a risk on start to the new week, or rather clawing back lost ground amidst high flying precious metals (Gold Usd 1760+ per oz at one stage) and the ongoing revival in crude prices (WTI Usd 31+ and Brent almost Usd 34 per barrel). The Aussie is building a firmer base on the 0.6400 handle and Kiwi is pivoting 0.5950, while the Loonie has rebounded from under 1.4100 even though the DXY remains firm above 100.000 within a 100.470-280 range on the back of gains forged vs ‘safer-havens’ and other G10s with a bigger weighting in the index.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/GBP -</strong> Renewed risk appetite has sapped demand for the Yen relative to the Greenback in the low 107.00 area, but Usd/Jpy looks capped ahead of 107.50 where hefty option expiries reside (2.2 bn), while the Franc remains mixed after comments from SNB’s Maechler noting that the currency would be significantly stronger without increased levels of intervention evident in yet another marked rise in Swiss bank sight deposits. Usd/Chf is currently above 0.9700, but Eur/Chf still eyeing 1.0500 as the Board member also refuted that the round number is a line in the sand akin to the old official 1.2000 floor that was pulled in January 2015. Moreover, the Euro still looks top heavy vs the Buck on ventures through 1.0800 following Fitch cutting France’s AA ratings outlook to negative from stable and also downgrading Austria from positive to stable. Elsewhere, dovish guidance from BoE’s Haldane has added to the Pound’s seasonal weakness, though Cable has rebounded from sub-1.2100 and Eur/Gbp is off 0.8950+ peaks ahead of more from the MPC via Tenreyro with specific focus on any further mention of NIRP.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> No shock to see the Nok, Rub and Mxn welcoming the latest rally in oil, while the Sek is tagging along on broadly bullish risk sentiment and the Try has extended its already impressive recovery to almost 6.8300 vs the Usd after Clearstream and Euroclear both suspended Lira trade on electronic platforms citing a lack of liquidity due to COVID-19 restrictions. On that note, Chinese President Xi will open the World Health Assembly and the Yuan is on a weaker footing in advance of his address and the NPC. Eur/Nok is hovering near 11.0000, Usd/Rub circa 73.0500, Usd/Mxn under 23.9000, Eur/Sek below 10.6400 and Usd/Cnh just shy of 7.1450..</p><p><strong>SNB’s Maechler</strong> acknowledged the CHF’s appreciation, but stated it would have been much more pronounced if we hadn’t been prepared to intervene more heavily; when asked if 1.05 in EUR/CHF was being an informal upper limit responded ‘no, we look at the entire currency situation’. Additionally, rejected the possibility of a special profit payout from the SNB to the Swiss Gov’t given COVID-19. (Newswires/NZZ)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have now breached 138.00, though could not build sufficient steam to challenge last Friday’s 138.40 Liffe session peak before fading at 138.13, while <strong>Bunds</strong> have been unable to keep hold of the 174.00 handle within 174.09-173.42 extremes against the backdrop of an even more pronounced bounce in Italian<strong> BTPs </strong>or lagging French <strong>OATs</strong> after the Fitch outlook downgrade. However, <strong>US long bonds</strong> are the real underperformers as the Treasury curve re-steepens ahead of Wednesday’s substantial 20-year supply, with NAHB and Fed’s Bostic of note for today, plus BoE’s Tenreyro from an EU perspective.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Oil futures continue on their upwards trajectories, aided by a rosier demand prospect as economies reopen and with supply contained by producers. Furthermore, reports via Energy Intel noted that OPEC+ could reportedly extend current production cuts to year-end. The production cuts are to be eased from July according to the original pact. Sticking with OPEC, Saudi and Kuwait also agreed to suspend output at the Khafji field in the neutral zone in June, expected cuts to total 80mln BPD. Meanwhile, Friday’s Baker Hughes Rig Count continued to show receding US drilling activity. <strong>WTI June </strong>and<strong> July</strong> both trade comfortably above USD 30/bbl, with the front-month holding up heading into tomorrow’s June expiry, thus far suggesting subsiding fears of storage scarcity. Despite a lion’s share of open interest and volume in the July contract, participants will be observing the June contract after WTI May fell deep into negative territory heading into its expiration. <strong>Brent July</strong> also remains on the front-foot, towards the top if a USD 32.69-34.00/bbl intraday band. WTI June had risen over WTI July in early trade. <strong>Spot gold</strong> extend its post-Powell gains after the Fed Chair noted that stocks and asset prices could suffer a significant hit and the post coronavirus recovery could last through 2021, while he added the Fed is not out of ammunition and can do more if needed in which he suggested there are no limits to what we can do. The yellow metal sits at an over-seven-year high at USD ~1760/oz (vs. range USD 1743.33-1764.46/oz).<strong> Copper</strong> prices are supported by the overall risk appetite, but the red metal trades within recent ranges. Meanwhile <strong>Dalian Iron</strong> ore rose over 6% at one point amid higher demand prospects with economies and factories reopening.</p>",

That being said, investors need to juggle COVID-19 and the prospect of escalating protectionism between US and China. Earlier source reports via Nikkei noted TSMC has stopped orders from Huawei, albeit this was downplayed by the chip-company as “market rumours”, adding that it cannot disclose order information. If true, this can mark a major blow to the Chinese telecom and could prompt China’s unveiling of “unreliable entity list”. As a reminder, China’s Global Times’ Chief Editor last week said: “if US further blocks key technology supply to Huawei; will restrict or investigate US companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Cisco and Apple (AAPL), and suspend the purchase of Boeing (BA) planes.” Back to Europe, sentiment seems more driven by Central Bank comments thus far and as economies continue to ease lockdown restrictions, with broad-based gains seen across major indices; albeit, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+1.3%) is the laggard after Italy’s regulator lifted the short-selling carpet ban ahead of schedule and in synchrony with France, Spain, Greece, Belgium, and Austria. Sectors are all in positive territory with the energy sector the outperformer whilst cyclicals outperform defensives – reflecting risk appetite. The breakdown also shows gains led by oil and mining-related sectors, while Travel &amp; Leisure also resides towards the top. In terms of individual movers, Deutsche Telekom (+1.4%) rises with the market but underperforms the DAX (+2.9%) amid reports SoftBank Group is said to be in discussions to sell a large chunk of its T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to Deutsche Telekom. If the transaction is completed, it would boost Deutsche Telekom’s share to over 50%. according to WSJ citing sources. Note: T-Mobile’s largest shareholders are Deutsche Telekom (42.1% stake) and SoftBank (23.8% Stake). Meanwhile, Diageo (+2%) is underpinned by reports Co. is said to be mulling options to delist United Spirits, according to CNBC-TV18 citing sources. Ryanair (+7%) was bolstered post-FY earnings in which it expects a smaller Q2 loss vs. Q1, Co. also boosted its liquidity. Finally, AstraZeneca (+1.4%) outpaces the broader Pharma sector amid reports it will produce as many as 30mln COVID-19 vaccines available to the UK by September if trials are successful. However, FT’s Elder, on the Co. being the largest FTSE 100 by market cap, suggested that such rises “most commonly, feel like a sell signal”.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD/CAD - The non-US Dollars are revelling in a risk on start to the new week, or rather clawing back lost ground amidst high flying precious metals (Gold Usd 1760+ per oz at one stage) and the ongoing revival in crude prices (WTI Usd 31+ and Brent almost Usd 34 per barrel). The Aussie is building a firmer base on the 0.6400 handle and Kiwi is pivoting 0.5950, while the Loonie has rebounded from under 1.4100 even though the DXY remains firm above 100.000 within a 100.470-280 range on the back of gains forged vs ‘safer-havens’ and other G10s with a bigger weighting in the index.</p><p>JPY/CHF/EUR/GBP - Renewed risk appetite has sapped demand for the Yen relative to the Greenback in the low 107.00 area, but Usd/Jpy looks capped ahead of 107.50 where hefty option expiries reside (2.2 bn), while the Franc remains mixed after comments from SNB’s Maechler noting that the currency would be significantly stronger without increased levels of intervention evident in yet another marked rise in Swiss bank sight deposits. Usd/Chf is currently above 0.9700, but Eur/Chf still eyeing 1.0500 as the Board member also refuted that the round number is a line in the sand akin to the old official 1.2000 floor that was pulled in January 2015. Moreover, the Euro still looks top heavy vs the Buck on ventures through 1.0800 following Fitch cutting France’s AA ratings outlook to negative from stable and also downgrading Austria from positive to stable. Elsewhere, dovish guidance from BoE’s Haldane has added to the Pound’s seasonal weakness, though Cable has rebounded from sub-1.2100 and Eur/Gbp is off 0.8950+ peaks ahead of more from the MPC via Tenreyro with specific focus on any further mention of NIRP.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - No shock to see the Nok, Rub and Mxn welcoming the latest rally in oil, while the Sek is tagging along on broadly bullish risk sentiment and the Try has extended its already impressive recovery to almost 6.8300 vs the Usd after Clearstream and Euroclear both suspended Lira trade on electronic platforms citing a lack of liquidity due to COVID-19 restrictions. On that note, Chinese President Xi will open the World Health Assembly and the Yuan is on a weaker footing in advance of his address and the NPC. Eur/Nok is hovering near 11.0000, Usd/Rub circa 73.0500, Usd/Mxn under 23.9000, Eur/Sek below 10.6400 and Usd/Cnh just shy of 7.1450..</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have now breached 138.00, though could not build sufficient steam to challenge last Friday’s 138.40 Liffe session peak before fading at 138.13, while <strong>Bunds</strong> have been unable to keep hold of the 174.00 handle within 174.09-173.42 extremes against the backdrop of an even more pronounced bounce in Italian <strong>BTPs</strong> or lagging French <strong>OATs</strong> after the Fitch outlook downgrade. However, US long bonds are the real underperformers as the Treasury curve re-steepens ahead of Wednesday’s substantial 20 year supply, with NAHB and Fed’s Bostic of note for today, plus ECB’s de Cos and BoE’s Tenreyro from an EU perspective.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Oil futures continue on their upwards trajectories</strong>, aided by a rosier demand prospect as economies reopen and with supply contained by producers. Furthermore, reports via Energy Intel noted that OPEC+ could reportedly extend current production cuts to year-end. The production cuts are to be eased from July according to the original pact. Sticking with OPEC, Saudi and Kuwait also agreed to suspend output at the Khafji field in the neutral zone in June, expected cuts to total 80mln BPD. Meanwhile, Friday’s Baker Hughes Rig Count continued to show receding US drilling activity. <strong>WTI</strong> <strong>June</strong> and <strong>July</strong> both trade comfortably above USD 30/bbl, with the front-month holding up heading into tomorrow’s June expiry, thus far suggesting subsiding fears of storage scarcity. Despite a lion’s share of open interest and volume in the July contract, participants will be observing the June contract after WTI May fell deep into negative territory heading into its expiration. <strong>Brent</strong> <strong>July</strong> also remains on the front-foot, towards the top if a USD 32.69-34.00/bbl intraday band. <strong>WTI June had risen over WTI July in early trade.</strong> <strong>Spot gold</strong> extend its post-Powell gains after the Fed Chair noted that stocks and asset prices could suffer a significant hit and the post coronavirus recovery could last through 2021, while he added the Fed is not out of ammunition and can do more if needed in which he suggested there are no limits to what we can do. The yellow metal sits at an over-seven-year high at USD ~1760/oz (vs. range USD 1743.33-1764.46/oz). <strong>Copper</strong> prices are supported by the overall risk appetite, but the red metal trades within recent ranges. Meanwhile <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>Iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> rose over 6% at one point amid higher demand prospects with economies and factories reopening.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>V-SHAPE:</strong> Many have become sceptical about the notion of a V-shaped economic recovery in the US, however, Morgan Stanley’s equity strategists see the possibility, noting that uncertainty is always high in recession, but that a V-shape is what history tells us to expect.</p><p>“Compared to the Financial Crisis, the drop in equity risk premium is right on track, and could fall further, especially given the faster easing of financial conditions this time around,” MS argues. The bank also notes that many investors are talking about inflation again, and although it may be too early to put the inflation trade on in full today, MS strategists believe that rate sensitive stocks, cyclicals, and small caps tend to show the highest correlation to inflation expectations, while bond proxies and defensive names display the lowest. In the short term, MS still thinks the market needs a breather to work-off some overbought conditions, which it says is a necessary step before resuming a secular bull market.</p><p>“While concentration is evident in the SPX, it is not alone in driving the market higher,” the bank says, arguing that “pullbacks will provide a good entry point, especially as stock specific risk starts to improve.”</p><p><strong>INFLATION: </strong>The key question, therefore, is how inflationary any rebound will be, and MS says two factors suggest inflation could be in the pipeline:&nbsp;</p><p>(1) the COVID recession will be a sharper but shorter than the Great financial crisis; “the trigger this time is an exogenous shock in the form of a public health crisis, rather than the classic, endogenous adjustment triggered by rising imbalances, and the GCR also did not start out as a financial crisis, and the banking system is in better shape today than prior to the GFC.”&nbsp;</p><p>(2) the public health crisis has galvanised policymakers to respond quickly. For the first time in a decade, we are finally getting coordinated monetary and fiscal easing – a policy dynamic that is essential to get out of the low-growth, low-inflation loop, MS says. “With the economic shock driving an even deeper wedge between low- and high-income workers, policy-makers are scrutinising ‘trade, tech and titans’ more closely, given its role in driving the wage share of GDP lower and widening the income divide,” adding that “disturbing this trio will also mean disrupting the key structural disinflationary forces of the past 30-years.”</p><p>The bank acknowledges that while consensus remains in the disinflation camp, the driving forces of inflation are already aligned and a regime shift is under way, and the near-term disinflationary trend will quickly give way to reflation and then inflation. MS economists expects global and DM output to reach pre-recession levels in four and eight quarters, respectively, compared with six and fourteen quarters during the GFC.</p>",

Goldman Sachs highlights four key trends from Q1 earnings:</p><ol><li>Earnings are partially insulated versus the economy since high concentration of mega CAPs and high-weight on non-cyclicals (which have posted positive EPS growth in Q1, and expected to post strong growth in the FY). “Concentration within the equity market has been growing. The ongoing crisis has exacerbated the ‘winner-take-al’” nature of the equity market, acutely affecting small companies with less operational and balance sheet flexibility than their larger peers.” Software &amp; Services share of S&amp;P 500 EPS has grown to 9%, led by MSFT, while Health Care and Consumer Staples account for 16% and 7% of S&amp;P 500 EPS, respectively. GS notes that while S&amp;P 500 EPS was -14%, Russell 2000 EPS was -90% in Q1;</li><li>Online platforms and shifting business models will partially offset the revenue declines in in-person consumption, Goldman says, noting that consumer accounts for 70% of the US economy, and has been it by social distancing and shutdowns; sales in the sector excluding AMZN fell by 6% in 1Q and US retail sales fell by 16% in April. “However, restrictions have expedited the shift to e-commerce and other online services,” GS says, noting that online retailer Wayfair (W) reported Q2td gross revenues up 90% Y/Y, TGT reported 275% growth in digital sales MTD through April 23, and CMG reported that, while in-store ordering plunged by 75%, delivery and order-ahead sales surged by 150% and 120%. It also observes that Video chat apps (+1,255%), grocery apps (+134%) and e-commerce apps (+118%) have all more than doubled the number of downloads since last year. And companies – like BBY, for instance – are adjusting business models to reflect new realities;</li><li>S&amp;P 500 net margins fell by 107 bps in Q1, and GS says increased costs associated with maintaining or resuming business activity will continue to pressure profit margins. “Several brick-and-mortar companies (AMZN and TGT, for instance) have highlighted increased costs associated with coronavirus;</li><li>There have been signs among several companies that revenue declines had stabilised in April, and there were some glimpse of improvement in Q2. “Commentary on signs of stabilization was present in a variety of sectors, such as Consumer Discretionary (MAR, BKNG, YUM), Industrials (URI, WM), and IT (FIS, IT, ADP),” GS writes, “several firms leveraged to consumer spending, such as payment processors V, MA, and GPN, even highlighted sequential improvements in April and May.” However, the bank warns that while this nascent improvement is encouraging, it likely partially reflects the direct consumer payments under the CARES Act, which may prove temporary. “But even outside of the consumer, FB noted that after an initial steep decline in March ad revenue was roughly flat during the first three weeks of April vs. the same period a year ago.”</li></ol><p><strong>GS OUTLOOK FOR 2020 AND BEYOND:</strong> Ahead, GS says that understanding the actual pace of economic activity in 2020 will be critical to sizing the downside risk to S&amp;P 500 EPS estimates. “As our economists have highlighted, the divergence between quarter/quarter annualised and year/year real GDP growth has widened, and the expected recovery looks V-shaped on a Q/Q annualised basis (-8%, -39%, +29%, +11%) but U-shaped on a Y/Y basis (-1%, -13%, -7%, -5%). GS maintains its 2020 S&amp;P 500 EPS estimate of USD 110 (-33%) but adjust its quarterly path of earnings growth: “We still expect that Q2 will represent the trough in EPS growth, driven in part by further reserve builds in Financials, but we lift our Q2 growth estimate from -123% to -70% Y/Y given the relative health of several major stocks accounting for 20% of EPS.” And for Q3 it has lowered its EPS growth view to -30% (from -21%) and to -17% in Q4 (from +27%) which reflects a more gradual recovery, and quarterly EPS remaining below 2019 levels for the FY. Beyond, the key is how quickly lost earnings can be recouped.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS BASELINE: </strong>GS’ baseline forecast is for S&amp;P 500 EPS to reach USD 170 in 2021, slightly above 2019’s USD 165. “The recovery would nonetheless be uneven, with EPS in cyclical sectors unlikely to recover to 2019 levels by 2021,” the bank writes, “this would be consistent with our economists’ forecast for real US GDP to reach 2019 levels by the end of 2021.” But the bank has also outlined a downside scenario where S&amp;P 500 EPS could fall to USD 70 this year and reach just USD 115 in 2021: “We envision this downside scenario occurring either because the path to economic normalisation is slower than we now expect or because of lingering economic impact even after the spread has been controlled.”</p>",

(Twitter)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>T-Notes ultimately sold off on Friday with the curve slightly steeper; 2s little changed while 10s and 30s up by a couple of bps. There had initially been a bid in the complex in European trade amid risk off conditions induced by the latest US/Huawei restriction headlines. However, as equity futures began to recoup losses shortly after the US cash equity open, duration came under pressure, reversing the gains from overnight. The move marks a slight paring of the strong bull-flattening seen through the record Treasury refunding auction this week and perhaps was part due to some position unwinding as we head into the weekend. Furthermore, the new USD 20bln 20-year auction looms on the horizon (scheduled for Wednesday), with Friday’s modest rate back-up perhaps some concession ahead of the new coupon for the market to digest. Note also that the Fed cut its daily USTs/TIPS purchases for the week ahead again - USD 6bln from 7bln – but the curve was little changed post the announcement. US T-note futures (M0) settled 3 ticks lower at 139-10+.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell reiterated the US will not have negative interest rates and post coronavirus recovery could last through 2021</strong>, while he added the Fed is not out of ammunition and can do more if needed in which he suggested there are no limits to what we can do. Powell added that projections of 20%-25% unemployment peak sounds about right but noted US not at risk of 2nd Great Depression, while he suggested that the Fed and Congress may have more to do to respond to economic fallout from pandemic. Furthermore, Powell stated that companies and families may need 3-6 months more of financial help to avoid insolvency and that the Fed can expand existing programmes or add to new ones, as well as increase purchases as required. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed Financial Stability Report said the financial sector faces \"significant\" vulnerabilities due to the pandemic, as businesses and households deal with fragile finances for the foreseeable future. Fed added that pandemic strains on household and business balance sheets likely created fragilities that could last for some time, while the banking sector could experience strains due to the economic and financial shocks.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed despite the mostly constructive risk tone, while antipodeans benefit from their high-beta statuses and broad gains across the commodities complex.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price action lacklustre amid the gains in stocks, weak GDP data from Japan and with participants awaiting today’s 5yr JGB auction.</p>",
