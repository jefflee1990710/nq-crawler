The crude benchmarks had another session of double-digit percentage gains, seeing WTI move above 28/bbl and Brent above 34/bbl, as OPEC+ plus North America look set to hold a conference call on Monday with discussion over a 10mln BPD cut, although concerns linger on how committed the US will be to such proposals.

Russian press suggested that OPEC+ will be holding discussions over a potential 10mln BPD reduction, which was later echoed by Russian President Putin himself as well as further source commentary which noted that any deeper reductions would likely require the involvement of producers outside of OPEC+. WSJ sources also reported an OPEC+ scenario of a cut of 10mln BPD that will include North America: Saudi would cut a minimum of 3mln BPD; Russia 1.5mln BPD; US, Canada and Brazil cutting almost 2mln BPD (Texas at least 500k BPD). The WSJ report noted that US producers told OPEC they would voluntarily cut output. Russian President Putin said later in the session Russia’s readiness to act with the US and its desire for joint action; Energy Minister Novak also said it is necessary for production cuts from everybody, including the USA and Saudi, and that he understands the legal limitations the US government has against forcing production cuts but says it must be flexible; added that he sees cuts lasting for only a few months before gradually recovering. Putin and Novak also spoke out against Saudi, where Putin said the Kingdom is planning to get rid of US Shale producers and blamed its withdrawal from the OPEC+ deal for the oil price collapse, while Novak said it is unfortunate that Saudi announced plans to raise production. The Texas regulatory head Sitton spoke on CNBC, saying Texas would support any cuts agreed by President Trump, although echoed Russia’s Novak’s comments that any agreement with OPEC would be temporary. Meanwhile, the latest Baker Hughes US Rig Count (w/e April 3rd) showed Oil -62 at 562, Nat Gas -2 at 100, Total -64 at 664 – further indication of US producers winding down operations amid the price rout.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>US Treasury Mnuchin said they will raise the interest rate on new small business loans to 1.0% from 0.5% to make the loans economic for banks and noted they were working around the clock to get the SBA payment protection program up and running for Friday. Mnuchin added that this doesn't mean businesses will get the loans on Friday, but the program will be up and running, while he stated the first stimulus checks will be directly deposited in 2 weeks which is a week ahead of schedule.

German Finance Minister Scholz said that he has always been a supporter of Eurobonds, however, \"as long as we are so divided within the Eurozone, there will unfortunately be no Eurobonds. Therefore, they are not the short-term solution now.” The comments come ahead of the Eurogroup meeting next Tuesday where finance ministers will aim to establish an EU-wide aid programme, coming after the EC Council failed to. RBC’s analysts weigh in on speculation that there is potential for another European debt crisis if no agreement is made, suggesting that such fears are overdone given the ECB’s asset purchases serving as a backstop to the sovereign bond market, although suggests that the risk of a medium-term political crisis seems more plausible given Italy’s existing weak finances. Meanwhile, Italy is reportedly planning on up to EUR 40bln in new stimulus packages, according to Corriere. Italy is also set to pass emergency income measures worth EUR 3bln, according to a minister.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN RESTRICTIONS: </strong>EU Commission President von der Leyen said discussion are underway with member states to consider how to proceed on border closures after Easter.</p><p><strong>CHINA:</strong> MOFCOM said China supports foreign companies returning to work and will stabilize foreign investment amid the pandemic, while it will further reduce the negative list for foreign investment. There were also comments from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission vice head that they will support local governments to inject capital into small banks and that they welcome foreign, as well as private firms to participate in restructuring of small banks.</p><p><strong>UK:</strong> The UK Treasury expanded the business loan scheme to medium-sized companies in which those with a turnover of GBP 45mln-500mln can apply for government-guaranteed loans of up to GBP 25mln from banks, while it also eased the criteria for small companies under the current program.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US NFP: JOBS REPORT: </strong>The March jobs data was worse than expected, seeing a 701k contraction in nonfarm payrolls, and the jobless rate rising to 4.4% from 3.8%. Analysts noted that it snapped a run of 113 months of job gains. Survey responses were much lower than usual, which leaves the potential for sharp revisions ahead. Additionally, the outlook appears grim, given that the payroll survey period was before many of the announced stay at home orders were issued. The implication is that April's data may be very, very bad. The job losses were concentrated in leisure and hospitality. \"For April, we think payrolls will drop by 14-to-17mln, driving the unemployment rate to 12-to-14%,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics writes. Pantheon also argues that the seemingly robust hourly earnings number also likely was misleading. \"The numbers are not mix-adjusted, so the loss of a large number of relatively low-paid jobs in the hospitality business raised the average hourly earnings of the remaining sample, and it believes that wage growth likely will slow sharply over the coming months.</p><p><strong>ISM NON-MANUFACTURING (Mar.): </strong>The headline print remained in expansionary territory (+50), falling to 52.5 from 57.3, above the consensus 44. New orders however fell to 52.9 from 63.1 and business activity fell into contractionary territory for the first time since July 2009 to 48, although fared better than expected (exp. 45, prev. 57.8). The employment gauge fell to 47 from 55.6 and prices paid fell 0.8pts to 50. The report noted that the Supplier Deliveries Index registered 62.1, up 9.7 points from the February reading of 52.4 and limited the decrease in the composite as&nbsp; the rise as a result of supply related problems as a result of COVID-19; Oxford economics highlights that this kept it from entering contractionary territory. The ISM itself noted “respondents are concerned about the coronavirus impact on the supply chain, operational capacity, human resources and finances, as well as the ramifications for the overall economy”. Ahead, Oxford Economics says that “more pain is in store” the coronavirus shock will see non-manufacturing activity reeling due to the actions in place such as lockdowns and social distancing across the country, thus will impact activity. The desk also notes “an immense pullback in discretionary spending will likely lead to the sharpest quarterly consumer spending contraction on record in Q2.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 8 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-04+.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX bull flattened, catching upward momentum in the US session as equities drifted lower and a cooling in corporate issuance – the -700k NFP report had little immediate market impact. One desk noted that the bid was mostly a function of leveraged fund types, although real money did “nibble”. Furthermore, corporate issuance took a breather on Friday, with just a couple of IG issuers, likely supporting the bid out the curve. FedEx (FDX) was one of the issuers, raising capital further out the curve in order to pay off credit facilities it had drawn down on. This method has become more frequent recently, and is supporting the bounce back in issuance, as corporates raise capital in longer maturities to address their large credit facility drawdowns and commercial paper issuance. Meanwhile, the Fed continued its Treasury purchases (at the reduced clip of USD 60bln per day), also supporting the flattener, and in contrast to recent sessions, Treasuries maintained their bid after the Fed completed its purchases, whereas recent sessions have seen participants selling into the operations. By settlement, 2s -1bps at 0.21%, 10s -4bps at 0.59%, 30s -5bps at 1.22%.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.51% at 2489, NDX -1.41% at 7528, DJIA -1.69% at 21052.5.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Staples +0.54%, Real Estate -0.76%, Health Care -0.96%, Energy -1.34%, Consumer Discretionary -1.47%, Industrials -1.55%, Technology -1.65%, Communication Svs. -2.2%, Financials -2.23%, Materials -2.34%, Utilities -3.62%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) lower after Credit Suisse cuts PT, citing prolonged COVID-19 closures and lockdowns weighing on demand (MS also cut its PT); it will also be keeping US retail stores closed until May. Disney (DIS) was lower after announcing it will furlough workers. Tesla (TSLA) surged after revealing better than expected Q1 deliveries. 3M (MMM) came under pressure amid a hostile tweet from US President Trump who stated the co. “will have a big price to pay” after being hit hard by the Trump administration to see what it is doing with its masks. Boeing (BA) announced it is to temporarily suspend operations at its Philadelphia, Ridley Township facilities for two weeks. American Airlines (AAL) is to further reduce flights with April flights being cut between 70-75% and around 80% in May as demand plummets amid the coronavirus. Constellation Brands (STZ) beat on EPS and revenue. Incyte (INCY) announced it is working with FDA to initiate a Phase 3 trial of its Ruxoloitnib (Jakafi) plus standard of care therapy (SoC), compared to SoC alone, as a treatment for patients with coronavirus. Twitter (TWTR) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Goldman Sachs. Kraft Heinz (KHC) CEO stated business in China is now returning to normality, has drawn down USD 4bln of its revolving credit line but cash flow and liquidity are strong.</p><h2>WEEKLY FOREX WRAP</h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The Buck began the week in modest recovery mode amidst end of March/Q1/FY 2019/20 buying signals from various rebalancing models, but gradually picked up momentum as rival currencies, especially EMs, were hit harder by the accelerating and in some cases exponential rise of the coronavirus. Indeed, the Greenback was only marginally and temporarily ruffled by bad US economic news in the guise of another record peak in initial claims (6.648 mn and twice the previous all time high clocked last Thursday) and headline payrolls blowing away consensus (-701k vs -100k forecast), even though the monthly BLS survey stopped counting the number of non-farm workers without a job on March 12. The DXY has now reclaimed 100.000+ status and rebounded through a couple of technical hurdles on the way including 100.631 that represented a 50% Fib retracement of the pull-back from ytd peak (102.999) to March 27 low (98.270), but has run in to more resistance ahead of the next psychological/round number at 100.850 despite upgrades to final Markit PMIs and the headline services ISM returning to growth from contraction.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Friday’s G10 laggard, as Cable finally gave up trying to grasp the 1.2500 handle after several attempts aided by positive Eur/Gbp cross flows and short covering of Sterling positions in general from oversold levels. A weak UK services PMI did not help the Pound, but the aforementioned Dollar revival was also instrumental in the eventual retreat through 1.2400, 1.2300 and nearest support at last Friday’s 1.2245 low, with COVID-19 cases and fatalities expected to mount into the Easter weekend at least.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency has also been plagued by the pandemic and only tentative or formative signs that the crisis situation may be reaching a plateau in Italy, with Spain not far from the epicentre, while Eurozone services PMIs were particularly downbeat on top of yet more grim GDP projections. Eur/Usd has duly reversed sharply from circa 1.1143 at one stage and is now vulnerable to losing chart support in the form a Fib retracement protecting 1.0700 and the 2020 base at 1.0636 from March 23rd.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD:</strong> Extreme volatility is apt to describe trade for the Kiwi and Aussie between 0.6062-0.5844 and 0.6213-0.5981 respective parameters against their US counterpart, but with bounces getting shallower over the course of the week even though the RBNZ and RBA alongside Governments down under pumped more money into the system in concerted efforts to buffer economies and financial sectors from the nCoV fallout. Moreover, the Fed unfurled its 7th repo-style Usd liquidity provision via a FIMA, but even this only gave other currencies transitory relief. However, the Loonie has fared better within a 1.4348-1.3983 range on the back of a late week resurgence in crude prices following US President Trump’s intervention to stop oil plunging via a call to Saudi Arabian and Russian officials that prompted the former to convene an emergency OPEC+ meeting, scheduled for Monday, but only if all parties can agree on the agenda beforehand.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY:</strong> The non-Usd safe havens are on course to end the week in lock-step and both close to new lows vs the Buck around 108.45 and 0.9770, but the Yen has displayed more of its intrinsic properties especially over the turn of the month when Japanese exporters were selling Usd/Jpy and repatriation offset seasonal demand for the Greenback.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK:</strong> Norwegian and Swedish macro fundamentals have been decidedly bearish, including a spike in jobless and sub-50 PMIs, but the Crowns have broadly appreciated on bullish technical, direct Norges Bank intervention and a still resilient Riksbank in terms of standard monetary easing over expanding QE, not to mention the independent Euro weakness mentioned above.</p><p><strong>EM:</strong> Notwithstanding some deviation and traction from underlying commodities (ie crude and Gold rushing back over Usd1600/oz compared to Usd1560 or so at the other extreme), regional currencies have been under intense pressure, if not quite to the point of collapse under capital flight. Nevertheless, several have slumped to fresh all time or multi-month lows, like the Zar after losing its last non-junk status rating, the Mxn and Brl on grave concerns that the coronavirus will be the last straw for nations already struggling to cope with structural and financial problems. Meanwhile, the Yuan did not get a fillip from the latest PBoC RRR cut for certain banks after it set the Usd/Cny midpoint at an 11-year high.</p>",

One desk noted that the bid was mostly a function of leveraged fund types, although real money did “nibble”. Furthermore, corporate issuance took a breather on Friday, with just a couple of IG issuers, likely supporting the bid out the curve. FedEx (FDX) was one of the issuers, raising capital further out the curve in order to pay off credit facilities it had drawn down on. This method has become more frequent recently, and is supporting the bounce back in issuance, as corporates raise capital in longer maturities to address their large credit facility drawdowns and commercial paper issuance. Meanwhile, the Fed continued its Treasury purchases (at the reduced clip of USD 60bln per day), also supporting the flattener, and in contrast to recent sessions, Treasuries maintained their bid after the Fed completed its purchases, whereas recent sessions have seen participants selling into the operations. By settlement, 2s -1bps at 0.21%, 10s -4bps at 0.59%, 30s -5bps at 1.22%.</li></ul>",

Russian press suggested that OPEC+ will be holding discussions over a potential 10mln BPD reduction, which was later echoed by Russian President Putin himself as well as further source commentary which noted that any deeper reductions would likely require the involvement of producers outside of OPEC+. WSJ sources also reported an OPEC+ scenario of a cut of 10mln BPD that will include North America: Saudi would cut a minimum of 3mln BPD; Russia 1.5mln BPD; US, Canada and Brazil cutting almost 2mln BPD (Texas at least 500k BPD). The WSJ report noted that US producers told OPEC they would voluntarily cut output. Russian President Putin said later in the session Russia’s readiness to act with the US and its desire for joint action; Energy Minister Novak also said it is necessary for production cuts from everybody, including the USA and Saudi, and that he understands the legal limitations the US government has against forcing production cuts but says it must be flexible; added that he sees cuts lasting for only a few months before gradually recovering. Putin and Novak also spoke out against Saudi, where Putin said the Kingdom is planning to get rid of US Shale producers and blamed its withdrawal from the OPEC+ deal for the oil price collapse, while Novak said it is unfortunate that Saudi announced plans to raise production. The Texas regulatory head Sitton spoke on CNBC, saying Texas would support any cuts agreed by President Trump, although echoed Russia’s Novak’s comments that any agreement with OPEC would be temporary. Meanwhile, the latest Baker Hughes US Rig Count (w/e April 3rd) showed Oil -62 at 562, Nat Gas -2 at 100, Total -64 at 664 – further indication of US producers winding down operations amid the price rout.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck began the week in modest recovery mode amidst end of March/Q1/FY 2019/20 buying signals from various rebalancing models, but gradually picked up momentum as rival currencies, especially EMs, were hit harder by the accelerating and in some cases exponential rise of the coronavirus. Indeed, the Greenback was only marginally and temporarily ruffled by bad US economic news in the guise of another record peak in initial claims (6.648 mn and twice the previous all time high clocked last Thursday) and headline payrolls blowing away consensus (-701k vs -100k forecast), even though the monthly BLS survey stopped counting the number of non-farm workers without a job on March 12. The <strong>DXY</strong> has now reclaimed 100.000+ status and rebounded through a couple of technical hurdles on the way including 100.631 that represented a 50% Fib retracement of the pull-back from ytd peak (102.999) to March 27 low (98.270), but has run in to more resistance ahead of the next psychological/round number at 100.850 despite upgrades to final Markit PMIs and the headline services ISM returning to growth from contraction.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Friday’s G10 laggard, as Cable finally gave up trying to grasp the 1.2500 handle after several attempts aided by positive Eur/Gbp cross flows and short covering of Sterling positions in general from oversold levels. A weak UK services PMI did not help the Pound, but the aforementioned Dollar revival was also instrumental in the eventual retreat through 1.2400, 1.2300 and nearest support at last Friday’s 1.2245 low, with COVID-19 cases and fatalities expected to mount into the Easter weekend at least.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has also been plagued by the pandemic and only tentative or formative signs that the crisis situation may be reaching a plateau in Italy, with Spain not far from the epicentre, while Eurozone services PMIs were particularly downbeat on top of yet more grim GDP projections. Eur/Usd has duly reversed sharply from circa 1.1143 at one stage and is now vulnerable to losing chart support in the form a Fib retracement protecting 1.0700 and the 2020 base at 1.0636 from March 23rd.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>Extreme volatility is apt to describe trade for the Kiwi and Aussie between 0.6062-0.5844 and 0.6213-0.5981 respective parameters against their US counterpart, but with bounces getting shallower over the course of the week even though the RBNZ and RBA alongside Governments down under pumped more money into the system in concerted efforts to buffer economies and financial sectors from the nCoV fallout. Moreover, the Fed unfurled its 7th repo-style Usd liquidity provision via a FIMA, but even this only gave other currencies transitory relief. However, the Loonie has fared better within a 1.4348-1.3983 range on the back of a late week resurgence in crude prices following US President Trump’s intervention to stop oil plunging via a call to Saudi Arabian and Russian officials that prompted the former to convene an emergency OPEC+ meeting, scheduled for Monday, but only if all parties can agree on the agenda beforehand.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The non-Usd safe havens are on course to end the week in lock-step and both close to new lows vs the Buck around 108.45 and 0.9770, but the Yen has displayed more of its intrinsic properties especially over the turn of the month when Japanese exporters were selling Usd/Jpy and repatriation offset seasonal demand for the Greenback.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Norwegian and Swedish macro fundamentals have been decidedly bearish, including a spike in jobless and sub-50 PMIs, but the Crowns have broadly appreciated on bullish technical, direct Norges Bank intervention and a still resilient Riksbank in terms of standard monetary easing over expanding QE, not to mention the independent Euro weakness mentioned above.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding some deviation and traction from underlying commodities (ie crude and Gold rushing back over Usd1600/oz compared to Usd1560 or so at the other extreme), regional currencies have been under intense pressure, if not quite to the point of collapse under capital flight. Nevertheless, several have slumped to fresh all time or multi-month lows, like the Zar after losing its last non-junk status rating, the Mxn and Brl on grave concerns that the coronavirus will be the last straw for nations already struggling to cope with structural and financial problems. Meanwhile, the Yuan did not get a fillip from the latest PBoC RRR cut for certain banks after it set the Usd/Cny midpoint at an 11 year high.</p>",

Shares in China were down around 0.5%. The European Stoxx 50 is off by around 0.5%. US futures are slightly firmer after earlier losses.</p><p><strong>MACRO: </strong>Treasuries are mixed, with major curve spreads little changed (modest bias towards flattening). Oil has already seen a choppy session, rising into positive territory after losses of around 6% overnight after reports OPEC+ is mulling production cuts; crude will remain in focus ahead of an OPEC+ video conference on Monday; Trump will also be meeting oil execs at the White House on Friday afternoon. The latest OPEC reports suggest scenarios include 10mln BPD cuts to include North America, while Saudi would cut a minimum of 3mln BPD, Russia 1.5mln BPD and US, Canada and Brazil to cut almost 2mln bpd, according to WSJ sources. However, the IEA stated an OPEC+ 10mln BPD cut is not sufficient enough to balance the oil market.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy names trade higher on optimism about global production cuts. While reports suggest US shale producers (XOM, COP, CVX, OXY) have launched a campaign in support of new sanctions against Saudi Arabia and Russia, urging the White House to make sure the oil production nations cut output to see a rise in crude prices, according to the Financial Times. Meanwhile, separate reports citing a senior US administration official note US President Trump will not ask US oil companies for a coordinated production cut to help stabilise oil markets. Reminder, President Trump is to meet with US oil executives later on today.</p><p><strong>US STOCK NEWS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) lower after Credit Suisse cuts PT, citing prolonged Covid closures and lockdowns weighing on demand (MS also cut its PT); it will also be keeping US retail stores closed until May. Disney (DIS) is lower after announcing it will furlough workers. Tesla (TSLA) is surging after revealing better than expected Q1 deliveries. 3M (MMM) under pressure after a hostile tweet from US President Trump who stated the co. “will have a big price to pay” after being hit hard by the Trump administration to see what it is doing with its masks. Boeing (BA) announced it is to temporarily suspend operations at its Philadelphia, Ridley Township facilities for two weeks. American Airlines (AAL) is to further reduce flights with April flights being cut between 70-75% and around 80% in May as demand plummets amid the coronavirus. Constellation Brands (STZ) firmer after earnings. Incyte (INCY) announced it is working with FDA to initiate a Phase 3 trial of its Ruxoloitnib (Jakafi) plus standard of care therapy (SoC), compared to SoC alone, as a treatment for patients with coronavirus. Twitter (TWTR) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Goldman Sachs.</p><p><strong>FED PURCHASES: </strong>The Fed will again be buying USD 60bln of Treasuries/TIPS on Friday, down from the USD 75bln on Monday-Wednesday.<strong> </strong>Full schedule and purchase amounts can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-tips-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-3rd-april-2020-03-04-2020\">accessed here</a>.</p><p><strong>JOBS REPORT: T</strong>he March jobs data was worse than expected, seeing a 701k contraction in nonfarm payrolls, and the jobless rate rising to 4.4% from 3.8%. Analysts noted that it snapped a run of 113 months of job gains. Survey responses were much lower than usual, which leaves the potential for sharp revisions ahead. Additionally, the outlook appears grim, given that the payroll survey period was before many of the announced stay at home orders were issued. The implication is that April's data may be very, very bad. The job losses were concentrated in leisure and hospitality. \"For April, we think payrolls will drop by 14-to-17mln, driving the unemployment rate to 12-to-14%,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics writes. Pantheon also argues that the seemingly robust hourly earnings number also likely was misleading. \"The numbers are not mix-adjusted, so the loss of a large number of relatively low-paid jobs in the hospitality business raised the average hourly earnings of the remaining sample, and it believes that wage growth likely will slow sharply over the coming months.</p><p><strong>FLOWS: </strong>Bank of America’s highly watched weekly gauge of flows reported USD 8.1bln of inflows into equities in the week, amid a chunky USD 27.1bln of bond outflows, and a record USD 194.2bln into cash. Flows into US stocks were modest at USD 4.1bln the bank said. In its commentary, the bank said it was tough for asset prices and&nbsp; volatility to subside until traders can safely leave their homes; but the bank argues that the low in stock prices has been seen: the magnitude of the stock crash (over 2 trillion dollars in market cap wiped off) suggests the bulk of the selling behind us. BofA notes the speed by which policymakers have responded, unlike historical episodes. BofA says \"EPS in collapse but SPX 2150 low justified via -25% drop in EPS to $120 and a policy-success PE of 17.5x\". The bank says the playbook for April assumes the SPX will hold 2350, and suggests buying growth (tech, pharma, biotech, staples -- companies that improve quality and quantity of health and education). It also suggests buying quality, and \"humiliation\" (the best stocks in distressed sectors, i.e., 'the best house in the worst neighbourhood').</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets were mostly lower as the region failed to sustain the energy-led euphoria from Wall St where risk appetite was driven by the record surge in oil prices </strong>after comments from President Trump spurred hopes of a potential Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price truce, in which he noted that he spoke to the Saudi Crown Prince who spoke with Russian President Putin and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10mln-15mln BPD. Nonetheless, the momentum lost steam overnight given Russia’s denial of any talks occurring between President Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince, with key data releases including Chinese Caixin PMIs and looming US NFPs adding to the cautiousness. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.7%)</strong> gave up early gains as the initial surge in the energy sector reversed course and amid continued weakness in financials, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (U/C)</strong> also deteriorated after failing to hold above the 18000 level. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%)</strong> conformed to the overnight indecision as participants digested the latest PMI releases from China in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates and Composite PMI improved, although both remained in contraction territory with the former at its 2nd weakest reading on record. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured as Japanese stocks initially traded positive and following the BoJ’s Rinban announcement in which it lowered purchases in the short-end, although this wasn’t much of a surprise given the increased frequency of purchases for this month and JGBs later rebounded off lows as the risk appetite waned.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

European sectors mostly with energy faring the worst amid yesterday’s pullback in energy prices, although financials stand as the marked laggard, whilst healthcare names outperform – potentially on the back of heavyweight Novartis (+1.6%) after the Co. announced it plans to initiate Phase III clinical trials to evaluate the use of Jakavi for treating a severe immune overreaction in coronavirus patient. In terms of individual movers, Tullow Oil (+25%) sees significant upside after noting it remains on production target, whilst shares also see tailwinds from the rising energy prices. H&amp;M (+3.7%) rises after Q1 products were considerable above forecasts, whilst revenue, group sales and online sales saw YY increases – albeit the Co. warned that losses will be seen in Q2 amid material negative virus impacts. Adidas (-3.8%) falls amid reports the Co. is seeking EUR 1-2bln in government aid due to the fallout from COVID-19. Remy Cointreau (-2.6%) is similar subdued as the virus is to cause steeper Q1 2020 losses than the -26% YY figure seen in Q4 2019.&nbsp; State-side, Tesla shares rose some 18% after-market after Q1 deliveries topped estimates and its Shanghai factory achieved record production.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar is back in the ascendancy after Thursday’s oil-induced stumble and regaining momentum as most other currencies flounder amidst the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and economic fallout evident in services PMIs. The DXY has extended above 100.000 and currently probing a relatively key upside chart level at 100.631 (50% retracement from 102.999 ytd peak to recent 98.270 trough) in the run up to NFP, the final US Markit PMI and non-manufacturing ISM.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD -</strong> The biggest G10 losers, with Sterling succumbing to all round selling pressure in wake of the weaker than prelim UK services PMI that nudged the composite reading further below 50.0 and pushing Cable back under 1.2400 then 1.2300 to circa 1.2263, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded to 0.8800 from around 0.8740 even though the Eurozone surveys were even bleaker, Spain and Italy in particular. Meanwhile, the Aussie and Kiwi have handed back all their recovery gains from 0.6075 and 0.5900+ to sub-0.6000 and almost 0.5850 despite slightly firmer than forecast Australian retail sales overnight and another PBoC RRR cut that has not helped the Yuan either (Usd/Cnh just under 7.1200 vs 7.1115 Usd/Cnh fix – highest midpoint since March 2008).</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/EUR/JPY -</strong> Also losing more ground vs the Greenback, as the Franc slips towards 0.9800 where a 1.1 bn option expiry resided and Loonie hands back gains forged from yesterday’s crude price spike within a 1.4208-1.4116 range. Meanwhile, the aforementioned dire Eurozone services PMIs and composite prints have precipitated a further pull-back in Eur/Usd to sub-1.0800 and the Yen has reversed from 108.00+ all the way back above the 200 DMA (108.33).</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK -</strong> In contrast to their major counterparts, more upside for the Scandinavian Kronas as oil returns to the boil ahead of Monday’s hastily convened OPEC+ meeting to discuss an output cut and the Riksbank continues to rule out a repo reduction in favour of any other monetary stimulus that may be deemed necessary. On that note, more should be forthcoming after Sweden’s services sector slumped into contractionary territory alongside manufacturing in March, while Norway’s jobless rate jumped nigh on 5-fold to 10.7%, though not quite as high as anticipated (consensus 13.5%).

Thereafter, the complex was bolstered in early EU trade as OPEC+ seemingly edges closer to a platform for discussions – with a webinar meeting to take place on Monday, as according to the Azeri Oil Minister. That being said, Russian President Putin still has not given any mandate to the Russian Energy Ministry to cut output, according to EnergyIntel's Bakr; additionally, Energy Minister Novak’s attendance is yet to be confirmed. Sources via WSJ’s Summer Said noted that Russia is not likely to agree to output cuts if US does not also curb production. On that front, US administration official said the US doesn't know formal details of Saudi and Russian plans to cut oil supply and that US President Trump doesn't plan to ask domestic producers to agree on a specific cut. Furthermore, in-fitting with prior sources, OPEC+ is reportedly mulling inviting the US and Canada to Monday's call and OPEC plus cuts will depend on US efforts, with a crude curtailment of 10mln being considered. Yesterday, a Saudi official reportedly stated a best-case scenario would be, maybe a 6mln BPD cut. All-in-all, despite the lack of concrete commitment or quota allocations, crude markets are bolstered on hopes of a coordinated action from key global energy producers – prices will likely sway with incoming headlines throughout the day.&nbsp;<strong>WTI&nbsp;front-month futures</strong> reside around USD 26.50/bbl having tested USD 27/bbl to the upside ahead of yesterday’s USD 27.39/bbl high.&nbsp;<strong>Brent&nbsp;</strong>Jun’20 meanwhile outperforms and nudges higher towards USD 33/bbl, having eclipsed USD 36/bbl to the upside in the prior session. Something to keep an eye on - SGH Macro reports (last night) that Chinese sources dispute speculation in markets that China has purchased large quantities of crude in recent days, which follows reports that China is in the market for cheap oil; thus, opening the door to speculation as the country does not publish its free emergency stockpiling data. Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>spot&nbsp;gold</strong>&nbsp;remains uneventful just north of USD 1600/oz, having clocked in a tight range of USD 1606.60-1618.27/bbl thus far. Gains in&nbsp;<strong>copper&nbsp;</strong>remain capped at USD 2.25/lb as the red metal tracks movement in stocks.</p><p><strong>OPEC+ preparing for a meeting, which could potentially occur next week, according to Tass. </strong>(Newswires) Later reports noted that this will likely take place via teleconference Monday 6th April 6th. (Twitter) Russian press suggested that OPEC+ will be holding discussions over a potential 10mln BPD reduction (no set quotas yet), which was later echoed by further source commentary which also noted that any deeper reductions would likely require the involvement of producers outside of OPEC+. Note, Russia are yet to confirm their attendance to the call and President Putin has not given any mandate to the Energy Ministry to lower production. WSJ suggests that OPEC+ is considering inviting US and Canada on to the call, depending on US efforts.</p><p><strong>Global output cut of 10mln BPD is a realistic goal, according to an OPEC+ delegate.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he did not make concessions during talks with Saudi and Russia on oil, while he added that he did not agree to a US domestic production cut</strong>.

Something to keep an eye on - SGH Macro reports (last night) that Chinese sources dispute speculation in markets that China has purchased large quantities of crude in recent days, which follows reports that China is in the market for cheap oil; thus, opening the door to speculation as the country does not publish its free emergency stockpiling data. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains uneventful just north of USD 1600/oz, having clocked in a tight range of USD 1606.60-1618.27/bbl thus far. Gains in <strong>copper</strong> remain capped at USD 2.25/lb as the red metal tracks movement in stocks.</p>",

Perhaps pre-NFP caution has prevailed over temptation to push the boundaries higher or the latest advances in oil and relative calm in risk assets/sentiment is contributing to defensive trade and positioning. Also ahead, final Markit services PMI and non-manufacturing ISM with forward-looking components that way well offer more than the US jobs data in terms of how bad COVID-19 is weighing on the economy, especially as the BLS cut-off was early in March like ADP.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets were mostly lower as the region failed to sustain the energy-led euphoria from Wall St where risk appetite was driven by the record surge in oil prices </strong>after comments from President Trump spurred hopes of a potential Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price truce, in which he noted that he spoke to the Saudi Crown Prince who spoke with Russian President Putin and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10mln-15mln BPD. Nonetheless, the momentum lost steam overnight given Russia’s denial of any talks occurring between President Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince, with key data releases including Chinese Caixin PMIs and looming US NFPs adding to the cautiousness. <strong>ASX 200 (-2.2%)</strong> gave up early gains as the initial surge in the energy sector reversed course and amid continued weakness in financials, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.7%)</strong> also deteriorated after failing to hold above the 18000 level. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.0%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%)</strong> conformed to the overnight indecision as participants digested the latest PMI releases from China in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates and Composite PMI improved, although both remained in contraction territory with the former at its 2nd weakest reading on record. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured as Japanese stocks initially traded positive and following the BoJ’s Rinban announcement in which it lowered purchases in the short-end, although this wasn’t much of a surprise given the increased frequency of purchases for this month and JGBs later rebounded off lows as the risk appetite waned.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, price action was uneventful ahead of the key US jobs data with the <strong>DXY</strong> plateauing above the 100.00 level to hold on to most the prior day’s strength. The greenback’s major counterparts were lacklustre in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated around 1.0850 and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> contained again by resistance at 1.2400, as well as the cluster of moving average levels ranging from its 5- to 100-Hourly MAs. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was slightly higher but struggled to gain a solid footing on the 108.00 handle, while antipodeans were flat with firmer than expected Australian Retail Sales data and the weakest PBoC reference rate setting since the global financial crisis doing little to spur a reaction in the currencies.</p><p>Australian Retail Sales MM (Feb) 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. -0.3%). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed as oil prices continued to pullback from the prior day’s record surged which has been triggered after comments from US President Trump spurred hopes of a Saudi-Russia oil price truce with a possible 10mln-15mln bpd cut which saw <strong>WTI</strong> briefly test the USD 27.00/bbl level before retracing some of the advances to settle above USD 25/bbl with gains of around 25%. However, prices continued to pullback after several reports pushed back on an imminent deal including comments from the Kremlin which denied discussions occurred between Saudi and Russian leadership. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were steady after its recent reclaim of the USD 1600/oz level and amid an uneventful greenback, while copper prices were marginally pressured as the risk appetite soured overnight.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he did not make concessions during talks with Saudi and Russia on oil, while he added that he did not agree to a US domestic production cut</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>US Department of Energy announced it is offering oil producers the option to lease space to store oil in the SPR, in fitting with source reports earlier in the week and is to lease space for 30mln bbls of oil. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US administration official said the US doesn't know formal details of Saudi and Russian plans to cut oil supply and that US President Trump doesn't plan to ask domestic producers to agree on a specific cut.</strong> The official also commented that the US cannot orchestrate a mandated domestic oil supply cut and that US companies are already cutting production as they run out of storage space, while the US government is considering suspending royalty payments on oil production to support domestic suppliers. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia reportedly wants other producers such as the US, Canada, Mexico and others in G20 to take part in any cuts according to sources,</strong> while a Saudi official reportedly stated a best case scenario would be, maybe a 6mln BPD cut and added that they were not sure how he President Trump reached those figures or which countries he has in mind.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX was little changed amid a choppy session, albeit tight ranges. Futures spiked higher overnight on the announcement the Fed would be suspending USTs and Federal Deposits from the supplementary leverage ratio, supporting banks in maintaining onto Treasuries, although faded the move during APAC trade. Furthermore, similar to Wednesday’s tape action, the complex was sold into the afternoon where the Fed resumed its Treasury purchases, albeit at a smaller clip of USD 60bln per day (down from USD 75bln), which was likely an influencing factor behind the higher offer-to-cover ratios; a crude spike induced rally in equities likely supported the offer in Treasuries too. Note the curve sold off in a steepener fashion after the Fed carried out its long-end purchases first, as it has been doing in prior sessions, before moving up the curve. The corporate issuance bonanza continued with around ten IG issuers coming to the dollar market, including a USD 19bln 5-parter (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s) for its Sprint (S) merger. Signs of a healthier corporate debt market have been felt at the front-end too, where the NY Fed noted AA-rated CP spreads continue to decline; the USD 3-month FRA-OIS spread narrowed by 8bps to 113bps on the session. Looking at the T-Curve at settlement, yields were little changed, with yields within 2bps higher/lower. T-note (M0) futures settled 3 ticks lower at 138-28+.</p><p>US Fed total balance sheet size increased to USD 5.86tln on Wednesday from USD 5.30tln the prior week, while Fed holdings of Treasuries rose to USD 3.34tln from USD 2.98tln W/W and its holdings of MBS rose to USD 1.46tln from USD 1.38tln W/W.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly lower as the region failed to sustain the energy-led euphoria from Wall St where risk appetite was driven by the record surge in oil prices after comments from President Trump spurred hopes of a potential Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price truce, in which he noted that he spoke to the Saudi Crown Prince who spoke with Russian President Putin and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10mln-15mln BPD. Nonetheless, the momentum lost steam overnight given Russia’s denial of any talks occurring between President Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince, with key data releases including Chinese Caixin PMIs and looming US NFPs adding to the cautiousness. ASX 200 (-2.2%) gave up early gains as the initial surge in the energy sector reversed course and amid continued weakness in financials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) also deteriorated after failing to hold above the 18000 level. Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) conformed to the overnight indecision as participants digested the latest PMI releases from China in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates and Composite PMI improved, although both remained in contraction territory with the former at its 2nd weakest reading on record. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured as Japanese stocks initially traded positive and following the BoJ’s Rinban announcement in which it lowered purchases in the short-end, although this wasn’t much of a surprise given the increased frequency of purchases for this month and JGBs later rebounded off lows as the risk appetite waned.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with the region partially benefitting from the energy-led momentum on Wall St where risk appetite was driven by the record surge in oil prices after comments from President Trump spurred hopes of a potential Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price truce in which he noted that he spoke to the Saudi Crown Prince who spoke with Russian President Putin and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10mln-15mln BPD. Nonetheless, the momentum lost some steam overnight given Russia’s denial of any talks occurring between President Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince, with key data releases including Chinese Caixin PMIs and looming US NFPs adding to the cautiousness. ASX 200 (-0.5%) is choppy as the initial surge in the energy sector reverses course and amid continued weakness for financials, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is just about kept afloat by recent JPY outflows but off intraday highs after failing to hold above the 18000 level. Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) also conform to the overnight indecisiveness as participants digest the latest PMI releases from China in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates and Composite PMI improved, although both remained in contraction territory with the former at its 2nd weakest reading on record.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is uneventful ahead of the key US jobs data with the DXY plateauing above the 100.00 level to hold on to most the prior day’s strength despite the surge in Initial Jobless Claims which roughly doubled to about 6.6mln. The greenbacks major counterparts are also lacklustre with EUR/USD consolidating around 1.0850 and GBP/USD contained again by resistance at 1.2400 and amongst a cluster of moving average levels ranging from the 5- to 100-Hourly MAs. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is slightly higher but struggles to gain a solid footing on the 108.00 handle, while antipodeans are flat with firmer than expected Australian Retail Sales data and the weakest PBoC reference rate setting since the global financial crisis doing little to spur a reaction in the currencies.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as Japanese stocks remain positive and following the BoJ’s Rinban announcement in which it lowered purchases in the short-end, although this wasn’t much of a surprise given the increased frequency of purchases for this month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
