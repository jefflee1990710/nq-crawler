However, it did say that there were rising risks from abroad, and intimated that it may ease at the October meeting. Analysts at Oxford Economics say it will be contingent on if global growth slows further, which will lead to other central banks loosening their policy strings, which could have the impact of strengthening the JPY. “We believe a policy rate cut would be the most likely action, accompanied by offsetting measures to limit the adverse side effects from even more negative rates.” It is also noteworthy that, bond yields and exchange rates have been little effected by the FOMC and ECB dovish actions, OxEco observes, and while US/China trade tensions shook up markets in August, sending bond yields lower – Japanese yields fell beneath the BOJ’s lower bound in its yield curve control corridor, and the BOJ has apparently looked-through the short-lived drops.</li><li><i>For reference, the next MPM will take place on October 30th.</i></li></ul>",
