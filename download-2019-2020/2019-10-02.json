XAU, Yen and Treasuries saw inflows whilst all equity sectors traded in the red with desks noting outright liquidation rather than sector rotation. The bearish EIA report exacerbated the losses in energy markets, too. Thursday’s ISM non-manufacturing and Friday’s payrolls report will be critical for the market in whether support can be found going into the weekend and ahead of the high-level US-China trade talks beginning on October 10th.</p><p><strong>* US ADP NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT: </strong>ADP’s private survey of payroll growth showed 135k additions in September, short of the consensus 140k, while the prior<strong> </strong>was revised lower from 190k to 157k. The average monthly job growth for the past three months is at 145k, last year the average stood at 214k for the same period, showing signs the job market is showing, ADP said . Pantheon Macroeconomics stated it is not as soft as it seems, however, as it incorporates official payroll data from the prior month, which only saw a rise of 96K, adding constraint to the September ADP headline print. PM note today’s data does not change their forecast for Non-Farm Payrolls on Friday, adding, “The downshift in labor demand in all the surveys we follow suggest job gains will be down to just 50-to-75K by the turn of next year.” It also states that with the lower revisions has no implication for revisions to the official data on Friday.</p><p><strong>* WTO: </strong>As had been expected, the World Trading Organisation ruled that the US can slap tariffs of up to USD 7.5bln on EU imports, due to the illegal subsidies given to Airbus (AIR FP). Reports have suggested that the US has prepared a list of USD 21bln worth of European goods which could be subject to US tariffs; the EU has its own list of USD 20bln US exports to target. The EU immediately responded, saying US imposition of measures on EU imports over Airbus subsidies would be short sighted and counter-productive, adding that it was seeking fair settlement in the cases of aircraft subsidies, but stated that it would respond with measures in the Boeing case if the US pursued tariffs against Airbus. There were later reports that the US had requested an emergency meeting for mid-October of the WTO dispute body, a signal that it is moving fast to implement tariffs. The WTO is also set to rule on a separate EU case against US subsidies to Boeing (BA), which have also previously been judged as illegal; that decision is due in the first half of 2020, and will determine the value of exports the EU can slap tariffs on.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed’s Williams (voter) said the outlook for the economy was mixed, though the economy seemed in a favourable place. Williams took note that trade uncertainty and geopolitical risks were creating crosscurrents as the Fed tries to keep the economy in ‘roughly the same place’. Williams again warned about reading too much into yield curves, but suggested the flatness showed investor uncertainty. He felt the labour market was strong, and that the economy was in a positive place. Williams intimated that he was keeping an eye on money markets, which had kept him up at night. Looking ahead, Williams said that during a recession, actions from the Fed playbook would include rate cuts, forward guidance and bond purchases. Fed’s Barkin (non-voter) said his posture on the rate outlook was very balanced; he expects a lot of information before the next FOMC meeting, appearing to suggest he will approach in a data-dependent mindset. Barkin also noted that businesses remain challenged to pass along pricing, and that manufacturing weakness was a result of trade uncertainties.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's De Guindos argued that low or negative interest rates inflate prices as investors search for yield and take on more credit and duration risk. He said the current interest rate environment had various implications for the banking sector, noting that banks have benefited, and will continue to benefit from the lower credit risk for borrowers, as well as from higher asset valuations associated with lower interest rates and better macroeconomic outcomes. However, De Guindos said that negative rates policy also entails costs for banks, and these could increase the longer negative rates are in place; the lower policy rates are set, the larger the amount of excess liquidity held by banks.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 15+ HIGHER AT 131-04+: </strong>The TPLEX rallied again as risk appetite continued to dwindle due to persistent global weakness in manufacturing, with added strain of the WTO clearing the way for a new US-EU trade front. The curve continued to bull steepen throughout the session with CME market expectations for an October rate cut rising to 77%, compared to 55% priced in the wake of Tuesday’s ISM manufacturing data and 40% before it. Participants now wait crucially on Thursday’s ISM non-manufacturing and Friday’s payrolls to see whether they echo the ominous tone from the manufacturing sector. At settlement the 2-year yield fell by 8bps, and the long bond being little changed.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.98 LOWER AT USD 52.64/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 1.20 LOWER AT USD 57.69/BBL. </strong>With risk assets continuing to suffer in wake of Tuesday's grim manufacturing ISM, energy futures were already trundling on the downside before accelerating into a sharp leg lower as the EIA weekly inventory data reversed bullish support after the surprise draw reported in the API data on Tuesday. The EIA reported crude stock building 3.1mln bbls (exp. 1.6mln bbls, and contrary to the API reporting a 5.6mln bbl draw). Products were more price supportive; gasoline saw a surprise draw of 0.2mln bbls, whilst distillates drew more than expected at 2.4mln bbls. Elsewhere in the report, net imports were little changed, US production ticked down to 12.4mln BPD (from 12.5mln BPD) and refinery utilisation fell by 3.4% (exp. -0.5%). As Saudi production concerns seemingly subside, the crude market is again fixated on its bearish direction in the overhang of Tuesday’s dismal manufacturing PMIs (globally) exacerbating demand concerns for energy (excluding Middle East conflict and a US-China trade truce); It is worth noting that next week will see US/China trade talks, so focus may shift back to the demand side, especially if negotiators strike a constructive tone), analysts are struggling to identify near-term bullish catalysts for crude benchmarks. Analysts aren’t decided on the downward price trend, however, for example Citi’s analysts say, “the expanded current supply/demand deficit off the Saudi production losses argues strongly against complacency regarding supply or a bearish price view,” with the question begging if whether the geopolitical risk premium needs revaluating on potential for more oil infrastructure attacks in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -1.8% at 2888, NASDAQ-100 -1.7% at 7551, Dow Jones -1.9% at 26079</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500</strong> <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -1.8%, Consumer Staples -1.9%, Energy -2.6%, Financials -2.1%, Health Care -1.5%, Industrials -2%, Information Technology -2%, Materials -1.9%, Telecommunication Services -1.4%, Utilities -1.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Retail stocks (LB, KSS, CPRI, M, BBY) printed chunky losses amid growing expectations of manufacturing weakness seeping into the thus-far generally resilient consumer, historically noted as the last domino to fall. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) bucked the trend and traded in the green after initial opioid settlement payments indicated less severe liability management going forward; Humana (HUM) was another related name in the green. Ford (F) feel after disappointing September vehicle sales. Delta Air Lines (DAL) tumbled as it announced increased unit costs for its third quarter ahead of its official report on October 10th, weighing on competitors such as United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL). Paychex (PAYX) and Lennar (LEN) both outperformed after strong earnings reports, although the latter did fluctuate during its conference call over warnings of labour shortages. Goldminers (NEM, GOLD) benefitted from the bullion gains on declining risk appetite. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Monster Energy (MNST) gapped lower on the open after downgrades at Bernstein and Guggenheim, respectively. E-Trade (ETFC) traded lower again following a double downgrade at Barclays and no doubt helped by TD Ameritrade (AMTD) joining Charles Schwab (SCHW) in cutting trading commission to 0%.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (HK/IRAN/NK): </strong>Overnight, North Korea fired a short-range missile over the East China Sea, which may have split into two, as one part of it reportedly landed inside the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and another outside.&nbsp; Japan’s PM Abe is to reportedly hold a meeting to decide how to respond as it violated UN resolutions. The White House is aware of the matter and is being monitored. Previously, when North Korea tested short range missiles, US President Trump seemed to have no problem with it. In terms of the missile specifics, it appears to be a submarine-based launch, and it was the longest-range weapon ever tested by the North Koreans, therefore seeming more alarming than previous missile tests. The missile tests come as US officials and NK officials are set to meet this week.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The new plan is reportedly to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market (for agriculture and manufactured goods) for four years, but not in the customs union. After four years, Northern Ireland lawmakers would decide whether they want to remain in that regime or align itself with the rest of the UK. Analysts say the plan essentially involves two borders: one between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (given both parts would exist in different customs environments), and the other border with the rest of the UK, since NI would have different regulatory standards. The DUP are reported to be 'happy' with reports of the new plan; although DUP’s Dodd expressed concern on the regulatory divergence between UK and NI, stating nothing can be done in regard to the regulatory divergence between the UK and NI without Unionist consent, so it is \"no change whatsoever\". It had been reported that the EU would take its cue from Ireland on whether or not they would accept the proposals; sources familiar with the matter put a chance of the EU accepting the deal at 10%. Other outlets have suggested UK PM Johnson will offer an ultimatum to the EU: negotiate Brexit on the UK's terms within the next nine days, or face a no-deal divorce. The EU commission announced it welcomed UK PM Johnson's determination to advance Brexit talks and Juncker acknowledged the postie advances, notably to the regulatory alignment for control of goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, however he said it will need further work in coming days, notably on the backstop. Juncker added that the delicate balance struck by the good Friday agreement must be preserved and another concern needing to be addressed is the substantive customs rules. Juncker reiterated the EU wants a deal and will remain united and ready to work to make this happen. Later on, the phone call between Johnson and Irish PM Varadkar was reportedly useful and constructive, although work still remains, adding the proposals did not fully meet the objectives of the backstop and that he would study them further and consult the EU.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>USD </strong>attempted a post ISM manufacturing recovery as it regained some ground overnight heading towards the 99.50 level, however gains were short-lived as the greenback turned course in the morning and continued to sell off throughout the rest of the session, breaking the 99 handle to the downside with a weaker ADP report doing little to slow the fall. DXY consolidates around the 99 level heading into Asia trade.</p><p><strong>GBPUSD </strong>started the session on the backfoot, not helped by<strong> </strong>a miss in UK construction PMI’s. However, initial losses were pared and the cross traded relatively flat, hovering around the 1.23 handle as markets (and the EU) awaited Johnson’s proposal. Once the EU read the proposal, they seemed rather upbeat however did caveat their positivity by noting concerns still-remain about the deal, notably on customs and the backstop; cable remained glued to the 1.23 mark.</p><p><strong>CHF: </strong>EURCHF rose by around a point on Wednesday,<strong> </strong>giving up some of its haven gains from the prior day, following the triple-whammy of factors including, comments from SNB’s Maechler, who reiterated the statement saying monetary policy must continue to be expansive given global uncertainty; inflation figures coming in rather soft, slowing to 0.1% - from a prior 0.3% - missing expectations for the pace and raising the ghost of deflation again; KOF Economic forecasts seeing GDP and CPI cut for both 2019 and 2020, forecasting a rate cut towards the end of this year due to upward pressure on the Swiss. Some desks noted that the Swissy’s move had the hallmark of SNB intervention.</p><p><strong>Havens: </strong>Havens continued their bid today (apart from CHF on aforementioned reasons) amid a flight to quality following on from yesterday’s poor PMI data, and a weaker ADP employment report amid a poor global growth outlook, painting a rather grim picture ahead of Friday’s jobs report. JPY outperformed against the buck finding support just above 107 seeing lows of 107.06, rate differentials also likely benefited the JPY as US yields fall. <strong>XAU</strong> soaring today as the precious metal continued its rally finding highs above the 1500 mark at 1504, before consolidating just beneath the key psychological level heading into Asia trade.</p><p><strong>EMFX</strong>: BRL opened weaker after the Senate approved the government’s pension reform bill with amendments. However, the Real ended on the front foot against the buck amid broad dollar weakness with the amendments on the bill to be presented later this evening.&nbsp; <strong>ZAR </strong>also stronger against the Dollar, likely benefiting from the approval to split Eskom to help the electricity company. <strong>MXN</strong> little changed amid US House Speaker Pelosi highlighting progress on the USMCA deal.</p><p><strong>* USMCA: </strong>US House Speaker Pelosi said that progress is being made in securing congressional approval on the USMCA trade deal, but stressed that there is still work to be done, particularly in areas of enforceability. US President Trump later hit out at the Democrat House Speaker, accusing her of being disingenuous about her reasoning for not moving forward with the plan.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>With risk assets continuing to suffer in wake of Tuesday's grim manufacturing ISM, energy futures were already trundling on the downside before accelerating into a sharp leg lower as the EIA weekly inventory data reversed bullish support after the surprise draw reported in the API data on Tuesday. The EIA reported crude stock building 3.1mln bbls (exp. 1.6mln bbls, and contrary to the API reporting a 5.6mln bbl draw). Products were more price supportive; gasoline saw a surprise draw of 0.2mln bbls, whilst distillates drew more than expected at 2.4mln bbls. Elsewhere in the report, net imports were little changed, US production ticked down to 12.4mln BPD (from 12.5mln BPD) and refinery utilisation fell by 3.4% (exp. -0.5%). As Saudi production concerns seemingly subside, the crude market is again fixated on its bearish direction in the overhang of Tuesday’s dismal manufacturing PMIs (globally) exacerbating demand concerns for energy (excluding Middle East conflict and a US-China trade truce); It is worth noting that next week will see US/China trade talks, so focus may shift back to the demand side, especially if negotiators strike a constructive tone), analysts are struggling to identify near-term bullish catalysts for crude benchmarks. Analysts aren’t decided on the downward price trend, however, for example Citi’s analysts say, “the expanded current supply/demand deficit off the Saudi production losses argues strongly against complacency regarding supply or a bearish price view,” with the question begging if whether the geopolitical risk premium needs revaluating on potential for more oil infrastructure attacks in the Middle East.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The traditional safe-havens have diverged markedly, with the Yen making more ground at the expense of the Dollar in wake of a weaker than ADP survey that does not augur well for Friday’s NFP, softer US Treasury yields and ongoing global trade/geopolitical tensions following the WTO ruling in favour of Usd7.5 bn retaliatory US tariffs to counter EU subsidies for Airbus, more Iranian sabre rattling, another NK missile test and unrest in HK. Conversely, a bearish combination of weak Swiss inflation, downbeat KOF GDP and CPI forecasts and dovish SNB comments have undermined the Franc, with some market observers speculating that official intervention supplemented Maechler’s remarks about being ready to act. Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from recent 108.40+ peaks towards 107.25, while Usd/Chf rebounded to around 1.0025 before the Buck buckled again. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> has retested support around 99.000 and a 99.091 Fib having attempted a post-ISM manufacturing recovery rally and fading just ahead of 99.500.</p><p><strong>CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another marked G10 underperformer as the Loonie continued to reverse from peaks just shy of 1.3200 and almost turned full circle as oil prices extended their retracement in wake of EIA crude inventory stocks showing a big build in contrast to the API and more than expected. Usd/Cad got very close to 1.3300 and resistance just above the big figure at 1.3310, with Eur/<strong>NOK </strong>up through 10.0000 and Eur/<strong>SEK </strong>following suit on broadly risk-off trade, albeit the Swedish Krona not as badly shaken as its Norwegian counterpart.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>The single currency and Sterling both benefited from the aforementioned Greenback reversal having waned in early EU trade, as Eur/Usd breached 1.0950 and Cable regained 1.2300 status awaiting more EU reaction to the last and potentially final proposal for alternative Irish border/custom arrangements from UK PM Johnson.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars are ending a see-saw midweek EU session on a mixed footing as the Kiwi staged a firmer recovery from circa 0.6220 lows compared to the Aussie that faces psychological resistance at 0.6700 and ongoing US-China trade uncertainty in the run up to next week’s high level meetings in Washington.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad gains vs the flagging Usd, as the Zar gathered momentum on ANC approval of plans to split Eskom as part of the latest aid plan and chart impulses when 15.4000 was tested, but not breached. Meanwhile, the Real overcame initial reservations after the Senate’s vote in favour of Brazil’s pension reform bill with amendments that will be presented later today. Similarly, the Try derived comfort on technical vibes when a rise over 5.7500 did not prompt follow-through buying or trigger stops and the Lira subsequently probed sub-5.7000 levels.</p>",

Moreover, Nomura note that CTAs are still unwinding their long positions in US equity futures, with ES, NQ and YM futures all now undercutting the “trigger lines” (representing our estimates of where CTAs' long positions break even on average) at 2,970, 7,750 and 26,680 respectively.</li><li>The bank argues there are two implications of the manufacturing PMI reading.

Secondly, Nomura argue there is the potential for a downward adjustment in the S&amp;P 500; the bank notes that dividend yields have become dissociated from US manufacturing momentum and continue to pull away, meaning that share prices have not fallen far enough, or that the market's expected rate of return is parked at a low level.

Elements of the deal (particularly the creation of two borders), are understood to have puzzled senior European diplomats and officials. (Telegraph) <strong>Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said if the Telegraph reports are true, it does not look like basis for an agreement, however DUP sources have confirmed that the party is largely “content” with the proposals,</strong> <strong>which are believed to still include a lot of elements of the backstop and&nbsp; a “Stormont lock” which gives NI politicians a say in future EU rules.</strong> (Newswires/Guardian) <strong>Separate reports noted that officials and diplomats in Brussels are concerned that UK PM Johnson's plan has been specially designed to be unacceptable to the EU.</strong> (Times) <strong>UK PM Johnson says he has nine days left to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU as on October 11th, the agenda will be set for the EU summit taking place on October 17th.

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>Major European Bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 -1.3%) are firmly lower, amid a lack of fresh bearish fundamentals, as the region more takes its cue from a negative AsiaPac lead; sentiment was downbeat overnight following Wall Street underperformance after bad US ISM Manufacturing data, the latest missile test launch out of North Korea and ongoing tensions in Hong Kong. Looking ahead, at 15.00 BST the WTO is expected to announce its decision on the US' right to retaliate to against the EU over their Airbus (-0.8%) subsidies, a potential source of impetus. Prior reports have suggested the ruling will allow the US to impose tariffs on roughly USD 8bln of EU imports on a wide range of products. Sectors are also firmly in the red; Materials (-2.1%), Industrials (-1.7%) and Energy (-2.0%) (despite slightly higher crude prices) are leading the sectors lower while Consumer Staples (-0.9%), Telecoms (-0.8%) and Utilities (-1.0%) hold up comparatively better. In terms of individual movers; Flutter Entertainment (+18.4%) shot higher on the news of the co.’s merger with Stars Group, pulling other betting names higher such as William Hill (+4.3%) higher in tandem. Nestle (-0.2%) shares are being supported by the Co.’s sale of its Skin Health unit. Tesco (+0.6%) managed to reverse early losses and now trades higher, after the co. released decent earnings premarket, but its CEO resigned. Pernod Ricard (+0.7%) is higher after being upgraded at Jefferies. Luxury names including LVMH (-2.0%) and Richemont (-2.1%) underperformed the market, with bad retail data out of Hong Kong (the largest decline on record) weighing.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar has clawed back some losses following yesterday’s abrupt U-turn from new 2019 highs in the DXY with the index bouncing firmly ahead of 99.000 towards 99.420, as attention switches to NFP via ADP and hopefully better news from the services side of the US economy after the more pronounced ISM manufacturing activity slowdown. However, the Greenback is also benefiting from renewed weakness in rival currencies and general risk aversion awaiting the WTO ruling on the extent that the US can counter EU subsidies for Airbus and repercussions in Brussels after UK PM Johnson delivers his latest/last Brexit proposal.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP -</strong> The clear G10 underperformers, with the Franc deflated on weak Swiss CPI grounds, further SNB guidance from Maechler expounding the virtues of NIRP allied to direct FX intervention and the KOF cutting growth and inflation estimates, while the Pound has been hit by a dire UK construction PMI and the ongoing political/Irish border wrangling. Consequently, Usd/Chf is back up near parity and Cable has recoiled from 1.2300+ towards Tuesday’s low only a few pips away from the big figure below, with the focus turning to Johnson’s appearance at the Tory Party conference from noon.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - The Aussie and Kiwi are also unwinding/reversing post-US ISM manufacturing gains, as Aud/Usd returns to ytd lows circa 0.6670 and Nzd/Usd retests bids protecting 0.6200 alongside YUAN depreciation in holiday-thinned trade.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD -</strong> Holding up a bit better than most major counterparts, but some way off best levels vs the Buck as the single currency failed to sustain momentum through 1.0950 and Loonie could not breach 1.3200 amidst confirmation of more German GDP forecast downgrades and a downturn in crude prices.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> Bucking the broad, if not overall trend, safe-haven demand/positioning has kept the Yen elevated between 107.90-55 against the Dollar, and from a chart perspective the 100 DMA in Usd/Jpy (now around 107.76) remains pivotal.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Rand in the spotlight ahead of ANC judgment on the latest SA growth plan and following the SARB’s semi-annual MPR, with some technical support coming from a pull-back from 1 month peaks in Usd/Zar around 15.4000 to almost 15.3000 at one stage.</p><p>Goldman Sachs economists say the RBA's internal economic model suggests the Central Bank will need to release a USD 200bln QE programme to achieve its unemployment and inflation targets.

Hence, inverse asset correlations remain broken or fragile at best and divergence is emanating across the Atlantic divide even though demand for German Bobls was relatively strong and UK bonds are prone to regaining a no deal Brexit premium at the whim of any breaking headline that delivers a rejection from the EU to PM Johnson’s final offer.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The crude complex is mixed, giving away the majority of overnight gains, where the complex bounced from post US ISM Manufacturing data lows helped by a bullish headline API print, as risk sentiment took a turn for the worse at the European open. <strong>WTI and Brent</strong> currently sit just below the USD 54.00/bbl and USD 59.00/bbl levels respectively. To the downside technicians will be eyeing the USD 53.00/bbl handle in WTI; yesterday’s low and the late August/early September base. After yesterday’s choppy session, which saw Gold price swings of north of USD 40/oz, the precious metal is lacklustre and seemingly awaiting further macro drivers in the form of today’s ADP employment report, ISM Non-manufacturing tomorrow and NFP on Friday. In fitting with fragile risk sentiment, Copper remains under pressure as global growth concerns linger, albeit the red metal is off yesterday’s post ISM Manufacturing data lows.</p><p><strong>API Crude Inventories -5.9mln (exp. +1.6mln, Prev. +1.4mln) (Newswires)</strong> API Cushing Inventories<strong> </strong>+0.37mln (Prev. +2.3mln) API Distillate Inventories<strong> </strong>-1.7mln (exp. -1.8, Prev. -2.2mln) API Gasoline Inventories<strong> </strong>+2.1mln (exp. +0.4mln, Prev. +1.9mln)</p><p>Russian oil production (Sep): 11.25MBPD (Prev. 11.29MBPD)., according to the Energy Ministry.

In fitting with fragile risk sentiment, Copper remains under pressure as global growth concerns linger, albeit the red metal is off yesterday’s post ISM Manufacturing data lows.</p>",

Under the terms of the proposal, Northern Ireland would continue to follow all EU single market rules for agricultural and industrial goods until 2025, four years after the end of the ‘transition’ period in 2021. Elements of the deal (particularly the creation of two borders), are understood to have puzzled senior European diplomats and officials. (Telegraph) Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said if the Telegraph reports are true, it does not look like basis for an agreement, however DUP sources have confirmed that the party is largely “content” with the proposals, which are believed to still include a lot of elements of the backstop and&nbsp; a “Stormont lock” which gives NI politicians a say in future EU rules. (Newswires/Guardian) Separate reports noted that officials and diplomats in Brussels are concerned that UK PM Johnson's plan has been specially designed to be unacceptable to the EU. (Times) UK PM Johnson says he has nine days left to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU as on October 11th, the agenda will be set for the EU summit taking place on October 17th. (Sun)</p>",

Bunds kicked off Eurex at 173.86 and only managed a fleeting uptick to 173.89 before retreating further from yesterday’s 174.20 close to a 173.73 low, and the corresponding yield is poised to retest the psychological -50 bp mark ahead of Eur3 bn Bobl supply and more GC rhetoric courtesy of de Guindos.</p>",

Elements of the deal (particularly the creation of two borders), are understood to have puzzled senior European diplomats and officials. (Telegraph) <strong>Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said if the Telegraph reports are true, it does not look like basis for an agreement, however DUP sources have confirmed that the party is largely “content” with the proposals,</strong> <strong>which are believed to still include a lot of elements of the backstop and&nbsp; a “Stormont lock” which gives NI politicians a say in future EU rules.</strong> (Newswires/Guardian) <strong>Separate reports noted that officials and diplomats in Brussels are concerned that UK PM Johnson's plan has been specially designed to be unacceptable to the EU.</strong> (Times) <strong>UK PM Johnson says he has nine days left to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU as on October 11th, the agenda will be set for the EU summit taking place on October 17th.

Further, <strong>Japanese PM Abe will hold a meeting of the National Security Council to decide how to respond to the projectile firings</strong>. In terms of details, South Korean Defence Ministry said the missiles launched by North Korea have a range of circa 1300km and was likely launched at a higher apogee to decrease range and could have been fired from a submarine. Japan has not yet determined whether North Korea's missiles were Submarine-launched ballistic missile and notes it may have been one missile which split into two. <strong>The White House said it is aware of the launch and is monitoring the situation.</strong> (Newswires/SCMP)</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister said Iranian claims that Saudi Arabia has sent messages to the Iranian regime are inaccurate</strong>,<strong> </strong>WSJ's Summer Said reported.

Thus, <strong>EUR/USD </strong>and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> have clung on to most of its Dollar-induced gains as the former hovered just below the 1.0950 level, whilst the latter meandered around 1.2300 ahead of PM Johnson’s formal unveiling of his final Brexit plan. Elsewhere, the <strong>JPY</strong> remained underpinned by the risk sentiment, with overnight focus on the geopolitical landscape as North Korea test-fired projectiles in which one reportedly landed inside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> resided around its 100 DMA (107.76) with just under 1bln in options expiring between strikes 107.50-70 ahead of the pair’s 50 DMA at 107.05. Meanwhile, antipodeans are modestly firmer amid the Dollar’s demise, <strong>NZD/USD</strong> tested 0.6250 to the upside whilst its <strong>Aussie</strong> counterpart reclaimed the 0.6700 handle following yesterday’s fall to YTD lows (0.6670).&nbsp;</p><p>Goldman Sachs economists say the RBA's internal economic model suggests the Central Bank will need to release a USD 200bln QE programme to achieve its unemployment and inflation targets.

WTI has reclaimed 54/bbl to the upside (ahead of its 50 WMA at 56.34/bbl), whilst its Brent counterpart regained USD 59/bbl+ status. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were uneventful after finding a base at 1460/oz yesterday, with the next level to the upside at 1496/oz (50 DMA).

However, prior to the US session Fixed Income assets were on the backfoot, with JGBs leading the losses after a disappointing 10-year auction; desks were attributing the move as somewhat of a “taper tantrum” amid the BoJ’s latest efforts in reducing its bond purchases to steepen the curve. Fed’s repo operation was again undersubscribed in more evidence to easing liquidity conditions in money markets. By Treasury settlement the curve had bear steepened, no part assisted by growing market expectations of an October rate cut by the Fed, with the 2-year yield down by 6bps, 10-year yield down by 2bps, and the 30-year yield little changed.</p><p>Australia's Labor party is intensifying its demands for the Australian PM Morrison to release the transcript of a conversation with US President Trump, accusing the PM of cosying up to the US President at the expense of Australia's national interest.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets took cue from the negative lead from Wall Street in which the major indices declined on the first day of Q4 after US ISM Manufacturing PMI contracted to its worst level since June 2009. Losses in ASX 200 (-1.4%) accelerated after NAB shares tumble 3% amid an additional AUD 1.2bln charge relating to increased provisions for customer-related remediation, whereas upside in the Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) was limited by unfavourable currency flow, whilst Toyota shares slumped due to poor North American vehicle sales figures and Sony shares remained near the bottom of the index after cutting streaming prices ahead of Google’s Stadia launch. Elsewhere, the Hang Seng (-0.9%) climbed off lows after returning from a long weekend, albeit oil giants remain pressured after Norway’s Sovereign Wealth fund received the green light to sell USD 6bln worth of oil and gas stocks, meanwhile upside in the index is capped by the ongoing situation in Hong Kong as protestors vowed to step up action after a police officer shot a teenager yesterday. As a reminder, Mainland China and Indian markets are closed today due to public holidays.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY continues its slide from YTD highs down towards the 99.00 mark amid persisting weakness from the dismal US ISM Manufacturing metric. Thus, EUR/USD and GBP/USD have held on to a bulk of its Dollar-induced gains with the former eyeing 1.0950 to the upside, whilst the latter meanders around 1.2300 ahead of PM Johnson’s formal unveiling of the final Brexit deal, which sees a border in the Irish Sea and Northern Ireland following all EU single market rules for agricultural and industrial goods until 2025. Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said if the Telegraph reports are true, it does not look like basis for an agreement, although DUP sources have confirmed that the party is largely “content” with the proposals. Elsewhere, the JPY remains underpinned by the risk sentiment, with overnight focus on the geopolitical landscape as North Korea test-fired projectiles in which one reportedly landed inside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone. USD/JPY remains below its 100 DMA (107.76) with just under 1bln in options expiring between strikes 107.50-70 ahead of the pair’s 50 DMA at 107.05. Meanwhile, antipodeans are modestly firmer amid the Dollar’s demise, NZD/USD tested 0.6250 to the upside whilst its Aussie counterpart reclaimed the 0.6700 handle following yesterday’s fall to YTD lows (0.6670).&nbsp;</p>",
