Some selling pressure is likely due to month-end rebalancing, which is also likely to have supported the bid in USTs. Internally, value names were the outperformers, with energy, materials and industrials all up by more than 2%; MMM earnings were supportive while the energy sector continues to find solace in alluded to fiscal support. The crude complex had a choppy session as participants jump between calendar spreads while they digest the woes in the physical market, although unlike last week, other risk assets were less reactive/concerned, perhaps an indication that the market believes the issues in energy are localised, for now at least. Caterpillar (CAT) beat on EPS, missed on revenue and withdrew its guidance, adding roughly 75% of its facilities are still operating and it has USD 7.1bln of cash and USD 10.5bln in credit facilities. 3M (MMM) beat on top and bottom line and reduced its FY20 CapEx plan to prioritise its investment and dividends, although it has suspended its share repurchase programme. Merck (MRK) saw top and bottom-line beats although lowered its FY20 forecasts beneath expectations and Pfizer (PFE) also saw top and bottom-line beats, while reaffirming its FY20 adj. EPS forecast. SPX -0.5% at 2863, NDX -1.8% at 8678, DJIA -0.1% at 24,101.</p><p>It was one-way traffic for the T-Note in the US session as yields trundled lower amid paring risk appetite and ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC. A positive risk tone in the European session kept yields slightly elevated, although as US participants stepped in, the bid made headway. The UST strength was likely a function of equity bourses coming off their highs as well as participants taking advantage of Treasury supply out the way and higher yields ahead of the FOMC, where there is a chance the Fed could hint at some form of YCC and tweak its current programmes; however, the base case is for the Fed to announce such measures at the June meeting instead. Additionally, another chunky fall in LIBOR saw the front-end lead the rally, particularly white pack Eurodollars, as market participants continue to lower their forecasts for funding costs to that of a level closer to the FFR. By settlement, the yield curve had flattened: 2s -2bps at 0.21%, while both 10s and 30s fell by 4.5bps to 0.61% and 1.20%, respectively. US T-note futures (M0) settled 11+ ticks higher at 139-00+.</p>",

The selling wasn’t particularly headline-driven and was led by the NDX index, as the recent mega-cap momentum winners (AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, FB, NFLX) traded in the red, ahead of their earnings releases. Lows were reached early on and indices traded sideways for the rest of the session, with the SPX around 2,870/90 (VIX saw resistance at the 35 handle) and NDQ 8,720/60, before a late session leg lower. Some selling pressure is likely due to month-end rebalancing, which is also likely to have supported the bid in USTs. Internally, value names were the outperformers, with energy, materials and industrials all up by more than 2%; MMM earnings were supportive while the energy sector continues to find solace in alluded to fiscal support. The crude complex had a choppy session as participants jump between calendar spreads while they digest the woes in the physical market, although unlike last week, other risk assets were less reactive/concerned, perhaps an indication that the market believes the issues in energy are localised, for now at least.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Tuesday (via state official health departments) against Monday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US</strong>: cases +2.4% at 981,246 (Prev. 957,875); death toll +2.4% at 55,258 (Prev. 53,922).</li><li><strong>NEW YORK</strong>: death toll rises +1.9% to 17,638 (prev. +2.0% at 17,303).</li><li><strong>ITALY: </strong>cases rise 1.1% to 201,505 (prev. +0.9% at 199,414), death toll rises +1.4% to 27,539 (prev. +1.3% at 26,977).</li><li><strong>UK: </strong>cases rise to 161,145 (prev. 157,149), death toll rises to 21,678 (prev. 21,092); deaths rise by 586 (+2.78%) vs. yesterday’s increase of 300 (+1.74%).</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT: </strong>Pfizer (PFE) said it could have a coronavirus vaccine ready for use on an emergency basis in the fall if it proves to work safely in testing, WSJ reported. Earlier on, Pfizer’s CEO told CNBC that the company is already preparing COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing which will happen in the US and Europe. The company plans to be able to supply millions of doses this year and hundreds of millions of doses next year.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US STIMULUS: </strong>Senate Majority Leader McConnell reportedly told Republican senators that he would not support infrastructure spending in the fourth COVID-19 bill – which the White House and Democrats have been in favour of. “We need to keep the White House in the box,” McConnell told senators, according to two sources. After the US House (and Trump) passed the coronavirus relief bill on Friday, as expected, talks are on the way for Stimulus v4.0. House Speaker Pelosi said they will be ready soon with the next bill, following comments from Senate Minority Leader Schumer that momentum is growing for Congressional relief package for state and local governments. On the next round of stimulus, there are three key features desks will be looking for in the next round of stimulus: relief for state and local governments (a Democrat demand they wanted in the v3.5 stimulus bill); infrastructure spending (Trump has touted a USD 2trln figure previously, while Democrats have expressed some interest in recent weeks); and additionally, support for US energy companies, which are facing stress as oil prices slide. House Speaker Pelosi said today that lawmakers are mulling USD 400-500bln in support for states and additional money for county and municipal governments, adding that aid to state and local governments would target COVID-19 outlays and revenue lost due to the pandemic. Regarding the timeframe of approving new stimulus, House Majority Leader Hoyer said the House would not come back next week as planned due to lack of virus safety. Note: McConnell Monday announced the Senate would return on May 4th although there will be a modified routine. Hoyer later added the House would also be returning with votes possible, however, he has now reversed course which could potentially impact the stimulus procedures. Elsewhere, NEC Director Kudlow said US President Trump has asked for a review of a possible middle class tax relief. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Congress will debate additional aid to States, and there will not be a Federal bailout of States. Mnuchin added that it is highly unlikely that the US government would purchase stocks, although reiterated that the US is looking at providing liquidity to the oil industry and is committed to maintaining energy independence.</p><p><strong>CHINA: </strong>President Trump suggested the US is not happy with China and are doing a serious investigation of China’s actions in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED MLF: </strong>The NY Fed expanded the scope and duration of the municipal liquidity facility (MLF) and increased the duration of eligible securities to 3 years from 2 years, while it widened the scope to cover counties with populations of at least 500k (prev. 2mln) and cities of 250k residents (prev. 1mln), and will consider expanding facility to include limited number of government entities that issue revenue bonds. The MLF expansion is more of an incremental change to US monetary policy following the alphabet soup that was announced back in March, although is indicative of its willpower to adjust policy as needed.</p><p><strong>FOMC PREVIEW: </strong>No major announcements are expected; rates are seen unchanged at the ELB of 0-0.25%. There will be focus on the updated statement that reflects incoming information, as well as the Committee’s judgement on how its new facilities are evolving. The FOMC will likely reiterate pledges to do more if necessary. Traders will also be looking for clues about forward guidance changes, and other new policies in the pipeline, like yield curve control. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24377/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>ECB PREVIEW: </strong>The ECB is expected to stand pat on rates this week with focus instead likely to fall on the Bank’s balance sheet and how it views monetary and fiscal actions taken thus far. On the balance sheet, consensus leans in favour of the GC needing to expand the current scope of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). Views are mixed on whether such an adjustment will be made this week or Lagarde will invoke strong rhetoric on the Bank’s preparedness to do more and defer the decision until June when lockdown measures have been eased across the Eurozone. As has been a common theme throughout Lagarde’s tenure, the President will likely use the press conference as a forum to call for further support from fiscal authorities. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24387/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 0.44 LOWER AT USD 12.34; WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 0.48 LOWER AT USD 17.60; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 0.47 HIGHER AT USD 20.46; BRENT (N0) SETTLED 0.33 LOWER AT USD 22.74.</strong></p><p>A choppy session for the crude complex amid ongoing storage concerns and participants moving along the term structure. After the USO announced it would be liquidating all June WTI exposure on Monday, it today announced a USD 1.2bln income loss for the month of March (after front month futures printed negative for the first time ever last week), although the fund had rolled into June by that point. Participants are now assessing when the market will rebalance; Morgan Stanley says that if physical storage capacity limits are reached it expects the crude term structure to be heavily weighed on in not just the front-month, but also as far as month three and four, arguing for a flatter curve further out the front. The bank believes that there is potential for upside in the 2021 strip, where the current supply glut could evolve into too tighter conditions for next year, but caveats that it is unlikely that the back-end of the forward curve rallies while there is pressure in the front. Ahead of OPEC+ supply cuts due to come into effect at the end of this week, tanker tracker Petro Logistics reported that OPEC oil supply in April rose by over 2mln BPD, driven by record Saudi and UAE supply and higher Kuwaiti output; the highest since December 2018. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventory data, with the private report due Tuesday at 1630 ET, current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +10.6mln, gasoline +2.5mln, distillates +3.6mln.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 139-00+</strong></p><p>It was one-way traffic for the T-Note in the US session as yields trundled lower amid paring risk appetite and ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC. A positive risk tone in the European session kept yields slightly elevated, although as US participants stepped in, the bid made headway. The UST strength was likely a function of equity bourses coming off their highs as well as participants taking advantage of Treasury supply out the way and higher yields ahead of the FOMC, where there is a chance the Fed could hint at some form of YCC and tweak its current programmes; however, the base case is for the Fed to announce such measures at the June meeting instead. Additionally, another chunky fall in LIBOR saw the front-end lead the rally, particularly white pack Eurodollars, as market participants continue to lower their forecasts for funding costs to that of a level closer to the FFR. By settlement, the yield curve had flattened: 2s -2bps at 0.21%, while both 10s and 30s fell by 4.5bps to 0.61% and 1.20%, respectively.</p><p><strong>SUPPLY:</strong> The US sold USD 35bln of 7-year notes, tailing the 0.524% WI by 0.1bps (smaller tails than Monday’s 2-year and 5-year auctions). The internals were mediocre with, covering 2.56x (prev. 2.76x, six-auction avg. 2.50x), and in takedown: Dealers 21.3% (prev. 28.6%, six-auction avg. 22.5%), Directs 12.3% (prev. 9.1%, six-auction avg. 14.6%), Indirects 66.4% (prev. 62.4%, six-auction avg. 63.0%). The Treasury auction saw little reaction across yields. In the corporate sector, just a handful of issuers in the dollar market today, although as many European corporates emerge from their earnings blackout, the IG Euro market has come to life, where IFR reported that nine tranches were sold for EUR 6.25bln, making it the busiest day for the market in three weeks.</p><p><strong>MONTH-END:</strong> UBS notes large Treasury extension (0.14yrs) for the end-April rebalancing. UBS says this is higher than its 3-year end-April average (0.07yrs) and historical 3-month, 6-month, 12-month averages. “It is worth noting that this unusual large extension is a result of temporary change in the rebalancing rule last month and hence incomparable to historical extension.” The bank also estimates that month-end pension rebalancing could see USD 75-115bln equities sold, and reinvested into bonds, UBS says. Model predicts USD 90-140bln of US equity selling, versus USD 15-25bln of international equity buying.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.5% at 2863, NDX -1.8% at 8678, DJIA -0.1% at 24,101.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy +2.2%, Materials +1.95%, Industrials +1.85%, Financials +0.9%, Consumer Staples +0.44%, Utilities +0.35%, Real Estate +0.02%, Consumer Discretionary -0.3%, Communications -1.4%, IT -1.4%, Health Care -2.1%.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Caterpillar (CAT) beat on EPS, missed on revenue and withdrew its guidance, adding roughly 75% of its facilities are still operating and it has USD 7.1bln of cash and USD 10.5bln in credit facilities. 3M (MMM) beat on top and bottom line and reduced its FY20 CapEx plan to prioritise its investment and dividends, although it has suspended its share repurchase programme. Merck (MRK) saw top and bottom-line beats although lowered its FY20 forecasts beneath expectations. MRK’s Keytruda sales were firmer than expected, as was its Gardasil, although Januvia+Janumet were slightly short. Pfizer (PFE) also saw top and bottom-line beats, while reaffirming its FY20 adj. EPS forecast, adding it has not seen a significant disruption in its supply chain. Its drug sales for Eliquis and Ibrance were firmer than expected, and its Prevenar revenue grew 11% Y/Y despite an expected fall of 1.1%. NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) beat on EPS although revenue fell slightly short of expectations. South West Airlines (LUV) missed on EPS and revenue, while it also filed to sell 55mln shares of stock and USD 1bln of convertible senior notes. UPS (UPS) beat estimates and withdrew its guidance. Pepsi (PEP) beat on EPS and revenue, NA organic revenue +6%, withdrew guidance, closed the Rockstar acquisition and still expects to repurchase USD 2bln worth of stock.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) has cancelled its plans to bring employees back to work at its Fremont, California plant. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) launched a consumer-initiated COVID-19 antibody test which can be purchased online without going to the doctors. Boeing Company (BA) says to restart 787 operations in South Carolina with most teammates returning May 3rd or 4th, and resumption includes all operation that were temporarily suspended on April 8th due to coronavirus. Boeing expects to see fuel costs in Q2 at 1.00-1.10 per gallon. Raytheon Technologies (RTX) increased its quarterly dividend to USD 0.475/shr from USD 0.3528/shr. Electronic Arts (EA) announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOGL) to launch EA games on Stadia</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (APR.):</strong> US Consumer Confidence tumbled to 86.9 from 120, slightly deeper than expected fall to 87.9. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlight the decline stems from the present situation component which fell 90.3 points. The expectations index however rose 7.0 pts. The consultancy suggests this shows consumers believe the labour market and business conditions are so bad at the minute, it would have to get better. PM however note the headline print is likely to fall further led by the present situation index as it tends to move with the unemployment rate where back in 2013 unemployment was just under 7%, and given the sub index is currently at those 2013 levels and unemployment is much higher than 7%. The 12-mth inflation expectations picked up to 5.3% from 4.5%, the highest since October 2014. Pantheon however believe “the risk of a near-term increase in inflation is remote, and we see even less risk that people will be in a position to translate their inflation fears - if they persist - into faster wage growth, but these numbers need to be watched over the next few months.”</p><p><strong>US ADV GOODS TRADE (MAR.):</strong> The US advanced goods trade balance printed a deficit of USD -64.22B in March, widening from the previous USD -59.89B, driven by exports falling at the fastest monthly rate since the financial crisis (exports -6.7% M/M, imports -2.4% M/M; goods exports fell 7.6ppts to -8.9% Y/Y, and imports fell to -9.6% Y/Y). Analysts at Oxford Economics warn that although trade activity collapsed in March, there will be more deterioration ahead. “With global and domestic demand contracting amid the sharpest downturn post WWII, trade will be among the sectors hit hardest,” and adds that “momentum is likely to drop further as trade is set to fall much faster in Q2 2020 than at any point during the financial crisis.”</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>RISK SENSITIVE CURRENCIES OUTPERFORM SUPPORTED BY A FALLING DOLLAR</strong></p><p><strong>MONTH END:</strong> With month-end approaching Nomura points towards USD selling, with stronger signals this week given the rise in US equities. The desk’s signal summary of weighted month-end model signals shows Strong Sell USD vs EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, AUD, NZD, SEK, NOK, CHF. Weak Buy EUR vs CAD, AUD. Weak sell AUD/JPY. Medium Buy NOK/SEK.</p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The DXY is on course for a fourth day of losses as optimism builds around re-opening economies. JPMorgan’s FX strategists said that what happens with equities will dictate the price action for the USD going forward, and we could well get a few weeks of calm and a drift higher in risk as certain economies reopen; however, the next point of focus will be on reinfections, which are likely to tick up after economies reopen.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX:</strong> Despite headlines about how prompt crude prices are collapsing earlier in the session, commodity FX fared better, and has broadly rallied against the USD on Tuesday (RUB flat). Perhaps that rally is a function of the rest of crude’s term structure (July 2020 through January 2021 WTI has added around a buck apiece today in early trade, though have settled around neutral), and perhaps due to reopening optimism.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Price action was driven by the buck today. But action was thin ahead of Wednesday’s Fed and Thursday’s ECB. EURUSD resided above the 1.08 figure throughout the session. Citi’s analysts believes EUR downside is a bit crowded and overdone, though still has a downside bias in the longer-term.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen continues to strengthen, supported by dollar weakness with the story little changed from yesterday. JPMorgan maintains a short-bias with more excitement under a 107.00 close, it wrote. We have since broke the 107 level to the downside, and the desk also highlights 106.10/20 as next level of support and if price action was to turn, 108.10/20 as resistance.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> While the Kiwi economy’s reopening far quicker than other G10 counterparts, the NZD initially underperformed on Tuesday, with traders circulating a Westpac note, where the bank sees the RBNZ taking the OCR into negative territory, which Westpac thinks will be telegraphed by the central bank by August. However, the Kiwi rebounded against the buck as risk improved morning.</p><p><strong>GBP, AUD:</strong> GBP saw a high north of 1.25 although as equities sold off in the evening much of the gains reversed and Cable now resides around 1.2435. Lloyds highlights resistance around 1.2505 ahead of the 1.2650-1.2710 region, and believes if those levels were to breach, an extension to 1.30 could be seen. The Aussie was firmer once again as it reclaims the 0.65 handle (just) as risk sentiment in FX paints a positive picture. However, as equities sold off AUD managed to hold onto the bulk of its gains, unlike sterling.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie was firmer today in line with other cyclical currencies while it once again ignored tumbling WTI prices as it looks towards an economic reopen after Ontario announced its plan yesterday, while Bombardier announced it is to resume operation in Canada gradually from May 11th.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Last month EMFX reserves across 14 major economies fell by USD 170bln in March, as EM countries aim to tackle the shortage of USD liquidity, analysts were pointing out. The majority of EMFX was firmer against the buck amid a positive risk sentiment in FX. The BRL performed particularly well as it rebounded from record lows; UBS cut its 2020 GDP growth forecast for Brazil to -5.5% from -2.0%, with their most pessimistic scenario being a 10.1% fall. MXN also fared better, in line with risk, while trade data saw a larger surplus than expected in March.</p>",

A positive risk tone in the European session kept yields slightly elevated, although as US participants stepped in, the bid made headway. The UST strength was likely a function of equity bourses coming off their highs as well as participants taking advantage of Treasury supply out the way and higher yields ahead of the FOMC, where there is a chance the Fed could hint at some form of YCC and tweak its current programmes; however, the base case is for the Fed to announce such measures at the June meeting instead. Additionally, another chunky fall in LIBOR saw the front-end lead the rally, particularly white pack Eurodollars, as market participants continue to lower their forecasts for funding costs to that of a level closer to the FFR. By settlement, the yield curve had flattened: 2s -2bps at 0.21%, while both 10s and 30s fell by 4.5bps to 0.61% and 1.20%, respectively.</li><li><strong>SUPPLY:</strong>&nbsp;The US sold USD 35bln of 7-year notes, tailing the 0.524% WI by 0.1bps (smaller tails than Monday’s 2-year and 5-year auctions). The internals were mediocre with, covering 2.56x (prev. 2.76x, six-auction avg. 2.50x), and in takedown: Dealers 21.3% (prev. 28.6%, six-auction avg. 22.5%), Directs 12.3% (prev. 9.1%, six-auction avg. 14.6%), Indirects 66.4% (prev. 62.4%, six-auction avg. 63.0%). The Treasury auction saw little reaction across yields. In the corporate sector, just a handful of issuers in the dollar market today, although as many European corporates emerge from their earnings blackout, the IG Euro market has come to life, where IFR reported that nine tranches were sold for EUR 6.25bln, making it the busiest day for the market in three weeks.</li><li><strong>MONTH-END: </strong>UBS notes large Treasury extension (0.14yrs) for the end-April rebalancing. UBS says this is higher than its 3-year end-April average (0.07yrs) and historical 3-month, 6-month, 12-month averages. \"It is worth noting that this unusual large extension is a result of temporary change in the re-balancing rule last month and hence incomparable to historical extension.\" The bank also estimates that month-end pension rebalancing could see USD 75-115bln equities sold, and reinvested into bonds, UBS says. Model predicts USD 90-140bln of US equity selling, versus USD 15-25bln of international equity buying.</li></ul>",

Medium Buy NOK/SEK.</p><p><strong>USD: </strong>The DXY is on course for a fourth day of losses as optimism builds around re-opening economies. JPMorgan’s FX strategists said that what happens with equities will dictate the price action for the USD going forward, and we could well get a few weeks of calm and a drift higher in risk as certain economies reopen; however, the next point of focus will be on reinfections, which are likely to tick up after economies reopen.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX</strong>: Despite headlines about how prompt crude prices are collapsing earlier in the session, commodity FX fared better, and has broadly rallied against the USD on Tuesday (RUB flat). Perhaps that rally is a function of the rest of crude’s term structure (July 2020 through January 2021 WTI has added around a buck apiece today in early trade, though have settled around neutral), and perhaps due to reopening optimism.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong>: Price action was driven by the buck today. But action was thin ahead of Wednesday’s Fed and Thursday’s ECB. EURUSD resided above the 1.08 figure throughout the session. Citi’s analysts believes EUR downside is a bit crowded and overdone, though still has a downside bias in the longer-term.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong>: The Yen continues to strengthen, supported by dollar weakness with the story little changed from yesterday. JPMorgan maintains a short-bias with more excitement under a 107.00 close, it wrote. We have since broke the 107 level to the downside, and the desk also highlights 106.10/20 as next level of support and if price action was to turn, 108.10/20 as resistance.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong>: While the Kiwi economy’s reopening far quicker than other G10 counterparts, the NZD initially underperformed on Tuesday, with traders circulating a Westpac note, where the bank sees the RBNZ taking the OCR into negative territory, which Westpac thinks will be telegraphed by the central bank by August. However, the Kiwi rebounded against the buck as risk improved morning.</p><p><strong>GBP, AUD: </strong>GBP saw a high north of 1.25 although as equities sold off in the evening much of the gains reversed and Cable now resides around 1.2435. Lloyds highlights resistance around 1.2505 ahead of the 1.2650-1.2710 region, and believes if those levels were to breach, an extension to 1.30 could be seen. The Aussie was firmer once again as it reclaims the 0.65 handle (just) as risk sentiment in FX paints a positive picture. However, as equities sold off AUD managed to hold onto the bulk of its gains, unlike sterling.</p><p><strong>CAD: </strong>The Loonie was firmer today in line with other cyclical currencies while it once again ignored tumbling WTI prices as it looks towards an economic reopen after Ontario announced its plan yesterday, while Bombardier announced it is to resume operation in Canada gradually from May 11th.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>Last month EMFX reserves across 14 major economies fell by USD 170bln in March, as EM countries aim to tackle the shortage of USD liquidity, analysts were pointing out. The majority of EMFX was firmer against the buck amid a positive risk sentiment in FX. The BRL performed particularly well as it rebounded from record lows, perhaps supported by trade hopes with the US as multiple Brazilian meat producers offered support to the US, with Mafrig resuming the sale of fresh beef and JBS noting if needed it can support the US from its idle capacity in Brazil and Australia amid worries of a meat shortage. Elsewhere, UBS cut its 2020 GDP growth forecast for Brazil to -5.5% from -2.0%, with their most pessimistic scenario being a 10.1% fall. MXN also fared better, in line with risk, while trade data saw a larger surplus than expected in March.</p>",

After the USO announced it would be liquidating all June WTI exposure on Monday, it today announced a USD 1.2bln income loss for the month of March (after front month futures printed negative for the first time ever last week), although the fund had rolled into June by that point. Participants are now assessing when the market will rebalance; Morgan Stanley says that if physical storage capacity limits are reached it expects the crude term structure to be heavily weighed on in not just the front-month, but also as far as month three and four, arguing for a flatter curve further out the front. The bank believes that there is potential for upside in the 2021 strip, where the current supply glut could evolve into too tighter conditions for next year, but caveats that it is unlikely that the back-end of the forward curve rallies while there is pressure in the front. Ahead of OPEC+ supply cuts due to come into effect at the end of this week, tanker tracker Petro Logistics reported that OPEC oil supply in April rose by over 2mln BPD, driven by record Saudi and UAE supply and higher Kuwaiti output; the highest since December 2018. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventory data, with the private report due Tuesday at 1630 ET, current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +10.6mln, gasoline +2.5mln, distillates +3.6mln.</p>",

Analysts at UBS calculate that this week’s cash flows will total USD 98bln, including around USD 89bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons; UBS notes that in the week of 11th May, there is around USD 86bln of cash falling due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and around USD 29bln of coupons. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>MONDAY's 2-YEAR AND 5-YEAR AUCTIONS:</strong> The US Treasury sold both 2-year and 5-year notes on Monday - both solid auctions that stopped-through the screens on decent demand. Starting with the former, which was sold at 0.229% (from the prior 0.39%), stopping-through by a chunky 1.3bps - the largest amount since July 2012; cover was 3.1x, the highest since January 2018. Direct participation was in line with recent averages, and indirects took a higher share than recent sales, leaving dealers with the lowest since last November. The 5s auction was similar, but to a lesser extent, stopping through by 0.7bps. &nbsp;Both auctions highlight that, despite projections of the US deficit rising to above USD 3trln in 2020, demand is still strong for shorter-dated Treasuries; some have suggested that this is as the market eyes potential yield curve control from the Fed, which isn’t likely to be a feature of Wednesday’s confab, though will be a key issue into the June FOMC, where some believe that the Fed might pledge to leave rates at the effective lower bound for a couple of years, supported by its action in controlling short-term yields.</p><p><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Some desks suggests that, while the 7-year trades fair in asset swap, it is expensive outright, and the current WI is trading below all stop-out rates on record. SocGen's analysts observe that both the 2s7s and 5s7s curve has flattened since the last cycle. which may indicate richness of the 7-year sectors vs the 2s and 5s. Additionally, SocGen says that low dealer holdings and strong metrics seen in the March cycle are positives, although it holds a slight negative bias going into the auction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECENT 7-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY: </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.680%, six-auction average 1.451%) &nbsp;</li><li>Tail: (prev. -2.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps) &nbsp;</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.76x, six-auction avg. 2.50x) &nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 28.6%, six-auction avg. 22.5%) &nbsp;</li><li>Direct: (prev. 9.1%, six-auction avg. 14.6%) &nbsp;</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 62.4%, six-auction avg. 63.0%)</li></ul>",

The consultancy suggests this shows consumers believe the labour market and business conditions are so bad at the moment that it would just have to get better.</li><li>Pantheon notes that the headline print is likely to fall further as the present situation index “hasn’t yet fallen enough”. The index tends to move with the unemployment rate and is currently at a level not seen since 2013, where employment was just under 7%. Given unemployment is much higher than that now, further downside is likely, Pantheon thinks.</li><li>The 12-month inflation expectations picked up to 5.3% from 4.5%, the highest since October 2014. Pantheon believes “the risk of a near-term increase in inflation is remote, and we see even less risk that people will be in a position to translate their inflation fears - if they persist - into faster wage growth, but these numbers need to be watched over the next few months.”</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback appears to have weathered the worst for now, or rather rival currencies seem to have run out of bullish momentum amidst more month end models flagging Buck selling for portfolio rebalancing. On that note, after moderate signals from one bank the latest from a Japanese institution is strong against all G10 currency counterparts based on a more pronounced rebound in US stocks. However, the <strong>DXY</strong> has pared some losses between 99.443-100.210 parameters ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC policy announcements, the accompanying statement with forward guidance and the post-meeting press conference from Chair Powell.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK/CAD</strong></p><p>The Swedish Crown has extended post-Riksbank gains to almost 10.7000 vs the Euro from close to 10.8600 at one stage following confirmation of no change in the benchmark repo rate, as widely forecast, but also no QE expansion or enhancements that a significant proportion were looking for. Moreover, the projected path for the repo was maintained, albeit through 2021 rather than the normal longer 3 year horizon given abnormally high uncertainty caused by the coronavirus. Hence, a hawkish hold even though the Bank and Governor Ingves stressed that easing remains an option if deemed necessary. Meanwhile, a firmer recovery in oil and the aforementioned favourable month end factors propelled the Norwegian Krona up towards 11.2500 compared to around 11.4140 against the single currency and the Loonie beyond 1.3950 vs its US peer before crude topped out again.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/EUR/NZD/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>All holding the bulk of their advances relative to the US Dollar, but with the Aussie unable to sustain its move above 0.6500 and Yen retreating ahead of 106.50 after its stop-driven rally through 107.00 following only brief consideration of comments from Japanese Finance Minister Aso alluding to uncertainty over the Jpy’s value against the backdrop or interest rate stability and expansive fiscal policy. Elsewhere, the Euro ran into resistance in the high 1.0800 area pre-ECB and the Kiwi was hampered by extremely dovish RBNZ vibes awaiting NZ trade data, as Westpac said the key rate could be slashed to -0.5% before the end of 2020. In contrast, the Franc and Pound both benefited from Greenback weakness early in the session, but were volatile in Euro cross terms, mindful of ongoing intervention and reports that the EU believes trade talks with the UK have reached stalemate respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Choppy trade for the Rub and Mxn in line with oil price fluctuations, while the Try slipped through 7.0000 again before more likely Turkish bank selling to protect the psychological level, but the Brl outperformed after Brazil’s Supreme Court approved a motion to probe President Bolsonaro put forward by ex-Justice Minister Moro, perhaps on the premise that allegations about police investigation interference may provide some clarity and curb his actions.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>OPEN SNAPSHOT: </strong>Stocks are firmer amid optimism around economies reopening; US equities have opened firmer, although the NDX is lagging (REGN and VRTX lead losses after a downgrade, while some key earnings are awaited; &nbsp;TSLA and NFLX are also weighing). &nbsp;The majority of sectors trade in positive territory today with Financials and Industrials leading the pack with the former finding tailwinds from S&amp;P Global (SPGI) and T-Row Price (TROW) earnings. Industrials being led by Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Cummins (CMI). Health Care is the only sector in negative territory weighed on by Merck (MRK) who cut guidance. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>&nbsp;Caterpillar (CAT) beat on EPS, missed on revenue and withdrew its guidance, adding roughly 75% of its facilities are still operating and it has USD 7.1bln of cash and USD 10.5bln in credit facilities. 3M (MMM) beat on top and bottom line and reduced its FY20 CapEx plan to prioritize its investment and dividends, although it has suspended its share repurchase programme. Merck (MRK) saw top and bottom-line beats although lowered its FY20 forecasts beneath expectations. MRK’s Keytruda sales were firmer than expected, as was its Gardasil, although Januvia+Janumet were slightly short. Pfizer (PFE) also saw top and bottom-line beats, while reaffirming its FY20 adj. EPS forecast, adding it has not seen a significant disruption in its supply chain. Its drug sales for Eliquis and Ibrance were firmer than expected, and its Prevenar revenue grew 11% Y/Y despite an expected fall of 1.1%. NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) beat on EPS although revenue fell slightly short of expectations. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) has cancelled its plans to bring employees back to work at its Fremont, California plant. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) launched a consumer-initiated COVID-19 antibody test which can be purchased online without going to the doctors. Boeing Company (BA) says to restart 787 operations in South Carolina with most teammates returning May 3rd or 4th, and resumption includes all operation that were temporarily suspended on April 8th due to coronavirus. Boeing expects to see fuel costs in Q2 at 1.00-1.10 per gallon. Raytheon Technologies (RTX) increased its quarterly dividend to USD 0.475/shr from USD 0.3528/shr. &nbsp;Netflix (NFLX) weighed on as further re-opening updates emerge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE FOCUS: </strong>Another batch of index heavyweights reported on Tuesday morning and withdrew guidance (MMM and CAT, notably). There has not been much impact on the index, and that is due to the fact that traders are continuing to eye the macro narrative for cues. As we have noted previously, the focus is on economies reopening (likely staggered, which lends to a U-shape recovery theory), the shape of the recovery, and provisions for testing, while there will also be a close eye on reinfections. Results from Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir trial in severe patients is due by month-end and will likely serve as a liquidity event for risk assets. There is also increasing attention on the next tranche of fiscal stimulus, which should become more of a focus next week when the Senate returns (support for States and local governments, seems to be the focus, although traders are hopeful for updates on infrastructure spending, as well as support for the energy sector); Senate Majority leader McConnell has vowed that a next stimulus bill will not pass until all Senators have returned to Washington. It is not yet determined when the House will return. Elsewhere, this week’s confabs from the Fed (Wednesday, preview here) and ECB (Thursday, preview here) are on the radar. And with regards to equity specifics, big earnings are also awaited (aftermarket: GOOG, AMD, SBUX, F; on Wednesday, BA, TSLA, FB; Thursday AMZN, AAPL). &nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW TO POSITION FOR THE RECOVERY:</strong> As attention shifts away from death tolls and case counts onto reopening economies and reinfection rates some have questioned what the equity market is discounting in terms of the shape of the recovery. SocGen’s strategists say that an ‘intermediate lockdown’ scenario is on the brink of being priced in, and the bank finds that a one-and-a-half month ‘soft lockdown’ scenario is fully priced in, which is not the case yet for an ‘intermediate lockdown’ (two-and-half months, as seen in Wuhan). “Such a scenario could potentially have a -31% impact on S&amp;P 500 net income,” the bank warns, and argues that a V-shape recovery is not priced in; “rather than hopes for a V-shaped recovery, the low interest rate environment and lockdown situation explain most of the rally on the US equity market.” In the bank’s baseline scenario of peak contagion in 2Q and an orderly exit of lockdowns paving the way for a V-shaped recovery in growth in 2021, it recommends the positioning for a rotation into cyclicals in H2 2020 (long S&amp;P 500 and S&amp;P 400 MidCaps vs Nasdaq 100) and for small caps to continue underperforming large (long S&amp;P 500 vs Russell 2000). &nbsp;</p><p><strong>TECHNICAL/MONTH-END BUYING:</strong> After global equity markets gained yesterday, and are up on Tuesday, Nomura’s quant desk argues that bears are finding this an unappealing time to enter. The equity rally seems technical, Nomura says, and is being led by trend-following algos (CTAs and risk parity funds); “the machines may be getting back into the market, but human investors appear to be taking their time,” and “with human market participants staying at home (both literally and figuratively), the machines have proceeded on their own to systematically buy up equities. Its quant strategists say that risk parity funds appear to be raising allocation to both EM and DM equities in the context of month-end rebalancing. “However, we think it best to assume that these risk-parity funds are buying equities simply as the default alternative to the high-yield bonds they have been selling.” Meanwhile, trend-chasing CTAs appear to be backing out of 10-year UST futures; “Should the 10-year UST yield make its way up to around 0.84%, CTAs could be dragged into a Treasury future sell-off that sends yields even higher.” &nbsp;</p>",

However, the DXY remains under pressure with the index rooted to the base of a 100.210-99.443 range awaiting the Wall Street open and consumer confidence that is seen considerably lower than previously for obvious reasons.</p>",

        "subject": "US PRE-MARKET MACRO: Risk on, traders ignore heavyweights withdrawing guidance given other risk events in focus; month-end/technical buying; positioning for the recovery",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>MARKET SNAPSHOT: </strong>European equity bourses are rallying, with optimism around economies reopening said to be supporting sentiment; US equity futures are up by over 1%. The dollar is on track for a fourth day of losses, and some think what happens within equities will dictate USD price action going forward. Yields are modestly higher on the Treasury curve, though major curve spreads are not deviating too far from neutral. Prompt oil prices are collapsing (nothing new here, storage jitters and USO’s investment adjustments are driving the action), but prices from July out have firmed a decent amount; there will be attention on inventories after market, particularly on stocks at the Cushing hub. Note that this week other assets have been unphased by the recent oil swings, compared to last week where wider risk appetite was also hit.</li><li><strong>THE FOCUS: </strong>Another batch of index heavyweights reported on Tuesday morning and withdrew guidance (MMM and CAT, notably). There has not been much impact on the index, and that is due to the fact that traders are continuing to eye the macro narrative for cues. As we have noted previously, the focus is on economies reopening (likely staggered, which lends to a U-shape recovery theory), the shape of the recovery, and provisions for testing, while there will also be a close eye on reinfections. Results from Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir trial in severe patients is due by month-end and will likely serve as a liquidity event for risk assets. There is also increasing attention on the next tranche of fiscal stimulus, which should become more of a focus next week when the Senate returns (support for States and local governments, seems to be the focus, although traders are hopeful for updates on infrastructure spending, as well as support for the energy sector); Senate Majority leader McConnell has vowed that a next stimulus bill will not pass until all Senators have returned to Washington. It is not yet determined when the House will return. Elsewhere, this week’s confabs from the Fed (Wednesday, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24377/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">preview here</a>) and ECB (Thursday, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24387/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">preview here</a>) are on the radar. And with regards to equity specifics, big earnings are also awaited (aftermarket: GOOG, AMD, SBUX, F; on Wednesday, BA, TSLA, FB; Thursday AMZN, AAPL).</li><li><strong>HOW TO POSITION FOR THE RECOVERY: </strong>As attention shifts away from death tolls and case counts onto reopening economies and reinfection rates some have questioned what the equity market is discounting in terms of the shape of the recovery. SocGen’s strategists say that an ‘intermediate lockdown’ scenario is on the brink of being priced in, and the bank finds that a one-and-a-half month ‘soft lockdown’ scenario is fully priced in, which is not the case yet for an ‘intermediate lockdown’ (two-and-half months, as seen in Wuhan). “Such a scenario could potentially have a -31% impact on S&amp;P 500 net income,” the bank warns, and argues that a V-shape recovery is not priced in; “rather than hopes for a V-shaped recovery, the low interest rate environment and lockdown situation explain most of the rally on the US equity market.” In the bank’s baseline scenario of peak contagion in 2Q and an orderly exit of lockdowns paving the way for a V-shaped recovery in growth in 2021, it recommends the positioning for a rotation into cyclicals in H2 2020 (long S&amp;P 500 and S&amp;P 400 MidCaps vs Nasdaq 100) and for small caps to continue underperforming large (long S&amp;P 500 vs Russell 2000).</li><li><strong>TECHNICAL/MONTH-END BUYING: </strong>After global equity markets gained yesterday, and are up on Tuesday, Nomura’s quant desk argues that bears are finding this an unappealing time to enter. The equity rally seems technical, Nomura says, and is being led by trend-following algos (CTAs and risk parity funds); “the machines may be getting back into the market, but human investors appear to be taking their time,” and “with human market participants staying at home (both literally and figuratively), the machines have proceeded on their own to systematically buy up equities. Its quant strategists say that risk parity funds appear to be raising allocation to both EM and DM equities in the context of month-end rebalancing. “However, we think it best to assume that these risk-parity funds are buying equities simply as the default alternative to the high-yield bonds they have been selling.” Meanwhile, trend-chasing CTAs appear to be backing out of 10-year UST futures; “Should the 10-year UST yield make its way up to around 0.84%, CTAs could be dragged into a Treasury future sell-off that sends yields even higher.”</li></ul>",

The largest weighted banking sector also added to the indecision with NAB on the backfoot as it resumed trade post-earnings and after the completion of its AUD 3bln placement, although Westpac surged despite flagging a AUD 2.2bln impairment for H1. <strong>Nikkei 225 (U/C)</strong> was lacklustre as participants digested earnings releases, while <strong>Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%)</strong> conformed to the choppy price action as focus turned to corporate updates and with participants kept tentative ahead of the blue chip banking names set to announce results this week beginning with HSBC which reported Q1 profit before tax fell nearly 50% Y/Y. Finally, 10yr JGBs were range-bound with prices restricted by resistance ahead of the 153.00 level and following the latest Rinban announcement in which the central bank upped its purchase intentions of 1yr-10yr JGBs but had recently reduced the frequency of purchases of 3yr-5yr maturities for next month.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net neutral on the day.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities extend gains after a relatively flat open (Euro Stoxx 50 +1.8%) </strong>after a rather mixed APAC session, with sentiment skewed more towards the upside as the session goes underway. Bourses are mostly comfortable in the green, although the IBEX (+1.1%) sees underperformance on account of some large-cap stocks in the red – with Utility names weighing on the Spanish index. Elsewhere in the periphery, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+2.5%) continues to benefit after the country dodged a debt downgrade by S&amp;P. Looking at sectors, Energy initially underperformoned but has since outpaced its peers to reside as a top performer amid the rebound in the energy complex. Financials outperform with the aid of higher yields and some more-upbeat earnings from regional banks. UBS (+5.7%) and Santander (+3.4%) trade firmer amid some bullish internals, although the former also saw improvements in Q1 pre-tax and Adj. pre-tax whilst highlighting high-quality credit exposure. On the flip side, HSBC (-0.5%) remains pressured as Q1 profits halved on increase loan loss provisions emanated from COVID-19. The bank also guides its FY20 to have materially lower profitability. Individual movers predominantly consist of other large-cap stocks post-earnings; BP (-1.9%) reported a 66% decline in Q1 earnings as it was hit by the plunge in energy prices – with the oil behemoth also anticipating a material impact in Q2 downstream from the pandemic. Novartis (+0.9%) has trimmed some of its opening gains but remains underpinned as top and bottom line topped estimates, with a favourable sales impact of USD 400mln expected from COVID-19. Aside from earnings, Wirecard (-19.7%) shares fell despite KPMG’s special report not identifying incriminating evidence for public allegation of balance sheet forgery – with downside potentially induced by the audit noting that not all data could be obtained that would have been required to proof revenue in these years as required data are primarily controlled by third parties. Furthermore, the Co. has delayed its earnings release and presser – originally due on April 30th. Finally, Lufthansa (-0.2%) was initially bolstered by reports that the German gov’t is to present a EUR 9bln rescue package for the Co. and the Swiss gov’t agreeing to a CHF 1.5bln support package via state-backed loans, although sources later downplayed an agreement on Germany’s aid, although separate reports noted that the Co. is said to be mulling insolvency proceedings as an alternative option.</p><p><strong>Caterpillar Inc (CAT)</strong> Q1 20 (USD): EPS 1.98 (exp. 1.68), Revenue -21% Y/Y at 10.64bln (exp. 10.92bln).

Some were looking for an increase in asset purchases or an extension in the schedule beyond the current end of September timeframe, and more than just another pledge to lower rates if required, so Eur/Sek has fallen from pre-policy pronouncement levels through the 55 DMA (10.8110) and Fib support (10.7999) on the way down to circa 10.7800, thus far. Meanwhile, the Yen paused at the psychological 107.00 mark again in wake of comments from Japan’s Ministry of Finance raising uncertainty about the currency’s value given stable interest rates despite high levels of Government spending, but Usd/Jpy subsequently breached the round number and supposedly strong technical levels just below amidst a stop-fuelled run to around 106.60 and eying a 50% retracement to 106.45 next, assuming 106.50 is pierced first.

Furthermore, the S&amp;P GSCI Commodity Index announced that it will be moving all WTI exposure away from June. Desks note that the funds’ moves highlight a trend among market participants, with little-to-no demand in the contract amid fears of a repetition of deep negative prices seen heading into the May expiry. For reference, June WTI is set to expire on May 19th. “The move we are seeing suggests that the Jun-20 contract is going to become increasingly illiquid, and as a result, will likely suffer from increased volatility in the lead up to expiry”, ING writes. Meanwhile, eyes will be on today’s API release with attention on the Cushing figure as a gauge of when the WTI delivery hub will reach full capacity – “If we see similar builds to the last few weeks, we will likely reach full capacity at Cushing over the first half of May”, the Dutch bank says. WTI June trades lower by some 20% and printed a current base at USD 10.13/bbl (vs. high USD 13.18), whilst its Brent counterpart initially follows suit, albeit to a much lesser extent, with prices now in positive territory around the top of today’s USD 18.73-20.86/bbl range.

Bourses are mostly comfortable in the green, although the IBEX (+1.1%) sees underperformance on account of some large-cap stocks in the red – with Utility names weighing on the Spanish index. Elsewhere in the periphery, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+2.5%) continues to benefit after the country dodged a debt downgrade by S&amp;P. Looking at sectors, Energy initially underperformoned but has since outpaced its peers to reside as a top performer amid the rebound in the energy complex. Financials outperform with the aid of higher yields and some more-upbeat earnings from regional banks. UBS (+5.7%) and Santander (+3.4%) trade firmer amid some bullish internals, although the former also saw improvements in Q1 pre-tax and Adj. pre-tax whilst highlighting high-quality credit exposure. On the flip side, HSBC (-0.5%) remains pressured as Q1 profits halved on increase loan loss provisions emanated from COVID-19. The bank also guides its FY20 to have materially lower profitability. Individual movers predominantly consist of other large-cap stocks post-earnings; BP (-1.9%) reported a 66% decline in Q1 earnings as it was hit by the plunge in energy prices – with the oil behemoth also anticipating a material impact in Q2 downstream from the pandemic. Novartis (+0.9%) has trimmed some of its opening gains but remains underpinned as top and bottom line topped estimates, with a favourable sales impact of USD 400mln expected from COVID-19. Aside from earnings, Wirecard (-19.7%) shares fell despite KPMG’s special report not identifying incriminating evidence for public allegation of balance sheet forgery – with downside potentially induced by the audit noting that not all data could be obtained that would have been required to proof revenue in these years as required data are primarily controlled by third parties. Furthermore, the Co. has delayed its earnings release and presser – originally due on April 30th. Finally, Lufthansa (-0.2%) was initially bolstered by reports that the German gov’t is to present a EUR 9bln rescue package for the Co. and the Swiss gov’t agreeing to a CHF 1.5bln support package via state-backed loans, although sources later downplayed an agreement on Germany’s aid, although separate reports noted that the Co. is said to be mulling insolvency proceedings as an alternative option.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>SEK/JPY/NZD - All taking cues from Central Bank and monetary authority directives, to an extent, as the Swedish Krona responds to relatively hawkish or less dovish than anticipated Riksbank guidance after rates were left on hold alongside current QE remits and a truncated repo path due to high levels of uncertainty over the outlook due to COVID-19.

However, UK bonds remain relatively buoyant after yet more well received DMO issuance and the Eurozone periphery hopeful ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting as the more immediate global Central Bank focus switches to day one of the FOMC after a relatively ‘hawkish’ Riksbank. More immediately, US data and the 7 year auction before API crude/product inventories.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>SEK/JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>All taking cues from Central Bank and monetary authority directives, to an extent, as the Swedish Krona responds to relatively hawkish or less dovish than anticipated Riksbank guidance after rates were left on hold alongside current QE remits and a truncated repo path due to high levels of uncertainty over the outlook due to COVID-19. Some were looking for an increase in asset purchases or an extension in the schedule beyond the current end of September timeframe, and more than just another pledge to lower rates if required, so Eur/Sek has fallen from pre-policy pronouncement levels through the 55 DMA (10.8110) and Fib support (10.7999) on the way down to circa 10.7800, thus far. Meanwhile, the Yen paused at the psychological 107.00 mark again in wake of comments from Japan’s Ministry of Finance raising uncertainty about the currency’s value given stable interest rates despite high levels of Government spending, but Usd/Jpy subsequently breached the round number and supposedly strong technical levels just below amidst a stop-fuelled run to around 106.60 and eying a 50% retracement to 106.45 next, assuming 106.50 is pierced first. Conversely, the Kiwi has been undermined by an aggressive call from Westpac on RBNZ rates looking for -0.5% by this November vs market expectations via OIS pricing for just a 25 bp ease between now and Q1 next year. Hence, Nzd/Usd struggling to rebound much further above 0.6050 from sub-0.6000 overnight lows even though the Greenback is broadly softer.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/AUD/EUR/CHF/NOK</strong></p><p>Cable has peered over 1.2500 amidst general, albeit moderate Usd selling for month end from one rebalancing model exacerbated by the aforementioned Yen outperformance, but Sterling has also clawed back more losses against the Euro with the cross back down 0.8700 as the single currency is capped ahead of 1.0900 and the <strong>DXY </strong>finds a degree of underlying support at 99.5000. Elsewhere, the Loonie has derived momentum and encouragement from a firm rebound in crude alongside overall risk sentiment to reclaim 1.4000+ status and the Aussie eclipsed 0.6500 at one stage with favourable Aud/Nzd tailwinds through 1.0700 and touching 1.0750. The oil price revival has also helped the Norwegian Crown, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso rally, while even the Swiss Franc has nursed some recent losses vs the Buck, though has extended its post-sight deposit retreat against the Euro to 1.0612 or so.</p>",

Analysts at UBS calculate that this week’s cash flows will total USD 98bln, including around USD 89bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons; UBS notes that in the week of 11th May, there is around USD 86bln of cash falling due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and around USD 29bln of coupons. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>MONDAY's 2-YEAR AND 5-YEAR AUCTIONS: </strong>The US Treasury sold both 2-year and 5-year notes on Monday - both solid auctions that stopped-through the screens on decent demand. Starting with the former, which was sold at 0.229% (from the prior 0.39%), stopping-through by a chunky 1.3bps - the largest amount since July 2012; cover was 3.1x, the highest since January 2018. Direct participation was in line with recent averages, and indirects took a higher share than recent sales, leaving dealers with the lowest since last November. The 5s auction was similar, but to a lesser extent, stopping through by 0.7bps. &nbsp;Both auctions highlight that, despite projections of the US deficit rising to above USD 3trln in 2020, demand is still strong for shorter-dated Treasuries; some have suggested that this is as the market eyes potential yield curve control from the Fed, which isn’t likely to be a feature of Wednesday’s confab, though will be a key issue into the June FOMC, where some believe that the Fed might pledge to leave rates at the effective lower bound for a couple of years, supported by its action in controlling short-term yields.</p><p><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Some desks suggests that, while the 7-year trades fair in asset swap, it is expensive outright, and the current WI is trading below all stop-out rates on record. SocGen's analysts observe that both the 2s7s and 5s7s curve has flattened since the last cycle. which may indicate richness of the 7-year sectors vs the 2s and 5s. Additionally, SocGen says that low dealer holdings and strong metrics seen in the March cycle are positives, although it holds a slight negative bias going into the auction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECENT 7-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY: &nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.680%, six-auction average 1.451%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -2.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.76x, six-auction avg. 2.50x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 28.6%, six-auction avg. 22.5%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 9.1%, six-auction avg. 14.6%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 62.4%, six-auction avg. 63.0%)</li></ul>",

        "subject": "PRIMER: Riksbank Rate Decision, expected unchanged at 0.0%. 08:30BST/09:30CET",
        "content": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><ul><li>Expectations are predominantly for rates to be left unchanged at 0.0%, 23/25 banks polled by Reuters forecast this; but notably, 2/25 banks call for a 25bp cut to -0.25%. As such, the potential for a rate cut, or at least a clear signal for the possibility of one ahead cannot be entirely ignored. Since the previous meeting in February a number of QE/liquidity measures have been announced and desks are mixed on whether these will be updated at this month’s meeting; with some calls for as much as a doubling of the purchase remit and for an extension, by various magnitudes, of the current 1-year timeframe. Recent data has unsurprisingly been poor; but notably, very little in the way of timely hard data has been released to-date so a detailed picture of the domestic situation is hard to precisely ascertain. Nonetheless, the available data is more than sufficient to justify additional policy action/guidance in some form; but, given recent announcements, the Bank may feel it pertinent to save its ammo for a clearer picture of COVID-19’s effects and to see how well current intervention has worked.</li></ul><p><strong>Current Policy Measures</strong></p><ul><li>Rates are currently at 0.0% after the Bank moved out of its negative interest rate policy late last year; since then rates have remained unchanged in spite of global easing given COVID-19. However, a number of other emergency policy measures have been taken, and most notably SEK 300bln of QE, to be completed by year-end, which would almost double total holdings if fully undertaken (vs SEK 340bln currently). In terms of QE at present, the Riksbank will also acquire corporate and mortgage bonds for the first time. Other pertinent policy action has revolved around shoring up liquidity for the Swedish banking sector through the provision to borrow unlimited funds on a weekly time-frame at a 0.20pp rate.</li></ul><p><strong>Potential Policy Action(s)</strong></p><ul><li>While expectations are for rates to be left unchanged, given the global easing bias, poor domestic situation and recent comments from the Governor, a move lower cannot be entirely ruled out; for instance, SEB ascribe around a 30% chance to a 25bp rate cut which would be coupled with open-ended QE purchases. Continuing with balance sheet policy, desks note that on-balance the Riksbank are unlikely to make changes at this meeting, given their willingness to hold ad-hoc meetings as/when is necessary for such announcements. However, SEB foresee around a 60% chance that QE purchases are doubled to SEK 600bln and allowed to run for as long as is necessary to provide enough liquidity support. From a more general point of interest for QE, the Riksbank are yet to formally outline guidance around the distribution of the purchases, so attention will be on any hints/details about composition. Elsewhere, the repo rate path currently contains a 10bp hike in 2022; at the very least, desks look for this to be removed, and perhaps a tweaking of expectations in the nearer term as a means to illustrate the potential for a rate cut, if deemed necessary.</li></ul><p><strong>Commentary</strong></p><ul><li>Remarks, which remains relevant, since the previous meeting have largely emanated from Governor Ingves who has made clear that they are prepared to undertake whatever action is necessary, but that there is resistance to moving back into negative rate territory. However, and interestingly for the Governor who was one of the main advocates for departing negative rates amongst the policy board, Ingves has stated that rate cuts and currency intervention can be undertaken as is necessary. With regards to a potential rate cut, given the well-known divisions amongst the ‘hawkish’ and ‘dovish’ members of the executive board, Nordea’s analysts highlight the possibility of Governor Ingves having to use his casting vote in such a scenario, but ultimately still call for all policy (including balance sheet operations) to remain unchanged this time around; as such, attention will be on the vote spilt, irrespective of the overall decision.</li></ul><p><strong>Data</strong></p><ul><li>Unsurprisingly, the domestic data situation is very weak. The most notable and timely release so far being the April Economic Sentiment Indicator which saw the business sector component drop to its lowest ever level, while other components within the release were similarly grim. Somewhat backward-looking data for March include PMIs printing significantly below the previous readings and moving into contractionary territory; while, CPIF and unemployment readings were marginally better than expected, albeit still very soft. Particularly, the CPIF print was significantly below the Riksbank’s own forecast, at 0.6% vs. 1.4% YY; note, the Riksbank forecast is from February and as such is heavily outdated. In terms of the economic outlook, SEB believe that the Riksbank will provide forecasts relatively in-line with IMF projections for the global economy – namely, GDP -6.0% and CPIF at 0.5% for 2020; albeit, with a strong rebound in 2021.</li></ul>",

(Newswires) Banks are said to expect the next round of PPP stimulus loans to run out in days, while financial firms and brokers are still applying for money, according to FBN's Gasparino. Furthermore, Gasparino tweeted that talk of next wave of virus-related stimulus to include another USD 1trln in spending and that something known as a “negative payroll tax” is definitely on the table.

Furthermore, the Governor added that retail stores, bars and restaurants will be reopened on May 1st but at a 25% occupancy limit.

(Times)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p>Asian equity markets were mixed as a deluge of earnings and continued oil rout offset the momentum from Wall St. where the major indices were underpinned by reopening efforts and ongoing stimulus measures. ASX 200 (-0.9%) swung between gains and losses with the index pressured by underperformance in the commodity-related sectors as oil prices suffered double-digit losses on continued demand concerns and after the USO announced to dump all its June contracts by mid-week in favour of later-dated contracts. The largest weighted banking sector also added to the indecision with NAB on the backfoot as it resumed trade post-earnings and after the completion of its AUD 3bln placement, although Westpac surged despite flagging a AUD 2.2bln impairment for H1. Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) was lacklustre as participants digested earnings releases, while Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) also conformed to the choppy price action as focus turned to corporate updates and with participants kept tentative ahead of the blue chip banking names set to announce results this week beginning with HSBC which reported Q1 profit before tax fell nearly 50% Y/Y. Finally, 10yr JGBs were range-bound with prices restricted by resistance ahead of the 153.00 level and following the latest Rinban announcement in which the central bank upped its purchase intentions of 1yr-10yr JGBs but had recently reduced the frequency of purchases of 3yr-5yr maturities for next month.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net neutral on the day.

(Newswires)</p><p>UK Lloyds Business Barometer (Apr) -32 (Prev. 6). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>The DXY was marginally firmer after support at the 100.00 level just about held but with price action limited ahead of Wednesday’s Q1 GDP growth data and FOMC meeting. In addition, there were recent comments from White House Advisor Hassett that suggested Q2 GDP will be the worst reading since the Depression with a likely contraction of 20%-30% and Barclays noted its month-end rebalancing model pointed to moderate USD selling. EUR/USD and GBP/USD were relatively quiet at the 1.0800 and 1.2400 handles respectively with the single currency stuck in between its 100-Hour and 200-Hour MA levels, while GBP/USD lacked firm direction after the return of UK PM Johnson to Downing Street. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was lacklustre amid the indecisive risk tone, with the pair just south of a large USD 3.2bln option expiry at 107.50 rolling off at today’s New York cut, and antipodeans were subdued due to their high beta statuses and with NZD/USD the underperformer following a recent note by Westpac which suggested further action from the RBNZ will be required in the future and forecasts the OCR to be lowered into negative territory of -0.5% later this year from the current 0.25%.</p><p>Australian Treasury said they are not working on any new economic packages at this time although Treasury Secretary Kennedy commented that Australia will distribute AUD 30bln in stimulus to households over the next month. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> crude futures extended on its rout with another double-digit percentage loss to briefly break below USD 11.00/bbl on continued demand concerns and after the USO recently announced to exit all its June contracts within a 3-day period in favour of longer-dated contracts, with the fund now looking to take up some allocations in October, December and even as far as the June 2021 contract. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were subdued and fell below the USD 1700/oz level amid the mild gains in the greenback and with China’s consumption of the precious metal down 48% Y/Y in Q1, while copper was indecisive alongside the mixed overnight risk appetite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mexico's state-run Pemex trading arm PMI, considers options to sharply reduce fuel purchases during May-June with options including declaring a force majeure, negotiating cargo cancellations and rescheduling, as well as lowering demurrage fee payments.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, amid a constructive risk backdrop which was supported by optimism on the easing of lockdown restrictions. Although the FOMC meeting this week is only expected to “take stock” of the situation, with no major announcement expected, desks will, however, be keeping an eye on any commentary regarding Japanese/Australian-style YCC on the horizon. The US Treasury sold both 2-year and 5-year notes - both solid auctions that stopped-through the screens on decent demand. Starting with the former, which was sold at 0.229% (from the prior 0.39%), stopping-through by a chunky 1.3bps - the largest amount since July 2012; cover was 3.1x, the highest since January 2018. Direct participation was in line with recent averages, and indirects took a higher share than recent sales, leaving dealers with the lowest since last November. The 5s auction was similar, but to a lesser extent, stopping through by 0.7bps.&nbsp; Both auctions highlight that, despite projections of the US deficit rising to above USD 3trln in 2020, demand is still strong for shorter-dated Treasuries; some have suggested that this is as the market eyes potential yield curve control from the Fed, which isn’t likely to be a feature of Wednesday’s confab, though will be a key issue into the June FOMC, where some believe that the Fed might pledge to leave rates at the effective lower bound for a couple of years, supported by its action in controlling short-term yields. T-notes (M0) settled 14+ ticks lower at 138-21.</p><p><strong>Fed expanded scope and duration of municipal liquidity facility and increased the duration of eligible securities to 3 years from 2 years,</strong> while it widened the scope to cover counties with populations of at least 500k (Prev. 2mln) and cities of 250k residents (Prev. 1mln), and will consider expanding facility to include limited number of government entities that issue revenue bonds. Furthermore, it noted that it is to lend as much as USD 500bln under the facility on USD 35bln of Treasury equity and that the changes will permit substantially more entities to borrow. (Newswires)</p><p>White House Advisor Hassett said the US economy will not see a V-shaped recovery without another stimulus bill. Furthermore, he earlier stated that Q2 GDP will be the largest negative number since the great depression and likely between -20 to -30%, although Q3 will likely be positive. (Newswires)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as a deluge of earnings and continued oil rout offsets the momentum from Wall St where all major indices were underpinned by reopening efforts and following the BoJ’s additional policy measures. ASX 200 (Unch.) swung between gains and losses with the index pressured by underperformance in the commodity-related sectors as oil prices suffered double-digit losses on continued demand concerns and after the USO announced to dump all its June contracts by mid-week in favour of later-dated contracts. The largest weighted banking sector also adds to the indecision with NAB on the backfoot as it resumes trade post-earnings and completion of its AUD 3bln placement, although Westpac surges despite flagging a AUD 2.2bln impairment for H1. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is lacklustre as participants digest earnings releases, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) also conform to the choppy price action as focus also turns to corporate updates and with participants kept tentative ahead of the blue chip banking names set to announce results this week beginning with HSBC later today at the Hong Kong lunch break.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is marginally firmer after support at the 100.00 level just about held but with price action limited ahead of Wednesday’s Q1 GDP growth data and FOMC meeting. In addition, there were recent comments from White House Advisor Hassett that suggested Q2 GDP will be the worst reading since the Depression with a likely contraction of 20%-30% and Barclays noted its month-end rebalancing model pointed to moderate USD selling. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are relatively quiet at the 1.0800 and 1.2400 handles respectively with the single currency stuck in between its 100-Hour and 200-Hour MA levels, while GBP/USD lacks firm direction after the return of UK PM Johnson who suggested the UK was passing the peak of coronavirus but also suggested this was the moment of maximum risk and that they cannot determine when changes can occur which quelled recent speculation of an early lifting of the lockdown. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is lacklustre amid the indecisive risk tone and with the pair just south of a large USD 3.2bln option expiry at 107.50 rolling off at today’s New York Cut, and antipodeans are subdued due to their high beta statuses and with NZD/USD underperforming following a recent note by Westpac which noted further action from the RBNZ will be required later this year and forecasts the OCR to be lowered into negative territory of -0.5% later this year from the current 0.25%.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are range-bound with prices restricted by resistance ahead of the 153.00 level and following the latest Rinban announcement in which the central bank upped its purchase intentions of 1yr-10yr JGBs but had also recently reduced the frequency of purchases of 3yr-5yr maturities for next month.</p>",
