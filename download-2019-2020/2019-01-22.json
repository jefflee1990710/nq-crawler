However, NEC Director Kudlow denied the report that the US has turned down a China offer for preparatory trade talks and noted the big meeting will be at the end of January with the Chinese Vice-Premier, while Kudlow also stated that enforcement of deadlines and timetable is crucial to the success of China talks. (FT/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Foreign Ministry said it will respond according to action taken by the US when asked about a retaliation against the US if Huawei CFO Meng is extradited and commented that what the US did is wrong.

However, McConnell&#39;s office later stated that the NYT report of a shutdown deal is inaccurate and that Trump&rsquo;s stance on shutdown fight is unchanged, while reports also noted that neither parties think there are enough votes to pass the bill.

In afternoon trade the belly and long-end of the curve hit fresh session highs after the FT announced the US turned down a China offer of preparatory trade talks over lack of progress. Finally, Existing Home Sales were the lowest since 2015 and thus contributed to upside in the complex.

The cancellation of the trip to Washington emphasizes difficulties the two sides are facing in reaching a deal by March, according to the piece, although China&#39;s Liu Hei was said to continue preparations for the Jan 30th -31st visit. The report was denied by NEC Director Kudlow in an interview with CNBC who emphasized the big meeting with China will be at the end of the month. He went on to say that they are having fulsome discussion going with China on intellectual property matters and that enforcement is crucial in talks. In earlier comments, US Secretary of State Pompeo announced he does not see a China conflict as inevitable and noted that their relationship will be determined by American principles and fair trade. He is hopeful that China will adopt consistent policies, and if so, he is confident that they can thrive together. Elsewhere, Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland stated that Canada will drop tariffs immediately if the US drops its own steel tariffs and stressed that China tensions are a central concern for her country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* HUAWEI: </strong>Overnight, Canadian press reported that the US is to seek extradition of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO Meng Wanzhou, who has been held under house arrest in Canada over trade sanction violations since December; this was later confirmed by the DoJ. China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said what the US is doing is wrong and will respond accordingly. In related comments, Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland stated that the Huawei CEO will be treated fairly in Canada courts and they will be the ones deciding if the US charge is valid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> MPs are attempting to change the course of Brexit, after PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal was rejected, by tabling &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; amendments that may be selected and voted on in Parliament next Tuesday, on Jan 29th. The amendments include preventing a no deal scenario, extending Article 50 as well as opening the possibility to a second referendum. The latter has been proposed by Opposition leader Corbyn and therefore it has a high probability of being selected for a vote, but unlikely to pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>US President Trump has reportedly begun interviewing new candidates for the open Fed board seat. Elsewhere, IMF&#39;s Lagarde believes that the Fed&#39;s patient approach is positive for growth; she also warned that tightening is not going to be as quick as was initially thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EXISTING HOME SALES</strong> fell to 4.99mln in December from 5.25mln while the prior was revised higher to 5.33mln. Analysts at Pantheon note that the expected figure was &ldquo;baffling&rdquo; due to the recent pending home sales index pointing to a drop, &ldquo;Sales are now running far below the 5.1M or so implied by the mortgage applications numbers, probably as a result of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, the California wildfires, and the much colder-than-usual weather in November.&rdquo; Due to these seasonal dips, we can expect a rebound in Q1 figures to the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (G9) SETTLE USD 1.23 LOWER AT USD 52.57/BBL, BRENT FUTURES (H9) SETTLE USD 1.24 LOWER AT USD 61.50/BBL. </strong>Oil prices remained under pressure on Tuesday as risk-aversion returned in markets following US closure on Monday due to Martin Luther King Day. Global slowdown fear is lingering in the background and was exacerbated the by softest Chinese GDP print in 28 years. On the matter, Citi is &ldquo;hearing some related market chatter that the growth in China&rsquo;s crude oil and LNG imports may slow as well&rdquo; however emphasizing that &ldquo;today&rsquo;s weakness has only pulled prices back down into its prior consolidation range, not yet signalling a more material reversal&rdquo;. In early European trade, the energy complex saw a leg lower after Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih has reportedly cancelled his trip to Davos where he was due to hold talks on the recent OPEC+ production cuts with the Russian Energy Minister. Later in the session, Russia&#39;s Energy Minister Novak also cancelled his trip to the Swiss destination. Alongside this, Azerbaijan President says OPEC+ deal will maintain oil range of USD 60-70/bbl. Elsewhere, European refinery output at 11mln BPD in December +1% from November and -3% YY. As a reminder, WTI Feb futures expired today and weekly energy inventories are due tomorrow after market close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -1.41% at 2633, NASDAQ -2.03% at 6647, DJI -1.21% at 24407. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -2.20%, Materials -1.35%, Industrials -2.06%, Cons Discretionary -1.79%, Cons Staples -1.00%, Healthcare -0.70%, Financials -1.08%, Tech -1.76%, Telecoms -1.96%, Utilities +0.16%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Trade sensitive stocks from the industrial sector (BA, CAT, DE) and tech sector (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, INTC) pulled indices down after a pessimistic IMF growth forecast and declining China growth figures. The Energy sector traded in the red as crude prices dipped, weighed down also by Halliburton (HAL) after reporting disappointing North American sales. Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) tanked after giving profit guidance below estimates. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) opened lower following it reporting disappointing revenue guidance for 2019. Broker moves saw Altria Group (MO) and GAP (GPS) underperform after downgrades at Morgan Stanley and Goldman respectively, conversely, Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) outperformed after upgrades at Cowen and Goldman respectively. Arconic (ARNC) nosedived following it announcing it is no longer considering a sale of itself. eBay (EBAY) surged after activist investor proposed a growth strategy to the co.&rsquo;s board. Travelers (TRV) opened in the green on the back of reporting strong Q4 profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 13 TICKS HIGHER AT 121-18+. </strong>Treasuries were bid on Tuesday as risk-sentiment deteriorated amid renewed fear of a global slowdown following weak China growth GDP figures as well as growth downgrades by the IMF for 2019 and 2020. In afternoon trade the belly and long-end of the curve hit fresh session highs after the FT announced the US turned down a China offer of preparatory trade talks over lack of progress. Finally, Existing Home Sales were the lowest since 2015 and thus contributed to upside in the complex. The curve saw some modest bull-flattening with short-dated yields lower by c.3bps and long-dated yields lower by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed heading into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Dollar demand was experienced in early EU trade which coincided with comments from the Chinese Foreign Ministry regarding the Huawei CFO&rsquo;s extradition which sent the index to an intraday peak just shy of 96.500, though a tweet by the Global Times Editor aided the index to pare back gains. The index lost further ground in light of dismal December existing home sales numbers sent the DXY back through its 50 HMA at 96.350 to levels just shy of its intraday low at 96.310.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>Pound remained the outperformer as a receding Dollar and optimistic UK jobs data sent Cable to session highs at around 1.2975 (vs. low of 1.2850), while news has been thin on the Brexit front though the Pound received some impetus after BBC&rsquo;s Assistant Political Editor Smith tweeted that Ministers will have to sit through the February recess and weekends to achieve in deal in by the Brexit date, which markets could perceive as a positive as it potentially gives them more time to achieve an appropriate deal. Cable currently sitting around 1.2960. Meanwhile the EUR remained little changed against the Dollar as the single currency fails to benefit from the receding buck as gains are capped by the Sterling-induced decline in EUR/GBP following the aforementioned UK jobs data and Brexit developments, while the release of mixed ZEW number did little to move the single currency. EUR/USD remains flat around 1.1360 with sight on Thursday&rsquo;s ECB interest rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>High-beta currencies remained on the backfoot with the Aussie after the IMF cut forecasts for global growth yesterday citing trade tension. Throughout the day AUD/USD extended losses below 0.7150 to a low of 0.7121 before stabilising under 0.7140. Downside in the Aussie was exacerbated by the risk barometer AUD/JPY as safe heaven demand into the Yen sent the pair to test 77.90 at one point (vs high of 78.50). Meanwhile the Kiwi moved in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart ahead of New Zealand inflation data later today (expected to cool from prior quarter) where JP Morgan, Citi and State Street are calling for NZD shorts heading into the release. NZD/USD came off worst levels after having dropped to levels close to 0.6700 to the downside (vs. high of 0.6734). Finally, CAD is the G10 underperformer amid the decline in oil and the below-forecast wholesale trade and manufacturing trade numbers with USD/CAD ending the day closer to the top of a 1.3290-3350 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Overall a positive day for the Yen after the safe-haven currency was underpinned by the risk-averse tone and as the BoJ began their 2-day policy meeting (full preview available on the Research Suite). USD/JPY hovered just under 109.50 (vs. low of 109.30) with the pair&rsquo;s 50 and 200 DMAs on course to form a death-cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW:</strong> BoJ policy announcement due Wednesday 23rd January 2019. Consensus is one-sided for the central bank to keep negative interest rate policy at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0%. Sources have suggested the BoJ is set to trim its inflation outlook for the next 2 years. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20979/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Sterling shines as Brexit briefly took a backseat ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Dollar demand was experienced in early EU trade which coincided with comments from the Chinese Foreign Ministry regarding the Huawei CFO&rsquo;s extradition which sent the index to an intraday peak just shy of 96.500, though a tweet by the Global Times Editor aided the index to pare back gains. The index lost further ground in light of dismal December existing home sales numbers sent the DXY back through its 50 HMA at 96.350 to levels just shy of its intraday low at 96.310. Overall, the index is poised to end the day little changed around its 50 HMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G<strong>BP, EUR</strong> &ndash; Pound remained the outperformer as a receding Dollar and optimistic UK jobs data sent Cable to session highs of just under 1.2950 (vs. low of 1.2850), while news has been thin on the Brexit front though the Pound received some impetus after BBC&rsquo;s Assistant Political Editor Smith tweeted that Ministers will have to sit through the February recess and weekends to achieve in deal in by the Brexit date, which markets could perceive as a positive as it potentially gives them more time to achieve an appropriate deal. Cable is poised to end the day above its 100 DMA at 1.2891 ahead of the psychological 1.2900. Meanwhile the EUR remained little changed against the Dollar as the single currency fails to benefit from the receding buck as gains are capped by the Sterling-induced decline in EUR/GBP following the aforementioned UK jobs data and Brexit developments, while the release of mixed ZEW number did little to move the single currency. EUR/USD remains flat around 1.1360 with sight on Thursday&rsquo;s ECB interest rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong> &ndash; High-beta currencies remained on the backfoot with the Aussie after the IMF cut forecasts for global growth yesterday citing trade tension. Throughout the day AUD/USD extended losses below 0.7150 to a low of 0.7121 before stabilising just under 0.7140. Downside in the Aussie was exacerbated by the risk barometer AUD/JPY as safe heaven demand into the Yen sent the pair to test 77.90 at one point (vs high of 78.50). Meanwhile the Kiwi moved in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart ahead of New Zealand inflation data later today (expected to cool from prior quarter) where JP Morgan, Citi and State Street are calling for NZD shorts heading into the release. NZD/USD came off worst levels after having dropped to levels close to 0.6700 to the downside (vs. high of 0.6734). Finally, CAD is the G10 underperformer amid the decline in oil and the below-forecast wholesale trade and manufacturing trade numbers with USD/CAD poised to end the day closer to the top of a 1.3290-3350 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; Overall a positive day for the Yen after the safe-haven currency was underpinned by the risk-averse tone and as the BoJ began their 2-day policy meeting (full preview available on the Research Suite). USD/JPY hovered just under 109.50 (vs. low of 109.30) with the pair&rsquo;s 50 and 200 DMAs on course to form a death-cross.</p>\r\n",

UK 10-year futures have been uneventful and trade unchanged today at 122.70 as a lot of Brexit conversation and little action is appropriately seeing little action in fixed income futures. In the periphery, BTP 10-year futures have eased off slightly and trade with gains of around 20 ticks, with the Italian benchmark struggling to break 128.00 to the upside. 10-year BTP futures have given way in the periphery to 10-year Bono futures which are now the EZ outperformer (+42 ticks) as demand for their syndicated Govt. bond tops EUR 50bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the US, Treasury futures are extending on their initial positivity, with the 10-yr now hanging around 121.15. The majority of the action today can be found in the longer end and the curve is marginally flatter ahead of a barren slate of scheduled risk events today, with the focus remaining on trade updates (vis-a-vis Huawei) and the seemingly never-ending US Government shutdown.</p>\r\n",

In separate news, it was also reported over the weekend that US President Trump&rsquo;s Administration is said to be preparing an executive order that would restrict Chinese telecoms from operating in US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly made an offer on the shut down over the weekend that would provide &ldquo;Dreamers&rdquo; and Temporary Protection Status visa holders protection to stay in US for another 3 years in exchange for funding the Border Wall, although this was said to have been rejected by the Democrats. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May says the right way to rule out a no-deal is for the house to approve a deal, and that tge EU are unlikely to extend Article 50 unless the UK has a plan. Also stated that she will not reopen the Belfast agreement, will be holding further Brexit meetings this week and acknowledges that their approach has changed following the first vote. Doesn&rsquo;t believe there is a majority for a second referendum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese GDP (Q4) Y/Y 6.4% vs. Exp. 6.4% (Prev. 6.5%), which is the slowest growth in 28 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets were negative as the region lacked impetus following the non-existent lead from the US due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and as the slowest growth in China in nearly 3 decades continued to reverberate across risk sentiment. ASX 200 (-0.5%) was led lower by underperformance in its largest weighted financials sector and with miners dampened following softer output numbers by BHP, while Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) was also pressured with losses later exacerbated by currency flows. Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) conformed to the downbeat tone in the aftermath of the recent Chinese growth figures which some expect to further deteriorate this year and after the PBoC refrained from open market operations for a 2nd consecutive day which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 80bln, while there were also reports the US is to proceed with the formal extradition of Huawei&#39;s CFO. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned amid the uninspiring risk tone in the region and as yields also declined in the super long-end in which the 40yr yield drop to its lowest since 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 80bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7854 (Prev. 6.7774)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Foreign Ministry, when asked about a retaliation against the US if Huawei Executive Meng is extradited, said it will respond with further according taken by the US and added that what the US did is wrong. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Global Times Editor tweets, China has hoped to reach a reasonable trade deal with the US. When China&#39;s GDP grew at double digit rate, we wished China-US relations go well. But if the US forces China to sign an unequal deal, Beijing won&#39;t yield even if it is negative growth, let alone 6.6%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two US business groups have issued a report on how China is moving forward with a technology policy set to be a &quot;key point of contentions&quot; in US-Sino trade talks. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that China posted slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to US trade tensions and new policies, while he added it makes so much sense for China to do a real deal and stop playing around. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is to proceed with formal extradition of Huawei&#39;s CFO Meng. (Globe and Mail)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wall Street backlash ruins plans to transform swaps market; a Republican regulator is planning to withdraw a revamp of rules for the swaps market due to criticism from firms. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Conservative Party lawmaker Rudd warned PM May she could face dozens of ministerial resignations next week if Tory MPs are banned from voting for a plan that helps stop a no-deal Brexit. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s chief Brexit negotiator, Oliver Robbins, privately cast doubt on her ability to renegotiate the Irish backstop as part of her Brexit &quot;plan B&quot;, The Telegraph has been told. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK opposition Labour Party leader Corbyn has given in to pressure from party members and MPs by endorsing a plan to force a second EU referendum.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission are to cut Italy&#39;s growth forecast for 2019 to 0.6% (currently 1.2%) or &quot;slightly below&quot;; according to La Repubblica. (La Repubblica)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities extended losses [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.6%] after briefly pairing back opening losses as the risk sentiment continued to deteriorate. The European banking sector is underperforming, with the sector weighed on by UBS (-4.3%) following poor results; with this dragging other banking names down in sympathy such as Credit Suisse (-1.0%) and Deutsche Bank (-3.6%). Deutsche Bank also impacted by reports that they, alongside another bank, have been accused of fraud with a EUR 11bln lawsuit filed against them. Other notable movers include IG Group (-6.7%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after stating that their HY net revenue and profit are down by 6% and 18% respectively. At the other end of the Stoxx 600 are Hugo Boss (+5.0%) who reported a beat on their Q4 sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Relatively flat on the day but choppy within a 96.300-480 range following an uneventful Asia-Pac session. The buck experienced a bout of Dollar demand in earlier European trade which coincided with comments from the Chinese Foreign Ministry regarding the extradition of Huawei&rsquo;s Executive Meng wherein China strongly opposed the decision by the US and stated they will retaliate in accord with US lawmakers&rsquo; decisions. This saw the DXY push higher to intraday highs and levels just shy of 96.500 before a tweet by China&rsquo;s Global Times Editor stating that China will not yield to an unequal deal from the US sent the index lower to around the middle of today&rsquo;s range. On the States-side data front, today sees a scarce calendar with the release of existing home sales scheduled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Mixed trade as the Pound benefits from the pullback in the buck alongside optimistic jobs data in which headline average earnings beat expectations while the ILO unemployment rate ticked lower. Cable showed some strength in the run-up to the release and as the numbers provided further impetus for the Sterling, GBP/USD extended gains and breached its 100 DMA to the upside at 1.2891 to reclaim 1.2900 and print session highs of 1.2930. On the Brexit front, in yesterday&rsquo;s statement PM May said she will to head back to the EU for dialogue, while The Telegraph reported that her chief Brexit negotiator is privately doubtful on her ability to renegotiate the Irish backstop. Furthermore, she dismissed the idea of extending Article 50 with reports emerging by BBC&rsquo;s Assistant Political Editor Smith stating that Ministers will have to sit through the February recess and weekends to achieve in deal in by the Brexit date, which markets could perceive as a positive as it potentially gives them more time to achieve an appropriate deal. Meanwhile, Tory lawmaker Rudd warned that the Premier could face a dozen resignations if Tory MPs get no vote on plans to stop a no-deal Brexit, though analysts at JPM see the likelihood of a no-deal at 5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Little changed against the Dollar as the single currency fails to benefit from the receding buck as gains are capped by the Sterling-induced decline in EUR/GBP following the aforementioned UK jobs data and Brexit developments, while the release of mixed ZEW number did little to move the single currency. EUR/USD remains flat around 1.1360 while EUR/GBP resides close to session lows under 0.8800 with no notable option expiries today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; A positive day for the Yen amid overnight strength from the risk-averse tone and as the BoJ began their 2-day policy meeting (full preview available on the Research Suite). USD/JPY hovers under 109.50 (vs. low of 109.34) with the pair&rsquo;s 50 and 200 DMAs poised to form a death-cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The marked underperformers as the high-beta currencies fail to benefit from the pullback in the dollar. The Aussie bears the brunt of a global slowdown as IMF slashed global growth forecasts yesterday, while simultaneously the currency is pressured by safe-haven demand in the JPY which subsequently sent AUD/JPY below 78.00 to an intraday low of 77.88. Meanwhile the Kiwi falls in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart, albeit to a lesser extent, with NZD/USD straddling just above 0.6700 (vs. high of 0.6734).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU and UK fixed income futures kicked of the day on the front foot and 10-year Bund and Gilt futures hit session peaks of 164.52 and 122.96 respectively but have pared gains in recent trade to essentially trade flat for the day. Technical factors, as opposed to fundamental, likely drove the reversion with Bunds failing to convincingly break the 164.50 level and Gilts also unable to break through the 123.00 handle to the upside. Bunds were also offered marginal support by a ZEW survey which was soft, but not as bad as some had feared. Gilt traders will now be looking out for further direction from events in Westminster, BoE&rsquo;s Carney who has now arrived at the Davos forum. In the periphery, BTP 10-year futures marginally underperform their German counterparts and trade with gains of just a shade under 10 ticks despite the EU commission set to cut their Italian growth forecast for 2019 to 0.6% from 1.2%, as according to La Repubblica, the second institution in a week to cut their forecast after the Italian Central Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the USTs are playing catch up after yesterday&rsquo;s MLK day break in cash markets. Futures are higher across the curve with the majority of the action in the longer end. Focus has returned to Huawei as the Globe and Mail reported the US is to go ahead with the formal extradition of CFO Meng, with traders&rsquo; eyes&rsquo; now set on further responses by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.9%) and WTI (-1.8%) extended losses as the complex is impacted by the negative risk tone and US absence from market yesterday. The energy complex saw another leg lower after Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih has reportedly cancelled his trip to Davos; Al Falih was due to speak on Wednesday on the New Energy Equation but more importantly, the Energy Minister was due to hold talks on the recent OPEC+ production cuts with the Russian Eenergy Minister. Elsewhere, the Canadian province of Alberta is expected to announce a CAD 2bln oil sector investment plan. Separately, as yesterday was a US holiday API weekly data will be released tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is in the green, trading towards the top end of the sessions range as markets continue to be impacted by the negative risk tone and a receding dollar. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s top steel-making city of Tangshan has issued a level 2 smog alert; to be effective until January 25th. BHP, the world&rsquo;s biggest miner, reported a 9% fall in iron ore production, as well as highlighting USD 600mln impact due to iron and copper operations disruptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian province Alberta is expected to announce CAD 2bln oil sector investment plan, in which Alberta Premier Notley is reportedly to announce a CAD 2bln facility to squeeze more oil into clogged pipelines.

The European banking sector is underperforming, with the sector weighed on by UBS (-4.1%) following poor results; with this dragging other banking names down in sympathy such as Credit Suisse (-1.1%) and Deutsche Bank (-3.6%). Deutsche Bank also impacted by reports that they, alongside another bank, have been accused of fraud with a EUR 11bln lawsuit filed against them. Other notable movers include IG Group (-6.2%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after stating that their HY net revenue and profit are down by 6% and 18% respectively. At the other end of the Stoxx 600 are Hugo Boss (+5.0%) who reported a beat on their Q4 sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Relatively flat on the day but choppy within a 96.300-480 range following an uneventful Asia-Pac session. The buck experienced a bout of Dollar demand in earlier European trade which coincided with comments from the Chinese Foreign Ministry regarding the extradition of Huawei&rsquo;s Executive Meng wherein China strongly opposed the decision by the US and stated they will retaliate in accord with US lawmakers&rsquo; decisions. This saw the DXY push higher to intraday highs and levels just shy of 96.500 before a tweet by China&rsquo;s Global Times Editor stating that China will not yield to an unequal deal from the US sent the index lower to around the middle of today&rsquo;s range. On the States-side data front, today sees a scarce calendar with the release of existing home sales scheduled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Mixed trade as the Pound benefits from the pullback in the buck alongside optimistic jobs data in which headline average earnings beat expectations while the ILO unemployment rate ticked lower. Cable showed some strength in the run-up to the release and as the numbers provided further impetus for the Sterling, GBP/USD extended gains and breached its 100 DMA to the upside at 1.2891 to reclaim 1.2900 and print session highs of 1.2930. On the Brexit front, in yesterday&rsquo;s statement PM May said she will to head back to the EU for dialogue, while The Telegraph reported that her chief Brexit negotiator is privately doubtful on her ability to renegotiate the Irish backstop. Furthermore, she dismissed the idea of extending Article 50 with reports emerging by BBC&rsquo;s Assistant Political Editor Smith stating that Ministers will have to sit through the February recess and weekends to achieve in deal in by the Brexit date, which markets could perceive as a positive as it potentially gives them more time to achieve an appropriate deal. Meanwhile, Tory lawmaker Rudd warned that the Premier could face a dozen resignations if Tory MPs get no vote on plans to stop a no-deal Brexit, though analysts at JPM see the likelihood of a no-deal at 5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Little changed against the Dollar as the single currency fails to benefit from the receding buck as gains are capped by the Sterling-induced decline in EUR/GBP following the aforementioned UK jobs data and Brexit developments, while the release of mixed ZEW number did little to move the single currency. EUR/USD remains flat around 1.1360 while EUR/GBP resides close to session lows under 0.8800 with no notable option expiries today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; A positive day for the Yen amid overnight strength from the risk-averse tone and as the BoJ began their 2-day policy meeting (full preview available on the Research Suite). USD/JPY hovers just under 109.50 (vs. low of 109.34) with the pair&rsquo;s 50 and 200 DMAs poised to form a death-cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The marked underperformers as the high-beta currencies fail to benefit from the pullback in the dollar. The Aussie bears the brunt of a global slowdown as IMF slashed global growth forecasts yesterday, while simultaneously the currency is pressured by safe-haven demand in the JPY which subsequently sent AUD/JPY below 78.00 to an intraday low of 77.88. Meanwhile the Kiwi falls in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart, albeit to a lesser extent, with NZD/USD straddling just above 0.6700 (vs. high of 0.6734).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU and UK fixed income futures kicked of the day on the front foot and 10-year Bund and Gilt futures hit session peaks of 164.52 and 122.96 respectively but have pared gains in recent trade to essentially trade flat for the day. Technical factors, as opposed to fundamental, likely drove the reversion with Bunds failing to convincingly break the 164.50 level and Gilts also unable to break through the 123.00 handle to the upside. Bunds were also offered marginal support by a ZEW survey which was soft, but not as bad as some had feared. Gilt traders will now be looking out for further direction from events in Westminster, BoE&rsquo;s Carney who has now arrived at the Davos forum. In the periphery, BTP 10-year futures marginally underperform their German counterparts and trade with gains of just a shade under 10 ticks despite the EU commission set to cut their Italian growth forecast for 2019 to 0.6% from 1.2%, as according to La Repubblica, the second institution in a week to cut their forecast after the Italian Central Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the USTs are playing catch up after yesterday&rsquo;s MLK day break in cash markets. Futures are higher across the curve with the majority of the action in the longer end. Focus has returned to Huawei as the Globe and Mail reported the US is to go ahead with the formal extradition of CFO Meng, with traders&rsquo; eyes&rsquo; now set on further responses by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.5%) and WTI (-1.5%) extended losses as the complex is impacted by the negative risk tone and US absence from market yesterday. Recently, we have seen reports that Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih has cancelled his trip to Davos; Al Falih was due to speak on Wednesday on the New Energy Equation. Elsewhere, the Canadian province of Alberta is expected to announce a CAD 2bln oil sector investment plan. Separately, as yesterday was a US holiday API weekly data will be released tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is in the green, trading towards the top end of the sessions range as markets continue to be impacted by the negative risk tone and a receding dollar. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s top steel-making city of Tangshan has issued a level 2 smog alert; to be effective until January 25th. BHP, the world&rsquo;s biggest miner, reported a 9% fall in iron ore production, as well as highlighting USD 600mln impact due to iron and copper operations disruptions.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Core EU and UK fixed income futures kicked of the day on the front foot and 10-year Bund and Gilt futures hit session peaks of 164.52 and 122.96 respectively, but have pared gains in recent trade to essentially trade flat for the day. Technical factors, as opposed to fundamental, likely drove the reversion with Bunds failing to convincingly break the 164.50 level and Gilts also unable to break through the 123.00 handle to the upside. Bunds were also offered marginal support by a ZEW survey which was soft, but not as bad as some had feared. Gilt traders will now be looking out for further direction from events in Westminster, BoE&rsquo;s Carney who has now arrived at the Davos forum, and supply also on the docket in the form of the GBP 1.75bln 2037 Gilt auction. In the periphery, BTP 10-year futures are the outperformer, with the Italian benchmark trading at highs of the day and trying to find a firm footing above the 128.00 handle. This comes despite the EU commission set to cut their Italian growth forecast for 2019 to 0.6% from 1.2%, as according to La Repubblica, the second institution in a week to cut their forecast after the Italian Central Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, treasuries are playing catch up after yesterday&rsquo;s MLK day break in cash markets. Futures are higher across the curve with the majority of the action in the longer end. Focus has returned to Huawei as the Globe and Mail reported the US is to go ahead with the formal extradition of CFO Meng, with traders eyes&rsquo; now set on further responses by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p>\r\n",

(Sky)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was relatively rangebound amid the holiday-thinned conditions although has marginally benefitted as price moves across its major counterparts were largely dictated by the risk averse tone. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD were mildly pressured overnight, although the latter remained in proximity for a retest of the 1.2900 level following the prior day&rsquo;s swings as UK PM May presented her so-called &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; which commentators suggested seemed suspiciously like Plan A, while PM May also stressed the only way to rule out a no deal is to find an agreement. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially consolidated as the BoJ began its 2-day policy meeting but was later pressured amid a deterioration in risk sentiment, while antipodeans were subdued due to their high-beta characteristics, softness across the commodities complex and after the PBoC weakened the reference rate.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were subdued overnight due to the risk averse tone in which oil prices declined by over 1% with WTI crude futures pulling back from resistance at the 54.00/bbl level and with Brent crude testing 62.00/bbl to the downside. Elsewhere, gold was range-bound as it reflected similar price action in the greenback following the absence of US participants, while copper underperformed as sentiment gradually deteriorated throughout the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian province Alberta is expected to announce CAD 2bln oil sector investment plan, in which Alberta Premier Notley is reportedly to announce a CAD 2bln facility to squeeze more oil into clogged pipelines.

Hang Seng (-1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) conformed to the downbeat tone in the aftermath of the recent Chinese growth figures which some expect to further deteriorate this year and after the PBoC refrained from open market operations for a 2nd consecutive day which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 80bln, while there were also reports the US is to proceed with the formal extradition of Huawei&#39;s CFO.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly negative with the region lacking impetus following the non-existent lead from US due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and as the slowest growth in China in nearly 3 decades continues to reverberate across risk sentiment. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is led lower by underperformance in its largest weighted financials sector and with miners dampened following softer output numbers by BHP, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) is also subdued but with downside limited as JPY consolidates ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BoJ policy meeting conclusion. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) conform to the downbeat tone in the aftermath of the recent Chinese growth figures which some expect to further deteriorate this year, while the PBoC refrained from open market operations for a 2nd consecutive day which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 80bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets struggle for direction with the DXY unchanged amid the holiday-thinned conditions and with its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD rangebound at the 1.1300 and 1.2800 handles respectively. Nonetheless, GBP/USD remains in proximity for a retest of the 1.2900 level following the prior day&rsquo;s mild support as UK PM May presented her so-called &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; which commentators suggested seemed suspiciously like Plan A, while PM May also stressed the only way to rule out a no deal is to find an agreement. Elsewhere, JPY consolidates as the BoJ kick-starts its 2-day meeting, while antipodeans are subdued due to their high-beta characteristics, softness across the commodities complex and after the PBoC weakened the reference rate, although downside in AUD/USD is kept minimal by support at 0.7150.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices mildly underpinned amid the uninspiring risk tone in the region, while yields also declined in the super long-end in which the 40yr yield drop to its lowest since 2016.</p>\r\n",
