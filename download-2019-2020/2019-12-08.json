Goldman Sachs (GS) caught a bid after reports its 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) fine is likely to be under USD 2bln, a sum lower than what some analysts suggested the bank would have to pay for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling USD 6.5bln that the bank helped raise for the sovereign wealth fund (1MDB). Tesla (TSLA) up just shy of 2% after China made Tesla cars qualify for subsidies where buyers will get as much as USD 3550 from the government. Uber (UBER) traded in the red after it released its statistics which saw 3000 sexual assault claims last year and in total it saw 107 total fatalities. Its sexual assault statistics showed one in 2mln trips saw non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part, where 1 in 3mln saw non-consensual kissing of a sexual body part.

Additionally, prelim consumer confidence data from the UoM was firmer than expected. Next week, the Fed is expected to stand pat on rates, and according to market pricing, as derived from the CME's Fedwatch tool, there is a 100% chance of an unchanged decision (which was priced with 99.3% certainty on Thursday). Ahead of the US day, constructive news on the trade front (China plans to implement tariff waivers for some purchases of US ags, and will begin applications for importing soybeans and pork from the US) resulted in some downside for Treasuries. There was also reports of short-covering after remarks from NEC director Kudlow (tariffs are up to the President), while other reports suggested short-covering came ahead of next week's FOMC and ECB confabs. Major curve spreads, however, are little changed, though 2s5s and 2s10s are up by around 1bps at settlement, and 2s30s 5s10s 5s30s and 10s30s a touch narrower).
