The US also sold USD 41bln of 5-year notes at the lowest yield since January 2018, stopping through by 0.6bps with a bid-to-cover of 2.41x. Overall a robust auction; primary dealers took the smallest share since last July, direct bidders took the largest share since July 2014, indirect bidders took the largest share since last August.

Also, US President Trump reiterated positive comments on the benefits of his tariff measures in the steel industry. In related comments, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expects to make significant progress at trade talks with the Chinese delegation this week. As a reminder, US Commerce Secretary Ross, Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen and US Acting AG Whitaker to make a China-related enforcement announcement at 2130GMT/1630ET.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The House of Commons will be voting on PM May&rsquo;s Brexit plan B including a number of amendments that will be selected by the speaker. There were rumours on Monday that the labour party only has a &ldquo;handful of their MPs&rdquo; voting against the Cooper-Bales and Brady amendments, which appear the two most significant ones paving the way for a softer Brexit. The former states that the Brexit date should be delayed by nine months if a deal is not reached in Parliament by the end of February while the latter requires the backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements, effectively giving more time to reach a compromise with the EU. Nonetheless voices later suggested that Labour will not be setting its position on the Cooper amendment until it is selected tomorrow. Later in the afternoon, UK PM May met with conservative lawmakers where she reportedly gained the party&rsquo;s support to vote in favour of the Brady amendment, seeking to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements. At the meeting, PM May promised a new Meaningful Vote with a motion likely to be laid on Feb 13th, followed by two days of debate, and the vote to take place on the evening of Feb 14th. On the EU&rsquo;s side, Deputy Negotiator Weyand said that they have margin to change the political declaration while reiterating that a time limit to a backstop defeats its purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Draghi (Dovish) reiterated similar language stating that significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential, balance of risks to growth have tilted to the downside and noted that uncertainties remain, especially related to geopolitical developments. He added that if things go &quot;very wrong&quot; then the ECB can resume other instruments in the toolbox, but does not see such contingency to materialise this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.70 LOWER AT USD 51.99/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.71 LOWER AT USD 59.93/BBL.</strong> Oil was trading off weak risk sentiment, as well as news that Libyan ports were now re-opened following bad weather, seeing crude trade in the red on Monday, with March-dated Brent falling beneath the key $60/bbl, while its WTI counterpart traded sub-$52. &quot;The US government may be reopening, but the markets are not staging any kind of relief rally, as the government could shut again as soon as 15 February without further agreement,&quot; Citi said. &quot;The status of government data releases, including next week&rsquo;s 4Q GDP report and the CFTC Commitments of Traders data remains uncertain and so we continue to operate with less than the usual array of trade flow data.&quot; Citi says that the buying in the Brent over the past few weeks has been a function of short-covering, &quot;and so it doesn&rsquo;t look as though money managers have been particularly impressed by the support from OPEC+ production cuts, at least so far.&quot; Additionally, traders were citing last week&#39;s Baker Hughes rig count data, which showed rigs rose by 10 in the week, though Citi expresses some scepticism of this view: &quot;If anything, we think this talk underscores the extent to which there&rsquo;s really not fresh bearish fundamental news here, although we recognize that a technical break of $60 support in Brent crude oil could trigger further selling.&quot; Elsewhere, the Saudi Arabian energy minister was on the wires on Monday, and said that Saudi output would fall to 10.1mln BPD in February, overshooting its commitment to cut supply to 10.31mln BPD (as part of last Winter&#39;s OPEC+ deal). The US is said to be preparing sanctions for Venezuela&rsquo;s state oil producer PDVSA, later confirmed by US National Security Advisor confirmed who added that USD 7bln in assets will be blocked today. Nonetheless, Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin stated that US refineries can continue to operate using Venezuelan oil and US gas prices should not be impacted, at least in the short-term. In later trade, it was reported that the US government considering the release of oil from US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to coincide with possible sanctions imposed on Venezuela&#39;s exports. This week&rsquo;s crude inventories see oil building by 3.4mln, distillates drawing by 2.2mln and gasoline building by 2.0mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.79% at 2643, NASDAQ -1.33% at 6697, DJI -0.84% at 24528. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -1.20%, Materials -0.22%, Industrials -1.02%, Cons Discretionary +0.32%, Cons Staples -0.78%, Healthcare -1.30%, Financials -0.13%, Tech -1.56%, Telecoms -1.13%, Utilities -0.61%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Industrial bellwether Caterpillar (CAT) reported a significant miss on its EPS estimate and cited poor demand in China, dragging down indices today. NVIDIA (NVDA) added to losses after lowering its Q4 revenue guidance. The crude price sensitive energy sector (HAL, COP, CVX) underperformed after oil prices tumbled, as of such, Airlines (AAL, ALK, JBLU) were outperformers. AbbVie (ABBV) opened higher after receiving FDA approval for a leukaemia treating drug. Dell Technologies (DELL) outperformed following bullish comments in Barron&rsquo;s magazine. Versum Materials (VSM) and Entegris (ENTG) surged following their announcement of a merger of equals. Vale (VALE) nosedived in the fallout from its dam bursting in Brazil. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) opened in the red with thanks to a downgrade at Goldman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED TICKS 3 HIGHER AT 121-16.</strong> Treasuries started the week marginally higher as stocks were sliding amid disappointing earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and cut in Q4 guidance for Nvidia (NVDA). Yields were lower by c.1bps across the curve at settlement; the complex recovered some losses after the auctions albeit remaining in negative territory. The curve, which saw some modest flattening earlier in the day, steepened after the auctions on some long-end selling. The US sold USD 40bln in 2-year notes on Monday at the lowest yield since June 2018, stopping through by 0.6bps with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.56x; primary dealers took the smallest share since January 2018 and indirect bidders took the largest since then. The US also sold USD 41bln of 5-year notes at the lowest yield since January 2018, stopping through by 0.6bps with a bid-to-cover of 2.41x. Overall a robust auction; primary dealers took the smallest share since last July, direct bidders took the largest share since July 2014, indirect bidders took the largest share since last August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Holding up relatively well within a 95.671-920 range, but prone to plenty of stumbling blocks given this week&rsquo;s Fed, Washington-Beijing trade negotiations and monthly US jobs data, not to mention the potential for the back-log of economic reports to be releases now that Government has re-opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR, CHF: </strong>Not the biggest G10 movers, but certainly the major beneficiaries of safe-haven demand as broad risk sentiment was undermined by earnings and uncertainty ahead of the latest Brexit vote (on Plan B tomorrow), FOMC decision (Wednesday), US-China trade talks (Wednesday-Thursday) and NFP (Friday). Usd/Jpy has gradually drifted back further from circa 109.69 towards 109.20 and real money bids said to be waiting at 109.00, while Eur/Usd has not been unduly hampered by ECB President Draghi&rsquo;s testimony to EU Parliament underscoring last Thursday&rsquo;s more downbeat/dovish post-policy meeting press conference. In fact, the single currency has actually carved out further gains above 1.1400 vs the Dollar just shy of 1.1440, as the Franc breaks though 0.9900 to the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, GBP, AUD: </strong>Extended downside in crude prices has combined with the aforementioned risk aversion to leave the Loonie languishing and losing more ground vs its US counterpart at 1.3285 before paring back, while the Pound hit lows just below 1.3140 and 0.8690 vs the Eur amidst Brexit jitters before tomorrow&rsquo;s Parliament vote, with UK MPs jostling around all the amendments and the EU holding a firm line on the key Irish back-stop clauses. Elsewhere, the Aussie underperformed down under after getting an initial boost overnight in wake of a lower Usd/Cny midpoint fix, as sentiment soured again and some regional traders seemed to favour the Kiwi via the cross (sub-1.0500) while Australian&rsquo;s enjoyed an extended 3-day holiday weekend.</p>\r\n",

This week&rsquo;s crude inventories see oil building by 3.4mln, distillates drawing by 2.2mln and gasoline building by 2.0mln.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Jpy has gradually drifted back further from circa 109.69 towards 109.20 and real money bids said to be waiting at 109.00, while Eur/Usd has not been unduly hampered by ECB President Draghi&rsquo;s testimony to EU Parliament underscoring last Thursday&rsquo;s more downbeat/dovish post-policy meeting press conference. In fact, the single currency has actually carved out further gains above 1.1400 vs the Dollar just shy of 1.1440, as the Franc inches closer to 0.9900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/AUD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended downside in crude prices has combined with the aforementioned risk aversion to leave the Loonie languishing and losing more ground vs its US counterpart at 1.3285 before paring back, while the Pound hit lows just below 1.3140 and 0.8690 vs the Eur amidst Brexit jitters before tomorrow&rsquo;s Parliament vote, with UK MPs jostling around all the amendments and the EU holding a firm line on the key Irish back-stop clauses. Elsewhere, the Aussie underperformed down under after getting an initial boost overnight in wake of a lower Usd/Cny midpoint fix, as sentiment soured again and some regional traders seemed to favour the Kiwi via the cross (sub-1.0500) while Australian&rsquo;s enjoyed an extended 3 day holiday weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up relatively well within a 95.671-920 range, but prone to plenty of stumbling blocks given this week&rsquo;s Fed, Washington-Beijing trade negotiations and monthly US jobs data, not to mention the potential for the back-log of economic reports to be releases now that Government has re-opened.</p>\r\n",

This lifted sentiment across the Asia-Pac bourses in early trade with ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) the exceptions as Australia remained closed for holiday and Japanese stocks were hampered by recent currency flows, with Japan Display among the worst hit after it flagged a severe situation regarding its FY net. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (U/C) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) positive for most the session as corporate updates also provided a catalyst in which Sinopec were underpinned by an increase in preliminary FY net and revenue. However, the region later failed to hold on to early gains amid several factors including PBoC liquidity inaction, a consecutive monthly decline in Chinese Industrial Profits and looming risk events including US-China trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively uneventful with only brief support despite the underperformance of Tokyo stocks and BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1tln of JGBs, while the BoJ minutes from the December meeting also failed to garner a reaction as it provided no surprises and considering there was also a more recent meeting held last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7472 (Prev. 6.7941)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Industrial Profits (Dec) Y/Y -1.9% (Prev. -1.8%).

(Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he sees less than a 50% chance of reaching a deal by Feb 15th and he is open to declaring a national emergency if lawmakers fail to provide funding for border wall and was said to have told advisers that declaring a national emergency may now be his best option. Trump added that another shutdown is certainly an option and dismissed suggestions he would accept less than USD 5.7bln for the border wall.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly told cabinet ministers privately she will not allow Britain to exit without a deal, although is said to not be ready to rule out a no-deal publicly as it would impact negotiations with Brussels. (The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remain ministers stated during a secret conference call that UK PM May must commit to securing her Brussel deal within 2 weeks to avoid resignations regarding a no-deal Brexit.

Sectors are similarly in the red, energy names are underperforming (amid the price action in the complex) with some outperformance seen in telecom names; with the likes of Dixons Carphone (+3.1%) in the green after being upgraded at Morgan Stanley. Other notable movers include, Telecom Italia (+1.4%) who were initially at bottom of the Stoxx 600, though the company pared losses amid reports suggesting that Enel&rsquo;s (-0.3%) open fibre unit are said to be seeking a pact with the Co. Elsewhere, London-listed Ocado (+2.7%) are towards the top of the Stoxx 600 following reports that the Co. have held talks with Marks and Spencer (+0.4%) concerning the launch of a food delivery service. Finally, miners are initially outperformed (Rio Tinto +1.6%) amid hopes of rising iron ore prices following the dam collapse at the Vale mine in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The main G10 underperformer ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s Brexit vote, as Cable recoils from 1.3200+ overnight peaks and Eur/Gbp bounces off circa 0.8637 lows to trade around 1.3150 and 0.8670 respectively. Consolidation, profit-taking and/or position paring has stemmed the latest advance in Sterling, along with a broader stabilisation in the Dollar and relative resilience in the single currency (holding above 1.1400 vs the Usd) following firmer than forecast Eurozone M3 data. Note, decent Eur/Usd option expiry interest between 1.1400-15 as 1.4 bn rolls off at the NY cut. Back to the Pound, some chance of additional impetus via BoE members today including Governor Carney, Broadbent and Ramsden, but in truth tomorrow&rsquo;s Plan B Parliament judgement will likely be the next major driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi tops the major league, albeit helped by external factors, like a firmer Yuan and Aud cross flows, as Australia&rsquo;s national day celebrations spilled over to Monday. Nzd/Usd is pivoting 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd has dipped below 1.0500, while Aud/Usd hovers just under 0.7200. Back to the Kiwi, NZ trade data looms and could be key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - As noted, the Buck appears to have gleaned some traction in the run up to the FOMC, US-China trade talks and NFP, with perhaps a degree of support coming via the deal to re-open Government. However, the index still looks vulnerable sub-96.00 within a 95.920-671 range, and as the Greenback remains softer vs the Jpy and Chf circa 109.50 and 0.9915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Soft oil prices undermining the Loonie to an extent, as Usd/Cad nestles near the top of 1.3200-30 parameters</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After churning and trading sideways in the absence of any fresh catalysts, drivers or major breaking headlines, core debt is sagging again with Bunds easing a bit further below 165.00 to 164.88, so far (-19 ticks on the day). Techs may now be eyeing 164.82 ahead of 164.59-56 and then deeper trendline chart support at 164.33 given the downside break through last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex low, while Gilts bears will also be looking at a trend low (122.52) if the opening 122.61 Liffe print is pierced. Perhaps a partial recovery in EU stocks is weighing, while US Treasuries have edged lower ahead of hefty supply and the prospect of more regular data updates in the run up to the Fed as Government workers return to their desks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.6%) and WTI (-1.7%) are both firmly in the red, weighed on by risk sentiment, ahead of this week&rsquo;s key events including US-China trade talks in Washington. Furthermore, Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count showed the number of active oil rigs increased by 10 (first increase this year); adding additional downward pressure to the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.2%) is marginally in negative territory, weighed on by dollar strength despite of the negative risk sentiment, as the yellow metal detaches itself from its safe-haven status (again). Elsewhere, the US has removed sanctions on Rusal and two other firms connected with Russian billionaire Deripaska; with the move returning some certainty to the aluminium markets supply. Separately, iron ore prices have moved higher as markets react to news of a dam collapse at the Corrego do Feijao iron ore mine in Brazil; for reference the mine has an approximate capacity of 7.8mln tonnes.</p>\r\n",

Sectors are similarly in the red, energy names are underperforming (amid the price action in the complex) with some outperformance seen in telecom names; with the likes of Dixons Carphone (+4.0%) in the green after being upgraded at Morgan Stanley. Other notable movers include, Telecom Italia (+1.0%) who were initially at bottom of the Stoxx 600, though the company pared losses amid reports suggesting that Enel&rsquo;s (-0.2%) open fibre unit are said to be seeking a pact with the Co. Elsewhere, London-listed Ocado (+3.5%) are towards the top of the Stoxx 600 following reports that the Co. have held talks with Marks and Spencer (+1.2%) concerning the launch of a food delivery service. Finally, miners are initially outperformed (Rio Tinto +2.0%, Glencore +0.3%) amid hopes of rising iron ore prices following the dam collapse at the Vale mine in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The main G10 underperformer ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s Brexit vote, as Cable recoils from 1.3200+ overnight peaks and Eur/Gbp bounces off circa 0.8637 lows to trade around 1.3150 and 0.8670 respectively. Consolidation, profit-taking and/or position paring has stemmed the latest advance in Sterling, along with a broader stabilisation in the Dollar and relative resilience in the single currency (holding above 1.1400 vs the Usd) following firmer than forecast Eurozone M3 data. Note, decent Eur/Usd option expiry interest between 1.1400-15 as 1.4 bn rolls off at the NY cut. Back to the Pound, some chance of additional impetus via BoE members today including Governor Carney, Broadbent and Ramsden, but in truth tomorrow&rsquo;s Plan B Parliament judgement will likely be the next major driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi tops the major league, albeit helped by external factors, like a firmer Yuan and Aud cross flows, as Australia&rsquo;s national day celebrations spilled over to Monday. Nzd/Usd is pivoting 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd has dipped below 1.0500, while Aud/Usd hovers just under 0.7200. Back to the Kiwi, NZ trade data looms and could be key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - As noted, the Buck appears to have gleaned some traction in the run up to the FOMC, US-China trade talks and NFP, with perhaps a degree of support coming via the deal to re-open Government. However, the index still looks vulnerable sub-96.00 within a 95.920-671 range, and as the Greenback remains softer vs the Jpy and Chf circa 109.50 and 0.9915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Soft oil prices undermining the Loonie to an extent, as Usd/Cad nestles near the top of 1.3200-30 parameters</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After churning and trading sideways in the absence of any fresh catalysts, drivers or major breaking headlines, core debt is sagging again with Bunds easing a bit further below 165.00 to 164.88, so far (-19 ticks on the day). Techs may now be eyeing 164.82 ahead of 164.59-56 and then deeper trendline chart support at 164.33 given the downside break through last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex low, while Gilts bears will also be looking at a trend low (122.52) if the opening 122.61 Liffe print is pierced. Perhaps a partial recovery in EU stocks is weighing, while US Treasuries have edged lower ahead of hefty supply and the prospect of more regular data updates in the run up to the Fed as Government workers return to their desks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.5%) and WTI (-1.7%) are both firmly in the red, weighed on by risk sentiment, ahead of this week&rsquo;s key events including US-China trade talks in Washington. Furthermore, Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count showed the number of active oil rigs increased by 10 (first increase this year); adding additional downward pressure to the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.2%) is marginally in negative territory, weighed on by dollar strength despite of the negative risk sentiment, as the yellow metal detaches itself from its safe-haven status (again). Elsewhere, the US has removed sanctions on Rusal and two other firms connected with Russian billionaire Deripaska; with the move returning some certainty to the aluminium markets supply. Separately, iron ore prices have moved higher as markets react to news of a dam collapse at the Corrego do Feijao iron ore mine in Brazil; for reference the mine has an approximate capacity of 7.8mln tonnes.</p>\r\n",

Back to the Kiwi, NZ trade data looms and could be key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, the Buck appears to have gleaned some traction in the run up to the FOMC, US-China trade talks and NFP, with perhaps a degree of support coming via the deal to re-open Government. However, the index still looks vulnerable sub-96.00 within a 95.920-671 range, and as the Greenback remains softer vs the Jpy and Chf circa 109.50 and 0.9915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soft oil prices undermining the Loonie to an extent, as Usd/Cad nestles near the top of 1.3200-30 parameters.</p>\r\n",

Bunds and Eurozone bonds in general continue to encounter resistance on approaches towards last week&rsquo;s post-ECB peaks ahead of a potentially busy/explosive few days with the latest Brexit vote, FOMC and US-China trade talks all scheduled before NFP on Friday and perhaps a deluge of other US data releases given the temporary deal forged to end the partial US Government shutdown. More immediately, M3 data for December, ECB&rsquo;s Draghi at EU Parliament, plus Nowotny perhaps.</p>\r\n",

(Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ December meeting minutes stated that members said it is appropriate to continue easing persistently and that CPI was likely to gradually increases towards target. The BoJ also stated that financial conditions are highly accommodative, while one member suggested that long-term yields should be allowed to temporarily turn to negative.

This kept its major counterparts afloat with EUR/USD above 1.1400, while GBP/USD rose to its strongest in more than 3-months and briefly reclaimed the 1.3200 handle. The latest reports suggested UK PM May privately ruled out a no-deal to cabinet ministers but was not prepared to declare this publicly as it would impact negotiations, while PM May is reportedly planning on renegotiating the backstop with Brussels although Ireland refused to budge and said it will not accept changes to the agreement aimed at avoiding a hard border.

Rumours of a potential end to the government shutdown pushed treasuries to new lows; the complex remained around these levels after US President Trump confirmed a tentative deal has been reached with lawmakers to end the government shutdown until February 15th. Most of the actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were narrowly mixed. US T-note futures (H9) settled 11 ticks lower at 121-13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US ended the government shutdown after a tentative agreement was reached on a stopgap bill to fund the government till February 15th while negotiations continue on funding for a border wall. Furthermore, President Trump said he will declare an emergency if he doesn&#39;t reach a deal, while an administration official said the final deal to keep government open must have wall funding but does not have to amount to USD 5.7bln to get the White House&rsquo;s approval. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he sees less than a 50% chance of reaching a deal by Feb 15th and he is open to declaring a national emergency if lawmakers fail to provide funding for border wall and was said to have told advisers that declaring a national emergency may now be his best option. Trump added that another shutdown is certainly an option and dismissed suggestions he would accept less than USD 5.7bln for the border wall. (WSJ/Washington Post)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly higher as momentum rolls over from the positive performance stateside on Friday where all majors gained and the US agreed to end the record-long government shutdown. This lifted sentiment in nearly all the Asia-Pac bourses with ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) the exceptions as Australia is closed for holiday, while Japanese stocks are hampered by recent currency flows with Japan Display among the worst hit after it flagged a severe situation regarding its FY net. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) are positive heading into this week&rsquo;s US-China trade discussions and as earnings guidance also provides a catalyst with Sinopec underpinned by an increase in preliminary FY net and revenue. However, looming key risk events, lack of liquidity operations by the PBoC and a consecutive monthly decline in Chinese Industrial Profits has capped upside in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued following the recent slip to below the 96.00 level and reports which suggested Fed officials were nearing a decision on ending the balance sheet wind-down sooner than expected. This has kept its major counterparts afloat with EUR/USD above 1.1400, while GBP/USD rose to its strongest in more than 3-months and briefly reclaimed the 1.3200 handle, before it returned flat amid Brexit uncertainty. The latest reports suggested UK PM May told cabinet ministers privately she will not let Britain leave without an agreement but is not ready to rule out a no-deal publicly as it would impact negotiations, while PM May is said to plan renegotiating the backstop with Brussels although Ireland refused to budge and said it will not accept changes to the agreement aimed at avoiding a hard border. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies marginally benefit from the mostly positive risk tone, USD/JPY is dragged lower and PBoC also set the firmest CNY fix since July 19th in the wake of the subdued greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively uneventful with only mild support seen amid the underperformance of Tokyo stocks and BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1tln of JGBs, while the BoJ minutes from the December meeting also failed to garner a reaction as it provided no surprises and considering there was also a more recent meeting held last week.</p>\r\n",
