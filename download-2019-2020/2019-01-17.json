Nonetheless,&nbsp; a US Treasury official announced that no statement is expected on China and neither Mnuchin nor Lightizer have made any recommendations to anyone about tariffs. &nbsp;In an immediate reaction, stocks bounced to fresh intraday highs before paring back some of those gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May has begun cross-party talks in an attempt to break the Brexit impasse after her Brexit deal was rejected by the Commons earlier in the week and after the government survived yesterday&rsquo;s confidence vote. On Thursday, she held meetings with MPs to gather views across Parliament. Labour party leader has yet to take part in discussions, as he declared there will be no talks with PM May until a no-deal Brexit is off the table. On the EU side, EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier stated that if Britain wants a deal that goes further than free trade, &quot;we are open.&quot; Elsewhere, Downing St has said the government has produced &lsquo;a very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required&rsquo; to hold another referendum, suggesting it would take a year to organise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Quarles (Neutral, Voter) believes real US economy data is very strong, jobs creation in December was &quot;very strong&quot; and inflation appears very well contained. Separately, US President Trump mulls whether to re-nominate Marvin Goodfriend to the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Sources reported that an envoy from North Korea could meet with US Secretary of State Pompeo on Friday in Washington, which could lead to a second summit between North Korean leader Kim and US President Trump. A meeting with Trump was also said to be possible. In related comments, acting US Defence Secretary Shanahan North Korea&#39;s missiles remain a significant concern a do Iran&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SARB:</strong> The central bank kept rates unchanged at 6.75%, as expected, in a unanimous decision. The tone tilted to the dovish side with the statement outlining that the domestic growth outlook remains subdued and that the output gap will not close until early 2021. The bank also emphasized that inflation risks remain marginally to the upside, but not much has improved. A more accommodative stance was also reflected in the revised growth forecasts as the SARB now sees 2019 GDP at 1.7% from 1.9%. Inflation forecasts for 2019 and 2020 were also cut to 4.8% from 5.5% and to 5.3% from 5.4%, respectively. Nonetheless, Informa argues that &ldquo;those looking for the SARB to stimulate the economy (perhaps the ANC party?) will be disappointed as Governor Kganyago stated the problems facing the economy are structural&rdquo; suggesting it is up to the government to fix those issues. Looking ahead, another hike now appears off the table since the SARB&rsquo;s own model now predicts only one more rate hike by the end of 2021 (Prev. 75bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PHILLY FED: </strong>The index bounced to 17 in January rebounding from the 2-year low of 9.4 seen in December. This comes as a big surprise given that the ISM Mfg and the Empire State index posted significant drops earlier in the week. Analysts at Pantheon suggest that the measures usually follow a similar trend, but the Philly Fed now appears to be an outlier. They however expect the figure to come under pressure amid a slowdown in China and as the trade war with the region drags on. &ldquo;In short, the headline is not a representative signal of the state of manufacturing, either now or over the next few months. &ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.24 LOWER AT USD 52.07/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.14 LOWER AT USD 61.18/BBL. </strong>Oil extended losses amid growing fear of an economic slowdown, with particular focus on China&rsquo;s as well as the prolonged US government shutdown. Adding downward pressure to the complex, the monthly OPEC report showed crude production falling 751k BPD in December, less than the expected ~800ml, to average 31.58mln BPD; cuts were led by Saudi Arabia and Libya &ldquo;underscoring the idea that a further reduction into 2019 &ndash; already mandated by the OPEC+ production cuts &ndash; is still necessary&rdquo; Citi suggests. Global demand forecast for 2019 was left unchanged while non-OPEC supply was revised higher by only 50k bpd compared with last month&rsquo;s projections. Crude OPEC compliance rose 163% in December. In news flow, sources indicated that OPEC is planning an ordinary meeting in Vienna on June 25th, in addition to the abnormal April meeting. Elsewhere, China has offered Iran USD 3bln oilfield deal, would bring 90,000 BPD in sixth months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.76% at 2636, NASDAQ +0.70% at 7083, DJI +0.67% at 24368.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +0.90%, Materials +1.44%, Industrials +1.40%, Cons Discretionary +0.57%, Cons Staples +0.34%, Healthcare +0.78%, Financials +0.46%, Tech +0.53%, Telecoms -0.44%, Utilities +0.14%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Chipmakers and trade-sensitive stocks came under pressure after US authorities banned the sale of chips to Huawei over its handling of US trade secrets, raising pressure on US-China trade tensions; also weighed down by disappointing earnings from Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM). Morgan Stanley (MS) concluded the financial heavyweights Q4 earnings with disappointing top and bottom line figures, underpinned by a particularly weak Fixed Income division, making it an underperformer. M&amp;T Bank (MTB) outperformed however after strong top and bottom line figures. CBS (CBS) benefitted from an upgrade at MoffettNathanson. Looking at the FAANGs, minor gains in Facebook (FB) and GOOGL (GOOGL) helped indices from falling off, Apple (AAPL) dropped on reports of it cutting staff hiring and Netflix (NFLX) traded in the red ahead of its earnings report after market. Electronic Arts (EA) underperformed after a downgrade at Jefferies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 121-16+. </strong>Treasuries were lower on Thursday despite the ongoing government shutdown and the trade dispute with China, supported by stronger than expected Philly Fed Index and pushing investors away from the safe-haven. The complex was near session lows at settlement after reports suggesting the US is considering lifting China trade tariffs; most of the action was concentrated in the front/belly end of the curve were yields were higher by c.3bps and the long-end floating around the unchanged mark. The Treasury sold USD 13bln in 10yr TIPS tailing by 0.6bps at a high yield of 0.919%. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.42x. Looking at the breakdown, indirects took most of the supply, directs were awarded the biggest share since July while dealers were left with the smallest share in a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Dollar remains on its upwards trajectory as US yields rise following the release of overall optimistic Philly Fed release, which provided some relief amid the lack of data due to the US government shutdown. Earlier gains stemmed from the rising tensions between US and China after reports that US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against Huawei due to theft of trade secrets, while separate reports stated that US lawmakers are attempting to pass a bill to ban chip sales to Huawei and ZTE. In a response, China strongly urged US lawmakers not to pass this bill. As such DXY reached intraday highs of 96.250 (vs low of 96.000) and remained above its 100 DMA at 96.040 throughout most of the session despite some pullback on reports that the US is considering lifting China tariffs leaving the index more or less flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> &nbsp;Safe-haven demand has aided the Yen gain ground against a rising buck as USD/JPY remained sub-109.00 since the EU open but traded choppy amidst the indecisive risk tone in a range of 108.69-109.39 as huge offers around the top of the band limiting upside. In terms of option expiries, tomorrow sees a colossal 3.0bln worth of 109.00-10 strikes due to expire at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Little changed and nearer to the bottom of a 1.1372-1.1410 intraday range in what has been a choppy day for the single currency, nonetheless EUR/USD is poised for a third consecutive day of losses and hovered under 1.1400 for most of the session after largely shrugging off in-line EZ inflation figures and comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager. EUR/USD resided just above its 50 DMA at 1.1380 while in terms of option expiries, tomorrow sees some 4bln scattered between 1.1400-25 strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The day&rsquo;s outperformer following PM May&rsquo;s marginal victory at the vote of no confidence. Sterling moved sideways in early EU trade as participants were reluctant to enter positions after the vote-induced spike higher. However, GBP/USD grinded higher despite a firmer dollar amid hopes of an extension to Article 50 which would delay the Brexit day, though the EU and a PM May spokesman acknowledged that the UK has not requested this yet; the pair extended gains after Downing St has said the govt has produced &lsquo;a very short paper&rsquo; suggesting it will take one year to organise another referendum. Cable traded in a 1.2834-1.300 range and remained just above its 100 DMA at 1.2893 throughout most of the session ahead of UK retail sales tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The antipodeans continued their decline as the softer risk sentiment and global growth fears weighs on the high-beta currencies. NZD/USD underperformed as the pair broke below its 200 DMA and printed a session low of 0.6728 with the next support seen around 0.6726 ahead of further support at 0.6700. Meanwhile the AUD/USD was relatively flat as the falling Kiwi mitigates the impact of the rising dollar as AUD/NZD rose in close proximity of 1.065 (vs low of 1.057).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie meanwhile, was largely affected by falling oil prices alongside the rising buck as USD/CAD reached highs just shy of 1.3320 (vs. low if 1.3250) ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.3181.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>EM FX was heavily weight on by a firmer greenback. The Ran also underwent the South African interest rate decision where the Central Bank stood pat on rates at 6.75% whilst downgraded its 2019 and 2020 inflation forecasts. Subsequently, USD/ZAR rose to session highs of 13.8300 vs lows of 13.6750.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY &ndash; King Dollar remains on its upwards trajectory with recent upside exacerbated by upside in US yields following the release of overall optimistic Philly Fed release, which provided some relief amid the lack of data due to the US government shutdown. Earlier gains stemmed from the rising tensions between US and China after reports that US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against Huawei due to theft of trade secrets, while separate reports stated that US lawmakers are attempting to pass a bill to ban chip sales to Huawei and ZTE. In a response, China strongly urged US lawmakers not to pass this bill. As such DXY reached intraday highs of 96.250 (vs low of 96.000) and remained above its 100 DMA at 96.040 throughout most of the session ahead of comment from Fed voter Quarles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Safe-haven demand has aided the Yen gain ground against a rising buck as USD/JPY remained sub-109.00 since the EU open but traded choppy amidst the indecisive risk tone in a range of 108.69-109.12 as huge offers around the top of the band limiting upside. In terms of option expiries, tomorrow sees a colossal 3.0bln worth of 109.00-10 strikes due to expire at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Little changed and nearer to the bottom of a 1.1372-1.1410 intraday range in what has been a choppy day for the single currency, nonetheless EUR/USD is poised for a third consecutive day of losses and hovered under 1.1400 for most of the session after largely shrugging off in-line EZ inflation figures and comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager. EUR/USD resided just above its 50 DMA at 1.1380 while in terms of option expiries, tomorrow sees some 4bln scattered between 1.1400-25 strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - &nbsp;The day&rsquo;s outperformer following PM May&rsquo;s marginal victory at the vote of no confidence. Sterling moved sideways in early EU trade as participants were reluctant to enter positions after the vote-induced spike higher. However, GBP/USD grinded higher despite a firmer dollar amid hopes of an extension to Article 50 which would delay the Brexit day, though the EU and a PM May spokesman acknowledged that the UK has not requested this yet. Furthermore, the Evening Standard reported that up to 20 ministers (middle-ranking and junior) will resign if the Premier orders them to stop Parliament taking control over Brexit, another signal of the Government&rsquo;s weakened position. Cable traded in a 1.2834-1.2923 range, and remained just above its 100 DMA at 1.2893 throughout most of the session ahead of UK retail sales tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD,NZD - &nbsp;The antipodeans continued their decline as the softer risk sentiment and global growth fears weighs on the high-beta currencies. NZD/USD underperformed as the pair broke below its 200 DMA and printed a session low of 0.6728 with the next support seen around 0.6726 ahead of further support at 0.6700. Meanwhile the AUD/USD was relatively flat as the falling Kiwi mitigates the impact of the rising dollar as AUD/NZD rose in close proximity of 1.065 (vs low of 1.057).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; The Loonie meanwhile, was largely affected by falling oil prices alongside the rising buck as USD/CAD reached highs just shy of 1.3320 (vs. low if 1.3250) ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.3181.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash; EM FX was heavily weight on by a firmer greenback. The Ran also underwent the South African interest rate decision where the Central Bank stood pat on rates at 6.75% whilst downgraded its 2019 and 2020 inflation forecasts. Subsequently, USD/ZAR rose to session highs of 13.8300 vs lows of 13.6750.</p>\r\n",

In terms of the latest, US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against the company over trade secret theft, while separate reports noted that US lawmakers are looking to pass a bill which bans chip sales to Huawei and ZTE. In response, the Chinese Foreign ministry urged US lawmakers to stop this bill. On the technical front the index sits just above its 100 DMA at 96.045 ahead of its 50 DMA at 96.639, just below the 2019 peak at 96.960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY&ndash;&nbsp; The Yen firmer on the back of safe-haven demand amid the aforementioned Huawei-related US-Sino tensions. USD/JPY retreats further below the recently-claimed 109.00 level to a low of 108.72 as the pair is underpinned by its 50 HMA around the intraday low. In terms of option expiries, nothing major to report today, however tomorrow sees some USD 3bln between 109.00-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The Euro was largely unreactive to the in-line December inflation figures as the single currency continues to move in tandem with the Dollar, thus EUR/USD has experienced a relatively choppy session in the range of 1.1372-1.1404 ahead of comments from ECB-hawk Lautenschlager who is due to speak in Dublin at 1100GMT following a recently published interview in which she said she will wait for the March projections before changing her view about a rate hike this year. In terms of option expiries, tomorrow sees 4bln scattered between 1.1400-25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Sideways action following PM May&rsquo;s victory at last night&rsquo;s Labour-tabled vote of no confidence in which the Premier defeated the motion via 325 vs 306 votes, as expected. Sterling sold off with Cable re-testing 1.2700 to the downside in the run up to the results before spiking higher to levels just shy of 1.2900 upon the announcement. In terms of the latest, Spanish press reported that the EU are to condition any potential delay to Brexit on an agreement being struck between UK PM May and opposition leader Corbyn, though Sterling was unreactive to this as Corbyn already made it clear that he will not hold talks with the Premier until a no-deal Brexit is off the table. GBP/USD action is largely dominated by Dollar fluctuation as the pair remains choppy sub-1.2900 and below its 100 DMA at 1.2893.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The antipodeans continue their decline from the prior session as the softer risk sentiment and global growth fears weighs on the high-beta currencies. NZD/USD underperforms as the pair broke below its 200 DMA and printed a&nbsp; session low of 0.6731 with the next support seen around 0.6726 ahead of further support at 0.6700. Meanwhile the AUD/USD is relatively flat as the falling Kiwi mitigates the impact of the rising dollar as AUD/NZD rose to close proximity of 1.065 (vs low of 1.057).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU and UK debt has had an uneventful open, with both 10-year benchmarks essentially unchanged vs. yesterday&rsquo;s closes of 164.56 and 122.70 respectively after UK PM May&rsquo;s Government unsurprisingly survived the Labour vote of no confidence. Participants are now looking out for commentary ahead of the Plan B presentation on Monday, with source reports already stating that the EU believe that the UK PM&rsquo;s attempts to gain support have come too late, alongside suggestions that EU plans are being drawn up for a Brexit extension to 2020. In Italy, 10-yr futures are trading with gains of around 20 ticks after comments from Italian PM Conte that their budget is set to be ratified by the cabinet later today, with suggestions alongside this that the League party are looking for a far-right political partner to join the Government. Traders in Europe will now be looking out for further comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager, who stated this morning that she is data-driven and thinks the EZ is still is in the projected environment, with BoE&rsquo;s Carney also set to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are outperforming their European counterparts, with the Huawei-driven trade tensions that weighed on the Asia-Pac equity space laying some downward pressure on yields across the curve, with the longer end underperforming. This also comes after the Fed&rsquo;s Beige Book release which, whilst noting a strong US labour market, cited trade and financial volatility as worries. Market participants will now be looking out for the Philly Fed and the Initial Jobless Claims releases, alongside Fed speak set to come from the Hawkish voter Quarles later in the day. On the supply side USD 13bln is up for grabs in the US&rsquo;s 10yr TIPS Auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.2%) prices hover under USD 61/bbl and USD 52/bbl respectively, weighed on by the record EIA US crude production figure of 11.9mln BPD for the previous week, an increase from the prior of 11.7mln BPD; a level which was already the largest national output globally. Elsewhere, it has been reported that Russian Energy Minister Novak and Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih are to meet at next weeks Davos summit. Separately, Libyan oil ports Es Sider, Zueitina and Hariga have reportedly reopened following weather improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) has traded within a narrow USD 4/oz range, as the dollar has also traded largely unchanged due to a lack of catalysts. Elsewhere, the US Senate voted to reject legislation to keep sanctions on companies linked to Oleg Deripaska, including Rusal. Separately, steel company Voestalpine have issued their second profit warning in 4 months; citing US plant operating problems and cartel investigation provisions as the cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC monthly report: OPEC crude production fell 751k bpd in December to average 31.58mln bpd, according to secondary sources with cuts led by Saudi Arabia, Librya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libyan oil ports Es Sider, Zueitina and Hariga have reopened as the weather improved; according to a port worker.

USD/JPY retreats further below the recently-claimed 109.00 level to a low of 108.72 as the pair is underpinned by its 50 HMA around the intraday low.

In terms of option expiries, tomorrow sees 4bln scattered between 1.1400-25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Sideways action following PM May&rsquo;s victory at last night&rsquo;s Labour-tabled vote of no confidence in which the Premier defeated the motion via 325 vs 306 votes, as expected. Sterling sold off with Cable re-testing 1.2700 to the downside in the run up to the results before spiking higher to levels just shy of 1.2900 upon the announcement. In terms of the latest, Spanish press reported that the EU are to condition any potential delay to Brexit on an agreement being struck between UK PM May and opposition leader Corbyn, though Sterling was unreactive to this as Corbyn already made it clear that he will not hold talks with the Premier until a no-deal Brexit is off the table. GBP/USD action is largely dominated by Dollar fluctuation as the pair remains choppy sub-1.2900 and below its 100 DMA at 1.2893.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The antipodeans continue their decline from the prior session as the softer risk sentiment and global growth fears weighs on the high-beta currencies. NZD/USD underperforms as the pair broke below its 200 DMA and printed a&nbsp; session low of 0.6731 with the next support seen around 0.6726 ahead of further support at 0.6700. Meanwhile the AUD/USD is relatively flat as the falling Kiwi mitigates the impact of the rising dollar as AUD/NZD rose to close proximity of 1.065 (vs low of 1.057)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU and UK debt has had an uneventful open, with both 10-year benchmarks essentially unchanged vs. yesterday&rsquo;s closes of 164.56 and 122.70 respectively after UK PM May&rsquo;s Government unsurprisingly survived the Labour vote of no confidence. Participants are now looking out for commentary ahead of the Plan B presentation on Monday, with source reports already stating that the EU believe that the UK PM&rsquo;s attempts to gain support have come too late, alongside suggestions that EU plans are being drawn up for a Brexit extension to 2020. In Italy, 10-yr futures are trading with gains of around 20 ticks after comments from Italian PM Conte that their budget is set to be ratified by the cabinet later today, with suggestions alongside this that the League party are looking for a far-right political partner to join the Government. Traders in Europe will now be looking out for further comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager, who stated this morning that she is data-driven and thinks the EZ is still is in the projected environment, with BoE&rsquo;s Carney also set to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are outperforming their European counterparts, with the Huawei-driven trade tensions that weighed on the Asia-Pac equity space laying some downward pressure on yields across the curve, with the longer end underperforming. This also comes after the Fed&rsquo;s Beige Book release which, whilst noting a strong US labour market, cited trade and financial volatility as worries. Market participants will now be looking out for the Philly Fed and the Initial Jobless Claims releases, alongside Fed speak set to come from the Hawkish voter Quarles later in the day. On the supply side USD 13bln is up for grabs in the US&rsquo;s 10yr TIPS Auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.9%) and WTI (-1.1%) prices are around USD 61/bbl and USD 52/bbl respectively, weighed on by the record EIA US crude production figure of 11.9mln BPD for the previous week, an increase from the prior of 11.7mln BPD; a level which was already the largest national output globally. Elsewhere, it has been reported that Russian Energy Minister Novak and Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih are to meet at next weeks Davos summit. Separately, Libyan oil ports Es Sider, Zueitina and Hariga have reportedly reopened following weather improvements. Looking ahead the OPEC monthly report is due to be published today at 11:30 GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) has traded within a narrow USD 4/oz range, as the dollar has also traded largely unchanged due to a lack of catalysts. Elsewhere, the US Senate voted to reject legislation to keep sanctions on companies linked to Oleg Deripaska, including Rusal. Separately, steel company Voestalpine have issued their second profit warning in 4 months; citing US plant operating problems and cartel investigation provisions as the cause.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Core EU and UK debt has had an uneventful open, with both 10-year benchmarks essentially unchanged vs. yesterday&rsquo;s closes of 164.56 and 122.70 respectively after UK PM May&rsquo;s Government unsurprisingly survived the Labour vote of no confidence. Participants are now looking out for commentary ahead of the Plan B presentation on Monday, with source reports already stating that the EU believe that the UK PM&rsquo;s attempts to gain support have come too late, alongside suggestions that EU plans are being drawn up for a Brexit extension to 2020. In Italy, 10-year futures are the European underperformer, albeit by a hair vs. Gilts, after comments from Italian PM Conte that their budget is set to be ratified by the cabinet later today, with suggestions alongside this that the League party are looking for a far-right political partner to join the Government. Traders in Europe will now be looking out for further comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager, who stated this morning that she is data-driven and thinks the EZ is still is in the projected environment, with BoE&rsquo;s Carney also set to speak. In terms of supply, the UK will be selling GBP 2.5bln in their 1% 2024 Gilt auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are outperforming their European counterparts, with the Huawei-driven trade tensions that weighed on the Asia-Pac equity space laying some downward pressure on yields across the curve, with the longer end underperforming. This also comes after the Fed&rsquo;s Beige Book release which, whilst noting a strong US labour market, cited trade and financial volatility as worries. Market participants will now be looking out for the Philly Fed and the Initial Jobless Claims releases, alongside Fed speak set to come from the Hawkish voter Quarles later in the day. On the supply side USD 13bln is up for grabs in the US&rsquo;s 10yr TIPS Auction.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, a spokesperson for PM May said the government&#39;s policy is to be out of a customs union so it can do new trade deals, while UK PM May is said to plan to speak to EU leaders today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said there is now an opportunity to find a way forward on the Brexit and that she intends to deliver on Brexit which she believes it is her duty to do so. PM May also said we must work out what lawmakers want and that she spoke to several parties although the Labour party leader has yet to take part in discussions, while there were comments from Labour Party leader Corbyn who declared there will be no talks with PM May until a no-deal Brexit is off the table. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a leaked conference call, UK Chancellor Hammond told business leaders that the &ldquo;threat&rdquo; of a no-deal Brexit could be taken &ldquo;off the table&rdquo; within days and potentially lead to Article 50 &ldquo;rescinded&rdquo;. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is said to think PM May&#39;s attempt to win the support for her Brexit deal has come too late and will probably not work now, while a diplomatic note warned that extending Article 50 to delay Brexit would not be as simple as some people assume. Furthermore, the EU is reportedly divided on how long Brexit extension can last and is said to discuss Brexit extension beyond July, while there were separate reports that the EU is looking at plans for Brexit extension to 2020 according. (BuzzFeed/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK RICS Housing Survey Dec -19 vs. Exp. -13.0 (Prev. -11.0). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian PM Conte says Cabinet is to approve budget later today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greek Prime Minister Tsipras won confidence vote in Greece&#39;s Parliament (by 151 vs 148). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets lacked drivers overnight although the DXY eked mild gains above the 96.00 level, while its major counterparts were lacklustre in which EUR/USD backed away from the 1.1400 handle and GBP/USD consolidated near the prior day&rsquo;s highs. This follows PM May&rsquo;s confidence vote survival by a narrow margin of 325 to 306 votes and with PM May now seen to seek a cross-party Brexit consensus to break the stalemate. Elsewhere, the initial deterioration in risk appetite spurred flows into JPY and high-beta currencies were indecisive alongside a similar risk tone before giving up ground to the greenback, while CNH softened despite the firmer fix by the PBoC as the central bank continued with its substantial liquidity efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lacklustre amid a firming greenback and choppy risk tone which saw WTI crude futures pull-back below the USD 52.00/bbl level. This also followed the post-DoE pressure in which a wider than expected draw in headline crude inventories was overshadowed by the much larger than expected build in gasoline and distillate stockpiles. Elsewhere, gold was subdued as USD eked marginal gains, while price action in copper reflected the indecisive overnight sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Vice President Pence said North Korea has yet to take concrete action to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more constructive risk tone saw Treasuries sold on Wednesday. APAC volume was light and the range was narrow, and into the EU session, there was a downside bias after liquidation of 5yr call spreads, Informa reported, while lower Gilts were also influencing FI ahead of the confidence vote. There was some stabilisation towards the US open, though pressure in the long-end was seen, helping the curve steepen. After the UK confidence vote, where UK PM May survived, there was some selling of the T-Note, though it remained within the day&rsquo;s range. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, and generally +/- around 1bps. US T-note futures (H9) settled 6 ticks lower at 121-23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Beige Book stated economic activity expanded in most of the US with eight of the twelve districts reporting modest-to-moderate growth, while all noted tight labour markets at all skill levels. Furthermore, many districts reported contacts had become less optimistic due to rising financial market volatility, rising short-term rates, falling energy prices, as well as elevated trade and political uncertainty. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s George (Voter, Hawk) said portfolio runoff could offer &quot;fair explanation&quot; for some of the recent market volatility, while she added the Fed should be more patient in raising rates to avoid overtightening and to extend the expansion. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove) said Fed has less room to cut rates in future downturn but has other tools, while he repeated that he wants to see wage growth and inflation before backing a rate hike.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets were choppy throughout the session but eventually followed suit to the gains on Wall St, where financials led after strong earnings from banking powerhouses Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) were mixed as resilience in financials and commodity-related sectors kept the Australian benchmark afloat, while Tokyo trade was hampered again by currency effects. Hang Seng (Unch.) briefly surmounted the 27,000 level for the first time since early December where it then met resistance and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) swung between gains and losses as participants digested another substantial liquidity operation by the PBoC, as well as US-China concerns after reports that US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against Huawei over theft of trade secrets. Finally, 10yr JGB futures recovered from the prior day&rsquo;s lows but with price action kept range-bound on the session alongside the indecisive risk tone in the region and a relatively tepid Rinban announcement by the BoJ.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are subdued as the momentum from Wall St, where financials led following strong earnings from banking powerhouses Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, eventually dissipated. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are mixed with resilience in financials and commodity-related sectors keeping the Australian benchmark afloat, while Tokyo trade is hampered again by currency effects. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are lacklustre and fail to benefit from another substantial liquidity operation by the PBoC, with sentiment dampened by US-China concerns after reports that US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against Huawei over theft of trade secrets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets lack firm drivers overnight with the DXY flat around the 96.00 level, while its major counterparts are uneventful with EUR/USD continuing to eye the 1.1400 handle to the upside and GBP/USD consolidating near the prior day&rsquo;s highs. This follows PM May&rsquo;s confidence vote survival by a narrow margin of 325 to 306 votes and the PM is also seen to seek a cross-party Brexit consensus to break the Brexit stalemate. Elsewhere, the deterioration in risk appetite spurred flows into JPY and has weighed on high-beta currencies, while CNH has softened despite the firmer fix by the PBoC as the central bank continued with its substantial liquidity efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGB futures have recovered from the prior day&rsquo;s lows but with price action kept range-bound on the session amid the indecisive risk tone in the region and relatively tepid Rinban announcement by the BoJ.</p>\r\n",
