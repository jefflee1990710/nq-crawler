Furthermore, participants are unlikely to flood to risk in anticipation of the critical Iowa caucus - results due later Monday – which provides an initial indication of the footing of the Democratic candidates and thus the likelihood of their policies.

According to some reports, China is now to reportedly review its 2020 economic growth target amid the coronavirus outbreak, sources said; it currently targets GDP growth between 6.0-6.5%, and last week, a Chinese government economist stated China Q1 growth could fall below 5% due to the virus (his forecast was based on the assumption that the virus outbreak will peak by mid-February and end by March-end). Other economists have suggested it could drop to 4.5% on a Y/Y basis, the lowest since readings began in 1992. Additionally, reports have suggested that China is looking for flexibility on Phase One trade pledges, likely in relation to the coronavirus' effect on China's growth. The Phase One is due to take effect mid-February, which does note that US and China will consult \"in the event that a natural disaster or unforeseeable events\" steer either country from compliance. Sources noted that it was unclear if China formally requested such consultations. Politico later reported, citing the USTR, that there had been no formal requests by China on purchase flexibility but observers say US President Trump could provide some leeway if the numbers are heading in the right direction. In terms of the market's view, naturally, the first point will be to monitor the number of cases being reported, for a sign of a peak. Additionally, while GDP growth may take a hit in Q1 (both globally, and for China), analysts are confident that we'd see a Q2 rebound. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/macro-view-morgan-stanley-says-virus-to-weigh-on-growth-but-won-t-derail-the-global-recovery-expect-q2-rebound-03-02-2020\">Full analysis here.</a></p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING ISM (JAN)</strong>: The headline beat expectations, at 50.9 against the consensus 48.5, and rising from the prior revised up 47.8. The other components also fared well relative to expectations. Pantheon Macroeconomics said this was welcome news, and consistent with the regional reports. However, Pantheon notes that the survey mostly predates the coronavirus. \"We have to expect a setback next month as demand from China drops and supply chains are interrupted.\" Looking at the details, the upside in January was on the back of a 9.5-point leap in the production component, with PM says suggests that the hit from the suspension of production of the 737MAX was absorbed in December; New orders were rose also up to an eight-month high; ahead of this week's payrolls report, the employment sub-index nudged up. \"The story here is that the signing of the Phase One trade deal appears to have boosted activity, triggering a narrowing of the gap between the level of the actual level of the index and the level implied by China’s PMIs, which usually lead the ISM by about three months,\" Pantheon writes, \"we would be hopeful of further progress if it weren’t for the coronavirus, but that progress now will be delayed, likely by several months, at least.\"</p><p><strong>* IOWA CAUCUS:</strong> The Iowa Caucus may set the tone for the rest of the Democrat's presidential nomination race. Observers note that over the last 11 Iowa Dem caucuses, there have only been two occasions where the winner did not secure the Democrat Presidential nomination. A single candidate has not managed to secure a majority of support, according to an average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics; former VP Biden leads the field (polling at around 27% nationwide), followed by Sanders (around 24%), and then Warren (around 15%). For reference, in 2016, Sanders took 49.6% of the vote vs Hillary Clinton's 49.8%, suggesting he is a 'known' quantity which Iowans have warmed to in the past; Sanders also performed well in New Hampshire in 2016, the next key race for Dem candidates (11/Feb). Looking at an average of specific Iowa polls, Sanders is ahead at 24%, Biden follows at 20%, followed by Buttigieg at 16%; Warren is currently in fourth place, polling at under 15%, according to Real Clear Politics. If Biden wins, analysts do not expect a negative reaction for risk since he is the 'establishment' choice, and additionally, equities rose during his tenure as VP. However, it will likely be negative for US risk assets if it confirms loss of front-runner status for Joe Biden. There are greater risks with Sanders and Warren, who have both advocated policies that entail higher taxes and regulations and have targeted large tech companies and health care names, which could present risks for equities. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-iowa-caucus-today-to-set-the-tone-for-the-presidential-race-jpm-thinks-biden-is-best-case-scenario-for-markets-03-02-2020\">Full analysis here.</a></p><p><strong>* RBA PREVIEW:</strong> RBA Monetary Policy Decision, Tuesday 4th February at 0330GMT/2130CST/1130HKT. The RBA are expected to stand pat on rates with markets currently assigning a 72% chance of an unchanged rate at 0.75%. There has been a shift in expectations for when the RBA will act next with numerous banks recently pushing back their calls for action following key data releases. Uncertainties over the impact of the Coronavirus fallout and Australian bush fires could support the case for keeping the Bank’s powder dry. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23773/download\">Full analysis here.</a></p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier and UK PM Johnson set out their terms for future relationship negotiations. Weekend press suggested UK PM Johnson would set out a hard-line stance in response to the EU stating there is “no need” to accept various EU rules in a trade deal and was said to be prepared to walk away if he was not satisfied with the deal – Johnson’s speech was more toned down than press reports had suggested. Meanwhile, Barnier’s draft mandate suggested the EU should have possibility to apply interim measures to react to disruptions of equal conditions of competition. The FT highlighted that this is linking market access to alignment, in opposition to UK PM Johnson’s view. However, Barnier did note the EU wants an ambitious partnership but there must be a level playing field to reach an agreement, the EU is also ready to offer a deal of zero tariffs and quotas on all goods, but it must include a deal on fisheries and reciprocal access to waters. In response, UK PM Johnson, as per weekend with suggestions, stated that there is no need for a FTA to involve the acceptance of EU rules, noting the UK does not insist the EU does everything we do as a price for free trade.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB’s Lane stated that Eurozone inflation will eventually pick up amid rising labour costs and help the ECB hit its target. ECB’s VP de Guindos stated the ECB is beginning to see signs of stabilisation on a global level, whilst noting inflation will hover around current levels over the next 12 months. Weidmann reiterated he is critical of the large purchases of government bonds in the euro area, as he believes it should be an emergency tool because they “run the risk of blurring the dividing line between monetary and fiscal policy.” <strong>Ahead of its strategic review</strong>, Weidmann noted the new inflation target should rid the perception that the ECB can control inflation to a tenth of a percent, adding the target should be simplified, but it must avoid large increases to its goal. While, VP de Guindos stated a much more symmetrical definition of price stability will be needed.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.71% at 3248, NDX +1.50% at 9126, DJI +0.51% at 28,400.</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary +0.60%, Utilities +0.32%, Consumer Staples -0.01%, Communication Services +1.27%, Health Care +0.93%, Financials +0.60%, Materials +2.13%, Industrials -0.04%, It +1.32%, Energy -1.34%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Nike (NKE) sat at the top of the Dow after an upgrade at UBS, citing business changes, and an Analyst Focus List pick at JPMorgan, citing innovation and product pipeline. Tesla (TSLA) made double digit gains, surpassing USD 700/share, following ARK Invest setting a 2024 base case PT of USD 7,000, citing optimism in the Co’s cost-cutting and margin widening ability, and to some extent, the potential for autonomous vehicle adoption. Merck (MRK) was firmer amid a priority review granting for a pneumonia treatment. Ahead of earnings reports, Google (GOOGL) and Disney (DIS) were top performers. Gilead Sciences (GILD) spiked higher as it announced it is working on a treatment for the coronavirus. L Brands (LB) pared some gains following a negative NY Times piece taking aim at its CEO and other executives in the Victoria’s Secret business. Sysco (SYY) tumbled lower on a disappointing revenue figure and a cut to guidance. Energy (XLE, XOP) was the underperforming sector as coronavirus concerns hit energy prices; Exxon Mobil (XOM) was also victim to a downgrade at Goldman Sachs to Sell. Also suffering from downgrades: Verizon (VZ) and ViacomCBS (VIAC) both at Credit Suisse, Electronic Arts (EA) at BMO, Northrop Grumman (NOC) at Goldman. Meanwhile, benefitting from upgrades: Ulta (ULTA) at Goldman, Charter Communications (SHTR) at Credit Suisse.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.45 LOWER AT USD 50.11/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLED USD 2.17 LOWER AT USD 54.45/BBL</strong>: The Crude benchmarks found no reprieve from the bearish tone on Monday, falling to 52-week lows as the coronavirus further hampered demand expectations out of China, the world’s largest oil importer. Chinese equity bourses reopened after the Lunar New Year holiday to sizeable losses, coming alongside sources reports that China’s Sinopec, due to reduced demand, was reducing its oil refinery throughput by 600k BPD, as well as cutting its West African crude purchases. Note that the majority of the oil price declines were felt as Europeans wrapped up for the day, after previously remaining little changed, where comments coming out of OPEC likely kept some support on the bid: due to the coronavirus, the group is considering further oil output cuts of 500k BPD with most members agreeing on the need for further cuts – pencilling February 14/15 for the updated OPEC+ meeting. Furthermore, WSJ reported citing sources that Saudi Arabia is mulling a drastic temporary cut of up to 1mln BPD as one scenario, whilst it leading the aforementioned 500k BPD cut as another until the coronavirus crisis ends. However, as the session proceeded, in the tail-end of Europe’s day, the crude complex was heavily offered in what appeared to be a technical break lower as front-month WTI and Brent futures fell through their October lows – 50.99 for WTI and 56.15 for Brent, seeing contango in the Brent term structure. This weeks US inventories are expected to show (bbls): crude stocks +3mln, distillates +0.5mln and Gasoline +2.1mln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLED 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 131-18+:</strong> The T-Note traded choppy, paring back its losses made in the European session, with the 10-year yield floating modestly above the 1.50% figure at settlement. Although the US ISM Manufacturing report was stellar by all accounts for January, concerns linger as the coronavirus outbreak is yet to express itself in the data; Chinese officials have already warned of cuts to its growth figures. Furthermore, participants are unlikely to flood to risk in anticipation of the critical Iowa caucus - results due later Monday – which provides an initial indication of the footing of the Democratic candidates and thus the likelihood of their policies. By settlement, yields were little changed at the long-end, whilst the short-end rose: 2s30s -4bps, 2s10s -2bps, 2s5s -1bps.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> traded firmer following strong ISM manufacturing PMI’s and a fall out in GBP all ahead of tonight’s Iowa caucus. DXY surpassed its 200 dma at 97.72 to highs of 97.89, before paring back to its 100 dma at 97.83. <strong>GBP</strong> the underperformer following reports UK PM Johnson was set to take a hard-line stance against the EU, stating there is no need to accept various rules in the trade deal, and that he was ready to walk away from a deal if he was not happy with it. <strong>EUR</strong> was weaker remaining around the 1.1050 mark against the buck, amid broad dollar strength, although EURGBP regained 0.85 to the upside due to sterling woes. <strong>JPY</strong> weaker amid support measures from China to comfort coronavirus damage, whilst also weakening further after strong PMI figures. <strong>XAU</strong> also lost ground, although remains above the 1575 handle. <strong>AUD</strong> traded flat ahead of tonight’s rate decision, <strong>NZD</strong> also rangebound. <strong>EMFX</strong> was genuinely firmer amid an improved risk environment, although <strong>TRY</strong> the relative underperformer amid a pick-up in inflation. However, CapEco highlight it is unlikely to see the CBRT change course at its next meeting as policymakers continue to face pressure from President Erdogan to lower rates.</p>",

Chinese equity bourses reopened after the Lunar New Year holiday to sizeable losses, coming alongside sources reports that China’s Sinopec, due to reduced demand, was reducing its oil refinery throughput by 600k BPD, as well as cutting its West African crude purchases. Note that the majority of the oil price declines were felt as Europeans wrapped up for the day, after previously remaining little changed, where comments coming out of OPEC likely kept some support on the bid: due to the coronavirus, the group is considering further oil output cuts of 500k BPD with most members agreeing on the need for further cuts – pencilling February 14/15 for the updated OPEC+ meeting. Furthermore, WSJ reported citing sources that Saudi Arabia is mulling a drastic temporary cut of up to 1mln BPD as one scenario, whilst it leading the aforementioned 500k BPD cut as another until the coronavirus crisis ends. However, as the session proceeded, in the tail-end of Europe’s day, the crude complex was heavily offered in what appeared to be a technical break lower as front-month WTI and Brent futures fell through their October lows – 50.99 for WTI and 56.15 for Brent, seeing contango in the Brent term structure. This weeks US inventories are expected to show (bbls): crude stocks +3mln, distillates +0.5mln and Gasoline +2.1mln.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: USD rampant on GBP softness and solid ISM, Yuan yields on WuFlu woes",
        "content": "<p><strong>Yuan</strong></p><p>The CNH remained on the backfoot throughout the European session following the steep downside in its onshore counterpart after China returned from its extended holiday to react to the cumulative coronavirus developments. Furthermore, China’s barrage of measures in an attempt to stem losses in cash markets could’ve played part in Yuan losses – actions which included lowering rates on its 7- and 14-day reverse repos by 10bps each. USD/CNY closed onshore trade around 7.0250, having eclipsed its 100 DMA at 7.0223 (vs. 6.9364 close on Jan 23rd). Meanwhile, the offshore CNH held onto its losses and meandered north of 7.000 having found modest support at 7.0100, with little reaction to unsurprising source reports of a potential growth target revamp by the Chinese government, which some noted could fall below 5% (vs. current target of 6.0-6.5%), although sources in December noted that China may reduce its 2020 target to “around 6%”.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>A day of gains for the broad Dollar and index, initially more-so on the Sterling’s demise (see below) in which DXY took out its 50 and 200 DMAs to the upside (97.47 and 97.72 respectively) before an overall solid ISM Manufacturing PMI report pushed the index above its 100 DMA (~97.84) ahead of the 98.00 mark. Next up, traders will be eyeing the Iowa caucus to give a lens into the Democratic presidential candidate (results expected around 08:30pm ET).</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling stands as the G10 laggard heading into the European close with initial downside influenced by weekend reports that UK PM Johnson is to take a hard stance regarding the post-Brexit negotiation – seen as inevitable friction heading into trade talks with the EU. Remarks from the UK PM thereafter were largely in-fitting with what was alluded to in UK press, whilst EU’s draft mandate largely stuck its script, emphasising the level playing field and the inclusion of fisheries and reciprocal access to waters. GBP/USD gapped lower at the open to sub-1.3200 levels before continuing its downwards trajectory heading into the key speakers. Cable took out Friday’s low (1.3081) and its 50 DMA (1.3075) before finding a base at 1.3050, ahead of potential support at 1.2975 (14th Jan low) and ~1.2950 (January low). Elsewhere, the Single Currency moved largely in tandem with the Buck, with EUR/USD poised to end the European session with a bulk of its intraday losses, having side-lined a slight revision higher to manufacturing PMIs. The pair has clocked in an intraday range of 1.1058-94 heading into the close, with the pair currently below its 100 DMA (1.1069) and with little scheduled on tomorrow’s docket for the EUR.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Both poised the end the EU session flat/with modest gains. AUD/USD reverted back towards the 0.6700 marks having overcome earlier USD-led downside ahead of the RBA’s rate decision overnight (full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite), with the Bank widely expected to stand pat on its Cash Rate. That said, any commentary regarding the economic outlook against the backdrop of bushfires and contagion from a China slowdown will be given much credence for hints on future policy action. AUD/USD looks to close the European day around mid-range, having clocked an intraday parameter of 0.6684-6707. NZD/USD meanwhile looks to end the session flat around 0.6465 having traded in a tight 0.6450-6475 parameter, with participants looking ahead to tomorrow’s labour market report.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong></p><p>The safe-haven currencies also succumbed to a firmer Dollar amidst a lack of fresh fundamental catalysts and absence of a clear-cut risk tone. USD/JPY meandered around 108.50 throughout a bulk of the European session having traded in a 108.32-70 intraday band. Similarly, USD/CHF trades mid-range heading into the EU close, within a 0.9630-60 daily band.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Reprieve across the EM-sphere, but more-so consolidation following last-week’s hefty losses. RUB, BRL and MXN all saw gains whilst the TRY lags its EM peers. Turkey’s real rates were dragged further into negative territory amid the uptick in January YY inflation which may prompt a pause in the CBRT’s easing cycle, but not a halt given the Turkish President’s agenda on interest rates. USD/TRY treaded water just under 5.9850 with traders also taking stock of Ankara’s deteriorating relationship with Russia due to unrest in Syria’s Idlib. Meanwhile, USD/ZAR retreated back below 15.000 with some noting a correction from last week’s losses alongside profit taking, having clocked in a 14.8665-15.0183 daily range.</p>",

Moreover, China took a barrage of measures, including lowering rates on its 7- and 14-day reverse repos by 10bps each, in an attempt to cushion losses in the markets amid expectations for a tumultuous session.

        "content": "<p>A lacklustre start to the month for the debt complex in Europe as weekend intervention by China has stemmed the substantial sell-off on China’s return but with little in the way of new fundamental negatives around Coronavirus to substantially sour sentiment in Europe. Bunds are comfortably below the 175.0 handle and within proximity to the session low of 174.71; technically, very little support features before the 174.00 handle itself with only a recent low at 174.16 to stem any potential sell-off. From a data perspective this mornings final PMIs out of the EZ were revised marginally higher for January, but such revision was not sufficient to generate any reaction. Focus for UK bonds has been on today’s keynote Brexit speeches firstly from EU’s Brexit Negotiator Barnier, in which he has unveiled the mandate for negotiations and does not appear to contain anything too surprising but does stress the ‘level playing field’ as being central to discussion. We are expecting UK PM Johnson to unveil his mandate at 11:00GMT, in which he is expected to take a somewhat more hard-line stance to talks. Gilts themselves have been relatively unreactive to these comments and if anything, have (unlike Johnson’s leaked remarks) moved slightly more in-line with European action. Away from the core, where Italian debt is slightly more subdued but not by a significant measure. Finally, the broad debt-dip has caused US 10-year yield to revert from recent lows of exactly 1.50, to a high of 1.551 at present. As a reminder November’s PCE was 1.5%.</p>",

Of the 45% of S&amp;P 500 stocks that have reported earnings, 47% have beat EPS expectations (vs a long-term average of 46%); while 37% of firms have beat revenue expectations.</li><li>The combined market cap of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, FB) now accounts for 18% of the index, a level not seen since the tech bubble, GS says. But earnings are less concentrated; these top five stocks represent 14% of profits, the highest since 2015; and over the last three months, the return of these stocks has been more than double of the S&amp;P 500 (19% vs 7%), and has generated 37% of the gains of the index over that timeframe.</li><li>Goldman says lower growth expectations, lower valuations, and greater re-investment suggest the current concentration may be more sustainable than in 2000. In 2000 the five largest stocks (MSFT, CSCO, GE, INTC, XOM) traded at P/E of 47x with anticipated FY2 revenue growth of +15% (realised sales growth was -7%), but today, the top five S&amp;P 500 stocks trade at P/E of 30x and 2021 expected sales growth is around +14%. Additionally, the growth reinvestment ratio of the largest stocks is higher now than in 2000, with today's top companies index leaders in reinvesting into their businesses. The combined 3-year growth investment ratio (capex + R&amp;D spending as a share of cash flow from operations) is 48% versus 21% for the S&amp;P 500; in 2000, the largest stocks reinvestment ratio was 26% versus 34% for the index.</li><li>GS says that for today's top five S&amp;P 500 stocks to to avoid repeating the share price collapse experienced by 2000's top five, they will need to at least meet (preferably exceed) consensus growth expectations, which look for 100bps sales growth deceleration (from 15% in 2020 to 14% in 2021), a 20bps margin expansion (19.5% to 19.7%), and a 600bps EPS growth acceleration (10% to 16%).</li><li>GS thinks this is achievable, based on recent results and management guidance. AAPL saw top and bottom-line beats, with iPhone demand and subscription growth above expectations. MSFT saw top and bottom-line beats, solid earnings across all segments, with management guiding higher margins ahead. AMZN saw top and bottom-line beats, and exceeded the top end of revenue guidance. FB saw top and bottom-line beats, and although slowing growth concerned some traders, advertising trends will likely provide tailwinds ahead.</li><li>GOOG reports after market close on Monday and the consensus expects revenue and EPS growth of +19% and -2%, respectively, GS says, and in the long-term, the GS thinks the company's business mix is expected to shift toward non-advertising revenue, such as the Google Cloud, while YouTube and Google Discover drive returns in the near term.</li><li>During the upcoming week, 94 S&amp;P 500 companies (including two Dow 30 components) are scheduled to report results for Q4, according to FactSet.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>IOWA CAUCUS:</strong></p><ul><li>The Iowa Caucus may set the tone for the rest of the Democrat's presidential nomination race. Observers note that over the last 11 Iowa Dem caucuses, there have only been two occasions where the winner did not secure the Democrat Presidential nomination.</li><li>A single candidate has not managed to secure a majority of support, according to an average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics; former VP Biden leads the field (polling at around 27% nationwide), followed by Sanders (around 24%), and then Warren (around 15%). For reference, in 2016, Sanders took 49.6% of the vote vs Hillary Clinton's 49.8%, suggesting he is a 'known' quantity which Iowans have warmed to in the past; Sanders also performed well in New Hampshire in 2016, the next key race for Dem candidates (11/Feb). Looking at an average of specific Iowa polls, Sanders is ahead at 24%, Biden follows at 20%, followed by Buttigieg at 16%; Warren is currently in fourth place, polling at under 15%, according to Real Clear Politics.</li><li>If Biden wins, analysts do not expect a negative reaction for risk since he is the 'establishment' choice, and additionally, equities rose during his tenure as VP. However, it will likely be negative for US risk assets if it confirms loss of front-runner status for Joe Biden. There are greater risks with Sanders and Warren, who have both advocated policies that entail higher taxes and regulations, and have targeted large tech companies and health care names, which could present risks for equities.</li></ul><p><strong>2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- MARKET SCENARIOS:</strong></p><ul><li>JPM thinks that the best-case scenario for markets is probably Democrat nominee front-runner, and former Vice President, Joe Biden winning the Democrat primaries, defeating Trump in November but facing a Republican Senate, since the bank believes his policy agenda is not particularly disruptive, and would be dead-on-arrival (at least with respect to tax policy) if Congress remains split. JPM thinks Biden's foreign policies would not entail China tariff rollback, but neither would it be so impulsive, which is why a Biden Presidency should result in lower volatility vs a Trump second second term.</li><li>JPM argues Trump's re-election would be the second-best case scenario, since the tax environment would be stable and the deregulation agenda would advance, but it warns that foreign policy could become even more aggressive under a President validated at the ballot box and acquitted during the impeachment process.</li><li>JPM says the worst-case scenarios are either Sanders/Warren Presidencies with full control of the House and Senate, given the implications for corporate taxes and regulatory policy. The second-worst would be a progressive President without control of the Senate, since the regulatory environment can still be influenced via agency appointments, court challenges and enforcement/interpretation of existing statutes, even without whole changes to legislation.</li><li>JPMorgan notes that 2020 is a unique election cycle, arguing that: (1) The incumbent (President Trump) has never been so unpopular (and therefore vulnerable) entering a re-election when the US unemployment rate is so low and the equity market so strong; (2) the Democrats have never fielded a slate of nominees with so many left-of-center contenders (Sanders, Warren), one of whom (Sanders) has narrowed the gap to a centrist in polls and overtaken him in the betting markets; and (3) never has the US Senate undertaken an impeachment trial during an election year, which raises questions about whether Republicans support for Trump could cost them the chamber in November (their majority is just three-seats currently).</li><li>A few factors to keep in mind: JPM says all these scenarios are in play, but it is worth remembering that polls usually carry an anti-incumbent bias that fades as the election approaches; polls carry a margin of error (around 3% when referring to a specific candidates support, and 6% referring to voting intentions); betting markets and polls signal different outcomes, though these markets tend to favour long-shot candidates. Finally, JPM notes that US Presidential elections are decided in 5-10 swing states which vote less consistently for Democrats (as coastal states do) or Republicans (as the West, Mid West and South tends to do). The combined upshot is that it is tough to have a high conviction view on the election's outcome</li><li>JPM says this uncertainty is one reason why it wanted to enter 2020 overweight non-US vs US Equities, but also short USD versus various currencies (high-yielders like MXN, RUB and INR in EM, and reserve currencies like CHF in G10). JPM says that favoring non-US Equities and high-yield currencies will not hedge a progressive lead in the Democratic primaries if the nCov crisis is flaring, but owning CHF (or JPY or Gold) should. \"If we are wrong that China can contain this virus and if the primaries surge to the left, there won’t be much point in discussing a few hedges,\" the bank writes, \"the potential drawdown would be so large that we would need to rethink the merits of a reflation trade for H1.\"</li></ul><p><strong>KEY UPCOMING US ELECTION CAMPAIGN DATES:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>3/Feb: Iowa Caucus</li><li>11/Feb: New Hampshire Primary</li><li>19/Feb: Democrat Debate</li><li>22/Feb: Nevada Caucus</li><li>25/Feb: Democrat Debate</li><li>03/Mar: Super Tuesday (16 Primary/Caucus events)</li><li>NOTE: regarding the terminology, a caucus is run by the party which will select candidates to support for the Presidential nomination based on a system of local gatherings; a primary is a state-wide vote by secret-ballot; the state determines if the vote is closed (only those registered with that party can vote) or open (unaffiliated voters can participate).</li><li>NOTE: While the GOP still has its own primaries and caucuses ahead of the 2020 Presidential Elections in November 2020, President Trump and Vice President Pence will be formally nominated at the August Republican National Convention (24-27th Aug).</li></ul>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Morgan Stanley expects weakness in China Feb-March data to be temporary, which could be seen in other parts of the world too, especially economies exposed to China growth dynamics. But MS says that assuming that the virus is contained within two months, and given its view that the fundamental growth drivers are still intact, we should get back onto the recovery path from Q2 onwards, and the bank sees global growth rising to 3.5% Y/Y by Q1 2021.</li><li><strong>MACRO DATA HAS STABILISED: </strong>Since October, the data has been surprising to the upside, MS says, confirming the inflection of the global cycle, with manufacturing and trade sectors -- which had borne the brunt of the slowdown -- now staging a comeback. MS believes this trend is sustainable given the stabilisation of end-demand, and the completion of the inventory adjustment cycle and a fundamental upturn in Asian tech.</li><li><strong>CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The coronavirus will hit Chinese GDP growth in Q1 (and by extension, global growth, since China accounts for over 16% of global growth); MS says the length of time that business activity in China and global trade and tourism flows are disrupted will determine the final impact on global growth. \"Compared to past episodes, the authorities in China and elsewhere are taking stronger measures to restrict travel to and from affected areas, and various health authorities have issued advisories on self-quarantine post travel to China,\" the bank writes, \"although these responses will disrupt economic activity in the near term and create more volatility, we could also see a stronger rebound from pent-up demand and increased production.\"</li><li><strong>POLICYMAKER SUPPORT: </strong>MS also says that policymakers in China are likely to mitigate the economic impact by accelerating infrastructure spending and implementing other forms of policy support. \"The day-to-day situation remains fluid, but our preliminary assessment is that if things start to normalize in two months’ time (i.e., the number of new cases peaks), year-over-year global growth could be impacted by about 0.15-0.3ppts in Q1 2020, and then get back on the recovery path from Q2.\"</li><li><strong>GROWTH DRIVERS INTACT: </strong>The inflection in the global cycle is being driven by support from monetary and fiscal easing, as well as the easing of trade tensions (which turned supportive in Q4), Morgan Stanley argues. \"Over the last four quarters, the global weighted monetary policy rate has declined to levels below even those seen in 2016, and we think that policy support is unlikely to be withdrawn quickly; indeed, in the last few days the Fed, ECB and BoE have maintained their dovish stance.\"</li><li><strong>POLICYMAKER SUPPORT: </strong>The Fed specifically has also tweaked its view of the outlook, which emphasises its commitment to lifting inflation, reinforcing the high bar for rate hikes in the US. Meanwhile, in China, MS thinks the fiscal stance will remain supportive, with the primary fiscal deficit set to remain high at 8.3% of GDP this year; \"this would be the first time that the government has maintained fiscal deficits at these levels for two years in a row,\" MS observes, \"even before the coronavirus outbreak, policymakers had intensified efforts to support growth by front-loading fiscal spending, and local governments are issuing bonds at an accelerated pace\" with a higher proportion of these funds raised going to fund infrastructure. MS expects additional measures to support growth should the downside risks to economic activity intensify in the coming weeks.</li></ul>",

Moreover, China took a barrage of measures, including lowering rates on its 7- and 14-day reverse repos by 10bps each, in an attempt to cushion losses in the markets amid expectations for a tumultuous session. USD/CNY was propelled at the onshore open as the pair breached 7.00 to the upside (vs. 6.9364 close on Jan 23rd) and eclipsed its 100 DMA at 7.0223 before closing around 7.0250 – the weakest close since December 12th, USD/CNH remains comfortably above 7.00. Subsequently, DXY gained and resides above 97.500 (vs. 97.429 open and low) with the index supported amid weakness in some peers. DXY sees its 200 DMA around 97.720 and 100 DMA at 97.832 ahead of the psychological 98.000 – with traders eyeing the ISM Manufacturing release for influence, whilst the Iowa caucus will also be followed to give a lens into the Democratic presidential candidate.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The marked G10 underperformer as traders anticipate the PM Johnson speech (1100 GMT) to set out a hard stance regarding post-Brexit trade negotiations with the EU – with one of the pledges being to not align the UK with the EU alongside the willingness to leave on WTO terms if needed. Meanwhile, EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator (1000 GMT) is expected to warn that an FTA is unlikely should the UK misalign itself with EU standards. GBP/USD saw some support around 1.3100, having retreated from Friday’s 1.3200 close and with limited reaction seen by the UK manufacturing PMI being revised higher to neutral from mild a contraction. Should 1.3100 convincingly break, technicians could be eyeing 1.3080 (Friday’s low) and 1.3075 (50 DMA) for potential support.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, JPY, EUR</strong></p><p>All softer vs. the Buck as DXY gains traction. Antipodeans were supported in overnight trade but have since trimmed gains and reside around flat territory – AUD/USD briefly topped 0.6700 before reversing and finding mild support around 0.6680, whilst its Kiwi counterpart fell back below its 100 DMA (0.6466) having reached an overnight high of 0.6476 and with 0.6450 seen as psychological support. Similarly, the safe-haven currencies succumb to the firmer Dollar, with USD/JPY meandering around 108.50 ahead of its 100 DMA at 108.75. EUR/USD was largely unreactive to a modest revision higher in the EZ manufacturing PMI, which also came with an optimistic accompanying statement from the IHS, noting that economy could see growth strengthen in the period ahead. EUR/USD trades just above the 1.1050 mark (vs. high 1.1095) with the pair eyeing EUR 927mln of options expiring around 1.1075 at today’s NY cut.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Mild reprieve across the EM-sphere, but potentially more-so consolidation following last-week’s hefty losses. TRY saw little reaction as the country’s real rates were dragged further into negative territory amid the uptick in January YY inflation – with participants noting that this may prompt a pause in the CBRT’s easing cycle, although not a cessation given the Turkish President’s pledge to bring rates back to single digits this year. USD/TRY remains flat intraday around 5.9850. Meanwhile, USD/ZAR has retreated back below 15.000 with some noting a correction from last week’s losses alongside profit taking.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets mostly trade with heavy losses as markets braced themselves for China’s return from the Lunar New Year holiday in which mainland bourses opened with losses of nearly 9% and several Shanghai commodity prices hit limit down, despite efforts by China to cushion the blow. ASX 200 (-1.2%) is lower with energy and mining sectors underperforming in the broad weakness across Australia sectors aside from the gold miners which are underpinned by recent safe-haven plays, while Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) is subdued but off its lows after finding mild relief from currency flows. Elsewhere, a blood bath was seen at the reopen of the Shanghai Comp. (-8.1%) as it played catch up to the global market rout brought on by the coronavirus and with sentiment not helped by a contraction in Industrial Profits, although mainland bourses are slightly off their worst levels and the Hang Seng (-0.4%) briefly recovered into positive territory after several supportive measures including PBoC’s CNY 1.2tln reverse repo operation in which the central bank also lowered repo rates by 10bps.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY nurses some of Friday’s data-driven losses and re-approaches the 97.50 level, as it benefits from mild weakness across its major counterparts including EUR/USD which marginally pulls back from resistance just shy of 1.1100 and with GBP/USD back below the 1.3200 handle post-Brexit. Furthermore, there were also reports that UK PM Johnson is to say there is \"no need\" to accept various EU rules in a trade deal, as well as news of ‘terror related’ stabbings in London which did no favours for GBP. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses attempt to nurse Friday’s losses with the former testing 108.50 albeit with the rebound capped by the broad risk aversion and antipodeans are lacklustre ahead of tomorrow’s RBA decision and amid a weaker CNY which depreciated past 7.0000 against the greenback.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are steady above the 153.00 level as they hold on to recent gains amid the rout in stocks and after the BoJ kept February purchase intentions mostly inline with the previous month.</p>",
