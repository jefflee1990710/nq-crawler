Major curve spreads were boased towards steepening, with 5s30s +6bps as traders wrapped up for the day. Today's auction of 5s was average, which by the standards of Tuesday's 2s auction means it was reasonable; the sale tailed, and saw the lowest yield at a 5s auction since September 2016. Tomorrow the US will sell 7s; the 7s sector trades cheap in asset swap versus older 7s, SocGen's analysts observe, though trades fair on the fly against 5s and 10s. SocGen thinks the auction will be expensive on an outright basis, given the WI is trading below all stop-out rates since 2013. The bank notes that the 2s7s curve has flattened meaningfully this year, and that has seen 7s richen on the curve. SocGen says it has a negative bias ahead of the auction.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX -0.38% at 3116, NDQ +0.44% at 8874, DJIA -0.46% at 26,958.</strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: Disney (DIS) was offered after an earlier than expected departure of its CEO Bob Iger, to be replaced by Bob Chapek.

Speakers: Fed’s Mester, Evans; ECB’s Lagarde, Lane, de Guindos, Schnabel, Panetta; BoE’s Carney, Cunliffe. Auctions: US 7-year Note; US 2, 5, 7 and 2-year FRN Announcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP:</strong> It has been a choppy session, with price action dictated by coronavirus headlines, and while the growth of new cases in China is slowing, confirmed cases outside of the world's second largest economy are growing, as is the number of countries seeing cases. The spread in Europe injected risk-off in the early part of the European day, and those losses were on the cusp of paring as US players were getting to their desks, with a notably positive cash equity open in NY; there was also a decent batch of new homes sales data out of the US, as well as signs Germany's fiscal authorities are loosening the strings. However, as more headlines continued to come out of the US about suspected cases, the mood soured, and stocks meandered between red and green through the late part of the session. Additionally, participants continue to note the uncertainties around the Democrat Presidential nominee. The VIX is off extremes seen in Tuesday above 30, though remains almost double the level versus last week. Naturally, havens have been in vogue amid the risk-off, with gold adding over ten bucks, though remains off the highs above USD 1690 seen last week. After market, traders will be watching the press conference with US President Trump and CDC officials, who will be discussing the coronavirus; reports suggest Trump wants to reiterate an upbeat message, given stocks have been slammed of late, and Trump has even gone as far of accusing some news outlets of deliberate fear-mongering to drive equity downside. Trump is due at 18:30 EST.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19: </strong>US President Trump will be holding a news conference at the White House on coronavirus, which will be attended by CDC representatives, and others; the presser is set to get underway at 1830 EST / 2330 GMT. Trump also took aim at the media, accusing MSNBC and CNN of overreacting to the coronavirus threat with the intention of spooking markets. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed an USD 8.5bln fund to combat the coronavirus, having previously stating that US President Trump's USD 2.5bln request was not sufficient; Schumer acknowledged that Congress approved USD 7bln during the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. In the US, an additional risk off-tone swept markets on reports that 83 individuals in Nassau County, Long Island are being observed for the virus – however, was the news was somewhat offset by NY Governor Cuomo announcing that all 27 possible cases in NYC explored had come back negative. Meanwhile, France reported its first citizen to die from the virus, while several European nations have now announced their first cases of the virus; Austria, Croatia, Greece and Switzerland have all said cases involved people who had been to Italy, BBC reported, as did Algeria in Africa, and Brazil, the first LatAm nation to record a case. The first positive virus test has been recorded in Latin America, after a Brazilian citizen returned from Italy. In Germany, a health official said the nation was at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic and infection chains in Germany could no longer be tracked, adding that hospitals and employers should review their \"pandemic\" planning (note, the WHO does not classify the outbreak as a pandemic yet).</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES (FEB): </strong>It was a solid report, with the annualised pace of new home sales rising to 764k, topping the consensus 710k, and the prior 708k. Inventory also tightened to 5.1 months' worth (from 5.5 months), to the lowest since November 2017. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the sales likely are likely to correct to the downside in February, but the trend has further to rise. \"Homebuilders are not keeping pace with demand growth, so inventory is trending downwards, and price gains will rise as inventory falls, though the 14.0% Y/Y jump in January massively overstates the trend; the data are not adjusted for changes in the mix of homes sold each month, either by size or location, so the numbers are wild even over periods of a few months.\"</p><p><strong>* FISCAL STIMULUS: </strong>German finmin Scholz announced the temporary suspension of the country’s so-called black zero rule, which requires Germany to keep its budget balanced. The measure will give ~German regional governments more flexibility in going over budget. The ECB President welcomed the news, although some German lawmakers, perhaps unsurprisingly, took umbrage with the development.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB President Lagarde generally stayed away from any fresh comments on monetary policy or the strategic review, or the ECB's reaction function to the coronavirus. She noted that reports that Germany was mulling fiscal measures intended to support the economy were welcome, particularly in the current situation. The ECB's Irish representative Makhlouf said it was too early to come to a view on what the ECB should be doing about the coronavirus; elsewhere, he said central banks needed to do a better job at communicating and explaining their policies, noting that there continues to be uncertainty about exactly what the ECB's \"close to, but below\" inflation language means. Makhlouf said the ECB had to avoid target shortfalls leading to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations from its target and has to consider whether the current consumer price index is helping to communicate the ECB's objectives in the most effective way. On the strategic review, Makhlouf said that some believe it was going to be challenging to complete it this year. ECB's Holzmann said he expects the ECB will stick to its 2% inflation target in the review.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 1.17 LOWER USD 48.73/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 1.45 LOWER AT USD 52.81/BBL:</strong> The crude complex’s decline continued Wednesday, failing to enjoy the same magnitude of gains made in equities earlier in the session. Moreover, when equities started paring gains amid “pandemic” talk from Germany, oil was offered just as hard, with another leg lower on reports of a potential outbreak in Long Island, US. A modestly bullish EIA inventory report did little to move the dial either, crude stocks built by 0.5mln (exp. +2mln, smaller than the private reported +1.3mln), the products both drew by over 2mln (deeper than expectations), while net crude imports fell by 0.4mln BPD, although crude production remained elevated at 13.0mln BPD. Elsewhere, a fire and explosion broke out at Marathon Petroleum’s (MPC) Carson, California refinery (360k BPD), although had since been contained with supply only partially turned off. Libyan oil production rose fractionally to 136k BPD on February 25th from 122k BPD on February 23rd.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 133-10+.</strong> The coronavirus' spreads set the tone for risk markets, and while the direction was meandering in early trade, ultimately, yields are lower across the curve at settlement, with fresh record lows seen for 10-year yields, while 30s matched Tuesday's low. Major curve spreads were boased towards steepening, with 5s30s +6bps as traders wrapped up for the day. Today's auction of 5s was average, which by the standards of Tuesday's 2s auction means it was reasonable; the sale tailed, and saw the lowest yield at a 5s auction since September 2016. Tomorrow the US will sell 7s; the 7s sector trades cheap in asset swap versus older 7s, SocGen's analysts observe, though trades fair on the fly against 5s and 10s. SocGen thinks the auction will be expensive on an outright basis, given the WI is trading below all stop-out rates since 2013. The bank notes that the 2s7s curve has flattened meaningfully this year, and that has seen 7s richen on the curve. SocGen says it has a negative bias ahead of the auction.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.38% at 3116, NDQ +0.44% at 8874, DJIA -0.46% at 26,958.</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -2.96%, Utilities -0.96%, Real Estate -0.88%, Industrials -0.79%, Cons Disc -0.68%, Financials -0.67%, Cons Stpl -0.48%, Materials -0.34%, Communication Svs -0.19%, Health -0.1%, Technology +0.4%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Disney (DIS)<strong> </strong>was offered after an earlier than expected departure of its CEO Bob Iger, to be replaced by Bob Chapek. TJX Companies (TJX) surged on the open after a stellar earnings report and guidance, including a dividend raise and share buybacks. Salesforce (CRM) had a decent earnings report too but opened lower following co-CEO Keith Block’s departure announcement. Tesla (TSLA) was hit following reports it was cutting back battery production with Panasonic. Lowe’s (LOW) sold off on disappointing sales and guidance. Other stocks that traded firmer after earnings included J. M. Smucker (SJM), Public Storage (PSA), Moderna (MRNA). Meanwhile, stocks that ultimately sold-off post earnings report included Public Service Enterprise (PEG), Amarin (AMRN), Caesars (CZR), Exelixis (EXEL), Insulet (PODD), Jazz Pharma (JAZZ), Papa John’s (PZZA), Planet Fitness (PLNT), SmileDirectClub (SDC), Toll Brothers (TOL), Wendy’s (WEN) and WW Int. (WW). Beyond Meat (BYND) was bid as Starbucks (SBUX) Canada will soon launch one of its breakfast sandwiches. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) tumbled lower after providing a virus-related profit warning, weighing on competitors too (NGLH, CCL). Click <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23956/download\">here</a> for Thursday’s earnings estimates.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong>&nbsp; It is a mixed picture in FX, with major FX pairs little changed, although the bias is clearly towards lower activity-related currencies (AUD, NZD, SEK), haven currencies higher (USD a touch higher, JPY is stable, XAU is higher).&nbsp; The EUR has endured a choppy session, though news out of Germany that it has suspended its black zero goal has provided a minor positive in an otherwise sour session. EURCHF, however, is higher, amid fresh warnings from SNB officials about the willingness to intervene. The pound is lower on Brexit headlines, while month-end demand was also said to be supporting EURUSD. EMFX is feeling the pressure of risk-off, while commodity FX is taking its cue from lower crude prices.</p>",

Elsewhere, a fire and explosion broke out at Marathon Petroleum’s (MPC) Carson, California refinery (360k BPD), although had since been contained with supply only partially turned off.

        "content": "<ul><li>OVERVIEW: 16 out of 26 economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank of Korea to lower rates by 25bps to a record low of 1.00% (marking the third cut in its easing cycle), while 10 respondents see the Central Bank holding rates at 1.25%; 20 out of 26 analysts see a 25bps reduction by May.</li><li>EVOLUTION OF EXPECTATIONS: Calls for easing were largely bolstered amid the coronavirus outbreak, as economic prospects for the trade-reliant country faces hurdles in light of supply disruptions and dampened global demand. In January, only 20% of the economists polled at the time expected a February rate reduction, provided the upbeat Central Bank statement at the January meeting - due to easing trade tensions between US and China coupled with a then resilient domestic environment.</li><li>DATA: Early February trade data showed a significant decline in Chinese demand as the spill-over from the virus outbreak in China started to materialise on South Korean export figures. Furthermore, the fourth-largest Asian economy grew at 2.0% in 2019, the slowest pace in 10-years, which came despite two rates cuts and a significant increase to the country’s budget. Moreover, domestic demand has cooled in February, reflected by the latest Consumer Sentiment data which fell from 104.2 to 96.9 – marking the lowest reading in six months and the sharpest fall since mid-2015.</li><li>GOVERNMENT MEASURES: The South Korean government has taken measures to stem the spread of the virus domestically following the mammoth rise in cases over the weekend, which prompted Seoul to raise its virus alert level to the “highest”. President Moon has also called on the government to draft a supplementary budget as soon as possible, whilst also implementing a containment policy on the largest infected area, Daegu. The country has also delayed the start of school by a week, whilst also urging citizens to avoid densely populated congregations. BoK Governor Lee held an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the impact of the virus outbreak, albeit there were no signals of any planned policy action.</li><li>RATE ANNOUNCEMENT TWEAKS: The coronavirus outbreak has also changed the way the Central Bank will deliver its rate decision on Thursday. The decision, typically announced by an official, will instead be delivered via a text message and email amid precaution for the safety of the press, according to a statement by the Bank. Further, the live presser will instead be streamed on Facebook and YouTube with only representatives of the press permitted to attend the live event. At the Q&amp;A, journalists and other reporters will have to submit questions in advance via their smartphones.</li></ul>",

They might be more inclined to purchase in the 2y sector.\" SocGen says that the flight-to-quality has richened the 5-year sector extensively on an outright basis, which might further suppress demand. Meanwhile, it notes that the current WI for the 5 is well below the stop-yields of all auctions since September 2016. With that said, the bank reminds us that demand for the 5-year sector in repo might marginally support demand for the auction. SocGen says it is negative on Wednesday's 5-year auction.</li></ul><p><strong>5-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 1.448%, six-auction average 1.554%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 1.1bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.33x, six-auction avg. 2.42x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 26.1%, six-auction avg. 23.4%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 13.9%, six-auction avg. 14.7%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 60.0%, six-auction avg. 61.9%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is now firmer vs all major counterparts, albeit to varying degrees, as the <strong>DXY</strong> regains a foothold on the 99.000 handle amidst a rebound in US Treasury yields and curve re-steepening. However, broad risk sentiment remains shaky on breaking coronavirus headlines/news ahead of Fed speeches that might, but probably won’t underpin 2020 easing expectations, especially hot on the heels of stronger than expected new home sales data.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling has been under pressure for the most part after failing to build on Tuesday’s recovery gains much beyond 1.3000 and 0.8350 vs the Buck and Euro respectively. Heightened hard Brexit risk remains a persistent weight for the Pound as the UK and EU show faint sign of compromising or relaxing divergent trade terms, but the retreat in Cable towards 1.2900 and rebound in Eur/Gbp over 0.8430 at one stage appeared more to do with bearish month end and seasonal factors (normal cross buying along with touted selling by US corps). Similarly, the Aussie extended overnight losses against its US and NZ peers on the back of ongoing Chinese nCoV and contagion concerns, not to mention a significantly bigger drop in Q4 construction work completed than anticipated. Aud/Usd is just holding off new 11 year lows circa 0.6550 and Aud/Nzd is hovering near the bottom end of a 1.0456-13 range, as the Kiwi keeps tabs on 0.6300 in the run up to NZ trade data for January.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Some respite for the petro-currencies as oil prices stabilise, with the Loonie still resisting attempts to breach the psychological 1.3300 mark convincingly and Norwegian Krona paring losses between 10.2300+/10.1650+ parameters to stand on a more even keel with Eur/Sek within a 10.5950-5650 band following indirectly supportive Swedish Crown remarks from Riksbank Governor Ingves.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The so called safe-havens and halfway house have gradually lost momentum and appeal against the backdrop of improving risk appetite or less aversion surrounding the rising total and widening spread of China’s health epidemic, as the Yen recoils from another test of offers/supply into 111.00, Franc reverses through 0.9750 and Euro fails to sustain a knee-jerk rally above 1.0900 made on reports about Germany planning to suspend its debt brake to provide financial aid to local governments.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Rouble also gleaned some comfort from Brent’s partial revival, but Rand relief was perhaps more difficult to fathom or rationalise in wake of a SA budget that had only a few obviously positive elements like cost saving measures and fiscal injections for Eskom and SAA vs a 3 year plan to cut wages that riled COSATU, but may appease Moody’s on balance. Elsewhere, the Lira is still erring on the side of caution amidst Turkish-Russian talks to try and resolve the Syrian Idlib conflict and the Real suffered a bout of post-Brazilian carnival blues via corrective losses on return from the festivities and 2 day break.</p>",

Over in China, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.7%)</strong> was weighed on by losses across its oil giants, entertainment stocks and financials – which together account for almost 70% of the index, although the index pared some losses upon the unveiling of the Hong Kong budget, which announced a HKD 120bln package of measures to bolster the economy.<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%)</strong> opened lower by over 1% but thereafter trimmed losses despite the PBoC skipping OMO for a 7th consecutive day, after the latest China virus numbers showed a slowing rate of new cases and deaths.</p><p><strong>Hong Kong government unveiled measures worth HKD 120bln in its annual budget to bolster the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak and after months of social unrest.</strong> Hong Kong Government is to hand out HKD 10k to each permanent citizen aged 18 or older.

The velocity of the selling pressure in Europe has been noteworthy with interim support levels proving to be futile (e.g. FTSE MIB has now entered correction territory from last week’s highs). That said, ahead of the US entrance to market, indices have nursed some losses as markets paused for breath following recent selling. In terms of the case count, reporting for the purposes of a written report is particularly difficult given the fluidity of the situation (as such we will refer you to the headline feed of the website), however, from a European perspective, Italy is continuing to announce further coronavirus diagnosis’, France has announced two deaths, Spain’s case tally continues to rise, Britain has stepped up preventative measures, Poland and Greece have announced their first cases. Again, this is just a small snapshot of where we currently stand and the situation is consistently evolving on an hour-by hour basis. Losses are relatively broad-based across sectors with defensive names unable to insulate themselves from the selling pressure. Notable specific laggards include, LSE (-2.7%) with Co. shares have been weighed on by FT reports that the Co.’s purchase of Refinitiv is facing increasing scrutiny by the EU, whilst travel names once again are a source of heavy underperformance with TUI (-2.1%), easyJet (-2.3%), RyanAir (-4.3%). Furthermore, corporate updates in the UK from Metro Bank (-17%) and Taylor Wimpey (-3.5%) have been poorly received with the latter hampering some of its UK peers.

However, the Aussie is underperforming in outright terms following much weaker than forecast construction data overnight, as Aud/Usd falls to fresh decade+ lows circa 0.6570 in contrast to a more resilient Kiwi clinging to 0.6300 ahead of NZ trade later. Another decline in crude has undermined the Loonie and Norwegian Crown, with Usd/Cad hovering just shy of 1.3300 and Eur/Nok up to 10.2300 at one stage, while the Swedish Crown is keeping its head afloat of 10.6000 vs the single currency after more Riksbank attempts to downplay weak inflation and Sek itself.</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Buck remains prone to more pronounced demand for safer-havens and soft US Treasury yields, but the DXY is holding around 99.000 by virtue of bigger net advances vs the more high-beta, risk or cyclical currencies ahead of housing metrics.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Aside from the overall negative tone, the Lira awaits news from Turkey’s first meeting with Russia on Syria to see if positive sentiments from the latter about finding an Idlib solution come to fruition, while the Rand is eagerly eyeing the SA budget at noon and Mexican Peso more macro news in the form of retail sales.</p><p><strong>South African Public Sector Union Nehawu says if ministers announce wage freezing, we will mobilise all our members to shut down the government indefinitely</strong>.

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>All off best levels, but retaining a firm underlying bid as broad sentiment remains bearish on the ongoing spread and accumulation of COVID-19 cases/deaths further beyond mainland China. The Franc is probing above 0.9750 against a relatively depressed Dollar, though unwinding some gains vs a perkier Euro that has breached Fib resistance against the Greenback around 1.0887 and tested 1.0900, while reclaiming big figures at 1.0600 and 0.8400 in Eur/Chf and Eur/Gbp cross terms. Note, market contacts suggest the latter may have rebounded on month end factors and the usual RHS demand, while Eur/Usd could have derived some upside impetus from option expiries skewed towards the top of a 1.0850-1.0900 range (1.8 bn at the base, 1.2 bn from 1.0860-70 and 2.5 bn between 1.0890-1.0900). Elsewhere, the Yen has been meandering within 110.57-14 parameters and mindful of comments from Japanese PM Abe underlining a watching brief on nCoV and market moves in response to unfolding developments, while Gold has settled down after another bout of heavy selling to straddle Usd1650/oz again.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Pound has lost traction partly due to Eur/Gbp positioning for Friday, while Cable has retreated from 1.3000+ peaks amidst speculation of seasonal US selling on top of Brexit uncertainty that is hampering Sterling before UK-EU trade talks begin. However, the Aussie is underperforming in outright terms following much weaker than forecast construction data overnight, as Aud/Usd falls to fresh decade+ lows circa 0.6570 in contrast to a more resilient Kiwi clinging to 0.6300 ahead of NZ trade later. Another decline in crude has undermined the Loonie and Norwegian Crown, with Usd/Cad hovering just shy of 1.3300 and Eur/Nok up to 10.2300 at one stage, while the Swedish Crown is keeping its head afloat of 10.6000 vs the single currency after more Riksbank attempts to downplay weak inflation and Sek itself.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck remains prone to more pronounced demand for safer-havens and soft US Treasury yields, but the <strong>DXY</strong> is holding around 99.000 by virtue of bigger net advances vs the more high-beta, risk or cyclical currencies ahead of housing metrics.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Aside from the overall negative tone, the Lira awaits news from Turkey’s first meeting with Russia on Syria to see if positive sentiments from the latter about finding an Idlib solution come to fruition, while the Rand is eagerly eyeing the SA budget at noon and Mexican Peso more macro news in the form of retail sales.</p>",

As such, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> traded relatively flat throughout most of the session, although the former saw modest downside as Spain reported a cumulative seven coronavirus cases within 24 hours, with the pair around 1.0875 for a large part of overnight trade. Technicians will be eyeing 1.0900 to the upside followed by their pair’s 21 DMA ~1.0915, whilst to the downside, the 10 DMA ~1.0835 could offer mild support should 1.0850 fail to hold. Meanwhile, <strong>Cable</strong> flatlined around the 1.3000 psychological level before seeing modest weakness towards the latter part of the session. Levels highlighted to the upside include its 200 WMA (1.3025) 50 DMA (1.3032) and potential resistance ~1.3050, a psychological level which coincides with the pair’s Feb 18 high.

The bid in the T-Note caught traction as US participants came to the scene, following on from the Europe session where the Bund dropped beneath the -0.50% level for the first time this year, meanwhile later in the session the US 10-year yield briefly printed all time record lows. Typical haven flows into Treasuries were observed as equities treaded lower, the Treasury supply this week in the front-to-belly doesn’t appear to be dissuading investors either, where markets continue to price in further chances of FOMC cuts this year. The 2-year auction on the outset could be considered weak, tailing by 1.6bps, covering below its six-auction average and dealers taking a significant cut of the takedown. Although more widely, the 2-year Note, as the rest of the curve, has been on a big rally this week, where auction participants could perceive valuations as rich in the near term ahead of more concrete data from COVID-19.

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Global stock rout carries on as virus fears further materialise ",
        "content": "<p>Asian equities trade with losses across the board as the global stock rout continues, and after Wall Street experienced another bleak session which saw the DJIA shed almost 900 points, whilst the S&amp;P posted is largest two-day loss since August 2015 and the Nasdaq turned negative for the year - traders were also spooked by the 10yr Treasury yield falling to a fresh record low of ~1.3070%, which came as a function of the rising virus fears. ASX 200 (-2.1%) continues to be pressured by its heavyweight financials and mining sectors, whilst Nikkei 225 (-1.9%) bears the brunt of declines in across mining and auto names, but Canon shares rose some 4% at the open on the back of reports that the Co. has started developing a coronavirus testing kit. KOSPI (-1.7%) conforms to the regional declines following its breather session yesterday, as confirmed South Korean cases topped 1000 vs. 51 a week ago. Over in China, Hang Seng (-1.4%) is weighed on by losses across its oil giants, entertainment stocks and financials – which together account for just under 70% of the index. Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) opened lower by over 1% but has since trimmed losses despite the PBoC skipping OMO for a 7th consecutive day, as the latest China virus numbers showed a slowing rate of new cases and deaths.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY trades withing a narrow intraday band on either side of 99.000 having tracked US yields lower in the prior session on virus jitters. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD trade flat, although the former seeing modest downside as Spain reported a cumulative seven coronavirus cases within 24 hours, with the pair around 1.0875 for a large part of overnight trade. Technicians will be eyeing 1.0900 to the upside followed by their pair’s 21 DMA ~1.0915, whilst to the downside, the 10 DMA ~1.0835 could offer mild support should 1.0850 fail to hold. Meanwhile, Cable remains sideways around the 1.3000 psychological level ahead of its 200 WMA (1.3025) 50 DMA (1.3032) and potential resistance ~1.3050, a psychological level which coincides with the pair’s Feb 18 high. Elsewhere, antipodeans are pressured against the backdrop of rising virus cases in the region – AUD/USD traded on either side of 0.6600 with little initial reaction to dismal Aussie Construction Work Done data, whilst the Kiwi remains north of 0.6300 – although both pairs experienced modest downside as South Korean cases topped 1000. KRW experienced renewed weakness at the open, USD/KRW rose from ~1215 and stopped short of 1220 ahead of the BoK rate decision tomorrow, where market expectations are tilted towards a 25bps cut to record low rates. Finally, USD/JPY holds onto its 110.00 handle and largely track US equity futures as opposed to the overall risk sentiment.</p>",
