Phillips 66 (PSX) opened higher after beating EPS estimates. Chipmakers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) traded lower after Goldman commented cautiously on them due to a lower forecast in DRAM and NAND pricing. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT) nosedived following a miss on top and bottom line estimates. Qorvo (QRVO) opened lower after it gave pessimistic guidance. Arconic (ARNC) drifted lower through the day on the announcement of the co. splitting into two and despite reporting strong earnings. Electronic Arts (EA). SPX +0.1% at 2708, NASDAQ +0.1% at 7299, DJI +0.3% at 25104.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the movement in the T-Note was sideways on Friday, with a slight upward bias, inspired by the usual cocktail of lingering concerns over US/China trade, and global growth. A brief dip in the pre-market was attributed to dealers unloading auction long positions, while Bunds were providing some influence in early trade too. Profit-taking at the end of the European day saw some of the gains pared back to leave the T-Note 3 ticks higher at settlement. Major curve spreads were mixed, but generally +/- 1bps at settle. US T-note futures (H9) settled +3 ticks at 122-12.</p>\r\n",
