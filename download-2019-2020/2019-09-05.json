The semiconductor space largely benefitted from positive China trade updates which saw the SOX outperform sub-indices. Western Digital (WDC) also released a new 5TB portable hard drive today for a retail price of USD 79.99. Netflix (NFLX) opened lower, but clawed back losses throughout the session, following unconfirmed reports that its September quarter will be light on international shortfall.

Elsewhere, Macy’s (M) announced it is to implement a cost reduction strategy where it is to reduce annual costs by USD 400-500mln and improve working capital by roughly USD 100mln over 2-4 years.

Most of the move came after the headline ISM printed a rebound to 56.4, easing concerns of the less rosy manufacturing figure. It was another busy day of corporate dollar issuance, with IFR noting an expectation of 14 different issuers set to price on the day, making the week one of the largest on record for issuance, with investment grade issuance pricing USD 74bln worth, and a multi-year record amount. By settlement yields were higher across the curve, with the 5-year yield and 7-year yield being most pronounced, rising approximately 12bps. US T-note (Z9) settled 31+ ticks lower at 131-09+.</p>",

Fed’s Powell; ECB’s De Guindos; BoE’s Ramsden; SNB’s Jordan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP:</strong> Risk sentiment has been supported after news that US/China key negotiators are set to meet in early October for face-to-face talks, and exacerbated by a strong US ISM non-manufacturing release; all contributed to diminishing pricing of a 50bps cut at the FOMC meeting in a few weeks. In FX, the bid in safe havens eased, while commodity currencies rallied, as did oil, with WTI topping its 100 dma. The Treasury curve bear-steepened in the earlier session, with 10-year yields rising back towards 1.60% (the level core PCE Y/Y currently is at) again, but the front-end did catch up later. Equities firmed lead by Financials, Industrials and Communications. Risk-friendly trading has also been supported by signs that authorities are attempting to ease tensions in Hong Kong; in the UK, the prospects of a messy no deal Brexit appear to be diminishing; while political risks in Italy are also abating. US jobs report tomorrow will likely see a trend-rate pace of payroll additions, while next week's ECB meeting is expected to deliver stimulus (whether it is big enough to satisfy the market remains to be seen), while the incoming ECB chief Lagarde yesterday called on European governments to provide fiscal support to the economy, saying that monpol is not the only game in town.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> <strong>* US/CHINA:</strong>&nbsp;Face-to-face trade talks between the two nations are set to be held in Washington in early October (no specific date was provided), after a phone call between US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Vice Premier Liu He; USTR Lighthizer, China Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, PBOC's Governor Yi Gang, China NBS' Ning Jizhe were also on the call. However, reports suggests both sides are sceptical as to the progress that can be made; the US reportedly does not believe China will commit to the reforms demanded, which led to talks breaking down in May; and China said that while the phone call went well, it was not considering withdrawing its WTO complaint against the US. The news follows reports this week that both sides were struggling to set a date for September talks, in a sign of the animosity between the two. The US is set to raise some tariffs on Chinese goods on 1st October, and then again on 15th December. China's MOFCOM has said mandarins will hold discussions this month to prepare for the October meetings. Elsewhere, a Fed research paper cited by WSJ suggested that trade uncertainty is likely to cut US growth by more than 1% through early 2020.</p><p><strong>* US JULY NON-MANUFACTURING ISM:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike its manufacturing equivalent, it was an upside beat for the non-manufacturing ISM. The headline rebounded to 56.4 from 53.7, rising sharply above the expected 54.0. Capital Economics has taken it as a sign that the US economy is hanging in there, even though the manufacturing sector specifically is in recession. Nevertheless, the consultancy notes that the weighted average of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices is still only at a level consistent with GDP growth of slightly less than 2.0% annualised, which is about the pace implied by its GDP trackers for third-quarter growth. Looking at the breakdown, CapEco notes that the new orders and business activity indices both rebounded sharply, but the employment index fell further to 53.1, from 56.2. \"At that level, the employment index is consistent with monthly service sector payroll gains of 125,000, which is well below the 184,000 gain reported in the ADP survey,\" adding that, overall, \"there is still only limited evidence of the global manufacturing weakness spilling over into domestic services.<strong>*</strong></p><p><strong>* US JULY ADP:</strong> The August ADP employment report bodes well for the BLS NFP headline (released tomorrow) after an upside surprise, printing 195k against 148k expected. The strength within the survey was broad, and researchers noted that the August data was the first time in the last 12 months that we have seen balanced job growth across small, medium and large-sized companies. Moody's economist Mark Zandi said, \"Businesses are holding firm on their payrolls despite the slowing economy; hiring has moderated, but layoffs remain low,\" adding that \"as long as this continues, US recession will remain at bay.\"</p><p><strong>* US NFP PREVIEW:&nbsp;</strong>Although analysts look for an above-trend 160k nonfarm payrolls to be added to the US economy in August, indicators are mixed: On the one hand, ADP’s gauge of payrolls surprised to the upside; however, Challenger job cuts ticked higher, and the employment sub-indices within the ISM surveys also declined (though remain expansionary). Consumer confidence data showed the differential between jobs ‘plentiful’ and ‘jobs hard to get’ rising, auguring well for the NFP data, but the outlook on the labour market was less positive, while consumers are also becoming less optimistic about the prospects for wage growth.

However, key US ally, and regional player Israel has warned against the move, and has called for further pressure to be applied on Iran, not eased.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLED USD 0.04 HIGHER AT USD 56.30/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLED USD 0.25 HIGHER AT USD 60.95: </strong>Crude futures rose in harmony with risk appetite on the announcement that the US and China would be having face-to-face talks, placing a slightly bearish API report in the back seat from the earlier session, although prices pared back into settlement despite a lack of downside catalysts. The EIA release showed crude stocks drawing 4.8mln bbls, contrary to the API-reported build of 0.4mln and deeper than the expected draw of 2.5mln; both the products drew greater than expected, gasoline at 2.4mln and distillates at 2.5mln; Cushing posted another draw, albeit less pronounced at 0.23mln bbls. Elsewhere in the report, production fell by 100k BPD to 12.4mln, refinery utilisation fell greater than expected at -0.4%, whilst net imports had an increase due to a rise in imports, rather than a fall in exports.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG:</strong>&nbsp;Wednesday's move to withdraw a controversial extradition bill, which sparked three-months of protests, is unlikely to put an end to protests, some analysts have warned, pointing out that this meets only one of the protestors' five demands, and as expected, pro-democracy protestors overnight pushed for further concessions, which China has already ruled-out (the full list of demands are: 1) the extradition bill must be withdrawn; 2) chief executive Lam must resign; 3) the government must retract its characterisation of the violent clashes as \"riots\"; 4) there must be a full independent inquiry into the actions of the police; 5) everyone arrested in respect of the clashes must be unconditionally freed.) Some have suggested that attempts to appease protestors come ahead of the PRC's 70th Anniversary on 1st October, a period which Chinese authorities want free of protests. Note, the Hang Seng overnight traded lower, amid broader strength in APAC equities after 'positive' developments on the US/China trade front.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK lawmakers passed the third reading of the bill to delay the Brexit with 327 votes in favour vs. 299 against, while UK PM Johnson's bid to call an election was also defeated with 298 votes in favour vs. 56 against which fell short of the two-thirds majority or 434 votes required for a snap election. Contrary to prior expectations that Johnson allies within the House of Lords would attempt a “marathon” filibuster, the government has said a bill to stop a no-deal Brexit will complete its passage through the Lords by 17:00 BST on Friday. The final version of the bill is then expected to return to the Lower House for ratification on Monday, where it is again expected to pass, after which PM Johnson is expected to table another general election vote. Due to the fact that Labour are firmly opposed to agreeing to any election before the Brexit bill is written into law, it seems unlikely that any vote to hold a general election under the fixed term parliament act (which requires 2/3 of MPs to vote in favour) will win before the bill passes the house of Lords. Therefore, Johnson may look for alternative routes to secure an election. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-uk-elections-probably-on-the-way-05-09-2019\">Click here for full analysis</a>.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK:</strong> Riksbank left rates unchanged, as expected, at -0.25%. However, the Bank defied expectations by maintaining its guidance for the rate to be raised towards the end of the year, or the beginning of next year; although, it did acknowledge that lower foreign rates, and the expectation that it will remain low for a long period of time, means the increase will occur at a slower pace than previously forecast. Guidance, as reflected by the repo rate forecasts, sees significantly less hikes across the forecast horizon; 2022’s Q3 rate, for instance, is seen at 0.37% from the prior 0.90%. The retention of the near-term hawkish guidance caused immediate appreciation in the SEK, as such EUR/SEK dropped from around 10.74 going into the release to a low of 10.6560. On the data front, the Bank acknowledged that GDP has slowed somewhat, while sentiment has worsened due to the trade conflict between US and China, in-fitting with their comments of proceeding cautiously with monetary policy. Nordea notes that the limited revisions to GDP forecasts (1.5% vs. 1.6% in July for 2020) and the Bank maintaining their description of Sweden’s economy as strong is too optimistic a line to take. Additionally, while it acknowledges that its call for a December cut is in question, a rate cut remains a possibility and upcoming data prints particularly inflation readings are now very much in focus. It’s also worth noting that this meeting was Deputy Governor af Jochnick’s last meeting, as the decision at the meeting was unanimous it does not appear as if her departure will affect near term policy (regarded as dovish and roughly in-line with Governor Ingves’ stance), though more clarity on this may arise from the minutes due on September 17th.</p><p><strong>* BOC’S SCHEMBRI:</strong> Deputy Governor Schembri reiterated the BOC statement from Wednesday, saying current accommodation in monetary policy remains appropriate without mentioning any cuts in the future. On inflation, Schembri said that with it at around 2%, it supports the hypothesis of the economy’s output gap as essentially closed. Schembri also highlighted the resilient Canadian economy. The BOC’s statement gained some attention in that it made no mention of monitoring commodity prices, although Schembri pushed back on this, saying the bank was paying close attention to commodity price declines.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 31+ TICKS LOWER AT 131-09+: </strong>Treasuries sold-off on the improved risk appetite (face-to-face China talks and strong US ISM non-manufacturing), lending a hand to the financials sector. Most of the move came after the headline ISM printed a rebound to 56.4, easing concerns of the less rosy manufacturing figure. It was another busy day of corporate dollar issuance, with IFR noting an expectation of 14 different issuers set to price on the day, making the week one of the largest on record for issuance, with investment grade issuance pricing USD 74bln worth, and a multi-year record amount. By settlement yields were higher across the curve, with the 5-year yield and 7-year yield being most pronounced, rising approximately 12bps.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1.3% AT 2976, NASDAQ-100 1.9% AT 7863, DOW JONES 1.4% AT 26728, S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 1.9%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; -0.7%, Energy&nbsp; 1.3%, Financials&nbsp; 1.9%, Health Care&nbsp; 1%, Industrials&nbsp; 1.8%, Information Technology&nbsp; 2.1%, Materials&nbsp; 0.2%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.6%, Utilities&nbsp; -1.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The semiconductor space largely benefitted from positive China trade updates which saw the SOX outperform sub-indices. Western Digital (WDC) also released a new 5TB portable hard drive today for a retail price of USD 79.99. Netflix (NFLX) opened lower, but clawed back losses throughout the session, following unconfirmed reports that its September quarter will be light on international shortfall. Church &amp; Dwight (CHD) traded lower as Spruce Point Capital announced a strong sell position on the company. Elsewhere, Macy’s (M) announced it is to implement a cost reduction strategy where it is to reduce annual costs by USD 400-500mln and improve working capital by roughly USD 100mln over 2-4 years. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Comcast (CMCSA) both benefitted from upgrades at Stephens and Oppenheimer, respectively. General Electric (GE) was initiated with an Equal Weight at MS and a PT of USD 10/shr.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>USD </strong>A stronger than forecast ADP tally on the eve of NFP and a much more upbeat ISM services survey compared to the manufacturing version appear to have stopped the rot for the Dollar that was losing more ground amidst rising risk appetite following reports of constructive conversations between top US and Chinese trade officials that set the stage for further talks later this month and potentially face-to-face meetings in early October. The DXY was hurtling towards 98.000, but has subsequently rebounded to the middle of a 98.538-079 range, and technically needs to close above 98.464 (50% Fib) to signal a short term base.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> Ahead of the 70th Anniversary of the PRC on 1st October, SocGen asks if authorities will strengthen the yuan; the anniversary, the bank says, muddies the waters for the actively managed yuan, and could outweigh the headlines on US/China trade. Separately, SocGen notes that the China/US 10-year yield spread has widened out to 155bp, and is closing in on the of 172bp seen in November 2017. The bank says that in a free-floating currency regime, this would be an incentive to turn bullish on the yuan. With regards to CNY bonds, JPM's recent inclusion of China bonds in its GBI-EM benchmark (in February 2020) is providing support to the complex. It is worth keeping in mind Wednesday's reports out of china, that RRR adjustments may be on the way.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Risks of a no deal Brexit have diminished, and PM Johnson's defeats in Parliament have been opportunities for shorts to be squeezed out of GBP. The question, therefore, is how sustainable is the GBP bounce? Positioning is extreme, though at extreme levels, may provide support (where are the fresh shorts going to come from?). However, the spectre of elections complicates the matter, and keeps downside risks on the table; will PM Johnson ignore Parliament's request to seek an A50 extension? Would Johnson repeal this week's legislation in the event he wins elections, reintroducing the prospect of no deal? ING's analysts recall the GBP price action from earlier in the year, when the pound strengthened first on the hopes of the A50 extension (as is happening now) but then saw downside as it became clear lawmakers are fragmented on the eventual course of Brexit, and risks of no deal returned; this playbook, ING says, could provide the blueprint.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> The Aussie's recent rise looks fragile, Westpac's analysts say. Trade data in Q2 helped Australia to avoid flat/negative growth in Q2, however, does not see much cheer elsewhere, noting that the pace of growth has fallen to the slowest since the GFC. Westpac is not very encouraged by indicators of growth drivers, either, noting hat private demand is contraction, consumer spending is also weak, while business investment is falling, and construction has not recovered. There may be hope on consumption, when tax cuts filter into the consumer sector, and infrastructure activity is also seen picking up. However, Westpac says it is also implied that there has not been much progress in lowering Aussie joblessness. \"So when the RBA repeats that it is prepared to 'ease monetary policy further if needed', it is surely just a question of exactly when the next rate cut is delivered,\" the bank writes, \"our base case remains October, but we can see why pricing is 50/50 for Oct and 100% by Nov.\" Westpac adds that \"the RBA's wary optimism, GDP data and more positive headlines on US-China trade helped AUD lead the G10 over the past week,\" but \"it would be surprising if it can keep top spot in the week ahead.\"</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The Real has been subject to external forces in recent weeks (US/China, uncertainty about global manufacturing, as well as spill overs from Argentina). UBS thinks it has deviated from equilibrium levels, and projects appreciation in the coming months, as reforms advance in Congress and GDP growth accelerates. The bank sees USDBRL at 3.90 in three-months (prev. forecast 3.90), and 3.80 in six-months and 12 months (both prev 3.70).</p><p><strong>* XAU</strong> Technicians note that the break above USD 1550 on Wednesday was key, and could augur moves up to USD 1568, USD 1586 (61.8% fib from the 2011 retracement). Today's more constructive headlines for risk has seen the yellow metal stall at USD 1555, and then ultimately sink back towards USD 1500. Immediately, key support levels at USD 1477, USD 1486, and USD 1517. A key indicator to watch is real rates, RBC suggests, and the bank attributes much of XAU's upside to declining real rates -- with around USD 17trln of debt with negative yields -- driven by recession fears.</p><p><strong>* JPY/CHF </strong>USDJPY<strong> </strong>traded higher given the flight out of quality following positive China trade updates and strong ISM non-manufacturing data; yield differentiations may have also played a part amid rising US yields in a risk on environment. The pair breached the 107 handle to the upside seeing highs of 107.22, highest since late July, before paring back throughout the tail end of the session to the 107 handle at pixel time. Technicians note 107.46/49 fib retracement levels as ones to look out for if tomorrows job report is strong. <strong>CHF</strong> traded very similar to JPY given the safe haven outflows and the Franc was unphased by SNB’s Jordan similar rhetoric who stated he can't say how long negative rates will last, but they are necessary for now and added interest rate spreads play an important role for exchange rates.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>USDCAD traded in a tight range of 1.3246-1.3192 following yesterdays less dovish BoC rate decision that positioning had expected and strong US data adding strength to the greenback being the driver of todays price action. BoC’s Schembri did little to move the Loonie as he stuck to yesterday’s rate decision script but even in tight ranges the pair found support around the 50dma; 1.3189. Goldman Sachs note that following the less dovish than expected message from the central bank, USDCAD is miss priced here and should be 100pips lower.</p><p><strong>* ZAR/TRY:</strong> Both EMFX currencies handed back a chunk of their recent gains today as South Africa’s current account deficit deepened by ~ZAR 60bln and the Lira pressured by dovish rhetoric from Turkish President Erdogan.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>A stronger than forecast ADP tally on the eve of NFP and a much more upbeat ISM services survey compared to the manufacturing version appear to have stopped the rot for the Dollar that was losing more ground amidst rising risk appetite following reports of constructive conversations between top US and Chinese trade officials that set the stage for further talks later this month and potentially face-to-face meetings in early October. The <strong>DXY </strong>was hurtling towards 98.000, but has subsequently rebounded to the middle of a 98.538-079 range, and technically needs to close above 98.464 (50% Fib) to signal a short term base.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/EUR/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling has gradually built up a head of steam to surpass the high-flying Swedish Krona, and after Cable crossed 1.2300 on a mixture of perceived declining no deal Brexit danger/shorter remain odds and short covering, stops were tripped on a break of 1.2310 all the way up to 1.2350. Similarly, Eur/Gbp continued its retreat to just shy of 0.8950 before Pound buying petered out and the single currency gathered momentum to trigger buy orders said to be sitting at 1.1050. The Euro then tested chart resistance around 1.1066 and after a few attempts extended gains to circa 1.1084, but no further given the aforementioned Buck bounce. Back to Scandinavia, and a relatively hawkish Riksbank that remains on course to hike the repo to zero around the turn of the year pushed Eur/Sek down to within a whisker of 10.6600 and the 100 DMA that sits just below, while the Norwegian Crown also outperformed against the risk supportive backdrop and firmer oil prices with Eur/Nok probing 9.9250 at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/CHF/JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>Almost a clear and clean divide between high-beta currencies and the safer-havens given the heightened risk appetite noted above, as the Aussie and Kiwi consolidate gains above 0.6800 and 0.6350 respectively vs their US rival in contrast to the Franc, Yen and Gold that are all on the retreat from recent peaks against the Greenback. Indeed, Usd/Chf rebounded towards 0.9875 awaiting SNB’s Jordan, Usd/Jpy rallied through 107.00 and Xau/Usd reversed to just shy of 1510 compared to a fresh multi-year high of 1555+ only yesterday. However, the Loonie has petered out despite the rebound in crude, with Usd/Cad nearer the top of 1.3245-1.3190 parameters ahead of comments from BoC’s Schembri that could be more dovish that the post-meeting policy statement on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Far from heroes to zeroes, but the Rand and Lira both handed back a chunk of their recent gains on dovish rhetoric from Turkish President Erdogan and downbeat SA fiscal data.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: UK elections (probably) on the way",
        "content": "<p><strong>THE LATEST:</strong> UK lawmakers passed the third reading of the bill to delay the Brexit with 327 votes in favour vs. 299 against, while UK PM Johnson's bid to call an election was also defeated with 298 votes in favour vs. 56 against which fell short of the two-thirds majority or 434 votes required for a snap election. Contrary to prior expectations that Johnson allies within the House of Lords would attempt a “marathon” filibuster, the government has said a bill to stop a no-deal Brexit will complete its passage through the Lords by 17:00 BST on Friday. The final version of the bill is then expected to return to the Lower House for ratification on Monday, where it is again expected to pass, after which PM Johnson is expected to table another general election vote. Due to the fact that Labour are firmly opposed to agreeing to any election before the Brexit bill is written into law, it seems unlikely that any vote to hold a general election under the fixed term parliament act (which requires 2/3 of MPs to vote in favour) will win before the bill passes the house of Lords. Therefore, Johnson may look for alternative routes to secure an election.</p><p><strong>ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO AN ELECTION: </strong>Johnson could attempt to pass a one-line bill along the lines of “Notwithstanding the FTPA, we will hold a general election on (insert) date”. Although this bill would only require a simple majority, it would be an amendable motion so could contain many binding elements that the PM wouldn’t want. Alternatively, Johnson could attempt to repeal the Fixed Term Parliament Act by a simple majority, however, this would likely be unpopular with the opposition as it hands all the power back to the PM on when to hold elections. Another route the PM could take may be to call a no confidence vote in himself; although, again, the opposition would likely not bite, with Labour Leader Corbyn already vowing not to fall into any “traps” of agreeing to an election before the Brexit bill has been written into law.</p><p><strong>A GENERAL ELECTION, WHEN RATHER THAN IF: </strong>ING argue that, just because Johnson failed to secure an election last night does not mean one is not imminent; the opposition Labour Party have signalled that once the Brexit bill passes the Lords, gains royal assent and is written into law, they would consent to one. After a meeting of Labour MPs yesterday, almost all were reportedly in favour of an election after October 31, which would hand PM Johnson a major defeat by forcing him to break his “Brexit on the 31 October, do or die” pledge and ask the EU for an extension. ING note that, while the Conservatives are likely to frame this as the latest instance of parliament standing in the way of the will of the people, Labour appear to believe this would leave Johnson in a weaker position heading into the polls.</p><p><strong>NO DEAL RISK IS LOWER, BUT NOT GONE: </strong>Should the Brexit bill become law, the risk of a potential ‘no deal’ on 31 October is undoubtedly lower. However, ING present a number of reasons why it is too early to assume no deal risk is gone. Firstly, if an election occurs on 15 October and the Conservatives win a majority, there is nothing to stop them reversing the law that requires them to ask for another Article 50 extension. Secondly, if a 'no deal' exit is averted in October, it could still happen at a future point in time. If the Conservatives were able to secure a majority at an election after the 31 October, government may well press ahead and try to leave the EU without a deal should negotiations with the EU fail. Moreover, if the PM is forced to ask for an A50 extension, the EU is not obliged say ‘yes’. EU27 leaders have indicated that they only wish to grant another extension for a precise purpose, such as an election. Moreover, the UK’s Brexit Minister Barclay said a delay to Brexit requires the approval of every member state, including the UK, hypothetically giving PM Johnson the right to veto an extension request.</p><p><strong>HOW COULD AN ELECTION GO DOWN:</strong> Based on the latest YouGov polling, Conservatives sit as roughly 35%, which crudely translates into a majority given the struggles of main opposition Labour Party, who poll at a 25%, under the UK’s first past the post system. Although the Conservatives may be able to make up some ground in Labour-held leave voting areas, the party may well come under pressure in Scotland from the SNP and the Liberal Democrats in Southern parts of the UK. ING think that the PM’s messaging on ‘no deal’ will also be important; if the Conservatives campaign too hard on ‘no deal’, they risk losing moderate voters, however, take to-nuanced a view on ‘no deal’ and they may be vulnerable to the Brexit party.</p><p><strong>STERLING – THE RALLY IS UNLIKELY TO CONTINUE: </strong>ING take the view that the outlook for the pound will largely depend on who wins a general election (if one happens). Sterling has been on the front foot in recent days, at the hands of the success of anti-no deal MPs in legislating against 'no-deal' and the potentially stretched short GBP positioning. But with early elections looming, ING expect the pound to soon re-start its weakening trend, given election uncertainty and the risk of a resurgence of 'no-deal' risk should the Conservative party win a majority under Johnson. ING remind us that earlier in the year Sterling had strengthened on hopes of an Article 50 extension (as is happening now) but eventually depreciated as UK politics became more fragmented and the risk of a no-deal Brexit increased. The banks sees a similar roadmap playing out this time and target EURGBP at 0.95 and GBPUSD at 1.17 in the coming months. Based on the bank’s sterling risk premium tracker, around 2% of short-term risk premia is priced into GBP at this point vs 5% in August, suggesting more downside to GBP once election uncertainty kicks in.</p>",

Furthermore, expectations of PBoC easing after China’s Cabinet announced it will implement RRR reductions ‘in time’ have added to the optimism, although the advances in Hong Kong were restricted considering its benchmark had already surged just shy of 1000 points or a near-4% gain yesterday due to the extradition bill withdrawal.

Moreover, the projected repo path was lowered and the Riksbank reiterated the need to proceed with caution. Nevertheless, Eur/Sek has tested support below 10.7000 in the form of the 100 DMA on relative policy outlooks given that the ECB is widely tipped to unleash more stimulus next week.</p><p><strong>NOK/NZD/AUD/CAD/GBP</strong></p><p>Although Statistics Norway believes rates have peaked, the Norges Bank retains guidance for a further 25 bp tightening by the end of the year, and Eur/Nok is also retreating further from recent peaks amidst a broad upturn in risk sentiment with the cross eyeing 9.9250. Elsewhere, the Kiwi and Aussie are also buoyed by reports that the US and China are planning to hold trade talks in early October, while the Loonie is extending its post-BoC gains (less dovish than expected stance) through 1.3200. However, the Antipodean Dollars have switched places as Nzd/Usd builds a firmer base above 0.6350 and Aud/Usd is capped around 0.6825 with the Aud/Nzd cross topping out just above 1.0700 accordingly, perhaps in response to overnight Australian trade data revealing a moderately narrower than forecast surplus. Note also, decent option expiries between 0.6790-0.6800 may be hampering the Aussie. Meanwhile, a generally softer Greenback (<strong>DXY </strong>just off another new recent low, at 98.253, and under a key 50% Fib level of 98.464) alongside manoeuvres in Westminster to block a no deal Brexit continue to prop up the Pound, with Cable nudging above 1.2300 and Eur/Gbp back down under 0.9000 even though the single currency is outpacing the Buck as well.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Euro edges further above 1.1000 to test offer and option expiry interest at 1.1050 where 1.6 bn resides, but the Yen and Franc lose a bit more safe-haven appeal on the aforementioned improvement in market morale, with Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf pivoting 106.50 and 0.9825 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some loss of recovery momentum for the Lira ahead of next Thursday’s CBRT rate verdict as Turkish President Erdogan contends that more cuts are coming, while the Rand’s bull run has been somewhat hampered by worse than expected SA Q2 current account metrics. Usd/Try has bounced from circa 5.6500 and Usd/Zar is firmer after a temporary dip below 14.7500, but the PBoC set its Usd/Cny reference rate a smidge lower against the recent trend.</p>",

        "content": "<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nomura note the rebound in global equities last night, which rallied on a confluence of positive developments including a de-escalation of tensions in Hong Kong and a perceived reduction in the risk of a no deal Brexit and then extended gains overnight on the news that the US and China had set up face-to-face talks in October. Looked at from a broader perspective, the bank argues, global equities continue to rock back and forth between optimism and pessimism on an almost daily basis, indicative that the majority of speculators still appear unable to discern a clear direction in the market.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of this, Nomura note, is that ultra-short-term investors, who are defined by having short investment time horizons of up to 10 working days and tend to be quick to react as they aim to sniff out the next market Trend, have a relatively neutral exposure to all the major asset classes, as tracked by the tracked by the SG Short Term Traders Index (NEIXSTTI). The bank argues that the fact that these highly agile investors are watching from the sidelines implies that it is hard to take any sort of action in the current environment.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focusing more on Asian equity indices; the bank raises the possibility that the lessening of political risks in Hong Kong and global macro hedge funds' buying of Asian equities could lead to a reversal of the bearish trades in Chinese and Hong Kong equities that built up this summer. However, the bank notes that CTAs, which look to have driven these trades, have already made good progress in covering their short positions in Hang Seng futures and judging from the current macroeconomic environment, it appears premature to expect CTAs to not only roll back their short positions on Hong Kong equity but also turn long. Rather, Nomura argues, should Chinese manufacturing momentum remain weak, it thinks CTAs and other traders like them are likely to shift direction again toward rebuilding their short positions sooner or later.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of specific levels; the bank estimates the breakeven for CTAs' existing shorts (the cost of net selling since July) at around 26,500 for the Hang Seng, around 10,300 for H-shares and around 20,900 for the Nikkei 225, making a systematic unwinding by CTAs likely. However, the bank reiterates it argument that given the correlation between these positions and economic momentum, it looks likely to be increasingly difficult for momentum-chasers to justify a further reduction in short positions based on the current Chinese economic conditions.</p>",

However, Gilts have subsequently reversed again and are now hovering just above a new 133.35 intraday low alongside STIR contracts that have remained mostly soft from the off between flat and 3.5 ticks adrift. In terms of drivers, Brexit and the fate of the UK Government remains up in the air, but overall risk appetite has been boosted by reports that high level talks have been held on the US-China trade front with a face-to-face meeting pencilled in for early next month, while the Swedish Riksbank has retained its near term tightening bias and DMO supply looms after a speech from Brexit Minister Barclay and ahead of BoE’s Tenreyro.</p>",

However, the 10 year benchmark remains below par and off early Eurex highs (175.76 compared to yesterday’s 175.71 close) amidst another leg up in global risk sentiment on latest US-China trade reports that look constructive if not conclusive in terms of striking an accord any time soon. Ahead, heavy issuance schedule, potential ECB speak and a busy US data agenda.</p>",

(Newswires)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> was lacklustre below the 98.50 level after the prior day’s losses partly due to the recent dovish Fed rhetoric including Fed’s Williams who is ready to act as appropriate to support the economy and after Fed’s Kaplan warned of distortions and challenges if the Fed stays where it is above the treasury curve. Meanwhile, the greenback’s major counterparts held on to most their recent gains with <strong>EUR/USD</strong> above 1.1000 as Italy prepares to swear in its new 5SM-PD coalition government today and with <strong>GBP/USD</strong> taking a breather from recent outperformance at the mid-1.2200 handle after PM Johnson and his ‘do-or-die’ Brexit agenda suffered a double setback in Parliament in which lawmakers passed the first stage of the Brexit delay bill and as the PM’s motion for an election failed to meet the two-thirds majority needed. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> was boosted by the risk appetite and <strong>CAD</strong> remained firm after a less dovish than hoped BoC meeting where rates were kept unchanged as expected and there was no mention of future policy moves, while antipodeans were also lifted with <strong>AUD/USD</strong> back above 0.6800 due to the US-China trade hopes, stronger PBoC reference rate and its high beta properties.</p><p>Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(Jul) 7268M vs. Exp. 7400.0M (Prev. 8036.0M, Rev. 7977M).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices retreated back below the USD 1550/oz level with the precious metal weighed by the lack of safe-haven demand and <strong>copper</strong> extended on gains spurred by the broad rally across stocks.&nbsp;</p><p>API Crude Inventories: +0.401mln vs. Exp. -2.5mln (Prev. -11.1mln).

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said slow wage growth means the US is not at full employment and that he does not see evidence of overheating in the US economy, while he added tariffs as well as the trade war is leading to nervousness and sees greater downside risks globally which will end up slowing the US. Kashkari also suggested the Fed shouldn't tap brakes on the US economy until we see inflation and that odds of a full-blown financial crisis are less likely but noted that even in an ordinary recession the fed has little room to cut rates.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board as region takes impetus from the upside in global peers after dovish Fed rhetoric and positive developments in Hong Kong in which the extradition bill was fully withdrawn, while US-China trade hopes have exacerbated the gains after the sides agreed to hold talks in Washington early next month. ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.2%) are boosted by the trade developments and with the energy sector frontrunning the gains in Australia due to the recent advances in oil prices, while exporter names in Tokyo benefit from a weaker currency. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) conform to the heightened risk appetite after the phone call between China’s Vice Premier Liu He with US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer in which the sides also agreed on trade consultations mid-September ahead of next month’s talks and will take action to create good conditions for the consultations. Furthermore, expectations of PBoC easing after China’s Cabinet announced it will implement RRR reductions ‘in time’ have added to the optimism, although the advances in Hong Kong are restricted considering its benchmark had already surged just shy of 1000 points or a near-4% gain yesterday due to the extradition bill withdrawal.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains lacklustre below the 98.50 level after the prior day’s losses partly due to the recent dovish Fed rhetoric including Fed’s Williams who is ready to act as appropriate to support the economy and after Fed’s Kaplan warned of distortions and challenges if the Fed stays where it is above the treasury curve. Meanwhile, the greenback’s major counterparts have held on to their gains with EUR/USD above 1.1000 as Italy prepares to swear in its new M5S-PD coalition government today and with GBP/USD taking a breather from recent outperformance at the mid-1.2200 handle after PM Johnson and his ‘do-or-die’ Brexit agenda suffered a double setback in Parliament in which lawmakers passed the first stage of the Brexit delay bill and as the PM’s motion for an election failed to meet the two-thirds majority needed. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is boosted by the risk appetite and CAD holds firm after a less dovish than hoped BoC meeting where rates were kept unchanged as expected and there was no mention of future policy moves, while antipodeans are lifted with AUD/USD back above 0.6800 due to the US-China trade hopes, stronger PBoC reference rate and its high beta properties.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs slipped below the 155.00 level amid pressure across global bond futures triggered by the US-China trade talk announcement, while focus now shifts to a 30yr JGB auction later.&nbsp;</p>",
