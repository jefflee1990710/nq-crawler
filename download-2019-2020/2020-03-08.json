The market’s attention has now drifted to the energy complex’s decline on Friday as the OPEC meeting failed to bear fruit, in addition to another rally in the TPLEX, both reflective in the Energy and Financials sectors leading the losses. A blockbuster NFP report failed to draw attention as COVID-19 rides in the front seat. Desks note that the cascade lower in oil prices and Treasury yields brings a whole new bearish factor for equity investors to consider. The lower energy prices, post-OPEC failing to reach an agreement for additional cuts or even an extension, brings strain to companies in the sector, particularly to the debt-laden shale names in the US. As E&amp;P names struggle further, credit lines begin to deteriorate, raising the risks of defaults and for wider effects on the credit markets. Furthermore, with yields tumbling lower and lower, banks come increasingly strained to turn profits, raising the risk of a contraction of credit available to the economy (Fed cuts should theoretically ease these pressures), which could pose wider risks to supply chains, keeping investors cautious on equities; the lower energy prices aren’t providing any favours either as bond investors lower their inflation expectations. SPX -1.7% at 2972, NDX -1.63% at 8530, DJI -0.98% at 25,865.</p><p>The TPLEX bull-flattened intensely on Friday, bringing the 30-year yield to unseen territory – where it currently lies within the Fed’s target range, while the rest of the curve sits beneath it. No one “reason” supported the price movement, but desks note ongoing haven flows amid the virus from real money buyers, flows from convexity buyers, and chunky short-covering from leveraged accounts, in addition to an unwinding of market hedges. Furthermore, investors are likely piling into duration ahead of the weekend, where participants again dare expose themselves to risk in the face of COVID-19 and an expected rise in US cases. The sharp decline in energy prices served as the cherry on the cake as investors begin pricing in lower inflation expectations and question the stability of the global economy, increasing the allure of the sovereign bond market. By settlement, yields had fallen 9bps in the 2-year yield, 19.5bps in the 10-year yield and a jaw-dropping 33bps in the 30-year yield. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point &amp; 9 ticks higher at 138-01+.</p>",
