The stock helped in a turnaround from yesterday’s poor retail earnings from Macy’s (M) which hit the retail sector heavily as it underperformed on Wednesday. Agilent Technologies (A) and NetApp (NTAP) were also higher on strong earnings. Cisco (CSCO) however, beat on EPS and Revenues but it had a weak forecast and sales in China fell 25% and that the country's state-owned enterprises were no longer taking bids from Cisco and added that impending US tariffs and Chinese customers shunning its gear were weighing on its business.

Today's price action has been attributed to continued concerns on global trade, and economic growth cooling. However, the Treasury complex also moved higher with Bunds (where yields continue to find fresh lows), on reports Oli Rehn was calling for big easing at the next policy meeting. Back to the Fed, in wake of the solid 0830am data, there was some lightening of rate cut pricing, however, as the narrative returned to risk-off, money markets resumed pricing a 45% chance of a double rate cut in September. Looking ahead, around 114bps of easing is priced through the end of 2020, which is up slightly vs the end of last week. US T-note futures (U9) settled 14 ticks higher at 130-30+.</p>",

Of Michigan.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Pre-market earnings from Walmart and Alibaba were solid, and helped engineer a rebound in risk conditions. The move was lent further support from a solid retail sales and Philly Fed/Empire State surveys. However, the moves were faded, and Treasuries found fresh buyers, pushing 10-year yields to fresh three-year lows, while yields at the long-end of the curve fell to fresh record lows. Fears of recession, global growth slowdown, and tensions between the US and China have kept risk assets on the defensive, and have increased the appeal of US Treasuries, particularly given that they still offer positive yields. However, in FX, risk sentiment has clearly been mixed, with USDJPY rising despite lower yields and lower equities, while the Swissy is also negative. Gold, however, is up on the day, firmer to the tune of around half-a-percent. EMFX is rallying, although the MXN lags after Banxico fired a surprise, but not altogether unexpected rate cut. Crude is on the back foot, which was attributed to overall risk sentiment, which impacts the demand side, while this week's inventory builds have also been cited.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:&nbsp;</strong>China's Finance Ministry said China will take countermeasures after the US will implement additional tariffs on some Chinese imports in September, stating that the US actions violated the consensus reached at the Osaka G20 meeting between Trump and Xi. Later, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry expressed hope that the US can meet China 'halfway' on trade issues; analysts are sceptical that this could happen, given that USTR Lighthizer and trade advisor Navarro have in recent times suggested such a compromise could not be struck, due to the egregiousness of China's past violation. Trump later waded in himself, echoing that sentiment. Meanwhile, the hawkish Global Times Editor said China has full confidence to fight a prolonged battle with US, the US economy does not appear as strong as Trump has said, and that trade war and Hong Kong riots have hit US' positive image in China, while Chinese society is more united politically and can afford a long-term fight.</p><p><strong>* ECB:&nbsp;</strong>ECB's Rehn said the central bank needs to launch a significant and impactful easing package in September, arguing that it is better to overshoot rather than undershoot on stimulus, and that easing methods should include a combination of rate cuts and substantial bond purchases. His comments helped EGBs to rally (Bund and BTPs hit fresh contract highs in wake of his comments) while EUR fell to fresh lows slightly below 1.11. Prior to the ECB's last policy meeting, Rehn had said that further monetary stimulus was needed until there was an improvement in economic and inflation prospects, if the central bank is to meet its mandate; he also said that the slowdown was no longer temporary. Market pricing for a 20bps rate cut at the ECB's September meeting rose to around 55% in wake of Rehn's interview; it had been around 45% in the European morning.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Bullard (Voter)</strong> said in an interview that there is no need for any inter-meeting action by the Fed (pushing back on some speculation that Fed may rush out to provide accommodation in the face of flight to safety flows). The St. Louis Fed President said he would not prejudge the September meeting, but is closely watching the TIPs breakeven rate that is showing low inflation expectations and is currently not high enough for him; adding that he wants to hit the inflation target (2%) and does not mind going above it. Talking about the yield curve inversion, Bullard said it has to be sustained for him to consider it as the harbinger of a recession, saying he will wait and see how it develops. Bullard said that some of the recent market downturn may be overdone given the US' data, citing the strong labour market and consumer segment with reasonable growth, he also notes European and Asian weakness, but caveats that the market is still overall very high. After Bullard’s interview, <strong>White House Trade Advisor Navarro</strong> said he thought Bullard virtually guaranteed a rate cut at the next meeting, something that is expected anyway based on market pricing.</p><p><strong>* US PHILLY/EMPIRE FED MANUFACTURING:&nbsp;</strong>Both the Philly Fed and Empire Fed manufacturing surveys came in better than expected. The former fell to 16.8 from 21.8 (the consensus was for 10.0), while the Empire Fed survey rose to 4.8 from 4.3 (consensus was for 2.0). It was encouraging that the forward-looking new orders components rose for both, as well. \"These numbers are potentially quite significant, because the survey forms were sent to businesses at the start of the month, just as the president was threatening to impose new tariffs on China,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"we therefore expected a repeat of the June performance, when the threat of tariffs on Mexico triggered steep declines in both the Philly and Empire State indexes.\" Pantheon notes that this time around, it seems either that firms did not believe Trump would make good his threat, after all, he abandoned the Mexico tariff threat after just eight days - either that, or that underlying conditions are stabilizing. \"That's consistent with the message from China's PMIs, though not yet the official output data,\" the consultancy writes, \"still, both the Philly and Empire State now point clearly to a rebound in the national ISM index. With that said, the Philly Fed has overstated the ISM in recent months, but the Empire State has been more reliable, and the message from its July components is that the ISM should rise to about 54, from 51.2 in July, Pantheon reckons. \"That seems to be asking a lot, given the turmoil in the markets, and we still need to see the Richmond Fed and Chicago PMI surveys before we finalize our forecast. Still, for now the manufacturing freefall story is not supported by today’s surveys.\"</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES:&nbsp;</strong>Retail sales saw a rise of 0.7% M/M, beating expectations for 0.3%, and rising from June's 0.3% (revised lower from 0.4%). The headline print was boosted from a rise in gasoline sales and core sales led by further strength in online and food sales. Spending momentum continued to improve, as the Y/Y data showed a solid 3.4%, and the core rate accelerated to 4.8% Y/Y, above the average 2018 pace. Oxford Economics notes that following the upbeat data, Q3 real consumer spending looks to be running around 3.0% (vs its previous forecast of 2.4%) which would likely push their real GDP growth estimate close to 2.0% (versus its previous view of around 1.7%). OxEco states this report shows some reprieve from rising downside risks and weaker global growth and it provides some reassurance that a sharp downturn isn’t around the corner.</p><p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION:&nbsp;</strong>Industrial Production fell 0.2% in July, missing expectations for a rise of 0.1%. The poor reading was slightly offset by a 0.2% upward revision to the prior from a flat reading. However, the manufacturing data was more eye-catching, falling by 0.4%, deeper than the 0.1% fall analysts had expected. Wells Fargo notes that both manufacturing and mining are in a declining trend so far in 2019 and the headwinds from the trade war and global slowdown also weighing. It also states that \"the trend decline in commodity prices may be weighing on activity in the mining sector. Production at the country’s mines slowed 1.8%, the biggest monthly drop in three years and also the fifth monthly decline in the first seven months of the year.\"</p><p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> Bull-steepening was the order of the day, with the 2s30s spread widening by around 4bps, and 2s10s rising by around 3bps, moving out of inversion. 10-year yields found fresh three-year lows, while the 30-year yield printed fresh record lows. Today's price action has been attributed to continued concerns on global trade, and economic growth cooling. However, the Treasury complex also moved higher with Bunds (where yields continue to find fresh lows), on reports Oli Rehn was calling for big easing at the next policy meeting. Back to the Fed, in wake of the solid 0830am data, there was some lightening of rate cut pricing, however, as the narrative returned to risk-off, money markets resumed pricing a 45% chance of a double rate cut in September. Looking ahead, around 114bps of easing is priced through the end of 2020, which is up slightly vs the end of last week.</p><p><strong>* NORGES BANK:&nbsp;</strong>Rates were left unchanged, as expected, at 1.25%. The focus was on whether the Bank retained its intention to lift rates again in 2019, after the Governor had previously said September might be an opportune moment to hike. However, there was no explicit mention about a September move. EURNOK initially moved higher after the decision, as participants reacted to the lack of a reference to an immediate move on rates. But the majority of the move was pared as the central bank reiterated it will most likely hike at some point this year, with meetings in September, October and December in the focus, as it keeps its options open, though a September move is judged as perhaps too early after the caution the NB expressed in this release. On the domestic front, Norges Bank stated that the upturn is continuing broadly as forecast, though inflation has been somewhat lower than expected (with the caveat that a weaker Krone may contribute to higher inflation ahead). Explicit mention was given to the uncertainty around Brexit, and increasing trade tensions; notably, no reference to recent dovish activity by any Central Banks was made. Finally, the Norwegian Central Bank said the rate outlook is little changed since June's meeting, but the global risk outlook is more uncertain ahead; as such, analysts at ING posit that a December hike seems reasonable, though will likely depend on the US-China trade war, and global growth concerns.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>Rates were cut by 25bps to 8.00%, which analysts did float as a risk, despite the consensus looking for an unchanged decision. The Board was not unanimous in its decision; one member voted to hold rates. The Banxico said balance of risks for growth is still tilted to the downside, and that upwards risks to inflation comes from pressure to the MXN from internal and external factors, as well as US tariffs. The central bank also stated that if the economy requires an adjustment in the real exchange rate, Banxico will help this to happen in an orderly manner, to avoid second round effects. It noted that inflation expectations have remained stable above 3.0%, and elsewhere said that it was important to deal with the sovereign rating of Mexico, as well as that of Pemex.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Gibraltar has released the Iranian tanker Grace 1 following the country’s decision to not extend the vessel’s detention order, where the it had been seized since July 4th. Prior to the announcement it was reported that the US had applied to seize the tanker, a move that will have severed tensions between Tehran and Washington, although ultimately the ship was released, but Iranian officials later made comments against the US’ attempts.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLED USD 0.76 LOWER AT USD 54.47/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLED USD 1.25 LOWER AT USD 58.23/BBL: </strong>Back-and-forth risk appetite spurred by comments from both the US and China has seen crude markets take their cues from overall risk sentiment, trading choppy through the session. China announcing it would retaliate to the US’ latest tariffs saw benchmark prices take a tumble, before paring back on later comments that China hopes the US would “meet it halfway” in talks, however, energy markets reversed course again after US President Trump reiterated that the US would not meet China halfway. Given the day’s price action, global demand and macro sentiment is clearly still the driving force for oil. Elsewhere catching headlines was the release of the Iranian Grace 1 tanker by Gibraltar, although not without effort from the US to seize it for themselves. It is worth highlighting that WTI option expiry is likely to have been factor of Thursday’s tape action as a result of book squaring. NOTE: The OPEC MOMR will be released on Friday.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.3% AT 2848, NASDAQ 100 -0.7% AT 7485, DOW JONES 0.4% AT 25579. S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.1%, Consumer Staples 1.5%, Energy -0.5%, Financials 0.3%, Health Care 0.4%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology -0.2%, Materials 0%, Telecommunication Services 0.5%, Utilities 1.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Walmart’s (WMT) stellar earnings not only boosted the stock but also aided in turning sentiment around pre-market, the retail giant beat on both top and bottom lines, comparable same store sales also beat street expectations and it also raised its FY operating income and EPS view. The stock helped in a turnaround from yesterday’s poor retail earnings from Macy’s (M) which hit the retail sector heavily as it underperformed on Wednesday. Agilent Technologies (A) and NetApp (NTAP) were also higher on strong earnings. Cisco (CSCO) however, beat on EPS and Revenues but it had a weak forecast and sales in China fell 25% and that the country's state-owned enterprises were no longer taking bids from Cisco and added that impending US tariffs and Chinese customers shunning its gear were weighing on its business. Tapestry (TPR) EPS and revenues fell in line with expectations, however, the name was hit as it narrowed its FY EPS view below expectations and that Kate Spade sales were lower than company expectations. General Electric (GE) was lower after Harry Markopolos said that the companies accounting is a new target of his as he states problems amount to USD 38bln, or 40% of conglomerates market value”.</p>",

Today's price action has been attributed to continued concerns on global trade, and economic growth cooling. However, the Treasury complex also moved higher with Bunds (where yields continue to find fresh lows), on reports Oli Rehn was calling for big easing at the next policy meeting. Back to the Fed, in wake of the solid 0830am data, there was some lightening of rate cut pricing, however, as the narrative returned to risk-off, money markets resumed pricing a 45% chance of a double rate cut in September. Looking ahead, around 114bps of easing is priced through the end of 2020, which is up slightly vs the end of last week.</li></ul>",

Given the day’s price action, global demand and macro sentiment is clearly still the driving force for oil. Elsewhere catching headlines was the release of the Iranian Grace 1 tanker by Gibraltar, although not without effort from the US to seize it for themselves. It is worth highlighting that WTI option expiry is likely to have been factor of Thursday’s tape action as a result of book squaring. NOTE: The OPEC MOMR will be released on Friday.</li></ul>",

Eur/Usd retreated through 1.1100 as a result and breached another Fib support on the way at 1.1112, with the <strong>DXY</strong> independently bid after a run of upbeat US data/surveys, and bears are now eyeing 1.1070 (August 2nd low) ahead of the 2019 base at 1.1027 seen just the day before.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Dollar got a boost from early US macro releases in the form of retail sales, Empire State and Philly Fed indices that all beat forecasts if not previous prints.

However, aversion abated and began to turn around again when headlines reported that China hopes that the US meets halfway in negotiations before the pendulum swung back on a response from President Trump stressing that any deal must be on US terms.

Elsewhere, the promise of intervention has helped the Real pare some losses from 4.0500+ towards 4.0000, and Usd/Ars has backed off from 60.0000+ with daily ops to stem the Peso’s losses and despite opposition candidate and front-runner after primaries, Fernandez claiming that 60.0000 is appropriate.</p>",

China announcing it would retaliate to the US’ latest tariffs saw benchmark prices take a tumble, before paring back on later comments that China hopes the US would “meet it halfway” in talks, however, energy markets reversed course again after US President Trump reiterated Trade Advisor Navarro’s stance that the US would not meet it halfway. Given the day’s price action, global demand and macro sentiment is clearly still the driving force for oil. Elsewhere catching headlines is the US’ request to seize the Iranian Grace 1 tanker, which was due to be released in the coming days by the UK, who has held it in Gibraltar since July 4th over alleged EU sanction violations; if the US does seize the Grace 1, this will undoubtedly intensify tensions between Tehran and Washington.</p><p>Looking at Russia, the semi state-owned oil major, Rosneft, has requested payment for its oil product, naphtha, in Euros. This is the first time the US sanction burdened producer has requested payment in Euros and is an active effort to take tender out of the US Dollar, the world's commodity currency. Rosneft will be requesting Euros to offset existing tariffs and any potential for future tariffs made against it by the US. US-Russian ties have been deteriorating recently, with both nuclear ambitious nations backing out of their INF treaty. Since the INF breakdown Russia has been flexing its military capability, where it has flown nuclear-capable bombers close to Alaska and has been testing small-scale nuclear explosions. This latest move from Rosneft - Russia’s largest oil producer - to move away from the Dollar is likely in-part an anticipation of a rocky road ahead, and a move to reduce Moscow’s vulnerability to White House policy.</p>",

Bunds are down to 178.18 vs 178.81 at one stage, with additional pressure via more talk about German fiscal stimulus, while Gilts and US Treasuries are also just off new intraday lows of 134.65 and 130-10 compared to 135.19 and 130-31+ at best respectively, with the latest retreat prompted by China’s halfway hopes. Conversely, the Dollar is firming up again and if ip is also encouraging then the DXY could revisit late Wednesday/overnight peaks of 98.050.</p>",

(+0.3%)</strong> were heavily pressured at the open but with downside later stemmed after continued PBoC liquidity efforts in which it injected CNY 30bln through reverse repos and CNY 400bln through 1yr MLF, while reports that Hong Kong Airport resumed normal operations and with strength in China Unicom post-earnings helped soften the blow for Hong Kong which briefly turned positive. However, the recovery in the Hang Seng was short-lived due to the broad risk averse tone and with losses in index heavyweight Tencent following mixed earnings and a cautious outlook. Finally, 10yr JGBs printed fresh highs as the global recession fears spurred a safe-haven bid, which saw the 10yr, 20yr and 30yr JGB yields at their lowest in more than 3 years. This coincided with the US 2s/10s yields winding in and out of inversion and the US 30yr yield dropping below 2% for the first time on record, while mild support was also seen following stronger results at the 5yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos PBoC and conducted CNY 400bln of 1yr MLF vs. CNY 383bln maturing.</p><p><strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 7.0268 vs. Exp. 7.0236 (Prev. 7.0312)</strong></p><p>Chinese House Prices (Jul) 9.7% (Prev. 10.3%).

No notable over/under performers amongst indices which are all firmly in negative territory following the aforementioned US-China update, but as a reminder Italy’s equity markets are closed due to Assumption Day. Sectors are posting a slightly mixed performance but have also dropped firmly into negative territory, Energy names are lagging as oil prices remain under pressure with the added factor of Iran’s Grace 1 tanker reportedly to be released today; though the US Department of Justice are trying to seize the tanker. Also factoring on the complex is underperformance from Vestas Wind Systems (-3.5%), who represent 3.5% of the Stoxx 600 Oil &amp; Gas index, after missing on Q2 metrics and narrowing revenue guidance. Elsewhere, RBS (-10.0%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 weighed on by a downgrade at HSBC; note, the Co. are trading ex-dividend today. Returning to earnings, and at the other end of the Stoxx spectrum, are both GVC (+2.3%) and Carlsberg (+3.5%) after stating that FY outlook is ahead of expectations and confirming FY guidance with organic beer volume higher by 1.4% YY respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP - </strong>Upbeat jobs data has helped the Aussie withstand another bout of risk aversion prompted by an official blast from China on the trade front and reiteration that Beijing will retaliate with countermeasures against the additional Usd300 bn tariffs that contravene the G20 truce agreement. Aud/Usd is holding firmly above 0.6750, albeit off 0.6790 overnight highs spurred by a significant beat in the payroll count vs expectations, and mainly due to full time workers. Similarly, Sterling got an unexpected lift from UK retail sales data confounding consensus for some payback after previous excesses, but Cable continues to meet resistance around 1.2100.</p><p><strong>JPY - </strong>The Yen is back to roughly flat vs the Dollar and most other currency counterparts after a sudden slide in early EU trade that is still baffling market participants and pundits given no clear catalyst for the move. For the record, factors ranging from in incorrect order to official intervention have been touted, and clearly the speed of the sell-off did trigger stops and chart-based transactions, while a more macro or fundamental motive could have been a back-up in US Treasury yields and curve dis-inversion. However, risk aversion has resurfaced amidst the latest Chinese sabre-rattling and Usd/Jpy is back below 106.00 from circa 106.80 at one stage.</p><p><strong>NOK - </strong>The Norwegian Crown has also been volatile within 10.0470-9.9720 parameters against the Euro, as the Norges Bank removed specific reference to next month when maintaining guidance for further policy normalisation this year due to heightened external risks and uncertainty. Nevertheless, it remains on track for more divergence in terms of benchmark rates compared to G10 and many if not all other global Central Bank peers, bar the Riksbank.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/NZD - </strong>All relatively rangebound vs the Greenback even though overall sentiment has taken another turn for the worse after tentative signs of stability. The single currency is stuck between 1.1155-35, the Loonie is pivoting 1.3300, while the Franc has tracked its safe-haven Yen peer to a degree from around 0.9755 to 0.9725, and the Kiwi is straddling 0.6450, albeit largely on the downside towards 0.6425.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Amidst widespread deviation for global/general and more specific or unique reasons, perhaps the rebound in Usd/Cnh from circa 7.0305 lows to 7.0630 is telling/ominous after 7.0268 Usd/Cny fix. Note also, Hong Kong has slashed its 2019 GDP projection to exacerbate global growth concerns, though the Government has injected Hkd 19.1bn via economic measures to try and ward off recession.</p><p><strong>Norwegian Key Policy Rate* N/A 1.25% vs. Exp. 1.25% (Prev. 1.25%);</strong> Policy <strong>rate would most likely be increased further in the course of 2019 - No mention of September</strong>.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>To the untrained eye or for anyone that has been on an extended break, the early pull-back in bonds could easily have been seen as a more concerted retracement bearing in mind that it was rather swift and steep. However, the latest retaliatory rhetoric from Beijing has enticed bulls back in, and with a vengeance, as <strong>Bunds</strong> extend to 178.79, <strong>Gilts</strong> finally breach their previous contract peak to reach 135.19 and the <strong>10 year T-note</strong> approaches 131-00. It goes without saying that benchmark yields are plunging deeper and curves are becoming even more inverse and the fear or anticipation of recession is getting more self-propelling.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent&nbsp;and&nbsp;WTI&nbsp;prices are firmly in negative territory, post the US-China updates, and have dipped below the USD 59.00/bbl and USD 55.00/bbl</strong> levels respectively which had been somewhat of a base for the benchmarks overnight after yesterdays significant downside for the complex, which saw Brent settle lower by around 3% on the day. On the supply/geopolitical front reports indicate that it is likely Iranian tanker Grace 1 will be permitted to leave Gibraltar as Chief Minister Picardo will not renew the vessels detention order which expires on Saturday; after which a court is to decide on the next steps. However, reports indicate that the US Department of Justice has applied to seize the tanker, which casts some doubt over the likelihood of the vessels near-term release. As a reminder prior to the vessel’s seizure reports indicated that it had loaded a 2mln/bbl cargo in Iranian waters around mid-April. Elsewhere, tomorrow sees the delayed release of OPEC’s monthly oil market report, focus will be on whether it takes a similar stance to the IEA and EIA reports in cutting 2019 world oil demand growth forecast. Turning to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> (+0.4%) remains above the USD 1500/oz mark as the market has settled somewhat from yesterday’s significant risk-off moves, but didn’t benefit much from the aforementioned trade headlines; the data slate ahead includes a number of notable US data points, which may spark further bouts of global growth worry if the prints are weak. Separately, <strong>copper</strong> prices are similarly little changed in-line with the largely tentative market sentiment thus far.</p><p><strong>Gibraltar confirms that the US Department of Justice has applied to seize the Iranian supertanker on a number of allegations which are now being considered. </strong>Prior to this, the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 is to be released on Thursday as Gibraltar Chief Minister Picardo will not apply to renew order to detain the vessel and Gibraltar sources notes that it is likely Grace 1 will be permitted to leave.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European indices were initially firmer at the open but following negative updates on the US-China trade front, a further bout of risk off swept through markets [Euro Stoxx 50 -1.5%]</strong>, on reports that China’s Finance Ministry say China will have to take countermeasures on US moves and their actions violate the consensus achieved at the Osaka G20 meeting. No notable over/under performers amongst indices which are all firmly in negative territory following the aforementioned US-China update, but as a reminder Italy’s equity markets are closed due to Assumption Day. Sectors are posting a slightly mixed performance but have also dropped firmly into negative territory, Energy names are lagging as oil prices remain under pressure with the added factor of Iran’s Grace 1 tanker reportedly to be released today; though the US Department of Justice are trying to seize the tanker. Also factoring on the complex is underperformance from Vestas Wind Systems (-3.5%), who represent 3.5% of the Stoxx 600 Oil &amp; Gas index, after missing on Q2 metrics and narrowing revenue guidance. Elsewhere, RBS (-10.0%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 weighed on by a downgrade at HSBC; note, the Co. are trading ex-dividend today. Returning to earnings, and at the other end of the Stoxx spectrum, are both GVC (+2.3%) and Carlsberg (+3.5%) after stating that FY outlook is ahead of expectations and confirming FY guidance with organic beer volume higher by 1.4% YY respectively.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/GBP</strong> - Upbeat jobs data has helped the Aussie withstand another bout of risk aversion prompted by an official blast from China on the trade front and reiteration that Beijing will retaliate with countermeasures against the additional Usd300 bn tariffs that contravene the G20 truce agreement. Aud/Usd is holding firmly above 0.6750, albeit off 0.6790 overnight highs spurred by a significant beat in the payroll count vs expectations, and mainly due to full time workers. Similarly, Sterling got an unexpected lift from UK retail sales data confounding consensus for some payback after previous excesses, but Cable continues to meet resistance around 1.2100.</p><p><strong>JPY </strong>- The Yen is back to roughly flat vs the Dollar and most other currency counterparts after a sudden slide in early EU trade that is still baffling market participants and pundits given no clear catalyst for the move. For the record, factors ranging from in incorrect order to official intervention have been touted, and clearly the speed of the sell-off did trigger stops and chart-based transactions, while a more macro or fundamental motive could have been a back-up in US Treasury yields and curve dis-inversion. However, risk aversion has resurfaced amidst the latest Chinese sabre-rattling and Usd/Jpy is back below 106.00 from circa 106.80 at one stage.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong> - The Norwegian Crown has also been volatile within 10.0470-9.9720 parameters against the Euro, as the Norges Bank removed specific reference to next month when maintaining guidance for further policy normalisation this year due to heightened external risks and uncertainty. Nevertheless, it remains on track for more divergence in terms of benchmark rates compared to G10 and many if not all other global Central Bank peers, bar the Riksbank.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/NZD </strong>- All relatively rangebound vs the Greenback even though overall sentiment has taken another turn for the worse after tentative signs of stability. The single currency is stuck between 1.1155-35, the Loonie is pivoting 1.3300, while the Franc has tracked its safe-haven Yen peer to a degree from around 0.9755 to 0.9725, and the Kiwi is straddling 0.6450, albeit largely on the downside towards 0.6425.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Amidst widespread deviation for global/general and more specific or unique reasons, perhaps the rebound in Usd/Cnh from circa 7.0305 lows to 7.0630 is telling/ominous after 7.0268 Usd/Cny fix. Note also, Hong Kong has slashed its 2019 GDP projection to exacerbate global growth concerns, though the Government has injected Hkd 19.1bn via economic measures to try and ward off recession.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>To the untrained eye or for anyone that has been on an extended break, the early pull-back in bonds could easily have been seen as a more concerted retracement bearing in mind that it was rather swift and steep. However, the latest retaliatory rhetoric from Beijing has enticed bulls back in, and with a vengeance, as Bunds extend to 178.79, <strong>Gilts</strong> finally breach their previous contract peak to reach 135.19 and the 10 year T-note approaches 131-00. It goes without saying that benchmark yields are plunging deeper and curves are becoming even more inverse and the fear or anticipation of recession is getting more self-propelling.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Brent</strong> and <strong>WTI</strong> prices are firmly in negative territory, post the US-China updates, and have dipped below the USD 59.00/bbl and USD 55.00/bbl levels respectively which had been somewhat of a base for the benchmarks overnight after yesterdays significant downside for the complex, which saw Brent settle lower by around 3% on the day. On the supply/geopolitical front reports indicate that it is likely Iranian tanker Grace 1 will be permitted to leave Gibraltar as Chief Minister Picardo will not renew the vessels detention order which expires on Saturday; after which a court is to decide on the next steps. However, reports indicate that the US Department of Justice has applied to seize the tanker, which casts some doubt over the likelihood of the vessels near-term release. As a reminder prior to the vessel’s seizure reports indicated that it had loaded a 2mln/bbl cargo in Iranian waters around mid-April. Elsewhere, tomorrow sees the delayed release of OPEC’s monthly oil market report, focus will be on whether it takes a similar stance to the IEA and EIA reports in cutting 2019 world oil demand growth forecast. Turning to metals, where spot gold (+0.4%) remains above the USD 1500/oz mark as the market has settled somewhat from yesterday’s significant risk-off moves, but didn’t benefit much from the aforementioned trade headlines; the data slate ahead includes a number of notable US data points, which may spark further bouts of global growth worry if the prints are weak. Separately, copper prices are similarly little changed in-line with the largely tentative market sentiment thus far.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: US-China Goodwill Hunting",
        "content": "<p><strong>*LONG STORY SHORT:</strong> China’s Finance Ministry today noted that it will have to take countermeasures on US’ actions, which would see some of the USD 300bln worth of goods tariffed at 10% from September 1st, with the rest of the duties applied on December 15th. China added that the US’ move violates the accord reached at the Osaka G20 summit for a trade war ceasefire and to avoid applying additional tariffs.</p><p><strong>*WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR:</strong> Market participants will now be on the lookout for two developments:</p><p><strong>1) CHINA’S RETALIATION:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tariff Increase</strong>: China has currently taxed USD 110bln worth of US goods at a range of 20-25%. This levy could increase further to match the effect of US’ tax imposition on the outstanding goods, albeit the size of the goods US affected is likely to remain as US imports far more goods from China than vice versa.</li><li><strong>An unreliable entity list</strong>: This list could exclude some US firms from doing business with Chinese companies.</li><li><strong>Rare-earth restrictions:</strong> Another “weapon” in China’s arsenal. Prohibiting these rare earth exports to the US will significantly affect the hi-tech/electronic producers which may be forced to slow or even halt some US production. SCMP reported earlier this month that China’s rare earth producers are ready to weaponise their supply control and pass any tariffs as costs to US customers.</li><li><strong>Yuan</strong>: The Chinese currency weakened last week to above 7.00 against the USD, for the first time in a decade, after the US' latest escalation of trade wars. The move higher resulted in a significant risk-off reaction in markets. The PBOC's response was somewhat predictable (China will not participate in competitive devaluation of the Yuan, although the currency move prompted the US to label China as a 'currency manipulator' by the US). Despite this, the daily USD/CNY fixing has been creeping higher (ex-last two days), whilst PBoC officials kept reiterating that the Yuan is at an appropriate level at present.</li></ul><p><strong>2) TRUMP’S RESPONSE:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tariff Roll-in:</strong> The US President could walk back on the tariff delay (i.e. some goods to be taxed on December 15th) which would mean 10% on the full batch of USD 300bln worth on September 1st. Although this seems to be unlikely as Trump preferably would want to keep goods prices down heading into the Christmas shopping season.</li><li><strong>Tariff Ramp up:</strong> An increase of levy from 10% to 25% is nothing new. President Trump has threatened this a few times with the latest upon the announcement of the September 1st tariffs.</li><li><strong>Currency War:</strong> Another highly touted move, Trump has constantly criticised the Fed for the reason behind a firmer Greenback, whilst also accusing China and Europe of manipulating its currencies. Many desks highlight that Trump could use the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stability Fund to weaken the USD vs. the CNY.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/99a5ad53-5829-4f46-b16a-f13cc3cf5808.jpg\"></figure>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve bull-flattened amid risk-off trade. Much attention was on curve spreads, where the US 2s10s part of the curve inverted in Wednesday pre-market trade, which investors have traditionally associated with an increase in recession risks. BofAML analysts note that 2s10s yield curve inversions have preceded the last seven recessions and nine out of the last 12 recessions. BofAML says that the SPX can take time to peak after a yield curve inversion, noting that sometimes the S&amp;P 500 peaks within two-to-three months of a 2s10s inversion, but it can take one to two years for an S&amp;P 500 peak after an inversion. For the ten inversions back to 1956, the S&amp;P 500 topped out within approximately three months of the inversion six times (1956, 1959, 1965, 1973, 1980, and 2000), BofAML says, the S&amp;P 500 took 11 to 22 months to peak after the other four inversions (1967, 1978, 1989, and 2005). BofAML says the equity market is on borrowed time after the yield curve inverts. Continue reading the full RANsquawk analysis here.

ASX 200 (-2.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) were lower in which the energy sector led the declines in both indices after similar underperformance stateside following a near-5% drop in crude prices and with Australia mulling over a slew of earnings releases, although gold stocks have bucked the trend as the stock sell-off spurred safe-haven appeal. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) were heavily pressured at the open but with downside later stemmed after continued PBoC liquidity efforts in which it injected CNY 30bln through reverse repos and CNY 400bln through 1yr MLF, while reports that Hong Kong Airport resumed normal operations and with strength in China Unicom post-earnings helped soften the blow for Hong Kong which briefly turned positive. However, the recovery in the Hang Seng was short-lived due to the broad risk averse tone and with losses in index heavyweight Tencent following mixed earnings and cautious outlook. Finally, 10yr JGBs printed fresh highs as the global recession fears spurred a safe-haven bid, which saw the 10yr, 20yr and 30yr JGB yields at their lowest in more than 3 years. This coincided with the US 2yr/10yr yields winding in and out of inversion and the US 30yr yield dropping below 2% for the first time on record, while mild support was also seen following stronger results at the 5yr JGB auction.</p>",
