Participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the FFR at 0.00-0.25% percent until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.</p><p>Furthermore, several participants remarked that the public might view the ability of the Committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being limited after lowering rates to the ELB. However, this was countered by some by saying new forward guidance or balance sheet measures could be introduced. The minutes added that there was an \"extremely large degree\" of uncertainty on the outlook and many participants had repeatedly downgraded their outlook of late in response to the rapidly evolving situation.

However, the environment improved, and US stocks opened with cyclical sectors seeing a bounce. However, over the course of the session, the configuration became more mixed, with energy leading the gains, followed by defensive utilities; the bottom end of the pack featured consumer sectors and telecoms; all sectors were green. Attention is on the crude complex ahead of the key OPEC+ call on Thursday; there have been some positive noises suggesting OPEC+ could agree to a 10mln BPD cut; much depends on whether they can convince non-OPEC to join their efforts. Elsewhere, on the virus front, wires reported that investors were encouraged by hopeful signs of the progress of the virus in the US. Health care stocks saw some upside after Bernie Sanders announced he had suspended his Presidential campaign. McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) announced it has suspended share buybacks, is raising USD 6.5bln of debt to strengthen cash position, cuts capex; withdraws 2020 outlook, adding it does not expect March comp sales to be indicative of the nest term. US Comp Sales +0.1%, Comp sales -3.4%, global SSS -22% in March. JPMorgan (JPM) has amended the size of its mixed shelf offering to USD 64.2bln (prev. USD 50bln). Boeing (BA) found two new software issues with its 737 MAX flight control computers, according to CNBC; the Co stated the plan for the jet to return to the skies by the middle of this year and would not be delayed due to this. Note, fuselage provider Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) announced it has temporarily stopped producing for BA given the closure of Boeing facilities. SPX +3.4% at 2750, NDX +2.2% at 8230, DJIA +3.4% at 23,434.</p><p>Treasuries endured a choppy session, although ranges have been thinner and major curve spreads are ultimately steeper, lead by a strong bid at the 2-year tenor, while yields along the long-end are higher on the day. The T-Note had originally seen support in early European trade as the Eurogroup meeting failure induced risk-off. However, participants soon looked past the news amid a bid in equity futures, and yields moved higher. Duration also came under pressure after Treasury Sec. Mnuchin doubled-down on its plans for issuance out the curve, citing the (yet-to-be-released) 20-year bond, again. Corporate supply was also weighted towards the long-end across six IG issuers (although less than Monday and Tuesday), in addition to Abu Dhabi launched USD 7bln of 5s, 10s, and 30s. As the NY Fed’s daily operations got underway, the whole curve found support, and steepened, rising in sync with equities, and richening ahead of the Treasury’s upsized 30-year auction reopening, where USD 17bln was sold at a high rate of 1.325%, stopping through by 0.5bps, and was covered 2.35x; Dealers and indirects took a bit more than average at the expense of less direct participation (11% vs six-auction avg. 17.7%). By settlement, yields were mixed; worth noting in the rates complex, the white strip of Eurodollar curve was little changed, indicative of participants expectations of LIBOR to remain elevated for the near future. However, UBS’ strategists expressed their view recently that they see the rate normalising in the next month or so. US T-note futures (M0) settled 2 ticks lower at 137-27.&nbsp;</p>",

Eurogroup head Centeno tweeted, “After 16h of discussions we came close to a deal but we are not there yet”. The finance ministers will continue their meeting on Thursday. The Dutch Finance Minister tweeted that the use of the ESM has not been agreed, but the Netherlands are prepared to use it; also, reiterated opposition to Eurobonds, indicated that a majority of members are in agreement on this. To wit, Morgan Stanley believes the Eurogroup will ultimately come to a deal on Centeno’s previously outlined, three-prong proposal: 1) ESM precautionary credit lines of up to 2% of GDP (around EUR 240bln vs the EUR410bn current ESM lending capacity), which MS believes in order to be attractive for the periphery, due to their higher borrowing costs, the lines would have to offer long duration with limited conditionality; 2) an increase in contributions to the EIB to support loan guarantees, which MS says could support around EUR 200bln of loans; 3) an increase in member state support to back the Commission’s EUR 100bln unemployment re-insurance scheme (SURE) which gets behind member state schemes to pay capped salaries to furloughed workers. More broadly, MS sees the package as “further support”, citing the ECB’s PEPP as the key policy to address the crisis due to it keeping yields low, and thus, greater fiscal policy space. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The European Commission has warned EZ Finance Ministers that the EU economy could shrink by up to 10% in 2020; sources added that the ECB told ministers that EZ financing required could be up to EUR 1.5trln to address the virus crisis. However, sources reported Germany supports just EUR 500bln worth of measures at this stage. Furthermore, the FT reported the Commission is discussing proposals to overhaul the EU budget to bolster the post-pandemic recovery, which could result in an extra EUR 1.5trln for spending and investment over three years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;UK PM JOHNSON:</strong> PM Johnson remains in intensive care, though is making steady progress, a statement noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>The chief French government medical advisor said France’s confinement measures should be extended for several weeks. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA &nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>President Trump said he would ask Congress for an additional USD 250bln in small businesses relief, coming after the Treasury asked for an additional USD 250bln for the small business lending programme. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>VP Pence said evidence continues to show signs of stabilisation in virus hot spots and that the CDC will have new guidance on Wednesday regarding quarantining and how individuals can return to work. President Trump said the US is being hit hard, and it will be a painful week, but also noted there are glimmers of hope and that the country may be on track for far fewer deaths than projected, as well as maybe getting to the top of the virus curve. Trump noted they are starting to look at reopening the economy very thoroughly, which will be open again much sooner rather than later, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>While President Trump initially stated the US is going to put a hold on contribution to the WHO, noting the group is China-centric and disagreed with his travel ban, he since said the US would look into holding off funding. On the Middle Eastern front, WSJ reported the US is planning to block Iran’s request for a USD 5bln loan from the IMF to deal with the coronavirus. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FOMC MINUTES:</strong> Minutes to the Fed’s emergency meetings on 3rd and 15th meetings were always going to have a stale feel about them, given that the central bank took further actions after the meeting (boosted QE and MBS purchases on 23/Mar, expanded repo for foreign central banks on 31/Mar, and also announced six additional facilities, including the commercial paper facility). As expected, the minutes highlighted the Fed’s uncertainty, and all participants viewed the near-term outlook as having deteriorated sharply. The minutes also conveyed that officials were fearful of the outlook, even before the stay-at-home orders were issued. The minutes also reiterated now-familiar themes about how rates will remain at current levels until the Fed can be confident that the situation has turned. BMO’s analysts note that the word ‘plummet’ made four appearances, ‘uncertain’ showed up nine times, ‘deteriorated’ on six occasions, but ‘recession’ only once. “There was no discussion of the massive job losses sustained last month - which makes sense given the spike in initial jobless claims printed after the FOMC’s last gathering.” BMO also highlights a section of the minutes that reveals an in-depth discussion about Treasury market liquidity which helps justify the scale and depth of the UST purchases that began in March, although conditions have improved since then. BMO also highlights that there were no answers to some outstanding questions: “There was no discussion about how the Fed might taper it’s QE flows, whether or not they might hike the ON RRP rate and IOER in the near term,” adding that “things have simply changed so much in the past three weeks that those topics weren’t even on the table.” &nbsp;</p><p><strong>ECB’S KAZAK</strong> stated that the ECB could expand and extend the stimulus scheme if needed, can increase asset purchase volume, or even look at new instruments, including OMT. Kazak said capital key deviations would be short-term and operational. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DATA &nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS PREVIEW:</strong> Last week’s jobless claims saw a record of 6.65mln jobs, with expectations for this weeks print likely to be somewhere similar with analysts expecting a print of 5.25mln, although the ranges vary from as low as 2.5mln to 9.295mln on the top end. Continued jobless claims expected at 8mln; ranges from 2.054mln to 13.2mln. Bank of America is expecting to see another 6.5mln print. The bank tracked headlines in 16 states which it estimates to be around 2.5mln, thus assuming a similar trend it would take the total to 6.5mln. BofA however believes that risks are tiled to the upside after seeing an increase in data from Google Trends shows an increase in searches for unemployment benefits and filing for unemployment, while it notes there were signs governments are adjusting to better process the filings, adding “some states believed the worst was yet to come”. The desk also highlights the passing of the CARES act and Coronavirus Aid Relief increases eligibility for jobless claims for other workers and boost the maximum number of weeks that one can receive benefits. The desk adds this creates an incentive for businesses to temporarily furlough employees as they will be financially covered. However, seasonal factors could have an impact, “combining last week’s non-seasonally adjusted figure of 5.8mln with this week’s lower seasonal factor would result in seasonally adjusted claims of 6.2mln instead of 6.6mln that was actually reported.” &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>CRUDE&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLES USD 1.46 HIGHER AT USD 25.09/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 0.97 HIGHER AT USD 32.84/BBL&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude prices were firmer, although trade was choppy, with a late session spike higher into settlement amid reports that the Algerian Oil Minister sees a massive reduction at the “OPEC++” production at Thursday’s meeting of 10mln BPD; taken at face value, this might imply total coordinated cuts above 10mln, if other non-OPEC+ producers come to the table. A delegate overnight noted that scenarios range from 10mln BPD of output curtailment to no cuts at all. The OPEC+ group’s monitoring committee is said to be preparing a draft for proposed output cuts. Several sources have noted that the following two scenarios will be presented: 1) OPEC+ no longer being bound by production restrictions; this would see a continuation of the current state of affairs - Saudi would stick to its current production quota in excess of 12mln BPD (vs 9.7mln BPD in March). 2) OPEC members alongside Russia and other producers would implement joint 10mln BPD reductions through to the end of the year (TASS on Tuesday reported a time-frame of three months starting in May). Tass also reported later on Wednesday that Russia is ready to cut production by 1.6mln BPD. Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh stated in a letter to OPEC that Iran doesn’t agree with holding an OPEC+ meeting without having a clear and consensual outcome. At the same time, he added that vague circumstances around the OPEC+ meeting are of grave concern to him and that the absence of any clear outcome is a failure message, even before the meeting starts, which may aggravate current low oil prices further. Furthermore, Zanganeh stated that the volume of an output cut, duration, baseline level and distribution, as well as commitments by the US and Canada, should be addressed before the meeting. &nbsp; INVENTORIES: US crude inventories saw some brief selling pressure as the EIA reported a record build of 17.2mln bbls, accompanied by a 10.5mln build in gasoline and 0.5mln distillates build, as refinery utilisation dropped by a significant 6.7% and production fell from 13mln BPD to 12.4mln BPD. The eye-watering figures were mainly looked through as participants are well aware of the production cuts and storage limits as the global economy has come to a standstill. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>OPEC+(+) PREVIEW: </strong>Emergency Meeting on Thursday; G20 Energy Meeting on Friday. On Thursday, the OPEC+ meeting is to commence at 15:00BST, followed by a press conference - all times tentative. On Friday, G20 Energy Ministers will conduct a webinar at 13:00BST to discuss oil market stability. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24250/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for the full Newsquawk preview. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</a></p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME &nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 2 TICKS LOWER AT 137-27. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Treasuries endured a choppy session, although ranges have been thinner and major curve spreads are ultimately steeper, lead by a strong bid at the 2-year tenor, while yields along the long-end are higher on the day. The T-Note had originally seen support in early European trade as the Eurogroup meeting failure induced risk-off. However, participants soon looked past the news amid a bid in equity futures, and yields moved higher. Duration also came under pressure after Treasury Sec. Mnuchin doubled-down on its plans for issuance out the curve, citing the (yet-to-be-released) 20-year bond, again. Corporate supply was also weighted towards the long-end across six IG issuers (although less than Monday and Tuesday), in addition to Abu Dhabi launched USD 7bln of 5s, 10s, and 30s. As the NY Fed’s daily operations got underway, the whole curve found support, and steepened, rising in sync with equities, and richening ahead of the Treasury’s upsized 30-year auction reopening, where USD 17bln was sold at a high rate of 1.325%, stopping through by 0.5bps, and was covered 2.35x; Dealers and indirects took a bit more than average at the expense of less direct participation (11% vs six-auction avg. 17.7%). By settlement, yields were mixed; worth noting in the rates complex, the white strip of Eurodollar curve was little changed, indicative of participants expectations of LIBOR to remain elevated for the near future. However, UBS’ strategists expressed their view recently that they see the rate normalising in the next month or so.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES &nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +3.4% at 2750, NDX +2.2% at 8230, DJIA +3.4% at 23,434. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Real Estate +7.4%, Energy +6.7%, Utilities +5.4%, Materials +5%, Health Care +4.2%, Industrials +3.65, Consumer Discretionary +2.84%, Communication Svs. +2.8%, Technology +2.75%, Consumer Staples +1.4% &nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Health care stocks saw some upside after Bernie Sanders announced he had suspended his Presidential campaign. McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) announced it has suspended share buybacks, is raising USD 6.5bln of debt to strengthen cash position, cuts capex; withdraws 2020 outlook, adding it does not expect March comp sales to be indicative of the nest term. US Comp Sales +0.1%, Comp sales -3.4%, global SSS -22% in March. JPMorgan (JPM) has amended the size of its mixed shelf offering to USD 64.2bln (prev. USD 50bln). Boeing (BA) found two new software issues with its 737 MAX flight control computers, according to CNBC; the Co stated the plan for the jet to return to the skies by the middle of this year and would not be delayed due to this. Note, fuselage provider Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) announced it has temporarily stopped producing for BA given the closure of Boeing facilities. Tesla (TSLA), Dick’s (DKS) and Party City (PRTY) are to furlough workers. Marathon Oil (MRO) and Holly Frontier Corp. (HFC) cut CapEx. TAL Education (TAL) were hit after an internal report found some if its “Light Class” sales had been fabricated; its Light Class sales make up 3-4% of total revenue. E-Health (EHTH) was named as a new short. Health Insurers benefited on news Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the presidential campaign given he is an advocate for Medicare for all. Zoom Video (ZM) surged after reports it has hired a former Facebook security chief to improver its privacy, which follows recent weakness in the name as it faces lawsuits for inadequate security. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>FOREX&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>USD: </strong>The buck was marginally stronger overnight, though has deviated little from neutral. The Eurogroup failed to come to an agreement on how to fund the coronavirus stimulus bill, the press conference has been postponed until Thursday at 16:00 BST. However, as US players arrived sentiment improved which led to a firmer equity open and some reversal in the buck to unchanged levels which coincides around the 100 level on DXY. That 100 level has held as the Asia day comes into focus. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The Eurogroup’s failure to strike a stimulus deal has soured sentiment, while growth projections from the Bank of France also contributed to caution in the early part of trade. EURUSD was slightly weaker against the buck today and gave up the 1.09 figure following the stale mate in talks, while France extending its lockdown did little to benefit the single currency. ING believes the impact will be limited as expectations are not high for a coronabond and currently the fiscal risk premium is not a main driver of the EUR, adding that the stabilising risk apetite should slow dollar appreciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The economy watcher’s survey was grim, falling to a record low; Capital Economics said it supports its view that consumption will fall off a cliff in Q2. “Almost all indicators plummeted, suggesting the brief thaw in economic activity in mid-March was swiftly ended by a devastating cold front.” Household inflation expectations one-year ahead fell to 2.0% from 2.5%. USDJPY fairly uneventful today trading within 108-52-109-09 parameters, with the cross relatively flat heading into overnight trade. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD: </strong>AUD initially weaker overnight after S&amp;P cut its outlook on Australia to AAA; outlook negative from stable, while citing downside and fiscal risks. RBC highlights the rationale for the downgrade is not particularly surprising and S&amp;P are right to highlight the risks due to the uncertainty on the trajectory on both domestic and global economy while domestic factors such as historically high household debt are also a concern. It said however that its own GDP expectations for Australia were much weaker than S&amp;P’s. In an international context, AU is still better placed than many others to deliver the fiscal stimulus (and has already announced measures that go well beyond its G10 counterparts)”. However, as sentiment improved the cyclical currency reversed course and reclaimed 0.62 to the upside. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> In similar price action to its Antipodean counterpart, NZD was lower overnight spurred by dovish comments from RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby noting the bank is open to expanding its QE in a rapidly evolving situation, noting there is no limit to how much of the bond market it can buy, adding it is considering other assets for QE, including linkers. The comments saw NZDUSD hit lows of 0.5940 although picked up steam in similar vein to AUD as risk sentiment improved which saw the cross reclaim 0.60 to the upside. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD: </strong>The Loonie slightly weaker today against the buck remaining above the 1.40 region heading into overnight trade while CAD losses are limited amid a rise in oil prices, While comments from Canadian officials note that businesses now only need to show a 15% drop in March revenue Y/Y (prev. 30%) to receive the 75% wage subsidy. Participants will be looking to tomorrows employment report. Scotiabank states “We prefer to look for opportunities to fade USD gains to the 1.4150/75 range.” &nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Sterling is firmer on the day, in line with other risk sensitive FX, and cable lingers around 1.24 as Asia day begins. Analysts at Lloyds suggest the pullback from 1.25 is a correction before a move higher to 1.27 and perhaps north of 1.33, from a technical perspective, although if a move beneath 1.2165 occurred it would become a worry for the bulls and opens the door to support at 1.2025 -1.1950. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>BRL: </strong>BCB chief Campos Neto late Tuesday said the central bank was looking at measures for both big and small companies. This morning Neto noted the BCB stands ready to intervene in FX more aggressively than it has ever done, adding although Brazil has a free-floating FX regime, the central bank will act when volatility or FX moves are out of line or disorderly. Neto noted that most stimulus in other countries accounts to 6-7% of GDP, he stated this is a high figure and we have to “see what happens”. The Lower House will today vote on proposals to vote on expanded coronavirus relief measures. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>MXN: </strong>The Banxico minutes release saw little reaction to the Peso, but the currency continued to appreciate against the dollar likely benefitting from firmer oil prices ahead of tomorrow’s OPEC+ call. The Banxico minutes showed all members noted the world economy and growth outlook deteriorated rapidly and significantly, while some argued possibility of a global recession has increased but one pointed towards an economic recovery next year. The minutes also highlighted the moves from the Federal reserve, and the Banxico have previously kept an eye on US interest rates. &nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Treasuries endured a choppy session, although ranges have been thinner and major curve spreads are ultimately steeper, lead by a strong bid at the 2-year tenor, while yields along the long-end are higher on the day. The T-Note had originally seen support in early European trade as the Eurogroup meeting failure induced risk-off. However, participants soon looked past the news amid a bid in equity futures, and yields moved higher. Duration also came under pressure after Treasury Sec. Mnuchin doubled-down on its plans for issuance out the curve, citing the (yet-to-be-released) 20-year bond, again. Corporate supply was also weighted towards the long-end across six IG issuers (although less than Monday and Tuesday), in addition to Abu Dhabi launched USD 7bln of 5s, 10s, and 30s. As the NY Fed’s daily operations got underway, the whole curve found support, and steepened, rising in sync with equities, and richening ahead of the Treasury’s upsized 30-year auction reopening, where USD 17bln was sold at a high rate of 1.325%, stopping through by 0.5bps, and was covered 2.35x; Dealers and indirects took a bit more than average at the expense of less direct participation (11% vs six-auction avg. 17.7%). By settlement, yields were mixed; worth noting in the rates complex, the white strip of Eurodollar curve was little changed, indicative of participants expectations of LIBOR to remain elevated for the near future, although UBS’ strategists expressed their view recently that they see the rate normalising in the next month or so.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>USD:</strong> The buck was marginally stronger overnight, though has deviated little from neutral. The Eurogroup failed to come to an agreement on how to fund the coronavirus stimulus bill, the press conference has been postponed until Thursday at 16:00 BST. However, as US players arrived sentiment improved which led to a firmer equity open and some reversal in the buck to unchanged levels which coincides around the 100 level on DXY. That 100 level has held as the Asia day comes into focus.</li><li><strong>EUR:</strong> The Eurogroup's failure to strike a stimulus deal has soured sentiment, while growth projections from the Bank of France also contributed to caution in the early part of trade. EURUSD was slightly weaker against the buck today and gave up the 1.09 figure following the stale mate in talks, while France extending its lockdown did little to benefit the single currency. ING believes the impact will be limited as expectations are not high for a coronabond and currently the fiscal risk premium is not a main driver of the EUR, adding that the stabilising risk apetite should slow dollar appreciation.</li><li><strong>JPY:</strong> The economy watcher's survey was grim, falling to a record low; Capital Economics said it supports its view that consumption will fall off a cliff in Q2. \"Almost all indicators plummeted, suggesting the brief thaw in economic activity in mid-March was swiftly ended by a devastating cold front.\" Household inflation expectations one-year ahead fell to 2.0% from 2.5%. USDJPY fairly uneventful today trading within 108-52-109-09 parameters, with the cross relatively flat heading into overnight trade.</li><li><strong>AUD:</strong> AUD initially weaker overnight after S&amp;P cut its outlook on Australia to AAA; outlook negative from stable, while citing downside and fiscal risks. RBC highlights the rationale for the downgrade is not particularly surprising and S&amp;P are right to highlight the risks due to the uncertainty on the trajectory on both domestic and global economy while domestic factors such as historically high household debt are also a concern. It said however that its own GDP expectations for Australia were much weaker than S&amp;P’s. In an international context, AU is still better placed than many others to deliver the fiscal stimulus (and has already announced measures that go well beyond its G10 counterparts)”. However, as sentiment improved the cyclical currency reversed course and reclaimed 0.62 to the upside.</li><li><strong>NZD:</strong> In similar price action to its Antipodean counterpart, NZD was lower overnight spurred by dovish comments from RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby noting the bank is open to expanding its QE in a rapidly evolving situation, noting there is no limit to how much of the bond market it can buy, adding it is considering other assets for QE, including linkers. The comments saw NZDUSD hit lows of 0.5940 although picked up steam in similar vein to AUD as risk sentiment improved which saw the cross reclaim 0.60 to the upside.</li><li><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie slightly weaker today against the buck remaining above the 1.40 region heading into overnight trade while CAD losses are limited amid a rise in oil prices, While comments from Canadian officials note that businesses now only need to show a 15% drop in March revenue Y/Y (prev. 30%) to receive the 75% wage subsidy. Participants will be looking to tomorrows employment report. Scotiabank states “We prefer to look for opportunities to fade USD gains to the 1.4150/75 range.”</li><li><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling is firmer on the day, in line with other risk sensitive FX, and cable lingers around 1.24 as Asia day begins. Analysts at Lloyds suggest the pullback from 1.25 is a correction before a move higher to 1.27 and perhaps north of 1.33, from a technical perspective, although if a move beneath 1.2165 occurred it would become a worry for the bulls and opens the door to support at 1.2025 -1.1950.</li><li><strong>BRL:</strong> BCB chief Campos Neto late Tuesday said the central bank was looking at measures for both big and small companies. This morning Neto noted the BCB stands ready to intervene in FX more aggressively than it has ever done, adding although Brazil has a free-floating FX regime, the central bank will act when volatility or FX moves are out of line or disorderly. Neto noted that most stimulus in other countries accounts to 6-7% of GDP, he stated this is a high figure and we have to “see what happens”. The Lower House will today vote on proposals to vote on expanded coronavirus relief measures.</li><li><strong>MXN:</strong> The Banxico minutes release saw little reaction to the Peso, but the currency continued to appreciate against the dollar likely benefitting from firmer oil prices ahead of tomorrow’s OPEC+ call. The Banxico minutes showed all members noted the world economy and growth outlook deteriorated rapidly and significantly, while some argued possibility of a global recession has increased but one pointed towards an economic recovery next year. The minutes also highlighted the moves from the Federal reserve, and the Banxico have previously kept an eye on US interest rates.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>Crude prices were firmer, although choppy with a late session spike higher into settlement, amid OPEC+ production cut ramblings and firmer risk appetite seen in equities. The late session rally coincided with some optimistic comments from the Algerian Oil Minister in Argus, suggesting a massive reduction at the “OPEC++” meeting that could reach 10mln BPD. A delegate overnight noted that scenarios range from 10mln BPD of output curtailment to no cuts at all. The OPEC+ group’s monitoring committee is said to be preparing a draft for proposed output cuts. Several sources, via Energy Intel, note two scenarios will reportedly be presented: 1) The first scenario sees OPEC+ no longer being bound by production restrictions. This set-up would see a continuation of the current state of affairs - Saudi would stick to its current production quota in excess of 12mln BPD (vs 9.7mln BPD in March). 2) In the second scenario, OPEC members alongside Russia and other producers would implement joint 10mln BPD reductions through to the end of the year (TASS on Tuesday reported a time-frame of three months starting in May). Tass also reported later on Wednesday that Russia is ready to cut production by 1.6mln BPD. Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh stated in a letter to OPEC that Iran doesn’t agree with holding an OPEC+ meeting without having a clear and consensual outcome. At the same time, he added that vague circumstances around the OPEC+ meeting are of grave concern to him and that the absence of any clear outcome is a failure message, even before the meeting starts, which may aggravate current low oil prices further. Furthermore, Zanganeh stated that the volume of an output cut, duration, baseline level and distribution, as well as commitments by the US and Canada, should be addressed before the meeting. Meanwhile, US crude inventories saw some brief selling pressure as the EIA reported a record build of 17.2mln bbls, accompanied by a 10.5mln build in gasoline and 0.5mln distillates build, as refinery utilisation dropped by a significant 6.7% and production fell from 13mln BPD to 12.4mln BPD. The eye-watering figures were mainly looked through as participants are well aware of the production cuts and storage limits as the global economy has come to a standstill.</li><li><strong>OPEC+(+) PREVIEW: </strong>Emergency Meeting on Thursday; G20 Energy Meeting on Friday. On Thursday, the OPEC+ meeting is to commence at 15:00BST, followed by a press conference - all times tentative. On Friday, G20 Energy Ministers will conduct a webinar at 13:00BST to discuss oil market stability. <i>Click </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24250/download\"><i>here</i></a><i> for the full Newsquawk preview.</i></li></ul>",

        "content": "<ul><li>On the 3rd March, the Fed cut rates by 50bps in an emergency move. And then on 15th March weekend meeting, the Fed took further aggressive steps, slashing rates by 100bps to 0.25% in its second inter-meeting rate move; it also committed to at least USD 700bln of QE, eased regulatory pressure on banks to free up capital, and announced dollar swap lines with other central banks. &nbsp;</li><li>The timing of the both announcements and the scope of the measures was a surprise -- in effect, it was the Fed's 'whatever it takes' commitment to ensure the smooth functioning of markets amid the virus fallout. &nbsp;</li><li>NOTE: It is not clear whether the release of the minutes will cover both meetings, or just the latter; it is also unclear that if the minutes do cover both meetings, whether the release will be in two separate documents, or one aggregated one. Analysts at Nomura, however, have stated that the minutes will cover actions taken at both meetings.&nbsp;</li><li>Since then, it has flooded the market with liquidity, resulting in the premium for dollars easing. Its balance sheet has ballooned to by USD 1.5trln to a new record high USD 5.86trln, and it has seen wide take-up of its liquidity facilities from banks and other central banks. &nbsp;</li><li>The meeting minutes are unlikely to contain anything to spook markets, given that it has rolled-out measures to assuage market concerns, and will likely reiterate its pledge to support the financial system. Analysts think the discussions will likely show a most participants backing the use of the Fed's toolkit aggressively, as COVID-19 outbreak began weighing on activity. &nbsp;</li><li>The minutes may, however, feel stale. Since the 15th March meeting, the Fed has announced other measures (boosted QE and MBS purchases on 23/Mar, expanded repo for foreign central banks on 31/Mar, and also announced six further facilities, including the commercial paper facility). Discussions around these themes will likely appear in the next meeting minutes for the 28-29th April meeting, analysts believe.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;NOTE: Fed Chair Powell will be delivering remarks via weblink on Thursday, and will likely emphasise the themes within the minutes. &nbsp;</li></ul>",

SocGen thinks the 30-year sector looks rich on asset swap, noting that although the 5s30s curve had steepened meaningfully after the last month's 30-year auction, it retraced most of the move and is currently slightly above the level before the March 30-year reopening. It also points out that the current WI yield for the sector is trading close to the stop-out yield of the March reopening. “A rich outright valuation may deter some investors from participating in the auction,” SocGen writes, “relatively high dealer holdings in the 11-years+ sector imply that dealers have limited ability to absorb supply.”</p><p><strong>RECENT 30-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.32%, six-auction avg. 2.105%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 4bps, six-auction avg. 0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.36x, six-auction avg. 2.38x)&nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 21.6%, six-auction avg. 19.8%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 8.9%, six-auction avg. 17.7%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 69.5%, six-auction avg. 62.5%)&nbsp;</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>A whip-saw Wednesday for the Dollar and currency markets overall as risk sentiment waxed and waned ahead of potentially pivotal pre-Easter events in the form of delayed OPEC+ and Eurogroup meetings. The <strong>DXY </strong>has been holding above the psychological 100.000 mark for the most part, but not convincingly and may be cautious ahead of upcoming FOMC minutes before a more timely update on the state of the US economy from Fed chair Powell tomorrow.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Sterling has notched a new wtd high vs the Greenback just a whisker shy of 1.2400 and remains firm across the board following the latest encouraging medical report on UK PM Johnson who is in a stable condition and responding well to treatment. However, the Aussie and Kiwi have both arguably performed even better amidst faltering risk appetite and independent weights, such as S&amp;P revising its outlook to negative from stable for the still triple AAA rated sovereign and ANZ’s even more downcast business sentiment reading respectively. Indeed, Aud/Usd posted a fresh, albeit fractional peak over 0.6200 in recent trade and Nzd/Usd rebounded from sub-0.5950 to a few pips above 0.6000 before topping out again.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Although crude prices have not recoiled on the back of another considerably bigger than expected US weekly inventory build in anticipation of the oil cartel and other major global producers reaching agreement on a quota cut, the Loonie is lagging its US counterpart and all G10 rivals in wake of Canadian housing data showing weaker starts and permits prior to the real fallout from COVID-49. Usd/Cad has duly retraced further from Tuesday’s circa 1.3945 trough and firmly back on the 1.4000 handle in advance of March’s jobs report that is widely forecast to be bleak in keeping with US NFP last Friday.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>The Yen has largely retained an underlying safety premium above 109.00 in the run up to Thursday’s likely game-changers, unlike the Franc that remains caught between bouts of Buck strength and Euro weakness on more pronounced nCoV contagion plus the lack of coordinated fiscal Eurozone action. Hence, Usd/Chf is pivoting 0.9700, while Eur/Chf hugs 1.0550 and Eur/Usd lags nearer the bottom of 1.0902-1.0831 parameters.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Aside from wider risk considerations and the Dollar’s ongoing gyrations, regional Central Bank impulses have been influential for the Pln, Czk and Brl in particular. To recap, the NBP defied consensus with blanket 50 bp benchmark rate cuts, Czech Parliament approved a bill to provide the CNB with a QE mandate and the BCB signalled more aggressive currency intervention.</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>The situation was calm in Asia though soured as the Europeans arrived amid headlines noting the lack of progress by finance ministers in striking a stimulus deal. Asian stocks outside of Japan, Taiwan and NZ were lower, and European bourses are also trading on the soft side. Gold is higher, crude is slightly firmer, and yields along the Treasury curve are mixed, though there seems to be a bias towards a steeper curve. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET FOCUS:</strong> The market's focus is firmly on Eurogroup and OPEC; the former are trying to thrash out a mega stimulus deal in response to coronavirus - the Europeans could announce stimulus worth 5% of the bloc's GDP, which would help to stabilise sentiment, and possibly result in equity inflows; the latter is attempting to engineer a coordinated global supply cut deal to boost crude prices. Both are key events worth keeping on equity trader's radars - crude has been playing a significant role in equity sentiment, particularly around the 1430 ET settlement. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>VIRUS: </strong>While many have been focusing on the easing pace of new cases, we noted earlier in the week that the focus may shift towards the death rate, and signs of any second wave reinfections. Analysts at Citi today follow-up on that theme, stating that the market will be paying more attention to rising death rates even as infections slow; the bank notes that the lockdown on Wuhan was lifted, which has resulted in tens of thousands leaving the city to disperse across China -- the risk of reinfection is one to watch closely. It is worth noting NIH’s Fauci has stated that beyond this week, the US should begin to see a turnaround and that the US is planning to ease back into normal activity if COVID-10 mitigation efforts are successful. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>SECTOR THEMES:</strong> Of note for retailers who have benefitted from the panic stockpiling of goods as the coronavirus pandemic broke out, today Tesco (TSCO LN) provided an update noting the initial bout of panic buying has subsided, and sales are returning to a normal pace. Some desks highlight that if the sales were to return to normal for other retailers, on both sides of the pond, it could act as a headwind as the panic buying slows down. It is also worth highlighting ahead of the Easter holiday that footfall is likely to be down heavily given the current lockdowns and store closures. All sectors in positive territory with defensives the relative under performers, while energy leads the pack today.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US EQUITY STORIES:</strong> McDonald's Corp. (MCD) announced it has suspended share buybacks, is raising USD 6.5bln of debt to strengthen cash position, cut capex; and withdrew its 2020 outlook, adding it does not expect March comp sales to be indicative of the nest term. US Comp Sales +0.1%, Comp sales -3.4%, global SSS -22% in March. JP Morgan (JPM) has amended the size of its mixed shelf offering to USD 64.2bln (prev. USD 50bln). Boeing (BA) found two new software issues with its 737 MAX flight control computers, according to CNBC; the Co stated the plan for the jet to return to the skies by the middle of this year and would not be delayed due to this. Note, fuselage provider Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) announced it has temporarily stopped producing for BA given the closure of Boeing facilities. Tesla (TSLA), Dick’s (DKS) and Party City (PRTY) are to furlough workers. Marathon Oil (MRO) and Holly Frontier Corp. (HFC) cut CapEx. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>BEAR MARKET RALLY</strong>: Nomura says the stock market rally seen at the start of the week was led by exits from bearish trades, including a squeeze on short positions held by systematic traders. \"Most investors (apart from some with short investment horizons) are still in standby mode, and some may be inclined to sell whatever rallies come along,\" the bank's quant desk writes, \"the pick-up in investor sentiment looks like no more than the sort of spontaneous rebound in sentiment that one would normally expect under the circumstances,\" adding that we should view this rally as nothing more than an \"unenthusiastic, inorganic bear market rally.\" Its quants say that the key technical indicator is CTAs' net positions in NASDAQ 100 futures (it appears that CTAs were quick to swing long on NASDAQ 100 futures), which can be read as a leading indicator of what may happen in other equity futures markets. For the next week or two, it is critical to examine \"whether the CTAs that are currently driving the rally manage to smoothly pass the baton to fundamentals-oriented investors without anyone dropping it.\" Nomura says that, should the baton get dropped, it expects CTAs' net buying of NASDAQ 100 futures to wind down by 22 April. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>LIQUIDITY:</strong> Note, as the market holiday on Friday and Monday approaches, trading may become a function of liquidity, volatility and positioning, Goldman Sachs has said. Liquidity is expected to taper-off as the holidays approach, which could make for choppy trading conditions amid possible macro headline risk. &nbsp;</p>",

The OPEC+ group’s monitoring committee is said to be preparing a draft for prospective output cuts. Several sources via Energy Intel note two scenarios will reportedly be presented: 1) The first scenario sees OPEC+ no longer being bound by production restrictions. This set-up would see a continuation of the current state of affairs - Saudi would stick to its current production quota in excess of 12mln BPD (vs. 9.7mln BPD in March) 2) In the second scenario, OPEC members alongside Russia and other producers would implement joint 10mln BPD reductions through to the end of the year, whilst TASS yesterday reported a time-frame of three months. Elsewhere, last night’s APIs proved to be another bearish release, with inventories building 11.9mln barrels vs. Exp. build of 9.3mln. Albeit, prices remained locked onto OPEC headlines. The release of the EIA STEO (ahead of next week’s OPEC and IEA Oil Market Reports) encapsulated the March impact of COVID-19, the agency cut 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 5.6mln BPD to 5.23mln BPD and raised 2021 forecast by 4.68mln BPD to 6.41mln BPD.

Brent meanwhile briefly dipped below USD 32.00/bbl having earlier tested resistance at USD 33/bbl (intraday high). Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> remains steady and within a relatively narrow USD 1640-57/oz intraday band. <strong>Copper prices</strong> meanwhile wiped out mild overnight gains as risk sentiment deteriorated after reports EZ finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on EU-wide stimulus to combat COVID-19.

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has reversed further from Tuesday’s post-RBA peaks in wake of S&amp;P’s ratings review that came with a sting in the tail as the agency downgraded its outlook on the sovereign’s AAA standing. Aud/Usd is back below 0.6150 vs 0.6200+ when broad risk sentiment was still buoyant and its Antipodean peer was also outpacing the Usd on the 0.6000 handle compared to just under 0.5950 currently. In terms of Kiwi specifics, RBNZ Deputy Governor underlined the severity of the COVID-19 contagion overnight by stating that QE can be expanded to include other assets like linkers given that the pool of conventional bonds that can be purchased is limited. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost 1.4000+ status after failing to test sub-1.3950 resistance ahead of Canadian housing data and against the backdrop of idling crude prices awaiting tomorrow’s OPEC+ showdown.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on a weaker footing against the US Dollar as risk appetite wanes, but with the Euro also undermined by the Eurogroup’s failure to resolve differences on a coordinated fiscal response to the coronavirus even though dire economic predictions continue to unfurl, ie French Q1 GDP -6% per the BdF and Germany contracting almost 10% in the current quarter according to leading institutes. Eur/Usd holding between 1.0902-1.0831 parameters and perhaps propped by an array of decent option expiries stretching from 1.0800 to 1.0900 – full details available via the headline feed at 7.33BST. Meanwhile, the Franc is skirting 0.9700, but retaining an underlying safe-haven premium relative to the single currency as the cross hovers around 1.0550 and Sterling is also somewhat mixed awaiting more UK nCoV updates and progress reports from hospital where PM Johnson remains in intensive care. Cable is clinging to 1.2300 and Eur/Gbp is meandering in the low 0.8800 area, well above 1.5 bn expiry interest from 0.8700 to 0.8710.</p><p><strong>JPY/DXY</strong></p><p>The Yen and Buck are still jostling for position amidst fluctuating risk-on/off phases, with Usd/Jpy confined to narrow 109.00-108.50 extremes and the index not much more adventurous in advance of weekly US mortgage applications and FOMC minutes either side of 100.00, albeit with a firmer bias on balance up to 100.430 at best.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>A general loss of momentum alongside risk assets overall, and with the Nok perhaps acknowledging another dip in Norwegian inflation plus a pretty stark prognosis from the Stats office about the scale of non-oil growth for the month of March alone (-14%). However, the Zar has regained composure and is trying to resume its recovery mission from record lows following some rare positive news from Eskon claiming it has enough funding for 2020 and will not need more cash from the Government.</p>",

SocGen thinks the 30-year sector looks rich on asset swap, noting that although the 5s30s curve had steepened meaningfully after the last month's 30-year auction, it retraced most of the move and is currently slightly above the level before the March 30-year reopening. It also points out that the current WI yield for the sector is trading close to the stop-out yield of the March reopening. “A rich outright valuation may deter some investors from participating in the auction,” SocGen writes, “relatively high dealer holdings in the 11-years+ sector imply that dealers have limited ability to absorb supply.”</p><p><strong>RECENT 30-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.32%, six-auction avg. 2.105%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Tail: (prev. 4bps, six-auction avg. 0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.36x, six-auction avg. 2.38xx)&nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 21.6%, six-auction avg. 19.8%)&nbsp;</li><li>Direct: (prev. 8.9%, six-auction avg. 17.7%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 69.5%, six-auction avg. 62.5%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>",

However, Gilts are lagging ahead of the next Gbp4 bn+ leg of this month’s DMO issuance remit via 2030 and 2025 maturities that will be auctioned separately like Tuesday’s 2 offerings and may not be quite as well sponsored given less concession. Meanwhile, 3 month contracts have clawed back some of yesterday’s relatively pronounced losses, bar Jun20 that is 1 tick adrift vs 1-2 tick gains elsewhere.</p>",

(-0.3%) </strong>conformed to the early cautious tone in the region amid PBoC liquidity inaction but with downside stemmed after the State Council continued to outline supportive measures and after outbound travel restrictions were lifted from Wuhan which was the former epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded back above the 152.00 level but with price action rangebound amid the indecision in Japan and following a tepid Rinban announcement in which the BoJ are present in the market for a total of JPY 670bln of JGBs in 1-3yr and 5-10yr maturities with the amounts unchanged from prior operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a met neutral daily position.

The selling began at the tail-end of the APAC session, as stock futures gained traction heading into the European day. The steepener was further supported by comments from NEC Director Kudlow, who said the Treasury was aiming to reopen the 20-year bond amid the virus outbreak – Treasury Sec. Mnuchin has made similar comments in the past. Germany announcing plans for a new 15-year bond syndication, which pressured EGBs, lending an offer across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Fed continues to remove the stabilisers, purchasing a reduced clip of USD 50bln for a second day this week, although bid/ask spreads remain tight with decent volume in the futures, indicative of healthy market depth, as opposed to the lack of such back in March when the Fed stepped in. Duration was hit further by concession ahead of the 10-year auction reopening, where the Treasury sold USD 25bln, tailing by 0.7bps, marking the lowest ever high rate on a 10-year auction; the auction otherwise printed results similar to the six-auction averages, covered 2.43x and dealers taking 27.6%. Bidders in the Treasury complex were also dissuaded as the corporate issuance bonanza continued, with nine investment grade issuers on Tuesday (versus eleven on Monday), and even a few high-yield deals coming to the market; Qatar was out with a three-part USD 10bln issue, only widened the supply for participants to digest.

        "content": "<p>A tentative tone was observed in Asia-Pac bourses following the lacklustre performance stateside where all major indices finished with marginal losses after the initial risk on tone eventually lost steam ahead of looming key risk events including the conclusion of the Eurogroup deliberations, FOMC minutes and tomorrow’s OPEC+ meeting. ASX 200 (+0.7%) traded choppy with the early heavy losses in Australia triggered by weakness across the top-weighted financials sector after the regulator issued guidance on banks and insurers in an effort to restrict dividends and with sentiment also dampened after S&amp;P cut the outlook on the country’s AAA sovereign rating to negative from stable, although the index later shrugged off the losses as the sentiment improved in late trade, while the Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) was also indecisive for most the session after the cabinet approved a record JPY 108tln stimulus package and declared a month-long state of emergency as expected. Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) conformed to the early cautious tone in the region amid PBoC liquidity inaction but with downside stemmed after the State Council continued to outline supportive measures and after outbound travel restrictions were lifted from Wuhan which was the former epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded back above the 152.00 level but with price action rangebound amid the indecision in Japan and following a tepid Rinban announcement in which the BoJ are present in the market for a total of JPY 670bln of JGBs in 1-3yr and 5-10yr maturities with the amounts unchanged from prior operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) are choppy with the early heavy losses in Australia triggered by weakness across the top weighted financials sector after the regulator issued guidance on banks and insurers in an effort to restrict dividends and with sentiment also dampened after S&amp;P cut the outlook on country’s AAA sovereign rating to negative from stable, while the Japanese benchmark is choppy after the cabinet approved a record JPY 108tln stimulus package and declared a month-long state of emergency as expected. Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) conform to the broad cautious tone in the region amid PBoC liquidity inaction but with downside stemmed after the State Council continued to outline supportive measures and after outbound travel restrictions were lifted from Wuhan which was the former epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively stable ahead of the upcoming FOMC minutes although has recouped some of the recent losses to reclaim the 100.00 level, while its major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD pulling back below the 1.0900 handle ahead of the delayed Eurogroup post meeting press conference which has been pushed back to 1000CEST and where ministers were said to discuss a coordinated funding response to address the COVID-19 fall out that could see measures worth 4.5-5.0% of GDP. GBP/USD is stable with price action remaining above near-term support at 1.2300 as reports suggest PM Johnson’s condition is stable in ICU. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy amid the indecision in Japan with the pair back below 109.00 after the optimism petered out during US hours, and antipodeans are also weighed by the subdued risk tone which saw AUD/USD and NZD/USD extend the pullback from resistance at the 0.6200 and 0.6000 handles respectively with the former not helped by the recent downward revised on Australia’s sovereign outlook.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs trade back above the 152.00 level but with price action rangebound amid the indecision in Japan and following a tepid Rinban announcement in which the BoJ are present in the market for a total of JPY 670bln of JGBs in 1-3yr and 5-10yr maturities with the amounts unchanged from prior operations.&nbsp;</p>",
