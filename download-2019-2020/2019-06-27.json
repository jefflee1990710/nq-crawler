There were also comments from US NEC Director Kudlow that there are no preconditions in trade talks with China, while he added that the US may move ahead with additional tariffs on Chinese products and nothing was agreed upon before the Trump-Xi meeting. (Politico/Fox News)</p><p>Senior US official said President Trump's decision on whether to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods is contingent on the Xi meeting, with nothing agreed ahead of time and that it is unlikely the US would agree to lift the Huawei restrictions. Furthermore, there were reports that the US will not give China a 'balanced' trade deal due to past transgressions made by China, although a truce is possible even if there is no agreement on the issues, while the sources added that it is not clear how long a truce would last as President Trump likes deadline pressure and USTR Lighthizer doesn't. (Newswires/CNBC)</p><p>Chinese President Xi is intending on presenting US President Trump with a set of terms that the US needs to meet before Beijing will be prepared to settle the trade dispute, according to reports citing a Chinese Official. Beijing is said to be insisting that the US remove its ban on tech sales to Huawei, lift all punitive tariffs and drop efforts to get China to buy even more US exports. However, reports noted that despite these preconditions, President Xi is not anticipated to undertake a confrontational stance with US President Trump and will outline his visions as to the optimal bilateral relations between the two countries. (Newswires)</p><p>China's MOFCOM urged the US to immediately cancel sanctions on Chinese firms including Huawei and stated that it opposes US abuse of export control, while it is also to consider placing firms on an unreliable list if they implement discriminatory measures on Chinese entities and also firms that threaten the national security of China. In related news, China MOFCOM spokesman Geng stated they are not aware of the SCMP report regarding a tentative trade deal. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times Editor tweeted that 2-days prior to Trump-Xi meeting, US President Trump claims to have a Plan B and has threatened new tariffs which is a very unfriendly move and will for sure have a negative impact. (Twitter)</p><p>PBoC reiterated that the CNY will be kept reasonably stable and that it will not resort to flood-like stimulus, while it also repeated that monetary policy should neither be too tight nor too loose and that the Chinese economy faces increasing external uncertainties.

Walgreens (WBA) surged following a beat on top and bottom line estimates. Alternatively, earnings were less favourable for Conagra Brands (CAG) and Accenture (ACN), where Conagra missed both estimates, whilst lowering guidance, and Accenture reported disappointing new bookings. Goldman downgraded both Nordstrom (JWN) and Ross Stores (ROST) to Sell, seeing the two retailers come under pressure. Wedbush initiated coverage on several chipmakers, where Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) benefitted from Outperform ratings, whilst Intel (INTC) and Western Digital (WDC) traded lower thanks to Underperform ratings. Other stocks catching a bid on upgrades: CenturyLink (CTL) @ Wells Fargo; Owens Corning at BofA; TripAdvisor (TRIP) at DA Davidson. Travelers (TRV) was another notable downgrade, which sold off after Deutsche Bank reduced the insurer to Sell from Hold. Ford (F) was an outperformer amid being initiated with an Outperform at Credit Suisse, as well as announcing 12,000 job cuts in Europe by 2020. Twitter saw some brief downside on reports it will put warning labels on tweets from global leaders that violate its terms of service.

Weak ESI out of the Eurozone provided some impetus to the FI complex, and gains extended into the US open, after more woes at Boeing saw equity futures come under pressure. A WSJ article which was negative on trade developments allowed the upside to continue. Pending home sales data and hawkish remarks from Kudlow on trade allowed the bulls to continue to reign. The US 7-year auction stopped through the screens by 0.2bps, and cover improved though remained beneath the six auction average. The direct bid was strong, and the indirect bid subsequently eased a touch. The complex was near highs at settlement. US T-note futures settled 11 ticks higher at 127-30.</p>",

The SCMP’s report was denied by China’s MOFCOM. Later, the WSJ reported that Xi will provide a list of terms that Beijing want the US to meet before any deal can be reached (three demands were: US to remove Huawei ban, US to drop all punitive tariffs, US to drop efforts to compel China to buy more US goods), potentially presenting another challenge to the prospects of a deal. However, CNBC said that although the US will not offer a ‘balanced’ trade deal, due to China’s past transgressions, a truce is still possible, with the news agency noting that China’s conditions are for the eventual trade deal, not this weekend’s meeting between Xi and Trump, offering some hope of a friendly set of post-G20 statements from the two countries. NEC Director Kudlow later said there are no preconditions in trade talks with China, but said that the US might move ahead with additional tariffs on Chinese products, which saw risk-off type trade; nothing was agreed upon before the Trump-Xi meeting, Kudlow told Fox. One newswire, citing a US official, said Trump's decision on whether to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods is contingent on the Xi meeting, with nothing agreed ahead of time; unlikely US would agree to lift the Huawei restrictions.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P AFFIRMED US’ AA+ RATINGS, OUTLOOK REMAINS STABLE. </strong>S&amp;P said ratings were constrained by high general government debt and fiscal deficits, and relatively short-term-oriented policy-making. It expects a negative impact of trade disputes with China and, to a lesser extent, other countries, to be marginal on US GDP growth. It also said that trade and other tensions might persist for several years.</p><p><strong>* US Q1 GDP REVISIONS (FINAL):&nbsp; </strong>The headline remained unchanged at a solid 3.1%, final GDP data for Q1 showed. Desks noted that a significant downward revision to consumer spending was offset by upward revisions in business investment (NOTE: a key risk the FOMC has identified), as well as government spending, and residential investment. Final sales (a gauge of domestic momentum) was revised higher to 1.6%, but remains the weakest print since Q4 of 2015. \"First quarter GDP paints a misleading picture of US economy’s vigour at the start of the year, and Q2 GDP will come as a timely reminder that the economy is now well passed its inflection point,\" Oxford Economics said, and the consultancy sees GDP growth around 2.0% in Q2, supported by robust consumer outlays while business investment, trade, and some inventory decumulation weigh on growth. It also says that, looking ahead, a reducing impact of fiscal stimulus, and the reduced business activity of late, combined with slower income momentum and cooling of global output could bring GDP growth to sub-2.0% in 2020, which Oxford Economics says would be close to the \"danger zone\" where it will be more exposed to potential crosscurrents; \"However, elevated private confidence, a healthy labour market, and three Fed rate cuts should ensure a soft landing, OxEco says.</p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>Pending home sales rose by 1.1% M/M in May, slightly above the Street's view for 1.0%; the Y/Y rate slipped to -0.8% in May from +0.4% in April. Pending home sales track contract signings rather than closings, and tend to lead the existing home sales data by 1-2 months, Goldman Sachs notes.</p><p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Ticked up to 227k from 217k. Desks attributed the expected jump to seasonal adjustment issues, and the headline could fall back to the 220k over the next few weeks, assuming no negative shocks from G20, or US/China trade. Pantheon expects claims to trend in a 210K to 220K range over the next few months, though the annual auto retooling shutdowns might trigger temporary chaos in July.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>As the nuclear deal seemingly disintegrates, IAEA data showed that the Middle East nation is on track to breaching the previously established cap of enriched uranium by this weekend. US Special Envoy to Iran Brian Hook said there will be consequences if Iran breaches the restrictions, and that the US is committed to policy of maximum economic pressure because it is working. Iran Foreign Minister Zarif said that the sanctions are not an alternative to war, rather that they are war and that a ‘short war’ with Iran is an illusion; this was in push back to previous Trump comments that the US would obliterate Iran. However, a separate Iranian official gave some less confrontational comments later, saying that the US wants talks but we are at an economic war, adding that there needs to be a ceasefire for talks to begin, a first stage would be the allowance of Iran to sell its own oil and receive the money from it. The official laid out some more Iranian conditions, which included Europeans either buying Iranian oil, or giving the money for oil to Iran, and the need of a return to export levels before the US sanctions were re-imposed.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLED USD 0.05 HIGHER AT USD 59.43; BRENT FUTURES (Q9) SETTLED USD 0.06 HIGHER AT USD 66.55: </strong>Crude markets have been consolidating on Thursday following Wednesday’s rally. Participants will be maintaining onto recent gains on the expectation of a rollover of supply cuts at the OPEC+ meeting next week. This seems a reasonable assumption given that both the Iraqi and Kuwaiti said spoke in favour of an extension of the cuts on Thursday, in addition to sceptical OPEC+ member Russia announcing it believes there will be a consolidated decision at the meeting. Separately, bulls remain validated by the risk of cargo travelling through the critical Strait of Hormuz due to Iranian tensions; It’s worth highlighting that WTI has been outperforming its European benchmark over the past month or so, with the WTI/Brent Arb narrowing by more than USD 4/bbl since mid-May and testing its YTD lows; part of this will be attributed to regular importers of Persian Gulf crude looking for alternative supply sources either due to the risk of transporting cargo through the region as well as making up for lost supply out of Iran due to the US sanctions, and in the meantime setting aside quality differences between the different crude grades.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.4% AT 2925, NASDAQ-100 0.4% AT 7657, DOW JONES -0.1% AT 26524. </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; -0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; 0.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS: </strong>Boeing (BA) weighed on indices as participants grew more pessimistic on the latest problems identified by the FAA on the 737 MAX fix, which saw renewed selling in later trade due to reports that up to three months would be needed to fix it. Walgreens (WBA) surged following a beat on top and bottom line estimates. Alternatively, earnings were less favourable for Conagra Brands (CAG) and Accenture (ACN), where Conagra missed both estimates, whilst lowering guidance, and Accenture reported disappointing new bookings. Goldman downgraded both Nordstrom (JWN) and Ross Stores (ROST) to Sell, seeing the two retailers come under pressure. Wedbush initiated coverage on several chipmakers, where Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) benefitted from Outperform ratings, whilst Intel (INTC) and Western Digital (WDC) traded lower thanks to Underperform ratings. Other stocks catching a bid on upgrades: CenturyLink (CTL) @ Wells Fargo; Owens Corning at BofA; TripAdvisor (TRIP) at DA Davidson. Travelers (TRV) was another notable downgrade, which sold off after Deutsche Bank reduced the insurer to Sell from Hold. Ford (F) was an outperformer amid being initiated with an Outperform at Credit Suisse, as well as announcing 12,000 job cuts in Europe by 2020. Twitter saw some brief downside on reports it will put warning labels on tweets from global leaders that violate its terms of service.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 11 TICKS HIGHER AT 127-30: </strong>Yields fell by around 4bps across the curve on Thursday, ahead of Friday’s G20 meeting, with major curve spreads undergoing modest narrowing of around 1bps. Weak ESI out of the Eurozone provided some impetus to the FI complex, and gains extended into the US open, after more woes at Boeing saw equity futures come under pressure. A WSJ article which was negative on trade developments allowed the upside to continue. Pending home sales data and hawkish remarks from Kudlow on trade allowed the bulls to continue to reign. The US 7-year auction stopped through the screens by 0.2bps, and cover improved though remained beneath the six auction average. The direct bid was strong, and the indirect bid subsequently eased a touch. The complex was near highs at settlement.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>Mexico’s central bank held rates at 8.25%, as expected, although one policymaker dissented (likely Gerardo Esquivel), calling for a 25bps rate cut. The Banxico tweaked its assessment of risks to growth and inflation; it now sees the balance of risks for growth as more uncertain, and has increased its downward bias, and on inflation, it said that some risks for inflation has diminished, while others have become more significant (previously, it viewed risks to inflation as to the upside). It also said that risks that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure from internal or external factors has risen. US tariff threat is another risk for inflation. “Overall, this is a dovish statement, and we think that the Banxico will continue to open the door for rate cuts,” Pantheon said, “assuming external conditions remain benign and AMLO maintains a market-friendly policy stance.” Pantheon argues that the Mexican economy is under pressure, and sees inflation continuing to fall in the second half of the year. “These factors, coupled with a dovish Fed, will allow Banxico to cut rates in Q3 or Q4,” it concludes.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Sentiment was generally positive (or optimistic, at the least), allowing AUD and NZD to rise, despite the latter seeing tumbling business confidence overnight, while the former may have been a result of favourable moves in rate differentials and a slight easing of RBA rate cuts pricing. DXY, EUR (upside surprise to German CPI raises risks of a firmer reading in the EZ aggregated data on Friday; the 200dma around 1.1346 is holding) and the JPY (decent retail sales overnight) are all essentially flat, indicating the cautious nature of trade ahead of Friday’s G20 meeting. However, there doesn’t seem to be a broad theme uniting all the FX moves, other than caution; low yielders, for instance, were still up (JPY was up against other FX, like the GBP; while the CHF is up more broadly; however, XAU flat), and NOK and SEK couldn’t make any ground against the EUR. GBP is slightly lower, backing away from the 1.27 consolidation area, despite a perceived softening in the stance of Boris Johnson on a hard Brexit. EMFX was mixed; although there was a concoction of bad news from Brazil (jobs data missed, BCB revised down growth view sharply, and cut inflation forecast; political woes are resurfacing for Bolsonaro, and additionally, the pension vote at the committee level was cancelled), but is positive; MXN weakened after the Banxico decision saw a dissenter, nodding to those who are looking for rate cuts later in the year.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY CPI: </strong>Ahead of the Eurozone-wide data due for release on Friday, German inflation was firmer than expected for the national measures, printing 1.6% Y/Y vs the consensus 1.4%. “We don’t see an estimate of core inflation in the advance report,” Pantheon says, “but we estimate that the national core rate rebounded to 1.6%, 0.3ppts higher than in May.” Looking ahead, the consultancy thinks the data is a good reflection of the underlying trend: “Headline inflation probably fall in coming months as the energy component slide further, but core inflation of 1.5-to-1.6% is representative, though risks are tilted to the upside in the next six-to-12 months due to strong wage growth and a still-tight labour market.” Pantheon notes that the core measure is very volatile on a monthly basis, so it could see some downside in July.</p><p><strong>* EUROPEAN SENTIMENT: </strong>ESI was weak, taking back the prior month’s rebound; the data was at odds with recent PMI data, and showed a weakening in services and industrial sentiment, while the business climate indicator and consumer metrics were weaker; the weakness was evident across the bloc.</p>",

Separately, bulls remain validated by the risk of cargo travelling through the critical Strait of Hormuz due to Iranian tensions; It’s worth highlighting that WTI has been outperforming its European benchmark over the past month or so, with the WTI/Brent Arb narrowing by more than USD 4/bbl since mid-May and testing its YTD lows; part of this will be attributed to regular importers of Persian Gulf crude looking for alternative supply sources either due to the risk of transporting cargo through the region as well as making up for lost supply out of Iran due to the US sanctions, and in the meantime setting aside quality differences between the different crude grades.</p>",

USD 72bln matures at the month-end settlement, implying USD 59bln of net cash will be raised, TD Securities says.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The last two 7-year note auctions have tailed, the last by a chunky 1.9bps on soft cover. The latest positioning data indicates dealers were long in the 6-7 year sector to the tune of around USD 22.6bln, a higher amount than the previous auction cycle, which could be a negative for the auction. SocGen’s analysts hold a slight negative going into the auction; the bank argued that the 7-year sector was trading rich vs 5s and 10s, and is trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The WI yield is also trading beneath all other stop out rates since October 2016, and SocGen says concession will therefore be needed heading into the auction.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/340b08d4-aaaf-4ac1-84e3-3c27f221e5b7.jpg\"></figure>",

In truth, Friday’s alignment of significant calendar dates does not appear to have impacted trade as much as portfolio models suggested given supposed ‘strong’ Usd selling to rebalance the books, not to mention equity switching into bonds in other asset classes. Indeed, the DXY is back midway between still tight 96.380-136 parameters.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars continue to defy dovish RBNZ and RBA outlooks and exchange leads at the top of the G10 table as the Kiwi flirts with 0.6700 and Aussie clipped 0.7000 in wake of positive news from China overnight as industrial firms returned to profit in May, while hopes are still erring towards some constructive developments between Presidents Xi and Trump on Saturday. On that note, a trade deal looks unlikely even though Trump suggested an accord is possible only yesterday, as Beijing has laid out terms that Washington will not grant, ie a balanced agreement, but adds that a truce is still feasible.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The next best major and perhaps benefiting most from the aforementioned rebalancing flows/positioning that one bank flags as particularly compelling vs the Loonie. Hence, Usd/Cad has retested bids/support closer to the next psychological level and round number down at 1.3100 irrespective of stalling oil prices.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>All relatively flat vs the Greenback, but with the Yen closer to 107.66 highs than 108.15 lows that came very close to the 21 DMA and amidst heightened expectations of a US-China trade accord alongside a speech from BoJ’s Wakatabe that intimated more stimulus in the offing given inflation nowhere near target and significant risk of the economy not sustaining a moderate rate of expansion. Meanwhile, the Franc has largely meandered between 0.9814-0.9768 and 1.1144-05 against the Euro, with the single currency unable build on initial post-German state CPI gains due to heavy option expiry interest stacked from 1.1330-35 through 1.1345-60 to 1.1400. Note, however, Eur/Usd is holding above the 200 DMA (1.1344) which may bode well technically in contrast to Cable that topped out in the low 1.2700+ area yet again and retreated through the big figure once a 1 bn expiry rolled off.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Real grabbed some regional headlines after reports that the Brazilian Pension Reform Bill vote was cancelled and a member of President Bolsonaro’s entourage apparently packed illegal substances to take to the G20. House speaker Mais subsequently stated that talks with Governors on the pension proposals will hopefully be completed next Tuesday, but Usd/Brl is still closer to the top of a 3.8725-8410 range. Conversely, the Lira pared some losses within 5.7920-7590 parameters after latest reports about the Turkish Finance Ministry looking to tap CBRT reserves to the tune of Usd8 bn, while the Government is also eyeing a circa 50% tax bracket for those earning Try1 mn+ and a 2 percentage point cut in corporate tax.</p>",

However, Bunds have maintained their recovery momentum and just registered another new positive Eurex high at 172.65 (+15 ticks vs -58 ticks at one stage) with extra impetus from national German CPI data that was not as firm as state reports implied. Meanwhile, Gilts have pared more losses from 130.04 to 130.50 vs yesterday’s 130.55 close and US Treasuries continue to flip/re-flatten ahead of 7 year supply, pending home sales and another regional manufacturing survey that could well extend the worrying trend.</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities have given up earlier gains [Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%]</strong> amid reports that Chinese President Xi is intending on presenting US President Trump with a set of terms that the US needs to meet before Beijing will be prepared to settle the trade dispute. Beijing is insisting that the U.S. removes its ban on the sale of U.S. technology to Huawei, according to a Chinese Official (which was noted earlier in the session by MOFCOM) whilst also asking for the removal of all punitive tariffs and for the US to drop its efforts to get China to buy more U.S. goods. Equity futures reacted negatively to the report as the conditions from China signal the gulf in demands between the two sides ahead of this weekend’s showdown. Germany’s DAX (-0.1%) is faring slightly better than its peers as the index heavyweight Bayer (+8.0%) surges amid reports of support from Elliott as the Co. reviews its legal strategy on weed killers. Sectors are mixed with some underperformance experienced in defensive sectors. In terms of individual movers, H&amp;M (+9.3%) shares spiked higher at the open following results in which Q2 sales rose 11%. Meanwhile, CHR Hansen (-12.2%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after cutting its revenue guidance.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - Not much deviation from established or recent ranges in major pairings, and the narrow DXY band (96.390-156) illustrates the subdued and cautious tone ahead of the eagerly awaited Summit in Osaka and US-China trade showdown. Indeed, there is still little sign of strong Dollar selling for month, quarter and half year end portfolio balancing purposes, although the Fed has intervened to an extent via Powell and Bullard’s efforts to manage dovish market expectations.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - The Aussie and Kiwi are still riding high on improved risk sentiment following some signs that relations between Washington and Beijing have cooled, albeit temporarily and conditionally pending the outcome of aforementioned G20 meeting where Presidents Trump and Xi will attempt to resolve issues that led to a breakdown in negotiations. Meanwhile, a welcome rebound in Chinese industrial profits has also lifted the mood down under, with Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd both within a whisker of big figures at 0.7000 and 0.6700 respectively, and the latter not unduly ruffled by a deterioration in ANZ’s NZ activity outlook overnight.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - The Pound is looking perky again as Cable reclaims the 1.2700 handle that has been tested several times this week, but proved unsustainable. Encouraging comments from Japan on the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK along TPP lines may be supporting Sterling that is also firmer vs the Euro (cross pivoting 0.8950), but a hefty 1bn option expiry at 1.2700 in Cable could still cap that pair.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/JPY/NOK</strong> - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and more confined, with the single currency remaining in a circa 1.1350-80 band and holding above key technical support in the form of the 200 DMA (1.1344) with the aid of firm-to-relatively frothy German state inflation data that puts an upside bias on the pan print consensus towards 1.6% from 1.4% and steady from the previous month. Conversely, the Loonie has lost some momentum ahead of 1.3100 due to a dip in oil prices, while the Franc pivots 0.9800 and Yen straddles 108.00 after dovish/downbeat remarks from BoJ’s Wakatabe. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Krona has retreated in wake of weaker than expected retail sales and the recoil in crude, with Eur/Nok back up around 9.6900.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Bucking the generally firmer regional trend, reports that Turkey is looking to syphon CBRT reserves have resurfaced and undermined the Lira alongside headlines about changes to tax policy, with Usd/Try up over 5.7900 at one stage.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Another downbeat session for bonds prior to tomorrow's G20 commencement, as general risk sentiment remains underpinned on President Trump's mainly constructive comments yesterday and notwithstanding most recent updates from China. On the latter, a WSJ piece says President Xi intends to present US President Trump with a set of terms, and notably that the US must lift all punitive tariffs. Prior to this, rhetoric stemming from China’s Commerce Ministry Spokesman Geng were also less encouraging as he claimed to be unaware of SCMP reports regarding a tentative trade deal; however, it's worth highlighting some discrepancy in the language used, as a ‘truce’ was cited. <strong>Bonds</strong> were largely unfazed on these comments, and more broadly <strong>USTs</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and Bunds remain largely towards the centre of ranges at 127-21, 130.21 and 172.36. Note, the Germany 10-year benchmark did see some mild reprieve after EZ sentiment indicators that printed softer across the board in contrast to German state CPIs. Returning to USTs, a more pronounced bounce recently as participants remain tentative ahead of this weekend’s aforementioned key risk events, and data in the form of the final GDP reading (Exp. unrevised at 3.1%), initial jobless claims before the USD 32bln 7yr auction which marks the last of the week's short-end supply; following last night's mixed 5 year sale (yield lowest since mid-2017, but softer cover and a tail).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are consolidating following this week’s geopolitics-inspired gains which were exacerbated by declining US stockpiles. WTI futures hovers around the USD 59/bbl level ahead of a cluster of DMA (50 DMA – 59.25, 100 DMA – 59.41 and 200 DMA 59.48) while its Brent counterpart trades just above the USD 65/bbl mark. On the OPEC+ front, Russia’s Energy Minister sounded somewhat upbeat in regard to reaching a consensus with Russia’s OPEC counterparts at next week’s meeting, adding that he will be meeting Saudi’s Energy Minister Al-Falih at the G20 this weekend. The energy producers will be heading into the meeting with full knowledge of the fallout from US-China talks. Market consensus is that a rollover of the current deal is the likely outlook (also mentioned by the Iraqi Oil Minister), although it is still not clear if any revisions will be made (Iraqi Oil Minister touted deeper cuts). Elsewhere, the <strong>gold</strong> rally has fizzled out as the DXY remains buoyed above 92.00, with the yellow metal now in close proximity to USD 1400/oz (vs. recent high of USD 1439/oz). Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices are little changed on the day ahead of the risk-packed weekend, with prices hovering just above USD 2.7/lb&nbsp; ahead of its 50 DMA at 2.73/lb. Finally, Dalian <strong>Iron</strong> ore has resumed its rally amid renewed concerns of tightening supply whilst Rebar steel continued its upwards trajectory amid pollution-related production curbs in China.</p>",

The 10 year UK benchmark has retreated further from this week’s contract best in line with core counterparts on the back of some pre-G20 optimism surrounding US-China trade and a degree of Fed massaging of overly dovish market expectations, while Bunds have also conceded ground in wake of considerably stronger German state CPI reports that infer a significant upside skew to the pan forecast for y/y inflation to hold at 1.4%. Note, the data prompted a break of the prior 172.02 wtd base, to 171.92, but not a clear breach of interim chart support around 171.94 that would expose a more concerted pull-back to 171.76 (50% retracement of the June move, thus far). Back to Liffe, Short Sterling futures are straddling parity again with a mildly steeper slant.</p>",

There was some downside in premarket trade, with a news organisation mis-quoting US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin (the headline suggested a trade deal with China was 90% done, although Mnuchin was referring to the agreement being 90% complete before talks between US/China broke off); there was buying action that followed from players who had identified the misquote. Analysts also attributed the miss in the durable goods data to some selling, too. US President Trump’s wide-ranging interview reiterated familiar themes (and risks) and led to a few positive ticks in the TPLEX. A mediocre 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps; direct bidders took the most since February, leaving dealers with the smallest share since February as well, the yield was the lowest at a 5s auction since August 2017</p><p><strong>US President Trump will meet with Russia President Putin on Friday at 1400 local time (0600BST), while President Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi on Saturday at 1130 local time (0330BST) in Osaka, according to a spokesman</strong>. <strong>(Newswires)</strong></p><p><strong>Fed's Daly (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said signs of persistent inflation drag would be concerning and might require policy makers to do more, while she noted that it is possible inflation expectations are drifting lower. Daly also commented the US economy is strong and tighter than it has been in a while but there might be more to run and that efforts to get inflation back to target could be appropriate, while the next few weeks will provide clarity on whether or not more stimulus is needed.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region manages to shrug off the uninspiring lead from Wall St where participants were tentative heading into the G20 and amid mixed US-China trade commentary. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is positive with outperformance in the energy sector just about keeping the index afloat following the recent bullish inventory data, while Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) is underpinned by the JPY-risk dynamic and with Japan Display front running the gains in Tokyo after reports that Apple will infuse USD 100mln into the Co. and also raise its orders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) inspired the turnaround in the region on several factors including the State Council’s announcement of measures to cut financing costs for smaller firms and with Industrial Profits back in the black, while the trade-related headlines were more constructive in which SCMP noted the US and China agreed a tentative truce before G20 summit and that US President Trump’s decision to delay additional tariffs was his counterparts price for holding this week's meeting with him.</p><p>In FX markets, most currencies remained in a holding pattern in anticipation of the G20 and although the DXY was slightly firmer overnight, price action was contained to within this week’s tight ranges. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD subdued and GBP/USD retreating from resistance at 1.2700, while antipodeans have fared better after the improved Chinese profits with AUD/USD eyeing the 0.7000 level to the upside and with NZD/USD stable despite poor Business Confidence data. USD/JPY attempts to reclaim the 108.00 handle and JPY-crosses are also underpinned as the brightened risk tone spurred safe-haven outflows and following comments from BoJ Deputy Governor Wakatabe who sang from the same hymn sheet as Kuroda and was in praise of the merits of QQE.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with demand dampened by the improved risk sentiment and with participants sidelined ahead of a 2yr auction later.</p>",
