        "content": "<p>The RBNZ will announce its latest rate decision on Wednesday morning in which expectations are unanimous for the central bank to maintain the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% where it has been since November 2016, with markets pricing in a 98.95% probability for no change in rates.</p><p>The one-sided expectations for no policy changes continue to be supported by the rhetoric from the central bank as it reiterated at the last meeting that it expects to keep the cash rate at the current level through to 2020 and that the next direction could be up or down. Furthermore, RBNZ Governor Orr stated at the MPS press conference that the RBNZ will keep the OCR at an expansionary level for a considerable period of time and that the chance of a rate cut has not increased, which was is in contrast of the recent dovish shifts seen in other major central banks. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that Governor Orr has suggested that a future rate cut is not ruled out as a possibility despite his best guess is for rates to be on hold for a long period and the RBNZ also recently suggested its proposed bank capital increase could eventually lead to a rate cut.</p><p>The recent data points from New Zealand have been mixed in which Trade Balance in February was at a surprise surplus as Exports topped estimates, although the Business Outlook survey further deteriorated. In addition, GDP figures for Q4 were also varied in which Q/Q GDP printed 0.6% as expected and with Y/Y GDP at 2.3% vs. Exp. 2.5% to match the weakest growth since 2015. However, the soft readings aren’t expected to trigger action from the RBNZ and the currency was even supported from the Q4 growth numbers as the figures were better than some had feared and as market watchers took solace from the improvement in the Q/Q release vs. Prev. 0.3% growth in Q3.</p><p>The announcement is due at 0100GMT and as a hold in rates is seen as a forgone conclusion, focus will turn to the statement if there is any deviation to the central bank’s outlook of keeping rates unchanged through to 2020. As a reminder, there will not be an MPS press conference for today’s meeting and it will also be the last before its Monetary Policy Committee Charter takes effect in which decision making will be conducted by a Monetary Policy Committee that will seek to reach a consensus on its decision and if not, conduct a vote with the Governor to have a casting vote if needed.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>- ANZ Bank expects RBNZ to move further in a dovish direction as the year progresses and growth undershoots their projections, while it continues to forecast an OCR cut by year end.</li><li>- ASB expect RBNZ to signal its intent to hold the OCR at low levels for a considerable period and retain the flexibility to either hike or cut.</li><li>- Capital Economics expects RBNZ to maintain a neutral stance following soft GDP and for the central bank to remain on hold till late 2021.</li></ul>",

Real money reportedly scooped up intermediates, and range trading ensued as dealers sold into supply and there was some rate locking on investment grade issuance including an 8-tranche bond offering from Mars Inc, IGM said. Uninspiring US data helped contribute some positive ticks. The 2yr note auction was decent, stopping through the screens by 1.2bps; cover was above recent averages. The decent auction helped stabilise the TPLEX, but subdued trade resumed into the close. Once again, a lot of attention on the 3m/10yr curve, which remains inverted, though analysts have seemingly become more sanguine about the whole affair: \"The significance of an inverted yield curve continues to be hotly debated but there’s clearly a consensus that 1) the curve needs to be ‘properly’ inverted to be a recession indicator and 2) on average there’s a big lag, of over a year, between inversion and recession,\" SocGen's strategists said. \"I’ve always struggled with the fascination with inversion, because the curve inversion really tells us that rates are about to peak. That there is usually a recession a year or so after Fed Funds have peaked, isn’t exactly earth-shattering.\" The strategists add that Fed Funds futs are pricing no chance of hikes in the next year, with an 80% chance of a cut, so we shouldn't be too surprised about some forecasts of a recession in 2020 (not yet the consensus view), nor should we expect markets to position for recession this far in advance, SocGen said. US T-note futures settled 2+ ticks higher at 124-13.</p>",

According to analysis by Oxford Economics, this was mainly caused by a fall in the present situation index, which fell 12.2 points, the largest drop since December 2008. Consumers viewed business conditions to have worsened; one-third judged business conditions to be 'good' down from 40% in February. Consumers also viewed the labour market to have deteriorated, with the share of people judging jobs to be 'hard to get' rising 2 basis points (to 13.7%). The expectations index held up better, falling 4 points, suggesting that consumer spending growth should remain solid albeit continuing to cool in the months ahead. This reading is at odds with the preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading which came in above expectations on the 15th March. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the present situation index tends to track the unemployment rate (as unemployment decreases, consumer sentiment improves) but has been overshooting in the last two years. As such, it says that a correction (as we have seen) does not necessarily indicate the start of a sustained downtrend and consumer confidence remains at historic highs.</p><p><strong>* US HOUSING STARTS/BUILDING PERMITS:</strong> US housing starts were 1.162mln in Fed, short of the 1.213mln consensus; building permits also missed at 1.296mln vs a consensus 1.3mln. The fall in housing starts reverses the bounce seen in January; all of the swing was in single-family starts, Wells Fargo noted, which it said are more susceptible to swings in the weather. Accordingly, Wells says that we shouldn't read too much into the drop. The bank points to the Jan data, which showed that when the weather cleared up, start responded positively. The bank says that building permits offer a better assessment of the housing market; most of the decline in this metric was on the back of multi-family units; single-family homes were unchanged, and Wells thinks they appear to be bottoming following a slide that began in August. \"We feel that is a fairly accurate assessment of where the housing market is today,\" Wells Fargo writes, \"the Fed's pivot on monetary policy has arrested the slide in housing starts but has not reversed it.\" It points out that the run-up in interest rates last year \"did some real damage to financial markets and the economy, which is weighing on both potential buyers and builders.\" The bank adds that even with the recent slide in interest rates, which reflects weakening economic conditions, \"we do not feel we will see a rebound in housing demand until the storm clouds emanating from slower global economic growth clear later this year.\"</p><p><strong>* FED</strong>: <strong>Fed's Rosengren (voter)</strong> said the balance sheet was likely to form a key part of the central bank's strategy in the next downturn, and the Fed would likely shorten the maturity of its Treasury holdings in good times, and then lengthen the duration during times of economic challenges. Rosengren reiterated data-dependence. <strong>Fed's Daly (non-voter)</strong> said US labour market performance is nothing short of extraordinary; on inflation, she stated that Fed has not sustainably met its 2% inflation goal, and must be vigilant about falling inflation expectations. <strong>Harker (non-voter)</strong> reiterated data dependence.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Following the vote in favour of the Letwin amendment on Monday evening, UK Members of Parliament will now vote on a range of indicative votes tomorrow, indicative meaning non-legally binding, in efforts to have the house guide the Brexit process; options that are put to the ballot will be selected by HoC speaker Bercow and consequentially all voted on simultaneously. RBC highlight that a majority of MPs are “in favour of a ‘softer’ form of Brexit,” but, “PM May has suggested beforehand that some options might be difficult to deliver and that she might not feel bound by them.” At the time of writing, there have been motions proposed which would compel the government to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union after&nbsp; the UK departs; a motion in favour of an EEA-EFTA Norway option, which appears to have cross-party support; a motion to revoke Article 50 if a no-deal scenario ensues; a motion which advocates for a common market; and a Brexiteer favoured no-deal motion. Other key motions expected are the existing PM May deal, which influential Brexiteer Boris Johnson is reportedly edging towards over fears that if not passed, there will be no Brexit at all.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW – RBNZ: </strong>RBNZ expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.75%. Policy announcement due at 0100GMT/2000CDT/0900HKT. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21461/download\">Click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 1.12 HIGHER AT USD 59.94/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.76 HIGHER AT USD 67.97/BBL. </strong>Energy prices treaded higher on Tuesday ahead of API energy inventory data, released after the bell. Prices were on the front-foot in the European session, supported by a more friendly risk environment. OPEC+ has homed in on a date for their next technical meeting, with May 19th in Saudi Arabia currently pencilled in, fuelling hopes for bulls of extended cooperation for supply cuts. However, Citigroup analysts highlight that today’s upswing seems to contradict today’s economic data, with “both lower-than-expected February housing starts and an unexpected drop in a prominent index of consumer confidence,” the bank goes on to say that RBOB gasoline futures, which expire Friday, and option expiration of April heating oil are likely to have fed into some of the volatility in the energy complex. Separately, the oil rich, Venezuela experienced another nationwide electricity blackout, likely to be supportive of front month futures due to short-term supply concerns as it struggles to operate its wells. The market is looking ahead to this evening’s weekly inventory data from the API, where the market will be attentive to whether US crude stocks can continue to exhibit (large) draws in a time where the market expects builds, due to it being maintenance season for refiners; some market participants speculate that this could be the new norm as the US tends towards the position of a net-exporter of the black gold, a growing trend ever since the US lifted the ban of oil exports a few years back, which is gradually causing a shift in previous seasonal expectations made in a closed economy. Ahead of the release, expectations are for crude stocks to draw 1.2mln bbls; both of the products are seen drawing too, gasoline by 2.8mln and distillates 0.9mln. Genscape sees Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub building 0.3mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.72% at 2818, NDX +0.47% at 7351, DJI +0.55% at 25658. SECTORS: Energy +1.44%, Materials +0.57%, Industrials +0.70%, Cons Discretionary +0.44%, Cons Staples +0.85%, Healthcare +0.68%, Financials +1.13%, Tech +0.56%, Telecoms +0.45%, Utilities +0.70%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Viacom (VIAB) surged on Tuesday, where it caught an initial bid on the open on the back of merger talks resuming with CBS (CBS), which also outperformed, and then again later on after it affirmed its outlook following its licensing agreement with AT&amp;T (T). Biogen (BIIB) drifted higher after benefitting from a positive mention at Piper Jaffray. Carnival (CCL) nosedived after reporting a gloomy profit outlook. Apple (AAPL) benefitted on the open from a collection of price target raises across research houses after its Showcase event on Monday put it head-on-head with Netflix (NFLX), which alternatively underperformed; Disney (DIS), which will run alongside the Apple TV+ service, traded at the top of the Dow too. Tesla (TSLA) opened higher after it was exonerated from a two-year old investor lawsuit made against it in regard to misleading Model 3 information. Nvidia (NVDA) lifted the semiconductor sector after an Overweight initiation at Piper Jaffray. Qualcomm (QCOM) caught a mid-session surge after a US trade judge determined Apple infringed one of its patents, and recommended some iPhone import bans. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) caught a late session bid after the DoJ antitrust chief gave supportive comments on their merger deal.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 124-13. </strong>Soft European data helped put a floor beneath prices in early trade, though a constructive risk environment helped stocks move higher, seeing some selling. Real money reportedly scooped up intermediates, and range trading ensued as dealers sold into supply and there was some rate locking on investment grade issuance including an 8-tranche bond offering from Mars Inc, IGM said. Uninspiring US data helped contribute some positive ticks. The 2yr note auction was decent, stopping through the screens by 1.2bps; cover was above recent averages. The decent auction helped stabilise the TPLEX, but subdued trade resumed into the close. Once again, a lot of attention on the 3m/10yr curve, which remains inverted, though analysts have seemingly become more sanguine about the whole affair: \"The significance of an inverted yield curve continues to be hotly debated but there’s clearly a consensus that 1) the curve needs to be ‘properly’ inverted to be a recession indicator and 2) on average there’s a big lag, of over a year, between inversion and recession,\" SocGen's strategists said. \"I’ve always struggled with the fascination with inversion, because the curve inversion really tells us that rates are about to peak. That there is usually a recession a year or so after Fed Funds have peaked, isn’t exactly earth-shattering.\" The strategists add that Fed Funds futs are pricing no chance of hikes in the next year, with an 80% chance of a cut, so we shouldn't be too surprised about some forecasts of a recession in 2020 (not yet the consensus view), nor should we expect markets to position for recession this far in advance, SocGen said.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> USD slightly higher, rebounding following a couple of days concerns about the growth outlook; housing data did little to aid the bid, neither did consumer confidence. Perhaps the EUR was helpong, following downbeat German and French data, pinning bund yields down. A relatively quiet day for GBP, ahead of Wednesday's indicative votes in Parliament, seeing the pound head into APAC trade holding above 1.32. JPY caught a bid after positive equity sentiment, while there were bouts of steepening between JGB/Tsys yields, supporting. EMFX gave back some of the gains, mainly on a firmer buck, though a few domestic factors played a role. Antipodes tracked risk sentiment, though the NZD is underperforming ahead of RBNZ rate decision.</p>",

Prices were on the front-foot in the European session, supported by a more friendly risk environment. OPEC+ has homed in on a date for their next technical meeting, with May 19th in Saudi Arabia currently pencilled in, fuelling hopes for bulls of extended cooperation for supply cuts. However, Citigroup analysts highlight that today’s upswing seems to contradict today’s economic data, with “both lower-than-expected February housing starts and an unexpected drop in a prominent index of consumer confidence,” the bank goes on to say that RBOB gasoline futures, which expire Friday, and option expiration of April heating oil are likely to have fed into some of the volatility in the energy complex. Separately, the oil rich, Venezuela experienced another nationwide electricity blackout, likely to be supportive of front month futures due to short-term supply concerns as it struggles to operate its wells. The market is looking ahead to this evening’s weekly inventory data from the API, where the market will be attentive to whether US crude stocks can continue to exhibit (large) draws in a time where the market expects builds, due to it being maintenance season for refiners; some market participants speculate that this could be the new norm as the US tends towards the position of a net-exporter of the black gold, a growing trend ever since the US lifted the ban of oil exports a few years back, which is gradually causing a shift in previous seasonal expectations made in a closed economy. Ahead of the release, expectations are for crude stocks to draw 1.2mln bbls; both of the products are seen drawing too, gasoline by 2.8mln and distillates 0.9mln. Genscape sees Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub building 0.3mln bbls.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* TREASURY SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 131bln in 2yr (USD 40bln Tue), 5yr (USD 41bln, Wed), 7yr (USD 32bln, Thu), and an FRN (USD 18bln, Wed). USD &nbsp;71.5bln matured at the month-end settlement, implying the Treasury will raise a net USD 59.5bln in new supply. USD 22.4bln of Fed holdings mature at the month-end settlement, and the Fed will add-on USD 7.9bln to 2yr, USD 8.1bln to 5yr, and USD 6.3bln to 7yr. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FOMC: </strong>Last week's FOMC meeting was more dovish than anticipated, with the Fed announcing that it will slow the balance sheet run-off in May, ending in September, and reducing caps on monthly redemptions to USD 15bln, from USD 30bln; it will also be reinvesting MBS coupons back into Treasuries. \"With runoff ending in September, we think that Treasury will likely cut coupon auction sizes later this year (potentially focused in the 2-3y sector). Runoff ending in September will decrease Treasury issuance by about $100bn compared with runoff continuing throughout the year,\" TD Securities says. \"The Fed will have to reinvest MBS paydowns in the open market starting in October. Starting in Q4 2020, we look for the Fed to purchase additional Treasuries in the open market to offset the growth in currency in circulation.\" &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The last auction saw demand ease a touch, though the auction saw a second consecutive stop through the screens. \"Four of the last five auctions have stopped through underscoring the recent strength in performance,\" Barclays writes, \"after the December auction tailed amid elevated market volatility and balance sheet pressures toward the end of 2018.\" Indirect takedown fell at the last auction, however, likely on the back of the decline in domestic investor takedown, while foreign investors have been steadily taking down less over the last four auctions. Some desks also argue that with BCN ending later this year, as well as the potential for the Treasury to cut sizes in the 2-3yr sectors, 2s might begin to trade bettwe against OIS. Looking ahead, Barclays says that \"at current yields, the WI issue is a potential CTD in TUM9, assuming a 2.375% coupon. However, yields are at the cusp of a coupon shift. If yields decline and the coupon shifts to 2.25%, a seasoned 7y note (2.25s of Mar 21s) will be reopened. <strong>Six auction averages: High-yield 2.711%, cover 2.52x, tail 0.2bps; dealers &nbsp;39.6%, directs 14.7%, indirects 45.7%.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/63ef71a5-a65e-40c0-bf16-52d964127423.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Ending a volatile session at the bottom of the G10 pile and in ascending order based on safe-haven appeal or status against the backdrop of a recovery in broad risk appetite. Hence, Usd/Jpy has been the biggest mover, and following a clean break of 110.00 the headline pair climbed through hefty 110.10-15 expiry options, a 110.23 Fib and 110.50 on the way to 110.68. The Franc also drifted down against the Dollar to circa 0.9950 from just over 0.9920 at one stage, but held its own vs the Euro within a 1.1222-48 range as the single currency topped out ahead of 1.1330 vs the Greenback and relinquished the 1.1300 handle to a circa 1.1280 low. However, Eur/Usd derived some technical support/encouragement from the fact that last Friday’s low (around 1.1273) held and rebounded towards the figure again.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The biggest beneficiary of the aforementioned revival in risk sentiment, and not far from triggering decent Aud/Usd option expiry interest between 0.7145-50 at the NY cut, with additional impetus coming from defensive <strong>NZD </strong>positioning ahead of the overnight RBNZ policy meeting. Indeed, the Aud/Nzd cross traded back above 1.0300 even though the Kiwi remained relatively firm vs its US counterpart in a 0.6895-0.6925 band after better than expected NZ trade data, as exports beat consensus and imports marginally missed. Back to the impending RBNZ, Ransquawk’s detailed primer is available via the Research Suite and according to options pricing the break-even is roughly 46 pips for the event.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound has been buffeted by Brexit headlines yet again as the latest HoC vote seized the initiative away from UK PM May and set the wheels in motion for indicative votes on Wednesday – see our headline feed for the latest status update, analysis and preview of what comes next. Cable has rotated around the 1.3200 axis in a full point circle, while Eur/Gbp has reverberated from 0.8595 to 0.8520 amidst all the reports, commentary and media articles on various scenarios and what ifs, including a potential 3rd MV on Thursday.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>A decent Tuesday for the Loonie, thus far, as Usd/Cad retreated through 1.3400 towards 1.3370 on the back of a firm bounce in crude prices and China’s decision to relax some restrictions on canola from Canada.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns have both rallied and revelled in the more risk positive environment with oil another bullish factor for the Nok and Riksbank’s Skingsley acknowledging the possibility that the Swedish economy may slow further, but also pointing out that survey responses show domestic firms are not that downbeat about the outlook. Eur/Nok is now testing 9.6250 and Eur/Sek 10.4100.</p><p><strong>TRY</strong></p><p>Not necessarily the most active EM unit, but still in the spotlight as the squeeze on rates continues and the Lira rebounds further from recent lows to 5.4280 at one stage. Conversely, the&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HUF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>got a fleeting boost from the NBH’s overnight deposit rate hike (+10 bp), but then retreated within a circa 3.1560-3.1900 range as Governor Matolcsy stated that the move is not the start of a tightening cycle and CPI has hit target.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European indices are slightly firmer [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.3%]</strong> roughly in-line with how they started the session, in-spite of indices drifting somewhat into mixed/negative territory not long after the open. In a similar pattern, after opening the session all in the green, major sectors are now mixed, with some mild outperformance seen in Energy names. The FTSE 100 (+0.3%) is firmer, boosted by the likes of Ocado (+4.3%) after signing a deal with Australian supermarket chain Coles at the top of the index alongside housing names such as Persimmon (+2.3%) and Fresnillo (+1.2%) after positive broker moves. However, the FTSE 100’s gains are hampered by the significant underperformance seen in Ferguson (-9.0%) shares after the Co. warned that FY profit will be towards the lower end of expectations. Other notable movers include, Airbus (+2.4%) after reports just before 16:00GMT yesterday that they had secured an order from China at which Co. shares moved higher and Boeing shares saw some negativity. Subsequently, further details have emerged that the deal is for 300 jets with an estimated value of around USD 35bln; which is almost double the level that had been indicated by French President Macron in 2018. Elsewhere, Rolls Royce (-1.8%) who are in negative territory after being reiterated underweight at Morgan Stanley. Of note for tech names Samsung Electronics (005930 KS) guides Q1 earnigns to be lower than market expectations. <i>For reference Co. shares closed around 0.6% lower.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Greenback remains rangebound and mixed vs G10 counterparts, as the DXY pivots the 96.500 level with technical resistance capping the upside along with month end rebalancing signals pointing to moderate to modest selling vs several major currencies. However, the Buck is also underpinned ahead of 96.000 amidst relative weakness elsewhere, such as the Yen on improving or more stable risk sentiment, Pound on Brexit and Kiwi pre-RBNZ.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> As noted above, an upturn of recovery in risk appetite has prompted an unwind in safe-haven premiums to the detriment of the Yen in particular, and after recent strengthening through 110.00 vs the Usd the headline pair has now rebounded quite markedly through the big figure and a Fib at 110.23 to trip some stops on the way to 110.42. Note, a hefty 1.8 bn option expiry between 110.10-15 for today’s NY cut appears safe at the current juncture.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP -</strong> Also back under pressure vs the Usd having forged gains on the back of better than forecast NZ trade data in the case of the Kiwi and for Sterling the latest vote in UK Parliament that effectively takes the onus away from PM May in terms of the next Brexit steps. Nzd/Usd is hovering around 0.6900 vs circa 0.6925 at best overnight, while Cable retreated from around 1.3225 to a 1.3160 base again (virtually matching Monday’s low) before rebounding firmly over 1.3200 handle to 1.3250. Note, next up for the Kiwi is March’s RBNZ policy meeting (full preview flagged on the headline feed and within the Research Suite), while the Pound remains hostage to Brexit and will be eyeing Wednesday’s indicative votes.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/EUR -</strong> All nudging new or nestling near highs vs the Usd, as the Aussie extends above 0.7100 with some favourable tailwinds via the Aud/Nzd cross that has rebounded firmly over 1.0300 amidst the aforementioned pre-RBNZ Kiwi caution. However, Aud/Usd still has some way to go from 0.7135 to arouse any expiry related interest from 1 bn rolling off from 0.7145 to 0.7150. Meanwhile, the Loonie is trying to extend gains above 1.3400 against the backdrop of firm oil prices and news that China has lifted some bans on Candian canola imports, and the single currency is sitting above 1.1300, albeit tight.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> A more stable session so far for the TRY and some outperformance vs regional peers as the Lira continues to pare recent heavy losses, albeit due to intervention or various forms of capital repatriation and amidst further spikes in money market rates. Usd/Try currently near the middle of a 5.4660-5.5925 band. Elsewhere, Eur/Huf is also midway between trading parameters (316.80-00) ahead of a widely anticipated NBH rate hike</p><p>New Zealand Trade Balance (Feb) M/M 12M vs. Exp. -200M (Prev. -914M, Rev. -948M).

Bunds are also back down near lows within a 165.50-83 range and US Treasuries are succumbing to more acute bear steepening also evident across the Eurodollar strip as the broader risk backdrop improves.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>A firm rebound in the energy complex with WTI and Brent futures advancing further above USD 59.00/bbl and USD 67.50/bbl respectively</strong> as global growth pessimism takes a back seat (for now) and risk appetite takes the wheel. OPEC+ members are said to be planning the next JMMC meeting on May 19th after cancelling their April assembly before OPEC+ convenes on June 25-26. ING argues that the cancellation of the April meeting could suggest that the members “are not in agreement to extend the current deal”, set to last until the end of H1 2019. Analysts at ING also speculate that if this is the case, then it is likely that Russia believes an extension is not needed. Nonetheless, traders will be eyeing the usual API crude inventory release later today (2030 GMT/1530 ET) as a fresh catalyst. Elsewhere, metals are relatively mixed with gold (-0.6%) shedding recent gains amid the broad risk appetite whilst copper prices are supported for the same reason. Back to precious metals, UBS raised its 6 and 12-month silver forecasts, both to USD 16.30/oz from USD 15.50/oz and USD 16.00/oz respectively.</p><p>BHP expects to resume loading iron ore ships at Port Hedland on Tuesday and ramp up output over the approaching days, while it found no major damage from the recent cyclone.

In a similar pattern, after opening the session all in the green, major sectors are now mixed, with some mild outperformance seen in Energy names. The FTSE 100 (+0.2%) is firmer, boosted by the likes of Ocado (+4.3%) after signing a deal with Australian supermarket chain Coles at the top of the index alongside housing names such as Persimmon (+2.3%) and Fresnillo (+1.2%) after positive broker moves. However, the FTSE 100’s gains are hampered by the significant underperformance seen in Ferguson (-9.0%) shares after the Co. warned that FY profit will be towards the lower end of expectations. Other notable movers include, Airbus (+2.4%) after reports just before 16:00GMT yesterday that they had secured an order from China at which Co. shares moved higher and Boeing shares saw some negativity. Subsequently, further details have emerged that the deal is for 300 jets with an estimated value of around USD 35bln; which is almost double the level that had been indicated by French President Macron in 2018. Elsewhere, Rolls Royce (-1.8%) who are in negative territory after being reiterated underweight at Morgan Stanley.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Greenback remains rangebound and mixed vs G10 counterparts, as the DXY pivots the 96.500 level with technical resistance capping the upside along with month end rebalancing signals pointing to moderate to modest selling vs several major currencies. However, the Buck is also underpinned ahead of 96.000 amidst relative weakness elsewhere, such as the Yen on improving or more stable risk sentiment, Pound on Brexit and Kiwi pre-RBNZ.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong> - As noted above, an upturn of recovery in risk appetite has prompted an unwind in safe-haven premiums to the detriment of the Yen in particular, and after recent strengthening through 110.00 vs the Usd the headline pair has now rebounded quite markedly through the big figure and a Fib at 110.23 to trip some stops on the way to 110.42. Note, a hefty 1.8 bn option expiry between 110.10-15 for today’s NY cut appears safe at the current juncture.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP</strong> - Also back under pressure vs the Usd having forged gains on the back of better than forecast NZ trade data in the case of the Kiwi and for Sterling the latest vote in UK Parliament that effectively takes the onus away from PM May in terms of the next Brexit steps. Nzd/Usd is hovering around 0.6900 vs circa 0.6925 at best overnight, while Cable retreated from around 1.3225 to a 1.3160 base again (virtually matching Monday’s low) before rebounding firmly over 1.3200 handle to 1.3250. Note, next up for the Kiwi is March’s RBNZ policy meeting (full preview flagged on the headline feed and within the Research Suite), while the Pound remains hostage to Brexit and will be eyeing Wednesday’s indicative votes.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/EUR</strong> - All nudging new or nestling near highs vs the Usd, as the Aussie extends above 0.7100 with some favourable tailwinds via the Aud/Nzd cross that has rebounded firmly over 1.0300 amidst the aforementioned pre-RBNZ Kiwi caution. However, Aud/Usd still has some way to go from 0.7135 to arouse any expiry related interest from 1 bn rolling off from 0.7145 to 0.7150. Meanwhile, the Loonie is trying to extend gains above 1.3400 against the backdrop of firm oil prices and news that China has lifted some bans on Candian canola imports, and the single currency is sitting above 1.1300, albeit tight.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - A more stable session so far for the TRY and some outperformance vs regional peers as the Lira continues to pare recent heavy losses, albeit due to intervention or various forms of capital repatriation and amidst further spikes in money market rates. Usd/Try currently near the middle of a 5.4660-5.5925 band. Elsewhere, Eur/Huf is also midway between trading parameters (316.80-00) ahead of a widely anticipated NBH rate hike.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Very volatile trade in <strong>Gilts</strong> amidst even more fluid and fluctuating Brexit headlines, but ultimately the 10 year UK benchmark has reversed to trade near a fresh 122.22 Liffe low (-29 ticks), as perceptions move towards PM May perhaps getting more support for the WA via previous staunch opposers ERG. <strong>Bunds</strong> are also back down near lows within a 165.50-83 range and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are succumbing to more acute bear steepening also evident across the Eurodollar strip as the broader risk backdrop improves.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A firm rebound in the energy complex with WTI and Brent futures advancing further above USD 59.00/bbl and USD 67.50/bbl respectively</strong> as global growth pessimism takes a back seat (for now) and risk appetite takes the wheel. OPEC+ members are said to be planning the next JMMC meeting on May 19th after cancelling their April assembly before OPEC+ convenes on June 25-26. ING argues that the cancellation of the April meeting could suggest that the members “are not in agreement to extend the current deal”, set to last until the end of H1 2019. Analysts at ING also speculate that if this is the case, then it is likely that Russia believes an extension is not needed. Nonetheless, traders will be eyeing the usual API crude inventory release later today (2030 GMT/1530 ET) as a fresh catalyst. Elsewhere, metals are relatively mixed with gold (-0.6%) shedding recent gains amid the broad risk appetite whilst copper prices are supported for the same reason. Back to precious metals, UBS raised its 6 and 12-month silver forecasts, both to USD 16.30/oz from USD 15.50/oz and USD 16.00/oz respectively.</p>",

Back to Liffe, Gilts have recovered some lost ground alongside a firmer rebound in Bunds to 165.83 vs 165.50 at worst and their 165.66 previous close to trade at 129.42 from 129.25 and the 129.51 close, while the 3 month strip is 0.5 to 1.5 ticks adrift within a flat/+1 to -2 tick range.</p>",

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>UK Parliament voted (327 vs. 300) to approve government motion which included the Letwin amendment (A) of taking control of Parliament time to hold indicative votes on Brexit options</strong>. This was after MPs voted (329 vs. 302) in favour of the Letwin amendment A which seeks to change the rules of parliament on March 27 in order to provide time for lawmakers to debate and hold indicative votes. Furthermore, <strong>MPs voted (311 vs. 314) against the Beckett amendment (F) which called on the government to seek parliament approval on a no-deal</strong> <strong>if there is an agreement is not reached 1 week to Brexit date</strong>, while the <strong>Labour amendment (D) to provide parliamentary time for lawmakers to find a majority for a different approach on Brexit was not moved</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>The Brexit Ministry said the Letwin amendment upends balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent, while it added that any options put forward by Parliament must be deliverable in negotiations with EU. <strong>In related news, 3 junior ministers resigned in order to vote for the Letwin amendment</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK Brexit Secretary Barclay said the government will return to parliament if Brexit deal is not approved this week</strong>, while there were separate comments from UK Cabinet Office Minister Lidington that a further extension possibility is dependent on what parliament decides to do this week on Brexit.

(BuzzFeed/Twitter)</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, price action left much to be desired with the <strong>DXY</strong> stuck around the 96.50 level as most major currencies traded rangebound overnight. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was little changed at the weaker end of the 1.1300 handle near an option expiry for today’s New York cut and in the midst of several key DMA levels circa 1.1310-47. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was also flat despite mild support after UK MPs voted in favour to approve the government motion including the Letwin amendment A which was against government wishes and saw 3 junior minsters resign to support the effort to take control of the Brexit process in Parliament. Elsewhere, antipodeans marginally extended on Monday’s gains with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also propped up by a surprise Trade Surplus and better than expected Exports data, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> initially benefitted amid the risk appetite but was capped by technical levels around 110.00 and as strength in some of the Asia-Pac bourses began to wane.</p><p>New Zealand Trade Balance (Feb) M/M 12M vs. Exp. -200M (Prev. -914M, Rev. -948M). (Newswires) New Zealand Exports (Feb) 4.82B vs. Exp. 4.70B (Prev. 4.40B, Rev. 4.33B) New Zealand Imports (Feb) 4.80B vs. Exp. 4.90B (Prev. 5.32B, Rev. 5.28B)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which WTI crude futures benefitted from the improved risk appetite and reclaimed the USD 59/bbl level but with gains limited as relevant news flow for oil remained light and with participants turning attention to the latest inventory data kicking off with this evening’s APIs. Elsewhere, gold prices pared back some of the prior day’s gains as the recovery in Asia-Pac stocks dampened safe-haven appetite, while copper extended on this week’s sideways trade as mineral mining operations in Australia begin to resume post-cyclone and as copper’s largest buyer China underperformed its regional peers.</p><p>BHP expects to resume loading iron ore ships at Port Hedland on Tuesday and ramp up output over the approaching days, while it found no major damage from the recent cyclone. (Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>The Treasury complex saw another bout of bull-flattening, with the 3m/10yr spread inverting further to -7bps at one point in US trade, which put the equity complex on the defensive (analysts at Nomura have suggested this could explain some of the price action late on Friday); during that episode, 10-year yields also fell below the effective Fed Funds Rate (at 2.41%), and markets were pricing around a 75% chance that the Fed would CUT rates this year (it was 25% before the FOMC meeting last week). Today's moves - like Friday's - are being attributed to the FOMC dovishness, which is likely to be echoed in Fedspeak through the course of the week. There has been heightened attention on its implications, and specifically, what it portends for the future performance of the US economy, given that the 3m/10y part of the curve inverted aead of recessions in 2007/09, 2001, and the 1990/1 recession; it also inverted in 1998 slightly, and at the end of 1995 though the economy continued to grow. Traders have been passing around the SF Fed's analysis on yield curve spreads, penned last August, which concluded that \"the traditional 10y–3m spread is the most reliable predictor (of recession), and we do not find any evidence that would support discarding this long-standing benchmark as a measure of the shape of the yield curve. US T-note futures (M9) settled 9+ ticks higher at 124-10+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Rosengren (voter, hawk)</strong> said returning Fed assets to pre-crisis levels is not desirable nor feasible and that the balance sheet is likely to grow, while he added that it may be important to increase share of Treasury bills as well as lower duration of balance sheet more quickly. Furthermore, Rosengren noted that Fed pause is the responsible action to do now and that the dot plot is not a promise of policy direction which depends on changes to the economy. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> - hosted its Showtime event today, where it unveiled its expected streaming service, still with no price indication, which will included Amazon (AMZN) Prime content. Apple also unveiled: a new gaming service Apple Arcade, weighing on competitors (ATVI, EA); a new payment service “Apple Card” in collaboration with Goldman (GS) and Mastercard (MA); Apple News service for USD 9.99/month. (Newswires) Co. shares closed lower by 1.2% (S&amp;P 500 closed lower by 0.08%)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region took the consolidation on Wall St as a cue to pick itself up from the prior day’s drastic sell-off. ASX 200 (Unch) is choppy as weakness in energy, tech and financials off-set the strength in miners and the early broad optimism, while Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) is the outperformer on bargain hunting after the prior day’s 3% drop and its worst performance YTD with Tokyo sentiment also boosted by currency weakness and reinvestment buying heading into ex-dividend day tomorrow. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) both began higher, although the momentum in the mainland later stalled after another PBoC liquidity drain and amid tentativeness ahead of upcoming blue-chip earnings including the Big-4 banks later this week with the industry anticipated to post slower profit growth for a 5th consecutive year.</p><p>In FX markets, price action has left much to be desired in which is the DXY is stuck around the 96.50 level as most major currencies trade rangebound overnight. EUR/USD is little changed at the weaker end of the 1.1300 handle near an option expiry for today’s New York cut and in the midst of several key DMA levels circa 1.1310-47. GBP/USD is also flat despite finding mild support after UK Parliament voted in favour to approve the government motion including the Letwin amendment A which seeks to take control of Parliament time to hold indicative votes on Brexit options, which was against government wishes and saw 3 junior minsters resign to support the effort to take control of the Brexit process in Parliament. Elsewhere, antipodeans marginally extended on Monday’s gains with NZD/USD also propped up by a surprise Trade Surplus and better than expected Exports data, while USD/JPY initially benefitted amid the risk appetite but was capped by technical levels around 110.00 and as strength in some of the Asia-Pac bourses began to wane.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand subdued amid the heightened risk appetite in Tokyo and with a 40yr auction scheduled later.</p>",
