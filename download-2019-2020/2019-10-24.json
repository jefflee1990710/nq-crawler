Pence also said President Trump remains optimistic that structural reforms in China can be reached and that the US will continue to seek better relations with China, while Pence added if US and China can get an economic relationship right, they can make progress on other issues. Furthermore, Pence commented that Hong Kong is an example of what can happen when China embraces liberty and said Beijing has increased interventions in HK, curtailing rights and liberties guaranteed in its international agreement.

Furthermore, the government was said to have threatened to go on strike if opposition Labour refuse a December 12th election on Monday and it also officially pulled the November 6th budget.

Tesla (TSLA) surged to highs of 20% in after-market trade following earnings which showed a surprise profit beat on EPS, and noting its Shanghai Gigafactory is working ahead of schedule, as is its Model Y, where it expects production expected by summer next year. Xilinx (XLNX) ultimately moved lower after guiding Q4 revenue well below estimates, although caveat by suggesting Q4 would be a trough. Lam Research (LRCX) beat on top and bottom line, forecasts the bottom range of its Q2 EPS and revenue guidance above street expectation. The strong figures and guidance led a boost to the semiconductor space which saw the SOX outperform its sub-index peers on Thursday. Both figures from LRCX &amp; TSLA led gains to the Nasdaq 100, which outperformed its US peers. Align Technology (ALGN) traded higher following a beat on both EPS &amp; revenue. Twitter (TWTR) plummeted over 20% on Thursday at one point on EPS and revenue misses, citing technical bugs hitting its top line. Baxter (BAX) traded lower as it announced an internal investigation due to financial misstatements. eBay (EBAY) lower despite EPS beat, due to softer guidance. PayPal (PYPL) surged despite softer guidance but a strong revenue print. Ford (F) tumbled as it cut its guidance, although the quarter was okay. S&amp;P 500 0.2% at 3010, NASDAQ-100 1% at 7967, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26806.</p><p>The T-Note again traded sideways in the lacklustre session, at least from a risk appetite perspective. The much feared/anticipated VP Pence speech on China took a rather balanced stance and provided no further indication for participants on how the trade war will pan out. The ECB was also a non-event given the last meeting’s fireworks. Earnings were mixed too, seeing equity bourses edge slightly higher, again little to sway participants either in or out of the debt complex. The US 7-year auction was fairly solid, stopping through by 0.7bps, covering above the 6-auction average, with a strong takedown, too – although the TPLEX didn’t blink. US T-note (Z9) settled half a tick lower at 129.27.</p>",

Earnings: Verizon Communications, Phillips 66, Charter Communications, Royal Caribbean, Aon, Ab InBev, Phillips, Unilever, Barclays.</li></ul><p><strong>* US VP PENCE'S CHINA SPEECH:</strong> US VP Pence said Trump is determined to build China relationship based on candour, fairness and mutual respect; US will no longer hope that economic engagement alone will transform China's into a free and open society, respecting rule of law. Says US is not seeking confrontation with China, nor to limit China's development, it is seeking a level playing field. Trump administration not seeking to decouple US economically from China, Pence said. The VP on Hong Kong, said it is an example of what can happen when China embraces liberty, though Beijing has increased interventions in HK, curtailing rights and liberties guaranteed in its international agreement. On US corporates, Pence argued that Nike (NKE) has checked social conscience at the door regarding HK; says in siding with China, NBA has silenced free speech and is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of an authoritarian regime. Pence concluded that China should never underestimate US resolve, and that US and China can and must work to share a peaceful and prosperous future, adding US will not allow challenges in US/China talks to foreclose practical cooperation. Despite some heavy words, China Global Times Editor (noted mouthpiece for the Chinese regime) said that Pence’s speech was mainly positive in regard to improving Sino-US relations.</p><p><strong>* CHINA AGS PURCHASES: </strong>Reports had suggested that China offered to purchase at least USD 20bln in US agricultural products within a year, as part of the Phase 1 trade deal; analysts noted that the USD 20bln of purchases would restore imports of US farm goods to levels before Trump slapped tariffs on the nation. Stratfor's geopolitical analysts said the latest offer might increases the chances of both signs signing a partial trade deal at the APEC summit in November.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>As expected, given the close proximity of the September meeting (where a raft of measures was unveiled) and it being Draghi’s last appearance as head of the Bank in Frankfurt, this week’s policy announcement delivered little in the way of fireworks. All three key rates were left unchanged as expected with the Governing Council maintaining their guidance on rates, reinvestments, bond purchases and tiering. In terms of the press conference, asides from facing numerous questions about his legacy at the Bank, a bulk of Draghi’s focus was once again placed on the need for fiscal assistance in order to help assist the ECB’s monetary efforts. This will likely garner further focus during the Lagarde era at the Bank with the former IMF Chief seen as a more than credible candidate in helping managing relations with the bloc’s various governments. Elsewhere, Draghi’s commentary on the current state of the Eurozone economy provided little in the way of fresh insight with the President noting “that incoming data confirms the GC view of protracted weakness and prominent downside risks, and muted inflationary pressures”, whilst also concluding that “risks remain on the downside”. From a policy perspective, Draghi was also questioned on whether or not the Bank could become hampered by the prospect of bond scarcity given the open-ended nature of the ECB’s APP, however, Draghi downplayed this line of enquiry by stating that it will take quite a bit of time before this becomes a problem. Overall, this week’s announcement and press conference provided little in the way of insight to the future course of action at the Bank with a bulk of the focus more one of reflection as Mario Draghi prepares to hand over the baton to Christine Lagarde.</p><p><strong>* MARKIT PMI (FLASH): </strong>US<strong> </strong>Services for October came in line with expectations at 51, inching up from the prior 50.9, whilst the Manufacturing component printed 51.5, beating the expected decline to 50.7 from the prior 51.1, altogether seeing the composite rise by 0.2 to 51.2. Markit noted “the fastest expansion of manufacturing production for six months”, although caveated that the forward-looking indicators remain subdued, “new work rose at the slowest pace since this index began in October 2009.” Over in Europe, Pantheon Macroeconomics note the “trivial” rise in the composite EZ figure to 50.2 from 50.1 (exp. 50.3). “The manufacturing PMI was unchanged at a poorly 45.7, while the services index edged slightly higher to 51.8 from 51.6 in September. The details aren’t pretty,” where the consultancy cites the weak new orders and production due to the manufacturing slump. The much-focused German figures remained dismal: Manufacturing printing 41.9 (exp. 42, prev. 41.7), whilst the Services component declined to 51.2, missing the expected 52.</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES:</strong> The headline was in line with expectations at 701k, falling a touch from a revised down 706k. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that this was the fourth consecutive month with sales running a little higher than has been implied by the lagged mortgage applications data. \"The bigger picture is clear enough,\" Pantheon writes, \"the trend in new home sales is rising, and the surge in mortgage purchase applications since the summer points to new cycle highs by the turn of the year, though a brief correction before then can’t be ruled out.\" The consultancy notes that the fall in mortgage rates is lifting demand, though it expects it to peak early next year, in the face of a sharp slowdown in payroll growth. \"For now, though, sales are firm, and inventory is quite low, so we’re expecting a hefty increase in fourth quarter construction, captured in the residential investment component of GDP (alas it accounts for only 3.7% of the economy).”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson will table a motion on Monday, under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, to have an election on 12 December, under the assumption that the EU will offer a Brexit delay until the 31st January (although reports alleged France is pushing for a much shorter delay until 15th November). 2/3s (or 434) of MPs will need to vote in favour of an election; the SNP and Liberal Democrats have previously called for an election, although some reports suggested they may not vote with the government. Labour, despite claims they would back an election once “no deal is off the table” (presumably meaning when an extension is granted into 2020), may be more reticent, their poor position in the polls spurring some calls for the party to try to delay an election into 2020. The party have provided mixed signals as whips announced they would be abstaining the vote on Monday in an email to Labour MP’s, however Labour Leader Corbyn announced a final decision would come tomorrow or over the weekend. It was also noted that the Tory party would essentially go on strike if the vote is rejected, by doing the bare minimum in Parliament. The EU may also wait to announce its decision on a Brexit extension, until Monday, whilst UK PM Johnson calls to get get parliament on board. If parliament does thwart the government’s attempt to press for an election, talks of a “government of national unity” could re-emerge; previously the idea has not stuck due to Labour’s insistence that it be led by Labour Leader Corbyn and the Lib Dems opposition to Corbyn as PM. It is worth noting a recent ComRes poll which put the Labour Party ahead when voters were asked their voting intentions \"the deadline for the UK to leave the EU has been extended beyond the 31st of October 2019\" (Labour at 27%, Conservative 26%, Brexit Party 20%, Lib Dems: 18%). An election on 12th December would give Parliament time to pass the government’s WAB (Parliament would be dissolved on 6th November), however a number of journalists pointed out that the opposition would be reluctant to hand the government such a victory in the run up to an election.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.2% at 3010, NASDAQ-100 1% at 7967, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26806,</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.1%, Consumer Staples 0.3%, Energy -0.4%, Financials 0%, Health Care -0.6%, Industrials 0.1%, Information Technology 1.5%, Materials 0.4%, Telecommunication Services -0.7%, Utilities 0.4%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Microsoft<strong> </strong>(MSFT) reported strong earnings, with a slightly slower than expected growth rate in Azure as the only nagging point, seeing it bolster indices on the day. Tesla (TSLA) surged to highs of 20% in after-market trade following earnings which showed a surprise profit beat on EPS, and noting its Shanghai Gigafactory is working ahead of schedule, as is its Model Y, where it expects production expected by summer next year. Xilinx (XLNX) ultimately moved lower after guiding Q4 revenue well below estimates, although caveat by suggesting Q4 would be a trough. Lam Research (LRCX) beat on top and bottom line, forecasts the bottom range of its Q2 EPS and revenue guidance above street expectation. The strong figures and guidance led a boost to the semiconductor space which saw the SOX outperform its sub-index peers on Thursday. Both figures from LRCX &amp; TSLA led gains to the Nasdaq 100, which outperformed its US peers. Align Technology (ALGN) traded higher following a beat on both EPS &amp; revenue. Twitter (TWTR) plummeted over 20% on Thursday at one point on EPS and revenue misses, citing technical bugs hitting its top line. Baxter (BAX) traded lower as it announced an internal investigation due to financial misstatements. eBay (EBAY) lower despite EPS beat, due to softer guidance. PayPal (PYPL) surged despite softer guidance but a strong revenue print. Ford (F) tumbled as it cut its guidance, although the quarter was okay.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.26 HIGHER AT USD 56.23/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.50 HIGHER AT USD 61.67/BBL: </strong>Oil prices<strong> </strong>moved higher on Thursday despite a lack of fresh demand, or supply, factor impetus and against dollar strength, where benchmarks gradually made gains throughout the session. The energy market seems to be extending its gains from Wednesday where the surprise draw in crude stocks reported by the EIA saw benchmarks gain around a buck and a half.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED HALF A TICK LOWER AT 129.27. </strong>The T-Note again traded sideways in the lacklustre session, at least from a risk appetite perspective. The much feared/anticipated VP Pence speech on China took a rather balanced stance and provided no further indication for participants on how the trade war will pan out. The ECB was also a non-event given the last meeting’s fireworks. Earnings were mixed too, seeing equity bourses edge slightly higher, again little to sway participants either in or out of the debt complex. The US 7-year auction was fairly solid, stopping through by 0.7bps, covering above the 6-auction average, with a strong takedown, too – although the TPLEX didn’t blink.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> traded firmer today with DXY breaking above 97.50 in the morning, the rally continued into the afternoon to see highs of 97.785 from overnight lows of 97.28. The US PMI data was relatively strong with the preliminary readings beating on Manufacturing and falling in line on services. China is also reportedly purchasing USD 20bln worth of agricultural goods, which is lower than the USD 40-50bln Trump said China would purchase as part of phase one of the deal, although no specific time frame was given. It was also noted that the USD 20bln in purchases is essentially what China was buying before the trade war. US VP Pence also followed up later with some rather punchy comments on Hong Kong and China, which may not go down to well with the Chinese. <strong>GBP </strong>was lower today retracing yesterday’s range trading from highs of 1.2949 to lows of 1.2785 driven by dollar strength, however some losses were pared back and the cross trades around the 1.2850 mark heading into ASIA-PAC. UK PM Johnson announced there will be a vote on Monday for a general election, although it is unlikely to pass as it appears Labour will reject the vote and abstain, although Corbyn did announce their final decision would come tomorrow or on the weekend. <strong>EUR </strong>saw choppy trade as it rose on better than expected French PMI data, however poor German PMI data reversed those gains. Draghi’s final policy meeting saw no fireworks as expected given the stimulus package introduced at its previous meeting, although EURUSD did rebound to post French PMI highs after he reiterated the importance of fiscal policy. <strong>Haven’s</strong> were firmer today, albeit, not so much against the buck given the strength in the greenback. XAU trades back above 1500, and JPY firmer against crosses, flat against the buck, CHF was weaker against the dollar, but firmer against other crosses. <strong>EMFX </strong>was weaker, with underperformance seen in TRY as it retraces some of its prior day gains. MXN, BRL &amp; ZAR all ~0.2% weaker against the greenback.</p><p><strong>* NORGES: </strong>Norges Bank maintained rates at 1.50% and reiterated the guidance from September, noting that the outlook for the period ahead is little changed. Noting that the upturn in the Norwegian economy is continuing ‘broadly in line with expectations, underlying inflation has been as projected’. As this meeting did not include updated forecasts or a press conference there is very little else to discuss from this meeting. Looking ahead Governor Olsen is scheduled to speak tomorrow at 08:00BST.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK: </strong>Riksbank, as expected, left rates unchanged at -0.25%. However, against some expectations, the Bank maintained their hiking bias noting a 25bp hike in December to 0.0% is likely; following this, the repo rate has been altered to indicate rates will remain unchanged at this period – essentially signalling a ‘one and done’ move. On the release the SEK significantly strengthened vs. EUR with EUR/SEK printing a low of 10.6519 as the retention of the hiking bias was picked up. As such, a number of banks have altered their base case to show a hike in December of 25bp after-which rates will remain on hold for the period ahead. Regarding the repo rate forecast, this has actually been lowered for Q419 to -0.25% (due to a December hike, if it occurs, not coming into effect until January 8th); further out, the repo path has rates remaining unchanged at the 0.0% mark until Q4 2021, with a full 25bp hike not visible anywhere on the path. Looking ahead, focus turns to comments from Ohlsson and Floden tomorrow.</p><p><strong>* CBRT: </strong>The CBRT cut its one-week repo rate by 250bps to 14%, well below the expected 15.5% and a greater cut than the lowest surveyed estimate of 14.5%. The Bank said the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is consistent with the projected disinflation path, which it noted that recent forecast revisions suggest inflation is likely to materialize notably below the projections of the July inflation report by year-end. It attributed the domestic demand conditions and the level of monetary tightness as continuing to support the disinflation picture, adding that in order to keep disinflation in track with the targeted path, the continuation of a cautious monetary policy stance is required. However, ING believes that inflation will reverse higher after October due to base effects, as of such, the case for further easing in December has significantly weakened, where future easing should be carried at a more gradual pace following the recent over-delivery, the bank says.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY</strong>: The US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu); Analysts at UBS note that there are around USD 84bln of cash flows at the end-month settlement (excluding SOMA holdings), including around USD 75bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons</p><p><strong>7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The September auction was decent, stopping through the screens by 0.5bps (largest stop through since March). Analysts at SocGen say the 7-year note trades fair in asset swap compared to older 7s, though trades rich on the curve versus 5s and 10s. The bank also notes that the current when issued yield is trading above last month's stop out rate, which may provide some support for the auction. Additionally, it is worth keeping in mind that, earlier on Thursday, the ECB policy meeting may influence action heading into the auction, while desks will also be wary of ongoing Brexit headline risk.</p><p><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>High Yield:</strong> (Prev. 1.633%, six-auction average 1.925%)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Tail:</strong> (Prev. -0.5bps, six-auction average 0.9bps)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Bid-to-Cover:</strong> (Prev. 2.49x, six-auction average 2.36x)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Dealers:</strong> (Prev. 20.2%, six-auction average 25.0%)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Directs:</strong> (Prev. 14.6%, six-auction average 16.8%)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Indirects:</strong> (Prev. 65.2%, six-auction average 58.1%)</p>",

Hence, the <strong>DXY</strong>’s firmer rebound to 97.700+ levels from just shy of 97.300 seemed to be more a function of broader risk aversion or defensive positioning amidst ongoing geopolitical, global trade and growth concerns, while Brexit uncertainty rumbles on as well.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>The G10 underperformers as the Aussie and Kiwi handed back more of their recent gains vs the Greenback towards 0.6800 and 0.6375 respectively having topped out ahead of 0.6900 and 0.64500. No specific or new catalyst behind the retracement, but Cable’s latest pull-back of around 100 pips to retest 1.2840 support was accompanied by another stream of headlines related to the prospect of a GE and how long the EU might offer the UK in terms of a further Article 50 extension. On that note, a meeting in Brussels has been set for 10CET/9BST tomorrow and PM Johnson is currently in consultation with his political cabinet.</p><p><strong>EUR/SEK/NOK/TRY/IDR</strong></p><p>All eyeing October Central Bank policy gatherings, but with varying degrees of anticipation. The Euro was not looking for much from the ECB given the scale of stimulus rolled out or preannounced in September, and as rates were duly held with an almost identical accompanying statement attention quickly turned to President Draghi for his final post-meeting press conference/Q&amp;A. His prepared text was also largely a carbon copy of the previous version, while questions were somewhat retrospective and focused on his 8 years in office, but Eur/Usd did rebound towards post-French PMI peaks after he reiterated the importance of fiscal policy before retreating and testing 1.1100 bids/support. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona strengthened after the Riksbank stuck to its hawkish line and pencilled in December for a 25 bp repo hike to zero rather than a window somewhere around the turn of this year, but pared gains within a 10.7400-6520 band vs the single currency as the rate path was trimmed and the Bank caveated with potential to ease if the domestic economy deteriorates more than anticipated. The Norwegian Crown tagged along and hardly deviated when the Norges Bank essentially maintained its assessment and guidance from September, but the Turkish Lira was undermined by a bigger than expected CBRT cut (-250 bp vs -200 bp bottom end of consensus range) and retained an easing bias due to a weaker than previously envisaged inflation outlook. Finally, the BI took its cumulative easing to 100 bp with a 4th ¼ point cut, but in line with forecast and only marginally weighing on the Rupiah.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Solid appreciation for the Real and a look at the psychological 4.0000 mark vs the Buck in wake of Senate approval for Brazil’s pension reform bill, albeit with some amendments.</p>",

Eur/Sek is holding near the base of a circa 10.7400-10.6510 range and still net down from pre-Riksbank levels around 10.7000, while Eur/Nok is hovering just under 10.1500 within 10.1680-10.1260 parameters in wake of the Norges Bank’s policy meeting that maintained an on hold stance after September’s ¼ point rise in the depo rate given the assessment that little has changed in the ensuing period. Elsewhere, the Indonesian Rupiah is modestly softer after the BI extended its run of consecutive eases to 4 and retained a dovish bias.</p><p>AUD/NZD - The major fall guys on little apparent or obvious in terms of negative news and a bearish catalysts, but the Aussie and Kiwi especially seem to have fallen prey to long liquidation and a turnaround in the technical landscape after failing to extend gains through/beyond big figure and psychological levels. Aud/Usd has lost momentum through 0.6850 and Nzd/Usd on a breach of 0.6400, while the Aud/Nzd cross has corrected a bit higher above 1.0650.</p><p>EUR/GBP - Nowhere near the biggest G10 movers on the day, but certainly rivalling others on price action given spikes in the single currency and Sterling to 1.1163 and 1.2950 vs the Dollar respectively at one stage followed by sharp/abrupt retreats to 1.1125 and 1.2880. For Eur/Usd, French PMIs were above forecast, but ultimately no more than a flash in the pan as preliminary surveys from Germany disappointed yet again and weighed on the pan Eurozone prints. Meanwhile, Cable’s rise and fall from grace came against the backdrop of latest Brexit and UK election headlines, but probably more on positioning and jitters awaiting the EU’s verdict on another A 50 extension and PM Johnson’s reaction. Back to the Euro, ECB President Draghi’s farewell meeting and press conference loom, but expectations are low in terms of anything pertinent on new policy or guidance.</p><p>JPY/CHF/CAD/DXY - All relatively subdued and lacking inspiration as the Yen meanders between 108.60-75 vs the Greenback, Franc pivots 0.9900, Loonie hovers just above 1.3100 and US Dollar index rebounds off a 97.278 low to 97.532 ahead of US data.</p><p>EM - The Lira is still eyeing Turkish-Syria developments and international interventions after recent gains on less angst from the US in wake of the ceasefire and President Trump promising to lift sanctions if peace prevails. However, the upcoming CBRT rate call will be watched for near term direction as forecast range from no change to a 200 bp cut – see our headline feed and Research Suite for more. Usd/Try currently straddling 5.7500.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>ECB, CBRT, US data and the 7 year Treasury auction still to come, but bonds have already marked out decent ranges and clocked up some hefty price moves. Indeed, Bunds were wrong-footed by French PMI beats and are now back below par, albeit off worst levels within a 171.16-77 range, while Gilts have been pulled pillar to post in sympathy, but also eyeing breaking Brexit headlines and Sterling fortunes between 131.80-132.37. However, US Treasuries are showing relative resilient or a reticence to being whip-sawed awaiting independent drivers in the form of data and the 7 year raffle.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The crude complex is slightly softer, amidst a slight pull-back from yesterday’s post-EIA Inventory data induced highs, with some choppiness seen in wake of mostly weaker than expected Eurozone PMI data. To the downside, technicians will be eyeing support at USD 54.90/bbl and USD 60.70/bbl for WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Dec’ 19 futures respectively (11th October highs for both); to the upside yesterday’s highs for each contract are at USD 61.30/bbl and USD 56.10/bbl respectively. In terms of crude specific fundamentals, the news flow has been light. Moving to metals; Gold is slight lower, despite soft Eurozone data. Copper, meanwhile, is holding on to decent gains made yesterday; Chilean miner Codelco said that some of its shipments may be delayed as a result of the ongoing protests and strikes in the country, that have seen operations affected in at least two mines and a smelter. Despite being pressured in recent weeks, as global economic data has continued to show deterioration (particularly in China, the largest buyer of the red metal), the unrest in Chile continues to provide support to prices, notes ING.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were steady with a subdued greenback keeping prices afloat, while <strong>copper</strong> was off yesterday’s best levels but with downside limited amid the mixed risk tone and early strength in Chinese commodity prices.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US President Trump said Turkey told the US that they will make the ceasefire permanent and the US will remove all sanctions on Turkey, unless something happens that the US is not happy with</strong>.

Indirect’s took a large portion of 65.7%, above the average 58%. Directs took 11.5% lower than the average take of 16.7%, which left dealers taking a rather small 22.8% in comparison to the 25.3% 6-auction average. At settlement yields were fractionally lower.

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were mixed after the PBoC continued with its liquidity efforts albeit at a reduced amount and with China dismissing reports of replacing Hong Kong Chief Executive Lam as political rumours, while the KOSPI (-0.2%) underperformed its regional peers following a miss on Q3 GDP. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as they took their cue from the lacklustre trade in T-notes, with demand restricted by the upbeat risk sentiment Japanese stocks and following mixed results at the 20yr JGB auction.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) are positive with energy stocks leading the advances in Australia following similar outperformance of the sector stateside on the back of a bullish EIA inventory report and with participants also engrossed in corporate updates, while sentiment in Tokyo is propped up by recent currency weakness and with double-digit percentage gains seen in Japan Display after Apple further extended an olive branch for the troubled screen manufacturer through shorter payment terms. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are afloat after the PBoC continued with its liquidity efforts albeit at a reduced amount and with China dismissing reports of replacing Hong Kong Chief Executive Lam as political rumours, although the KOSPI (-0.2%) underperforms its regional peers following a miss on Q3 GDP.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued and has slipped to a sub-97.50 level amid mild strength in its major counterparts with EUR/USD prodding higher ahead of today’s ECB where President Draghi is unlikely to provide any fireworks in his last hurrah at the helm of the central bank. GBP/USD is also slightly firmer and reclaimed the 1.2900 handle as prospects of a no-deal Brexit continue to shrink with EU diplomats to discuss the extension on Friday and a delay until January 31st seen as the most likely outcome. Elsewhere, USD/JPY mildly retraced some of yesterday’s gains but with the pullback limited by the positive risk tone, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD consolidate as the recent upside in commodities and gains in stocks provide a floor for the high-beta currencies.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as they take their cue from the lacklustre trade in T-notes, with demand restricted by the upbeat risk sentiment and ahead of the 20yr JGB auction later.</p>",
