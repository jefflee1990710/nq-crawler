NVDA was up over 8%, also boosted by positive trade headlines. General Electric (GE) rebounded from the prior day’s losses following the accountancy fraud report from Harry Markopolos; GE CEO bought more shares after the release of the report, and labelled it as pure ‘market manipulation’. Applied Materials (AMAT) were pressured despite earnings falling in line with expectations, as it stated the recovery in chip market is unlikely before 2020.

Housing data was mixed, but investors focused on the building permits beat rather than the housing starts miss, and yields saw upticks in wake of the data. There was, however, stabilization after a grim University of Michigan sentiment report. The Treasury curve took influence from Bunds in afternoon trade, after reports that the Germans were considering jettisoning its balanced budget objective if Germany falls into recession; the growth supportive approach helped Bund yields to rise, with Treasuries moving in sympathy, though the moves were pared back as trade lightened as traders headed for the exits for the week. Next week, the yield curve may refocus on more Fedspeak, with FOMC minutes and Jackson Hole on the slate. US T-note futures settled 1 tick lower at 130-29+.</p>",
