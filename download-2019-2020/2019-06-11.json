Facebook (FB) was supported by an upgrade from Moffett Nathanson. US-listed Chinese stocks, including Baidu (BIDU), JD.com (JD), Weibo Corp (WB) and huya (HUYA) all rallied following signals overnight that Beijing will support Chinese growth. Tesla (TSLA) moved higher in spite of news of another autopilot malfunction, reported by a woman in San Francisco.

Beyond Meat (BYND) sunk after JPM downgraded the co., saying that above-the-Street expectations now appeared to be priced in. Lyft (LYF) jumped higher after receiving an upgrade from Susquehanna. Uber (UBER) and GrubHub (GRUB) shares were buoyed by news that Amazon’s (AMZN) competitor restaurant delivery service was exiting the market.

The 3-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps on cover above recent averages. Crucially, the indirect bid (a proxy for foreign participation) actually rose to 56.6% from 37.9% (average 44.7% over the previous six), which was a relief to the analysts that had expected a weak showing after recent data showed foreign central banks reduced their UST holdings in the latest week by the most since April 2018. Some have speculated that the recent foreign cbank selling might be linked to China selling Treasuries to stem the slide in the yuan since May. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower, with 2s30s coming in by around 3bps, 2s5s flatter by around 2bps. Tomorrow, the US sells 10-year notes; last month’s auction was weak, seeing a 1.2bps tail. Investment funds cut their takedown (to 45% from 62% at the previous 10-year auction. Recent averages suggest the auction will stop on the screw, with a 75% buy-side takedown (13% direct, 62% indirect). TD Securities notes that the 10-year trades special in repo, which could signal strong demand at the auction. T-note futures (M9) settled unchanged at 126-14.</p>",

US President Trump was vocal in his criticisms/opinions for a second day: accusing China of the devaluing their currency and subsidizing companies to lessen effect of 25% tariff.&nbsp; He also said China wants to make a trade deal \"very badly\" and will not do a deal with China unless it is a great deal whilst going as far saying that he is the one holding up the trade deal (possibly implying that he is holding out for a “great deal”). On a slightly softer note Trump did also say that he expects to meet Chinese President Xi at the G20. Comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross added to the feeling that the outcome of the G20 meeting, at which the market will be hoping for some form of “trade truce” between the US and China (similar to what happened last November), will likely be a binary one, where he said that either China tariffs will be increased or a deal will be made (Trump has previously hinted that he will wait and see how the G20 goes before deciding on further China tariffs). Ross did also add that he expects a deal to be reached eventually and noted that he does not expect a deal to be reached at the G20. Later, White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney suggested that the recent Mexico deal will embolden US President Trump to be tougher on China. US NEC Director Kudlow was upbeat on the prospect of a deal: saying once Trump and Xi meet at the G20 \"we can pick up where we left off\" with regards to the trade deal. China’s Global Times Editor, however, was less optimistic on the prospect on a deal being reached on at the G20, whilst also saying that there is no sign that China is relaxing countermeasures against the US and that China does not trust the mild signals the US sometimes sends.</p><p><strong>* MEXICO:</strong> President Trump on Tuesday teased the market, saying that “The biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed!” What exactly this might be remains unclear, especially given the fact that US President Trump’s weekend claims that Mexico were to commence large purchases of US agricultural goods were duly denied by Mexico’s Foreign Minister Ebrard yesterday. Elsewhere, Mexican Foreign Minister said that Mexico will be paying for the migration measures with its own funds. Later, Newswires reported that the US/Mexico deal document held by US President Trump outside the White House outlined a regional asylum plan with Mexico and also says Mexico will look into domestic laws and regulations with a view to make possible changes.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB's Rehn suggested that the bank could bolster forward guidance, lower rates, and introduce measures to mitigate the impact of negative rates and resume QE, if necessary. He also reasserted that central bank is determined to act in the event of further weakening of economic activity. Further, regarding Eurozone inflation expectations, which recently receded to record lows, Rehn conceded that the ECB's price stability goal will be hampered in the event of low inflation expectations. ECB’s Kazimir noted his confidence that the ECB has the tools necessary to achieve its target and that the bank’s latest decisions prove its willingness to act. Kazimir also noted that he didn’t see a recession or deflation in the near future but the Eurozone remains far from their inflation target and that the ECB is not at a point where more policy tools need to be used. In line with the sources report from the weekend, Kazmir said FX is a factor the ECB considers in policy deliberations. (NOTE: on the weekend, a Reuters sources piece suggested that the ECB would be open to rate cuts if the EZ economy slows, while also suggesting that Euro strength would form part of the reason to cut rates.)</p><p><strong>* US PPI:</strong> Producer prices rose by 0.1% M/M in May, in line with the consensus view; core rose 0.2% M/M a touch ahead of expectations. The Y/Y headline fell by more than expected, to 1.8% vs 2.0% exp and previous 2.2%, largely due to energy, food, and other non-core categories weighing on the headline. The data fuelled further analysts to raise the possibility of Fed rate cuts; Oxford Economics said “with risks rising again on the trade front and core consumer prices persistently below the Fed’s target, we now look for the Fed to implement a 25bp rate cut in December.”</p><p><strong>* US NFIB:</strong> Optimism among smaller US firms rose by 1.5 points to 105.0 in May, the highest since October. Capex plans rose, inflationary pressures fell. Labour market components, much of which were released last week, were strong. “Despite trade uncertainty, owners are confident about future prospects,” Wells Fargo said, “notably, 30% of firms plan to increase capital spending out lays, a historically high level and up three points during the month.” The inflation moderation suggests slowing demand might be curbing pricing power, WFC said.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> US President Trump said he believes something positive will happen between the US and North Korea, after saying he received a “beautiful” letter from Kim Jong Un. National Security Advisor John Bolton also said earlier that a third US-North Korea summit is a possibility, and the US is ready when NK is.</p><p><strong>* UK JOBS DATA:</strong> A strong jobs report where the rate of joblessness remained unchanged, and the decline of average weekly wages (inc bonus) was more benign than the consensus had estimated, while total hours increased. Vacancies, meanwhile, are lower versus earlier in the year, but remain high historically, analysts said. The big takeaway was wages ex bonuses rose to 3.8% Y/Y, the highest since May 2008, on the back of a large rise in public sector wages, though the tightness of the labour market is also a factor cited by analysts. “With the labour market unlikely to weaken suddenly soon and government policies set to remain supportive of faster wage growth, the MPC can’t afford to ignore the constant inflation pressure now emitted by the labour market,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> After yesterday’s hawkish comments from BoE's Saunders, where he (and BoE’s Haldane) suggested that the Bank might have to raise rates due to inflationary pressures, and despite the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, Saunders provided a more balanced view, and in more general terms described the banks reaction function to the downside; he said the BOE could lower rates to zero, but not below, and it could restart QE. He also added that, at lower rates, it may be appropriate to move rates more actively in either direction than at higher rates. Today’s strong employment report gave further credence to the argument for rate hikes, analysts said. BoE’s Broadbent and Vlieghe both also spoke today, both towing the neutral line in saying that they agree with the BoE’s May forecasts.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Following on from comments from Conservative front-runner Boris Johnson on Monday, in which he threatened to withhold from the EU the previously agreed GBP 39bln divorce bill and promised to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, German Europe Minister Roth took a tough line: saying that the EU will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, regardless of who the next PM is.</p><p><strong>* CBRT PREVIEW:</strong> <strong>CBRT Rate Decision (June 2019) will be published on Wednesday 12th June 2019, at 12:00BST/0700EDT: </strong>The CBRT rate decision will be published on Wednesday 12th June 2019, at 12:00BST/0700EDT. The central bank is expected to hold rates at 24.00%, despite improving inflation dynamics, more favourable FX movements; these will likely see the CBRT cautious on signalling any rate cuts, while any tightening bias is not foreseen following the removal in April. To download the report, please click here.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> USD trades flat, off highs with mixed PPI data doing little to rock the boat, with desks attributing marginal downside to cooling global trade optimism. EUR edged higher, largely a function of the buck, but also supported by decent Sentex data. GBP was one of the outperformers on the day; strong employment data added credence to hawkish comments from BoE members, who have been talking up the need for gradual rate hikes to counter inflationary pressures despite continued Brexit related uncertainty. Cable has consolidated above 1.2700 in response. JPY is trading flat: despite dovish commentary from Kuroda. NOK saw choppy price action, popping lower after disappointing consumer price index data before reversing the move after a robust Norges Bank regional survey that keeps the Scandi CB on course for further policy normalisation next Thursday. AUD continues to consolidate around 69.50 ahead of this week’s jobs report, which will set the tone for the upcoming RBA meeting; NAB data overnight employment subcomponent was encouraging. TRY was an underperformer in the EM complex, as US/Turkey geopolitical tensions weighed. ZAR is outperforming EMFX, continuing the rebound despite concerns over the Eskom bailout. BRL continues to gain in the slipstream of Mexico averting tariffs, while hopes of pension reform are also underpinning. MXN continues to build on gains post avoiding US tariffs, but underperforms EMFX, with some desks suggesting this is perhaps due to challenges that remain with regards to enforcing the immigration agreement.

Facebook (FB) was supported by an upgrade from Moffett Nathanson. US-listed Chinese stocks, including Baidu (BIDU), JD.com (JD), Weibo Corp (WB) and huya (HUYA) all rallied following signals overnight that Beijing will support Chinese growth. Tesla (TSLA) moved higher in spite of news of another autopilot malfunction, reported by a woman in San Francisco. CVS Health (CVS) was under pressure as news emerged that a US District Judge is mulling blocking the drug makers merger with Aetna. Beyond Meat (BYND) sunk after JPM downgraded the co., saying that above-the-Street expectations now appeared to be priced in. Lyft (LYF) jumped higher after receiving an upgrade from Susquehanna. Uber (UBER) and GrubHub (GRUB) shares were buoyed by news that Amazon’s (AMZN) competitor restaurant delivery service was exiting the market. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) both sunk after news emerged that ten US state AGs are planning to file a lawsuit as early as today to prevent the merger. Raytheon (RTN) and United Technologies (UTX) both sunk as investors had a second day to digest its proposed merger. FedEx Corp (FDX) was under pressure after being removed from Barclays’ top picks list. Insys Therapeutics (INSY) shares sunk further after Nasdaq discarded the stock. Dollar Tree (DLTR) jumped higher on a JPM upgrade. LyondellBasell (LYB) moved higher after Jefferies raised its profit target for the firm on their proposed share buy-back programme. A number of banks, including Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and State Street (STT) made cautious comments regarding trading revenue for Q2; all saw negative ticks, especially State Street, whose shares plummeted.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.01 HIGHER AT USD 53.27/BBL; BRENT (Q9) FUTURES SETTLE UNCHANGED AT 62.29/BBL:</strong> Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday in what was a choppy session. As usual, there are several factors to be considered, PVM’s analysts note, “those of a bullish disposition take heart from mounting expectations that OPEC-led cuts will be extended throughout 2019.” Regarding the meeting, Iranian officials are yet to agree on the new proposed dates to move the OPEC meeting from June to early July; the Secretariat is looking at the option of holding OPEC meet in June and the non-OPEC in July. Essentially no consensus yet. WTI is likely catching some momentum ahead of the weekly US energy inventories (APIs after the bell on Tuesday) where current expectations see crude stocks drawing -0.5mln bbls, and the products building (+1.1mln bbls for distillates, +0.7mln bbls for gasoline). A similar print as last week would pose a real risk to the market, where the EIA report was bearish on all fronts and production stood at record highs. The large build in crude was accompanied with similar readings in the products, raising concerns about demand in what is meant to be the start of the historically strong summer runs out of refineries.</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO:</strong> The EIA cut its forecast for 2019 and 2020 oil demand growth by 160k BPD and 110k BPD, respectively, and now sees 1.22mln BPD and 1.42mln BPD YY increases. It sees US crude output rising 1.36mln BPD in 2019 to 12.32mln BPD (compared with the 1.49mln BPD increase in the prior month); sees US crude output rising 94k to 13.26mln BPD in 2020 (compared with the 93K BPD increase previously).</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE UNCHANGED AT 126-14:</strong> A roller-coaster session saw the T-Note future slip to 126-07 in European trade, after China stimulus measures stoked risk sentiment; however, the risk tone became more neutral (some desks cited \"fading trade optimism\", although a more distinct and convincing reason for the Treasury bid and the equity downside was more ellusive), the complex slowly grinded its way up towards flat levels by settlement. The 3-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps on cover above recent averages. Crucially, the indirect bid (a proxy for foreign participation) actually rose to 56.6% from 37.9% (average 44.7% over the previous six), which was a relief to the analysts that had expected a weak showing after recent data showed foreign central banks reduced their UST holdings in the latest week by the most since April 2018. Some have speculated that the recent foreign cbank selling might be linked to China selling Treasuries to stem the slide in the yuan since May. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower, with 2s30s coming in by around 3bps, 2s5s flatter by around 2bps. Tomorrow, the US sells 10-year notes; last month’s auction was weak, seeing a 1.2bps tail. Investment funds cut their takedown (to 45% from 62% at the previous 10-year auction. Recent averages suggest the auction will stop on the screw, with a 75% buy-side takedown (13% direct, 62% indirect). TD Securities notes that the 10-year trades special in repo, which could signal strong demand at the auction.</p>",

The 3-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps on cover above recent averages. Crucially, the indirect bid (a proxy for foreign participation) actually rose to 56.6% from 37.9% (average 44.7% over the previous six), which was a relief to the analysts that had expected a weak showing after recent data showed foreign central banks reduced their UST holdings in the latest week by the most since April 2018. Some have speculated that the recent foreign cbank selling might be linked to China selling Treasuries to stem the slide in the yuan since May. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower, with 2s30s coming in by around 3bps, 2s5s flatter by around 2bps.</p>",

        "subject": "FX WRAP: USD little moved as EMs advance",
        "content": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> trades flat, off highs with mixed PPI data doing little to rock the boat, with desks attributing marginal downside to cooling global trade optimism. <strong>EUR</strong> edged higher, largely a function of the buck, but also supported by decent Sentex data. <strong>GBP</strong> was one of the outperformers on the day; strong employment data added credence to hawkish comments from BoE members, who have been talking up the need for gradual rate hikes to counter inflationary pressures despite continued Brexit related uncertainty. Cable has consolidated above 1.2700 in response. <strong>JPY</strong> is trading flat: despite dovish commentary from Kuroda. <strong>NOK</strong> saw choppy price action, popping lower after disappointing consumer price index data before reversing the move after a robust Norges Bank regional survey that keeps the Scandi CB on course for further policy normalisation next Thursday. <strong>AUD</strong> continues to consolidate around 69.50 ahead of this week’s jobs report, which will set the tone for the upcoming RBA meeting; NAB data overnight employment subcomponent was encouraging. <strong>TRY</strong> was an underperformer in the EM complex, as US/Turkey geopolitical tensions weighed. <strong>ZAR</strong> is outperforming EM FX, continuing the rebound despite concerns over the Eskom bailout. <strong>BRL</strong> continues to gain in the slipstream of Mexico averting tariffs, while hopes of pension reform are also underpinning. <strong>MXN</strong> continues to build on gains post avoiding US tariffs, but underperforms EM FX, with some desks suggesting this is perhaps due to challenges that remain with regards to enforcing the immigration agreement.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Deutsche Bank notes the impressive rally in the EUR over the last 10 trading days, which has seen the EUR move from a 1.11-1.12 range to a 1.13 handle; but DB questions that with Trump casting his eye on Europe, and political tensions in Italy, and sees this as a preferred area to fade the move back to the 200dma, towards the March high. However, ahead of the FOMC meeting next week, the bank suggests consolidation may be a theme.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Position adjustment is being cited ahead of Thursday’s jobs report, which will be a key input into whether the RBA decides to cut rates at its next meeting. The employment component in the NAB survey improved overnight, as did confidence, though conditions remains weak. Desks are noting that the RBA pricing and AUD seem in sync for now, making it difficult to take high conviction views of the AUD. The USD part of the equation may be more influential with CPI and retail sales this week.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> BOJ governor Kuroda has warned that if the FOMC were to cut rates, the BOJ has room to lower its -10bps rate even lower, while it can also reduce the target for JGB yields and also boost its monetary base. USDJPY seems well supported around 108.00, and even the knee-jerk reaction after the “weak” payrolls report could not keep the pair sub 108. Much will depend on how US fixed income trades, and specifically, the pricing for July’s Fed meeting; some desks have suggested that if that rate cut pricing does not ease, the USD rally might run out of steam, bringing sub-108 back into focus.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> PBOC overnight said it would sell yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong in late June, a measure analysts have said helps the central bank to control offshore liquidity. It would be the fourth occasion in recent months when it has issued bills in HK. The timeframe is particularly interesting given the G20 meeting on 28-29 June, where US and Chinese policymakers are expected to discuss trade.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> The rand has rebounded from YTD lows seen last week, on concerns that the government will have to raise issuance in order to rescue Eskom. Some desks warn that local bond markets could see further outflows, particularly after Moody’s warned that the shock Q1 GDP contraction was credit negative. SocGen notes foreign investors have cut ZAR bond holdings from 42.8% in March last year, to 39.2% currently.</p><p><strong>* NOK:</strong> Inflation downside surprise was driven by air fares, with CPI-ATE 2.3% Y/Y, below the Norges Bank’s 2.5% Y/Y forecast. The Norges Bank is the only G10 central bank where markets are pricing in a rate hike in the near-term, and SEB believes that the downside surprise does not derail the hawkish case: “core inflation has been above the target for seven consecutive months and despite today’s downside surprise, it remains an argument for tighter monetary policy.” SEB still sees the Norges Bank lifting its key rate to 1.25% at the 20th June meeting. It does warn, however, that as a result of the inflation print, the NB may want to revise its rate hike trajectory modestly narrower. “The impact on the rate path may, however, will be minor; prices on air tickets are notoriously volatile, the import-weighted krone is weaker than assumed and the labour market remains strong. Norges Bank’s long-term trajectory puts CPI-ATE inflation at the 2% target until end 2022.”</p>",

As usual, there are several factors to be considered, PVM’s analysts note, “those of a bullish disposition take heart from mounting expectations that OPEC-led cuts will be extended throughout 2019.” Regarding the meeting, Iranian officials are yet to agree on the new proposed dates to move the OPEC meeting from June to early July; the Secretariat is looking at the option of holding OPEC meet in June and the non-OPEC in July. Essentially no consensus yet. WTI is likely catching some momentum ahead of the weekly US energy inventories (APIs after the bell on Tuesday) where current expectations see crude stocks drawing -0.5mln bbls, and the products building (+1.1mln bbls for distillates, +0.7mln bbls for gasoline). A similar print as last week would pose a real risk to the market, where the EIA report was bearish on all fronts and production stood at record highs. The large build in crude was accompanied with similar readings in the products, raising concerns about demand in what is meant to be the start of the historically strong summer runs out of refineries.</p>",

With USD 24bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the supply will raise a net USD 54bln of new cash. TD Securities points out that the Fed’s portfolio run-ff has slowed to USD 15bln in Treasuries, versus USD 30bln previous, however, with no SOMA maturities in the mid-month, the Fed is set to conduct its add-ons later in the month.</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Recent auctions have been mixed, with some desks suggesting that lower rates are a factor. With that said, recent speculation that the Fed could fire some “insurance” rate cuts might be supportive. Recent averages suggest we could see a tail at the 3-year auction of 0.3bps, with 61% buy-side takedown (16% to directs, and 45% to indirects).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/288c820d-a31f-4fb2-b783-d21063ea4f74.jpg\"></figure>",

Usd/G10 pairings are back within broad ranges, while EM currencies are mostly firmer vs the Greenback, bar the Lira, as the DXY holds between 96.893-673. Note, comments from US President Trump bemoaning Euro and other currency devaluation vs the Usd, alongside another tirade against the Fed for hiking too much and running down the balance sheet were largely shrugged off.</p><p><strong>GBP/NOK/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>The major outperformers or most resilient to Buck bounces, as the Pound drew encouragement from firmer than forecast UK wages and more hawkish BoE commentary following yesterday’s underperformance on bleak GDP, ip, manufacturing and construction output. Cable consolidated above 1.2700 in response and Eur/Gbp pared back from new multi-week peaks around 0.8930 to just under 0.8900. Similarly, Eur/Nok reversed from 9.8300+ levels and test of decent upside resistance to and through pre-Norwegian inflation data levels as softer than expected CPI prints were more than offset by a robust Norges Bank regional survey that keeps the Scandi CB on course for further policy normalisation next Thursday. Eur/Nok currently testing 9.7600 in contrast to Eur/Sek above 10.6800 in the run up to Swedish inflation at the end of the week. Turning to the single currency itself, and apart from the aforementioned Trump broadside, bearish impulses included a negative Sentix index and dovish ECB Rehn rhetoric, but Eur/Usd held just above 1.1300 where decent option expiry interest rolled off at the NY cut. Elsewhere, the Loonie meandered between 1.3250-77 and will maintain bullish momentum to augment post-strong Canadian labour market gains if it closes above the 200 DMA (1.3273).</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/CHF/NZD</strong></p><p>All on the backfoot vs the Greenback, to varying degrees, as the Aussie hovers around 0.6950 and derives some indirect support from cross winds undermining the Kiwi that is technically if not fundamentally weaker in the face of a potential NZ live cattle export ban. Indeed, Nzd/Usd slipped further from 0.6600 to 0.6570 as Aud/Nzd extended its rebound from near 1.0500 lows to 1.0580 and Nzd/Jpy saw further declines through stops through 71.50. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf both traded nearer the top of 108.80-36 and 0.99936-0.9893 respective parameters on the US-Mexican trade deal risk supportive vibe, and with the Yen also taking on board latest pledges by the Japanese Government to support the economy, while the Franc anticipates ongoing dovish guidance from the SNB on Thursday.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand has continued its recovery from recent lows under 15.0000 vs the Usd with the aid of solid SA manufacturing data, but the Lira has retreated further amidst more US vs Turkey-Russia missile angst and as the focus turns to Wednesday’s CBRT policy meeting with the tone key for further direction. Usd/Zar sub-14.6850 and Usd/Try hovering around 5.8300.</p>",

Sectors are broadly in the green with the exception of defensive sectors amid the current “risk on” mood, whilst material names are outperforming as Dalian iron ore futures spiked 6% higher on supply concerns and copper prices rose almost 1% on the firmer risk sentiment. In terms of in individual movers, Thyssenkrupp (+5.5%) sits near the top of the Stoxx 600 as the steel name benefits from the aforementioned iron ore spike.

Hence, the Pound has rebounded across the board with Cable back above 1.2700 and testing yesterday’s pre-data peaks ahead of resistance seen around 1.2740, while Eur/Gbp has reversed from fresh multi-week highs circa 0.8932 through 0.8900.</p><p>NZD/JPY/CHF/AUD - In contrast to Sterling’s revival, the Kiwi has extended losses to 0.6588 vs its US counterpart and 1.0550+ against the Aussie, which is also weak compared to the Buck but holding up better around 0.6950 ahead of jobs data on Thursday.

On the flip-side, Eur/Usd is still butting up against resistance ahead of 1.1350 and the 200 DMA (1.1365), including option barriers and more expiries, like 2.3 bn from 1.1340 to 1.1350 and 2.8 bn at 1.1360.</p><p>NOK - The Norwegian Crown slipped in wake of considerably sub-consensus CPI metrics that called into question firm Norges Bank guidance for a rate hike at this month’s policy meeting, but Eur/Nok reversed from a probe over resistance around 9.8300 to revisit pre-inflation data levels sub-9.7800 on the back of an upbeat regional survey that restored June tightening expectations.

The 10 year debt future just hit a fresh Liffe low at 129.90 (-44 ticks on the day) and 3 month contracts are as much as 6.5 ticks adrift, while USTs are succumbing to more pronounced bear-steepening into supply and PPI, with Bunds being dragged down in sympathy it seems.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (-0.3%) futures are choppy as the benchmarks are benefitting from the improved risk tone,with the former around USD 62.50/bbl and the latter hitting a session peak just under USD 54.00/bbl. </strong>News flow has been light for the complex as participants eye tonight’s EIA Short term Energy Outlook report and API inventories release with the street looking for a headline draw of 1.25mln barrels. Elsewhere, Energy Intel’s Senior Correspondent notes that Russian Energy Minister Novak requested a delay to the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting (originally scheduled for June 25/26) as a later date would give key participants the chance to discuss the issue more at the G-20 summit on June 28. The correspondent also notes of that Iranian officials are yet to agree on the new proposed dates to move the OPEC meeting from June to early July, according to sources and the current secretariat is looking at the option of holding OPEC meet in June and the non-OPEC in July. Elsewhere, gold (-0.4%) continues to fall at the whim of a firmer risk appetite, whilst in terms of base metals, copper (+0.9%) extends on its gains aided by the risk tone and Dalian iron ore surged 6% on supply woes amid expectations that&nbsp; miners will be unable to expand output to meet higher steel demand. Subsequently, JPM modestly upgraded its Chinese steel demand and iron ore price forecasts, noting that the peak disruption “is likely behind us”.</p><p><strong>Iranian officials are yet to agree on the new proposed dates to move the OPEC meeting from June to early July, according to sources via Energy Intelligence; adds secretariat is looking at the option of holding OPEC meet in June and the non-OPEC in July. </strong>(Twitter)</p>",

News flow has been light for the complex as participants eye tonight’s EIA Short term Energy Outlook report and API inventories release with the street looking for a headline draw of 1.25mln barrels. Elsewhere, Energy Intel’s Senior Correspondent notes that Russian Energy Minister Novak requested a delay to the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting (originally scheduled for June 25/26) as a later date would give key participants the chance to discuss the issue more at the G-20 summit on June 28. The correspondent also notes of that Iranian officials are yet to agree on the new proposed dates to move the OPEC meeting from June to early July, according to sources and the current secretariat is looking at the option of holding OPEC meet in June and the non-OPEC in July. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> (-0.4%) continues to fall at the whim of a firmer risk appetite, whilst in terms of base metals, <strong>copper</strong> (+0.9%) extends on its gains aided by the risk tone and Dalian iron ore surged 6% on supply woes amid expectations that&nbsp; miners will be unable to expand output to meet higher steel demand. Subsequently, JPM modestly upgraded its Chinese steel demand and iron ore price forecasts, noting that the peak disruption “is likely behind us”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In terms of the latest news from the UK leadership race, the right-wing 92 Group within the Conservatives held a non-binding vote to gauge support in which former Foreign Minister and hardcore Brexiteer Boris Johnson received the most votes, while former party leader Iain Duncan Smith also backed Boris Johnson to deliver the Brexit. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> remained underpinned by risk sentiment and antipodeans were lacklustre in which <strong>NZD/USD</strong> gave up the 0.6600 handle and <strong>AUD/USD</strong> also failed to sustain the early upside which had been triggered by a surge in iron ore prices and strength in <strong>CNY</strong> in the wake of a firmer than expected PBoC fix.&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mostly higher as the relief rally was sustained in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures pared some of the prior day’s losses after prices rebounded from support near the USD 53.00/bbl with focus now shifting to the latest inventory numbers beginning with the API report after-hours later. As a reminder, there were also recent comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak that suggested the scenario of oil prices falling to USD 30/bbl cannot be excluded should the output cut deal not be extended. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> traded sideways as USD consolidated and due to a lack of safe-haven demand, while <strong>copper</strong> prices benefitted from the risk appetite and as Chinese commodities gained including <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> futures which surged by around 3% shortly after the open on tightening supply concerns.</p><p>GEOPOLITCAL</p><p><strong>North Korea state media called on the US to “withdraw its hostile policy” towards Pyongyang or agreements made at the Singapore summit 1 year ago may become “a blank sheet of paper\".</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Chinese press reports stated the US Air Force is preparing to run through aggressor drills to simulate combat with China's J-20 fighter jets, while it was also <strong>reported that China and Russia are expected to form an alliance to fend off the US</strong>.

However, some attribute higher yields to positioning ahead of this week’s supply, with attention on whether foreign buyers are willing to scoop up Treasuries at the recently lower yields. Additionally, some will be mindful of the FOMC meeting next week, and for any nod to the recent dovish pricing of the FOMC rate trajectory (will the Fed shift from neutral to an easing bias?). There is also the CPI report on Wednesday, where a lower print might squash yields down towards the bottom of the recent ranges; conversely, CPI above expectations and a strong retail sales report (Friday) could provide a hurdle to the bullish thesis running in Treasuries. Monday also saw a large amount of corporate; IFR noted that high grade supply looked set to head towards USD 15bln or more on the day. At settlement, yields at the belly of the curve saw the most pronounced move, 10-year yield up just over 6bps, with the 2s/10s steepening c. 1.1bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled 14+ ticks lower at 126-14.</p><p><strong>President Trump stated that the US has an agreement on something with Mexico that they will announce very soon</strong> and that he does not think Mexico will be denying for very long the undisclosed portion of the agreement.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were higher across the board after a similar lead from US where sentiment was underpinned by the US-Mexico tariff relief which lifted the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA to a 5-day and 6-day win streak respectively, although gains in the region were initially capped amid a lack of fresh catalysts. ASX 200 (+1.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) traded positive with early outperformance in Australia as it played catch up on return from the extended weekend and with Vocus Group the largest gainer following a takeover offer from AGL Energy, while the Japanese benchmark was just about kept afloat by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.9%) conformed to the upbeat tone despite another net liquidity drain by the PBoC and mixed comments by US President Trump who stated that a trade deal with China will work out because of tariffs but warned the next USD 300bln of tariffs will come into effect if Chinese President Xi does not come to the G20. Nonetheless, mainland China outperformed after China issued notice encouraging investment in local government special bonds issuance for project financing and amid reports that the PBoC may continue to support banks through various tools. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as yields tracked the rebound in their US counterparts and with demand for Japanese bonds also sapped by gains in stocks and after weaker demand in the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board after a similar lead from US where sentiment was underpinned by the US-Mexico tariff relief which lifted the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA to a 5-day and 6-day win streak respectively, although gains in the region were initially capped amid a lack of fresh catalysts. ASX 200 (+1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are positive with Australia leading the upside as it plays catch up on return from the extended weekend and with Vocus Group the largest gainer following a takeover offer from AGL Energy, while the Japanese benchmark has just about been kept afloat by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) conform to the positive tone despite another net liquidity drain by the PBoC and mixed comments by US President Trump who stated that a trade deal with China will work out because of tariffs and warned the next USD 300bln of tariffs will come into effect if Chinese President Xi does not come to the G20.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback has consolidated following the prior day’s choppy price action and as its major counterparts trade mixed in which EUR/USD is held steady by support at 1.1300 and with GBP/USD lacking vigour after its recent slip below the 1.2700 handle. In terms of the latest news from the UK leadership race, the right-wing 92 Group within the Conservatives held a non-binding vote to gauge support in which former Foreign Minister and hardcore Brexiteer Boris Johnson received the most votes, while former party leader Iain Duncan Smith also backs Boris Johnson to deliver the Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY remains underpinned by risk sentiment and antipodeans are lacklustre with NZD/USD attempting a breakdown from the 0.6600 handle and after AUD/USD failed to sustain the early upside which had been triggered by a surge in iron ore prices and strength in CNY in the wake of a firmer than expected PBoC fix.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as yields track the rebound in their US counterparts and with demand for Japanese bonds also sapped by gains in stocks and ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction in the long-end.</p>",
