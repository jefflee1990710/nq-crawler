(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Further equity volatility to end the week due to the evolving COVID-19 situation. The further falling of yields continued to weigh on financials (BKX, XLF). Lower energy prices weighed on the sector (XLE, XOP) – meanwhile, Occidental (OXY) reported a disappointing quarter but decent production guidance and EOG Resources (EOG) missed on Revenue but boosted its dividend. Lower gold prices weighed on gold miners (NEM, LK, GOLD). Emerson (EMR) took a hit on warning of COVID-19 effecting its sales. Trade Desk (TTD) surged on strong earnings and guidance. Wayfair (W) tumbled lower on a larger than expected loss. Foot Locker (FL) made strong gains after a decent quarter. Gilead (GILD) pared some of its recent strength amid a downgrade at DZ Bank and announcing a takeover offer for Forty Seven (FTSV), which surged. Dell (DELL) posted decent top and bottom line figures although was offered amid weakness in its datacentre unit. Mylan (MYL) sold off after disappointing earnings and COVID-19 business impact warnings. Autodesk (ADSK) traded firmer after a strong quarter, although guidance was more or less inline. Live Nation (LYV) was another gainer after a decent quarter. PG&amp;E (PCG) traded lower after California regulators increased its wildfire fine. SPX -0.82% at 2954, NDQ +0.30% at 8462, DJIA -1.4% at 25,409.</p><p>Another big rip higher in the TPLEX, the largest such this week, led by the short end as virus concerns move the market’s expectations towards Fed accommodation, in addition to haven and month-end flows. The move higher came across the whole session, and found some additional pressure in the tail-end on the back of Powell’s remarks that the virus is an “evolving risk”, which some are alluding to as a shoe-in to a potential “material change to the outlook”. The rates market certainly believes the Fed won’t hold back, with 95bps of rate cuts now priced in for 2020, with 50bps expected for the March FOMC meeting – accompanied by excessive volume in rates futures. Additionally, desks draw attention to month-end rebalancing likely exacerbating the bid into duration from index buyers. While in the background, the virus continues to spread, impacting global supply chains and continuing investor appetite for Treasuries. At the US equity cash close the entire curve had bull steepened significantly, the 2-year yield was down 19bps and the 30-year a relatively “meagre” 10bps, with the 10-year yield down 13.5bps to 1.165%, off its all-time-low of 1.116%. US T-Note futures (H0) settled 1 point &amp; 13 ticks higher at 134-27.</p>",
