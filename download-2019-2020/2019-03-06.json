Today's price action seemed sentiment driven rather than event driven, with more timely reminders about the slowing global growth narrative (OECD cut outlook on Weds, BOC talked about uncertainties, Aussie GDP was soft overnight, the Beige Book mentions of \"slow\").

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities down, dollar up, treasuries up, crude mixed.</strong></p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: Dovish BOC; US trade deficit at decade wide; Trump says China talks going well; ECB to cut growth to accommodate TLTROs</strong></p><p><strong>* AHEAD: Australian Trade Balance, EZ GDP (Revised), Japanese Household Spending &amp; GDP (Revised), ECB Rate Decision &amp; Press Conference, BoE's Tenreyro Speaking, Fed's Brainard Speaking, ECB's Praet Speaking, Supply from France &amp; Spain, Earnings from: Costco, Continental, Merck, Aviva, LafargeHolcim</strong></p><p><strong>* GLOBAL GROWTH: </strong>Today's reminder of slowing global growth conditions was provided by the OECD, which cut its estimates for world growth by 0.2ppts to 3.3% - still healthy, but in keeping with the tone of downward revisions. The 'activity currencies' give us another indication of slowing momentum, after last week's soft GDP data out of Canada, and the overnight soft GDP data out of Australia. And today, the BOC talked about uncertainty around the growth front in its policy statement. It would be easy to cite China's cutting of its growth target as the 2019 NPC began, though this was largely expected, and policymakers have been transitioning towards more 'normal' growth rates for some time - the key driver remains trade talks with the US, out of which we are still waiting for clarity that can dispel concerns of downside driven by trade tensions. It is worth watching developments in South Korea, which could be a better bellwether of Asian economic performance given the export-nature of its economy; the weaker tone of trade data out of SK, combined with declining inflation, perhaps illustrates the point more clearly. The Bank of Korea has erred hawkish recently, on the back of financial stability concerns, and April's meeting is worth keeping on the radar to see if the hawkishness is dialled down, or indeed, the central bank pivots dovish, like so many other central banks have. In the meantime, out of the US, the official labour market report on Friday will give us a clue about how widespread the gloomy feeling might become; a poor report will no doubt keep growth concerns in the forefront of traders' minds, while a good showing will (like Tuesday's non-manufacturing ISM headline) likely lead some to question whether the pricing out of Fed rate hikes since January are justified. Even if there was an upside beat, however, SocGen's strategists question whether the US can \"sail on serenely while Asian and European economies are increasingly grounded in mud.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Williams (voter, neutral) </strong>said if strong US economy continues, but inflation trends lower, Fed may need to lower rates. He<strong> </strong>reiterated the Fed’s stance of flexibility and data dependence, sees the current Fed Funds Rate of 2.4% as neutral. On the balance sheet, he said he has no answer on when the runoff will end, said the Fed is actively discussing the matter with a decision to come in the upcoming months. Williams said major risks to the US economy were global and that global growth concerns have materialised. The Fed’s <strong>Beige Book</strong> signalled slow growth, with around half districts said the government shutdown slowed some sectors like retail, autos and manufacturing; wages continued to rise with the majority of districts reporting moderately higher pay, prices also continued to rise at a modest-to-moderate clip.</p><p><strong>* BOC REVIEW: </strong>The Bank of Canada held rates at 1.75%, as was widely expected, noting that there is increased uncertainty about the timing of future rate hikes; previously, the BOC was favouring a gradual path of hikes. The Bank said also the outlook continues to warrant a policy rate that is below its estimate of neutral.

However, Pantheon Macroeconomics provides the usual caveats in extrapolating the data for the official NFP print on Friday: \"ADP is back-fitted to the official numbers, which is why January's number has been revised up to 300K from 213K,\" Pantheon writes, \"ADP's methodology means that some of that strength will have filtered into the Feb reading, so the relatively modest 183K increase suggests that the data gleaned from firms which use ADP's payroll processing services was on the soft side.\" Pantheon looks for the official BLS payroll number to be around 125k, which it says would be a correction following January's blockbuster beat. \"We think the Jan official number was elevated by favourable weather effects and double-counting of federal government workers taking second jobs during the shutdown. Looking ahead, the trend in labour demand appears consistent with payroll growth in the high 100s.\" It is also worth mentioning the chunky upside revision to the prior month's ADP data; Moody's Zandi has stated that this was on the back of annual benchmark revisions, and therefore, some caution is required when using it to evaluate the strength of the data.</p><p><strong>* ECB PREVIEW: </strong>ECB Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45 GMT, (13:45 CET, 07:45 EST), On Thursday 7th March 2019, Press Conference Due At 13:30 GMT, (14:30 CET, 08:30 EST): • Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. • Inflation and growth forecasts set to be lowered. • Will the Bank provide any further clarity on potential new TLTROs? <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21309/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview</a></p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>An ECB sources story circulated today which reported the central bank is to lower their growth outlook in order to justify new liquidity financing (TLTROs).</p><p><strong>* US TRADE DEFICIT:</strong> The US trade deficit widened to a decade high in December (USD 59.8bln from USD 49.3bln). Nominal exports fell for the sixth month in seven; imports rebounded, rising the most in ten months. Oxford Economics said that moderating global momentum and protectionist trade policies will keep weighing on exports in the near-term, which will add further pressure to the deficit. Oxford Economics adds that import growth is also likely to ease this year, in line with the broader cooling of economic activity.</p><p><strong>* BOE: BOE's Cunliffe (dove) </strong>said an extremely disorderly Brexit is the biggest risk facing the UK financial sector; said the BOE does not expect a disorderly Brexit, but it would almost certainly lead to a decline in UK asset prices and losses for banks. <strong>BOE's Saunders (hawk)</strong> said it is possible that monetary tightening may be needed in the future, not necessarily now; said it makes sense to wait and see how Brexit unfolds and that policy could go either way post-Brexit, although he is certain monetary policy could not prevent damage to the economy from a no-deal Brexit. Saunders added that UK households will likely return to the recent trend if the Brexit deadline is to be extended by a couple of years.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Following UK’s Cox and Barclay meeting with EU’s Barnier, there were reports that the talks were “cordial but immovable”, raising concerns of the likelihood of a breakthrough, with Barnier saying that no solution on the Irish border had been made and that the talks were difficult. It was also reported that the UK sees early Monday as the deadline for talks with the EU. There were details of two proposals that Barnier rejected from Cox, though there was little passthrough.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLES $0.34 LOWER AT $56.22/BBL, BRENT (K9) SETTLES $0.13 HIGHER AT $65.99/BBL. </strong>Crude prices traded rather sideways again on Wednesday. The market continues to face a decreasing global demand function with the OECD confirming the negative shift in the outlook by cutting its 2019 world growth forecast to 3.3% from 3.5%. However, analysts at Citi noted, “these periodic forecasts have earned a reputation for following or reflecting the consensus rather than revealing a new trend… we wouldn’t view it with alarm.” The market saw some volatility on the release of the DOE inventory data, which confirmed last night’s API reported strong build in crude stocks, where official crude stocks for the end of last week built by 7.1mln bbls, larger than the expected build of 1.2mln bbls, but slight lower than the API’s recorded build of 7.29mln; Cushing stocks built by 0.9mln bbls, API reported it as building by 1.1mln bbls; distillates drew larger than expected at -2.4mln bbls; gasoline stocks also drew larger than expected at -4.2mln bbls. US production was unchanged for the week at record highs of 12.1mln BPD. Elsewhere, oil supplies from Libya's El Sharara (300k BPD capacity, but currently producing around 80k BPD) could resume as early as 9 March.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.65% at 2771, NDX -0.62% at 7112, DJI -0.51% at 25674. SECTORS: Energy -1.28%, Materials +0.20%, Industrials -0.94%, Cons Discretionary -0.56%, Cons Staples -0.10%, Healthcare -1.47%, Financials -0.71%, Tech -0.55%, Telecoms -0.01%, Utilities +0.04%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Aon (AON) surged on the open after announcing that it was not looking to acquire Willis Towers Watson (WLTW), seeing WLTW tank, contradicting reports from Tuesday. LyondellBasell (LYB) benefitted from an upgrade at Goldman. Dollar Tree (DLTR) beat top- and bottom-line estimates but lowered guidance, however surged on the announcement of it closing/rebranding 600 stores. Ross Stores (ROST) outperformed on strong earnings and a USD 2.5bln share buyback announcement. Tobacco names Phillip Morris (PM) and Altria (MO) opened higher after Trump confirmed the resignation of FDA Commissioner and e-cigarette hardliner Scott Gottlieb. General Electric (GE) continued its slide on Wednesday after JPMorgan analyst gave a pessimistic outlook. Brown-Forman (BF.B) nosedived following a miss on revenue and average EPS guidance. Exxon Mobil (XOM) traded near the bottom of the DJIA as it held its annual investor’s day conference, where it announced USD 4bln extra capex for the year ahead. Conversely, DowDuPont (DWDP) traded near the top of the DJIA on news it would begin an acceleration of its share repurchase programme in April, following the spin-off of its agriscience unit.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (H9) SETTLE 8 TICKS AT 121-30. </strong>Nomura's quant desk has noted the sluggishness in the global rates market. \"CTAs seem to have reduced their long positions on the major DM bond futures market, but systematic selling pressure in bond futures is relatively subdued,\" noting that \"for 10-year US Tresauries, CTAs' net position on the 10-year UST futures (TY) is close to 'flat' or slightly short,\" and that \"as downward price momentum in TY is not so strong, systematic trend-followers have currently refrained from chasing market downside by adding short positions.\" That sluggishness was not apparent today, and Treasuries bull steepened as equities dropped on reported CTA selling. Today's price action seemed sentiment driven rather than event driven, with more timely reminders about the slowing global growth narrative (OECD cut outlook on Weds, BOC talked about uncertainties, Aussie GDP was soft overnight, the Beige Book mentions of \"slow\"). There was talk of CTA buying after a dovish ECB sources story. Action stalled in the afternoon on reports of profit taking.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Buck traded higher, though so does the JPY slightly, which analysts at SocGen say nicely encapsulates the mixed mood of the market. Traders were still citing the ISM non-manufacturing print, released Tuesday, which had a decent headline, some of the components (new orders, employment, for instance) slipped, auguring poorly for Friday's payrolls, as well as ISM non-mfg prints over the coming months. There was some positivity after the ADP data saw a large upward revision to the prior, though that was most likely on benchmark revisions. There is a feeling that the USD is waiting more clarity on the economic front from Friday’s payrolls.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Commerzbank points out that USD bears are having a tough time; yesterday, the buck benefited from a decent ISM headline, while the EUR largely ignored positive developments from the PMIs. The bank notes, however, that the USD positive effects are unlikely due to Fed pricing, which has been quite stable since mid-January. Instead, Commerz posits that it is Thursday's ECB meeting which is keeping traders cautious. \"We consider it to be likely that the ECB will at least indicate a further LTRO, a step that at first glance would seem to justify a weaker euro as it constitutes an expansionary step,\" the bank wrote, \"we nonetheless view the euro scepticism on the market critically - in the end the ECB is likely to stick to its view that things are looking up economically and as far as inflation is concerned, even if it has to lower its forecast.\" The kicker is that the new funding measures would not signal a new period of looser ECB policy, and the central bank appears to have little wiggle-room: \"Its key rate is already close to the effective lower bound and further asset purchases are limited due to the legal limits,\" Commerz says, \"of course the latter is not cast in stone, but the ECB is only likely to want to change that in a real emergency. That should limit the euro’s depreciation potential.\"</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>There were more dovish noises from the BOJ's Harada overnight, who again made the case for the BOJ to loosen policy in the event that economic developments threaten the central bank's ability to bring inflation to target. But there was nothing for the yen during European and US hours that did anything that break the wafer thin range (around 30 pips on Wednesday!).</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> With no outcome after Tuesday's meeting in Brussels between UK Attorney General Fox and EU negotiator Barnier, and suggestions from the EU side that the meeting did not go well, combined with further reports of proposals UK AG Cox presented to Barnier (that were rejected) GBP started the day on a softer footing, and remains slightly negative ass we approach APAC trade. Some desks have suggested that Tuesday's and today's talks in Brussels are pivotal, since the outcome of next week's series of Meaningful Votes will depend on it (if the EU failed to make further concessions, the theory is that UK PM May might not be able to secure the backing of coalition partner DUP, and the Brexiteer contingent of her own party, the ERG). And Commerzbank says that even if a no deal is taken off the table at next week's votes, uncertainty would still remain as to what would happen in the case A50 was delayed.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The CAD was spanked on a dovish BOC, and rose to highs around 1.3450 as it appeared that they dropped their hiking bias (which might not strictly be the case, see BOC section, above) which has certainly softened its bias to normalise policy, even if it hasn't completely given up the ghost of future rate hikes. The risk is now of an additional aggressive move after tomorrow's Economic Progress Report, to be delivered by BOC dep gov Patterson. \"We continue to feel that the CAD is undervalued from a longer-term perspective but also acknowledge the risk of weakness over the next month or so as we head into the April 24 policy decision and MPR forecast update,\" Scotiabank says, \"We view USDCAD gains to 1.3600 as a selling opportunity.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> A soft GDP print overnight saw the Aussie fall as low as 0.7022, with weakness in housing and the consumer sectors driving the data. Numerous desks have now pencilled in RBA rate cuts (corroborated by comments from the central bank's governor Lowe, who overnight said it is hard to envisage a scenario where Australian rates would need to go up this year). The GDP data itself signals that Australia was growing at around a 1% annualised pace in the second half of 2018 vs an annualised pace of around 4% in H1 2018, Wesptac has noted (the bank was among the first to have trimmed its RBA rate cut profile last week, ahead of the latest GDP data and RBA meeting). Westpac says \"the challenge for the Reserve Bank will be to credibly maintain its GDP growth forecasts at 3.0% in 2019 and 2.75% in 2020. The Aussie itself has found support above 0.70 ; on the upside, the 200dma (0.7120 region). However, it is worth stepping back and looking at the bigger picture: SocGen's FX strategists note that \"GDP data were weak, though from a glance at the headlines and the angst, I'd never have guessed the miss was a 2.3% annualised rate, rather than the 2.5% consensus,\" adding that \"on a Q/Q basis that's a 0.05% miss, which is statistically irrelevant. It says more about mood than the economy.\"</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> Some desks have been critical of the RBA goveror Lowe, whose optimistic outlook has been confounded by the soft overnight GDP data. UBS thinks there are other central bank governors whose hawkishness needs to be dialed back, and have identified RBNZ governor Orr as perhaps one of the chief culprits (FWIW, Riksbank's Ignves was also named!). \"It will, in my opinion, end in a similar fate as with most of the softening G-10 economies,\" UBS FX traders said, \"but the element of surprise may be for Kiwi which the market has not pre-emptively sold ahead of a potential revision of monetary outlook. Kiwi has been tough to gauge this year given the shortage of Kiwi data and so far the pair has mostly traded in tandem with Aussie, given the near perfect equilibrium of the cross at 1.04ish.\" The Swiss bank notes that the timing will be tricky, given they are making a medium-term call, but initially are looking for the NZD to move towards 0.65, before a fall sub-0.63.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Yesterday's GDP data was a mixed bag, but crucially there was not a lot of positives to walk away from (consumption and investment components have got some alarm bells ringing). It seems traders are now looking to rating reviews on the slate for the end of March, ahead of elections on 8 May. More immediately, EMs under pressure was not helping the rand on Wednesday, and the woes at state utility Eskom continue to weigh.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> Turkish Lira only got a temporary lift as the CBRT maintained a tightening bias until such time that inflation returns to target, and renewed its pledge to hike again if required. However, following hot on the heels of sub-forecast CPI, and with the Finance Ministry promptly predicting that inflation will fall faster that previously estimated this year, Usd/Try rebounded sharply from around 5.3650 to almost 5.4400 at one stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Today's price action seemed sentiment driven rather than event driven, with more timely reminders about the slowing global growth narrative (OECD cut outlook on Weds, BOC talked about uncertainties, Aussie GDP was soft overnight, the Beige Book mentions of \"slow\"). There was talk of CTA buying after a dovish ECB sources story. Action stalled in the afternoon on reports of profit taking.</p>",

        "subject": "FX ANALYSIS: AUD, CAD slammed",
        "content": "<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Buck traded higher, though so does the JPY slightly, which analysts at SocGen say nicely encapsulates the mixed mood of the market. Traders were still citing the ISM non-manufacturing print, released Tuesday, which had a decent headline, some of the some components (new orders, employment, for instance) slipped, auguring poorly for Friday's payrolls, as well as ISM non-mfg prints over the coming months. There was some positivity after the ADP data saw a large upward revision to the prior, though that was most likely on benchmark revisions. There is a feeling that the USD is waiting more clarity on the economic front from Friday’s payrolls.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Commerzbank points out that USD bears are having a tough time; yesterday, the buck benefited from a decent ISM headline, while the EUR largely ignored positive developments from the PMIs. The bank notes, however, that the USD positive effects are unlikely due to Fed pricing, which has been quite stable since mid-January. Instead, Commerz posits that it is Thursday's ECB meeting which is keeping traders cautious. \"We consider it to be likely that the ECB will at least indicate a further LTRO, a step that at first glance would seem to justify a weaker euro as it constitutes an expansionary step,\" the bank wrote, \"we nonetheless view the euro scepticism on the market critically - in the end the ECB is likely to stick to its view that things are looking up economically and as far as inflation is concerned, even if it has to lower its forecast.\" The kicker is that the new funding measures would not signal a new period of looser ECB policy, and the central bank appears to have little wiggle-room: \"Its key rate is already close to the effective lower bound and further asset purchases are limited due to the legal limits,\" Commerz says, \"of course the latter is not cast in stone, but the ECB is only likely to want to change that in a real emergency. That should limit the euro’s depreciation potential.\"</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>There were more dovish noises from the BOJ's Harada overnight, who again made the case for the BOJ to loosen policy in the event that economic developments threaten the central bank's ability to bring inflation to target. But there was nothing for the yen during European and US hours that did anything that break the wafer thin range (around 30 pips on Wednesday!).</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> With no outcome after Tuesday's meeting in Brussels between UK Attorney General Fox and EU negotiator Barnier, and suggestions from the EU side that the meeting did not go well, combined with further reports of proposals UK AG Cox presented to Barnier (that were rejected) GBP started the day on a softer footing, and remains slightly negative ass we approach APAC trade. Some desks have suggested that Tuesday's and today's talks in Brussels are pivotal, since the outcome of next week's series of Meaningful Votes will depend on it (if the EU failed to make further concessions, the theory is that UK PM May might not be able to secure the backing of coalition partner DUP, and the Brexiteer contingent of her own party, the ERG). And Commerzbank says that even if a no deal is taken off the table at next week's votes, uncertainty would still remain as to what would happen in the case A50 was delayed.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The CAD was spanked on a dovish BOC, and rose to highs around 1.3450 as it appeared that they dropped their hiking bias (which might not strictly be the case, see BOC section, above) which has certainly softened its bias to normalise policy, even if it hasn't completely given up the ghost of future rate hikes. The risk is now of an additional aggressive move after tomorrow's Economic Progress Report, to be delivered by BOC dep gov Patterson. \"We continue to feel that the CAD is undervalued from a longer-term perspective but also acknowledge the risk of weakness over the next month or so as we head into the April 24 policy decision and MPR forecast update,\" Scotiabank says, \"We view USDCAD gains to 1.3600 as a selling opportunity.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> A soft GDP print overnight saw the Aussie fall as low as 0.7022, with weakness in housing and the consumer sectors driving the data. Numerous desks have now pencilled in RBA rate cuts (corroborated by comments from the central bank's governor Lowe, who overnight said it is hard to envisage a scenario where Australian rates would need to go up this year). The GDP data itself signals that Australia was growing at around a 1% annualised pace in the second half of 2018 vs an annualised pace of around 4% in H1 2018, Wesptac has noted (the bank was among the first to have trimmed its RBA rate cut profile last week, ahead of the latest GDP data and RBA meeting). Westpac says \"the challenge for the Reserve Bank will be to credibly maintain its GDP growth forecasts at 3.0% in 2019 and 2.75% in 2020. The Aussie itself has found support above 0.70 ; on the upside, the 200dma (0.7120 region). However, it is worth stepping back and looking at the bigger picture: SocGen's FX strategists note that \"GDP data were weak, though from a glance at the headlines and the angst, I'd never have guessed the miss was a 2.3% annualised rate, rather than the 2.5% consensus,\" adding that \"on a Q/Q basis that's a 0.05% miss, which is statistically irrelevant. It says more about mood than the economy.\"</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> Some desks have been critical of the RBA goveror Lowe, whose optimistic outlook has been confounded by the soft overnight GDP data. UBS thinks there are other central bank governors whose hawkishness needs to be dialed back, and have identified RBNZ governor Orr as perhaps one of the chief culprits (FWIW, Riksbank's Ignves was also named!). \"It will, in my opinion, end in a similar fate as with most of the softening G-10 economies,\" UBS FX traders said, \"but the element of surprise may be for Kiwi which the market has not pre-emptively sold ahead of a potential revision of monetary outlook. Kiwi has been tough to gauge this year given the shortage of Kiwi data and so far the pair has mostly traded in tandem with Aussie, given the near perfect equilibrium of the cross at 1.04ish.\" The Swiss bank notes that the timing will be tricky, given they are making a medium-term call, but initially are looking for the NZD to move towards 0.65, before a fall sub-0.63.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Yesterday's GDP data was a mixed bag, but crucially there was not a lot of positives to walk away from (consumption and investment components have got some alarm bells ringing). It seems traders are now looking to rating reviews on the slate for the end of March, ahead of elections on 8 May. More immediately, EMs under pressure was not helping the rand on Wednesday, and the woes at state utility Eskom continue to weigh.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> Turkish Lira only got a temporary lift as the CBRT maintained a tightening bias until such time that inflation returns to target, and renewed its pledge to hike again if required. However, following hot on the heels of sub-forecast CPI, and with the Finance Ministry promptly predicting that inflation will fall faster that previously estimated this year, Usd/Try rebounded sharply from around 5.3650 to almost 5.4400 at one stage.</p>",

The Bank said also the outlook continues to warrant a policy rate that is below its estimate of neutral. It also conceded that the slowdown in Q4 was sharper and roader than had been expected, and talked of uncertainty for the H1 2019.</li><li>\"In the face of broad based disappointments in recent economic growth both at home and abroad, the Bank of Canada had little choice but to water down its warnings of higher interest rates ahead,\" Canadian bank CIBC said, \"but this was not a full surrender to those, including us, who feel that any rate hikes should be off the table.\"</li><li>CIBC notes that the central bank only acknowledged that the timing of future rate hikes was now uncertain, and it would \"take time to gauge the persistence\" of the slower pace to growth that has been seen in the data. \"A full waving of the white flag on its early hawkish view would have seen the Bank discuss the 'timing and direction of future rate changes', and Governor Poloz was at this point not willing to take that larger step,\" CIBC says.</li><li>With that said, CIBC says that having earlier put all the blame on temporary factors like NAFTA uncertainties, the Bank of Canada has conceded that there are more forces at play, both at home and abroad, in dulling Canada’s growth picture. \"Its discussion today zeroed in on the near stall in Q4 GDP growth, but the reality has been that, even in the prior four quarters, growth was only running at potential despite interest rates being well below the Bank's estimate of the neutral rate, evidence in our view that monetary policy settings (including their impact on the exchange rate) aren’t as stimulative at these levels as Governor Poloz believes.\"</li><li>CIBC also points out that the BOC continues to argue that trade tensions are 'weighing heavily' and that their resolution would be a significant turning point globally and for Canada. \"But it's also admitting that 'it is difficult to disentangle' the magnitude of the trade uncertainty drag from other factors that are slowing global growth. And it’s extended that to the home front, by noting that domestic demand was weaker than they expected, both from households and business,\" CIBC says.</li><li>Looking ahead, the BOC was projecting growth of 0.8% in Q1, and it is likely that on it's latest commentary, the Bank will likely trim its view, and perhaps reconsider the pace for Q2. CIBC says that it is now implied that the BOC will stand pat on rates into at least mid-year, but still doesn't rule out a rate hike later in the year. For what it is worth, Canadian OIS have now priced in around 20% chance of a rate CUT by September.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CAD/TRY/PLN</strong></p><p>All awaiting guidance from March Central Bank meetings, and the Loonie extended losses through 1.3400 vs its US counterpart as the BoC qualified further rate hikes warranted with heightened uncertainty over the timing and an acknowledgement that Q4 GDP was significantly weaker than anticipated, and more widespread. Moreover, growth in the first half of 2019 is seen slower than predicted in January, pushing Usd/Cad up to circa 1.3455 and 60+ pips above pre-BoC levels (not far from the 67 pip break-even indicated via options). Meanwhile, the Turkish Lira only got a temporary lift as the CBRT maintained a tightening bias until such time that inflation returns to target, and renewed its pledge to hike again if required. However, following hot on the heels of sub-forecast CPI, and with the Finance Ministry promptly predicting that inflation will fall faster that previously estimated this year, Usd/Try rebounded sharply from around 5.3650 to almost 5.4400 at one stage. In stark contrast, an unchanged NBP rate decision as widely expected left the Zloty relatively steady circa 4.3000.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the Loonie and Lira’s travails, downbeat GDP data, RBA comments and a raft of dovish bank predictions along the lines of Westpac’s 50 bp easing before year end has hauled the Aussie closer to the 0.7000 handle vs its US peer, and deeper through 1.0400 vs the <strong>NZD</strong> even though the Kiwi was dragged down in sympathy. Indeed, Nzd/Usd is nearer the base of a 0.6800-0.6755 range, as the broad Greenback maintains bullish momentum, albeit with the <strong>DXY</strong> fading around 97.000 again amidst mixed US data.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Some demand resurfacing for the safe-havens, and the Yen in particular as global stocks continue to wobble, and Usd/Jpy retreats from its latest 112.00+ venture to a slightly deeper recent low (111.67). Meanwhile, the Franc has pared more losses vs the Dollar from a marginal new recent low of 1.0055 towards 1.0030.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Both ending Wednesday’s EU session narrowly mixed vs the Usd after volatile, but relatively rangebound trade, with the single currency pivoting 1.1300 again and Cable flitting either side of 1.3150. A dovish ECB source report pushed Eur/Usd briefly and marginally through yesterday’s low, but the headline pair held ‘comfortably’ above deeper sub-big figure support levels and subsequently came back strongly. Note, a 1.1305 Fib could be key on a closing basis. Back to the Pound, breaking Brexit headlines and reports continue to direct in the main and the latest batch were somewhat conflicting as usual. However, although the EU is not expecting any real progress from withdrawal deal discussions this week it seems that latest negotiations may not have been as frosty as some suggested.</p>",

The 10 year UK bond has eased back from a new 126.48 Liffe high in line with USTs that have absorbed some decent block sales, while Bunds have also waned after retesting their 163.49 Eurex peak as the Eurozone periphery benefits most from the latest TLTRO talk. Elsewhere, the Dollar has ebbed and flowed after a seemingly upbeat NFP proxy in the form of ADP, but worse than forecast trade data and benchmark revisions to the former that flattered the back month upgrade. However, the single currency has arguably been even more volatile on the aforementioned dovish ECB story, which may well be too optimistic and leave Eur bears short and caught.</p>",

Nomura believes that some fast-money participants are wary of short-term return reversals and have just started to sell stocks proactively. In addition, 3-month 110%/90% skew of the VIX option has been rising, and a majority of options investors may have anticipated the upside risk in the VIX index. Nomura strategist says \"As I try to emphasize short-term fluctuations in market prices, I aim to place more emphasis on the latter signs.\"</li><li>CTA profit-taking: Nomura says systematic trend-followers such as CTAs seem to have started taking profits on their long positions in US stock futures after the S&amp;P500 started correcting immediately after having breached over ~2800. \"Although systematic selling pressure on the US equity market by CTAs is currently limited, we estimate the breakeven level for their existing long positions is ~2,750 on the S&amp;P500 and ~1,555 on the Russell2000, respectively, which are potential tipping points for encouraging mechanical liquidation by CTAs.\"</li><li>Nomura estimates \"global Macro HFs have also built a small short position in US equities as the US economic surprise index deteriorated (-33 points as of yesterday),\" and as a result, \"overall hedge fund exposure to the US equity market has been levelling off as well.\"</li><li>The bank notes that since end-February, upward momentum in the US stock market has unexpectedly recovered with the help of other investors' stock buying. \"Our previous call for CTAs' profit-taking did not materialize. Therefore, we present a conditional forecast that selling pressure from technical-based investors such as CTAs will only be dominant if there are no positive events and factors to induce other investors, especially medium- and long-term participants, to buy US equities further.\"</li><li>On risk sentiment, Nomura says that \"the net-leverage ratio of global hedge funds has stayed around 100% so far. Risk-taking by hedge funds has gradually recovered or the net-leverage ratio has increased, but remains in a normal state.\" Nomura doubts that HFs have taken on excessive risk in the risk-rally environment of the past two months, and says \"in a risk scenario, where the global stock market has a major correction, it is less necessary to watch out for hedge funds de-leveraging, such that it encourages significant selling of risk assets.\"</li></ul>",

Usd/Jpy is back below 112.00 after what appears to have been a false break-out to circa 112.12 yesterday (and also a fleeting Fib breach), but the pull-back could be shallow given 1.2 bn option expiries running off from 111.80-112.00 at the NY cut. The Franc is holding just off 1.0055 lows and pivoting 1.1350 vs the single currency, while Eur/Usd remains anchored around 1.1300 with 1.1305 eyed as a key chart point on a closing basis and expiries also in the mix as 1 bn resides at the 1.1300 strike.</p>",

Gilts kicked off at 126.24 and reached an early Liffe peak of 126.31 before slipping back to 126.15 in line with Bunds and US Treasuries. Note, the 10 year German debt future has now been as low as 163.15, and perhaps acknowledging another encouraging PMI print as the construction sector rebounded firmly from just above the 50.0 mark in February. Back to Liffe, similar price action along the 3 month strip, albeit within narrower confines ahead of more MPC speakers and probably a more balanced to neutral or dovish tone via Cunliffe and Haldane vs renowned hawk Saunders. Prior to that, DMO issuance to make some room for amidst a heavy corporate, institutional and non-UK sovereign pipeline as Gbp3 bn 2024 supply goes under the hammer.</p>",

Note, Bunds and other Eurozone bond futures have now officially switched to June from March alongside volumes and open interest, with the new front month contract up to 163.49 at best, so far, and corresponding yield pulling back further from recent peaks around 0.20% to a fraction below 0.15%. An overall downturn in risk sentiment, albeit somewhat selective, has prompted renewed demand for core debt, as US-Chinese trade deal euphoria continues to dissipate, Brexit remains up in the air and US-NK relations appear less cordial after the breakdown of talks between Trump and Kim last week. Ahead, no Eurozone data as the clock ticks down to the ECB tomorrow.</p>",

(FT)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, <strong>DXY </strong>initially eased from post-ISM highs wherein the index tested 97.000 to the upside and straddled around 2-week highs. <strong>AUD</strong> was the marked underperformer after being dealt a series of blows, with below-forecast <strong>Australian Q4 GDP signalling that the country officially entered a “per capita” recession</strong> for the first time since 2006. The <strong>Aussie</strong> was originally pressured by Governor Lowes reiteration of his neutral stance whilst he also noted that is hard to see an RBA rate hike this year. This coupled with the disappointed GDP caused <strong>AUD/USD</strong> to plummet before testing 0.7050 to the downside. Another hit was dealt after JP Morgan downgraded their RBA rate forecast to two 25bps rate cuts in July and August 2019, in-line with Nomura’s forecast. Hence, <strong>AUD/USD</strong> saw another leg lower and extended losses below 0.7050 to a low just shy of 0.7025, and in sympathy, <strong>NZD/USD</strong> fell below its 50 DMA (at 0.6796) and 100 DMA (at 0.6768) to a sub-0.6760 low. Barclays analysts noted that they are watching the Aussie labour market data for the three months, and if unemployment rates start to rise towards the 5.3-5.5% area, then the analysts believe the RBA will consider cutting rates by 25-50bps in H2 2019. However, Barclays left their base case unchanged at zero cuts this year, for now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The move in <strong>AUD/USD</strong> pushed <strong>DXY</strong> higher towards the 96.980 level and subsequently, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> slipped below 1.1300 ahead of major support at 1.1280. Meanwhile, <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was initially dented by source reports that the EU and UK failed to reach an agreement yesterday’s talks, but the pair fell below the 1.3150 level amid the Aussie-induced <strong>USD</strong> strength. Furthermore, the <strong>JPY</strong> experienced gains which coincides with comments from US National Security Advisor Bolton, who stated that the US will increase sanctions on North Korea if there are no movements towards denuclearisation, although the demise of <strong>AUD/JPY</strong> was also a factor for the <strong>Yen</strong> strength, amid a decline from 79.24 highs to a sub-78.60 low ahead of its 50 DMA at 78.39. Finally, <strong>CAD</strong> was amongst the laggards, albeit to a lesser extent, due to the aforementioned pick-up in the greenback coupled with the decline in the energy complex, ahead of the BoC interest rate decision later today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The energy market was on the back-foot following the much wider-than-expected build in API crude inventories alongside a firmer greenback. <strong>WTI</strong> futures tested USD 56.00/bbl to the downside while <strong>Brent</strong> futures declined below USD 65.50/bbl. Analysts also attributed some downside to Chevron and Exxon’s production forecasts upgrades, in which the former expects shale output from the Permian Basin to reach 600K BPD by the end of next year, +59% from current production. Meanwhile Exxon forecasts production of 1mln BPD from the same basin by 2024. As usual, traders will be eyeing today’s DoE release as shale production remains at record highs. Elsewhere, metals were mixed as <strong>gold</strong> held onto most of the prior day’s gains ahead of today’s ADP report, whilst <strong>copper</strong> fell upon the release of the Australian GDP. Furthermore, Chinese <strong>steel</strong> and <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> <strong>futures</strong> edged higher after China's top steel-making city Tangshan extended production curbs on steel mills due to air pollution. Finally, <strong>nickel</strong> posted gains for a fourth consecutive day as low stock levels and a rebound in demand kept the base material at six-month highs.</p><p>US National Security Adviser Bolton said US is looking at fresh sanctions against Venezuela to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Maduro's government.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks are relatively mixed following a muted lead from Wall Street in which the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq all closed just below breakeven. ASX 200 (+0.5%) advances as the material and mining sectors lead the gains, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) underperforms as the index is weighed on by a marginally firmer domestic currency alongside China-exposed sectors after China’s announcement of tax cuts yesterday. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (Unch) and Hang Seng (Unch) are little changed as the upside from yesterday’s NPC announcement is neutralised by the overall negative narrative surrounding the region amid a slew of disappointing data.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY eased off post-ISM highs wherein the index tested 97.000 to the upside and straddled around 2-week highs. As such EUR/USD is largely dictated by the buck and hovers just around 1.1300 ahead of major support at 1.1280. Meanwhile, GBP/USD was dented and trades 1.3150 amid source reports that the EU and UK failed to reach an agreement yesterday’s talks, but the two negotiating teams are to reconvene today. Elsewhere, AUD was dealt another blow, as below-forecast Australian Q4 GDP signalled that the country officially entered a “per capita” recession for the first time since 2006. The Aussie was initially pressured as Governor Lowe reiterated his neutral stance whilst also noting that is hard to see an RBA rate hike this year. AUD/USD plumbed the depths to test 0.7050 to the downside, hitting levels last seen in early January, hence in a sympathy move, NZD/USD fell below its 50 DMA at 0.6796 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.6768. Furthermore, the JPY experiences mild safe-haven gains which coincides with comments from US National Security Advisor Bolton who stated that the US will increase sanctions on North Korea if there is no movement towards denuclearisation, which came amid reports that North Korea are rebuilding a missile site. Finally, CAD is amongst the laggards, albeit to a lesser extent, amid the decline in the energy complex ahead of the BoC interest rate decision later today.</p>",
