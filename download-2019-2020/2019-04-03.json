Furthermore, BoE's Carney said he will do everything to support the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit but suggested the financial sector was not among the worries in a no-deal scenario, while he added that he would absolutely not stay in his post past the planned January 2020 departure.

Verizon (VZ) caught a bid as it rolled out its new 5G mobile network. Caterpillar (CAT) and Raytheon (RTN) opened lower after downgrades at Deutsche Bank and UBS respectively.

Indeed, growth concerns have ebbed slightly, which is also reflected in the 3m/10yr spread remaining positive. Major curve spreads were a touch steeper.

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 3 April 2019: Risk-on fades after mixed ISM, ADP miss",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities mixed, dollar down, Treasuries down, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> Decent Caixin PMIs, EZ PMIs spark risk-on; enthusiasm curbed by mixed ISM, ADP miss.</p><p><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>German Industrial Orders; ECB Minutes; US Initial Jobless Claims; RBI Rate Decision; Fed's Williams, Mester &amp; Harker Speaking; Supply from Spain &amp; France; US 3,10 &amp; 30yr Refunding Announcement.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>NEC Director Kudlow leaned slightly on the optimistic trade headlines which have landed over the last few days, stating that \"we are not there on a deal\" but hope to get closer this week. He also said that no decision has been made on potential auto tariffs, and the 90-day review period could be extended. Earlier in the session, the US Ag Sec Perdue said talks were down to the last few days. In later trade, reports suggested that the US wanted binding China pledges which are enforced by tariffs, with a target of 2025 for China to meet trade pledges; US also wants timetable for China purchases and market access.</p><p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS: </strong>ADP reported 129k payrolls were added to the US economy in March, disappointing the consensus looking for 175k. Pantheon Macroeconomics reminds us that ADP's model incorporates prior official payroll data as well as information from firms which use its payroll processing services, so it’s possible that the fluke 25K private payroll number for February pulled down the March ADP. \"Frustratingly, the influence of the prior month’s official numbers is impossible to isolate consistently in advance,\" Pantheon writes, \"usually, the effect of weak official numbers on the next ADP reading is seen in the month after severe weather events -- February's survey week was much colder than January's, relative to seasonal norms -- and typically the official number for the month after the weather event is stronger than ADP.\" Pantheon goes on to say that the first alternative story, in which ADP has captured a real downshift in payroll growth, cannot be ruled out, \"but is very hard to square with the survey evidence and the newly-revised, lower, jobless claims numbers,\" and \"the final possibility is that greater-than-usual snow cover in March, relative to February -- adjusted for seasonal norms -- hit March payrolls, despite only modestly colder-than-usual temperatures,\" and the uncertainty here is huge, \"so prudence dictates that we nudge down our forecast for the official number to about 160K from 180K, but this is a very tricky call.\"</p><p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING: </strong>The non-manufacturing ISM was a mixed bag, with the headline falling to a 19-month low (56.1 vs exp 58.0 and prev. 59.7). Business activity and new orders fell, though employment rose after a large slip in February. However, Oxford Economics said it remains encouraged by the details of the report that paint a rather healthy and stable picture of the services sector at the end of Q1: \"Non-manufacturing activity is now consistent with a healthy but moderating economic momentum, with the average in the first quarter at 57.5 compared with 59.5 in Q4 2018,\" the consultancy said, \"in fact, the March downshift in services activity to a more reasonable pace is in line with our expectations for economic growth to gradually cool to around 2.0% y/y by the end of 2019,\" it adds.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK lawmakers will vote on the Cooper/Letwin bill at 2200 BST; the Bill aims to block a no deal Brexit, despite the fact that such a legal assurance would need to also be agreed by the EU as well. From the bloc's perspective, EU President Juncker on Wednesday said that UK Parliament must approve the Withdrawal Agreement by next Friday if it wanted another short extension to the Article 50 Brexit process (EU policymakers will, in fact, need to see an outline of what the UK wants by 10 April, in order to deliberate on the details before the emergency EU meeting on 12 April). Talks between the UK government and the opposition Labour Party have begun, and will continue on Thursday; there has been little concrete progress, though commentary was generally constructive; however, in late trade, sources said that talks with Labour were not as “constructive” as had been claimed.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES $0.12 LOWER AT $62.46; BRENT (M9) SETTLES $0.06 LOWER AT $69.31. </strong>The oil complex traded firm in early trade, underpinned by news that US/China talks were making solid progress on the demand-side, while reports continue to focus on the OPEC supply cut pact on the supply-side which are tightening the market; Russia will reportedly reach the output cut level it agreed with OPEC in April, its energy minister said. The complex was also happy to look through Tuesday's API inventory data, which showed a surprise build. However, the complex found it more difficult to ignore the weekly DOE inventory data, which showed a surprise build larger than that reported by the API (crude +7.2mln, Cushing +0.2mln, distillates -2.0mln, gasoline -1.8mln). Elsewhere, Kuwait is assessing damage at its Mina Abdullah refinery (270k BPD) after a fire. Traders were also continuing to focus on Aramco's bond prospectus released on Tuesday, which showed lower production capacity from the Ghawar oilfield, the world's largest conventional oilfield; \"While Aramco did not revise down official production capacity of 12mb/d, the greater proportion of spare capacity attributable to Saudi’s long tail of smaller fields will raise questions about how realistic the capacity figure is,\" UBS said. Looking ahead, the bank believes that oil prices will continue to be supported in Q2 by gradually pricing in sentiment and supportive fundamentals.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.2% at 2873, NDX +0.6% at 7545, DJI +0.2% at 26218. SECTORS: Energy -1.0%, Materials +1.3%, Industrials -0.3%, Cons Discretionary +0.7%, Cons Staples -0.6%, Healthcare -0.1%, Financials +0.3%, Tech +0.8%, Telecoms +0.4%, Utilities -0.2%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Chipmakers<strong> </strong>were the star performing sector on Wednesday, where AMD (AMD) lead the pack after a bullish outlook article in DigiTimes, in addition to receiving a positive mention at Nomura; the likes of Intel (INTC), Micron (MU) and Nvidia (NVDA) also followed suit. Verizon (VZ) caught a bid as it rolled out its new 5G mobile network. Caterpillar (CAT) and Raytheon (RTN) opened lower after downgrades at Deutsche Bank and UBS respectively. Nielsen (NLSN) traded higher after reports a final bidding offer had been made for it by a buyout firm. Urban Outfitters (URBN) surged on an upgrade at DA Davidson. Boeing (BA) traded lower following Baird saying it expects Wall Street to lower its EPS estimates for the co. following the 737 MAX jet crashes. Game Stop (GME) nosedived after disappointing earnings and guidance.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLES 8+ LOWER AT 123-16.</strong> The constructive risk environment resulted in higher yields. The usual suspects -- optimism about the prospects of a China/US trade deal, less chance of no deal Brexit, decent services PMIs out of china and Europe, and a decent retail sales report out of the latter -- were cited, and the TPLEX was happy to look through a sub-par ADP report, and a mixed non-manufacturing ISM. Indeed, growth concerns have ebbed slightly, which is also reflected in the 3m/10yr spread remaining positive. Major curve spreads were a touch steeper.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The Buck was lower amid risk-on (see USD section below). EUR was higher amid the USD weakness, while some bargain hunting was cited after reasonable data (PMI and retail sales). GBP was higher, despite lawmakers rejecting a plan to hold more indicative votes on Monday; traders await the outcome of the Cooper/Letwin motion to rule out no deal Brexit (results expected around 2200 BST), and are generally encouraged by May's cross-party approach (see below). Aussie traded up on a combination of retail sales beating overnight, China data continuing to show stabilisation, iron ore prices jumping higher, as well as the overall constructive risk tone. RUB could not participate in the EMFX rally, with US Senators reintroducing a Russian sanctions bill. TRY also could not participate in the EMFX rally, with US Vice President Pence. The national emergency in the US has seen strong rhetoric towards Mexico, which today weighed on the MXN (see below for detailed analysis).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* USD, EMFX:</strong> A risk-on environment resulted in the DXY trading negative. Some have wondered how much the buck is being swayed by the bouts of risk-on seen in recent weeks, given the moves seem relatively benign. However, analysts have noted that the US maintains a relative yield attraction, and thus, other major G10 FX might struggle to make ground against the buck.

EUR was higher amid the USD weakness, while some bargain hunting was cited after reasonable data (PMI and retail sales). GBP was higher, despite lawmakers rejecting a plan to hold more indicative votes on Monday; traders await the outcome of the Cooper/Letwin motion to rule out no deal Brexit (results expected around 2200 BST), and are generally encouraged by May's cross-party appoach (see below). Aussie traded up on a combination of retail sales beating overnight, China data continuing to show stabilisation, iron ore prices jumping higher, as well as the overall constructive risk tone. RUB could not participate in the EMFX rally, with US Senators reintroducing a Russian sanctions bill. TRY also could not participate in the EMFX rally, with US Vice President Pence. The national emergency in the US has seen strong rhetoric towards Mexico, which today weighed on the MXN (see below for detailed analysis). &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* USD, EMFX, EUR: </strong>A risk-on environment resulted in the DXY trading negative. Some have wondered how much the buck is being swayed by the bouts of risk-on seen in recent weeks, given the moves seem relatively benign.

However, Morgan Stanley takes the more negative view: \"We want to make it clear that now is the time to sell the USD as we see China rebounding economically, which should soon spill over into better EM growth,\" the bank writes.

The complex was also happy to look through Tuesday's API inventory data, which showed a surprise build. However, the complex found it more difficult to ignore the weekly DOE inventory data, which showed a surprise build larger than that reported by the API (crude +7.2mln, Cushing +0.2mln, distillates -2.0mln, gasoline -1.8mln). Elsewhere, Kuwait is assessing damage at its Mina Abdullah refinery (270k BPD) after a fire. Traders were also continuing to focus on Aramco's bond prospectus released on Tuesday, which showed lower production capacity from the Ghawar oilfield, the world's largest conventional oilfield; \"While Aramco did not revise down official production capacity of 12mb/d, the greater proportion of spare capacity attributable to Saudi’s long tail of smaller fields will raise questions about how realistic the capacity figure is,\" UBS said. Looking ahead, the bank believes that oil prices will continue to be supported in Q2 by gradually pricing in sentiment and supportive fundamentals.</p>",

Trump has walked this commentary back over the past few days, perhaps because his team has reportedly tried to explain that shutting every border crossing would have a crippling knock-on effect to the economies of US border states,\" but with that said, UBS notes that the migrant issue is not going to go away. But UBS sees more risks on that the USMCA agreement will not be ratified: \"The market has assumed this is a done deal, when it most definitely is NOT. Back in the summer of 2018, when the US and Mexico were finalizing the trade negotiations, MXN rallied by over 12% against the USD, in what was largely a broad USD-stronger environment (as well as some unwind of the market's AMLO election fears).\" UBS warns that if the deal falls apart, downside risks could be significant; bookies' odds imply the deal has around 30% chance of being ratified - it was at over 80% at the start of the year. \"Nancy Pelosi is unlikely to give Trump a win on trade this year, and even more unlikely in the 2020 election year, so it is understandable that the chance this passes the House is cratering by the day.\"</p>",

PM May will not be going to the 1922 Committee meeting tonight (Trade Secretary Fox will be going instead)</i></p><p><strong>*LATEST:</strong> Last night, Theresa May said the UK will need a further extension of A50 to ensure it leaves in a timely way with a deal and will try to complete legislation by May 22nd. She added that she is taking action to break the logjam and offered to sit down with opposition Labour leader Corbyn to hopefully reach a solution that delivers on the referendum and if they cannot agree on a single unified approach, they could agree on a set of arrangements to put to the house and that the government would abide by Parliament’s decision. The labour leader stated he was “very happy” to conduct talks with the Premier. Number 10 are reportedly pressing to get a new deal through the House of Commons by the weekend, according to BBC’s Norman Smith.</p><p><strong>*MAY’S PLAN:</strong></p><ul><li>Decide on a plan with the Labour party to make sure UK leaves the EU with a deal</li><li>Put that plan through the HoC, win approval (hopefully) and present the deal to the EU27 on April 10th</li><li>If the HoC cannot agree on a plan, PM proposes joint options for parliament to vote on (i.e. indicative votes)</li><li>Once a plan is sorted, follow up with legislation for UK to leave on 22nd May, avoiding a partake in European Parliamentary elections</li></ul><p><strong>*CORBYN’S STANCE</strong>: As cross-party talks commence today, Labour leader Corbyn noted that his talks with the PM will include:</p><ul><li>An EU customs union and market access</li><li>Ensuring the Good Friday Agreement</li><li>Workers’ rights</li></ul><p>N.B. Earlier today, Labour MP Long-Bailey noted that Corbyn not set red lines in discussions with PM May.</p><p><strong>*NO-DEAL BILL:</strong>&nbsp; Against the backdrop of all the above, a cross party group of MPs (led by Labour MP Cooper and Tory MP Letwin) are to later present a bill to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The bill requires PM May to put forth a proposal to extend Article 50 beyond April 12th to avoid a no-deal crash (PM May highlighted that she would like an extension). MPs intent to force the bull through all its stages in the Commons, as it usually takes weeks/months for a bill to clear in parliament. Specifically the <strong>LETWIN/COOPER BILL </strong>is aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit by forcing the Government to extend the Brexit process beyond April 12th. The bill is split in 3 sections;</p><ul><li>Requires the UK PM to bring a motion to the HoC the day after the bill passes seeking an extension of any chosen length.</li><li>MPs are then free to change the date, binding the Govt.</li><li>If the EU responds with a different delay period, the PM must propose a fresh motion to the Commons.</li></ul><p>The ex-head of Downing Street Legislative Affairs Da Costa believes, however, that there will not be enough time for the bill to pass prior to the emergency 10th April European Council Summit</p><p><i>N.B. 1 UK government could potentially accept the Cooper deal in some form, according to sources via </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickkmaguire/status/1113422810284793856\"><i>New Statesman's Maguire</i></a></p><p>N.B. 2 In the event of a long A50 extension (end-March 2020) and the UK holding European Parliament elections, EU will likely “freeze” negotiations until the end of the year, i.e. until UK agrees WA with an amended political declaration, possibly after a general election or a referendum,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/status/1113424956401029120\"> according to BuzzFeed's Nardelli citing source</a>s</p><p><strong>*AMENDMENTS [TBC]:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>(A) BENN :</strong> Proposes indicative votes on Monday</li><li><strong>TORY MPS:</strong> Delay Brexit debate until Thursday 11th</li><li><strong>TORY MPS 2:</strong> Bill can only proceed if agreed by two-thirds of MPs at the second reading</li></ul><p><i>N.B.

However, the DXY is holding around 97.000 as Dollar rivals pare some of their best gains made in the wake of a stellar Caixin PMI overnight, positive US-China trade talk updates and mostly above forecast EU services PMIs.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars are off best levels, but still well ahead of their major counterparts on a combination of the bullish impulses listed above, and in the case of the Aussie also upbeat retail sales and trade data. Aud/Usd has formed a firmer recovery base above 0.7100 and did not get too distracted by option expiries in hefty size residing from 0.7100-10 (1.6 bn), while Nzd/Usd inched a but closer to 0.6800 with the Aud/Nzd cross holding steady just under 1.0500.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also heading into the end of Wednesday’s EU session down from peaks vs the Greenback, as the single currency faded only a few pips above yesterday’s 1.1250 high after the aforementioned Eurozone services PMI beats, while the Franc lost momentum ahead of 0.9950, albeit rebounding through 1.1250 vs the Euro even though SNB’s Maechler reiterated the need for negative Swiss rates and active currency market monitoring/intervention. Elsewhere, Cable retreated just a few pips shy of 1.3200 on a wave of optimism about an end to the Brexit stalemate after UK PM May turned to opposition leader Corbyn to try and forge a compromise, with a shock contraction in the services PMI also sapping some of Sterling’s strength. Note, the meeting between Tory and Labour heads is now underway and then Parliament will vote on whether yet another motion (Letwin-Cooper) should be tabled before IVs later tonight – see Ransquawk’s headline feed for more. The Loonie slipped back from circa 1.3295 highs towards 1.3330 along with oil after another unexpected US inventory build (and EIA significantly bigger than API last night), and as the pair failed to sustain declines through the 100 DMA (1.3313).</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The sole G10 loser vs the Usd as the headline pair stuck mainly to the top end of a 111.57-21 range and never really troubled big option expiries just below the base at 111.15 (2.3 bn).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>More travails for the Try that bucked the broader recovery trend again, as Turkish CPI surpassed consensus and angst between the US and Turkey over the latter’s S-400 Russian order cranked up. Conversely, the Zar managed to shrug a weak SA services PMI and the Mxn got a welcome boost from positive US-Mexican border noises.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>This week’s risk roller-coaster continues, and the latest turn of the ride has lifted stocks and high beta currencies to the detriment of so-called safe havens, like the Dollar and core bonds. Hence, the Greenback has handed back gains made on Tuesday vs most G10 counterparts and EMs, with the index retreating towards 97.000 again from just over 97.500. The catalysts, another strong Chinese PMI and similar beats across the Eurozone/Europe, bar the UK, reports that the US and China are getting close to a trade agreement and Brexit developments raising prospects of some kind of deal as opposed to no deal.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi have benefited most from the resurgence in broad risk appetite, with the former also deriving independent impetus from data in the form of retail sales and trade overnight. Aud/Usd has recovered from near 2019 lows to 0.7100+, but may be hampered by more hefty option expiry interest as 1.6 bn runs off between 0.7100-10 at the NY cut. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is hovering just below 0.6800 compared to sub-0.6750 at worst as the Aud/Nzd cross holds close to the upper end of a 1.0495-50 range.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Usd following underperformance yesterday, with the single currency boosted by better than expected Eurozone services PMIs across the board and marginally topping Tuesday’s 1.1250 peak, but capped by layered off said to be sitting up to 1.1270. Cable tested the water and resistance into 1.3200 on the back of the aforementioned Brexit manoeuvres aimed at reaching a pact to trigger an extension from April 12 that could lead to a softer withdrawal agreement or terms. However, the Pound was derailed to a degree by a significantly weaker than forecast UK services PMI as the headline recoiled below 50 and IHS predicted this means Q1 GDP stagnation before a downturn in H2. The Loonie continues to recoup losses vs its US peer post-contrasting manufacturing PMIs/ISM on Monday with the aid of firmer crude prices and the overall rebound in risk sentiment to probe over 1.3300, while the Franc is back up around 0.9960 from parity at one stage on Tuesday, but softer vs the Eur within 1.1177-1.1208 trading parameters after more dovish/intervention talk from the SNB.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are still tracking broader swings in risk, along with technical and fundamental impulses, as Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok retreat towards recent lows and chart support levels circa 10.4100 and 9.6000 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira remains embroiled in political uncertainty as the main parties wrangle over regional election results against the backdrop of renewed diplomatic angst between Turkey and the US, while latest inflation data has piled more pressure on the Try and CBRT given a firmer than forecast CPI rate. Unsurprisingly, Usd/Try is holding above 5.6100 vs other Usd/regional pairings that are reversing recent rallies, and even the Rand in wake of a weak SA services PMI.</p>",
