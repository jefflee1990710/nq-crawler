The complex was a function of sentiment on trade, often whipsawed by tweets from the US President, as well as China press. The positive sentiment unwind gains that the TPLEX made on Friday â€“ there was some buying in wake of a the April CPI data, which did not show any signs of â€˜transitoryâ€™ weakness. Nevertheless, on the week, 10-year yields have slipped by 8bps, the sharpest weekly fall in seven weeks. At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch steeper.
