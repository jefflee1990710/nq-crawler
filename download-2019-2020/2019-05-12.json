The complex was a function of sentiment on trade, often whipsawed by tweets from the US President, as well as China press. The positive sentiment unwind gains that the TPLEX made on Friday – there was some buying in wake of a the April CPI data, which did not show any signs of ‘transitory’ weakness. Nevertheless, on the week, 10-year yields have slipped by 8bps, the sharpest weekly fall in seven weeks. At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch steeper. US T-notes (M9) futures settled unchanged at 123-31+.</p>",
