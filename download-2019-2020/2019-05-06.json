(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Nearly every stock in the Nasdaq 100 opened in the red after the return of ‘Tariff Man’ put the prospect of a US/China deal (which would have increased the certainty surrounding their international supply chains) in doubt. Apple (AAPL) opened lower, with the stock price also weighed down by news that the iPhone maker is to be investigated buy the European Commission on an antitrust basis after Spotify (SPOT) issued a formal complaint. Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) also opened in negative territory after US President Trump took a swipe at the social media platforms for their de-platforming of controversial right-wing activists. IBM (IBM) stock prices could not reverse pre-market losses despite news emerging that the technology co. expects to complete the acquisition of Red Hat by the end of the year. Tesla (TSLA) reversed early losses, despite news emerging that the electric car maker will not have its China-manufactured computer for the Model 3 removed from the basket of goods that may be subject to US President Trump’s upcoming 25% tariff. Lyft (LYFT) shares came under pressure pre-market, as it emerged that drivers working for ride hailing technology companies are planning to strike this week over pay and working conditions. It was not just the technology sector that felt the burn as the threat of tariffs re-emerged. Industrials suffered such as 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) all suffered. Boeing (BA) was also weighed down by a plethora of negative headlines; another 737 MAX plane crashed over the weekend (this time, thankfully, non-lethally) and damning stories emerged that the aircraft maker had been taking shortcuts regarding the safety of its 737 MAX aircraft. Disney (DIS) managed to reverse early losses, after the entertainment co. finalised the sale of 21 of its regional sports networks and ticket sales for ‘Avengers: Endgame’ broke more records over the weekend. Pfizer (PFE) managed to reverse early trade tension related losses after the pharma co. announced approval from the FDA for some of its new headline drugs. One of few stocks to make significant gains on the day, Anadarko (APC) accepted an improved offer from Occidental (OXY), the offer which carries a 23% premium over Chevron’s (CVX) original offer. Chevron (CVX) and Occidental (OXY) shares both moved higher on the news. SPX -0.4% at 2933, NDX -0.7% at 7794, DJI -0.3% at 26437.</p><p>After the US President threw his trade toys out of the pram over the weekend, volumes and therefore moves were lacklustre as fixed income traders saw little reward to trading the now binary possibilities of a US/Sino deal/no deal (in addition to multiple market holidays). As such treasuries saw little volatility as the President’s huffing and puffing gave a tailwind to fixed income futures, which steadily climbed throughout the session in thin ranges. Harker also failed to add impetus after largely reiterating Fed guidance, stating that inflation dampening effects are likely transitory, and saw 10yrs close with gains of around 9 ticks and the curve moderately steeper. As such traders are likely looking ahead to a trading week set to be chock-full of trade talk deliberations and upcoming USD 84bln worth of supply this week kicked off by USD 38bln in 3yrs tomorrow. US T-note futures (M9) settled 9 ticks higher at 123-20+</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT:</strong> Equities down, Dollar flat, Treasuries up, Crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>Trade talks steel the limelight, Chinese delegation to travel to US despite Trump threats, stocks pare losses on thin volumes, Turkey to re-run local elections in Istanbul</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> AU Retail Sales, RBA Rate Decision, GE Industrial Orders, EC Economic Forecast, US Jolts Jobs Openings, CA Ivey PMI, API Weekly Crude Stocks, EIA Short Term Energy Outlook, BoE’s Cuncliffe &amp; Haldane, Fed’s Kaplan &amp; Quarles, Riksbank’s Ingves</p><p><strong>* TUESDAY’S EARNINGS:</strong> Allergan, Emerson Electrical, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Primoris Services, AB Inbev, BMW, CNH Industrial, Infineon, Intesa Sanpaolo, Henkel, Hannover RE, Pandora, Ferrari, Siemens Gamesa</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE:</strong> US-China trade has become the main theme of today, and very likely for the rest of the week (at least), with weekend tweets from US President Trump who ramped up tensions with China by stating that the current 10% tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods will be hiked to 25% on Friday. Furthermore, the US President also noted that the currently untaxed USD 325bln worth of goods will be subject to 25% tariffs, although the exact timeframe of this is unknown. Reportedly, Trump’s twitter threats came amid USTR Lighthizer telling the US President last week that Beijing were backtracking on the deal. China’s response has not, as of yet, included any threats to hike tariffs on their side, although there were reports that the country was mulling cancelling trade discussions with the US, scheduled for this week. Moreover, Reports from SCMP noted that Vice Premier Liu He could delay his trip to Washington by three days and shorten discussions to just one day. Markets reacted to the news as expected, stock markets plummeted with China the marked underperformer as Shanghai Comp slid in excess of 5% whilst Shenzhen plummeted 7.5%. The follow-through to the European and US markets were also material but to a much lesser extent. FX markets were also impacted with most majors losing ground vs. the Greenback and USD/CNH gapping higher at 6.8200 (vs. Friday’s close of sub-6.7400) at the open, whilst T-note futures opened higher by 12 ticks and WTI futures fell 2%. Since then, sources stated that a small Chinese delegation will be heading to Washington for dialogue despite Trump’s threats, although it is still unclear whether Vice Premier Liu He will be part of that delegations. Analysts at ING still expect a deal to happen as they note that the tweets are more of a negotiating strategy, albeit a risky one. Meanwhile, Danske Bank note that the implications of a trade war on the stock markets will pressure the two sides to find some sort of common ground in terms of a deal.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY</strong>: The ongoing election saga had a blowout breakthrough in Monday’s session after an AK party representative stated that elections are to be re-run in the no-longer-AKP-ruled Istanbul. After multiple sessions of consternation with the calamitous results for the incumbent Government, a rationale for a re-run was reached, and cited crony polling counters as the reason. With the re-run now officially confirmed, Turkey watchers will now look forward to the slated June 23rd reset date, with Erdogan’s Government finally given some minor respite.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 62.25/BBL; BRENT (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.39 HIGHER AT USD 71.24/BBL</strong>. The energy market has nursed the downside seen at the electronic trade open as the soured tone from trade tensions somewhat waned amid looming supply woes emanating from Iranian and Venezuelan sanctions alongside the ongoing OPEC-led production cuts ahead of the JMMC meeting this month. The energy complex edged higher in the US session following a report via Axios which noted that Israel has passed intelligence to the White House about a potential Iranian plot to attack US interests in the Gulf. US Acting Defence Secretary highlighted the US will hold Iran accountable for any attack on US forces or interests, whilst Secretary of State Pompeo noted that the US continues to see Iranian activity that suggests an escalation. Due to the possible ramifications of the latest developments, with scope for tighter Iranian sanctions, oil is poised to end the session in the green and above USD 71.50/BBL for Brent and WTI above USD 62.50/BBL. Analysts at BAML agree that the rally in energy prices have been supply driven, with OPEC+ production contracting by 2.2mln BPD since the OPEC pact in November 2018. The analysts envisage Brent remaining above USD 70/BBL as Iranian oil exits the market, although they expect Saudi to slowly replace the missing barrels.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.4% at 2933, NDX -0.7% at 7794, DJI -0.3% at 26437. SECTORS: Communications -0.8%, Cons Discretionary -0.6%, Cons Staples -0.2%, Energy -0.1%, Financials -0.7%, Healthcare +0.6%, Industrials -1%, Materials -1.4%, Tech -0.8%, Telecoms -0.2%, Utilities -0.6%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Nearly every stock in the Nasdaq 100 opened in the red after the return of ‘Tariff Man’ put the prospect of a US/China deal (which would have increased the certainty surrounding their international supply chains) in doubt. Apple (AAPL) opened lower, with the stock price also weighed down by news that the iPhone maker is to be investigated buy the European Commission on an antitrust basis after Spotify (SPOT) issued a formal complaint. Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) also opened in negative territory after US President Trump took a swipe at the social media platforms for their de-platforming of controversial right-wing activists. IBM (IBM) stock prices could not reverse pre-market losses despite news emerging that the technology co. expects to complete the acquisition of Red Hat by the end of the year. Tesla (TSLA) reversed early losses, despite news emerging that the electric car maker will not have its China-manufactured computer for the Model 3 removed from the basket of goods that may be subject to US President Trump’s upcoming 25% tariff. Lyft (LYFT) shares came under pressure pre-market, as it emerged that drivers working for ride hailing technology companies are planning to strike this week over pay and working conditions. It was not just the technology sector that felt the burn as the threat of tariffs re-emerged. Industrials suffered such as 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) all suffered. Boeing (BA) was also weighed down by a plethora of negative headlines; another 737 MAX plane crashed over the weekend (this time, thankfully, non-lethally) and damning stories emerged that the aircraft maker had been taking shortcuts regarding the safety of its 737 MAX aircraft. Disney (DIS) managed to reverse early losses, after the entertainment co. finalised the sale of 21 of its regional sports networks and ticket sales for ‘Avengers: Endgame’ broke more records over the weekend. Pfizer (PFE) managed to reverse early trade tension related losses after the pharma co. announced approval from the FDA for some of its new headline drugs. One of few stocks to make significant gains on the day, Anadarko (APC) accepted an improved offer from Occidental (OXY), the offer which carries a 23% premium over Chevron’s (CVX) original offer. Chevron (CVX) and Occidental (OXY) shares both moved higher on the news.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-20+.</strong> After the US President threw his trade toys out of the pram over the weekend, volumes and therefore moves were lacklustre as fixed income traders saw little reward to trading the now binary possibilities of a US/Sino deal/no deal (in addition to multiple market holidays). As such treasuries saw little volatility as the President’s huffing and puffing gave a tailwind to fixed income futures, which steadily climbed throughout the session in thin ranges. Harker also failed to add impetus after largely reiterating Fed guidance, stating that inflation dampening effects are likely transitory, and saw 10yrs close with gains of around 9 ticks and the curve moderately steeper. As such traders are likely looking ahead to a trading week set to be chock-full of trade talk deliberations and&nbsp; upcoming USD 84bln worth of supply this week kicked off by USD 38bln in 3yrs tomorrow.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> was relatively rangebound as it continued to recover off its post NFP lows, seeing slight upside as US traders arrived at their desks to digest the weekend’s events but ultimately finishing the session relatively flat. <strong>JPY</strong> was the main G10 beneficiary amid the risk off start to the week, in which USDJPY gapped back below the 111.00 handle and nearly hit 110.00. The Yen did later weaken, as the risk sentiment somewhat improved whilst European and US stocks came off their lows. <strong>EUR </strong>held up well vs the majority of its G10 counterparts, with the notably exception of the Yen, the eurozone currency supported by promising Markit Comp/Services PMI data this morning. <strong>GBP </strong>weakened throughout the day, following comments from senior Labour figures, who threw cold water over the prospect of an imminent cross-party breakthrough. <strong>AUD/NZD</strong>, having both been hit after the re-emergence US tariff threats, could not recover the weekend’s losses vs USD, with the prospect of rate cuts later this week in both economies undermining any recovery. The Aussie ultimately consolidated just below the psychologically important 0.7000 handle. Conversely, the Scandi crowns, <strong>NOK </strong>and<strong> SEK</strong>, did manage to recover most of the weekend’s losses as oil prices staged a recovery, stronger than expected PMI data from their European neighbours lifted spirits and market expectations for the Norges Bank to maintain a hiking bias in their meeting later this week remained firmly intact. On the EM front, <strong>TRY</strong> took a beating as news emerged that Turkish AK Party representatives to the high election board ruled in favour of re-running of local elections in Istanbul, USDTRY convincingly breaking the 6.0000 level for the first time since last November. <strong>CNH</strong>, which had weakened substantially in the aftermath of the Trump tweets, continued to recoup losses vs USD throughout the session, a recovery assisted by news that a Chinese delegation would travel to the US for negotiations despite.</p>",

The energy complex edged higher in the US session following a report via Axios which noted that Israel has passed intelligence to the White House about a potential Iranian plot to attack US interests in the Gulf. US Acting Defence Secretary highlighted the US will hold Iran accountable for any attack on US forces or interests, whilst Secretary of State Pompeo noted that the US continues to see Iranian activity that suggests an escalation. Due to the possible ramifications of the latest developments, with scope for tighter Iranian sanctions, oil is poised to end the session in the green and above USD 71.50/BBL for Brent and WTI above USD 62.50/BBL. Analysts at BAML agree that the rally in energy prices have been supply driven, with OPEC+ production contracting by 2.2mln BPD since the OPEC pact in November 2018. The analysts envisage Brent remaining above USD 70/BBL as Iranian oil exits the market, although they expect Saudi to slowly replace the missing barrels.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Dollar bounces from post-NFP lows as Trump raises US-China tariff stakes",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Greenback has regained some composure after Friday’s fall from grace on benign AHE vs healthy payroll gains, with the index just off best levels between 97.708-484 trading parameters and only the safer-haven Yen outperforming in G10 land. The catalyst has been renewed strains on the US-China trade front after President Trump scotched recent reports suggesting that a deal may be in the offing by repeating threats to increase tariffs on Usd200 bn Chinese imports to 25% from 10% as soon as this Friday and warning that a further Usd325 bn could follow.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, Usd/Jpy has bucked the broader trend and remains off recent highs within a 110.30-97 range as broad aversion saw stocks and other risk assets shunned. However, the headline pair has rebounded ahead of a cluster of technical supports between 110.31-34, including 2 Fibs and a cloud base.</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/AUD/CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Pound has now lost grip of the 1.3100 handle to test bids ahead of short term chart support around 1.3077 and after Cable failed to breach Fib resistance at 1.3116 as the Brexit limbo continues in UK holiday thinned conditions, while the non-US Dollars have all been hit by the risk-off start to the new week and concerns the global repercussions of US-China trade escalations, let alone a full blown tariff war. Aud/Usd has pared some losses to retest offers/supply ahead of 0.7000, but not quite enough to seriously test decent option expiry interest between the big figure and 0.70015 (1 bn). However, the Aussie still looks cautious in advance of Tuesday’s RBA policy meeting with rate cut odds relatively low, but perhaps not quite as ‘live’ as the looming RBNZ as Nzd/Usd hovers just above 0.6600 – for full previews of both see the Ransquawk Research Suite. The Loonie remains nearer the base of a 1.3493-29 range even though crude prices have regrouped, and elsewhere the Scandi Crowns are also underperforming in the anti-risk atmosphere, with Eur/Nok elevated between 9.7495-8050 and Eur/Sek from 10.6865 to 10.7400 in wake of a slowing Swedish services PMI.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>The single currency and Swiss Franc have been a bit more resilient vs the Usd and in cross terms in the case of the latter. Eur/Usd has held up pretty well within a 1.1204-1.1161 raneg with the aid of more encouraging Eurozone macro news in the form of most services PMIs, retail sales and Sentix sentiment, while Usd/Chf has been capped just under 1.0200 and Eur/Chf saw a stop-run down to just a few pips off 1.1350 and the 200 DMA (1.1345) before revisiting 1.1400. Back to Eur/Usd, hefty option expiries may have influenced trade as 1.6 bn and 1.1 bn rolled off at the NY cut from 1.1150-60 and 1.1185-1.1200 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Regional currencies have been on the back foot for the most part on broader safe-haven positioning, but Usd/Zar has extended gains ahead of the midweek SA elections to 14.5000+ vs some consolidation in Usd/Try and Usd/Chh from 6.0400 and 6.8200+ at one stage, with the Lira slipping through the psychological level following another call from the AKP to rerun the Istanbul local election and worrying remarks from the CBRT concerning inflation (PPI having a bigger impact on CPI).</p>",

Furthermore, China’s potential cancellation of this week’s trade discussions in Washington added to the pressure for equity futures and in turn wiped out all of Friday’s gains from the Goldilocks jobs report. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.8%)</strong> was negative with the index led lower by underperformance in tech and with the top-weighted financials sector also pressured amid losses in ‘Big 4’ bank Westpac after it reported a 24% drop in H1 statutory profit. Elsewhere, all components in the <strong>Hang Seng (-3.5%)</strong> were negative and the <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-5.2%)</strong> slumped heavily due to the renewed tariff threats which reportedly could shed 1.5% off China’s GDP growth, while a PBoC liquidity injection and targeted RRR cut for small and medium-sized banks, as well as mixed Caixin Services and Composite PMI data did little to brighten the sentiment in China.

However, subsequent comments from China’s Foreign Ministry, that they hope the US can meet China halfway on trade talks and that the delegation are preparing to go to the US, did generate a glimmer of positivity across markets. Although, it is still unclear if Vice Premier Liu He will feature in this delegation. Losses across European indices are broad based with no standout under/out performer, and a similar scene is present across sectors. Although, luxury names such as Christian Dior (-3.7%) and Kering (-3.0%) are heavily weighed on by the increased US-China trade tensions. Similarly, auto names are lower due to their supply chains being particularly vulnerable to trade tensions, Volkswagen (-3.5%) have been hit the hardest, with the Co’s CEO previously stating that import tariffs from the US on the EU could cost the Co. billions of euros each year. Other notable movers this morning include ThyssenKrupp (-4.2%) amidst reports that EU anti-trust regulators are likely to block the Co’s proposed merger with Tata Steel due to concerns over potential price increases and the impact on competition; the proposed merger would create Europe’s second largest steel producer and follows comments from Tata Steel’s European Works Council that they do not believe the merger is in the best interest of the Co’s workers. At the other end of the Stoxx 600, and today’s only notable mover in positive territory are Telenor (+4.0%) following reports that the Co. and Axiata have initiated discussions to merge their Asian operations with the Co. likely to own 56.5% of the merger.</p><p><strong>Boeing (BA) </strong>has stated that it knew of a problem with its 737 Max jets around a year prior to the aircraft being involved in an accident, &nbsp;but that they did not take any action on this &nbsp;Stating that they inadvertently made an alarm feature optional, instead of making it a standard feature; though continue to insist that that should not impact flight safety. Elsewhere, 737 plane skidded off a runway and into a river, after landing heavily in a thunderstorm in Florida. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>JPY/CHF - While the Usd holds above Friday’s post-NFP lows and the DXY pivots around 97.500, safe-haven positioning in wake of latest US-Chinese trade developments and a diplomatic spat between the 2 nations over naval vessels in the South China Sea has heightened demand for the Yen and Franc. Following Trump tweets threatening to imposes higher tariffs on Usd200 bn worth of Chinese goods this Friday with a further Usd325 bn possibly subject to increased levies, Usd/Jpy reversed through 111.00 and all the way down to circa 110.30, while stops are said to have been tripped in Eur/Chf on a break of 1.1370 pushing the cross towards 1.1350 and the 200 DMA (1.1345). However, some respite has tempered aversion as China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry says a delegation is still preparing to head to Washington this week and subsequently seen rebounds to around 110.70 and 1.1375 respectively.</p><p>GBP/AUD/CAD/NZD/NOK/SEK - The main G10 underperformers and casualties of the broad risk off start to the new week, as Cable probes support ahead of 1.3100 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and the UK public holiday, while the Aussie, Loonie and Kiwi are all trying to stabilise following declines to 0.6963, 1.3493 and 0.6601. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are also maintaining a defensive stance in the run up to RBA and RBNZ policy meetings that are both expected to be ‘live’ in terms of easing prospects, while the deterioration in US-China relations has also undermined oil to the detriment of the Cad and Nok (latter down near 9.8000 vs the Eur). Back down under, hefty option expiry interest may provide support and resistance in Aud/Usd given 1.1 bn at the 0.6950 strike and 1 bn at 0.7000-15. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek is elevated around 10.7200 on the back of another soft Swedish PMI as the services headline dips, albeit still comfortably above the 50.0 threshold unlike manufacturing.</p><p>EUR - Conversely, an upward revision to the final pan Eurozone services PMI despite mixed national surveys, slightly firmer than expected retail sales data and an encouraging Sentix Index have all helped the single currency contain losses within a 1.1200-1.1160 range vs the Dollar. Note also, decent option expiry interest could be keeping the headline pair rangebound as 1.6 bn runs off between 1.1150-60 vs 1.1 bn from 1.1185-1.1200.</p><p>EM - Widespread losses vs the Greenback amidst the aforementioned generally sour sentiment, as Usd/Cnh rallies through 6.8000 at one stage vs the PBoC’s official 6.3744 Usd/Cny fix, while Usd/Zar tests offers ahead of 14.5000 in advance of Wednesday’s SA elections and Usd/Try peers over 6.0000 on the ongoing and well documented Turkish, plus CBRT concerns about (higher) PPI cost pressures exerting and increasingly stronger influence on CPI.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The risk premium in Bunds and US Treasuries continues to fade even though stocks and Italian bonds remain under pressure on the flare up in US-China trade wars and political wrangling in Rome. The 10 year German debt future is sitting just above a 165.37 low and almost ½ point off best levels, while US equivalents have retreated from their overnight session, albeit still holding a firmer bid awaiting the return of Wall Street with futures pointing to very heavy losses. Back to Italy, BTPS look vulnerable through early May lows, but have retained 130.00+ status by a whisker in wake of a sub-50 composite PMI.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.3%) have also succumbed to the general risk tone, although are currently trading within a relatively thin band with prices having recovered from overnight lows which were just a shade below USD 69/bbl and just above the USD 60/bbl levels respectively. Aside from the all-encompassing US-China story news flow for the complex has been somewhat thin, notably Saudi Aramco raised their OSP for all crude grades to all regions (ex-US) for June, with Arab Light’s price falling by USD 0.10/bbl for the US.</p><p>Gold (+0.3%), along with other safe havens, has benefitted from the increased US-China tension and the resulting risk off sentiment, with the yellow metal now trading towards the middle of a USD 7/oz range which did see it reach USD 1287/oz. Copper, has suffered as the metals largest buyer China returned to market, after a 3-day Labour Day holiday last week, with China playing catchup and sentiment being impacted by updates regarding the potential increase or imposition of tariffs on China. Iron ore port holdings in China fell 1.8% to 133.6mln tons which is the lowest since October 2017. (Newswires)</p>",

Similarly, auto names are lower due to their supply chains being particularly vulnerable to trade tensions, Volkswagen (-3.7%) have been hit the hardest, with the Co’s CEO previously stating that import tariffs from the US on the EU could cost the Co. billions of euros each year. Other notable movers this morning include ThyssenKrupp (-4.5%) amidst reports that EU anti-trust regulators are likely to block the Co’s proposed merger with Tata Steel due to concerns over potential price increases and the impact on competition; the proposed merger would create Europe’s second largest steel producer and follows comments from Tata Steel’s European Works Council that they do not believe the merger is in the best interest of the Co’s workers. At the other end of the Stoxx 600, and today’s only notable mover in positive territory are Telenor (+4.1%) following reports that the Co. and Axiata have initiated discussions to merge their Asian operations with the Co. likely to own 56.5% of the merger.</p><p>FX</p><p>JPY/CHF - While the Usd holds above Friday’s post-NFP lows and the DXY pivots around 97.500, safe-haven positioning in wake of latest US-Chinese trade developments and a diplomatic spat between the 2 nations over naval vessels in the South China Sea has heightened demand for the Yen and Franc. Following Trump tweets threatening to imposes higher tariffs on Usd200 bn worth of Chinese goods this Friday with a further Usd325 bn possibly subject to increased levies, Usd/Jpy reversed through 111.00 and all the way down to circa 110.30, while stops are said to have been tripped in Eur/Chf on a break of 1.1370 pushing the cross towards 1.1350 and the 200 DMA (1.1345). However, some respite has tempered aversion as China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry says a delegation is still preparing to head to Washington this week and subsequently seen rebounds to around 110.70 and 1.1375 respectively.</p><p>GBP/AUD/CAD/NZD/NOK/SEK - The main G10 underperformers and casualties of the broad risk off start to the new week, as Cable probes support ahead of 1.3100 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and the UK public holiday, while the Aussie, Loonie and Kiwi are all trying to stabilise following declines to 0.6963, 1.3493 and 0.6601. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are also maintaining a defensive stance in the run up to RBA and RBNZ policy meetings that are both expected to be ‘live’ in terms of easing prospects, while the deterioration in US-China relations has also undermined oil to the detriment of the Cad and Nok (latter down near 9.8000 vs the Eur). Back down under, hefty option expiry interest may provide support and resistance in Aud/Usd given 1.1 bn at the 0.6950 strike and 1 bn at 0.7000-15. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek is elevated around 10.7200 on the back of another soft Swedish PMI as the services headline dips, albeit still comfortably above the 50.0 threshold unlike manufacturing.</p><p>EUR - Conversely, an upward revision to the final pan Eurozone services PMI despite mixed national surveys, slightly firmer than expected retail sales data and an encouraging Sentix Index have all helped the single currency contain losses within a 1.1200-1.1160 range vs the Dollar. Note also, decent option expiry interest could be keeping the headline pair rangebound as 1.6 bn runs off between 1.1150-60 vs 1.1 bn from 1.1185-1.1200.</p><p>EM - Widespread losses vs the Greenback amidst the aforementioned generally sour sentiment, as Usd/Cnh rallies through 6.8000 at one stage vs the PBoC’s official 6.3744 Usd/Cny fix, while Usd/Zar tests offers ahead of 14.5000 in advance of Wednesday’s SA elections and Usd/Try peers over 6.0000 on the ongoing and well documented Turkish, plus CBRT concerns about (higher) PPI cost pressures exerting and increasingly stronger influence on CPI.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The risk premium in Bunds and US Treasuries continues to fade even though stocks and Italian bonds remain under pressure on the flare up in US-China trade wars and political wrangling in Rome. The 10 year German debt future is sitting just above a 165.37 low and almost ½ point off best levels, while US equivalents have retreated from their overnight session, albeit still holding a firmer bid awaiting the return of Wall Street with futures pointing to very heavy losses. Back to Italy, BTPS look vulnerable through early May lows, but have retained 130.00+ status by a whisker in wake of a sub-50 composite PMI.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.3%) have also succumbed to the general risk tone, although are currently trading within a relatively thin band with prices having recovered from overnight lows which were just a shade below USD 69/bbl and just above the USD 60/bbl levels respectively. Aside from the all-encompassing US-China story news flow for the complex has been somewhat thin, notably Saudi Aramco raised their OSP for all crude grades to all regions (ex-US) for June, with Arab Light’s price falling by USD 0.10/bbl for the US.</p><p>Gold (+0.3%), along with other safe havens, has benefitted from the increased US-China tension and the resulting risk off sentiment, with the yellow metal now trading towards the middle of a USD 7/oz range which did see it reach USD 1287/oz. Copper, has suffered as the metals largest buyer China returned to market, after a 3-day Labour Day holiday last week, with China playing catchup and sentiment being impacted by updates regarding the potential increase or imposition of tariffs on China.</p>",

Furthermore, China’s potential cancellation of this week’s trade discussions in Washington added to the pressure for equity futures and in turn wiped out all of Friday’s gains from the Goldilocks jobs report.

Elsewhere, all components in the Hang Seng (-3.5%) were negative and the Shanghai Comp. (-5.2%) slumped heavily due to the renewed tariff threats which reportedly could shed 1.5% of China’s GDP growth, while a PBoC liquidity injection and targeted RRR cut for small and medium-sized banks, as well as mixed Caixin Services and Composite PMI data did little to brighten the sentiment in China.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac indices and US equity futures start the week with heavy losses as US-China trade tensions flare up after President stated that the US will raise the 10% tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese goods to 25% and suggested they will shortly place tariffs on USD 325bln of additional goods from China which are currently untaxed. Furthermore, reports also noted China’s potential cancellation of this week’s trade discussions in Washington which has added to the pressure for equity futures and in turn wiped out all of Friday’s gains from the Goldilocks jobs report. ASX 200 (-1.0%) is negative with the index led lower by underperformance in the tech sector and with the top weighted financials sector also weighed amid losses in ‘Big 4’ bank Westpac after it reported a 24% drop in H1 statutory profit. Elsewhere, all components in the Hang Seng (-3.3%) are negative and Shanghai Comp. (-5.1%) slumped heavily due to the renewed tariff threats, while a PBoC liquidity injection and targeted RRR cut for small and medium-sized banks, as well as mixed Caixin Services and Composite PMI data did little to brighten the sentiment in China.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat around 97.50 following its retreat from the 98.00 level in the aftermath of Friday’s US jobs numbers in which NFPs topped estimates and the Unemployment Rate surprisingly contracted, although the data also showed softer than expected Average Earnings growth. EUR/USD has softened back below the 1.1200 handle and GBP/USD is weaker as senior figures in the opposition Labour party cast doubts on a cross-party deal to break the Brexit deadlock, with reports also noting that Labour MPs will not back the Brexit deal without a 2nd referendum. The risk averse tone from Trump’s tariff offensive spurred safe-haven flows with the downside in USD/JPY and JPY-crosses exacerbated by the absence of participants in Japan, while CNH weakened by 5 points in the fallout of the return of the ‘Tariff Man’. Elsewhere, antipodeans are also pressured with AUD/USD below 0.7000 and NZD/USD eyeing the 0.6600 level to the downside due to their high-beta statuses and China exposure, as well as the upcoming ‘live’ rate decisions from both sides of the Tasman this week.</p>",
