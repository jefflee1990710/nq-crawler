        "content": "<p>A shortened Christmas eve session was categorized by a thin, holiday-like feel, with low volumes.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES:</strong> The bias was towards higher equity prices in the pre-market, though futures took a knock after US President Trump suggested that, although the phase one trade deal between US/China will be ultimately signed off by himself and China President Xi, there would also be a ‘quicker signing’, likely by USTR Lighthizer and China VP Liu; analysts had previously suggested that a Presidential sign-off in the first instance would be a more constructive outcome.</p><p><strong>TREASURIES: </strong>The fixed income complex pared modest losses after a stellar 5-year auction, although analysts were quick to attribute some of the positives on the thinner trading conditions; nevertheless, the complex went positive in wake of the auction, Treasuries went positive, with yields falling by around 2bps, although the shape of the curve was mixed but little changed . The Treasury will sell 7-year debt on Thursday (NOTE: The desk will be closed for this event).</p><p><strong>CRUDE:</strong> Oil benchmarks rose gradually over the course of the session, with WTI topping USD 61.00 per barrel, and Brent above USD 67.00. Analysts said the theme was still ‘trade hopes and supply cuts’. The API will, as usual, release its inventory report at 1630 ET on Tuesday, though the DOE will release its weekly inventory report on Friday (NOTE: the desk will be closed for both events). The Street this week expects headline crude stocks to draw by 1.8mln, distillates are seen building by 0.9mln, and gasoline is seen building by 2.0mln.</p><p><strong>FX:</strong> There was little by way of significant moves in FX, and ranges were thin. Lower equities and Treasuries catching a bid resulted in XAU upside, with the yellow metal rising above USD 1500 for the first time since early November.</p><p><strong>The Newsquawk desk has now shut for the Holidays; normal service will resume on 2nd January.

ASX 200 (+0.1%)</strong> was uneventful in today’s shortened trading session as outperformance in the commodity-related sectors counterbalanced weakness in tech and financials, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (Unch.) </strong>also meandered on the marginal ebbs and flows in the domestic currency with outdated BoJ minutes from the October meeting doing little to spur price action. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%)</strong> conformed to the non-committal tone amid the reduced hours in Hong Kong and with mainland also kept indecisive after the PBoC skipped open market operations, although Chinese Premier Li noted that China will study further steps to lower financing costs including RRR and targeted RRR cuts. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lacklustre following the similar holiday-quietened trade in USTs and with demand sapped by a lack of buying from the BoJ which were only in the market for treasury discount bills, although prices were later supported following the 2yr auction results which were mixed but still attracted a higher b/c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position and announced CNY 6bln in 3-month central bank bill swaps.

(Newswires/Twitter)</p><p><strong>China Global Times tweeted that hopefully US can move faster towards lowering tariffs after China recently announced new tariff-cut plans on imports</strong>, while it separately tweeted comments from China Foreign Minister Wang Yi who stated the US should work with China to get bilateral ties back on track. (Twitter) China Global Times tweeted that China expresses strong dissatisfaction with the US over the negative contents distorting and smearing China's military development and on issues regarding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, as well as prohibited purchase of Chinese products. Furthermore, the Global Times also tweeted that it is impossible for the US to rope in other countries to contain China and that neither Russia nor any other country is willing to become its pawn to contain China.

The Minutes added that some members noted BoJ must not hesitate to take additional easing if there was a greater chance momentum to reaching price target was lost, while members agreed that the economy had been on a moderate expanding trend with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment continued to be affected by the slowdown in overseas economies.

DAX, FTSE MIB and SMI cash markets are among those shut, whilst FTSE 100 (+0.1%), CAC 40 (Unch), AEX (Unch) and IBEX 35 (-0.3%) trade without a clear direction. The latter, however, experiences mild pressure on the back of index-heavy BBVA (-1.1%) - whose shares declined after sources stated that the ECB has asked Spain’s High Court to provide information regarding a probe into spying involving BBVA, to evaluate potential impact on the bank’s governance. Sectors are likewise largely uninspiring, but energy names see some outperformance as most oil-giants remain open – with Royal Dutch Shell (+0.8%) piggybacking on Sterling’s post-election declines and stable energy prices. In terms of other individual movers, PSA (-0.6%) resides towards to bottom of the CAC after the Co. was reiterated with an underperform rating at RBC. Meanwhile, Vivendi (-0.2%) shares are modestly subdued amid the ongoing spat with Mediaset regarding its pan-European merger plans which drew criticism from Vivendi.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>FX markets trade with no conviction ahead of the festive season with DXY just above its 200 DMA around 97.71/7; for reference, its 21 DMA resides at 97.61. Similarly, EUR/USD and GBP/USD move relatively sideways – although the former dipped below its 50 and 21 DMA which both reside around 1.1083 to a low of around 1.1071 before paring some downside, whilst the latter manages to remain afloat above yesterday’s 1.2905 low. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retains its 109.00+ status heading into the Christmas break having largely side-lined the out-of-date BoJ Minutes from its October meeting with the pair reflecting the non-committal risk tone across the holiday-thinned market.

DAX, FTSE MIB and SMI cash markets are among those shut, whilst FTSE 100 (+0.1%), CAC 40 (Unch), AEX (Unch) and IBEX 35 (-0.3%) trade without a clear direction. The latter, however, experiences mild pressure on the back of index-heavy BBVA (-1.1%) - whose shares declined after sources stated that the ECB has asked Spain’s High Court to provide information regarding a probe into spying involving BBVA, to evaluate potential impact on the bank’s governance. Sectors are likewise largely uninspiring, but energy names see some outperformance as most oil-giants remain open – with Royal Dutch Shell (+0.8%) piggybacking on Sterling’s post-election declines and stable energy prices. In terms of other individual movers, PSA (-0.6%) resides towards to bottom of the CAC after the Co. was reiterated with an underperform rating at RBC. Meanwhile, Vivendi (-0.2%) shares are modestly subdued amid the ongoing spat with Mediaset regarding its pan-European merger plans which drew criticism from Vivendi.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>FX markets trade with no conviction ahead of the festive season with <strong>DXY</strong> just above its 200 DMA around 97.71/7; for reference, its 21 DMA resides at 97.61. Similarly, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> move relatively sideways – although the former dipped below its 50 and 21 DMA which both reside around 1.1083 to a low of around 1.1071 before paring some downside, whilst the latter manages to remain afloat above yesterday’s 1.2905 low. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> retains its 109.00+ status heading into the Christmas break having largely side-lined the out-of-date BoJ Minutes from its October meeting with the pair reflecting the non-committal risk tone across the holiday-thinned market. Meanwhile, the <strong>antipodeans</strong> remain choppy within tight 20-pip ranges, albeit the <strong>Kiwi</strong> saw mild impetus heading into the Asia close and currently hovers in proximity to yesterday’s high around 0.6640.

(FT)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>Price action was contained ahead of the holidays in which the <strong>DXY</strong> languished below its 200DMA of 97.71 after the recent weak US Durable Goods Orders, while its transatlantic counterparts fared no better which EUR/USD at a sub-1.1100 level and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> dejected after having extended its slide firmly beneath 1.3000. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses reflected the non-committal risk tone and an uneventful BoJ Minutes from the October meeting, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were also steady amid a lack of risk appetite and pertinent data releases, as well as the relatively stable <strong>CNY</strong> reference rate setting.</p><p>Banxico Governor De Leon said the central bank is not committed to rate moves in any direction and notes inflation is clearly on a downward trend, but risks remain. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were uneventful with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures relatively flat throughout the session amid the holiday-thinned conditions and touted book squaring, with oil prices kept afloat as Wall St extended on its streak of records and as <strong>WTI</strong> found a base at the USD 60.50/bbl level. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> took advantage of the humdrum trade in the greenback to extend on a monthly high and edged closer towards the USD 1500/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> traded predominantly sideways as price moves restricted by the indecisive overnight risk tone but then saw a late marginal breakout from the range heading into the European open.&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>Yields were higher across the curve (by 1-3bps at settlement) in thin, holiday-trading conditions, with the T-Note future remaining within an 11-tick range; the curve was a touch flatter, however, but by under 1bps. The US' sale of 2-year notes was lacklustre, at the very least; the auction stopped on the screws, though cover was the softest in 11 years, signalling very little interest in the last 2s auction of the year. Dealer participation was beneath recent averages, directs was in line with recent averages, while the indirect bid was beneath recent averages. Note: The Treasury will also be selling USD 41bln in 5s on Tuesday, as well as USD 32bln of 7s on Thursday, with this week's auctions set to raise a net USD 31.7bln at the month-end settlement. T-notes (H0) settled 5 ticks lower at 128-03.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mixed with price action range-bound amid the ongoing holiday lull and with several early market closures in the region for Christmas Eve. ASX 200 (+0.1%) was uneventful in today’s shortened trading session as outperformance in the commodity-related sectors counterbalanced weakness in tech and financials, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) also meandered on the marginal ebbs and flows in the domestic currency with outdated BoJ minutes from the October meeting doing little to spur price action. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) conformed to the non-committal tone amid the reduced hours in Hong Kong and with mainland also kept indecisive after the PBoC skipped open market operations, although Chinese Premier Li noted that China will study further steps to lower financing costs including RRR and targeted RRR cuts. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lacklustre following the similar holiday-quietened trade in USTs and with demand sapped by a lack of buying from the BoJ which were only in the market for treasury discount bills, although prices were later supported following the 2yr auction results which were mixed but still attracted a higher b/c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have reflected the non-committal risk tone and an uneventful BoJ Minutes from the October meeting, while antipodeans are also steady amid a lack of risk appetite and relevant data releases, as well as the relatively stable CNY reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful following the similar holiday-quietened trade in USTs and non-committal tone in stocks, while demand is also sapped by a lack of BoJ buying with the central bank only in the market for treasury discount bills.&nbsp;</p>",
