The BoJ also stated at the meeting it will relax terms and conditions for securities lending and will consider introduction of ETF lending facility, while it also noted that it will take longer than intended to achieve 2% target and risks to economic and price outlooks are skewed to the downside.</p><p>Furthermore, the previously released Summary of Opinions from April 24th-25th meeting stated that although it will take time to achieve price stability target, it is necessary to persistently continue current powerful monetary easing as the momentum toward 2% target is maintained, while the BoJ also had the opinion that while downside risks to overseas economies continue to warrant attention, the view that a pick-up is expected in the second half of this year is appropriate at this point.</p><p>Today’s release is not expected to impact markets as the reaction to the actual meeting was muted, and as the BoJ held a more recent meeting last week in which it continued to maintain its policy settings and guidance.</p>",

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was under pressure after news that the drug maker would divest its Otezla stake to clinch approval for its proposed merger with Celgene (CELG – which also moved lower). FedEx (FDX) shares moved lower after, less than a month after apologising for the misdirection of packages between Huawei offices, FedEx had to apologise for another mistake, on which it blamed an \"operational error\" due to compliance with US restrictions on business with Huawei Technologies. Carmax (KMX) moved lower after a downgraded to neutral from buy at Buckingham. Beauty names, including Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sunk on the news that Amazon is launching an Amazon Professional Beauty Store. Electronic Arts (EA) firmed after being added to the “best idea list” at Stephens. Micron Technologies (MU) moved higher, despite receiving a price target cut at Mizuho, and ahead of earnings this week. Deere &amp; Co (DE) shares were buoyant after the co. was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies. Disney (DIS) was lower after Pixar’s Toy Story 4 film missed revenue expectations in its first weekend. United Technologies (UTX) moved higher after an upgrade at Cowen, which cites the recent 5% sell-off as an opportunity. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) touched fresh record highs after Wedbush rated the co. \"buy\", citing sustained comp-sales growth. Gold names, including Barrick Gold (GOLD), were lifted as gold prices moved toward six-year highs. US banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and State Street (STT) performed well after they cleared the first hurdle of the Fed's stress test.

Participants are likely to be cautious on the loading up of risk ahead of the G-20 summit and the geopolitical noise in the background. Analysts note the rally was assisted by thin volume, in addition to a chunky 28k+ TYU9 block purchase by a hedge fund as the European session came to a close, which was accompanied by a 4k+ block sale of ultra longs seeing the curve steepen. At settlement, the belly of the curve saw the most action (5-year yield down by c. 5.5bps); spreads were mixed, with the 2s/5s flattening by over 1bps, whilst the 5s/10s steepened by c. 0.5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 13+ ticks higher at 127-30.</p>",

Iran’s UN Ambassador said later in response that Iran will not accept dialogue with the US while it is under the threat of sanctions and that the sanctions were disrespectful of international law and order. With the key shipping channel, the Strait of Hormuz, at risk from rising conflict, the US announced that it was building a coalition with its allies in order to preserve navigational freedom within the Gulf, named the 'Sentinel Programme', which will aid the US &amp; Allies in having eyes on all shipping. The US State Department later confirmed the US would be sending some of its own ships to participate in the programme. President Trump has frequently made clear his aversion to conflict, he reiterated this in some tweets on Monday where he asked why the US protects the Strait of Hormuz for \"zero compensation\", stating that other countries should protect themselves; he also asked why the US needs to be there when they are \"the largest producer of energy\". This interjection by Trump appears to be a tactic in trying to reduce Iran's leverage by promoting the importance of US shale production in meeting US demands for crude. With the new sanctions on Iran, it is beginning to appear the US is now going head-to-head with Russia too, given that the Russian Deputy foreign Minister said that the Kremlin and its allies will counteract sanctions placed on Iran. Although the US is not alone in its efforts against the Iranian regime, given Iran’s regional opponents (e.g. Saudi/Israel/UAE), and certain European nations could well be preparing a move following reports that France, UK, and Germany submitted a diplomatic demarche to Iran on June 22nd, warning of consequences if it does not keep to its nuclear commitments; previous sources had suggested that Iran is already exceeding its enriched uranium caps, so if maintained, could result in a clampdown on both sides of the pond.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>In what seemed to be a mild push back against the market, which is more than 100% priced for July rate cut, as well as against other Fed members who have already expressed the desire for rate cuts, Fed’s Kaplan said it would be wise to take time to consider if there is a need to change rates and that he is concerned that adding monetary stimulus will contribute to the build up of excesses and imbalances. He added that it is too early to judge whether trade &amp; global growth uncertainties will hurt the US and that monthly job gains of 60,000 to 120,000 would mean 'strong' jobs market. However, he did concede that downside risks to the US economy have increase. He also noted that current interest rates are 'in the neighbourhood' of neutral.</p><p><strong>* G20: </strong>Optimism remains ahead of this week’s G20 meeting (and the highly anticipated “extended” meeting between US President Trump and China President Xi. Although constructive noises have been made from both sides, the chances of a deal this week are slim, and talks are being framed as a step to get trade negotiations back on track. However, some desks are becoming more vocal, warning that a lack of truce at the meetings endangers the risk rally induced by the dovish pivots of the Fed and ECB. Additionally, SocGen’s analysts warn that the G20 meeting coincides with month-, quarter-, and half-year-end, when portfolio flows could generate unforeseen swings in FX and fixed income.</p><p><strong>* CHINESE PRESS’ COMMENTARY: </strong>Chinese negotiators will be able to take a tougher line with the US, due to China’s economic resilience, though researchers warned not to go too far in retaliatory measures, since the objective was to bring the US back to the negotiating table, SCMP reported, citing researchers at a Chinese think tank. People’s Daily editorial stated that China has the strength and patience to withstand a trade war, and it could fight to the end if the US persists; the article called on US to show good faith, and take into account US concerns, saying that only equal dialogue can lead to a win/win situation.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Governor Lowe overnight said the impact of rate cuts on the exchange rate channel is the most important element of the central bank’s monetary policy transmission channel; however, he argued that if all central banks are easing, there is no FX rate channel, and accordingly, we should not expect a boost to growth from lower rates. Lowe called for support from fiscal policy and structural reforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ISTANBUL ELECTIONS: </strong>The re-run of the Istanbul elections saw opposition CHP party’s Imamoglu beat President Erdogan’s AKP candidate Yildrim (again) by a margin of 54% vs 45% (this extended the vote gap to 800k vs 14k at the original vote); crucially, Yildrim conceded. “This is the best possible outcome from a market perspective,” TD Securities said, “however, the AKP and Erdogan still have a few aces up their sleeves and we warn against excessive enthusiasm,” noting that ‘judicial revenge’ could potentially be on the cards for Imamoglu, who has been accused of supporting Gulen, a scholar who has been accused of masterminding a coup attempt in 2016.</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> The EU will hold-off opening a new EDP measure against Italy over high debt levels, the FT reported. The bund/BTP spread narrowed to around 240bps, accordingly, before reversing these relative gains somewhat.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY IFO: </strong>In line with expectations but continues to paint a challenging picture. The fall offsets the rebound seen recently, and the expectations sit at a four-month low, and mitigates some of the optimism around the rise in the current assessment. Manufacturing sentiment fell further. However, wholesale trade sentiment put in an encouraging rise.</p><p><strong>* RBI: </strong>Deputy Governor Acharya reportedly quit six months early, Business Standard reported, citing “unavoidable personal reasons.” The departure is not a surprise, since Acharya has clashed with the government on issues of central bank independence in the past. “At the margin, the composition of the MPC will likely become incrementally more dovish, in our view, as Dr Acharya stood on the more hawkish side of the policy spectrum,” Nomura said, “For now, the focus shifts to Dr Acharya’s successor, the submission of Dr Bimal Jalan committee report on the RBI’s economic capital framework and the union budget on 5th July.”</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.47 HIGHER AT USD 57.90/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (Q9) SETTLE USD 0.34 LOWER AT USD 64.86/BBL:</strong> Crude markets got off on the front foot to start the week, before eventually drifting lower into settlement on Monday. Geopolitics was undoubtedly providing support to the crude complex, with the US launching new sanctions against top Iranian officials. Later in the session the US announced it was constructing a coalition with its allies in order to preserve navigational freedom within the Gulf, naming it the 'Sentinel Programme', which will aid the US &amp; Allies in having eyes on all shipping; this eased some supply-risk related concerns, providing headwinds to oil prices, on top of some Trump tweets expressing concern about the US’ presence in the region. Demand concerns still lurk in the backdrop, especially over the prospect of no trade resolution emerging from the G20, but UBS feels this may be overdone. “While this would clearly have negative implications for oil demand, the pull-back from above USD 70 per barrel a month ago largely prices in growing caution on global growth, but not the growing risk to medium-term supply that results from the increasingly hard-line US stance on Iran.” Although the G20 outcome is also arguably tied to the supply picture, where Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has put off further public comment until after the summit, analysts at Citi note: “This at least implies that action at the G20 – perhaps including any progress in US-China trade talks – could be the deciding factor in Russia’s willingness to continue limiting output. Or, perhaps it was simply a dodge.” Elsewhere in supply news flow, trade sources noted that Nigeria’s Qua Iboe crude stream is to export 9 cargoes in August, up from 6 originally planned in July. RBC’s thinks that crude buyers will seek other sources of crude, particular in the Atlantic Basin region (which Nigeria falls under), as supply out of the Strait of Hormuz is put at risk. Looking ahead to Tuesday’s API data, and Wednesday’s DOE data, the street expects to see crude stocks drawing by 2.9mln bbls this week, distillates are likely to build by 0.5mln bbls, and gasoline is seen building 0.2mln bbls; Genscape reportedly forecast a draw in Cushing stocks this week of 165k bbls.</p><p><strong>* WEEK’S SUPPLY:</strong> This week, the US Treasury will auction USD 131bln of 2-year (USD 40bln, Tuesday), 5-year (USD 41boln, Wednesday), 7-year (USD 32bln, Thursday), as well as a 2-year FRN (USD 18bln, Wednesday). USD 72bln matures at the month-end settlement, implying USD 59bln of net cash will be raised, TD Securities says.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: US to sell USD 40bln 2-year notes at 1800 BST/1300 EDT: </strong>From a relative value perspective, the current 2-year note is lacking set up ahead of Tuesday’s auction, and trades rich on asset swap versus older 2s. “The auction is expected to benefit from dovish June FOMC meeting,” SocGen says, “similarly, our view for a modest steepening of the 2s10s curve led by the front-end should also support demand for the auction.” However, SocGen warns that dealer holdings in the 2-3-year sector has risen to a record high, which might limit demand from dealers, and will need support from investment funds and foreign participants in order to perform well. Last month’s auction was well received against the backdrop of global trade wars, and the demand from the foreign and investment bid was solid. SocGen is positive on the 2s auction.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 13+ TICKS HIGHER AT 127-30: </strong>The T-Plex traded range bound earlier on before gaining traction going into the US session, seeing it comfortably in the green for settlement. Participants are likely to be cautious on the loading up of risk ahead of the G-20 summit and the geopolitical noise in the background. Analysts note the rally was assisted by thin volume, in addition to a chunky 28k+ TYU9 block purchase by a hedge fund as the European session came to a close, which was accompanied by a 4k+ block sale of ultra longs seeing the curve steepen. At settlement, the belly of the curve saw the most action (5-year yield down by c. 5.5bps); spreads were mixed, with the 2s/5s flattening by over 1bps, whilst the 5s/10s steepened by c. 0.5bps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 2945, NASDAQ-100 -0.1% at 7723, Dow Jones 0% at 26729, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary -0.5%, Consumer Staples 0.3%, Energy -0.9%, Financials -0.3%, Health Care -0.5%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology 0.2%, Materials 0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) saw its PT cut at Moffett Nathanson, which said that search revenue growth is likely to slow. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was under pressure after news that the drug maker would divest its Otezla stake to clinch approval for its proposed merger with Celgene (CELG – which also moved lower). FedEx (FDX) shares moved lower after, less than a month after apologising for the misdirection of packages between Huawei offices, FedEx had to apologise for another mistake, on which it blamed an \"operational error\" due to compliance with US restrictions on business with Huawei Technologies. Carmax (KMX) moved lower after a downgraded to neutral from buy at Buckingham. Beauty names, including Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sunk on the news that Amazon is launching an Amazon Professional Beauty Store. Electronic Arts (EA) firmed after being added to the “best idea list” at Stephens. Micron Technologies (MU) moved higher, despite receiving a price target cut at Mizuho, and ahead of earnings this week. Deere &amp; Co (DE) shares were buoyant after the co. was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies. Disney (DIS) was lower after Pixar’s Toy Story 4 film missed revenue expectations in its first weekend. United Technologies (UTX) moved higher after an upgrade at Cowen, which cites the recent 5% sell-off as an opportunity. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) touched fresh record highs after Wedbush rated the co. \"buy\", citing sustained comp-sales growth. Gold names, including Barrick Gold (GOLD), were lifted as gold prices moved toward six-year highs. US banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and State Street (STT) performed well after they cleared the first hurdle of the Fed's stress test. Axalta (AXTA) was buoyant after on reports that Jana Partners had built a position in the co.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The risk on currencies (<strong>AUD</strong>, <strong>TRY</strong> and <strong>KRW</strong>) are performing well, the cyclical currencies (<strong>EUR</strong>, <strong>SEK</strong>) are up, and havens are mixed; the <strong>JPY</strong> has resumed settling into a thin range, after the slide post FOMC last Wednesday, the <strong>CHF</strong> is actually firmer, as is <strong>XAU</strong>, though <strong>DXY</strong> trades slightly negative; desks have noted that month-end factors may be playing a role (favours <strong>USD</strong> selling). Additionally, it may be that traders are focussing on the end of week risk events (G20, month/quarter/H1 end). A abysmal Dallas Fed headline led to some negative ticks for the buck, though the forward looking components were more encouraging (like the Empire and Philly Fed manufacturing surveys); the buck did little to suggest it was going to test its 200dma, which it slipped beneath last week, and is consolidating above 96.00. This weakness has allowed <strong>EUR</strong> to see upside, though 1.14 seems a touch level to negotiate. There was further upside for <strong>gold</strong>, and from a technical perspective, it will be interesting to see if it can close above the USD 1400 mark on a monthly candle, which would be a bullish sign, technicians argue. Antipodeans were firmer against the Buck, with the Aussie marginally eclipsing its neighbour in wake of comments from RBA’s Lowe overnight, who suggested that rate cuts become less effective if other global Central Banks are also in easing mode. AUDUSD is hovering near recent/today’s highs at 0.6960, while NZDUSD and the AUDNZD cross sit just above 0.6600 and 1.0500 respectively ahead of Wednesday’s RBNZ.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>After breaching its 200dma last week, the DXY continues to slide. Technicians note that the breach has occurred three times thus far in 2019, with each proving to be a buying opportunity. The question is whether the Fed looseness, risk-off (either due to threats to global growth, or even geopolitical escalation with Iran) dominates the narrative. A positive outcome at the G20 would make any rebound above the 200dma more challenging, analysts suggest. It is also worth noting that Barclays’ month-end FX rebalancing model favours strong USD selling.</p><p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>SocGen has warned that a lack of truce at the meetings endangers the risk rally induced by the dovish pivots of the Fed and ECB, and while JPY and CHF’s correlations to stocks and the CNY/CNH spread have lessened, the bank states that we could soon be close to levels where intervention by all three of the BOJ, SNB and PBOC becomes a risk; fallout from the G20 may provide the catalyst.</p><p><strong>* TRY: </strong>Initially rallied after CHP edge out Erdogan’s AKP in the Istanbul election re-run, though desks have warned against excessive optimism and USDTRY has since erased the weekend’s losses.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>Was firmer amid optimism ahead of the potential Brazilian pension reform vote with O Globo suggesting that the bill has the support of around 318 parliamentarians (308 required). In terms of timing for the vote, UBS notes there is still optimism for a vote on June 26th despite comments from President Bolsonaro that the vote could be delayed by a week. UBS also highlight that a deal could be brokered by the Lower House speaker Maia that would see the vote take place before the July 17th recess.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude markets got off on the front foot to start the week, before eventually drifting lower into settlement on Monday. Geopolitics was undoubtedly providing support to the crude complex, with the US launching new sanctions against top Iranian officials. Later in the session the US announced it was constructing a coalition with its allies in order to preserve navigational freedom within the Gulf, naming it the 'Sentinel Programme', which will aid the US &amp; Allies in having eyes on all shipping; this eased some supply-risk related concerns, providing headwinds to oil prices, on top of some Trump tweets expressing concern about the US’ presence in the region. Demand concerns still lurk in the backdrop, especially over the prospect of no trade resolution emerging from the G20, but UBS feels this may be overdone. “While this would clearly have negative implications for oil demand, the pull-back from above USD 70 per barrel a month ago largely prices in growing caution on global growth, but not the growing risk to medium-term supply that results from the increasingly hard-line US stance on Iran.” Although the G20 outcome is also arguably tied to the supply picture, where Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has put off further public comment until after the summit, analysts at Citi note: “This at least implies that action at the G20 – perhaps including any progress in US-China trade talks – could be the deciding factor in Russia’s willingness to continue limiting output. Or, perhaps it was simply a dodge.” Elsewhere in supply news flow, trade sources noted that Nigeria’s Qua Iboe crude stream is to export 9 cargoes in August, up from 6 originally planned in July. RBC’s thinks that crude buyers will seek other sources of crude, particular in the Atlantic Basin region (which Nigeria falls under), as supply out of the Strait of Hormuz is put at risk. Looking ahead to Tuesday’s API data, and Wednesday’s DOE data, the street expects to see crude stocks drawing by 2.9mln bbls this week, distillates are likely to build by 0.5mln bbls, and gasoline is seen building 0.2mln bbls; Genscape reportedly forecast a draw in Cushing stocks this week of 165k bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and broad Dollar have regained some composure despite the FOMC’s dovish twist and ongoing US-China/global trade and geopolitical jitters ahead of the G20. Moreover, month, quarter and half year end factors are also unsupportive as Barclays early indications point to strong selling for portfolio rebalancing. However, the DXY appears to have survived a sub-96.000 test with the help of technical support just below the big figure in the form of the 200 WMA (95.964) and as several rival currencies weaken more than Greenback or pare best gains.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/NOK</strong></p><p>The major underperformers, as the Yen crossed the NY cut bang on 1.3 bn option expiries at 107.50, albeit just and with minimal follow-through buying after holding around Fib support earlier (107.27), while Cable retreated from technical resistance to probe a similar downside chart level ahead of 1.2700 within a 1.2766-09 range (Fibs at 1.2766 and 1.2705) and the Pound also lost ground vs the Euro from circa 0.8920 to 0.8950+. Elsewhere, a retreat in oil prices weighed on the Norwegian Krona as Eur/Nok climbed from around 9.6500 to 9.6860 at one stage, in contrast to Eur/Sek that eased from just shy of 10.6400 to a fraction off 10.5925. Note, the Swedish Crown may have gleaned some traction from an MS trade of the week eyeing 10.2500 in the cross, although a Usd/Mxn short from the same bank targeting 18.2500 has moved in the opposite direction thus far.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CHF/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All firmer against the Buck, as the Aussie also marginally eclipses its Antipodean peer in wake of comments from RBA’s Lowe overnight noting that rate cuts become less effective if other global Central Banks are also in easing mode. Aud/Usd is hovering near the upper end of 0.6929-61 trading parameters, while Nzd/Usd and the Aud/Nzd cross sit just above 0.6600 and 1.0500 respectively ahead of Wednesday’s RBNZ – for a detailed preview of the policy meeting see the Research Suite, but in short benchmark rates are forecast to remain unchanged before another ease in August. Elsewhere, the Franc has now breached resistance at 0.9750 and 1.1100 against the Euro that got closer to 1.1400 vs the Dollar, but held agonisingly below and is now revisiting the 50 DMA at 1.1390 which could be pivotal on a closing basis. The Loonie was also undermined by the aforementioned downturn in crude and retreated from circa 1.3178 to 1.3220 before paring back and awaiting the BoC’s regional survey for some independent impetus.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Try has been volatile after early euphoria following the weekend Istanbul rerun and an overwhelming victory for the opposition was compounded by a relatively upbeat Turkish manufacturing survey, as broader weakness in the region vs the Usd permeated. However, the Lira remains firm within a circa 5.8300-7085 band unlike the Rand that is still reviewing last week’s SA SONA and mulling how President Ramaphosa aims to fund fresh aid pledged to Eskom and whether this will fall short of the cash needed to sort the company’s financial issues again. Usd/Zar is currently around 14.3575 within a 14.2365-40000 range vs Usd/Brl contained between 3.8075-8375 amidst more positive developments on the Brazil pension reform bill (various local press reports suggest enough votes to pass and maybe before mid-July).</p>",

The 96.000 handle looks under threat and could be relinquished amidst strength elsewhere, with Gold edging back over Usd 1400/oz and Eur/Usd eyeing 1.1400.

The Kiwi is pivoting 0.6600 and Aussie 0.6950 ahead of this week’s RBNZ meeting on Wednesday with rates widely tipped to remain unchanged before another cut in August, while comments from RBA’s Lowe may have dampened some dovish expectations as he questioned the effectiveness of easing to support the economy in the context of moves by other Central Banks aimed at sustaining growth and reaching inflation targets.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR - </strong>The next best G10 currencies, as the Loonie consolidates recovery gains through 1.3200 after its post-Canadian retail sales wobble, with some support from firmer crude prices, and the Euro draws encouragement from the latest German Ifo survey that was not as weak as forecast overall. Moreover, the institute maintained its 2019 GDP estimate and played down the prospect of a recession even though the economy is in the doldrums, or heading that way. However, Eur/Usd has tested the 50 DMA (1.1390) after clearing 200 DMA and WMAs, but falling just short barriers at the next big figure where the top end of 2 bn option expiries lie (from 1.1390 coincidentally).</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/JPY - </strong>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck as the Franc stalls ahead of 0.9750 and Pound meets resistance above 1.2750 in the form of a 38.2% retracement of the fall from 1.3185 to 1.2506 at 1.2766. Meanwhile, the Yen has retreated a bit further from 107.00 and into a 107.29-48 band with technical support seen a fraction under (107.27 Fib) and decent expiry interest a whisker above (1.3 bn at the 107.50 strike).</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Lira has rebounded further from recent lows and in large part on the back of a resounding result at the 2nd Istanbul election that will not be contested this time.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback has fallen further following last week’s dovish Fed policy meeting and Friday’s relatively weak PMIs, with the <strong>DXY</strong> faltering after a fleeting attempt to pare losses and probe above 96.200. The 96.000 handle looks under threat and could be relinquished amidst strength elsewhere, with Gold edging back over Usd 1400/oz and Eur/Usd eyeing 1.1400. Note also, the pressure could build as the week unfolds with at least one currency rebalancing model flagging a strong sell signal for the end of June, Q2 and H1, not to mention the G20 where US President Trump is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi for extensive trade talks.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Perhaps surprisingly given ongoing global trade and geopolitical uncertainty, the Antipodean Dollars are outperforming major peers, or rather deriving most momentum from their US rival’s demise. The Kiwi is pivoting 0.6600 and Aussie 0.6950 ahead of this week’s RBNZ meeting on Wednesday with rates widely tipped to remain unchanged before another cut in August, while comments from RBA’s Lowe may have dampened some dovish expectations as he questioned the effectiveness of easing to support the economy in the context of moves by other Central Banks aimed at sustaining growth and reaching inflation targets.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>The next best G10 currencies, as the Loonie consolidates recovery gains through 1.3200 after its post-Canadian retail sales wobble, with some support from firmer crude prices, and the Euro draws encouragement from the latest German Ifo survey that was not as weak as forecast overall. Moreover, the institute maintained its 2019 GDP estimate and played down the prospect of a recession even though the economy is in the doldrums, or heading that way. However, Eur/Usd has tested the 50 DMA (1.1390) after clearing 200 DMA and WMAs, but falling just short barriers at the next big figure where the top end of 2 bn option expiries lie (from 1.1390 coincidentally).</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck as the Franc stalls ahead of 0.9750 and Pound meets resistance above 1.2750 in the form of a 38.2% retracement of the fall from 1.3185 to 1.2506 at 1.2766. Meanwhile, the Yen has retreated a bit further from 107.00 and into a 107.29-48 band with technical support seen a fraction under (107.27 Fib) and decent expiry interest a whisker above (1.3 bn at the 107.50 strike).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira has rebounded further from recent lows and in large part on the back of a resounding result at the 2nd Istanbul election that will not be contested this time. Indeed, President Erdogan congratulated the victor after the landslide saw Imamoglu defeat ex-PM Yildirim by whopping 800k votes. Usd/Try is hovering towards the bottom of a 5.7085-8200, with additional support for the Lira from an improvement in Turkish manufacturing sentiment.</p>",
