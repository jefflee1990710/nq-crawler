FedEx (FDX) outperformed after constructive comments from Credit Suisse; however Berenberg downgraded FedEx, but upgraded competitor UPS (UPS) which also surged. Strong Chinese and US manufacturing data spiked risk appetite causing high beta stocks such as the chipmakers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) to all trade higher, in addition to US listed Chinese stocks such as JD.com (JD) and Baidu (BIDU), and trade sensitive stocks such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA). United Technologies (UTX) traded near the top of the DJIA thanks to PT rise at Jefferies. Morgan Stanley initiated big oil coverage, where it preferred Chevron (CVX) over Exxon Mobil (XOM). Wedbush added Activision Blizzard (ATVI) to its Best Ideas list, seeing the stock surge on the open. Celgene (CELG) lagged behind competitors after UBS downgraded the Bristol-Myers (BMY) target to Neutral from Buy, citing the stocks recent strong performance as the merger deal becomes more likely, following independent merger review approval and investor Starboard Value withdrawing its opposition to the deal. Lyft (LYFT) saw double digit losses following its IPO, a Neutral initiation at Guggenheim didn’t help, and threw some cold water on hopes of an IPO mania revival, with heavyweights Uber, WeWork and Airbnb all likely to be more cautious about coming to market. SPX +1.16% at 1867, NDX +1.35% at 7478, DJI +1.27% at 26258.</p><p>Risk-on was the theme after China PMI data reassured that the country has seen a stabilisation in the manufacturing sector, and combined with a chipper ISM manufacturing report out of the US, the stage was set for yields to rise. In fact, it appears yields are set for the biggest-single day rise in around three-months (2s yields +5.3bps at settle, 5s yields +6.9bps, 10s yields +8.2bps, 30s yields +7bps). Major curves bear-steepened modestly (1.2bps to 2.6bps), though 10s30s saw some small narrowing. The much-watched 3m/10yr spread moved back into positive territory with reassuring global growth signs (ex-EZ PMIs); while this spread is only a symptom of a much larger cause, analysts seem to be more generally buying-into the argument presented by some Fed officials of late, which suggested that structural factors have diminished the recession signal, though the growth concerns remain valid. US T-note futures (M9) settled 19+ ticks lower at 123-19+.</p>",

Breaking down the index, the employment index was the biggest tailwind for the headline figure, printing a multi-year record increase of 5.2 points to 57.5 (NFP on Friday), following the disappointing February figure. Elsewhere, the new orders index and production index showed healthy increases by 1.9 points and 1 point respectively, bringing the new orders index “right in line with the Q4 average, highlighting that demand remains quite strong,” the consultancy highlights. However, “stronger new orders and production were mostly offset by slower supplier deliveries and less inventory-building,” where the supplier deliveries index printed 54.2, the lowest reading since January 2017, and the inventories index falling from 53.4 to 51.8. After decreasing in the prior two months, the input prices figure showed some stabilisation with a rise to 54.3, “Overall, inflation remains benign and with the Fed’s dovish paradigm shift, we foresee no further rate hikes as the FOMC has likely reached the terminal rate for this cycle.”</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES: </strong>February retail sales showed a surprise contraction, where the M/M change printed -0.2%, missing the expected 0.3% rise and paring back January’s 0.2% rise, dampening some of Monday’s strong risk appetite, although January was revised higher to +0.7%. Capital Economics’ analysts comment, “The decline in the headline figure came despite a 0.7% M/M rise in spending on motor vehicles, although that in itself is a little hard to square with the recent weakness of the manufacturers’ unit sales figures.” Elsewhere beneath the headline, gas station sales rose by 1%, but dragging the index was the 4.4% fall in building material sales, “although that simply reversed an identical rise in January.” Capital Economics highlights that excluding the volatile components, which were likely to be impacted by weather shocks, the control group fell by 0.2%, well beneath the expected 0.4% rise. “Even allowing for a decent rebound in underlying sales in March, we estimate that real consumption growth slowed to no more than 1.0% in Q1, from 2.5% in Q4.” The consultancy concludes by forecasting that this weaker consumption will reinforce the Fed’s patient stance, and they, “expect the Fed’s next move will be to cut interest rates.”</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE CPI: </strong>Eurozone inflation slipped in March to 1.4% (prev. 1.5%); the core measure declined by more than expected at 0.8% (cons 0.9% vs prev 1.0%). While much of this drop in the core will reverse next month, the underlying picture continues to show modest price growth, ING said, noting that the timing of Easter will continue to distort inflation through the spring months. \"Not too much to get excited about, but the overall picture of bleak core inflation remains,\" ING writes, \"next month will likely see some overshooting of 1% due to the Easter effect reversing, but the underlying story remains one of subdued core inflation as businesses continue to take higher wage growth in their margins because of global uncertainty.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB: ECB's Draghi (Dovish)</strong> said on Monday that substantial monetary policy stimulus remains essential, in light of uncertainties regarding geopolitical factors. <strong>ECB's De Guindos (Neutral)</strong> said that negative rates are quite important for economic activity, adding that the low profitability of banks goes beyond potential impact of low rates. De Guindos also said he was analysing whether banks need compensation for negative rates, although it had not been discussed by policy makers.</p><p><strong>* BOC POLOZ: </strong>BOC Gov Poloz says outlook still warrants an interest rate below the neutral range; data consistent with expectation that below-potential growth will be transitory.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: RBA RATE ANNOUNCEMENT DUE TUESDAY 2ND APRIL AT 0430BST/2230CDT/1130HKT. </strong>The implied yield curve suggests the next move in rates will be lower with a 25bps cut in July and again in December this year<strong>.</strong> <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21503/download\">Click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Indicative votes on Brexit options will begin at 2000 BST, with results expected to be announced around 2200 BST. The Speaker has selected the following motions to be voted on: (C) CUSTOMS UNION (Table by Ken Clarke [Con] and Hilary Benn [Lab]) – Withdrawal Agreement has to have a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union, i.e. a “soft Brexit” (this option garnered the most support of previous indicative votes, with lawmakers voting 272 nay vs 264 aye); (D) COMMONS MARKET 2.0 (Tabled by Nick Boles [Con] and Lucy Powell [Lab]) – UK would re-join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA), meaning the UK will remain the in single market (this was widely rejected on 27th March, 283 against vs 180 for). (E) CONFIRMATORY PUBLIC VOTE (Tabled by Peter Kyle [Lab]) – Any deal cannot be ratified in parliament without public consent, i.e. people’s vote (motion previously received 268 for and 295 against). (G) PARLIAMENTARY SUPREMACY (Tabled by Joanna Cherry [SNP]) – UK would seek a further extension if a deal is not agreed by 10th April. If the EU does not accept an extension, MPs would be asked to vote between a no-deal Brexit or revoking Article 50. If MPs vote in favour of the revocation, the future relationship between the UK and the EU will be discussed (MPs have not voted on this motion before). The latest seems to suggest that opposition Labour have whipped their lawmakers to vote for motion D; the Tories' Cabinet minister will once again abstain, while the rest of the Conservative MPs will be allowed a free vote.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 1.45 HIGHER AT USD 61.59/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLED USD 1.43 HIGHER AT USD 69.01/BBL. </strong>Oil prices began the week on the front foot, finding support from strong manufacturing PMI data out of China and manufacturing ISM in the US, as well as further output cuts becoming evident from OPEC+. However, the Eurozone gauge came in weaker, and below the 50 level. March OPEC surveys have begun hitting; Reuters’ poll sees oil output falling 280k BPD M/M, to 30.4mln BPD (the lowest since 2015); members subject to the supply-cut deal are seen to achieve 135% compliance, compared to 101% in the prior month, with Saudi and Venezuela posting the largest production declines, which isn’t too surprising given that Saudi is spearheading the cuts and Venezuela’s inability to produce gives it little choice. Elsewhere, the Iranian Oil Minister said it should be easy to extend the OPEC+ supply cut deal; the Russian Central Bank says it does not rule out an extension of OPEC+ output agreements into H2 2019; Iraqi crude oil exports reached 3.377mln BPD in March vs. 3.62mln in February, with oil exports from southern ports at 3.254mln bpd, according to the Oil Ministry, which contradicts the 3.45mln figure given last week by Iraqi officials.</p><p><strong>* SPX +1.16% at 1867, NDX +1.35% at 7478, DJI +1.27% at 26258. SECTORS: Energy +1.37%, Materials +1.50%, Industrials +2.07%, Cons Discretionary +1.17%, Cons Staples -0.21%, Healthcare +0.17%, Financials +2.42%, Tech +1.40%, Telecoms +1.45%, Utilities -0.71%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Casino stocks Wynn (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Resorts (MLCO) surged on Monday, with the move being attributed to Macau casino revenue printing the highest figure this year, coming in at the top end of estimates, despite being a 0.4% decrease form March 2018. FedEx (FDX) outperformed after constructive comments from Credit Suisse; however Berenberg downgraded FedEx, but upgraded competitor UPS (UPS) which also surged. Strong Chinese and US manufacturing data spiked risk appetite causing high beta stocks such as the chipmakers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) to all trade higher, in addition to US listed Chinese stocks such as JD.com (JD) and Baidu (BIDU), and trade sensitive stocks such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA). United Technologies (UTX) traded near the top of the DJIA thanks to PT rise at Jefferies. Morgan Stanley initiated big oil coverage, where it preferred Chevron (CVX) over Exxon Mobil (XOM). Wedbush added Activision Blizzard (ATVI) to its Best Ideas list, seeing the stock surge on the open. Celgene (CELG) lagged behind competitors after UBS downgraded the Bristol-Myers (BMY) target to Neutral from Buy, citing the stocks recent strong performance as the merger deal becomes more likely, following independent merger review approval and investor Starboard Value withdrawing its opposition to the deal. Lyft (LYFT) saw double digit losses following its IPO, a Neutral initiation at Guggenheim didn’t help, and threw some cold water on hopes of an IPO mania revival, with heavyweights Uber, WeWork and Airbnb all likely to be more cautious about coming to market.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 19+ TICKS LOWER AT 123-19+. </strong>Risk-on was the theme after China PMI data reassured that the country has seen a stabilisation in the manufacturing sector, and combined with a chipper ISM manufacturing report out of the US, the stage was set for yields to rise. In fact, it appears yields are set for the biggest-single day rise in around three-months (2s yields +5.3bps at settle, 5s yields +6.9bps, 10s yields +8.2bps, 30s yields +7bps). Major curves bear-steepened modestly (1.2bps to 2.6bps), though 10s30s saw some small narrowing. The much-watched 3m/10yr spread moved back into positive territory with reassuring global growth signs (ex-EZ PMIs); while this spread is only a symptom of a much larger cause, analysts seem to be more generally buying-into the argument presented by some Fed officials of late, which suggested that structural factors have diminished the recession signal, though the growth concerns remain valid.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> A risk-on environment saw USD sellers overnight, after China's official manufacturing PMI surprised to the upside in March, following stabilisation seen in February. The mood was firm enough to ignore the dreadful EZ PMIs. There was a kneejerk lower after US retail sales fell short in Feb, though the Jan data was all revised up; the USD pared back losses in wake of a solid ISM report, which helped dispel some concerns about the growth slowdown (in conjunction with the China data). It helped the activity currencies (AUD, NZD, CAD). The JPY was weaker, underpinned by a weak Tankan report overnight, while the US 3m/10yr curve exited inversion. The TRY managed to recoup sharp losses after Turkey's local elections, while the ZAR caught a bid after Moody's delayed its review on the South Africa's ratings. Elsewhere in EMFX, the MXN held up well despite Trump's recent threats to close the border between Mexico and the US.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling also trades stronger, supported by decent manufacturing PMI; however, many have suggested that the bounce is a function of stockpiling and completing workloads ahead of Brexit, with some analysts suggesting that we are unlikely to see the strength sustained in the months ahead, absence any movement on Brexit. Nevertheless, Capital Economics' analysts see upside for the GBP in the month's ahead. Currently, GBP is being split by numerous soft and hard Brexit options, and as these are removed, the path to a softer Brexit could help support the pound, the argument goes. However, amid all the optimism, it is worth reiterating that if Parliament cannot give EU policymakers a convincing game plan for why the Article 50 process should be extended, the default position remains that the UK will leave on 12 April, without a deal; it is worth adding that many are expecting movement before this happens, but we would not that Brexit optimism doesn't have a great track record of showing follow-through.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Moody's delayed its rating review of South Africa on Friday (the consensus was looking for an unchanged Baa3/stable, though some had expected an outlook revision, or an outright downgrade). ZAR traders have reacted positively, seeing USDZAR fall by over 2%. However, this seems like just a delay; RBC argues that the CRA may be waiting for greater clarity that will be seen after May's elections, however, it buys the nation more time to implement changes to maintain its final investment grade rating.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> Turkish local elections have seen President Erdogan's AKP party lost control of capital Ankara, as well as other key large cities (though they are set to contest the outcome). The Lira was weaker against the USD, with analysts suggesting that since there is no General Election until 2023, the focus is on policy direction, and it raises uncertainty around the prospects of structural reforms. However, through the course of the session, the TRY pared losses as offshore swap rates rose again, making it more expensive to short the TRY. ABN AMRO's analysts&nbsp; say that in light of last week's FX interventions, and the election losses, \"Turkey is highly vulnerable to a shift in investor sentiment, and depends on foreign investors to fund its current account deficit, the long-term negative implications from the measures taken last week outweigh any short-term gains,\" and \"the actions of the authorities decreased volatility on the lira in the short-term, but is unlikely to provide support to the lira in the longer run.\" ABN&nbsp; says \"foreign investors are able to anticipate market volatility, but not erratic action by the authorities that result in the drying up of liquidity in currency and interest rate markets. Moreover, the refusal of Turkey to stop the purchase of the Russian missile defence system S-400 could potentially lead to another stand-off between Turkey and the US.\" These come amid a backdrop of cooling global growth, and ABN thinks investors will shy away from Turkey going forward, resulting in a weaker lira against the dollar. The bank cuts its forecast for the USDTRY to 6.0 from 5.20.</p>",

In fact, it appears yields are set for the biggest-single day rise in around three-months (2s yields +5.3bps at settle, 5s yields +6.9bps, 10s yields +8.2bps, 30s yields +7bps). Major curves bear-steepened modestly (1.2bps to 2.6bps), though 10s30s saw some small narrowing. The much-watched 3m/10yr spread moved back into positive territory with reassuring global growth signs (ex-EZ PMIs); while this spread is only a symptom of a much larger cause, analysts seem to be more generally buying-into the argument presented by some Fed officials of late, which suggested that structural factors have diminished the recession signal, though the growth concerns remain valid.</p>",

It helped the activity currencies (AUD, NZD, CAD). The JPY was weaker, underpinned by a weak Tankan report overnight, while the US 3m/10yr curve exited inversion. The TRY managed to recoup sharp losses after Turkey's local elections, while the ZAR caught a bid after Moody's delayed its review on the South Africa's ratings.

Nevertheless, Capital Economics' analysts see upside for the GBP in the month's ahead. Currently, GBP is being split by numerous soft and hard Brexit options, and as these are removed, the path to a softer Brexit could help support the pound, the argument goes. However, amid all the optimism, it is worth reiterating that if Parliament cannot give EU policymakers a convincing game plan for why the Article 50 process should be extended, the default position remains that the UK will leave on 12 April, without a deal; it is worth adding that many are expecting movement before this happens, but we would not that Brexit optimism doesn't have a great track record of showing follow-through.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Moody's delayed its rating review of South Africa on Friday (the consensus was looking for an unchanged Baa3/stable, though some had expected an outlook revision, or an outright downgrade). ZAR traders have reacted positively, seeing USDZAR fall by over 2%. However, this seems like just a delay; RBC argues that the CRA may be waiting for greater clarity that will be seen after May's elections, however, it buys the nation more time to implement changes to maintain its final investment grade rating.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> Turkish local elections have seen President Erdogan's AKP party lost control of capital Ankara, as well as other key large cities (though they are set to contest the outcome).

However, the Eurozone gauge came in weaker, and below the 50 level. March OPEC surveys have begun hitting; Reuters’ poll sees oil output falling 280k BPD M/M, to 30.4mln BPD (the lowest since 2015); members subject to the supply-cut deal are seen to achieve 135% compliance, compared to 101% in the prior month, with Saudi and Venezuela posting the largest production declines, which isn’t too surprising given that Saudi is spearheading the cuts and Venezuela’s inability to produce gives it little choice. Elsewhere, the Iranian Oil Minister said it should be easy to extend the OPEC+ supply cut deal; the Russian Central Bank says it does not rule out an extension of OPEC+ output agreements into H2 2019; Iraqi crude oil exports reached 3.377mln BPD in March vs. 3.62mln in February, with oil exports from southern ports at 3.254mln bpd, according to the Oil Ministry, which contradicts the 3.45mln figure given last week by Iraqi officials.</p>",

It is not yet clear if the same voting system will be used as the first time, i.e. a yes/no vote. A different method may be used to avoid no majority on the motions:</p><ul><li><strong>STRAIGHT VOTES</strong>: Indicative votes usually take the form of a series of votes where MPs can express their support or disapproval for each individual motion. The method usually used to vote in the HoC</li><li><strong>PREFERENTIAL VOTING:</strong> MPs could also be asked to rank different options in order of preference which can then be counted under an Alternative vote system. If any single option receives a majority of first-preference votes, that option will be chosen.</li><li><strong>EXHAUSTIVE BALLOT:</strong> If no options command majority, then the option with the lowest number of first preference votes would be eliminated. The vote would then reach a second stage (and so on) and those who voted for the eliminated option would be allocated amongst the remaining options</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TUESDAY/THURSDAY:</strong>&nbsp;Potentially May's next opportunity to present her deal to Parliament for vote again.</p><ul><li><i>N.B.

Risks: no majority prevails again; could be pointless if May presents her deal again in the wake, and it that passes.</li><li><strong>(2) May brings her deal back:</strong>&nbsp;Talks continue to convince the dissenting Tories and DUP lawmakers (34 and 10 respectively), although it seems unlikely. However, May is pitting her deal against options which are unpopular to many Tories (A Norway model, or second referendum); but many of her Party would likely prefer a no deal.</li><li><strong>(3) MPs vote for a second referendum (a confirmatory referendum on any deal agreed by Parliament).&nbsp;</strong>This was motion that garnered most support at last week’s indicative votes, though failed to generate a majority. Has opposition support, and still an option to be used as an amendment in future legislation. Limited Conservative support. Could be divisive for the country.</li><li><strong>(4) No deal.</strong>&nbsp;Parliament fails to agree and the default remains the UK will leave the EU on 12 April, despite lawmakers having ruled-out this scenario in multiple votes previously. Unless a credible plan is presented to the EU by 10/Apr, there is a risk that some may be reluctant to accept any extension request, and therefore, an exit could happen by accident.</li><li><strong>(5) May tries to call an election.&nbsp;</strong>This has been hinted before as a warning to back May; opposition has already called for an election. Could lead to the EU granting a longer extension, and the UK participating in EU Parliament elections 23-26 May.</li></ul><p><strong>*BANK THOUGHTS:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Goldman Sachs believes that the balance of risks surrounding Brexit outcome is tilted to a softer and longer departure. Chances of a modified version of PM May’s deal at 45% (Prev. 50%). Probability of a “no deal” Brexit maintained at 15% and chance of a “no Brexit” raised to 40% (Prev. 35%)</li><li>Deutsche Bank says likelihood of a no-deal Brexit (on April 12th) to 25% (Prev. 20%), base case is now a general election. Deutsche Bank targets EUR/GBP at 0.90 due to the increasingly high probability of no-deal Brexit. Bank says 15% chance Parliament will fail to reach consensus on Indicative votes</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/4eb0cbb6-56aa-46f8-ab2f-655e3bf5328b.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has extended recovery gains in the run up to more indicative voting in Parliament amidst whipping and posturing behind various motions that were given the thumbs down last time, but could receive more backing after PM May’s WA was rejected for a 3rd time last Friday. Cable inched further above 1.3100 to around 1.3125 before fading and Eur/Gbp retreated from circa 0.8625 to just shy of 0.8560, with the Pound deriving support from significantly stronger than forecast UK manufacturing PMI. However, hopes for a softer Brexit if the Customs Union or Common Market 2 alternative options gather momentum or go head-to-head with May’s deal on Wednesday and win are underpinning the Gbp in the main. Note, the Speaker of the HoC is due to select motions shortly and we have a running Brexit analysis post that is regularly updated on our headline feed.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi have lost a bit of their post-Chinese PMI euphoria, and their place at the summit of the G10 table to the Pound in wake of the aforementioned upbeat UK PMI and going into the latest round of Brexit IVs. Aud/Usd remains comfortably above the 0.7100 handle and the 50 DMA at 0.7119, while Nzd/Usd is holding towards the upper end of a 0.6810-37 range amidst broader Greenback weakness post-US retail sales data vs upbeat manufacturing ISM – more on this below. Looking ahead, the Aud may succumb to some pre-RBA jitters and position</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar and index have regrouped with the aid of a US manufacturing ISM beat and encouraging sub-components, but remain depressed after another disappointing retail sales report, as the DXY struggles to fully recover within a relatively tight 97.026-281 range.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has stalled amidst mostly bleak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and the post-ISM Greenback bounce, but has so far resisted selling pressure ahead of 1.1200, as another ECB member hints at reluctance or reservations to the idea of tiered deposits. However, the <strong>NOK</strong> and <strong>SEK </strong>both maintained gains vs the Eur following faster Norwegian and Swedish manufacturing PMI activity and with the former also fuelled by perky oil prices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>All ending Monday’s EU session on the back foot and underperforming their major peers, as the Loonie weakened in wake of a worrying Canadian manufacturing PMI to 1.3370 vs around 1.3335 pre-release, and the Franc was undermined by a similar slowdown in the Swiss version and weak retail sales, retreating from 0.9936 to 0.9980. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy consolidated above 111.00 and briefly pierced a Fib at 111.20 on the back of an upturn in risk sentiment and a firmer rebound in US Treasury yields.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>A very volatile day for the Try with initial weakness down to 5.7030 seen vs the Usd after weekend Turkish elections appeared to have handed key cities, Istanbul and Ankara to President Erdogan’s main opposition, but then the Lira rebounding towards 5.5200 as the ruling AK Party contested results and launched.&nbsp;</p>",

Hence, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both looking firmer above big figure levels at 0.7100 and 0.6800 respectively, with the former also probing above its 50 DMA (0.7119), while Cable extended its rebound from last week’s lows and back over 1.3000 to circa 1.3100, breaching its 55 DMA (1.3075) on the way. However, the latest round of IVs present more risk and uncertainty for the Pound with up to 8 amendments up for selection around 2.30 pm before debates and voting tonight – for a more detailed schedule and analysis see our headline feed. Elsewhere, Eur/Nok is back down below 9.6500 and Eur/Sek sub-10.4000 to test multi technical support levels including the 30 DMA (10.3844), 200 DMA (10.3812) and the bottom of a chart cloud (10.3785). Back down under, and the Aud will be looking for independent impetus via the RBA tomorrow with options pricing a 35 pip break-even for the event – full preview also available via the headline feed.</p><p>EUR/CHF - Also firmer vs the Usd as the DXY retreats towards 97.000 again, but capped around 1.1250 and 0.9935 respectively in wake of relatively downbeat PMIs and Swiss retail sales.</p><p>CAD/JPY - The G10 laggards, as the Loonie meanders between 1.3340-30 vs its US counterpart and the Jpy pivots 111.00 amidst the aforementioned general revival in risk appetite post-Chinese PMIs, and with the headline pair also underpinned by a downbeat Japanese Tankan report. However, 111.20 is holding (just) and represents a 61.8% Fib retracement of the 112.13-109.70 downmove.</p><p>EM - Contrasting fortunes for the Lira and Rand, as weekend municipal elections in Turkey saw some key losses for the ruling AK Party to main opposition CHP, but not enough to threaten President Erdogan’s overall majority and result in regime change. Usd/Try has been up to 5.7000+ in response vs Usd/Zar that has been as low as 14.2225 after Moody’s delayed its latest credit review of SA and any potential cut in the rating and/or outlook, for the time being at least.</p><p>Turkey opposition party claimed victory in Istanbul and Ankara, while the ruling AK Party also initially claimed to have won in Istanbul following local elections over the weekend which was seen as a referendum on President Erdogan. However. President Erdogan later commented that although the Mayorship may have been lost in Istanbul, they won in many of its municipalities. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Stock-piling certainly boosted the UK manufacturing PMI, but stock-taking appears to have contributed to the demise of Gilts and Bunds in recent trade following fleeting and mixed recoveries ahead of the Markit/CIPS release (which for the record was on time unlike the premature Eurozone surveys). The 10 year UK benchmark retested bids ahead of 129.00 again, having peered 1 tick above par at 129.38, while its Eurex equivalent has actually fallen to a fresh session low at 165.68 (-66 ticks) amidst extended gains in the Dax other EU bourses. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain closer to overnight lows with the curve steeper again ahead of top-tier data in the form of retail sales, manufacturing PMI/ISM business inventories and construction spending.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The upbeat sentiment emanating from the optimistic China metrics overnight has supported sentiment alongside the demand outlook for the energy complex. Brent futures are marching with gains of around USD 1.0/bbl while WTI futures advance over USD 0.50/bbl. Brent oil has reached levels last seen in November, and from a technical front, the 200 DMA for Brent resides around USD 69.68/bbl and around USD 61.50/bbl for WTI. Furthermore, BAML expects Brent to average USD 74/bbl in Q2 2019, and USD 70/bbl in 2019. Meanwhile, the bank sees WTI averaging USD 56/bbl in 2019 and USD 60/bbl in 2020. Elsewhere, the latest CFTC data shows that speculative net long NYMEX WTI by almost 26k lots over last week, with a bulk of the buying coming from fresh longs. Of note, this month sees the EIA short-term energy outlook release on the 9th, OPEC monthly report on the 10th and IAE oil market report the day after. It is also worth noting that traders will be keeping an eye on trade developments as US is to host a Chinese trade delegation on the 3rd.</p><p>Over in the metals complex, gold prices succumb to the positive risk tone as the yellow metal remains below the USD 1300/oz, albeit off lows. Meanwhile, the aforementioned China data bolstered copper prices to levels just shy of USD 3.00/lb, to levels last seen in June 2018. Elsewhere, iron ore prices have been supported by the Caixin-beat alongside a force majeure by Rio Tinto which will result in a loss of around 14mln tonnes of production this year. As such, Goldman Sachs raised iron ore price forecasts with 3-month estimate at USD 85/ton (Prev. USD 80), 6-month estimate at USD 80/ton (Prev. USD 75/ton) and 1-year estimate at USD 70/ton (Prev. USD 65).</p><p>The Omani oil minister says that he sees prices staying in a USD 65-75 range until year-end.

However, the latest round of IVs present more risk and uncertainty for the Pound with up to 8 amendments up for selection around 2.30 pm before debates and voting tonight – for a more detailed schedule and analysis see our headline feed. Elsewhere, Eur/Nok is back down below 9.6500 and Eur/Sek sub-10.4000 to test multi technical support levels including the 30 DMA (10.3844), 200 DMA (10.3812) and the bottom of a chart cloud (10.3785). Back down under, and the Aud will be looking for independent impetus via the RBA tomorrow with options pricing a 35 pip break-even for the event – full preview also available via the headline feed.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs the Usd as the <strong>DXY </strong>retreats towards 97.000 again, but capped around 1.1250 and 0.9935 respectively in wake of relatively downbeat PMIs and Swiss retail sales.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The G10 laggards, as the Loonie meanders between 1.3340-30 vs its US counterpart and the Jpy pivots 111.00 amidst the aforementioned general revival in risk appetite post-Chinese PMIs, and with the headline pair also underpinned by a downbeat Japanese Tankan report. However, 111.20 is holding (just) and represents a 61.8% Fib retracement of the 112.13-109.70 downmove.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Lira and Rand, as weekend municipal elections in Turkey saw some key losses for the ruling AK Party to main opposition CHP, but not enough to threaten President Erdogan’s overall majority and result in regime change. Usd/Try has been up to 5.7000+ in response vs Usd/Zar that has been as low as 14.2225 after Moody’s delayed its latest credit review of SA and any potential cut in the rating and/or outlook, for the time being at least.</p>",

This gives the UK less than 2 weeks until its exit date on April 12th and Parliament is to conduct another round of indicative votes today where MPs are likely to revisit the options that previously garnered the most support which called for a Customs Union with the EU and Confirmatory Referendum. Furthermore, some reports have also suggested outside risks of a snap election which Tory Party Deputy Chairman Cleverly was quick to dismiss, while not all are fazed by the ongoing uncertainty with Goldman Sachs suggesting near-term risks are skewed to the upside for <strong>GBP</strong> on condition that the indicative vote process is moving along. Elsewhere, antipodeans were underpinned by the risk sentiment and strong Chinese data, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was also lifted above 111.00 on safe-haven outflows and following a deterioration in the Tankan survey which showed the Large Manufacturing Index at a 2yr low.</p><p>Turkey opposition party claimed victory in Istanbul and Ankara, while the ruling AK Party also initially claimed to have won in Istanbul following local elections over the weekend which was seen as a referendum on President Erdogan.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the new quarter on the front-foot with momentum sustained from last Friday’s global rally in which the S&amp;P 500 notched its best quarterly performance in nearly a decade and as the region also cheered encouraging Chinese PMI data. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) gained from the open in which Consumer Staples led the broad gains across Australia’s sectors after Woolworths completed the sale of its petrol business and announced to return funds through a AUD 1.7bln off-market buyback, while the Japanese benchmark shrugged off a weak Tankan survey and was among the best performers with risk appetite fuelled by favourable currency flows. Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.3%) were uplifted by strong Chinese data in which the Official Manufacturing, Non-Manufacturing and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs all topped estimates with the official reading in expansionary territory for the first time since October.&nbsp; Furthermore, trade optimism and the inclusion of China’s onshore bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index from today further added to the optimism with the mainland firmly extending on the over-3% gains seen on Friday and with the Hang Seng now in bull market territory. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid similar weakness in T-notes and as a rally across riskier assets dampened safe-haven demand, while the BoJ recently announced its purchase intentions for the month in which it kept all amounts unchanged.</p>",

This gives the UK less than 2 weeks until its exit date and Parliament is to conduct another round of indicative votes today where MPs are likely to revisit the options that previously garnered the most support which called for a Customs Union with the EU and Confirmatory Referendum. Furthermore, some reports have also suggested outside risks of a snap election which Tory Party Deputy Chairman Cleverly was quick to dismiss, while not all are fazed by the ongoing uncertainty with Goldman Sachs suggesting near-term risks are skewed to the upside for GBP on condition that the indicative vote process is moving along. Elsewhere, antipodeans are underpinned by the risk sentiment and strong Chinese data, while USD/JPY is also lifted on safe-haven outflows and following a deterioration in the Tankan survey which showed the Large Manufacturing Index at a 2yr low.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices dampened amid similar weakness in T-notes and as a rally across riskier assets dampened safe-haven demand, while the BoJ recently announced its purchase intentions for the month in which it kept all amounts unchanged.</p>",
