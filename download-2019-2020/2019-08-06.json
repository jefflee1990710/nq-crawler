The optimism was inspired by the PBOC, which fixed the yuan stronger than expected overnight (at 6.9683 vs expectations it would be fixed in the 6.98 area) which relieved the pressure in the Treasury complex, where yields have inched up, though have yet to pare back the slide seen on Monday. In stock specific news, TransDigm (TDG) soared after top and bottom-line earnings beats, further supported by stellar guidance above expectations on both FY EPS and revenue metrics. The name provided a heavy boost to the industrials sector, which was one of the leading sectors in Tuesday trade. Gaming names were all lifted following Rockstar earnings from Take-Two (TTWO) which saw gains as high as 10% in the session after earnings beats as well as a strong 2020 outlook, which led to a slew of price target upgrades from the likes of BAML, Morgan Stanley, Bernstein and many more. Following the positive outlook Electronic Arts (EA) &amp; Activision Blizzard (ATVI) also benefited. Mosaic (MOS) hit the materials sector after top and bottom-line misses as well as issuing soft guidance, which also saw Nutrien (NTR) and Dow Inc (DOW) lower. Elsewhere in materials, International Flavours and Fragrances (IFF) were heavily hit after cutting its FY revenue guidance. According to people familiar with the matter, drug distributors who deliver the majority of prescription medicines to pharmacies in the US, such as McKesson (MCK), Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC), have offered state legislators USD 10bln for opioid lawsuit settlement, a first step towards resolving the state lawsuits against the distributors. In corporate issuance, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) launched a 10-parter M&amp;A bond to fund its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (APC), with the deal valued at USD 38bln. Snap (SNAP) were lower after it announced a proposed private offering of USD 1bln of convertible senior notes set to mature on August 1st, 2026 with net proceeds potentially being used to purchase businesses, products, services or technologies and share repurchases. Other notable movers included FedEx (FDX) which was higher after reports Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square holds a new activist stake in the company. DuPont (DD) shot higher after source reports it is considering the sale of its nutrition biosciences unit, which is reportedly worth at least USD 20bln. Those boosted by earnings include KLA Tencor (KLAC), Discovery (DISCA), Duke Energy (DUK), Emerson (EMR), Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Digital Realty Corp. (O) &amp; Zoetis (ZTS). Names who were hit on poor earnings include Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Marriot (MAR) &amp; Aecom (ACM). In broker moves, Ford (F) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were higher after an upgrade at Morgan Stanley to Overweight from Equalweight. For Ford (F), the analyst noted that Ford's partnerships and \"more focused\" model line-up should keep its profitability \"largely stable\" through 2022. In today’s downgrades, AB InBev (BUD) were downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS and miners BHP (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) were downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies. S&amp;P 500 1.3% AT 2882, NASDAQ-100 1.4% AT 7521, DJIA 1.2% at 26032.</p><p>Treasury yields rose slightly on Tuesday, but could not pare back Monday’s gains; the curve was bear-flattening in early trade, and continued to do so through the session, but yields are mixed at settlement (2s yields +2.8bps, 5s +1bps, 10s +0.3bps, 30s -3.1bps). Net/net, however, the bias was towards flattening, with major spreads coming in modestly. The Treasury sold 3-year debt at the lowest yield at auction since 2017, at 1.562%, stopping through by 0.1bps. Cover was a touch softer than recent averages however. Participation metrics were in line with recent averages; dealers took 34.01% (vs. 6-auction average 36.9%), directs took 19.3% (vs. 6-auction average 16.3%), indirects took 46.66% (vs. 6-auction average 46.8%). The auction was generally considered solid, showing demand remains in the front-end of the curve. US T-note futures (U9) settled 2+ ticks lower at 129-24+.</p>",

The optimism was inspired by the PBOC, which fixed the yuan stronger overnight (at 6.9683 vs expectations it would be fixed in the 6.98 area) which relieved the pressure in the Treasury complex, where yields have inched up, though have yet to pare back the slide seen on Monday. Analysts are generally of the view that while the labelling China as an FX manipulator complicates trade negotiations between the two nations, it lacks teeth, and does little to alter capital flows. However, it does send a broader signal that the US and China remain far apart on trade, and with interactions becoming more confrontational, it diminishes the already dim prospects of reaching a trade deal any time soon; in fact, if anything, it raises the spectre of more confrontation, and that could lead to extreme FOMC pricing kicking in.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP/CHINA:</strong> US President Trump claimed “massive amounts” of money from China is pouring into the US, “for reasons of safety, investment, and interest rates.” He added that the US was in a strong position.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* KUDLOW/CHINA: </strong>NEC Director Kudlow said the US still plans on Chinese trade team coming to the US in September. Kudlow said that Trump would like to continue negotiations and make a deal, adding that things could change with regards to additional tariffs if things go well. Kudlow repeated the Trump line that the US is in terrific shape, while China was not. On the yuan, Kudlow noted it had depreciated by 10% over the last year, which he found unacceptable; Kudlow noted this mitigates some of the price rises on US consumers, but said it was not the right way of doing it. Elsewhere, Kudlow claimed that just in intellectual property theft alone, if US were to recover what we have lost to China, it could be as much as USD 600bln [note, Kudlow did not provide a timeframe].</p><p><strong>* ANALYSIS: CHINA FX MANIPULATION: </strong>Following China authorities' allowing of the yuan to weaken passed 7.00 against the USD, the Treasury designated China a currency manipulator, despite only meeting one of the three criteria in the recent semi-annual report (the criteria it met is a large bi-lateral trade surplus above USD 20bln; analysts do not believe conditions of a current account surplus above 2% and large one-sided FX interventions tests have been satisfied). <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-names-china-fx-manipulator-06-08-2019\">Read full analysis</a>.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> There was much attention on comments from dove <strong>Bullard</strong>, who in July had signalled that a 50bps rate cut might be too excessive. Bullard seems to be taking a data-dependent approach on rates, arguing that they are in ‘the right neighbourhood’; Bullard also argued that the Fed should not react to a ‘tit for tat’ trade war. Bullard said that conditions were not in place for a 50bps cut, arguing that it was not clear that the Fed wanted to pile on more stimulus until it was clear how far the moves would impact the economy. Bullard would not, however, rule out more policy changes ahead. With Bullard taking a more circumspect approach not explicitly endorsing further rate cuts at this stage, analysts question whether the dovish Fed pricing – where money markets now imply a 17% chance of a 50bps rate cut in September, similar to what it was pricing into the July meeting – may have once again gone too far. Meanwhile, <strong>White House trade advisor Navarro</strong> called on the Fed to cut rates by another 75bps, or by a full point before the end of 2019, to bring US rates in line with those elsewhere. Elsewhere, analysts at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> now see further rate cuts, projecting another rate cut in September and in October (<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/fed-watch-goldman-sees-further-fed-rate-cuts-watch-out-for-bullard-comments-later-today-06-08-2019\">read full analysis</a>).</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA:</strong> North Korea conducted another projectile launch overnight, as it announced that the US and South Korea joint military drills violated existing agreements, adding that it is committed to dialogue, but could take a new path. North Korea later told the UN that the drills could lead it to reconsider “major steps” it has already taken.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> China may escort its own commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf waters under the US’ new proposal for a maritime coalition to secure oil shipping lanes, according to the Chinese Envoy to the UAE. On one hand, it is in China’s interests to help support the safe navigation of oil out of the Strait of Hormuz, owing to their dependence on imported oil that flows through the region (Note: China is the largest importer of oil that passes through the Strait). On the other hand, China has existing ties with Iran and continues to import Iranian crude despite US sanctions, which would naturally make China-bound ships less of a “target” for the Iranians.</p><p><strong>* EIA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> The EIA cut its 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 70k bpd to +1.0mln BPD Y/Y, but raised 2020 world oil demand growth by 30k bpd to a +1.43mln bpd Y/Y. The EIA also sees US crude output rising by 1.28mln bpd to 12.27mln bpd in 2019 (prev. a 1.4mln bpd increase), and also sees it rising by 990k bpd to 13.26mln bpd in 2020 (prev. a 900k bpd increase).</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLED USD 1.06 LOWER AT 53.63/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLED USD 0.87 LOWER AT USD 58.94/BBL:</strong> Crude benchmarks were lightly bid in early trade, where Brent was struggling to hold its premium above the USD 60/bbl handle, before drifting lower. Following Monday’s sharp sell-off in equity markets, there had been a mild pick-up in sentiment which was lending its hand over to energy markets, although participants were treading carefully in the wake of 2019’s largest price declines (equities yesterday and crude last Thursday). Supply news flow remained light, but even if there were more, it’s debatable how influential it could be in regard to tape action given the energy market’s fixation on global demand concerns of late. However, the API is to report US inventories after the bell ahead of the EIA on Wednesday, where participants will be paying attention to whether the string of crude draws can be maintained. The consensus expects headline US crude stocks to draw by 2.8mln bbls, distillates are seen building 0.5mln bbls, while gasoline is expected to draw by 0.7mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLES 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 129-24+:</strong> Treasury yields rose slightly on Tuesday, but could not pare back Monday’s gains; the curve was bear-flattening in early trade, and continued to do so through the session, but yields are mixed at settlement (2s yields +2.8bps, 5s +1bps, 10s +0.3bps, 30s -3.1bps). Net/net, however, the bias was towards flattening, with major spreads coming in modestly. The Treasury sold 3-year debt at the lowest yield at auction since 2017, at 1.562%, stopping through by 0.1bps. Cover was a touch softer than recent averages however. Participation metrics were in line with recent averages; dealers took 34.01% (vs. 6-auction average 36.9%), directs took 19.3% (vs. 6-auction average 16.3%), indirects took 46.66% (vs. 6-auction average 46.8%). The auction was generally considered solid, showing demand remains in the front-end of the curve.</p><p><strong>* 10-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>SocGen's analysts are positive on Wednesday’ 10-year auction. The Bank notes that the 10-year sector does not have clear set-up from a relative-value perspective, saying it is trading cheap in asset swap, whereas it trades fair/slightly rich on the curve versus the 5s and 30s wings. SocGen says that, \"although the 10-year sector appears rich on the 2s10s curve because of the flattening that it has undergone since the July FOMC meeting, current political and economic qualms are likely to put a cap on 10-year yields unless there is appeasement on the trade and currency front.\" Likewise, it says that the current 10-year note is trading special in repo, which could be a positive for the auction, as is supportive demand from dealers due to their relatively low holdings in the 7-11-year sector. \"However, with the current WI yield well below all auction stops since September 2016, the auction will likely need a concession to go well.\"</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1.3% AT 2882, NASDAQ-100 1.4% AT 7521, DOW JONES 1.2% AT 26032, SECTORS:</strong> S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; 1%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; -0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; 1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; 1.3%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; 1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; 1.6%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.4%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; 1.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>TransDigm (TDG) soared after top and bottom-line earnings beats, further supported by stellar guidance above expectations on both FY EPS and revenue metrics. The name provided a heavy boost to the industrials sector, which was one of the leading sectors in Tuesday trade. Gaming names were all lifted following Rockstar earnings from Take-Two (TTWO) which saw gains as high as 10% in the session after earnings beats as well as a strong 2020 outlook, which led to a slew of price target upgrades from the likes of BAML, Morgan Stanley, Bernstein and many more. Following the positive outlook Electronic Arts (EA) &amp; Activision Blizzard (ATVI) also benefited. Mosaic (MOS) hit the materials sector after top and bottom-line misses as well as issuing soft guidance, which also saw Nutrien (NTR) and Dow Inc (DOW) lower. Elsewhere in materials, International Flavours and Fragrances (IFF) were heavily hit after cutting its FY revenue guidance. According to people familiar with the matter, drug distributors who deliver the majority of prescription medicines to pharmacies in the US, such as McKesson (MCK), Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC), have offered state legislators USD 10bln for opioid lawsuit settlement, a first step towards resolving the state lawsuits against the distributors. In corporate issuance, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) launched a 10-parter M&amp;A bond to fund its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (APC), with the deal valued at USD 38bln. Snap (SNAP) were lower after it announced a proposed private offering of USD 1bln of convertible senior notes set to mature on August 1st, 2026 with net proceeds potentially being used to purchase businesses, products, services or technologies and share repurchases. Other notable movers included FedEx (FDX) which was higher after reports Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square holds a new activist stake in the company. DuPont (DD) shot higher after source reports it is considering the sale of its nutrition biosciences unit, which is reportedly worth at least USD 20bln. Those boosted by earnings include KLA Tencor (KLAC), Discovery (DISCA), Duke Energy (DUK), Emerson (EMR), Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Digital Realty Corp. (O) &amp; Zoetis (ZTS). Names who were hit on poor earnings include Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Marriot (MAR) &amp; Aecom (ACM). In broker moves, Ford (F) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were higher after an upgrade at Morgan Stanley to Overweight from Equalweight. For Ford (F), the analyst noted that Ford's partnerships and \"more focused\" model line-up should keep its profitability \"largely stable\" through 2022. In today’s downgrades, AB InBev (BUD) were downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS and miners BHP (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) were downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The Telegraph reports that between 20-30 Labour lawmakers would vote for a Brexit deal if PM Johnson secured further concessions from the EU, with the article also noting that backchannels have opened up between the opposition backbenches and the government, which the market will see as a small positive sign. However, even that news is not helping to shift EU rhetoric, which has said that there is no basis for further negotiations while the UK is looking to change Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement. Cabinet Minister Gove said the EU was refusing to negotiate with the UK on a Brexit deal; later, a senior UK government source said that Britain does want a deal, and it is sad that the EU does not want to negotiate. Irish PM Varadkar leaned back against the story, but his position remains that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be re-negotiated. Before the European close, news emerged that a cross-party group of lawmakers is launching legal action in an attempt to prevent UK PM Johnson suspending Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ PREVIEW:&nbsp;</strong>The RBNZ is expected to cut the Official Cash Rate by 25bps to 1.25% with markets pricing a 100% chance of a 25bps cut, as well as a 71% chance for a further 25bps cut to 1.00% by November. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22470/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* RBI PREVIEW: </strong>RBI is expected to cut the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate by 25bps each to 5.50% and 5.25% respectively, while the Cash Reserve Ratio is expected to be kept at 4.00%. Rate cuts could be seen as a move to appease the government. Recent data suggests there is room to reduce rates. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22473/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:&nbsp;</strong>There was a walking back of some of the risk-off flows seen on Monday, in wake of a ramp-up in trade tensions between the US and China. The more constructive price action came as the PBOC overnight guided its <strong>CNY</strong> fixing firmer against the dollar than analysts were expecting (however, the offshore yuan remains above 7.00 vs the USD). It resulted in a stronger <strong>USD</strong>, though the DXY is yet to fully claw back Monday’s losses, but trades back above 97.5; traders are also cognizant of steps the US could take, and analysts still suspect FX intervention is among the options the White House might consider in the months ahead, as well as potential loosening of monetary policy settings. The <strong>EUR</strong> gave back some of its gains, and is consolidating around the 1.12 figure, as traders await further catalysts; German industrial orders were good, although there are still questions over the future. The recovery in risk appetite helped havens unwind, with <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> lower on the day (though, curiously, <strong>Treasuries</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> were in positive territory). <strong>GBP</strong> news flow is once again focussing on the risks of a no deal Brexit, not that sterling traders were concerned, with the pound modestly higher above 1.2150. The <strong>AUD</strong> is flat, giving back gains after a record trade surplus was reported overnight; the slide in copper, iron ore and crude also contributed to some weakness. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed, generally higher, with the notable exception of <strong>ZAR</strong>, where Moody’s said state utility Eskom’s finances were not sustainable, raising the spectre of further government assistance.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> As the PBOC Governor said on Monday, the yuan could always bounce back to sub-7.00, and overnight the PBOC fixed the yuan reference rate stronger. The central bank also announced a CNY 30bln bill sale in Hong Kong, for 14th August - these operations have allowed the central bank to control yuan liquidity, and analysts say the auction will help to drain offshore liquidity, making it more expensive to short the yuan.</p><p><strong>* EMFX:</strong> SocGen says that the re-emergence of FX weakness has put the brakes on policy easing. The bank notes that Brazil and South Africa got their latest cuts away in time, but the circumstances have now changed. And in the case of India, that means bets could be off for a 25bps cut by the RBI on Thursday as USDINR takes off above 70.70.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> The RBA held its Cash Rate at 1.0%, as was expected. In the statement, the central bank adopted an easing bias, pledging to \"ease monetary policy further if needed\"; the new guidance was accompanied by downgrades to growth, with the central bank noting that uncertainties had increased amid trade wars. The Board also seems optimistic about the government's tax cuts, which might boost household disposable income, and also \"signs of a turnaround\" in the labour market. Elsewhere, data showed that the Aussie trade surplus widened to a record USD 8bln, and will make a large contribution to GDP growth in Q2. Exports were boosted, though imports dropped to the weakest since 2016.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> SocGen's strategists note that in trade weighted terms (where the yuan takes the largest weighting) is nearer to the 2018 highs than the spot EUR rate implies. Meanwhile, German factory orders rebounded in July (though is still negative Y/Y). Analysts note, however, that the rebound in new orders was led by foreign demand, and accordingly, the prospects for a sustained rebound through the rest of the year seem remote given that the shadow of trade wars still looms large over markets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> BRC data showed retail sales back in positive territory in Y/Y terms, following declines of 1.3% and 2.7% in June and May respectively. Data from credit card provider Barclaycard also showed that consumer spending grew by 1.7% M/M in July, the fastest since April.</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP:&nbsp;</strong>There was a walking back of some of the risk-off flows seen on Monday, in wake of a ramp-up in trade tensions between the US and China. The more constructive price action came as the PBOC overnight guided its <strong>CNY</strong> fixing firmer against the dollar than analysts were expecting (however, the offshore yuan remains above 7.00 vs the USD). It resulted in a stronger <strong>USD</strong>, though the DXY is yet to fully claw back Monday’s losses, but trades back above 97.5; traders are also cognizant of steps the US could take, and analysts still suspect FX intervention is among the options the White House might consider in the months ahead, as well as potential loosening of monetary policy settings. The <strong>EUR</strong> gave back some of its gains, and is consolidating around the 1.12 figure, as traders await further catalysts; German industrial orders were good, although there are still questions over the future. The recovery in risk appetite helped havens unwind, with <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> lower on the day (though, curiously, <strong>Treasuries</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> were in positive territory). <strong>GBP</strong> news flow is once again focussing on the risks of a no deal Brexit, not that sterling traders were concerned, with the pound modestly higher above 1.2150. The <strong>AUD</strong> is flat, giving back gains after a record trade surplus was reported overnight; the slide in copper, iron ore and crude also contributed to some weakness. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed, generally higher, with the notable exception of <strong>ZAR</strong>, where Moody’s said state utility Eskom’s finances were not sustainable, raising the spectre of further government assistance.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> As the PBOC Governor said on Monday, the yuan could always bounce back to sub-7.00, and overnight the PBOC fixed the yuan reference rate stronger. The central bank also announced a CNY 30bln bill sale in Hong Kong, for 14th August - these operations have allowed the central bank to control yuan liquidity, and analysts say the auction will help to drain offshore liquidity, making it more expensive to short the yuan.</p><p><strong>* EMFX:</strong> SocGen says that the re-emergence of FX weakness has put the brakes on policy easing. The bank notes that Brazil and South Africa got their latest cuts away in time, but the circumstances have now changed. And in the case of India, that means bets could be off for a 25bps cut by the RBI on Thursday as USDINR takes off above 70.70.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> The RBA held its Cash Rate at 1.0%, as was expected. In the statement, the central bank adopted an easing bias, pledging to \"ease monetary policy further if needed\"; the new guidance was accompanied by downgrades to growth, with the central bank noting that uncertainties had increased amid trade wars. The Board also seems optimistic about the government's tax cuts, which might boost household disposable income, and also \"signs of a turnaround\" in the labour market. Elsewhere, data showed that the Aussie trade surplus widened to a record USD 8bln, and will make a large contribution to GDP growth in Q2. Exports were boosted, though imports dropped to the weakest since 2016.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> SocGen's strategists note that in trade weighted terms (where the yuan takes the largest weighting) is nearer to the 2018 highs than the spot EUR rate implies. Meanwhile, German factory orders rebounded in July (though is still negative Y/Y). Analysts note, however, that the rebound in new orders was led by foreign demand, and accordingly, the prospects for a sustained rebound through the rest of the year seem remote given that the shadow of trade wars still looms large over markets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> BRC data showed retail sales back in positive territory in Y/Y terms, following declines of 1.3% and 2.7% in June and May respectively. Data from credit card provider Barclaycard also showed that consumer spending grew by 1.7% M/M in July, the fastest since April.</p>",

Following Monday’s sharp sell-off in equity markets, there had been a mild pick-up in sentiment which was lending its hand over to energy markets, although participants were treading carefully in the wake of 2019’s largest price declines (equities yesterday and crude last Thursday). Supply news flow remained light, but even if there were more, it’s debatable how influential it could be in regard to tape action given the energy market’s fixation on global demand concerns of late. However, the API is to report US inventories after the bell ahead of the EIA on Wednesday, where participants will be paying attention to whether the string of crude draws can be maintained. The consensus expects headline US crude stocks to draw by 2.8mln bbls, distillates are seen building 0.5mln bbls, while gasoline is expected to draw by 0.7mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* EIA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> The EIA cut its 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 70k bpd to +1.0mln BPD Y/Y, but raised 2020 world oil demand growth by 30k bpd to a +1.43mln bpd Y/Y. The EIA also sees US crude output rising by 1.28mln bpd to 12.27mln bpd in 2019 (prev. a 1.4mln bpd increase), and also sees it rising by 990k bpd to 13.26mln bpd in 2020 (prev. a 900k bpd increase).</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is back on a more even keel after Monday’s steep declines and bigger losses against safer-havens compared to premiums over riskier rivals. Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>has rebounded relatively firmly from 97.203 lows to just shy of 97.800 as the PBoC allayed some fears about a full-blown currency war after China was officially labelled as a currency manipulator by the US with a lower than forecast or feared Usd/Cny mid-point fix, albeit above yesterday’s setting and closer to 7.0000. Meanwhile, NEC Director Kudlow appeared quite conciliatory in comments when he insisted that President Trump is still open to trade negotiation and Washington is expecting a delegation from Beijing next month, while adding crucially that the US is not contemplating any other steps (measures, sanctions and/or extra tariffs) in respect of latest Yuan FX moves. Moreover, Trump could even change tariffs on the additional Usd300 bn Chinese goods if talks go well. Wednesday’s on-shore reference rate now even more pivotal in terms of the next manoeuvres.</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All beneficiaries of a broad improvement in risk sentiment, or less aversion to be more accurate, with the Aussie and Kiwi also aided by data (trade and labour/earnings respectively) and not unduly dented by dovish RBA and RBNZ policy outlooks. On that note, the former held rates as widely expected, but maintained an easing biased backed up by downgrades to growth and inflation forecasts, while the latter is unanimously expected to cut the NZ OCR by another 25 bp on Wednesday. However, Aud/Usd is hovering just under 0.6800 vs sub-0.6750 at one stage yesterday and Nzd/Usd is ‘comfortably’ above 0.6500 from circa 0.6490 at worst on Monday, with scant reaction to lasts GDT auction prices. Similarly, Sterling and the Scandi Kronas have rebounded, with Cable crossing 1.2200 at best, albeit tentatively, and Eur/Gbp retreating further below 0.9250 and through 0.9200 to circa 0.9267, while Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have backed off from 10.0200 and 10.7680 or so respectively, with steadier crude prices helping the Nok.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>In contrast to the above, demand for the Franc and Yen (alongside Gold to a degree) has waned with Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy up near 0.9800 and 106.50, while the semi-safe Euro has also lost momentum after holding close to decent 1.1190-1.1200 option expiries (1.5 bn) into the NY cut. However, the Loonie has failed to glean support from the aforementioned stabilisation in oil ahead of Canadian Ivey PMIs.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad recovery gains across the region, but the Inr treading cautiously around 70.8600 vs the Usd ahead of tomorrow’s RBI rate meeting and an anticipated 4th consecutive ¼ point ease, though the Krw is on a firmer footing within 1220-1209 parameters into an emergency gathering of South Korea’s monetary authorities at midnight London time to discuss financial market conditions.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.5%)</strong> were pressured by the trade tensions after the US labelled China a currency manipulator whilst China confirmed purchases of US agriculture products have been suspended, although markets found some comfort after the PBoC announced to sell CNY 30bln of bills in Hong Kong and set the reference rate within bounds of the perceived 7.00 line in the sand. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy with early upside seen due to the wide risk averse tone which boosted prices to a fresh record high and dragged the 10yr yields to below -0.2% which was seen to be the bottom end of BoJ’s target. However, prices have since eased back with 10yr JGBs now lower as stocks recovered from lows and after a mixed 30yr auction, while T-notes have also retreated to below the 130.00 level amid a pullback from the recent surge triggered by the trade tensions which also saw the 3m/10yr yield inversion at its most prominent since the GFC.</p><p><strong>PBoC skipped open market operations but announced to sell CNY 30bln of bills in Hong Kong.

Similarly, sectors are in the green though with gains limited and the energy sector unable to breach into positive territory. In terms of individual movers this morning, Vivendi (+7.0%) are in discussions with Tencent for the sale of a 10% stake in Universal Music, with the deal valuing Vinci’s music business at EUR 30bln; since 2018 the Co. has been exploring a partial Universal Music sale with the deal to include the option for a further 10% stake to be purchased in the future. Moving to earnings this morning saw Deutsche Post (+4.3%) update where they beat on Q2 EBIT and their Germany Post &amp; Parcels division posted positive earnings for the first time since Q4 2017. At the other end of the Stoxx spectrum are InterContinental Hotels (-2.4%) as the Co’s revenue did marginally miss on expectations; finally, with nothing fundamentally new from yesterdays pre-market update Metro AG (-6.7%) remain under pressure after further reiteration of comments that Kretinsky’s investment fund will not be increasing their offer for the Co.</p><p>FX</p><p>AUD/NZD - No major surprises from the RBA overnight, but an unexpected boost from trade data revealing a wider than expected and record surplus has helped the Aussie mount a strong recovery from yesterday’s lows with additional support via a Yuan rebound (Usd/Cnh circa 7.0700 vs almost 7.1400 at one stage after a measured/capped 6.9683 Usd/Cny mid-point fix). Aud/Usd is back up near 0.6800 and Aud/Nzd has bounced even further from sub-1.0270 lows towards 1.0400, as the Kiwi also benefited from considerably better than forecast NZ jobs and wage metrics, with Nzd/Usd not far from 0.6600 compared to under 0.6500 at worst on Monday. However, the RBNZ is still seen cutting the OCR by another 25 bp tomorrow and the pair has subsequently eased drifted down to around 0.6550, while Aud/Jpy may lose momentum given mega expiry options at the 72.00 strike (4 bn).</p><p>GBP/NOK/SEK - The Pound has also regained composure amidst a broad stabilisation in risk sentiment, with Cable just surpassing yesterday’s best before stalling into the 1.2200 level and Eur/Gbp reversing from 0.9250 to a few pips below 0.9200 even though no deal Brexit risk is arguably rising.

Similarly, sectors are in the green though with gains limited and the energy sector unable to breach into positive territory. In terms of individual movers this morning, Vivendi (+7.0%) are in discussions with Tencent for the sale of a 10% stake in Universal Music, with the deal valuing Vinci’s music business at EUR 30bln; since 2018 the Co. has been exploring a partial Universal Music sale with the deal to include the option for a further 10% stake to be purchased in the future. Also towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are GEA Group (+5.1%) after beating on Q2 revenue and confirming outlook. Continuing with earnings this morning saw Deutsche Post (+4.3%) update where they beat on Q2 EBIT and their Germany Post &amp; Parcels division posted positive earnings for the first time since Q4 2017. At the other end of the Stoxx spectrum are InterContinental Hotels (-2.4%) as the Co’s revenue did marginally miss on expectations; finally, with nothing fundamentally new from yesterdays pre-market update Metro AG (-6.7%) remain under pressure after further reiteration of comments that Kretinsky’s investment fund will not be increasing their offer for the Co.</p><p>FX</p><p>AUD/NZD - No major surprises from the RBA overnight, but an unexpected boost from trade data revealing a wider than expected and record surplus has helped the Aussie mount a strong recovery from yesterday’s lows with additional support via a Yuan rebound (Usd/Cnh circa 7.0700 vs almost 7.1400 at one stage after a measured/capped 6.9683 Usd/Cny mid-point fix). Aud/Usd is back up near 0.6800 and Aud/Nzd has bounced even further from sub-1.0270 lows towards 1.0400, as the Kiwi also benefited from considerably better than forecast NZ jobs and wage metrics, with Nzd/Usd not far from 0.6600 compared to under 0.6500 at worst on Monday. However, the RBNZ is still seen cutting the OCR by another 25 bp tomorrow and the pair has subsequently eased drifted down to around 0.6550, while Aud/Jpy may lose momentum given mega expiry options at the 72.00 strike (4 bn).</p><p>GBP/NOK/SEK - The Pound has also regained composure amidst a broad stabilisation in risk sentiment, with Cable just surpassing yesterday’s best before stalling into the 1.2200 level and Eur/Gbp reversing from 0.9250 to a few pips below 0.9200 even though no deal Brexit risk is arguably rising. Similar story for the Scandi Crowns that are paring losses vs a steady Euro and with the Nok encouraged by a partial revival in oil as well.</p><p>JPY/CHF - Conversely, the tentative and formative Tuesday turnaround in financial markets/mood has taken its toll on the Yen especially as Usd/Jpy spikes from near 105.50 lows to just over 107.00 before topping out, while the Franc has retreated against the Dollar and Euro to 0.9750+ and 1.0930 respectively compared to almost 0.9700 and 1.0900.</p><p>EUR - In contrast to the Aussie and Kiwi, German factory orders and the construction PMI hardly impacted the single currency even though the former was significantly better than anticipated and the latter lost grip of the 50.0 handle.

        "content": "<ul><li>The ramping of trade tensions has seen traders extend dovish pricing for Fed rate cuts. Markets have priced around 109bps of easing through the end of next year; it was around 70bps in wake of last week’s Fed, where it cut rates by 25bps. Additionally, there is now around a one-in-three chance the Fed will fire a ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps at the September meeting.</li><li>Analysts at Goldman Sachs have now changed their Fed call, and have added one more rate cut to their profile; Goldman is now of the view that both US and China policymakers are pursuing a hard line, and do not see a trade deal being reached before the 2020 Presidential Election in the US. “Financial markets have reacted strongly to the latest trade war news. Our financial conditions index has tightened by 23bp since the July FOMC meeting, and fed funds futures now price another 114bp of cuts by end-2020, up from 70bp after the July meeting.”</li><li>Goldman notes that the Fed has been increasingly responsive to trade threats this year, and the possible impact it could have on global growth. “In light of growing trade policy risks, market expectations for much deeper rate cuts, and an increase in global risk related to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, we now expect a third 25bp rate cut in October, for a total of 75bp of cuts.”</li><li>At the September meeting, Goldman sees a 75% chance of a 25bps cut, a 15% chance of a 50bps cut, and a 10% chance of no cut. For the October meeting, it sees a 50% chance of a 25bps cut, a 10% chance of a 50bps cut, and a 40% chance of no cut. By the December meeting, Goldman thinks inflation numbers running at roughly 2% will lead the Fed to stop cutting.</li><li>Elsewhere, the desk will be keeping an eye on comments from James Bullard later today; the St Louis Fed President was a key indicator for the July meeting, having said he sees a 50bps cut as ‘excessive’ – the key is how his view has changed since the Fed meeting, and the ramping of trade tensions.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>WHAT HAPPENED: </strong>Following China authorities' allowing of the yuan to weaken passed 7.00 against the USD, the Treasury designated China a currency manipulator, despite only meeting one of the three criteria in the recent semi-annual report (the criteria it met is a large bi-lateral trade surplus above USD 20bln; analysts do not believe conditions of a current account surplus above 2% and large one-sided FX interventions tests have been satisfied).</li><li><strong>FX INTERVENTION:</strong> Analysts note that while China has been intervening in FX, it has done so not to depreciate its currency, but to stabilise the slide. The USDCNY's latest forray above 7.00 was, ironically, a result of the PBOC failing to intervene. However, with that said, Capital Economics has suggested that by explicitly badging and timing the renminbi’s breach through 7.00 as a response to US tariff threats, the PBOC has given credence to the idea that it is weaponizing the currency.</li><li><strong>POLITICS:</strong> The implications of the move are more political. The US Treasury must now enter negotiations with China - either directly, which seems unlikely, or through the IMF. China is unlikely to be cooperative, and the IMF estimates that the RMB is roughly in line with fundamentals, suggesting they may not be sympathetic to the US' arguments. If after one year, talks have not yielded any results and China has failed to take corrective actions, the US could impose punitive measures, although Capital Economics thinks these will not differ too much from what Trump is already doing. \"Despite the limited practical implications, the move is still likely to trigger the ire of China’s leadership and put further strain on bilateral relations,\" CapEco writes, \"With no off-ramp in sight, we continue to think that Trump will eventually place a 25% tariff on all imports from China.\" The consultancy also warns that China is likely to consider additional countermeasures, including further currency depreciation.</li><li><strong>WHAT NEXT:</strong> UBS Chief China Economist Tao Wang thinks the latest US move, together with the unexpected US tariff hike on Chinese exports on August 1 could be seen as further evidence that the US administration may not really want to reach a trade deal soon and reduce China's incentive to make additional concessions. Tao believes there is an increasing risk to a delay or cancellation of the planned trade talks in September. However, Tao continues to expect the PBoC to tightly manage USDCNY to avoid a large RMB depreciation and would not be surprised to see CNY strengthening back to below 7 again soon.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>No major surprises from the RBA overnight, but an unexpected boost from trade data revealing a wider than expected and record surplus has helped the Aussie mount a strong recovery from yesterday’s lows with additional support via a Yuan rebound (Usd/Cnh circa 7.0700 vs almost 7.1400 at one stage after a measured/capped 6.9683 Usd/Cny mid-point fix). Aud/Usd is back up near 0.6800 and Aud/Nzd has bounced even further from sub-1.0270 lows towards 1.0400, as the Kiwi also benefited from considerably better than forecast NZ jobs and wage metrics, with Nzd/Usd not far from 0.6600 compared to under 0.6500 at worst on Monday. However, the RBNZ is still seen cutting the OCR by another 25 bp tomorrow and the pair has subsequently eased drifted down to around 0.6550, while Aud/Jpy may lose momentum given mega expiry options at the 72.00 strike (4 bn).</p><p><strong>GBP/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Pound has also regained composure amidst a broad stabilisation in risk sentiment, with Cable just surpassing yesterday’s best before stalling into the 1.2200 level and Eur/Gbp reversing from 0.9250 to a few pips below 0.9200 even though no deal Brexit risk is arguably rising. Similar story for the Scandi Crowns that are paring losses vs a steady Euro and with the Nok encouraged by a partial revival in oil as well.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Conversely, the tentative and formative Tuesday turnaround in financial markets/mood has taken its toll on the Yen especially as Usd/Jpy spikes from near 105.50 lows to just over 107.00 before topping out, while the Franc has retreated against the Dollar and Euro to 0.9750+ and 1.0930 respectively compared to almost 0.9700 and 1.0900.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Aussie and Kiwi, German factory orders and the construction PMI hardly impacted the single currency even though the former was significantly better than anticipated and the latter lost grip of the 50.0 handle. Instead, Eur/Usd is anchored around 1.1200 and trading more in lock-step with wider Greenback moves as the <strong>DXY</strong> returns to its 97.500 axis within 97.698-203 parameters, plus the aforementioned Yuan fluctuations on the premise that the Euro may become the default alternative for China if trade wars escalate and US Treasuries are offloaded in response to tariffs and the official declaration that Beijing is a currency manipulator. However, expiries may also be impacting ahead of the NY cut when 1.5 bn roll off between 1.1190-1.1200.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The RBI completes this week’s global Central Bank policy meeting rota, and like the RBNZ is expected to reduce key rates by ¼ point and if confirmed it will be 4 such moves in a row. However, the BoK could make an unscheduled appearance in some shape or form before that as an emergency gathering has been convened in South Korea for 23GMT tonight to ‘discuss’ financial conditions. Usd/Inr currently hovering above 70.7300 and Usd/Krw close to 1215.50.</p>",

Indeed, even the Euro has failed to derive any traction from the big beat in industrial orders as Eur/Usd holds around 1.1200 and towards the base of its 1.1190-1.1250 range, although decent option expiry interest may be a factor here given 1.5 bn rolling off between 1.1190-1.1200. Ahead, more from Germany via the construction PMI, but speeches from Fed’s Harker and Bullard could well be more pivotal for September FOMC expectations that currently lean towards -50 bp vs -25 bp by a 2/3 majority.</p>",

This initially benefitted most the greenback’s major counterparts in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> extended above 1.1200 as some suggested the single currency is seen as the most viable option for China to park its money in the unlikely event that the trade situation worsens to the point that China triggers the nuclear option of dumping its US debt holdings, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also gained but with price action contained near the 1.2150 level and after reports that Downing Street is considering plans for UK PM Johnson to refuse resigning even if he loses a confidence vote so he can push through a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and JPY-crosses nursed the prior day’s losses despite the risk-averse tone as markets found relief from the PBoC reference rate which was weakened from the prior day but not as drastic as expected and within the 7.0000 level sticking point. Antipodeans were also underpinned post-fix with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> boosted after stellar employment and wage figures for New Zealand before wobbling on softer Inflation Expectations, and although the jobs data did little to alter forecasts for the upcoming central bank announcement with a 25bps cut by the RBNZ fully priced in for tomorrow, it did cast some doubts on the uber-dovish calls on the RBNZ such as from the likes of ANZ which sees 3 back-to-back rate cuts to 0.75% by November. <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> benefitted from a wider than expected trade surplus and in a knee-jerk reaction to the RBA decision to keep rates unchanged at the record low 1.00% following the previous back-to-back cuts, as the central bank’s tone lacked urgency for further easing despite keeping the door open for future adjustment. However, <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> then returned to pre-announcement levels as participants digested more of the statement which noted a longer time to reach 2% inflation and subdued wage growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBA kept the Cash Rate Target unchanged at 1.00% as expected and stated it is to adjust policy if needed to support the economy and will monitor developments in labour markets closely</strong>.

There was further buying in afternoon trade, after China had confirmed that state firms had stopped buys of US agriculture, and did not rule out sanctions on US ags in the future. Fed pricing has moved dovishly, with traders now seeing 111 worth of easing through the end of next year, from around 100bps of easing on Friday. A 25bps rate cut at the September meeting is priced with certainty, and there is now around 40% chance of the ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps at that meeting. Fed officials that have spoken have been quite circumspect, and hawkish George and dovish Brainard both indicated that they were monitoring the market. There are a host of other Fed officials on the slate for the week, and the desk will be paying particular attention to the dovish Bullard, who is due to speak on Tuesday; Bullard made the case ahead of the July Fed meeting that a 50bps cut was a bit too excessive.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets resumed the sell-off following Wall St’s worse performance YTD where the S&amp;P 500 posted a 6th consecutive day of losses and the DJIA dropped over 900 points intraday due to the US-China trade tensions and CNY slump, while the US designation of China as a currency manipulator added to the jitters and initially pressured US futures after-hours. ASX 200 (-2.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) traded with hefty losses and broad weakness across sectors although gold names remained the exception in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark staged a significant recovery as better than expected Household Spending data and a rebound in USD/JPY softened the blow, with earnings releases also a driver for price action. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.4%) were pressured by the trade tensions after the US labelled China a currency manipulator and after China confirmed purchases of US agriculture products have been suspended, although markets found some comfort after the PBoC announced to sell CNY 30bln of bills in Hong Kong and set the reference rate within bounds of the perceived 7.00 line in the sand. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy with early upside seen due to the wide risk averse tone which boosted prices to a fresh record high and dragged the 10yr yields to below -0.2% which was seen to be the bottom end of BoJ’s target. However, prices have since eased back with 10yr JGBs now lower as stocks recovered from lows and after a mixed 30yr auction, while T-notes have also retreated to below the 130.00 level amid a pullback from the recent surge triggered by the trade tensions which also saw the 3m/10yr yield inversion at its most prominent since the GFC.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The RBA is to announce its latest rate decision on Tuesday in which the central bank is expected to keep the Cash Rate Target at the record low of 1.00%. The expectations are heavily one-sided with nearly all 40 analysts surveyed by a major newswire forecasting the RBA to pause following its recent back-to-back cuts and 2 are calling for another 25bps cut, while ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate futures price in 90% expectations of a hold.</p><p>The wide consensus for the RBA to stand pat follows the consecutive cuts in the prior 2 policy meetings which was the first policy moves by the central bank after a near 3-year hiatus. Therefore, the central bank is seen likely to pause and assess the impact of the recent rate cuts to the economy, while it previously noted that economic forecast has assumed rates at 1.00% by year-end, where they now currently are.</p><p>In addition, RBA Governor Lowe suggested the two cuts will make an important contribution to putting the economy on a better path and winding back spare capacity, while he added that the board is prepared to adjust interest rates again if demand disappoints or if needed to get closer to full employment and achieve the inflation target, which hints at a data dependant stance. Lowe further stated that Australia's terms of trade have risen largely due to higher iron ore prices and&nbsp; they anticipate a solid upswing in the resources sector to help the overall economy, but also noted it will be sometime before inflation comfortably returns to its target and that is reasonable to expect an extended period of low interest rates.</p><p>The latest key data releases have been mixed with headline Australian CPI at 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.5% (Prev. 1.3%) and the RBA-preferred Trimmed Mean CPI at 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.5% (Prev. 1.6%), which is firmer than expected but still below the RBA's 2%-3% target. Conversely, Employment Change for June disappointed at 0.5k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 42.3k) although showed an improvement in the type of employment with 21.1k Full Time jobs added, while the Unemployment Rate remained at 5.2% which was as expected but above the 4.5% level touted to be consistent with inflation goals. These varied releases therefore suggest a lack of urgency for additional policy easing and that it would be prudent to adopt a wait and see approach, although further rate adjustments cannot be fully dismissed given the higher than preferred jobless numbers.</p><p>The rate announcement is scheduled for 0530BST/2330CDT/1230HKT where focus will be on the rate decision, then followed by the statement for any clues of future policy action as a surprise rate cut or any comments that support current market expectations for another 25bps cut in October is likely to weigh on AUD, while a lack thereof could unwind some of the dovish bets and underpin the currency.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Capital Economics suggests negative rates are possible in Australia if other measures fail to restore growth and move inflation towards target.</li><li>CBA views recent inflation data will provide the RBA time to assess its past rate cuts.</li><li>Westpac forecasts RBA to lower rates to 0.75% in October and then to 0.50% in February.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets resume the sell-off following Wall St’s worse performance YTD where the S&amp;P 500 posted a 6th consecutive day of losses and the DJIA dropped over 900 points intraday due to the US-China trade tensions and CNY slump, while the US designation of China as a currency manipulator added to the jitters and further weighed on US futures after-hours. ASX 200 (-2.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.0%) trade with hefty losses and broad weakness across sectors although gold names remain the exception in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark is off worse levels as better than expected Household Spending data and a rebound in USD/JPY somewhat softens the blow, with earnings releases also a driver for price action. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.6%) are pressured by the trade tensions after the US labelled China a currency manipulator and after China confirmed purchases of US agriculture products have been suspended, but with markets finding some brief comfort after the PBoC announced to sell CNY 30bln of bills in Hong Kong and set the reference rate within bounds of the perceived 7.0000 line in the sand.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY weakened and CNH posted a fresh record low just shy of the 7.1400 handle against the USD after a further escalation of tensions due to the currency manipulator announcement on China. This benefitted most the greenback’s major counterparts with EUR/USD extending above 1.1200 as some suggested the single currency is seen as the most viable option for China to park its money in the unlikely event that the trade situation worsens to the point that China triggers the nuclear option of dumping its US debt holdings, while GBP/USD also gained but with price action contained near the 1.2150 level and after reports that Downing Street are considering plans for UK PM Johnson to refuse resigning even if he lost a confidence vote so he can push through a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses nursed the prior day’s losses despite the risk-averse tone as markets found some relief from the PBoC reference rate which was weakened from the prior day but not as drastic as expected and within the 7.0000 level sticking point. Antipodeans were also underpinned post-fix and after encouraging data including a wider than expected trade surplus for Australia, as well as stellar employment and wage figures for New Zealand, and although this did little to alter expectations for the upcoming central bank announcements with RBA expected to maintain rates later at 1.00% and with a 25bps cut by the RBNZ fully priced in for tomorrow, it did cast some doubts on the uber-dovish calls on the RBNZ such as from the likes of ANZ which sees 3 back-to-back rate cuts to 0.75% by November.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy with initial upside seen due to the wide risk averse tone which boosted prices to a fresh record high and dragged the 10yr yields to below -0.2% which was seen to be the bottom end of BoJ’s target. However, prices have since eased back with 10yr JGBs now flat ahead of a 30yr auction, while T-notes have pulled back below the 130.00 level but remain firmer after its recent surge triggered by the trade tensions which also saw the 3m/10yr yield inversion at its most prominent since the GFC.</p>",
