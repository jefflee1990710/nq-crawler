(AAPL) and Foxconn (2354 TT) reportedly violated a Chinese labour rule by having around a 50% temporary workforce in a Chinese plant, which is in contravention of Chinese Labour law which sets a maximum limit of 10%. AT&amp;T Inc. (T) traded higher after it received a letter from Elliot Management recommending the company to divest its non-core assets in a value creation method which will give the name a USD 60/shr value by 2021. AT&amp;T (T) however later reportedly hired Goldman Sachs to defend against the activist. Further, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson, came under fire from the activists over some ‘questionable M&amp;A decisions’ as they call for a leadership reshuffle. Elsewhere, Netflix (NFLX) was boosted after Bank of America said it sees significant reacceleration in Q3, with downloads tracking 30% higher. Eli Lilly (LLY) presented data from its LOXO-292 clinical trial which saw tumours shrink in 68% of advanced lung cancer patients whose tumours carried specific abnormalities in the RET gene. Alibaba’s (BABA) CEO, Jack Ma, announced he is to step down on Tuesday. Nissan (NSANY) CEO also announced his resignation after he recently admitted to being overpaid, his resignation is to become effective on September 16th. In broker moves, Energiser (ENR) &amp; Nutanix (NTNX) were double upgraded at Bank of America and Susquehanna, and Fox (FOXA) were downgraded to underperform from neutral at Macquarie, and HP Inc.

S&amp;P 500 0% at 2978, NASDAQ-100 -0.3% at 7832, Dow Jones 0.2% at 26836.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened, taking its cues from the Bund in afternoon trade. Some desks had cited a more constructive risk tone in early trade for the rise in yields, with fewer concerns on the US/China trade front, while the notion of central bank easing was also being attributed (which is difficult to buy, given one usually expects yields to fall on the latter). The US Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wednesday), and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Thursday); UBS notes that that there will be around USD 26bln of cashflows (ex-SOMA) this week, including USD 24bln of redemptions and USD 2bln of coupons. Analysts at BMO say that this week's supply could offer a further concessionary impulse as September's 3s/10s/30s auctions are the final primary market coupon opportunity before the Fed once again (very likely) lowers policy. US T-note (U9) settled 16+ ticks lower at 130-27+.</p>",

An afternoon sell-off was not attributed to any specific news, but desks had noted that the moves lower were led by momentum names coming under pressure. Some also suggested there was a rotation from large cap to smaller caps, as the RUT remained resilient; some newswires attributed the softness to questions whether likely upcoming stimulus measures from global central banks would be successful in staving off a growth slowdown. Gold came under pressure on Monday, as negative real rates pared, and the US 10-year yield found its way above 1.6%, seeing the yellow metal find lows sub USD 1500. Meanwhile, the US Treasury curve bear-steepened, taking cues from the Bund, where downside was exacerbated after a report suggesting the Germans were looking at other ways to issue debt for infrastructure and green projects; the EUR also gained on the news. The dollar is lower on the day. Oil was firmer after a new energy minister was appointed in Saudi Arabia, who remains committed to the OPEC supply curb pact. The market's attention is focussed on Thursday's ECB meeting, as well as US CPI and retail sales towards the end of the week.</p><p><strong>* MNUCHIN:</strong> In a broad interview, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he did not see a US recession. He said that the US will consider further tax cuts next year. On China, Mnuchin said that he would discuss the yuan level with PBOC governor Yi Gang in the next round of talks. And on geopolitics, Mnuchin said that the US is still mulling sanctions on Turkey after its purchase of Russian S-400 missile system.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY FISCAL STIMULUS:</strong> Germany is considering the creation of a shadow budget that would enable Berlin to boost public investment beyond the restrictions of constitutionally enshrined debt rules, Reuters reported citing three sources familiar with discussions. The measure would involve setting up independent public entities that would capitalise on historically low yields to raise debt to invest in infrastructure and climate protection. The debt would not be accounted for under Germany's strict fiscal rules, instead, it would be under the more lenient rules of the EU's stability and growth pact. Some German lawmakers have been examining measures to boost fiscal spending amid the growth slowdown. In reaction to the news, Bunds saw downside, while the EUR rose. Elsewhere, Germany could reportedly face a shortfall in tax revenue in 2020/21, according to Handelsblatt.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Foreign Minister Raab on the weekend said that the UK government would abide by Parliamentary legislation blocking a no deal Brexit, but would look to test it legally, perhaps in court, and raised the possibility of a non-governmental body bringing a court case to test the legislation. PM Johnson himself on Monday said he would abide by the Brexit law if forced to do so by courts. The Telegraph newspaper has reported that the government has plans to circumvent the Brexit legislation, by requesting an extension (per the legislation) but sending an accompanying letter expressing that the government does not support a delay. Over the weekend, the French Foreign Minister questioned the logic of another Brexit extension, adding that the EU did not want to give extensions every three months. This sentiment, however, is not universal, BBC's Katya Adler reported, stating that the common EU assumption is that the bloc would say yes to a UK extension request. An election now seems inevitable (MPs will likely vote again this evening, and although the expectation is that the government will lose again, it seems only a matter of time now before Brits go to the polls); accordingly, sensitivities around the timing of the election are easing, leaving the focus on how Parliament will look, post election. Polls continue to indicate the Tories hold a lead over Labour, however, when you merge parties into 'leave' and 'remain' groups, the situation is more balanced. Elsewhere, House Speaker Bercow said he will stand down as both a speaker and an MP at the next election, or on 31st October, whichever came first.</p><p><strong>* UK JULY GDP:</strong> GDP rose by 0.3% M/M in July, ahead of the consensus 0.1%, helping the 3m/3m measure to go flat from -0.2% in June. Services did the heavy lifting, where there was broad-based strength. The +0.3% in manufacturing may be a result of Brexit stockpiling, analysts said, though it only contributed to 0.03ppts of GDP growth. Pantheon's analysts said the data could signal growth of 0.4% in Q3; \"With little spare capacity left in the economy, a fiscal boost coming &nbsp;and CPI inflation set to exceed the 2% target from the second half of 2020 onwards, we continue to think that markets are wrong to price-in a greater-than 50% chance of the MPC cutting Bank Rate over the next six months.\"</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BoE's Vlieghe said structural forces, which were unrelated to monetary policy, are unlikely to keep interest rates low. Vlieghe said BoE analysis rules out taking rates negative, and that the BOE was unlikely to be able to cut rates as it did in the previous downturn. He argued that more QE was unlikely to provide much stimulus, since there is not much room for UK Gilt yields to fall further.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 1.33 HIGHER AT USD 57.85/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES USD 1.05 HIGHER AT USD 62.59/BBL.</strong> Saudi Arabia has vowed that it would continue to support OPEC+ oil output cuts under new energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. Oil markets welcomed the new minister, despite his predecessor being respected in the market, and playing an instrumental role in engineering the supply cut deal. Analysts said it may be a reflection that the market is seeing the move as a sign of concern in Saudi Arabia that oil prices are holding at levels below Saudi's fiscal breakeven price. UBS said Saudi energy policy is already aimed at pushing oil prices higher, with production and export cuts that go well beyond commitments as part of the OPEC+ agreement, but the bank says that \"we may see a shift in both messaging about Saudi’s goals and about the relatively relaxed stance Saudi has taken towards compliance by other OPEC+ participants. This week’s OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee is not a forum that would usually be much cause for excitement, but may turn out to be an early opportunity to gauge whether Saudi policy or messaging will be affected by the appointment of the new Energy Minister.\" Elsewhere, the US DOE awarded contracts for nearly 9.88mln barrels of SPR crude to four US companies, with deliveries to take place in October and November; no dollar amounts were stated.</p><p><strong>* PBOC MIXED SIGNALS:</strong> Last week's RRR cut, accompanied by a targeted rate cut, was considered aggressive - it was the first time since 2015 that the central bank announced both on the same day. Analysts said it sent an easing signal, especially since the long-term liquidity injected would not be used to replace maturing MLF. However, on Monday, the PBOC skipped MLF rollover this morning, effectively replacing the 1-year MLF with shorter-term 7-day reverse repos, which is more of a&nbsp;hawkish signal than was sent out last week. UBS says that, by doing this, the PBOC is taking back control of interbank market liquidity in the medium-term and is ensuring that it can withdraw liquidity whenever it deems appropriate. UBS reasons that it is possible that an immediate MLF cut after RRR cut would be too strong a signal when China wants to control the pace of Yuan depreciation, and the bank suggests keeping an eye on the MLFs that mature next week.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> A softer dollar -- partly inspired by a stronger EUR on hopes of German stimulus -- did not result in a haven bid, with the JPY, CHF and even XAU off (the latter quite notably, as US yields rise). The offshore yuan traded higher despite DXY downside, which some had suggested was putting pressure on EMFX, with the exception of ZAR, which newswires had suggested was a result of 'Fed rate cut bets spurring buying'. Sterling has firmed as no deal Brexit risks are slowly taken off the table, but traders are still cognizant of measures the Johnson government might attempt to drive through a no deal. CAD continued on last week's upside, helped along by higher oil prices. The RUB was also higher on oil. The antipodes were higher, again with hopes of stimulus being cited.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (U9) SETTLE 16+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-27+.</strong> The Treasury curve bear-steepened, taking its cues from the Bund in afternoon trade. Some desks had cited a more constructive risk tone in early trade for the rise in yields, with fewer concerns on the US/China trade front, while the notion of central bank easing was also being attributed (which is difficult to buy, given one usually expects yields to fall on the latter). The US Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wednesday), and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Thursday); UBS notes that that there will be around USD 26bln of cashflows (ex-SOMA) this week, including USD 24bln of redemptions and USD 2bln of coupons. Analysts at BMO say that this week's supply could offer a further concessionary impulse as September's 3s/10s/30s auctions are the final primary market coupon opportunity before the Fed once again (very likely) lowers policy rates.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 0% at 2978, NASDAQ-100 -0.3% at 7832, Dow Jones 0.2% at 26836</strong></p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.3%, Consumer Staples -0.3%, Energy 1.9%, Financials 1.5%, Health Care -0.9%, Industrials 0.3%, Information Technology -0.7%, Materials -0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.2%, Utilities -0.6%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Foxconn (2354 TT) reportedly violated a Chinese labour rule by having around a 50% temporary workforce in a Chinese plant, which is in contravention of Chinese Labour law which sets a maximum limit of 10%. AT&amp;T Inc. (T) traded higher after it received a letter from Elliot Management recommending the company to divest its non-core assets in a value creation method which will give the name a USD 60/shr value by 2021. AT&amp;T (T) however later reportedly hired Goldman Sachs to defend against the activist. Further, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson, came under fire from the activists over some ‘questionable M&amp;A decisions’ as they call for a leadership reshuffle. Elsewhere, Netflix (NFLX) was boosted after Bank of America said it sees significant reacceleration in Q3, with downloads tracking 30% higher. Eli Lilly (LLY) presented data from its LOXO-292 clinical trial which saw tumours shrink in 68% of advanced lung cancer patients whose tumours carried specific abnormalities in the RET gene. Alibaba’s (BABA) CEO, Jack Ma, announced he is to step down on Tuesday. Nissan (NSANY) CEO also announced his resignation after he recently admitted to being overpaid, his resignation is to become effective on September 16th. In broker moves, Energiser (ENR) &amp; Nutanix (NTNX) were double upgraded at Bank of America and Susquehanna, and Fox (FOXA) were downgraded to underperform from neutral at Macquarie, and HP Inc. (HPQ) downgraded to market perform from outperform at Bernstein.</p>",

Oil markets welcomed the new minister, despite his predecessor being respected in the market, and playing an instrumental role in engineering the supply cut deal. Analysts said it may be a reflection that the market is seeing the move as a sign of concern in Saudi Arabia that oil prices are holding at levels below Saudi's fiscal breakeven price. UBS said Saudi energy policy is already aimed at pushing oil prices higher, with production and export cuts that go well beyond commitments as part of the OPEC+ agreement, but the bank says that \"we may see a shift in both messaging about Saudi’s goals and about the relatively relaxed stance Saudi has taken towards compliance by other OPEC+ participants. This week’s OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee is not a forum that would usually be much cause for excitement, but may turn out to be an early opportunity to gauge whether Saudi policy or messaging will be affected by the appointment of the new Energy Minister.\" Elsewhere, the US DOE awareded contracts for nearly 9.88mln barrels of SPR crude to four US companies, with deliveries to take place in October and November; no dollar amounts were stated. &nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound is off best levels, but still well ahead of the chasing G10 pack after a run of considerably better than expected UK data, including July GDP, industrial production, output and trade, plus positive sounding comments from PM Johnson at the start of his meeting with Irish counterpart Varadkar. Meanwhile, the former’s 2nd attempt to force an election is widely expected to fall short again and the Queen has now given her seal of approval to the anti-no deal Brexit/extension bill, reducing the prospect of a cliff edge scenario. Cable extended gains to just shy of the 1.2385 July 29 high and stops said to be sitting on a break and Eur/Gbp got to within a handful of pips from 0.8900 and not much further from a key Fib retracement level/support just under the big figure at 0.8892. However, as Sterling stalled/waned with House speaker Bercow announcing that he would stand down on October 31 if Parliament does not back an election, the single currency got a boost from a firmer rebound in Bund/Eurozone bond yields following reports that Germany could use a ‘shadow budget’ to get round stringent and self-imposed debt rules to boost public spending. Indeed, Eur/Usd broke out of its earlier constricted range, but eased back below 1 bn 1.1050 option expiries ahead of the NY cut before probing higher again shortly afterwards. So far, the headline pair has reached 1.1064, very close to resistance at 1.1065 and then a Fib at 1.1088, while the cross is back up near 0.8950.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie is still revelling in more neutral/balanced RBA guidance, constructive US-China trade developments and the PBoC latest RRR reductions, with Aud/Usd up to 0.6875 and further outpacing the Kiwi that lost altitude vs its US peer on the way to 0.6450 and faded against its Antipodean rival above 1.0650. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Krona got a double boost from strong GDP data and a strengthening rebound in crude prices, as Eur/Nok continued its retreat from recent peaks (around 10.0000) to almost 9.8500 at one stage, and the Loonie also derived traction from oil to eclipse technical support at 1.3156 and 1.3150 before waning.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/XAU&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although risk assets were not uniformly bid or in demand, the traditional safe-havens underperformed with the Yen gradually weakening through 107.00, Franc back below 0.9900 and Gold slipping back under Usd1500/oz as the <strong>DXY </strong>held above 98.000 and Fib support (98.034), albeit towards the middle of a 98.167-512 range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The aforementioned bounce in crude undermined the Try alongside ongoing expectations and external pressure on the CBRT to slash rates this week, but the Lira was also jittery after remarks from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin about S-400 sanctions that are still under consideration. Usd/Try rallied beyond 5.7600 before paring back a bit, while in contrast Usd/Rub and Usd/Zar both maintained their downward trajectories to circa 65.3600 and 14.6700 respectively.</p>",

Unsurprisingly, sectors are painting a similar picture this morning though the energy sector outperforms amidst strength in the broader complex. In terms of individual movers, ProSiebensat (+5.5%) lead the Stoxx 600 after being upgraded to buy at UBS and the Co. stating they are to remain focused on their free-to-air business. At the other end of the spectrum are ThyssenKrupp (-2.3%) after the Co’s CEO states he would prefer a minority stake sale in their elevator division which has the potential to be valued at over EUR 15bln. Elsewhere, Lloyds (-0.4%) are slightly subdued after suspending their GBP 1.75bln share buyback scheme due to a substantial inflow of PPI claims, as such the Co. need to make an incremental charge of GBP 1.2-1.8bln on top of their prior Q3 provisions.</p><p><strong>AAPLE (AAPL)</strong> &amp; Foxconn (2354 TT) – Apple and Foxconn have reportedly violated a Chinese labour rule through the use of around 50% temporary workforce in a Chinese plant in August, which is in violation of Chinese Labour law which sets a maximum limit of 10%. (Newswires/China Labour Watch)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> Sterling survived and bout of selling pressure that pushed Cable down through 1.2250 and Eur/Gbp up above 0.9000, but was already recouping and reversing gains before a raft of UK releases that beat expectations across the board. This raised eyebrows and speculation about some being privy to the numbers or nature of the data beforehand, but others also pointed to the fact that the bill ensuring another Brexit extension rather than now deal is due to receive Royal Assent later today and reports that PM Johnson may have conceded that he may have to accept another 3 months if he fails to strike an accord with the EU before October 31. Meanwhile, opening remarks from his meeting with Irish PM Varadkar were largely upbeat and confident on the subject of resolving the Irish border backstop, including alternatives to the current WA proposal as he claimed there are many prospective options, but not for public consumption. In response and/or follow-through from the aforementioned encouraging data, Cable cleared 1.2300 more convincingly on its way over the 55 DMA (1.2328) and above last Friday’s post-NFP high (1.2338) to circa 1.2360, while Eur/Gbp reversed through the big figure and 0.8950, eyeing 0.8900 next.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/CAD -</strong> The Antipodean Dollars have extended recovery gains vs their US counterpart in wake of the latest PBoC RRR cuts, a sub-forecast rise in US payrolls and despite Chinese trade data revealing an unexpected decline in exports. Aud/Usd has now advanced towards 0.6870 and Nzd/Usd is approaching 0.6450 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0650. Elsewhere, strong Norwegian GDP for the month of July and firm oil prices are underpinning the Nok as it rebounds through 9.9000 vs a steady Eur overall, while the Cad is inching closer to resistance ahead of 1.3150 against its US rival on the back of Canada’s labour report and a bumper jump in the jobs tally.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY -</strong> Both narrowly mixed vs the Greenback around 1.1025 and 107.00 respectively, and well flanked by heavy option expiry interest as 1.8 bn rolls off at 1.1000 and 1 bn at 1.1050 in Eur/Usd, while 1.5 bn, 1.3 bn and 1.3 bn are layered in Usd/Jpy from 106.50-60, through 106.85-95 to 107.25-30. Note also, the Euro and Yen are not deriving much from the Buck indirectly as the DXY trades within a tight 98.512-309 band.</p><p><strong>CHF -</strong> The G10 laggard as the Franc retreats from its post-NFP peaks towards 0.9900 again and Eur/Chf climbs towards the top of a 1.0930-1.0890 range amidst firmer risk sentiment overall and expectations that the SNB will respond to likely stimulus from the ECB this week and Fed next week at its September Quarterly Policy review.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Lira continues to underperform or hand back recovery gains following more dovish prompting from Turkish President Erdogan ahead of this month’s CBRT policy convene where forecasts range from 225-275 bp worth of easing after the significantly bigger than anticipated -425 bp in July. Usd/Try is back above 5.7300 in contrast to Usd/Zar that is now under 14.7500 irrespective of more warnings from the ratings agencies about aid for SA’s power company Eskom and S&amp;P advising caution when restructuring the firm’s bonds.</p><p>Notable Option Expiries:</p><p>- EUR/USD: <strong>1.1000 (1.8BLN),</strong> 1.1025 (730M), <strong>1.1050 (1BLN)</strong></p><p>- USD/JPY: <strong>106.50-60 (1.5BLN), 106.85-95 (1.3BLN), 107.25-30 (1.3BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Bonds have broken lower again, albeit not in a straight line or perhaps due to more post-data/survey selling in a belated fashion, despite the UK beats and a bigger than forecast bounce in the Eurozone Sentix index. Instead, it appears that rising Brexit deal prospects/declining cliff edge risk have weighed heavier on Gilts and propelled Sterling to fresh recent peaks, with the 10 year benchmark just off a fresh 133.29 Liffe low, Bunds down to 174.59 at worst and US Treasuries crossing 131-00/1.60% in benchmark yield terms. Ahead, the next instalments from Westminster and a pretty barren US slate with only consumer credit scheduled.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent and WTI prices are firmer this morning, </strong>with both WTI and Brent having successfully surpassed the USD 57.00/bbl and USD 62.00/bbl marks at best thus far. Nothing too fresh in the way of fundamental news flow this morning, but weekend reports showed that Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih has been replaced by Prince Abdulaziz; PVM indicate that no changed is to be expected in the current strategy of OPEC and if anything this may strengthen their resolve to balance markets. Other energy minister comments from Secretary General Barkindo that the JMMC could debate potential new production targets, meeting is scheduled for September 12th. The complex may have derived some support this morning from renewed geopolitical tensions via Iran, who have told the IAEA that they intend to produce enriched uranium with advanced centrifuges and as such would breach the nuclear deals imposed ban. Although, gold has failed to generate too much in the way of support from these comments with the yellow metal little changed on the day and still holding above the USD 1500/oz mark going into a critical week for markets courtesy of the ECB on Thursday. Separately, China’s Iron imports increased 6% YY to their highest since January 2018, which ING note is due to increasing shipments from Australia and amidst a recovery in Brazilian exports.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia removed Energy Minister Al-Falih from position and replaced him with Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud</strong>.

Unsurprisingly, sectors are painting a similar picture this morning though the energy sector outperforms amidst strength in the broader complex. In terms of individual movers, ProSiebensat (+5.5%) lead the Stoxx 600 after being upgraded to buy at UBS and the Co. stating they are to remain focused on their free-to-air business. At the other end of the spectrum are ThyssenKrupp (-2.3%) after the Co’s CEO states he would prefer a minority stake sale in their elevator division which has the potential to be valued at over EUR 15bln. Elsewhere, Lloyds (-0.4%) are slightly subdued after suspending their GBP 1.75bln share buyback scheme due to a substantial inflow of PPI claims, as such the Co. need to make an incremental charge of GBP 1.2-1.8bln on top of their prior Q3 provisions.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> Sterling survived and bout of selling pressure that pushed Cable down through 1.2250 and Eur/Gbp up above 0.9000, but was already recouping and reversing gains before a raft of UK releases that beat expectations across the board. This raised eyebrows and speculation about some being privy to the numbers or nature of the data beforehand, but others also pointed to the fact that the bill ensuring another Brexit extension rather than now deal is due to receive Royal Assent later today and reports that PM Johnson may have conceded that he may have to accept another 3 months if he fails to strike an accord with the EU before October 31. Meanwhile, opening remarks from his meeting with Irish PM Varadkar were largely upbeat and confident on the subject of resolving the Irish border backstop, including alternatives to the current WA proposal as he claimed there are many prospective options, but not for public consumption. In response and/or follow-through from the aforementioned encouraging data, Cable cleared 1.2300 more convincingly on its way over the 55 DMA (1.2328) and above last Friday’s post-NFP high (1.2338) to circa 1.2360, while Eur/Gbp reversed through the big figure and 0.8950, eyeing 0.8900 next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/CAD -</strong> The Antipodean Dollars have extended recovery gains vs their US counterpart in wake of the latest PBoC RRR cuts, a sub-forecast rise in US payrolls and despite Chinese trade data revealing an unexpected decline in exports. Aud/Usd has now advanced towards 0.6870 and Nzd/Usd is approaching 0.6450 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0650. Elsewhere, strong Norwegian GDP for the month of July and firm oil prices are underpinning the Nok as it rebounds through 9.9000 vs a steady Eur overall, while the Cad is inching closer to resistance ahead of 1.3150 against its US rival on the back of Canada’s labour report and a bumper jump in the jobs tally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY -</strong> Both narrowly mixed vs the Greenback around 1.1025 and 107.00 respectively, and well flanked by heavy option expiry interest as 1.8 bn rolls off at 1.1000 and 1 bn at 1.1050 in Eur/Usd, while 1.5 bn, 1.3 bn and 1.3 bn are layered in Usd/Jpy from 106.50-60, through 106.85-95 to 107.25-30. Note also, the Euro and Yen are not deriving much from the Buck indirectly as the DXY trades within a tight 98.512-309 band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF -</strong> The G10 laggard as the Franc retreats from its post-NFP peaks towards 0.9900 again and Eur/Chf climbs towards the top of a 1.0930-1.0890 range amidst firmer risk sentiment overall and expectations that the SNB will respond to likely stimulus from the ECB this week and Fed next week at its September Quarterly Policy review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Lira continues to underperform or hand back recovery gains following more dovish prompting from Turkish President Erdogan ahead of this month’s CBRT policy convene where forecasts range from 225-275 bp worth of easing after the significantly bigger than anticipated -425 bp in July. Usd/Try is back above 5.7300 in contrast to Usd/Zar that is now under 14.7500 irrespective of more warnings from the ratings agencies about aid for SA’s power company Eskom and S&amp;P advising caution when restructuring the firm’s bonds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bonds have broken lower again, albeit not in a straight line or perhaps due to more post-data/survey selling in a belated fashion, despite the UK beats and a bigger than forecast bounce in the Eurozone Sentix index. Instead, it appears that rising Brexit deal prospects/declining cliff edge risk have weighed heavier on Gilts and propelled Sterling to fresh recent peaks, with the 10 year benchmark just off a fresh 133.29 Liffe low, Bunds down to 174.59 at worst and US Treasuries crossing 131-00/1.60% in benchmark yield terms. Ahead, the next instalments from Westminster and a pretty barren US slate with only consumer credit scheduled.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent and WTI</strong> prices are firmer this morning, with both WTI and Brent having successfully surpassed the USD 57.00/bbl and USD 62.00/bbl marks at best thus far. Nothing too fresh in the way of fundamental news flow this morning, but weekend reports showed that Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih has been replaced by Prince Abdulaziz; PVM indicate that no changed is to be expected in the current strategy of OPEC and if anything this may strengthen their resolve to balance markets. Other energy minister comments from Secretary General Barkindo that the JMMC could debate potential new production targets, meeting is scheduled for September 12th. The complex may have derived some support this morning from renewed geopolitical tensions via Iran, who have told the IAEA that they intend to produce enriched uranium with advanced centrifuges and as such would breach the nuclear deals imposed ban. Although<strong>, gold</strong> has failed to generate too much in the way of support from these comments with the yellow metal little changed on the day and still holding above the USD 1500/oz mark going into a critical week for markets courtesy of the ECB on Thursday. Separately, China’s <strong>Iron imports</strong> increased 6% YY to their highest since January 2018, which ING note is due to increasing shipments from Australia and amidst a recovery in Brazilian exports.</p>",

        "content": "<p>ING have revised lower their forecast for EUR/USD; they see the cross moving into a 1.05-1.10 for the remainder of year. The bank cites four main reasons behind the revision in its forecast:</p><p><strong>1) Further deterioration&nbsp;in the US-China trade war</strong> – ING, amongst a number of other desks, foresee a further deterioration in trade tensions between the US and China, despite recent positive rhetoric, as China stands firm in its rejection of some of the US’ key demands. There is also the risk that the US may impose sanctions on EU exports, the bank reminds us, as made clear over the weekend by reports that despite the agreement at the G7, the US is still mulling taxing imports of French Wine. ING expect such risks to dissuade investor from entering strategic long positions.</p><p><strong>2) The bar is high for a “dovish” Fed surprise –</strong> There is already very&nbsp;aggressive market expectations of&nbsp;Fed easing, making it hard for the Fed to 'surprise', ING argues. The bank argues that for dovish expectations to be exceeded, the Fed would have to embark on an aggressive easing cycle, which they argue is unlikely given the strength of the consumer (as evidenced by recent retail sales prints). Although a further slowdown in global growth could also spur more aggressive Fed rate cuts, it would likely be accompanied by further easing by other global central banks (as we are seeing at the moment), maintaining the dollars favourable carry.</p><p><strong>3) EUR/USD no longer has a stretched valuation – </strong>Based on the bank’s model, EUR/USD BEER fair value declined due to an improvement in the US terms of trade (one of the key explanatory variables in the model). “With EUR/USD no longer stretched, this means that the pair has scope to decline even further before hitting the valuation limits” says ING.</p><p><strong>4) Speculative EUR shorts are not excessive – </strong>ING note that speculative positioning is currently not stretched, at 8% of open interest versus an average 30% between mid-2014 and end-2016. “This means that more EUR shorts can still be built and positioning does not act as a limiting factor behind the EUR/USD fall” the banks says.</p><p>A side note on this week’s ECB meeting:</p><p>While a disappointment from the ECB meeting this week could push EUR/USD higher, ING would expect such EUR strength to be temporary, as a lack of stimulus would likely increase market concern about the eurozone's economic outlook and lead to a further deterioration in growth and inflation expectations. This, the bank argues, could lead to an even bigger need for subsequent easing and, as such, a potential EUR/USD rebound this week should be seen as an attractive entry point for preparing for lower EUR/USD levels later this year.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/8a422518-3fd5-4c4a-ac86-8650dd127819.jpg\"></figure>",

As such, focus on these comments will be if any new proposals are offered and if this ‘common ground’ equates to a fundamental change in the narrative</li><li>In terms of the prorogation, consensus is now that this cannot be stopped legally though September 11th should see a ruling from the Scottish civil court on whether this is legal. Although, if today goes to the governments plan it is unclear as to how much of an effect such a ruling would have.</li><li>Regarding the Benn bill which, in essence, would compel Johnson to seek a further extension from the EU, and then accept one if this is offered. The bill is due to receive Royal assent today at which point it will formally be written into UK law. In-spite of this, PM Johnson continues to reiterate his stance that we must leave by October 31st and is reportedly to draw up plans to legally sabotage a Brexit extension; although, further reports indicate that Johnson would have to accept such a delay if it is forced on him by the legal system.</li><li>Finally, today’s SO24 emergency bills are designed to force the Government to publish no-deal planning documentation alongside an emergency debate on PM Johnson adhering to the law. This specifically refers to the prorogation advice the government have taken and any further details to the Yellowhammer documents. And the debate on the PM adhering to the law is likely aimed at defining the legal ramifications and what Parliament can do in the event that Johnson chooses to defy the Benn bill and as such break the law.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was steady amid similar flat trade in the greenback and <strong>copper</strong> prices also traded lacklustre amid early weakness in Chinese commodity prices after weaker than expected Chinese trade data.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia removed Energy Minister Al-Falih from position and replaced him with Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud</strong>.

Overnight, the bias was to the downside, as geopolitical and trade related news flow became more constructive. The complex ticked higher in wake of a disappointing NFP headline, however, although there were some gyrations as traders' digested the data in wake of the release, which did show wage growth was solid. However, the T-Note came off highs after remarks from Fed chair Powell, who seemed upbeat on the economy, and signalled no concerns that could justify a 50bps rate cut at the 18th September FOMC. The market is still priced for 25bps. The Fed now enters blackout period, with attention on the central bank front moving towards Thursday's ECB, where a package of stimulus is expected to be unveiled, and will likely see T-Notes taking cues from Bunds. US T-note futures settled 2+ ticks higher at 131-12.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell said the Fed will act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion when asked if the Fed will provide accommodation</strong>, while he added the Fed is watching all developments, geopolitical risks and financial conditions. Powell also commented that the labour market is in a good place and the labour market report is consistent with that story, while <strong>he reiterated the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the expansion. </strong>Powell added the economy is in the longest expansion since records began and the outlook is still favourable but noted risks to the outlook include slowing global growth and low inflation, while he cited trade tensions and Brexit as factors dampening global growth.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive but with gains relatively mild as the region digests the latest developments from the world’s 2 largest economies including the PBoC RRR cut announcement, mostly weaker than expected Chinese trade data and US NFP miss. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is choppy as upside in tech is counterbalanced by continued weakness in gold miners and after soft Chinese trade data which showed a surprise drop in Exports, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) remains afloat after Final GDP figures for Q2 printed inline with estimates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) are mixed as the mainland reacts to the PBoC’s 50bps RRR cut and further targeted 100bps reduction for qualified banks which is expected to release CNY 900bln of liquidity, although advances are limited by the weak trade figures and with Hong Kong dampened after further violent protests over the weekend.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady despite the recent miss in US Non-Farm Payrolls, as the data was not deemed too drastic to warrant a 50bps cut next week, while stronger than expected wage growth and upbeat comments by Fed Chair Powell on the economy also suggested a lack of urgency for a more aggressive move by the Fed. EUR/USD is rangebound near Friday’s lows at the 1.1000 handle and GBP/USD is tentative below 1.2300 as participants look ahead to another attempt by the government to push through a general election in parliament today. Furthermore, UK PM Johnson is said to draw up a plan to legally sabotage a Brexit extension if MPs vote against holding a general election, although he was reported to have signalled to cabinet ministers the government would have to accept a 3-month Brexit delay if it is forced on him by the courts and his cabinet suffered another high-profile resignation in which Works and Pensions Secretary Rudd quit due to Brexit inaction and suggested that PM Johnson was aiming for a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is relatively unchanged and antipodeans conform to the archetypal post-NFP lull as the effects of a firmer than expected CNY reference rate is offset by the weak Chinese trade data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher despite the mostly positive risk tone to reclaim the 155.00 level, while focus now shifts to the enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs later.</p>",
