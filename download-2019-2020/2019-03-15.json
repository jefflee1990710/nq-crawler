        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 15 March 2019: Stocks ignore weak manufacturing data to close higher, trade optimism cited",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities up, dollar down, Treasuries up, crude down.</strong></p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: China eases foreign investment regulation; disappointing US manufacturing data, but positive UoM consumer sentiment; IEA monthly report</strong></p><p><strong>* NEXT WEEK: FOMC, BOE, NB, SNB, BCB, PMIs, UK activity data, Germany ZEW, CAD CPI.</strong></p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING: </strong>It was a miss for both the Empire Manufacturing survey, as well as the Manufacturing/IP data. Starting with the former, which heavily slipped to 3.7 from 8.8 (against a consensus 10.0). Pantheon's analysts said \"the consensus forecast for an increase in the index was something of a head-scratcher, given the intense downward pressure on global manufacturing from China's sharp slowdown.\" The internals were mixed, with orders and shipments both falling, though employment put in a healthy rise. Pantheon noted that the data can be volatile, and a reversal next month might be a good bet. \"China's PMI suggests that the Empire State index has further to fall over the next few months, but we expect something of a rebound from mid-year,\" adding \"we reckon that the March Empire State numbers are consistent with a small increase in the national ISM manufacturing index.\" The manufacturing data was just as grim, falling for a second straight month, with autos dragging the most in both Jan and Feb. \"In other words, a broad-based softening is underway, and we're sticking to our view that the sector will be in recession through mid-year,\" Pantheon said, pointing out that manufacturing accounts for only 12% of GDP, \"so a short and relatively mild downturn in the sector is not going to pull the rest of the economy into the mire, but it will be a constraint on overall growth in both GDP and employment.\" The consultancy adds that headline industrial production rose in February due to the weather-related jump in utility output, \"but this tells us nothing about the underlying state of the industrial economy: we are much more interested in the second straight decline in the value of business equipment production, which now points clearly to a clear dip, of about 2%, in the equipment investment component of Q1 GDP,\" and says that would be quite a turnaround from Q4, when spending rose at a 6.7% rate.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Overnight, Chinese lawmakers approved a new law on foreign investment, which replaces the existing rules regarding JVs and wholly owned foreign enterprises. UBS explains that \"the rules are designed to ease foreign concerns about China's investment environment, especially as China and the US work to try and end a trade war.\" The new laws come into effect on Jan 1st, 2020.</p><p><strong>* MICHIGAN SENTIMENT: </strong>The preliminary University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for March came in at 97.8, well above the expected 95.3, and a large 4 point increase from the previous 93.8. Elsewhere in the survey, the expectations component also blew over estimates, “supporting our view that consumer spending is poised to pick up,” Oxford Economics’ analysts note, “By historical standards, consumer sentiment remains elevated and is not far off from the 98.4 average recorded last year. Household fundamentals remain solid and are supported by job growth, firming wages, lower gas prices, and muted inflation. We look for consumption growth to average a healthy 2.5% in 2019.”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>A slew of Parliamentary votes this week saw UK lawmakers exert further pressure on Mrs May’s Brexit plans with the HoC still unable to agree on the UK’s route of departure from the EU. To recap events, Tuesday saw UK lawmakers reject PM May’s Brexit plan for a second time after AG Cox was unable to alter his opinion on the legal risks surrounding the UK’s ability to unilaterally leave the Irish backstop. Thereafter, Wednesday saw UK lawmakers approve a motion which called on the Government to rule out a no-deal in any scenario before accepting the motion to extend the Article 50 process beyond 29th March on Thursday. With May’s deal still unable to command a majority in Parliament, AG Cox attempted to win over Tory Brexiteers and the DUP with new legal advice which would state Britain will be able to break off from backstop under terms of the Vienna Convention. However, reports towards the end of the week suggested that these efforts were unsuccessful. As such, attention now turns to the prospect of further Parliamentary votes and Thursday/Friday’s European Council meeting. Before the EU Council meeting, there have been suggestions that May could put her deal to Parliament for a third time (MV3) with the PM hopeful that Brexiteers in her own party might be tempted to back her plan amid fears of further delays to Brexit or the possibility of no Brexit at all.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLED USD 0.09 LOWER AT USD 58.52/BBL, BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.07 LOWER AT USD 67.16/BBL. </strong>Crude prices ended the week in a similar manner to Thursday, choppy, with Brent paring back gains made at the beginning of the week before bouncing into settlement. Underpinning the early swing lower was the monthly oil report from the International Energy Agency, “The agency said that OPEC members would be more than capable of mitigating the impact of unplanned supply shortages. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the IEA foresees some 220,000 bpd of global stock draw in the second quarter,” analysts at PVM noted. Elsewhere, Russia’s Energy Minister Novak said it is too early to decide whether the OPEC &amp; Non-OPEC output cut deal should be extended, pouring some water on to the growing expectations of a sustained supply contraction. Baker Hughes Rig Count (15 Mar): total rigs -1 at 1026, oil rigs -1 at 833, gas rigs unchanged at 193.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.49% at 2822, NDX +0.9% at 7307, DJI +0.6% at 25848. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.1%, Materials +0.2%, Industrials -0.2%, Cons Discretionary +0.7%, Cons Staples +0.5%, Healthcare +0.5%, Financials +0.6%, Tech 1.2%, Telecoms 0.0%, Utilities 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Adobe (ADBE)<strong> </strong>dipped lower on Friday, despite beating top and bottom line estimates, after lowering next quarter’s guidance. Oracle (ORCL) nosedived on the open following some pessimistic guidance, but soon reversed the losses. Facebook (FB) was an underperformer on a long-time executive departure. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Broadcom (AVGO) both surged following strong earnings reports. Amazon (AMZN) opened higher after an upgrade at Keybanc, citing increased profitability. Zillow Group (ZG) suffered from a downgrade at Barclays, saying “the worst is yet to come”. Newell Brands (NWL) opened higher following the announcement of its CEO of 10 years retiring, with Wells Fargo analysts commenting bullishly/savagely, “It’s hard to see how things can get any worse.” Apple (AAPL) supported indices to end the week, where a court ruling ordered Qualcomm (QCOM) to pay Apple USD 1bln in rebate fines; Apple also went publicly on the offensive saying that Spotify (SPOT) “wants everything for free” after the music streaming service filed a lawsuit against it.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 8+ TICKS AT HIGHER 122-31.</strong> Treasuries caught a bid on Friday, in a session influenced by both flows and macro themes, where against the grain, equities made healthy gains. The T-plex gained momentum going into the US equity open, with CTA short covering and real money and hedge fund buying kickstarting the rally, also supported by a gloomy outlook from the BoJ on top of North Korea woes, and was exacerbated by the both disappointing Empire Manufacturing survey and Manufacturing/IP data. Once equities opened in the green, Treasuries lost their tailwind as traders took their profits. The curve flattened going into settlement with the belly’s yields falling the most, where the 2s/10s flattened by 2bps. However, spreads in the belly to&nbsp; long-end still remain at their steepest levels in months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Greenback looks all set to end the week on the back foot, with the index pegged towards the bottom of a 97.461-96.371 range having kicked off nearer the apex and just a fraction under 97.400. It has not been all one way traffic, but sub-forecast US data, like CPI, IP, retail sales and durable goods (latter 2 on balance rather than headline terms) have thwarted fleeting recoveries along with strength in major (and EM) currency counterparts and the DXY has been on a downward trajectory overall.</p><p><strong>* NZD/AUD: </strong>The Kiwi and Aussie have both been volatile within 0.6873-0.6783 and 0.7098-23 respective ranges vs their US namesake, but the Aud/Nzd cross has continued to steadily decline (from 1.0365 to sub-1.0300 at one stage) in line with the bearish post-RBA tone prompted by heightened and more widespread dovish calls. That aside, the Antipodean Dollars have been fluctuating with wider risk sentiment, domestic data/surveys and external developments with particular focus on China where a disappointing trade balance has been countered by some positive noises regarding trade negotiations with the US and PBoC/NPC pledges to support the economy as it faces pronounced downside risks. Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd currently around 0.6850 and 0.7085.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Some relative calm after 3 extremely stormy days, but not without incident as the Pound suffered an abrupt early sell-off before stopping the rot ahead of 1.3200 and circa 0.8575 vs the Usd and Eur respectively. Brexit has been by far the biggest driver and focus, with UK Parliament kicking off a series of votes by rejecting PM May’s Withdrawal Agreement for a 2nd time on Tuesday, and precipitating votes on a no deal, which was also ruled out, and finally whether to extend Article 50 beyond March 29 on Thursday, with the latter approved. Sterling typically traded a tad stronger before and after each HoC debate and subsequent vote, which were complicated by various amendments also under consideration, and especially when the no deal or cliff edge scenario was turned down by MPs, although technically and legally still possible. However, Cable has faded from best levels within 1.3383-1.2947 parameters to sit circa 1.3270 and Eur/Gbp is midway between 0.8575-25 (and 0.8675-0.8475 for the week as a whole) as the reality sets in that the EU still has to ratify any request to delay Brexit and wants a concrete reason why, while insisting that the revised deal with additional assurances is the only one available. On that note, a 3rd Meaningful Vote is pencilled in for Tuesday next week, ahead of the 2-day EU Summit on Thursday and Friday and the Government is in talks with the DUP to try and hammer out a compromise that might get majority support this time.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency has extended its post-ECB rebound, partly on the aforementioned generally soft Dollar, and just carved out a minor new high for the week around 1.1345 having triggered hefty option expiry interest just above 1.1300 for the 2nd consecutive session. The Eur has been relatively resilient towards more marked downward revisions to 2019 German GDP forecasts with the aid of some better data and technically on a breach of several key resistance levels.</p><p><strong>* JPY/CHF: </strong>Both ending Friday’s EU session on the front foot vs the Usd, but the Yen still net weaker on the week after some disappointing Japanese data and a dovish BoJ policy meeting, albeit the latter widely expected. Usd/Jpy is right on the 200 DMA at 111.44 vs a high of 111.89 and 110.86 low, while the Franc is nudging its best levels just below parity from almost 1.0100 at the other extreme after less deflationary Swiss producer/import price data and ahead of next week’s quarterly SNB policy review.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> The Loonie failed to get a boost from firmer than forecast Canadian manufacturing sales, as oil prices retreated from new multi-month highs and Usd/Cad bounced off chart support below 1.3300 again. However, the Cad remains some 100 pips off worst levels vs its US rival ahead of March’s FOMC that is expected to compound the more dovish shift via details of an earlier wind down of QT.</p><p><strong>* SEK/NOK: </strong>Strong performances for the Scandi Crowns on balance with decent gains made vs the Euro as the Riksbank continued to downplay soft Swedish inflation and firmer than consensus Norwegian economic inputs underpinned Norges Bank rate hike prospects for next week. Eur/Sek consolidating a clean break of 10.5000 and likewise Eur/Nok its breach of 9.7000.</p><p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> <strong>Monday: </strong>No Tier 1 Data Releases.

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Friday’s form book a pretty good guide overall",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback looks all set to end the week on the back foot, with the index pegged towards the bottom of a 97.461-96.371 range having kicked off nearer the apex and just a fraction under 97.400. It has not been all one way traffic, but sub-forecast US data, like CPI, IP, retail sales and durable goods (latter 2 on balance rather than headline terms) have thwarted fleeting recoveries along with strength in major (and EM) currency counterparts and the DXY has been on a downward trajectory overall.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie have both been volatile within 0.6873-0.6783 and 0.7098-23 respective ranges vs their US namesake, but the Aud/Nzd cross has continued to steadily decline (from 1.0365 to sub-1.0300 at one stage) in line with the bearish post-RBA tone prompted by heightened and more widespread dovish calls. That aside, the Antipodean Dollars have been fluctuating with wider risk sentiment, domestic data/surveys and external developments with particular focus on China where a disappointing trade balance has been countered by some positive noises regarding trade negotiations with the US and PBoC/NPC pledges to support the economy as it faces pronounced downside risks. Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd currently around 0.6850 and 0.7085.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some relative calm after 3 extremely stormy days, but not without incident as the Pound suffered an abrupt early sell-off before stopping the rot ahead of 1.3200 and circa 0.8575 vs the Usd and Eur respectively. Brexit has been by far the biggest driver and focus, with UK Parliament kicking off a series of votes by rejecting PM May’s Withdrawal Agreement for a 2nd time on Tuesday, and precipitating votes on a no deal, which was also ruled out, and finally whether to extend Article 50 beyond March 29 on Thursday, with the latter approved. Sterling typically traded a tad stronger before and after each HoC debate and subsequent vote, which were complicated by various amendments also under consideration, and especially when the no deal or cliff edge scenario was turned down by MPs, although technically and legally still possible. However, Cable has faded from best levels within 1.3383-1.2947 parameters to sit circa 1.3270 and Eur/Gbp is midway between 0.8575-25 (and 0.8675-0.8475 for the week as a whole) as the reality sets in that the EU still has to ratify any request to delay Brexit and wants a concrete reason why, while insisting that the revised deal with additional assurances is the only one available. On that note, a 3rd Meaningful Vote is pencilled in for Tuesday next week, ahead of the 2-day EU Summit on Thursday and Friday and the Government is in talks with the DUP to try and hammer out a compromise that might get majority support this time.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has extended its post-ECB rebound, partly on the aforementioned generally soft Dollar, and just carved out a minor new high for the week around 1.1345 having triggered hefty option expiry interest just above 1.1300 for the 2nd consecutive session. The Eur has been relatively resilient towards more marked downward revisions to 2019 German GDP forecasts with the aid of some better data and technically on a breach of several key resistance levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Both ending Friday’s EU session on the front foot vs the Usd, but the Yen still net weaker on the week after some disappointing Japanese data and a dovish BoJ policy meeting, albeit the latter widely expected. Usd/Jpy is right on the 200 DMA at 111.44 vs a high of 111.89 and 110.86 low, while the Franc is nudging its best levels just below parity from almost 1.0100 at the other extreme after less deflationary Swiss producer/import price data and ahead of next week’s quarterly SNB policy review.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie failed to get a boost from firmer than forecast Canadian manufacturing sales, as oil prices retreated from new multi-month highs and Usd/Cad bounced off chart support below 1.3300 again. However, the Cad remains some 100 pips off worst levels vs its US rival ahead of March’s FOMC that is expected to compound the more dovish shift via details of an earlier wind down of QT.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Strong performances for the Scandi Crowns on balance with decent gains made vs the Euro as the Riksbank continued to downplay soft Swedish inflation and firmer than consensus Norwegian economic inputs underpinned Norges Bank rate hike prospects for next week. Eur/Sek consolidating a clean break of 10.5000 and likewise Eur/Nok its breach of 9.7000.</p>",

Nevertheless, Gilts and Bunds have just posted new intraday highs at 127.13 and 164.45 (+45 and +32 ticks vs -7 and ticks at one stage) and Bunds eclipsed their previous Eurex session peak by a few ticks at 164., as US Treasuries continue to unwind recent bear-steepening amidst a raft of buying from various account types, spread liquidations, stops and upside call option-related hedging. Back to the 10 year EU benchmarks, if the am downturn was indirectly or remotely connected a pre-quadruple witching squeeze in cash bourses then the inverse link has been severed, but the Usd remains under pressure with the DXY back down near 96.500 and fresh session lows.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has rebounded firmly from lows close to 0.6800 vs its US counterpart after a more conciliatory tone from both sides of the US-China trade divide overnight compared to reports circling on Thursday highlighting ongoing issues that remain unresolved and have rolled back the likely date of a Trump-Xi official signing-off Summit. Nzd/Usd is currently towards the top of a 0.6858-24 range, but hampered somewhat by cross-winds as Aud/Nzd consolidates recovery gains above 1.0300 and the Aussie also reclaims lost ground against the Usd to retest resistance ahead of 0.7100.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Also benefiting from the Greenback’s broad loss of momentum as the <strong>DXY </strong>failed to sustain yesterday’s more bullish technical impulses beyond 96.821 and closer to the 97.000 handle. The Loonie is also deriving some impetus from steadier oil prices and could get a helping hand from Canadian manufacturing sales if expectations for a rebound are confirmed. Usd/Cad is hovering just above 1.3300 and back to within striking distance of the 200 DMA. Meanwhile, the single currency continues to try and establish/build a base on the 1.1300 handle, but resistance around the recent 1.1340 high and mega option expiry interest remain formidable barriers to overcome, with 1.9 bn at the big figure and 3.3 bn running off between 1.305-25 at Friday’s NY cut. Turning to the Pound, and a bout of selling saw Cable test underlying bids/support ahead of 1.3200, while Eur/Gbp spiked to 0.8575, but with little obvious in the way of a catalyst and for once relative quiet on the Brexit front the relatively rapid moves have subsequently reversed to circa 1.3275 and 0.8525 respectively.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Both relatively flat vs the Dollar and still rangebound, as Usd/Jpy meanders from 111.90 to 111.50 and just above the 200 DMA (111.44) in wake of a dovish BoJ policy meeting, as widely anticipated. Decent expiries from 111.50-65 (1.1 bn) could underpin the headline pair, while 112.00 and a Fib at 112.08 are keeping the upside in check. The Franc is even more contained within 1.0045-20 and vs the Eur around 1.1350 ahead of next week’s quarterly SNB policy review.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns looks set to end the week on the front foot having regained the initiative over the Euro and crossed psychological/technical levels, and with some added backing from a US bank advocating long positions via the Eur/Sek cross and Usd/Nok -&nbsp; see our headline feed for more details.</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MARKET WRAP: Asia sentiment improved as Trump touted China trade news in 3-4 weeks",
        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded mostly positive across the board as US-China trade optimism helped the region shake off the negative lead from US, where sentiment was subdued by growth and trade concerns following the recent discouraging data from China and delay in the Trump-Xi summit which was said to be pushed back to April. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) were mixed with upside in Australia capped as weakness in mining names and financials offset the continued outperformance in energy, while the Japanese benchmark coat-tailed on recent currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were jubilant as overnight trade-related news flow spurred optimism including comments from President Trump that we will have news regarding a China trade deal in the next 3-4 weeks and although he included a ‘one way or the other’ caveat, he suggested that people will be talking about it for a long time and that China has been very reasonable. In addition, Chinese officials also contributed to the trade hopes after the NPC approved Foreign Investment law reforms dealing with forced tech transfers and IP theft which is seen as an attempt to appease US concerns, while Chinese Premier Li noted that China can use reserve requirements as well as interest rates to support the economy and confirmed VAT tax cuts will begin from next month. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat with demand dampened as focus centred on riskier assets and after the BoJ policy announcement proved to be a non-event in which it maintained policy settings and downgraded assessments on exports and output as expected.</p>",
