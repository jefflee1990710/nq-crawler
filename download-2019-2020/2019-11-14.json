The Democrats had been seeking tweaks to the USMCA enforcement mechanisms for labour and environmental standards, and Pelosi's comments suggest that Republican and Democrats lawmakers are making progress on a agreement, which could be put in front of Congress by the end of this year, although this may be complicated by the House having to pass through government funding measures, amid impeachment proceedings, suggesting that time is tight.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>China has lifted a ban on meat imports from the US, which had spanned almost five years. Reports suggested that this might pave the way for more than USD 1bln of poultry exports to China. US President Trump has made improving US exports of agriculture to China a pivotal part of trade negotiations, thus, auguring well for any potential trade deal. However, towards the tail end of the session FT reported that China and the US are struggling to complete a phase one trade deal, noting both sides are still jostling over IP provisions, agricultural purchases and tariff rollbacks. According to people familiar with the mater, Trump administration officials are frustrated that China has not offered enough concessions to justify a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods, a request China have been vocal about, even this morning reiterating cancelling tariffs is an important condition for achieving a deal. Another source noted China was absolutely delaying the truce with its approach, thus hampering the chances of reaching a final agreement in the coming days on the APEC summit timeline initially agreed upon by both sides.&nbsp; Later, Fox citing US Trade Sources, said there was another deputy level trade talk on the phone between the US and Chinese trade teams, adding talks are progressing.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed Chair Powell's remarks at his testimony to the House Budget committee was similar to the comments he gave to the Joint Economic Committee on Tuesday. In the Q&amp;A part of his testimony, he said the passage of the USMCA would remove uncertainty and be a very good thing for the US economy. Fed's Clarida (voter, neutral) said inflation expectations reside at low end of range he considers consistent with Fed’s price stability mandate; Clarida also said there was no evidence wage growth was placing excessive upward pressure on inflation, believes the natural rate of unemployment extends to 4.0% and below, includes the current rate of 3.6%. Fed's Williams (Voter, Neutral) said the US economy and monetary policy were in a good place, and that the Fed will adjust policy if there is a material change to the outlook. Williams repeated familiar arguments that ongoing uncertainty on trade and geopolitics is making businesses cautious, adding that if the US economy grows as expected, investment should grow as well; he also called on fiscal policy to play a more supportive role in a downturn. Williams also said that the Fed should not get involved with the volatility of trade and Brexit and instead should take a longer view. Fed’s Bullard (Voter, Dove) noted that the Fed can reconsider whether to “take back” the recent insurance cuts if and when business’ adjust to the new trade landscape. Bullard expects growth to slow, but forecasts growth of 2% or higher in the coming months (Note, the Fed’s median forecast for 2019 is 2.2%), hoping rate cuts will help with growth, adding he is hopeful improvements in productivity could push growth above 2%. Fed’s Kaplan (2020 Voter) expects the US economy to grow at a bit more than 2% in 2019; even though growth is sluggish, he doesn't expect a recession in 2020. Kaplan noted the consumer is solid and expressed his concerns on corporate debt. Fed's Evans (Voter, Dove) did not comment on monetary policy.</p><p><strong>* US PPI: </strong>PPI firmed by a little more than expected in October, rising 0.4% M/M (0.3% expected) and the core rate at 0.3% M/M (0.2% expected). The trade services component drove the gains, reversing the fall seen in September. \"Trade services measures margins for retailers and wholesalers, and the numbers are wildly volatile,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics explains, \"behind the headlines, the most striking element of the report is healthcare, where hospital costs jumped by 1.0%, lifting the Y/Y rate to 3.7%, a six-year high.\" Pantheon is unsure how far this will run, but says that the combination of several years with prices rising slower than wages, amid a falling payment-to-cost ratio for Medicare and Medicaid, could prove a toxic mix.\" In terms of the core measure, Pantheon says it overall suggests markets have little to fear from inflation, \"but healthcare accounts for about a fifth of the economy, and a sustained burst of rapid price increases in the sector would make a material difference to the core PCE inflation measure.\"</p><p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> Claims rose to 225k, the highest since June, and above the consensus 215k. Analysts suggested that the rise may be a result of seasonal issues around the Veteran’s Day holiday, although the California wildfires may have contributed. However, analysts generally do not seem too concerned that this marks the beginning of an upsurge, and the recent trend is essentially traversing sideways.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG:</strong> Hong Kong protestors were out in force for a fourth night this week, with the violence having escalated notably since a man was set on fire and another shot in the chest earlier in the week. There were some rumours that the Hong Kong government was mulling implementing a curfew, although these were quickly denied and labelled fake news. US Senator Majority Leader McConnell said that the US senate needs to stand with Hong Kong whilst he hopes they can take action very soon. The Senate is set to consider legislation that would force the State and Commerce Departments to certify annually whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from China to continue receiving unique treatment under US law, and that appears to be on lawmakers minds; US Senator Rubio said the process of passing our Hong Kong Human Rights &amp; Democracy Act by unanimous consent in the Senate has been initiated.</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>North Korean nuclear envoy reportedly has voiced a willingness to meet with US counterparts if negotiated solution of issues is possible, reports Yonhap. Reports had noted that the North Koreans were encouraged by remarks made by US Defence Secretary on Tuesday, where he stated that the US is open to alterations in military activity on the Korean Peninsula to support North Korea diplomacy, which were seen as having a positive effect on dialogue.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MOMR: </strong>OPEC forecast oil demand to grow by 980k BPD in 2019 and 1.08mln BPD in 2020; both forecasts left unchanged from the prior report. The report also noted that OPEC crude production for the month of October increased by 943k BPD to average 29.65mln BPD (Prev. 28.49mln BPD), according to secondary sources. Meanwhile, oil output increased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the UAE, and decreased in Ecuador, Angola, Iraq and Nigeria.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.35 LOWER AT USD 56.77; BRENT (F0) SETTLES USD 0.09 LOWER AT USD 62.28. </strong>Weekly energy inventory data showed a larger than expected 2.2mln bbl build in headline crude stocks (contrasting with API, which showed a surprise draw) and that US production had reached a new all time high of 12.8mln BPD, putting the crude complex under pressure. Gasoline also showed an unexpected build of 1.86mln bbls, while distillates drew 2.5mln bbls, larger than the expected 0.95mln draw. Prior to the data, the crude markets had been on the front foot and had largely been bucking the markets more risk averse tone, with WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 20 futures advancing as high as USD 57.79/bbl and USD 63.21/bbl respectively. These gains were erased post data, with the two contracts falling to lows of USD 56.83/bbl and USD 62.28/bbl respectively. Around settlement, Russia’s President Putin said Russia should continue cooperating with OPEC, adding the cooperation should not only be on oil production cuts. Putin also stated Russia and OPEC can achieve a balanced global oil market without harming other countries.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 14+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-11. </strong>Yields were lower across the curve, with major curve spreads not deviating too much (+/- 1bps or so at settlement). The complex was rallying all day, reaching a peak after another article suggested that US/China trade talks are facing difficulties, but pared back as traders once again reasoned that there was little new substance in the report that shifts the narrative too much.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 3097, NASDAQ-100 0% at 8258, Dow Jones 0% at 27785</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.4%, Consumer Staples -0.1%, Energy -0.3%, Financials 0.1%, Health Care -0.1%, Industrials 0.3%, Information Technology -0.1%, Materials 0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.3%, Utilities 0.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) opened lower after a downgrade at Maxim, citing disappointing survey data for iPhone demand. Goldman Sachs downgraded Kraft Heinz (KHC) to a Sell, and argued that profits are yet to floor with rising cost pressures on the horizon. Edison International (EIX) had a relief rally on reaching a settlement with public entities over 2017 and 2018 Californian fires. Netflix (NFLX) pared some of its losses and Disney (DIS) some of its gains after the latter surged on Wednesday following strong Disney+ subscriber figures. Xerox (XRX) and HP Inc (HPQ) were boosted by remarks from activist investor Carl Icahn, who spoke positively about the potential profit of the merger, and announced he had acquired a stake in HPQ. Tyson Foods (TSN) opened higher, albeit pared somewhat, post China pulling back on its ban of US poultry. American Outdoor Brands (AOBC) traded higher after announcing it would be splitting into two publicly traded companies. Google (GOOGL) rolled slightly towards the close as CNBC reported 50 AG’s are expanding their antitrust investigation into the company’s search and Android business, according to people familiar with the matter. Visa (V) also announced that the FTC requested information on whether its actions limited merchant’s choice.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Cisco (CSCO) had a strong quarter but its shares took a chunky hit after disappointing guidance for the next quarter. Walmart (WMT) beat on profit and raised its guidance, but revenue was a bit light, the stock surged on the open but reversed course throughout the session, with some desks noting that on the surface the EPS was positive, but was primarily driven by a lower tax rate. (NTAP) posted a strong EPS figure and had its PT raised across a handful of research houses. Viacom (VIAB) was firmer following top and bottom line beats ahead of its CBS (CBS) merger.</p><p><strong>* UK POLITICS: </strong>Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party removed a few candidates for the upcoming election, with a key constituent being North Dudley, where political journalists highlighted that it would be an almost certain Conservative gain as 71% of the seat voted leave. Elsewhere, the UK has become a target of a legal case from the European Commission for not naming a new EU Commissioner. Also of note, The Telegraph reported that Brexit Party Voters would rather 'spoil their ballot papers' than vote Conservative in the seats where Brexit Party Leader Farage has stood down his candidates, citing a Lawyer who mediated talks between Farage and PM Johnson.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Havens were once again in demand, with traders citing concerns on growth (China IP soft, weekly claims tick up to highest since June, Germany avoids technical recession though has the weakest growth rate in the G5, Aussie employment was soft, while Japan GDP was also soft) and trade (reports of more ‘snags’ in trade talks); USDJPY beneath 108.50, XAU saw highs just shy of 1475, and EURCHF trades sub 1.09, raising the prospect of SNB intervention (as its policymakers have flagged up recently). There were also reports of some carry trade unwind after an afternoon risk wobble (the wobble itself proved fleeting). The buck fell, allowing the EUR to tick higher, though EURUSD ranges remain thin, with the single currency doing little to convincingly deviate too far from the 1.10 area. AUD was hit in the major FX space, after weak labour market data raises the prospect of RBA cuts, perhaps as early as its next meeting. In the UK, polls continue to see Tories out in front, the party with the only certainty about its Brexit agenda in the medium-term, allowing GBP to rally, though couldn’t manage to get up to 1.29.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>The Mexican central bank cut rates by 25bps, as expected, disappointing a minority who were calling for a 50bps cut. However, the decision was not unanimous, with two members of the board opting for a deeper 50bps cut. Banxico noted that the balance of risks to growth remain to the downside, adding they will maintain a prudent policy stance, stating under the environment of uncertainty it will follow closely the potential pass through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. The bank said bilateral US relations are among risks which could affect Mexican assets; Pemex and Mexico’s sovereign debt rating are other risks. The bank also expects the growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 will be lower than the previous forecasts.</p>",

Gasoline also showed an unexpected build of 1.86mln bbls, while distillates drew 2.5mln bbls, larger than the expected 0.95mln draw.

These gains were erased post data, with the two contracts falling to lows of USD 56.83/bbl and USD 62.28/bbl respectively. Around settlement, Russia’s President Putin said Russia should continue cooperating with OPEC, adding the cooperation should not only be on oil production cuts. Putin also stated Russia and OPEC can achieve a balanced global oil market without harming other countries.</p><p><strong>OPEC MOMR: </strong>OPEC forecast oil demand to grow by 980k BPD in 2019 and 1.08mln BPD in 2020; both forecasts left unchanged from the prior report. The report also noted that OPEC crude production for the month of October increased by 943k BPD to average 29.65mln BPD (Prev. 28.49mln BPD), according to secondary sources. Meanwhile, oil output increased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the UAE, and decreased in Ecuador, Angola, Iraq and Nigeria.</p>",

However, most desks argue that the board will err against providing the market with any kind of dovish surprise. TD Securities argues that \"increasing the easing trajectory would likely result in the market pricing in too aggressive an easing profile into Mexican assets (steps of 50bps instead of 25bps)... could degrade the relatively EM-leading, and peso-supportive yield that has been crucial in minimizing the external risks to inflation (via violent MXN depreciation) that have allowed Banxico to begin its easing process in the first place.\"</li><li>Other factors contributing to a more cautious approach by Banxico include; the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of another sharp increase in the minimum wage in 2020 and the risk of policy-triggered market instability following policy announcements by the Mexican administration, or the US ahead of the Presidential election campaign season.</li><li>Looking ahead, markets expect Banxico to finally “de-couple” from the Fed with a 25bps cut in December, after which the bank is then expected to pursue further easing. Money markets have priced in 75bps worth of easing through the year-end (including the potential 25bps cut this week).&nbsp;With real rates well within restrictive territory at near 4% combined with the benign inflation outlook, analysts at ING see the Banxico delivering a steady pace of 25bp cuts, until the policy rate drops to 6.5% at least.</li></ul>",

Moreover, the downbeat data came just after softer than forecast Japanese GDP and ahead of Chinese IP and Retail Sales misses that undermined broad risk sentiment pending more updates on US-China Phase One and President Trump’s decision on auto tariffs. Aud/Usd has extended losses through 0.6775 and Aud/Jpy has fallen further from 74.00 where 1.6 bn option expiries ran off at the NY cut, but Aud/Nzd held just above 1.0600 as the Kiwi fell in sympathy and gradually unwound more RBNZ inspired gains in the run up to NZ manufacturing PMI and another post-meeting speech from Governor Orr (parliament testimony on the November OCR decision and deliberations). Nzd/Usd now nearer the base of a 0.6364-0.6418 range.</p><p><strong>SEK/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Relative G10 outperformers as the <strong>DXY</strong> continues to hover below 98.500 in narrow confines, with the Swedish Crown shrugging off ongoing statistical and data collation issues tarnishing jobs data, while the Yen and Franc both retain an element of safe-haven demand due to trade and geopolitical factors. Eur/Sek is capped ahead of 10.6900 in contrast to Eur/<strong>NOK</strong> hovering above 10.1000, while Usd/Jpy is still meandering between 108.86-57 and flanked by a Fib below 109.00 and bids/support at 108.50. Elsewhere, Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf reman sub-0.9900 and 1.0900 into a speech from SNB’s Maechler hot on the heels of dovish remarks by President Jordan.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Very minimal deviation outside of prior parameters (Cable 1.2866-26, Usd/Cad 1.3270-45 and Eur/Usd 1.0990-1.1015) or last reaction to data from the Pound, Loonie and Euro respectively even though UK retail sales were worse than expected, Canadian new house prices were a bit firmer than forecast and German GDP defied consensus that would have meant a technical recession.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Zar and Try remain divergent on supportive SA data vs ongoing Turkish-US tensions due to Syria and S-400/F-35 conflicts of interest/opinion, but Latam currencies are broadly depreciating alongside and in contagion with the Clp despite Chile’s Central Bank pledging to inject more liquidity and intervene in an effort to stem the tide and prevent a more intense capital flight.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has tumbled to the bottom of the G10 table after a raft of sub-forecast data overnight, kicking off with Japanese Q3 GDP and extending through Australia’s October jobs report to Chinese IP and Retail Sales. Naturally, the big disappointment and shock was a decline in payrolls that was mostly down to a fall in permanent positions and contributed to an uptick in the unemployment rate, albeit in line with expectations. Aud/Usd recoiled from just over 0.6840 to sub-0.6800, while Aud/Nzd retreated further from pre-RBNZ peaks through 1.0650 and towards 1.0625 as the Kiwi holds up better vs a still rangebound Greenback (<strong>DXY </strong>meandering between 98.427-282) and within sight of the 0.6400 handle awaiting NZ manufacturing PMI and more from Governor Orr on the surprise decision to keep rates on hold this month. Note, Bascand underlined switch to wait-and-see mode last night, though left the door open to another OCR cut next February, if warranted.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/GBP/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the US Dollar, with the Yen and Franc maintaining an underlying bid and safe-haven premium even though China may have alleviated some trade jitters amidst reports of an ag snag by lifting its ban on US poultry. Usd/Jpy remains below a key Fib and pivoting chart support ahead of 108.50, while Aud/Jpy has retreated to around 73.80 amidst the all round Aussie underperformance noted above, but could pare some losses and revisit 74.00 given a hefty 1.6 bn option expiries in the cross at that strike. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is back under 0.9900 and Eur/Chf near the base of a 1.0903-1.0864 band ahead of a speech by SNB’s Maechler that may well be used as another opportunity to espouse the mantra of sub-zero rates and proactive currency intervention to ensure that the Franc does not appreciate to excessive levels. Elsewhere, Sterling only saw a shallow and brief set-back when UK retail sales fell well short of consensus, with Cable back above 1.2850 and flirting with the 10 DMA, while Eur/Gbp is retesting 0.8555 stops, as Eur/Usd relinquishes 1.1000+ status recovered in wake of German Q3 GDP data beating forecasts that would have consigned the economy to a technical recession if confirmed. Note, however, the single currency is still finding support close to a 1.0993 Fib, while the Loonie is straddling 1.3250 again and eyeing Canadian new house prices to provide independent direction and a distraction to US claims and PPI.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although Statistics Sweden has issued another warning about the reliability and sample size of the figures used to formulate monthly employment reports, the Swedish Krona appears to be taking the data at face value, as Eur/Sek probes below 10.6900 vs almost 10.7300 at one stage and compared to Eur/Nok that is elevated above 10.1000 and has been as high as 10.1300+.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some positive platitudes and constructive discussions, but no resolutions from the talks between Turkish and US Presidents has left the Lira under pressure and only a little off worst levels vs the Buck near 5.7800 in contrast to the Rand that has recouped losses on the back of significantly better that anticipated SA mining production and irrespective of persistent output disruption at Eskom. Indeed, Usd/Zar has pulled back sharply from 15.0000+ peaks to sub-14.8300 before bouncing.</p>",

Gilts are just shy of 131.70 vs 131.36 at worst and Wednesday’s 131.38 settlement and 3 month contracts are 0.5-1.5 ticks ahead compared to +2 ticks at best, awaiting the 4th and final piece of primary domestic data for this week in the guise of retail sales that are seen firmer than previous overall, but as always have the propensity to be erratic. Meanwhile, cash markets will presumably make room for long end issuance at some stage given the DMO’s Gbp2.25 bn 2049 offering some 60 minutes later.</p>",

The core Eurozone debt future has settled down more recently between 170.63-26 parameters, just above yesterday’s session best and close (170.45 and 170.36 respectively).

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed after a tentative lead from Wall St peers amid ongoing trade uncertainty and as the region digests several substandard tier-1 data releases. ASX 200 (+0.3%) is positive with tech and consumer staples leading the early broad gains across Australia’s sectors and with abysmal jobs data supporting prospects the RBA may need to ease further. Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) succumbed to softer than expected Q3 GDP which disappointed hopes of front-loading ahead of the sales tax hike and raised questions regarding the Q4 outlook, although there were some success stories with Yahoo Japan the biggest gainer on news of a potential merger with Line Corp which also provided a tailwind for their respective parents SoftBank and Naver. Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) trade subdued amid the ongoing precarious US-China trade climate as President Trump commented that a deal is moving along very rapidly, although other reports suggested trade talks may have hit a snag over agricultural purchases. Furthermore, sentiment has also been dragged by weaker than expected Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data, as well as the continued unrest in Hong Kong where protesters persevere with their new strategy of weekday disruptions.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains unchanged and has continued its range-bound trade following inconclusive inflation data and after Fed Chair Powell provided nothing new during his testimony in Congress where he repeated that the Fed's policy stance was likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming data was consistent with the Fed's outlook but added that noteworthy risks remain. The greenback’s major counterparts are also lacklustre with EUR/USD attempting a breakdown of the 1.1000 handle and with GBP/USD marginally pulling back from resistance at 1.2850, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are choppy with a slight bias to the downside in the aftermath of the soft data. Antipodeans are the underperformers with AUD/USD leading the declines to test 0.6800 to the downside after the poor Chinese data and weak Australian jobs numbers which showed an increase in the Unemployment Rate to 5.3% from 5.2%, as well as a surprise contraction in Employment Change by 19k jobs.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they sustain the prior day’s rebound to test resistance at 153.00, with prices also supported by the risk averse tone and following weaker than expected Q3 economic growth.</p>",
