        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 11 Jan 2019: US govt shutdown becomes the longest in history",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down/flat, Treasuries up, crude down, dollar up<br />* REAR-VIEW: CPI in line; Brexit increasingly likely to be delayed; GM raises FY 19 guidance.<br />* WEEK AHEAD: US retail sales (likely postponed), Brexit vote, UK CPI, retail sales; Canada CPI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>Sources cited by Fox News suggested that internal data showed that the impact of shutdown will hit the US economy shortly, as officials grow increasingly worried about economic impact of impasse; Fox also said that US President Trump is likely to end impasse, potentially as soon as next week. Fox News also reported that the White House economic team was divided over attendance at the WEF at the end of the month, with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin planning to attend, though NEC Director Kudlow does not. Later in the session, Trump said he will sign a bill for back pay for Federal workers. Meanwhile, other reports suggest that the OMB has reportedly drafted plans for a government shutdown that runs through February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>December&rsquo;s inflation report came in line with expectations (headline 1.9% YY, -0.1% MM; core unch at 2.2%, Core MM 0.2% again), with the headline held back by weak gasoline prices, as was expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the sharp drop in used auto prices didn&rsquo;t materialize, adding that CPI measure is hugely overshooting relative to auction prices, so a big drop is coming sooner or later, we just don&rsquo;t know exactly when. Airline fares fell less than we expected too, down 1.5% m/m; further declines are coming in the wake of the fall in oil prices. The core measure rose broadly, taking the three-month annualised rate to 2.5%, which Pantheon observes is the highest since March. &ldquo;The run of 0.2% increase in the past three months follows 0.1% Aug/Sep gains, so y/y core inflation has been stuck at 2.2% for the past five straight months. Even if the Dec m/m increase is repeated through Q1 - a tall order given the downward pressure on used auto prices and airline fares - base effects will push the y/y rate down to 2.1% until April.&rdquo; Looking ahead, the consultancy does not see core rising above the 2.3% seen in July until June this year, unless the run-rate increases. &ldquo;Tariffs on consumer goods would do that overnight, but we&rsquo;re expecting the US and China to reach agreement soon to prevent that from happening,&rdquo; and in the meantime, &ldquo;the recent core CPI numbers ought to weaken the idea that the US faces meaningful renewed disinflation pressure; we just don&rsquo;t see that.&rdquo; Pantheon also cites the recent NFIB survey of selling prices, which I says hints at higher inflation in the second half of 2019, adding that, for now, the numbers are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Ahead of next week&rsquo;s Meaningful Vote, the Evening Standard reported that Brexit is looking increasingly likely to be delayed beyond March 29th amid a backlog of essential bills, citing Cabinet Ministers; it is worth noting that this is due to technical reasons, rather than a fundamental change of position from the UK. On Friday, a spokesperson for UK PM May once again ruled out an extension to Article 50. There were also reports from BuzzFeed which pointed out that Conservative MEPs have been summoned to Downing Street to meet the PM, and a Number 10 source said it was a regular meeting; however, MEPs speculated that an extension of Article 50 could mean they would have to stand in the European Parliament&rsquo;s May elections. For a more in depth take on next week&rsquo;s Brexit vote, see our week in focus (link available at the bottom of this report). Finally, ahead of the vote, UK ministers reportedly have told PM May to seek help from opposition leader Corbyn when Brexit deal is voted down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURE (H19) SETTLS 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 121-30+: </strong>Treasuries firmed on Friday amid the longest US government shutdown in history, as well as reports that the PBOC is becoming wary of yuan strength, while geopolitical headlines also influenced (reports of Turkish troops along the Syrian border). The modest bounce continued after an in-line CPI report, though the complex saw some profit-taking towards the European close, sources noted. Yields were lower across the curve at settlement, with most of the action in the belly, where they fell by around 3bps. Major spreads were mixed, with 2s5s and 2s10s narrowing by around 1bps, while 2s30s and 5s30s steepened by 0.5bps and 2bps respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G19) SETTLES $1.00 LOWER AT $51.59; BRENT (H19) SETTLES $1.20 LOWER AT $60.48: </strong>Crude futures are looking to snap their impressive run of gains, which had seen WTI&#39;s run extend to straight sessions. Without a lot of crude-specific news, the complex was taking its cue from equities, with profit-taking reported once again on Friday. &quot;This looks largely like a minor technical correction rather than a reaction to a shift in the underlying fundamental condition of the markets, although it&rsquo;s possible the petroleum market reached the limit of how far it could rally in the face of surging US product inventories,&quot; Citi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.02% at 2596, NDX -0.3% at 6601, DJI -0.04% at 23993. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.6%, Materials -0.4%, Industrials 0.1%, Cons Discretionary -0.1%, Cons Staples +0.3%, Healthcare ++0.3%, Financials +0.2%, Tech -0.1%, Telecoms -0.1%, Utilities -0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>General Motors (GM) and PVH Corp (PVH) surged on the open after raising their guidance. Infosys (INFY) was a gainer following its earnings report and a share repurchase programme. Netflix (NFLX) opened higher after upgrades at UBS and Raymond James. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) underperformed after it gave publishing rights away for its Destiny franchise. PG&amp;E (PCG) traded lower after its credit rating was downgraded to junk at Moddy&rsquo;s. Alphabet (GOOGL) opened lower over reports it was being sued by shareholders for keeping sexual misconduct claims hidden. Amazon (AMZN) came under negative light following reports of privacy issues with its Ring smart doorbell and Germany banning its Dash device. Apple (AAPL) moved lower on the open, as new iPhone release details failed to impress investors. Starbucks (SBUX) came under pressure after Goldman downgraded the stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX WEEKLY - DXY: </strong>It has been a turbulent week for the Dollar in light of this week&rsquo;s dovish Fed speakers and FOMC minutes alongside a three-day trade meeting between US-China which at first seemed promising, though sticking points remain on issues such as IP. DXY kicked off the week on the 96.000 handle and reached highs of 96.159, however a plethora of Fed speaks sent the index lower to test 95.000 to the downside at one point. The most notable move coincided with comments from non-voter Bostic who floated the idea of a rate cut if downside risk all come to bear, thought Chair Powell and Vice Chair Clarida aided the decent of the buck by stating the Central Bank can be patient and flexible when it comes tightening. Fed aside, the US Government poised to be shut for a longest in the last 43 years as President Trump fails to accumulate the funding from the Democrats for the Southern border wall, and it&rsquo;s worth noting US loses 0.1% of GDP for every week the Government is shut. Shortly after the Wall St. open on Friday, FX markets experience a bout of Dollar demand wherein DXY reclaimed 95.500 to the upside and rose as high as 95.765 at one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Tumultuous week for the GBP and the UK Government after double-defeat in the House of Commons in the form of the Finance Bill (restricting Government tax power in the event of a no-deal Brexit) and Business Motion (restricting the timeframe for an alternative proposal if the PM loses the meaningful vote). Cable started the week around 1.2730 and visited (but failed to close above) 1.2800 for three out of five days (so far). Although the weekly high of 1.2850 was fuelled by reports of a potential delay to the Brexit date, this was later dismissed by a UK PM May spokeswoman as Cable retreated from the highs. Meanwhile on the data front, the Pound largely shrugged the release of the in-line UK monthly GDP and mixed industrial output as traders eye next week&rsquo;s meaningful vote to shed some uncertainty surrounding Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Overall a positive week for the EUR, albeit largely due to the decline of the buck as the single currency only appreciated from its weekly open at 1.1390 to reach highs of 1.1570 at one point. Earlier in the week, the EUR was relatively unfazed by the release of the ECB Minutes and Eurozone unemployment, though Friday saw volatile trade in the EUR/USD as most of the session saw the pair above 1.1500, though a sudden bout of dollar strength sent the pair down through its 50 DMA at 1.1477 to levels just shy if 1.1450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Not the most eventful week for the Yen as US-Sino trade talks at the start of the week unwound risk premium in the currency in which USD/JPY made an attempt at reclaiming the 109.00 handle to the upside. However, after a third day of dialogue and no mention of development in key sticking points (alongside a pullback in the USD), the currency pair fell back to sub-108.00 levels at one point. Overall, given the recent Dollar demand, USD/JPY is poised to end the week little changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CNY: </strong>Notably the outperformers with the antipodeans on course to close the week with gains in excess of a percent vs. the buck, while the CNY is poised for its best week since 2005 with aid from the dovish Fed and a sub-6.80 PBOC fix. Upside in the AUD and NZD was mostly due to tailwinds from its Chinese counterpart alongside supportive price action in the commodities complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, NOK: </strong>Both beneficiaries of the rising oil prices with CAD covering further ground below 1.3400 against the buck, while the Crown took out 9.800 to the downside vs the EUR as Brent crude is set to end the week with gains in excess of 5%. The Loonie was also swayed by the BoC rate decisions which USD/CAD initially saw a dovish reaction and rose to levels just shy of 1.3250 as the Central Bank cut its growth and inflation forecasts, although this was expected. The currency pair then headed lower in a hawkish move to a low print of 1.3180 in light of the of BoC noting that rates will rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range depending on oil market and trade developments, in turn maintaining their tightening bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEK AHEAD: </strong>Monday: Eurozone Industrial Production, Chinese Trade Balance. Tuesday: Brexit Meaningful Vote, US PPI, New Zealand GDT Auction, Indonesian Interest Rate Decision, Japan Machinery Orders. Wednesday: Fed&#39;s Beige Book, UK CPI, US Retail Sales, NAHB Housing Market Index. Thursday: Eurozone CPI (Final), US Building Permits &amp; Philly Fed, Japan CPI. Friday: South Korea Interest Rate Decision, UK Retail Sales, Canada CPI, US Industrial Production &amp; Uni of Mich. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20914/download\">Click here to read full preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Rosy week-end for the Yuan, meanwhile US Government shutdown hits 21 days ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>- It has been a turbulent week for the Dollar in light of this week&rsquo;s dovish Fed speakers and FOMC minutes alongside a three-day trade meeting between US-China which at first seemed promising, though sticking points remain on issues such as IP. DXY kicked off the week on the 96.000 handle and reached highs of 96.159, however a plethora of Fed speaks sent the index lower to test 95.000 to the downside at one point. The most notable move coincided with comments from non-voter Bostic who floated the idea of a rate cut if downside risk all come to bear, thought Chair Powell and Vice Chair Clarida aided the decent of the buck by stating the Central Bank can be patient and flexible when it comes tightening. Fed aside, the US Government poised to be shut for a longest in the last 43 years as President Trump fails to accumulate the funding from the Democrats for the Southern border wall, and it&rsquo;s worth noting US loses 0.1% of GDP for every week the Government is shut. Shortly after the Wall St. open on Friday, FX markets experience a bout of Dollar demand wherein DXY reclaimed 95.500 to the upside and rose as high as 95.765 at one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong>&ndash; Tumultuous week for the GBP and the UK Government after double-defeat in the House of Commons in the form of the Finance Bill (restricting Government tax power in the event of a no-deal Brexit) and Business Motion (restricting the timeframe for an alternative proposal if the PM loses the meaningful vote). Cable started the week around 1.2730 and visited (but failed to close above) 1.2800 for three out of five days (so far). Although the weekly high of 1.2850 was fuelled by reports of a potential delay to the Brexit date, this was later dismissed by a UK PM May spokeswoman as Cable retreated from the highs. Meanwhile on the data front, the Pound largely shrugged the release of the in-line UK monthly GDP and mixed industrial output as traders eye next week&rsquo;s meaningful vote to shed some uncertainty surrounding Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong>&ndash; Overall a positive week for the EUR, albeit largely due to the decline of the buck as the single currency only appreciated from its weekly open at 1.1390 to reach highs of 1.1570 at one point. Earlier in the week, the EUR was relatively unfazed by the release of the ECB Minutes and Eurozone unemployment, though Friday saw volatile trade in the EUR/USD as most of the session saw the pair above 1.1500, though a sudden bout of dollar strength sent the pair down through its 50 DMA at 1.1477 to levels just shy if 1.1450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong> &ndash; Not the most eventful week for the Yen as US-Sino trade talks at the start of the week unwound risk premium in the currency in which USD/JPY made an attempt at reclaiming the 109.00 handle to the upside. However, after a third day of dialogue and no mention of development in key sticking points (alongside a pullback in the USD), the currency pair fell back to sub-108.00 levels at one point. Overall, given the recent Dollar demand, USD/JPY is poised to end the week little changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD, CNY</strong> &ndash; Notably the outperformers with the antipodeans on course to close the week with gains in excess of a percent vs. the buck, while the CNY is poised for its best week since 2005 with aid from the dovish Fed and a sub-6.80 PBoC fix. Upside in the AUD and NZD was mostly due to tailwinds from its Chinese counterpart alongside supportive price action in the commodities complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD, NOK</strong> &ndash; Both beneficiaries of the rising oil prices with CAD covering further ground below 1.3400 against the buck, while the Crown took out 9.800 to the downside vs the EUR as Brent crude is set to end the week with gains in excess of 5%. The Loonie was also swayed by the BoC rate decisions which USD/CAD initially saw a dovish reaction and rose to levels just shy of 1.3250 as the Central Bank cut its growth and inflation forecasts, although this was expected. The currency pair then headed lower in a hawkish move to a low print of 1.3180 in light of the of BoC noting that rates will rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range depending on oil market and trade developments, in turn maintaining their tightening bias.</p>\r\n",

(Evening Standard) However, this has been dismissed by a UK PM May spokesperson.

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leading Brexiteer and former Brexit Minister Steve Baker is planning to publish a new Brexit deal proposal which intends to take a tougher line with Brussels. Another former minister told the newspaper that serving ministers may stand down to vote against the PM&rsquo;s Brexit deal.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are mixed [Euro Stoxx 50 Unch], having pared back some of the initial gains from the open. Some initial outperformance was seen in the FTSE 100 (+0.1%) which is lead by strong performances in UK housing names after the sector was upgraded by BAML, with Persimmon (+4.4%), Taylor Wimpey (+4.8%) and Barratt Development (+2.6%) at the top of the index, however, the index was later pressured on currency effects as Sterling whipsawed on Brexit developments. Sectors are similarly in the green with some slight outperformance seen in energy names. Other notable movers include, Richemont (+2.3%) after the Co&rsquo;s Q3 revenue of EUR 3.92bln was in line with the expected EUR 3.93bln and posting a 5% rise in constant currency sales for the October-December period. Meanwhile, Suez (-3.1%), Veolia (-2.6%) and Sage Group (-2.6%) are all in the red after being downgraded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Choppy session for the index but ultimately on the backfoot after losing the 95.500 level in early Asia-Pac trade as the Fed signalled a more patient approach ahead of the US CPI release later today. Both Fed Chair Powell and Vice Chair Clarida noted the Central Bank has the ability to be patient and flexible on rates given the State-side inflation data. As such the DXY fell to an overnight session low of 95.322 (vs. high of 95.508) and currently hovers around the middle of the range with US CPI in sight. Lloyds notes that the sharp decline in energy will likely weight on the headline CPI as they forecast a fall to 1.9% from 2.2%, though they expect the core figure to remain steady at 2.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD,NZD, CNY, CAD &ndash; The marked outperformers and major beneficiaries as the USD/CNY is poised for its best week since 2005 with aid from the dovish Fed and a sub-6.80 PBoC fix. AUD/USD currently resides north of 0.7200 (vs. low of 0.7183) and reached levels last seen mid-December as optimistic Australian retail sales also underpinned the Aussie currency. Meanwhile, the Kiwi stands at the G10 leader as tailwind from its antipodean counterpart boosted the NZD/USD above its 50 and 200 DMA at 0.6786 and 0.6799 respectively to test 0.6840 to the upside, with the DMAs also set to form a golden cross. Finally, the Loonie is on the front foot as it reaps its reward from the declining greenback and the rising oil price with USD/CAD now below 1.3200 (vs. high of 1.3245) ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.3169.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP,EUR, JPY &ndash; All taking advantage of the receding dollar with the Pound spiking higher on reports by the Evening Standard that the Brexit date is to be delayed beyond March 29th amid a backlog of essential bills, though this was later dismissed by a PM May spokesperson. As such Cable briefly reclaimed the 1.2800 handle before hitting psychological resistance at 1.2850 ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.2892, this move was then paired back to sub-1.2800 levels as the pair stabilised around 1.2780. Subsequently EUR/GBP fell through 0.9000 past its 50, 100 and 200 HMAs before touching support at 0.8980, this move was short-lived due to the denial from the spokesperson with the pair now hovering on either side of 0.9000. Before the Evening Standard report, the Pound was largely unmoved by the in-line monthly GDP figures and mixed output data as traders remain cautious of political developments with the meaningful vote taking place on January 15th, though there were unconfirmed reports that EU&rsquo;s Tusk and Juncker may send PM May a letter of assurances regarding the NI backstop by Monday. Elsewhere, EUR/USD reclaimed the 1.1500 handle and resides close to its 50 HMA at 1.1522. Option expiries for the single currency are in focus today with 3bln of strikes rolling off at 1.1500-10 and 1bln at 1.1550. It is also worth noting that the Bank of France maintained the country&rsquo;s Q4 GDP forecast at 0.2% despite the domestic turmoil from the Yellow Vest protests. Meanwhile the Yen is relatively docile in regards to risk-flow and largely dominated by the buck with USD/JPY trades within a tight 108.24-47 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Fixed income assets have kicked off the session in the green ahead of upcoming key risk events. Gilts were essentially unreactive to GDP data that came in essentially in line with expectations, whilst the output data was mixed, and remain mindful of developments in Westminster ahead of next week&rsquo;s meaningful vote. The UK benchmark is hanging around the high print of the day at 123.51 with traders eying yesterday&rsquo;s high print of 123.70 as the next level of resistance. 10-year Bund futures are probing the 164.50 level to the upside and 2s10s are seeing some bull flattening. BTPs are the days outperformer and trading with gains of over 30-ticks as the Italian benchmark finds a firm footing above the 126.80 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UST futures are also higher across the curve with the majority of the action in the belly of the curve after yesterday&rsquo;s dovish Fed commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Clarida alongside President Trump&rsquo;s comments that he would declare an emergency should no border wall deal emerge and ahead of US CPI later in the day. On the supply side, yesterday&rsquo;s 30yr auction had a poor showing with the b/c printing 2.19x vs. 2.31 prev.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.6%) and WTI (+0.8%) prices are in the green benefiting from the positive sentiment seen across US and Asian sessions after dovish comments from multiple Fed speakers.

Elsewhere, India&rsquo;s steel ministry is refusing to back down on tougher import rules on steel, pressuring automakers into using local steel instead.</p>\r\n",

Some outperformance is seen in the FTSE 100 (+0.4%) which is in the green on strong performance in UK housing names after the sector was upgraded by BAML, with Persimmon (+3.2%), Taylor Wimpey (+3.7%) and Barratt Development (+1.7%) at the top of the index. Sectors are similarly in the green with some slight outperformance seen in energy names. Other notable movers include, Richemont (+1.8%) after the Co&rsquo;s Q3 revenue of EUR 3.92bln was in line with the expected EUR 3.93bln and posting a 5% rise in constant currency sales for the October-December period. Meanwhile, Suez (-3.2%), Veolia (-2.3%) and Sage Group (-2.3%) are all in the red after being downgraded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Choppy session for the index but ultimately on the backfoot after losing the 95.500 level in early Asia-Pac trade as the Fed signalled a more patient approach ahead of the US CPI release later today. Both Fed Chair Powell and Vice Chair Clarida noted the Central Bank has the ability to be patient and flexible on rates given the State-side inflation data. As such the DXY fell to an overnight session low of 95.322 (vs. high of 95.508) and currently hovers around the middle of the range with US CPI in sight. Lloyds notes that the sharp decline in energy will likely weight on the headline CPI as they forecast a fall to 1.9% from 2.2%, though they expect the core figure to remain steady at 2.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD,NZD, CNY, CAD &ndash; The marked outperformers and major beneficiaries as the USD/CNY is poised for its best week since 2005 with aid from the dovish Fed and a sub-6.80 PBoC fix. AUD/USD currently resides north of 0.7200 (vs. low of 0.7183) and reached levels last seen mid-December as optimistic Australian retail sales also underpinned the Aussie currency. Meanwhile, the Kiwi stands at the G10 leader as tailwind from its antipodean counterpart boosted the NZD/USD above its 50 and 200 DMA at 0.6786 and 0.6799 respectively to test 0.6840 to the upside, with the DMAs also set to form a golden cross. Finally, the Loonie is on the front foot as it reaps its reward from the declining greenback and the rising oil price with USD/CAD now below 1.3200 (vs. high of 1.3245) ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.3169.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP,EUR, JPY &ndash; All taking advantage of the receding dollar with the Pound spiking higher on reports by the Evening Standard that the Brexit date is to be delayed beyond March 29th amid a backlog of essential bills. As such Cable reclaimed the 1.2800 handle before hitting psychological resistance at 1.2850 ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.2892. Subsequently EUR/GBP fell through 0.9000 past its 50, 100 and 200 HMAs before touching support at 0.8980. Before the Evening Standard report, the Pound was largely unmoved by the in-line monthly GDP figures and mixed output data as traders remain cautious of political developments with the meaningful vote taking place on January 15th, though there were unconfirmed reports that EU&rsquo;s Tusk and Juncker may send PM May a letter of assurances regarding the NI backstop by Monday.

        "subject": "FX: Buck back on the retreat as US CPI draws nearer",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Choppy session for the index but ultimately on the backfoot after losing the 95.500 level in early Asia-Pac trade as the Fed signalled a more patient approach ahead of the US CPI release later today. Both Fed Chair Powell and Vice Chair Clarida noted the Central Bank has the ability to be patient and flexible on rates given the State-side inflation data. As such the DXY fell to an overnight session low of 95.322 (vs. high of 95.508) and currently hovers around the middle of the range with US CPI in sight. Lloyds notes that the sharp decline in energy will likely weight on the headline CPI as they forecast a fall to 1.9% from 2.2%, though they expect the core figure to remain steady at 2.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD,NZD, CNY, CAD</strong> &ndash; The marked outperformers and major beneficiaries as the USD/CNY is poised for its best week since 2005 with aid from the dovish Fed and a sub-6.80 PBoC fix. AUD/USD currently resides north of 0.7200 (vs. low of 0.7183) and reached levels last seen mid-December as optimistic Australian retail sales also underpinned the Aussie currency. Meanwhile, the Kiwi stands at the G10 leader as tailwind from its antipodean counterpart boosted the NZD/USD above its 50 and 200 DMA at 0.6786 and 0.6799 respectively to test 0.6840 to the upside, with the DMAs also set to form a golden cross. Finally, the Loonie is on the front foot as it reaps its reward from the declining greenback and the rising oil price with USD/CAD now below 1.3200 (vs. high of 1.3245) ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.3169.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP,EUR, JPY</strong> &ndash; All taking advantage of the receding dollar with the Pound largely unmoved by the in-line monthly GDP figures and mixed output data as traders remain cautious of political developments with the meaningful vote taking place on January 15th, though there were unconfirmed reports that EU&rsquo;s Tusk and Juncker may send PM May a letter of assurances regarding the NI backstop by Monday.&nbsp; Cable sits in close proximity to intraday-highs after having hit resistance at its 50 DMA around 1.2770. Some traders also note that upside in Sterling could be aided by BHP&rsquo;s special dividend paid out to UK&rsquo;s shareholders. Elsewhere, EUR/USD reclaimed the 1.1500 handle and resides close to its 50 HMA at 1.1522. Option expiries for the single currency are in focus today with 3bln of strikes rolling off at 1.1500-10 and 1bln at 1.1550. It is also worth noting that the Bank of France maintained the country&rsquo;s Q4 GDP forecast at 0.2% despite the domestic turmoil from the Yellow Vest protests. Meanwhile the Yen is relatively docile in regards to risk-flow and largely dominated by the buck with USD/JPY trades within a tight 108.24-47 range.</p>\r\n",

The UK benchmark is hanging around the high print of the day at 123.51 with traders eying yesterday&rsquo;s high print of 123.70 as the next level of resistance. 10-year Bund futures are probing the 164.50 level to the upside and 2s10s are seeing some bull flattening. BTPs are the days outperformer and trading with gains of over 30-ticks as the Italian benchmark finds a firm footing above the 126.50 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UST futures are also higher across the curve with the majority of the action in the belly of the curve after yesterday&rsquo;s dovish Fed commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Clarida alongside President Trump&rsquo;s comments that he would declare an emergency should no border wall deal emerge and ahead of US CPI later in the day. On the supply side, yesterday&rsquo;s 30yr auction had a poor showing with the b/c printing 2.19x vs. 2.31 prev. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

The softer greenback has also begun to pare back some of the risk-fuelled advances in USD/JPY, while antipodeans are mildly underpinned by their high-beta status and following better than expected Australian Retail Sales, although resistance at the 0.7200 handle has restricted upside for AUD/USD. CNH has continued to firm with USD/CNH now below 6.7700 after the reference rate setting in which the PBoC adjusted the fix to its strongest since late July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre on profit taking following recent gains and with demand also limited by the upside in riskier assets.</p>\r\n",
