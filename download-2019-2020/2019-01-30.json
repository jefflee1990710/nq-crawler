(Newswires)<br /><br />FOMC said it will continue to unwind the balance sheet by forgoing reinvestment of up to USD 50bln in maturing securities each month but added that it is prepared to adjust balance sheet normalisation process in light of recent economic and financial conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOMC removed reference to &quot;gradual&quot; rate hikes and reference to risks to the economic outlook being roughly balanced, while it said it will be patient as it determines what future rate adjustments should be, especially in light of economic &amp; financial developments as well as muted inflation measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell said rates are now in the range of estimates of neutral and cited data dependency when asked whether the next rate move will be up or down. Powell also said he does not want the balance sheet to cause market turbulence and that Fed discussions will soon turn to the ultimate composition of Fed&#39;s balance sheet, while he added that there will be some imprint of government shutdown on Q1 GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reaction to the statement was notably dovish since the Fed indicated a willingness to adjust the pace of the balance sheet run-off. The message of patience was reiterated with the Fed removing the reference to hike rates gradually. The language on the balance of risks (was &quot;roughly balanced) was dropped. Its view of the economy was tweaked to &quot;solid&quot; from a previous &quot;strong&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advisors to Chinese officials reportedly said &quot;ironically&quot; Trump&#39;s trade demands are better in the long-term for China than the US.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Council President Tusk tweeted a message to PM May that the EU position is clear and consistent and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation, while he added we found out what the UK doesn&#39;t want but we still don&rsquo;t know what the UK does want.

Alibaba (BABA) opened in the green after beating EPS estimates and citing little effect from trade tensions on the co. Other notable companies reporting today were Boeing (BA), General Dynamics (GD), Stryker (SYK) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) who all beat on EPS and revenue estimates, seeing them outperform on the open. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged after its earnings, where it missed on revenue estimates but analysts attributing the miss not as gloomy as competitor NVIDIA (NVDA) had previously painted for the semiconductor space. McDonalds (MCD) traded higher on the open after strong EPS and comparable sales but pared back gains later after citing struggles in the US in its conference call. Amgen (AMGN) underperformed on the back of lowering its 2019 guidance. Israel-based Mellanox (MLNX) outperformed as Intel (INTC) bid USD 5.5bln-6bln for the co. in a cash and stock deal. Citigroup (C) found relief following regulators dropping plans of fining the bank for discriminatory mortgage lending. General Electric (GE) traded higher after announcing it was combining renewable and grid assets into one unit as well as seeing bidding interest for its Capital Aviation Services. Allergan (AGN) and Whirlpool (WHR) underperformed following downgrades at Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital respectively. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) benefitted from a New Buy initiation at Goldman.

The Fed took a dovish stance, removing references to gradual rate hikes and also mentioned its openness to tweaking the balance sheet runoff, as of such, treasuries caught a large bid with the front end leading causing steepening across the curve; the 2/30 seeing the greatest steepening at c.7bps. Elsewhere, the US Treasury announced next week it will sell USD 38bln in 3yr, USD 27bln in 10yr and USD 19bln in 30yr; to raise USD 29.9bln in new cash; as expected. US T-note futures (H9) settled 7 ticks higher at 122-00.</p>\r\n",

All of those factors saw dovish tweaks in the latest statement: on the balance sheet, the FOMC indicated that it was prepared to adjust the pace of the balance sheet run-off, it dumped language on &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; rate hikes, adding in that the Committee will be &ldquo;patient&rdquo; on future hikes. The language around &ldquo;roughly balanced&rdquo; risks was also dumped, and it downgraded its view of the economy slightly, now characterising it as &ldquo;solid&rdquo; from &ldquo;strong&rdquo;. The Fed also changed its view on inflation, which it now sees as &ldquo;muted&rdquo;. There were some fears among traders that the Fed might not be as dovish as hoped for; that fear was jettisoned with the release of the statement, and the dovish Fed was risk assets bounce higher. In the press conference, Chair Powell sounded upbeat on the economy, reiterating his now familiar message of data-dependence and patience. He did note cross-current headwinds from the slowdown in Chinese and European growth. On rates, Powell said the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat. On the balance sheet, Powell said the policy will be driven by reserve demand, which he suggested was higher than it was a year ago. He also suggested that it was still not the Fed&#39;s primary tool of normalisation, that remains rates, though the balance sheet could be used if required (he later said that in a future downturn, the balance sheet would be used to stimulate the economy, but after using rates). He was quizzed about the ideal size of the balance sheet, though he dismissed the question, suggesting the size will be whatever is most efficient to implement the Fed&#39;s policy. Powell said rates were now in the range of estimates of neutral; previously he had seen them in the bottom end of the range of the estimates neutral. On the government shutdown, Powell said that it would leave an &quot;imprint&quot; on Q1 growth, though much of that would be made up in the Q2. On trade talks, Powell said that drawn out negotiations could weigh on business confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP</strong> reported 213k nonfarm payrolls additions, beating expectations of 178k, which Moody&rsquo;s Zandi analysed as evidence of the &ldquo;job market weather[ing] the government shutdown well. Despite the severe disruptions, businesses continued to add aggressively to their payrolls&rdquo;. Analysts at Pantheon digested this print as &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; and a &ldquo;healthy-looking gain&rdquo;. They did note, however that ADP likely overstates NFP&rsquo;s print as ADP is generated by &ldquo;a model which incorporates lagged official data&rdquo;. Pantheon added that they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t say for sure how big this effect was, because ADP does not release its model&rdquo;, and given the small error in their ADP forecast (220k) they have left their 180k prediction for NFP unchanged as &ldquo;labour demand remains extremely strong, despite the pressure on the manufacturing sector from China&rsquo;s slowdown and the trade war; manufacturing accounts for only 8.4% of U.S. payrolls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Trade: </strong>Limited updates on trade were heard today other than Nikkei reporting that the US-China trade talks began with a focus on financial liberalisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Following UK Parliament&rsquo;s vote for the Brady amendment yesterday, giving PM May the mandate to reopen the withdrawal agreement with the EU, the responses from the EU have been rather cut-throat. EU Council President Tusk, Commission President Juncker and other EU officials all reiterated their stance that the WA is not to be reopened or renegotiated, with the EU government seeing the likelihood of an extension &ldquo;ever more likely&rdquo;. In the UK, May met with the opposition leader Corbyn where they reportedly had a &ldquo;detailed&rdquo; conversation regarding the customs union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.96 HIGHER AT USD 54.23/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.33 HIGHER AT USD 61.65/BBL. </strong>Oil prices were higher on Wednesday amid ongoing threat of further US sanctions on Venezuela as well as oil output and exports cuts eyed by Saudi Arabia next month.&nbsp; Citi notes &ldquo;the market also seems to have accepted the idea that an increase in US petroleum inventories for last week wasn&rsquo;t enough to undercut support&rdquo; as the EIA crude stocks reported a smaller than expected build, confirming the API report last night. In terms of news flow, Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there are no plans for an extra-ordinary meeting for a global oil output cut deal over Venezuela while noting that Russian oil output will decline by 50k BPD in Jan vs. October 2018 levels, and will try to cut oil production by around 50k BPD in February. Also, refinery disruptions have added to the bullish sentiment; Citgo has curbed production at its 167k BPD Lemont, Illinois refinery due to extreme weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.56% at 2681, NASDAQ +2.64% at 6808, DJI +1.77% at 25014. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +1.35%, Materials +1.05%, Industrials +1.56%, Cons Discretionary +2.17%, Cons Staples +0.74%, Healthcare +1.37%, Financials +0.47%, Tech +3.03%, Telecoms +1.22%, Utilities +0.65%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) pushed indices higher today after a beat on top and bottom line estimates, an increase in its services margin and posted strong sales for its iPad and Mac products. Alibaba (BABA) opened in the green after beating EPS estimates and citing little effect from trade tensions on the co. Other notable companies reporting today were Boeing (BA), General Dynamics (GD), Stryker (SYK) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) who all beat on EPS and revenue estimates, seeing them outperform on the open. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged after its earnings, where it missed on revenue estimates but analysts attributing the miss not as gloomy as competitor NVIDIA (NVDA) had previously painted for the semiconductor space. McDonalds (MCD) traded higher on the open after strong EPS and comparable sales but pared back gains later after citing struggles in the US in its conference call. Amgen (AMGN) underperformed on the back of lowering its 2019 guidance. Israel-based Mellanox (MLNX) outperformed as Intel (INTC) bid USD 5.5bln-6bln for the co. in a cash and stock deal. Citigroup (C) found relief following regulators dropping plans of fining the bank for discriminatory mortgage lending. General Electric (GE) traded higher after announcing it was combining renewable and grid assets into one unit as well as seeing bidding interest for its Capital Aviation Services. Allergan (AGN) and Whirlpool (WHR) underperformed following downgrades at Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital respectively. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) benefitted from a New Buy initiation at Goldman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 122-00. </strong>Treasury futures drifted lower in earlier trade into the US equity open - exacerbated by a stronger than expected ADP report at 213K &ndash; before the trading range bound until the FOMC decision. The Fed took a dovish stance, removing references to gradual rate hikes and also mentioned its openness to tweaking the balance sheet runoff, as of such, treasuries caught a large bid with the front end leading causing steepening across the curve; the 2/30 seeing the greatest steepening at c.7bps. Elsewhere, the US Treasury announced next week it will sell USD 38bln in 3yr, USD 27bln in 10yr and USD 19bln in 30yr; to raise USD 29.9bln in new cash; as expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: &nbsp;</strong>On the much awaited FOMC rate decision, the Dollar weakened and printed fresh lows at 95.246 amid dovish tweaks in the latest FOMC statement and Fed&rsquo;s Powell stance shifting more dovish; at the press conference he stressed data-dependency and suggested that rates are now in the range of estimates of neutral. The DXY consolidated just off session lows at around 95.380.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD: </strong>The Aussie built build on gains above 0.7250 vs its US rival falling victim of USD weakness. The Cad has not really been ruffled by benign Canadian average weekly earnings but struggles towards 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK:</strong> Also benefiting from the ongoing rebound in crude, but also further weakness or underperformance in the SEK following deteriorations in Swedish business and consumer sentiment. Eur/Nok now down through 9.7000, and sub-9.6900 at one stage vs Eur/Sek close to 10.4000 at the high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Back to pretty flat on the day, but still holding above initial post-UK Parliamentary Brexit vote lows as Cable continues to derive tech support above its 200 DMA (1.3055) and Eur/Gbp is capped ahead of 0.8750. Next up for the Pound, a call between PM May and EC&rsquo;s Tusk in wake of last night&rsquo;s Brady amendment approval that gives her the mandate to go back to Brussels and attempt to replace the Irish backstop with some kind of alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY/CHF:</strong> Marked underperformers as the Jpy finally broke down and out of its recent range base of 109.50, though a couple of HMAs on its way to 109.73, while the Franc weakened further before finding some underlying bids/support near parity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency has topped out around 1.1450 vs the Dollar again, and perhaps belatedly in response to more soft Eurozone macro indicators in the form or German CPI and a pronounced drop in French household spending. Sitting above 1.1480 in post-FOMC trade.</p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Heading into the FOMC&rsquo;s rate decision and statement, the market was looking for an update on the balance sheet, whether the Fed would maintain a &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; pace of rate hikes, whether it judges the balance of risks as &ldquo;roughly balanced&rdquo; and whether it revises its assessment of the economy. All of those factors saw dovish tweaks in the latest statement: on the balance sheet, the FOMC indicated that it was prepared to adjust the pace of the balance sheet run-off, it dumped language on &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; rate hikes, adding in that the Committee will be &ldquo;patient&rdquo; on future hikes. The language around &ldquo;roughly balanced&rdquo; risks was also dumped, and it downgraded its view of the economy slightly, now characterising it as &ldquo;solid&rdquo; from &ldquo;strong&rdquo;. The Fed also changed its view on inflation, which it now sees as &ldquo;muted&rdquo;. There were some fears among traders that the Fed might not be as dovish as hoped for; that fear was jettisoned with the release of the statement, and the dovish Fed was risk assets bounce higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the press conference, Chair Powell sounded upbeat on the economy, reiterating his now familiar message of data-dependence and patience. He did note cross-current headwinds from the slowdown in Chinese and European growth. On rates, Powell said the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat. On the balance sheet, Powell said the policy will be driven by reserve demand, which he suggested was higher than it was a year ago. He also suggested that it was still not the Fed&#39;s primary tool of normalisation, that remains rates, though the balance sheet could be used if required (he later said that in a future downturn, the balance sheet would be used to stimulate the economy, but after using rates). He was quizzed about the ideal size of the balance sheet, though he dismissed the question, suggesting the size will be whatever is most efficient to implement the Fed&#39;s policy. Powell said rates were now in the range of estimates of neutral; previously he had seen them in the bottom end of the range of the estimates neutral. On the government shutdown, Powell said that it would leave an &quot;imprint&quot; on Q1 growth, though much of that would be made up in the Q2. On trade talks, Powell said that drawn out negotiations could weigh on business confidence.</p>\r\n",

Also, refinery disruptions have added to the bullish sentiment; Citgo has curbed production at its 167k BPD Lemont, Illinois refinery due to extreme weather.</p>\r\n",

However, we suspect a combination of short covering and hedging against a less dovish Fed than many anticipate or are just hoping for. The DXY has pared losses from just under 95.700 to almost 96.000, but not quite and looking for further prompts from the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aussie is off best levels having failed to build on gains above 0.7200 vs its US rival and seriously challenge a near term upside chart level just beyond the big figure (0.7207), but remains ahead in the G10 ranks, albeit closely followed and almost eclipsed by the Loonie. The catalysts, firmer than forecast Q4 Australian CPI data overnight, higher iron ore and oil prices. Note, the Cad has not really been ruffled by benign Canadian average weekly earnings as it extends recovery gains towards 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also benefiting from the ongoing rebound in crude, but also further weakness or underperformance in the SEK following deteriorations in Swedish business and consumer sentiment. Eur/Nok now down through 9.7000, and sub-9.6900 at one stage vs Eur/Sek close to 10.4000 at the high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to pretty flat on the day, but still holding above initial post-UK Parliamentary Brexit vote lows as Cable continues to derive tech support above its 200 DMA (1.3055) and Eur/Gbp is capped ahead of 0.8750. Next up for the Pound, a call between PM May and EC&rsquo;s Tusk in wake of last night&rsquo;s Brady amendment approval that gives her the mandate to go back to Brussels and attempt to replace the Irish backstop with some kind of alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marked underperformers as the Jpy finally broke down and out of its recent range base of 109.50, though a couple of HMAs on its way to 109.73, while the Franc weakened further before finding some underlying bids/support near parity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has topped out around 1.1450 vs the Dollar again, and perhaps belatedly in response to more soft Eurozone macro indicators in the form or German CPI and a pronounced drop in French household spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the Lira and Peso, as hawkish rhetoric from the CBRT supported the Try&rsquo;s rebound from 5.3200+ vs the Usd, but the Mxn weakened from circa 19.0000 to 19.2100 in wake of a Mexican GDP miss and the earlier Pemex credit downgrade.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were both subdued although strength across commodities just about kept the Australian benchmark afloat, while Tokyo stocks were weighed by currency effects and uninspiring corporate updates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) declined at the open amid broad weakness in the region and with China Life Insurance shares heavily pressured after it flagged a 50%-70% drop in FY net, although Chinese markets then rebounded off lows amid a non-committal tone ahead of the looming US-China trade talks and after the PBoC injected liquidity for the 1st time in 8 days. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices stuck to within this week&rsquo;s tight range amid the indecision seen across the region and with an unchanged BoJ Rinban announcement largely ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 14-day reverse repos.

Benefitting from sterling effects the FTSE 100 (+1.2%) is the outperforming index, with Burberry (+2.5%) in the green in sympathy with LVMH (+6.3%) after their earnings; and stating they are cautiously confident regarding 2019. Other luxury names such as Kering (+3.4%), Christian Dior (+4.0%) and Pandora (+2.0%) are also up in sympathy with LVMH. Sectors are mixed with outperformance in consumer discretionaries and some underperformance in telecom names. Other notable movers include Atos (+8.1%) who, following their earnings and 2019 guidance confirmation, are at the top of the Stoxx 600. Elsewhere, Novartis (-1.2%) are down following results, where the Co. missed on Q4 sales and operating income, as are Siemens (-1.5%) after their Q1 revenue came in just under expectations; Co. also stating they have made no further concessions on the Alstom (-0.5%) merger and will not pursue it at all costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Firmer than expected Australian Q4 CPI data has helped to revive a flagging Aud/Usd, with the pair back up on the 0.7200 handle and close to daily chart resistance around 0.7207, while Aud/Nzd has rebounded firmly over 1.0500, as the Kiwi continues to meet offers around 0.6850 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The next best G10 currency, as initial post-UK Parliamentary Brexit vote downside is reversed to an extent in Cable and Eur/Gbp, with the former reclaiming 1.3100+ status and perhaps deriving some respite from a bounce ahead of the 200 DMA (circa 1.3055). Meanwhile, the cross has recoiled relatively sharply from fresh peaks just shy of 0.8760 towards 0.8715, and perhaps the bulk of noted month end buying interest has now been transacted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Another major &lsquo;outperformer&rsquo;, or at least holding a firmer line vs its US counterpart within a 1.3235-85 range, and still cushioned by the recuperation in crude prices. Ahead, perhaps a little independent impetus via Canadian average weekly earnings data, but in truth this pales against the sheer volume of US releases on tap, and of course the impending FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR - Both flat to a tad softer vs the Dollar, and very confined in the run up to the Fed, as Usd/Jpy continues oscillate between 109.00-50 amidst undulations in broad risk sentiment, and the single currency remains entrenched in a 1.1400-50 band (with the topside also &lsquo;protected&rsquo; by the 200 DMA around 1.1444).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/SEK - The Franc and Krona have extended recent losses/underperformance/retracements, with the Chf perhaps undermined by weaker than forecast Swiss KoF and ZEW sentiment surveys, while the Sek will not have been helped by declines in consumer and industrial confidence that will merely keep the Riksbank on the back-burner. Usd/Chf is hovering above 0.9950 and Eur/Sek just below 10.3900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and Greenback overall looking to the Fed for more direction, as the DXY meanders between 95.875-682.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts are both back on an even keel after forging fresh intraday lows at 164.99 and 123.07 respectively earlier, and the 2 EU benchmarks now look set to bide time until US participants arrive for FOMC day. US Treasuries are a fraction underwater, and with the curve incrementally steeper after yesterday&rsquo;s mild flattening, as the Fed looms following a veritable deluge of data and the Quarterly Refunding details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.6%) and WTI (+0.7%) prices are firmer as the complex reacts to the smaller than expected build in yesterday&rsquo;s API Crude Stocks alongside reports that Saudi Arabia are planning on further oil production cuts and exports next month; additionally, believing that SPR releases are a solution to the US&rsquo;s Venezuela oil shortage problem. Follows sanctions announced on Monday which aim to stop the proceeds from PDVSA&rsquo;s crude exports of around 500,00 BPD to the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is trading in the middle of its USD 6/oz range, on a steady dollar ahead of today&rsquo;s FOMC decision.

GBP/USD attempted to nurse some of the losses seen following the voting in Parliament, where UK lawmakers accepted Brady&#39;s amendment for the backstop to be replaced with an alternative arrangement, and accepted Spelman&#39;s amendment that expressed objection to a no-deal Brexit. This effectively weighed on the GBP/USD considering the EU have remained adamant the withdrawal agreement or backstop was not up for renegotiation, while lawmakers also rejected the 5 other amendments including those involving delaying the Brexit date. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies were eventually supported by an intraday recovery in sentiment with AUD/USD the outperformer after firmer than expected CPI data which pushed the pair within a whisker of the 0.7200 handle and lifted AUD/NZD to above 1.0500, while USD/JPY was constrained by the indecisive risk appetite and CNY continued its recent strengthening trend after another firmer fix by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.4%).

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were both subdued although strength across commodities just about kept the Australian benchmark afloat, while Tokyo stocks were weighed by currency effects and uninspiring corporate updates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) declined at the open amid broad weakness in the region and with China Life Insurance shares heavily pressured after it flagged a 50%-70% drop in FY net, although Chinese markets then rebounded off lows amid a non-committal tone ahead of the looming US-China trade talks and after the PBoC injected liquidity for the 1st time in 8 days. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices stuck to within this week&rsquo;s tight range amid the indecision seen across the region and with an unchanged BoJ Rinban announcement largely ignored.</p>\r\n",
