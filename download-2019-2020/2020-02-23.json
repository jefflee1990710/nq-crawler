The Treasury curve bull-flattened on Friday, and 30-year yields fell to a fresh record low sub-1.90%; 10-year yields are also firmly sub-1.50%, now eying last year's low just beneath 1.43%. Some desks have noted that the cash yield on Treasuries and the cash yield on stocks is near the widest in around three decades, yet bonds continue to find buyers; some have explained this dynamic by pointing to growth slowing in Q1 2020, and scepticism that inflation will pick-up. Investors will therefore be keeping a close eye on next week's PCE report on Friday. The coronavirus is not concerning Fed offials just yet (although it is clearly a concern at the BOJ), and policymakers have generally given a nod to the December SEP projections which foresee an unchanged FFR in 2020; and in terms of the data, investors will put more stock into the manufacturing ISM due on 2nd March, and other regional manufacturing surveys next week. With that said, markets have added to expectations of Fed easing in 2020, with 47.5bps of easing priced through the end of this year (it was around 38bps a week ago).</p><p><strong>* SPX closes -1.1% at 3336, Dow closes -0.8% at 9573, Nasdaq 100 -1.9% at 9447.</strong> Coca-Cola Company (KO) announced the coronavirus would impact its current quarter earnings by 0.01-0.02/shr but continues to expect to achieve its FY guidance numbers.
