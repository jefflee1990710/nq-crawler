The overall bias was initially for equity strength, although gains reversed heading into the close; NDX remained positive after decent earnings from KLAC and DLG GY in Europe; SPX struggled. In the tail end of trade, the selling pressure came amidst comments from Trump noting “China may or may not keep the trade deal” while reports suggest the ECB is divided on who will respond to the German Court’s request. AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) won US antitrust approval for its pending purchase of Allergan (AGN) in a USD 63bln deal. Uber (UBER) is to reduce its workforce by 14% and hints at more cuts to come. Gilead (GILD) announced it was in discussions with chemical and drug manufacturers to produce remdesivir for Europe, Asia, and the developing world through to at least 2022. Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly never interested in selling following discreet inquiries about a purchase from Silver Lake, according to the WSJ. Disney (DIS) missed on EPS, beat on revenue, though announced Disney+ subscribers hit 54.5mln, note it hit 50mln early April and has a target of 90mln within 5-years (for reference, NFLX currently has 180mln subscribers). General Motors (GM) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, announced it is restricted from paying dividends if borrowings under facilities exceed USD 5.0bln. Quarterly worldwide vehicle sales 1.457mln (vs 1.878mln Y/Y) US vehicle sales 618k (vs 666k Y/Y) Total North America vehicle sales 719k (vs 775k Y/Y). SPX -0.7% at 2848, NDX +0.6% at 8985, DJIA -0.9% at 23,665.</p><p>The TPLEX saw pronounced bear steepening after the US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement came in above many expectations, particularly in the longer-dated tenors, in addition to further chunky corporate issuance volumes. Expectations had been raised heading into the refunding announcement after the Treasury’s financing estimates were released Monday; however, the size of issuance has exceeded expectations, and as a result, yields rose, seeing the 10-year yield comfortably rise above 70bps, although gravitated back towards the figure in the latter part of the session. Analysts also suggested that the lack of 4-year or 6-year announcement in the headlines seems to suggest the play of curve steepening will likely continue as the Treasury extends the average maturity of its outstanding debt. TD’s analysts noted, “USTs will need more setup into the auctions next week, which should steepen the curve and underperform OIS and swaps (i.e., tighter swap spreads).” The raised issuance naturally draws attention onto the Fed, and whether it will be able to continue tapering purchases as it has been if the market lets yields rise further. TD believes the Fed will ultimately rise to the challenge given that growth is unlikely to rebound, “But the Fed’s “pain point” may be higher rates with better Treasury market functioning and easier financial conditions.” By settlement today, 2s and 5s little changed at 0.18% and 0.38%, respectively, with 10s +5bps at 0.71%, and 30s +8bps at 1.41%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 10 ticks lower at 138-17.</p>",

The overall bias was initially for equity strength, although gains reversed heading into the close; NDX remained positive after decent earnings from KLAC and DLG GY in Europe; SPX struggled. In the tail end of trade, the selling pressure came amidst comments from Trump noting “China may or may not keep the trade deal” while reports suggest the ECB is divided on who will respond to the German Court’s request. The Treasury curve bear-steepened, but that was more a function of (even) higher than expected issuance which is coming in the quarter. The FX landscape was far more mixed, much of it dominated by the downside in EUR (data highlighted the challenges ahead, EC downgraded its forecasts, and a negative tone after yesterday’s German court ruling lingers) which helped the DXY climb above 100.00; JPY took advantage, with EURJPY down to three-year lows. Elsewhere, EMFX struggled to participate in the bouts of ‘risk-on’. Oil, meanwhile, was lower, with some desks suggesting that it was no longer a bargain (demand- and supply-side had positive catalysts today, however). Overall, there is a feeling that traders are waiting for the next catalyst to help us break out of some of the recent ranges – it is unlikely that will be seen over the coming days (jobless claims Thursday, NFP Friday likely to tell us more of what we know; US/China tensions to keep traders cautious). Traders will also be watching re-openings, with some noting that states that account for 40% of US GDP will re-open this week.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> US President Trump stated China may or may not keep the trade deal, adding he will be able to report on whether China is abiding by the Phase One trade deal in one week or two. Note, Trump has previously threatened tariffs if the obligations were not met, which was also a condition when the Phase One deal was signed. Elsewhere, Trump stated he believes US death toll figures, but he does not believe China's.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED:</strong> <strong>Fed's Kaplan (voter) </strong>stated the reopening of Texas will be very phased and gradual; reiterating he expects 25-30% annual decline in US GDP in Q2 and unemployment to peak at 20%. Kaplan added the Fed will need to run very accommodative monetary policy for an extended period of time. He also noted lending programmes are to credit-worthy companies, and highly leveraged companies concerned about insolvency won't be able to access them. <strong>Fed's Barkin (non-voter)</strong> reiterated Fed Chair Powell, noting the recovery will be slow; lawmakers will need to contemplate what more support might be needed, and he warned the US might have unemployed workers for longer than thought.</p><p><strong>ECB:</strong> The ECB is reportedly divided on who will respond to the German court's request, according to FT, who note ECB is set to resist court order to justify bond purchases. Several members suggested the Bundesbank could deal with it alone. This report echoed earlier source reports and was in fitting with comments from ECB’s Villeroy who noted the dangers around criticising the ECB’s independence and price stability focus. Villeroy noted the ECB will be as flexible as required, especially to avoid Euro-area fragmentation and in terms of instruments, the ECB will be as innovative as necessary. Elsewhere, ECB’s Weidmann noted Central Banks must do their part to stabilise the economy during a crisis, but its important to get out of crisis mode when the economy picks up, adding the ECB's bond-buying programme and extraordinary policy measures were necessary.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>Interest rates are expected to be held at their lower bound of 0.1% with focus instead on potential adjustments to the MPC’s bond-buying operations. Consensus looks for Gilt purchases to be held at GBP 625bln and corporates at GBP 20bln for a total envelope of GBP 645bln; note there are some outside bets for Gilt purchases to be increased by GBP100-200bln. Analysts at RBC look for an addition of GBP 200bln in bond purchases, albeit the bank believes that June 18th could be a more likely time horizon for the MPC to act. ING note that purchases remain below the current ceiling of GBP 645bln and will likely remain so for another two months. However, the BoE will need to consider how it will absorb increased issuance from the DMO.

Typically, the May meeting is not accompanied by forecasts or a press conference; however, due to the cancellation of the March 18th meeting, this month’s gathering will include both a press conference and new forecasts. As such, focus will predominantly be on any alterations to the rate path as it is heavily outdated and inaccurate; desks are conflicted as to whether it will project rates unchanged at 0.25% ahead or price in some mild easing given recent communication. Click <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24464/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">here</a> for the full preview.</p><p><strong>BCB:</strong> Brazilian Central Bank are expected to cut its Selic rate by 0.5% to 3.25% with all analysts surveyed by Reuters expecting the BCB to cut, although some are expecting a deeper 75bp cut. The real has weakened significantly this year amid mass EM outflows due to COVID-19 while Bolsonaro has been under scrutiny recently after firing the Health Secretary amid the pandemic and ignoring the supreme court when deciding to hire a family friend as the new chief of police, adding to political woes. Policymakers in Brazil have floated the idea of impeachment, although House Speaker Maia noted this is something which must be assessed carefully. The BCB has intervened numerous times with USD swap auctions to help stem the losses of the BRL, but the Real has continued to print fresh record lows against a rising dollar. Credit Suisse lie in the 50bp cut pack and believe the inflation environment is more favourable since the previous meeting, highlighting how inflation expectations in Brazil have fallen dramatically to 2.2% from 3.1% this year, and to 3.4% from 3.65% in 2021; both beneath the bank's inflation targets of 4 and 3.75%, respectively; 2022 expectations remain in line with the BCB’s forecast range. Credit Suisse conclude “we expect the monetary authority to maintain the possibility of further cuts in the Selic interest rate if the scenario for inflation for 2020 and 2021 remains favourable”. Any further commentary on FX intervention will also be eyed.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>Quarterly Refunding: US Treasury to offer USD 96bln of Treasury Securities (exp. 91bln, prev. 84bln):</strong></p><ul><li>3-year size: 42bln (prev.

Expectations had been raised heading into the refunding announcement after the Treasury’s financing estimates were released Monday; however, the size of issuance has exceeded expectations, and as a result, yields rose, seeing the 10-year yield comfortably rise above 70bps, although gravitated back towards the figure in the latter part of the session. Analysts also suggested that the lack of 4-year or 6-year announcement in the headlines seems to suggest the play of curve steepening will likely continue as the Treasury extends the average maturity of its outstanding debt. TD’s analysts noted, “USTs will need more setup into the auctions next week, which should steepen the curve and underperform OIS and swaps (i.e., tighter swap spreads).” The raised issuance naturally draws attention onto the Fed, and whether it will be able to continue tapering purchases as it has been if the market lets yields rise further. TD believes the Fed will ultimately rise to the challenge given that growth is unlikely to rebound, “But the Fed’s “pain point” may be higher rates with better Treasury market functioning and easier financial conditions.” By settlement today, 2s and 5s little changed at 0.18% and 0.38%, respectively, with 10s +5bps at 0.71%, and 30s +8bps at 1.41%.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 0.57 LOWER AT 23.99/BBL, WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 0.87 LOWER AT USD 25.62/BBL; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 1.25 LOWER AT USD 29.72/BBL</strong></p><p>Front-month crude futures broke their five-day rally (six-day for Brent) as sentiment in the energy complex turned overnight, in lack of major fundamental catalysts. Tuesday’s rally brought prices to levels not last seen since April 15th, although failed to sustain such today. The latest US energy inventories were mixed, where the headline crude stocks printed a build of 4.6mln bbls, almost half the size of the build expected, and less pronounced than the private inventory data on Tuesday night had indicated – prices will likely need to see the declining rate of builds switch back into draws to find further support – although the Cushing hub printed a sizeable 2mln bbl build. Elsewhere in the EIA report, gasoline stocks printed a surprise draw of 3.2mln, while distillates printed a chunky 9.5mln bbl build; production fell by 200k BPD to 11.9mln BPD.</p><p><strong>OPEC: </strong>Sources reported that Russian oil &amp; gas output has fallen to 9.5mln BPD between May 1-5; note, Russia’s crude output is capped at 8.5mln BPD under the OPEC++ deal. Russian Energy Minister Novak spoke also, saying the recovery in oil demand is not seen to be happening fast, saying the global oil demand decline has now eased to 21.5-27mln BPD from 30mln BPD. Novak also said that some countries, where international majors work, may have difficulties sticking to oil deal targets, but said Russia will achieve its output cut quickly, at the same time it will be able to restore output quickly. Meanwhile, sources reported Iraq is yet to inform regular oil buyers of cuts to exports, where discussions with international Co’s on oil cuts are yet to be finalised; the sources noted that talks have not hit a deadlock, with a breakthrough expected to be reached soon.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p>ADP: ADP reported 20.236mln jobs were shed from the US economy in April, close to the consensus view looking for -20mln; analysts had noted the uncertainty heading into the release, which had left expectations wide. It is difficult to read too much into the data, given much of the gloom had been signalled by other metrics in advance (primarily, the more timely weekly initial jobless claims data), and as such, the data merely confirms what the market was already discounting (hence the muted reaction in asset prices). In terms of the breakdown, Capital Economics notes that job losses came predominantly in the services sector, though the health care sector was hit as well. CapEco notes that the report is a bit light on details of any potential methodological problems this month: “The ADP counts anyone on the active payroll rather than just people who were paid during the month, which is the official non-farm payroll definition,” and with many folks temporarily laid off, “that could have created a discrepancy, with those people still on the active payroll, but not counted in the official non-farm payroll figures and also qualifying as unemployed in the other official household survey.” The takeaway, Capital Economics says, is that the official BLS print on Friday might look even worse than the ADP report implies. Currently, the consensus looks for -21.9mln (though this may be revised ahead of the release), and the jobless rate is seen jumping to 16.0% from 4.4%. The narrative on Friday may be focusing around the ‘largest monthly fall ever’ line.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.7% at 2848, NDX +0.6% at 8985, DJIA -0.9% at 23,665</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Information Technology +0.7%, Discretionary +0.3%, Health Care -1%, Communications -1.1%, Staples -1.1%, Industrials -1.4%, Materials -1.8%, Real Estate -1.8%, Financials -2.3%, Energy -2.6%, Utilities -3.5%</p><p>STOCK SPECIFICS: AbbVie Inc.

Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly never interested in selling following discreet inquiries about a purchase from Silver Lake, according to the WSJ.</p><p>EARNINGS: Disney (DIS) missed on EPS, beat on revenue, though announced Disney+ subscribers hit 54.5mln, note it hit 50mln early April and has a target of 90mln within 5-years (for reference, NFLX currently has 180mln subscribers). General Motors (GM) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, announced it is restricted from paying dividends if borrowings under facilities exceed USD 5.0bln. Quarterly worldwide vehicle sales 1.457mln (vs 1.878mln Y/Y) US vehicle sales 618k (vs 666k Y/Y) Total North America vehicle sales 719k (vs 775k Y/Y). KLA-Tencor (KLAC) printed a beat on EPS and revenue, while guidance fell in line with expectations. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) saw solid figures, beating top and bottom line, with the beats driven by strong Call of Duty sales; also raised guidance. Electronic Arts (EA) beat on EPS and revenue but provided cautious guidance. MecardoLibre (MELI) saw top and bottom-line beats.</p><p>AIRLINES: US airlines are reportedly burning more than USD 10bln of cash per month, according to a Congressional testimony by Airlines for America (A4a) seen by newswires. The Testimony said that airlines were at risk of bankruptcy if they are forced to refund non-refundable tickets, or those cancelled by passengers. The testimony also claimed that airlines have grounded over 3,000 aircraft, which amounts to nearly 50% of active fleets.</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The DXY reclaimed 100.00 to the upside supported by a tumbling Euro. While macro risk sentiment overall was mixed, in the FX space there wasn’t any risk-on signal, with cyclical/high-beta FX and EM’s lagging, the Dollar bid, although elsewhere US yields and equities were mixed. Despite a continued bout of poor data, ADP -20mln, participants continue to look through the readings and towards the reopening of economies/medical updates. Fedspeak as of recent has been very repetitive although comments from Vice Chair Clarida yesterday signalled some caution, while Evans hinted at YCC and Bullard reiterated rates are likely to remain low for years, not months.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The yen has been performing well despite a steeper Treasury curve, where rate differentials have moved in the dollar’s favour. EURJPY is also noteworthy, falling to a 3-year low today (data that highlights the weak European economy, grim EC forecasts, and lingering concerns after yesterday’s German court decision). EURJPY is sub-115 to 114.44 at the lows today aided by EUR weakness. NOTE: Some of the yen price action might be influenced by the Golden Week holiday, with Asian players away. Technicians at JPMorgan highlighted support in USDJPY at 106.10/20, a level which has recently given way with the psychological 106.00 holding for now; beneath here, the 105.15-25 region comes into focus, JPM says.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency continues to decline after the German Court Ruling yesterday with a set of bleak economic forecasts from the European Commission only adding to EUR stress. MUFG highlighted EURUSD was already vulnerable to see weakness as the desk expected upside risks to the dollar to outweigh the EUR in the short term, while the latest decision from Germany only undermines sentiment further.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, NZD):</strong> With risk sentiment mixed, cyclicals lagged amid broad dollar strength as DXY reclaimed 100. GBP, however, was an underperformer ahead of tomorrow’s (early, 7am) BoE rate decision, although not much is expected. On the fiscal front, Chancellor Sunak is reportedly preparing to wind down the government wage programme as a gradual reopen looks set to be announced this week, with Sunak expected to announce his plans as restrictions are eased.&nbsp; NZD underperformed its Antipodean counterpart, but downside was halted just ahead of the 0.60 figure, meanwhile, AUDUSD remained above 0.64.</p><p><strong>PETRO-CURRENCIES (CAD, RUB, MXN):</strong> Oil exporters traded weaker today as oil prices dropped, which saw USDCAD higher, combined with dollar strength, reclaiming 1.41 to the upside; analysts highlighting the higher correlation between CAD price action and Oil price action in recent days. Scotiabank expects the cross to continue to trade in a wide range and choppy around 1.40 in the short term. RUB was heavily weaker today as it has largely been tracking crude prices in recent weeks, although some positive news from the CBR that inflation expectations have stabilised among households. MXN also saw heavy declines today while analysts are paying attention to a Citibanamex survey ahead of tomorrow’s inflation report. The survey saw the median April inflation expectations at -1% M/M and 0.32% for the core print. Credit Suisse highlights that the core print implies annual core inflation of 3.5%, down from 3.6% previously. The desk expects to see a non-core print bi-weekly of +0.5% in H2 of this month, due to firmer agricultural prices, particularly due to issued in Mexico City’s main wholesale market.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was generally weaker, not participating in even the fleeting bouts of risk rallies, with BRL underperforming following Fitch cutting its outlook on the nation to negative from stable, although affirmed the rating at BB-. Participants will be eyeing the latest rate decision tonight (primer above). The TRY saw similar weakness to the Real, amid falling central bank reserves, with no solace found despite commentary from its economy minister that the reserves are adequate, although he reportedly suggested capital controls are not planned.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The TPLEX saw pronounced bear steepening after the US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement came in above many expectations, particularly in the longer-dated tenors, in addition to further chunky corporate issuance volumes. Expectations had been raised heading into the refunding announcement, after the Treasury’s financing estimates released Monday; however, the size of issuance has exceeded expectations, and as a result, yields rose, seeing the 10-year yield comfortably rise above 70bps, although gravitated back towards the figure in the latter part of the session. Analysts also suggested that the lack of 4-year or 6-year announcement in the headlines seems to suggest the play of curve steepening will likely continue as the Treasury extends the average maturity of its outstanding debt. TD’s analysts noted “USTs will need more setup into the auctions next week, which should steepen the curve and underperform OIS and swaps (i.e., tighter swap spreads).” The raised issuance naturally draws attention onto the Fed, and whether it will be able to continue tapering purchases as it has been if the market lets yields rise further. TD believes the Fed will ultimately rise to the challenge given that growth is unlikely to rebound, “But the Fed’s “pain point” may be higher rates with better Treasury market functioning and easier financial conditions.” By settlement today, 2s and 5s little changed at 0.18% and 0.38%, respectively, with 10s +5bps at 0.71%, and 30s +8bps at 1.41%.</p><p><strong>Quarterly Refunding: US Treasury to offer USD 96bln of Treasury Securities (exp. 91bln, prev. 84bln):</strong></p><ul><li>3-year size: 42bln (prev.

Novak also said that some countries, where international majors work, may have difficulties sticking to oil deal targets, but said Russia will achieve its output cut quickly, at the same time it will be able to restore output quickly. Meanwhile, sources reported Iraq is yet to inform regular oil buyers of cuts to exports, where discussions with international Co’s on oil cuts are yet to be finalised; the sources noted that talks have not hit a deadlock, with a breakthrough expected to be reached soon. &nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD</strong>: The DXY reclaimed 100.00 to the upside supported by a tumbling Euro. While macro risk sentiment overall was mixed, in the FX space there wasn’t any risk-on signal, with cyclical/high-beta FX and EM’s lagging, the Dollar bid, although elsewhere US yields and equities were mixed. Despite a continued bout of poor data, ADP -20mln, participants continue to look through the readings and towards the reopening of economies/medical updates. Fedspeak as of recent has been very repetitive although comments from Vice Chair Clarida yesterday signalled some caution, while Evans hinted at YCC and Bullard reiterated rates are likely to remain low for years, not months.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The yen has been performing well despite a steeper Treasury curve, where rate differentials have moved in the dollar’s favour. EURJPY is also noteworthy, falling to a 3-year low today (data that highlights the weak European economy, grim EC forecasts, and lingering concerns after yesterday’s German court decision). EURJPY is sub-115 to 114.44 at the lows today aided by EUR weakness. NOTE: Some of the yen price action might be influenced by the Golden Week holiday, with Asian players away. Technicians at JPMorgan highlighted support in USDJPY at 106.10/20, a level which has recently given way with the psychological 106.00 holding for now; beneath here, the 105.15-25 region comes into focus, JPM says.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The single currency continues to decline after the German Court Ruling yesterday with a set of bleak economic forecasts from the European Commission only adding to EUR stress. MUFG highlighted EURUSD was already vulnerable to see weakness as the desk expected upside risks to the dollar to outweigh the EUR in the short term, while the latest decision from Germany only undermines sentiment further.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, NZD)</strong>: With risk sentiment mixed, cyclicals lagged amid broad dollar strength as DXY reclaimed 100. GBP however was an underperformer ahead of tomorrow’s (early, 7am) BoE rate decision, although not much is expected. On the fiscal front, Chancellor Sunak is reportedly preparing to wind down the government wage programme as a gradual reopen looks set to be announced this week, with Sunak expected to announce his plans as restrictions are eased.&nbsp; NZD underperformed its Antipodean counterpart, but downside was halted just ahead of the 0.60 figure, meanwhile AUDUSD remained above 0.64.</p><p><strong>PETRO-CURRENCIES (CAD, RUB, MXN): </strong>Oil exporters traded weaker today as oil prices dropped, which saw USDCAD higher, combined with dollar strength, reclaiming 1.41 to the upside; analysts highlighting the higher correlation between CAD price action and Oil price action in recent days. Scotiabank expects the cross to continue to trade in a wide range and choppy around 1.40 in the short term. RUB was heavily weaker today as it has largely been tracking crude prices in recent weeks, although some positive news from the CBR that inflation expectations have stabilised among households. MXN also saw heavy declines today while analysts are paying attention to a Citibanamex survey ahead of tomorrow’s inflation report. The survey saw the median April inflation expectations at -1% M/M and 0.32% for the core print. Credit Suisse highlights that the core print implies annual core inflation of 3.5%, down from 3.6% previously. The desk expects to see a non-core print bi-weekly of +0.5% in H2 of this month, due to firmer agricultural prices, particularly due to issued in Mexico City’s main wholesale market.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was generally weaker, not participating in even the fleeting bouts of risk rallies, with BRL underperforming following Fitch cutting its outlook on the nation to negative from stable, although affirmed the rating at BB-. Participants will be eyeing the latest rate decision tonight (primer <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/bcb-primer-brazilian-central-bank-are-expected-to-cut-its-selic-rate-by-0-5-to-3-25-with-all-analysts-surveyed-by-reuters-expecting-the-bcb-to-cut-although-some-are-expecting-a-deeper-75bp-cut-06-05-2020\">here</a>). The TRY saw similar weakness to the Real, amid falling central bank reserves, with no solace found despite commentary from its economy minister that the reserves are adequate, although he reportedly suggested capital controls are not planned.</p>",

The Dollar remains resilient, or simply too well accustom to bad US data, and ADP topping 20 mn is another case in point, but in truth the index has gleaned more leverage from external impulses and ongoing weakness in major counterparts alongside depreciation in EM currencies amidst the latest downturn in risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>It’s a tight call for the undesirable tag of midweek G10 loser, but still in the balance between Sterling and the Loonie as the former extends declines vs the Greenback to 1.2345, just off trend-line chart support seen circa 1.2334, and even against the Euro with the cross now retesting resistance/offers ahead of 0.8750. Meanwhile, Usd/Cad has rebounded further from Tuesday’s lows near 1.4000 to a few pips shy of 1.4140 amidst a retreat in crude prices, with Brent back below Usd 30/brl from Usd 32+ at one stage and WTI recoiling from just over Usd 26 to sub-Usd 23.50.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/NZD</strong></p><p>Also on course to end Wednesday’s EU session down vs the Buck, albeit all off worst levels as the single currency stays within sight of 1.0800, Franc contains declines beyond 0.9750 to less than 10 pips and Kiwi retains a firm grasp of the 0.6000 handle in advance of NZ Q2 inflation expectations early on Thursday.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Left to its own devices, Yen strength against the grain and irrespective of typical factors that normally influence its value relative to the Dollar, like risk flows and a significantly steeper US Treasury yield curve, has been eye-catching. However, Usd/Jpy’s seemingly persistent descent towards 106.00 (and Eur/Jpy’s fall to multi-year lows to under 114.50) may come to an abrupt end when Japanese participants return from their Golden Week break amidst export hedging.</p><p><strong>AUD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The major outperformers or at least managing to weather the knock-on effects of Greenback gains at the expense of others, as the Aussie maintains 0.6400+ status into trade data, the Swedish Krona retains post-Riksbank hawkish hold momentum and Norwegian Crown awaits guidance/impetus from the Norges Bank tomorrow – see a preview of the May policy meeting and BoE super Thursday in the Newsquawk Research Suite.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Still no real respite for the Lira from latest efforts to stop the bear run via tighter bank transaction limits and an investor call from Turkey’s Economy and Finance Minister, with Usd/Try getting relentlessly closer to 7.2000 and the 7.2362 ATH, but the Rouble has also been rocked by the aforementioned retrenchment in oil along with a dire -33% output estimate due to the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the Real has depreciated further in wake of Fitch cutting Brazil’s outlook to negative and could be set for more downside if the BCB opts to cut the Selic rate by more than the 50 bp anticipated.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>There is a constructive tone to risk this morning, with ES futures flirting with the highs seen on Tuesday, however since the open gains have pared. Asian markets had a bias towards higher (ex-Australia), and major European equities are a touch better than neutral. The DXY has crossed 100 to the upside amid further softness in the EUR (German constitutional court decision yesterday, data that highlights the challenges ahead, and downbeat forecasts from the EC all contributing). However, EMFX is softer against the dollar; the PBOC’s yuan fix overnight (after China returned from market holidays) was judged neutral, which supported risk sentiment since there was a concern that the fixing may be aggressively moved to reflect US/China tensions resurfacing – it will be a key point to monitor as tensions heat up ahead of the November elections.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Sectors open mixed with Utilities and Energy lagging while technology outperforms with Communications. The latter performs well thanks to solid gains in Activision Blizzard (ATVI) after earnings yesterday, while Semiconductors (SOX) are buoying the tech sector after decent KLAC earnings, as well as solid figures from Germany’s Dialog Semiconductor (DLG GY).</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) won US antitrust approval for its pending purchase of Allergan (AGN) in a USD 63bln deal. Uber (UBER) is to reduce its workforce by 14% and hints at more cuts to come. Gilead (GILD) announced it was in discussions with chemical and drug manufacturers to produce remdesivir for Europe, Asia, and the developing world through to at least 2022. Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly never interested in selling following discreet inquiries about a purchase from Silver Lake, according to the WSJ.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Disney (DIS) missed on EPS, beat on revenue, though announced Disney+ subscribers hit 54.5mln, note it hit 50mln early April and has a target of 90mln within 5-years (for reference, NFLX currently has 180mln subscribers). General Motors (GM) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, announced it is restricted from paying dividends if borrowings under facilities exceed USD 5.0bln. Quarterly worldwide vehicle sales 1.457mln (vs 1.878mln Y/Y) US vehicle sales 618k (vs 666k Y/Y) Total North America vehicle sales 719k (vs 775k Y/Y). KLA-Tencor (KLAC) printed a beat on EPS and revenue, while guidance fell in line with expectations. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) saw solid figures, beating top and bottom line, with the beats driven by strong Call of Duty sales; also raised guidance. Electronic Arts (EA) beat on EPS and revenue but provided a cautious guidance. MecardoLibre (MELI) saw top and bottom-line beats.</p><p><strong>AIRLINES:</strong> US airlines are reportedly burning more than USD 10bln of cash per month, according to a Congressional testimony by Airlines for America (A4a) seen by newswires. The Testimony said that airlines were at risk of bankruptcy if they are forced to refund non-refundable tickets, or those cancelled by passengers. The testimony also claimed that airlines have grounded over 3,000 aircraft, which amounts to nearly 50% of active fleets.</p><p><strong>SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY: </strong>Naturally, the shape of the recovery will play a key role in how equities fair in the second part of the year. SocGen says markets are undecided on the shape of the recovery (the depth of earnings recession, and risk of a second coronavirus wave are key uncertainties), noting that options are implying a 68% probability that the S&amp;P 500 trades in a range of 2,100-3,500 by the end of the year. There is also uncertainty with regards to testing and developing a vaccine, which SocGen says explains why defensives and bond proxies have performed so well. The bank thinks that this opens the door to opportunities. “The current rally was driven by defensive/tech sectors, mostly through the duration call, unlike the previous recovery episodes in 2003 and 2009. Thus, further upside is possible should the market start to price a V-shaped scenario through a rotation into cyclicals.” In this optimistic scenario, SocGen sees the S&amp;P 500 range at 3,100-3,500 in 2H20, derived from its baseline scenario of peak contagion in 2Q and a gradual, orderly exit from lockdown paving the way for a V-shaped recovery in 2021 – this premise is not universally accepted by market participants, note, and the market is currently trading in line with a U-shaped scenario, the bank concedes.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://newsquawk.com/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/733aa1ee-feae-4c44-9253-f05374000540.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>THE NEXT CATALYST: </strong>There is a feeling on many desks that the current virus news, US/China, and electioneering may be embedded into the price of stocks, leaving markets in search of new catalysts, or significant progress on current themes, to justify multiple expansion/contraction. Citi said the silence is causing unease among its traders who were waiting for the next concrete catalyst to give markets some direction. Nonetheless, Citi says, assets appear to be reading no news as good news, with risk catching a bid this morning. In absence of fresh drivers, Citi said it will continue to mull re-openings.</p>",

CapEco notes that the report is a bit light on details of any potential methodological problems this month: “The ADP counts anyone on the active payroll rather than just people who were paid during the month, which is the official non-farm payroll definition,” and with many folks temporarily laid off, “that could have created a discrepancy, with those people still on the active payroll, but not counted in the official non-farm payroll figures and also qualifying as unemployed in the other official household survey.”</li><li>The takeaway, Capital Economics says, is that the official BLS print on Friday might look even worse than the ADP report implies. Currently, the consensus looks for -21.9mln (though this may be revised ahead of the release), and the jobless rate is seen jumping to 16.0% from 4.4%. The narrative on Friday may be focusing around the ‘largest monthly fall ever’ line.</li></ul>",

That being said, US equity futures continue their grind higher in EU trade. FTSE 100 (+0.6%) has been leading the gains across the region, potentially aided by a softer Sterling alongside the recovery in the energy markets. The cash index briefly dipped below its 38.2% Fib (move from 6151 to 5702) at 5873 to a low of 5838, before regaining a footing above the level. Sectors also see a mixed performance with no clear standouts or reflection of the current risk sentiment. The energy sector nursed earlier losses but remains a laggard alongside Consumer Discretionary. In terms of the breakdown, Travel &amp; Leisure resides at the bottom but does not see significant underperformance. In terms of individual movers, Dialog Semiconductor (+5.3%), ITV (+4%) and Hannover Re (+4.2%) are among the top post-earning gainers in the Stoxx 600, with the former also aiding the likes of Infineon (+4%) in sympathy. BMW (-3.1%) extends on losses after noting that the highest negative impact is expected in Q2 2020 and PBT is still predicted to be significantly lower. Wirecard (-1.5%) holds onto losses after a 4.4% stakeholder called for a board shakeup.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/GBP -</strong> Having held up relatively well when German factory orders fell around 50% more than forecast, the Euro couldn’t ignore single digit services PMIs in the Eurozone periphery or weaker than expected pan retail sales that accompanied bleak Spring economic projections from the EC. However, Eur/Usd has contained losses below 1.0800 unlike Cable that extended declines from circa 1.2450 through the 50 DMA (1.2411) and 1.2400 on the way to a new low for May around 1.2360. Some suspicions that a significantly worse than anticipated UK construction PMI was pressuring Sterling prior to the official release, while fix-related demand for Eur/Gbp was likely compounded by stops when the cross breached a key technical level in the form of the 200 DMA yet again (0.8722). Next up for the Pound, BoE super Thursday that kicks off at the unusually early time of 7.00BST and comes with the latest MPR and FSR.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar is revelling in the plight of others and fragile risk sentiment, with the DXY back on the 100.00 handle ahead of ADP that offers the first monthly US jobs data proxy for Friday’s NFP release, albeit not always a reliable indicator for the BLS headline number. From a technical perspective, 100.209 forms near term resistance for the index and represents pre-month end highs before the Greenback succumbed to the weight or rebalancing sales to hit a 98.645 low on May 1, and the peak so far is 100.200 vs 99.749 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD -</strong> The Franc has been caught in the cross-fire of Buck strength vs Euro weakness, as Usd/Chf hovers near 0.9750 in contrast to Eur/Chf trending back down towards 1.0500, while the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all paring gains vs their US counterpart, with Nzd/Usd retreating from 0.6072 in wake of mixed NZ jobs data overnight, Aud/Usd fading from 0.6451 after similar conflicting retail sales figures for March and Q1 overall, and Usd/Cad losing some crude attraction following a close test of 1.4000 yesterday on the back of a better Canadian trade balance compared to consensus and the US.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK - </strong>In contrast to the broad G10 trend, the Yen is outperforming and edging closer to 106.00, albeit still without the usual level/depth of domestic input given the final day of Golden Week ahead of tomorrow’s return from the extended holiday break. Similarly, the Scandinavian Crowns retain bullish momentum against the backdrop of widespread single currency depreciation that has seen Eur/Jpy trade at 3 year lows well under 115.00, with Eur/Sek testing 10.6200 and Eur/Nok sub-11.0900 at one stage in the run up to tomorrow’s Norges Bank policy meeting.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Usd/Try is extending its apparent unstoppable mission to revisit record highs at 7.2362 vs 7.1680 or so thus far today, even though Turkish banks are still selling the pair and the banking authority has tightened limits on trade with foreign institutions further in an attempt to stop the rally. Perhaps Treasury and Finance Minister Albayrak can turn the tide for the Lira via a conference call to global investors from 13.00GMT, but it’s seemingly a tall order. Elsewhere, the Real could fall prey to bears in the aftermath of Fitch downgrading Brazil’s BB- rating to negative amidst the rising political instability that has already propelled Usd/Brl beyond 5.5700.</p><p>Australian Retail Sales (Mar) M/M 8.5% vs. Exp. 8.2% (Prev. 0.5%). (Newswires) Australian Retail Sales (Q1) Q/Q 0.7% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 0.5%)</p><p>New Zealand Employment Change (Q1) Q/Q 0.7% Q/Q vs. Exp. -0.3% (Prev. 0.0%).

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Multi-covered cash auctions are far from rare and certainly common place in the case of UK Gilts from the DMO to date, but for a 5 year German offering, or any maturity for that matter is quite an achievement. However, Bobl futures remain below 136.00 and in negative territory alongside Bunds sub-174.00, albeit off lows of 135.78 and 173.89 respectively, while the 10 year UK benchmark has not been able to emulate Tuesday’s performance as 138.00 keeps rebounds from 137.81 in check. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are also under par with the curve a bit steeper pre-ADP and refunding details.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front month futures are back on the rise after some ovrnight consolidation from the prior day’s mammoth gains which saw the contracts settle north of USD 24.50/bbl and USD 30/bbl respectively – aided by the demand side of the equation looking brighter as global economies plan to come back online. Meanwhile, supply side issues appear to be tempering amid the OPEC+ pact, whilst sources also noted that Saudi’s May exports are expected to fall to around 6mln BPD vs. ~9.4mln BPD in April. Over in the US, Texas regulators decided against curtailing the state’s output of over 5mln BPD, albeit this was expected. WTI June resides just under USD 25.50/bbl and towards the middle of its current USD 24-26/bbl intraday band. Brent July meanders south of USD 32/bbl after waning off its USD 32.27/bbl overnight high. Spot gold remains in limbo within a tight USD 7/oz range amid an indecisive risk tone heading into key risk events later this week including the US Labour Market report. Copper meanwhile tracks the gains in US equity futures and sees some support after dipping below but failing to close below its 21 DMA for three consecutive sessions.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks +8.4mln vs. Exp.+7.8mln (Prev. 9.0mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs lowered expected US natgas production forecast levels for Summer 2020, Winter 2020 and Summer 2021, while it maintained the bearish stance on NYMEX gas this summer driven by storage constraints.

From a technical perspective, 100.209 forms near term resistance for the index and represents pre-month end highs before the Greenback succumbed to the weight or rebalancing sales to hit a 98.645 low on May 1, and the peak so far is 100.200 vs 99.749 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD -</strong> The Franc has been caught in the cross-fire of Buck strength vs Euro weakness, as Usd/Chf hovers near 0.9750 in contrast to Eur/Chf trending back down towards 1.0500, while the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all paring gains vs their US counterpart, with Nzd/Usd retreating from 0.6072 in wake of mixed NZ jobs data overnight, Aud/Usd fading from 0.6451 after similar conflicting retail sales figures for March and Q1 overall, and Usd/Cad losing some crude attraction following a close test of 1.4000 yesterday on the back of a better Canadian trade balance compared to consensus and the US.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK - </strong>In contrast to the broad G10 trend, the Yen is outperforming and edging closer to 106.00, albeit still without the usual level/depth of domestic input given the final day of Golden Week ahead of tomorrow’s return from the extended holiday break. Similarly, the Scandinavian Crowns retain bullish momentum against the backdrop of widespread single currency depreciation that has seen Eur/Jpy trade at 3 year lows well under 115.00, with Eur/Sek testing 10.6200 and Eur/Nok sub-11.0900 at one stage in the run up to tomorrow’s Norges Bank policy meeting.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Usd/Try is extending its apparent unstoppable mission to revisit record highs at 7.2362 vs 7.1680 or so thus far today, even though Turkish banks are still selling the pair and the banking authority has tightened limits on trade with foreign institutions further in an attempt to stop the rally. Perhaps Treasury and Finance Minister Albayrak can turn the tide for the Lira via a conference call to global investors from 13.00GMT, but it’s seemingly a tall order. Elsewhere, the Real could fall prey to bears in the aftermath of Fitch downgrading Brazil’s BB- rating to negative amidst the rising political instability that has already propelled Usd/Brl beyond 5.5700.</p><p>Australian Retail Sales (Mar) M/M 8.5% vs. Exp. 8.2% (Prev. 0.5%).

However, Bobl futures remain below 136.00 and in negative territory alongside Bunds sub-174.00, albeit off lows of 135.78 and 173.89 respectively, while the 10 year UK benchmark has not been able to emulate Tuesday’s performance as 138.00 keeps rebounds from 137.81 in check. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are also under par with the curve a bit steeper pre-ADP and refunding details.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front month futures are back on the rise after some ovrnight consolidation from the prior day’s mammoth gains which saw the contracts settle north of USD 24.50/bbl and USD 30/bbl respectively – aided by the demand side of the equation looking brighter as global economies plan to come back online. Meanwhile, supply side issues appear to be tempering amid the OPEC+ pact, whilst sources also noted that Saudi’s May exports are expected to fall to around 6mln BPD vs. ~9.4mln BPD in April. Over in the US, Texas regulators decided against curtailing the state’s output of over 5mln BPD, albeit this was expected. WTI June resides just under USD 25.50/bbl and towards the middle of its current USD 24-26/bbl intraday band. Brent July meanders south of USD 32/bbl after waning off its USD 32.27/bbl overnight high. Spot gold remains in limbo within a tight USD 7/oz range amid an indecisive risk tone heading into key risk events later this week including the US Labour Market report. Copper meanwhile tracks the gains in US equity futures and sees some support after dipping below but failing to close below its 21 DMA for three consecutive sessions.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks +8.4mln vs. Exp.+7.8mln (Prev. 9.0mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs lowered expected US natgas production forecast levels for Summer 2020, Winter 2020 and Summer 2021, while it maintained the bearish stance on NYMEX gas this summer driven by storage constraints.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>There is a constructive tone to risk this morning, with ES futures flirting with the highs seen on Tuesday. Asian markets had a bias towards higher (ex-Australia), and major European equities are a touch better than neutral. The Treasury curve is moderately bear-steepening ahead of the Treasury’s quarterly refunding announcement. The DXY has crossed 100 to the upside amid further softness in the EUR (German constitutional court decision yesterday, data that highlights the challenges ahead, and downbeat forecasts from the EC all contributing). However, EMFX is softer against the dollar; the PBOC’s yuan fix overnight (after China returned from market holidays) was judged neutral, which supported risk sentiment since there was a concern that the fixing may be aggressively moved to reflect US/China tensions resurfacing – it will be a key point to monitor as tensions heat up ahead of the November elections.</p><p><strong>ABOUT LAST NIGHT: </strong>The slide in equity prices before the close on Tuesday was insightful. The downside came amid cautious remarks by Fed Vice Chair Clarida; but a lot of what Clarida was saying had been said by Fed Chair Powell post-FOMC last week. Markets are fully aware of the economic gloom ahead, and there may have been an element of putting more stock into Clarida’s remarks, since he is regarded as the intellectual driving force on the Fed. Additionally, there could have been technical factors in play; SPX was struggling to vault 2,900, and in thin volume conditions, this may have been all that was needed for the bulls to ditch their efforts. There were also some US/China headlines doing the rounds. But the level at which the rally stalled (just shy of 2,900) was also interesting; back of the envelope valuations suggest 2,890-2,900 is a key region to watch: next year’s forward EPS estimate of USD 170, assume a p/e of 17x = 2,890 – some of these parameters can be adjusted to suit your narrative, however. Accordingly, some think that the playbook through to the election may be horizontal trade, albeit in a large range, given that the Fed/government support has backstopped the downside, while election jitters (US/China tensions ramping up) and more immediately, uncertainty about how recovery/normalisation will play out may put a lid on the upside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE NEXT CATALYST: </strong>There is a feeling on many desks that the current virus news, US/China, and electioneering may be embedded into the price of stocks, leaving markets in search of new catalysts, or significant progress on current themes, to justify multiple expansion/contraction. Citi said the silence is causing unease among its traders who were waiting for the next concrete catalyst to give markets some direction. Nonetheless, Citi says, assets appear to be reading no news as good news, with risk catching a bid this morning. In absence of fresh drivers, Citi said it will continue to mull re-openings.</p><p><strong>SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY: </strong>Naturally, the shape of the recovery will play a key role in how equities fair in the second part of the year. SocGen says markets are undecided on the shape of the recovery (the depth of earnings recession, and risk of a second coronavirus wave are key uncertainties), noting that options are implying a 68% probability that the S&amp;P 500 trades in a range of 2,100-3,500 by the end of the year. There is also uncertainty with regards to testing and developing a vaccine, which SocGen says explains why defensives and bond proxies have performed so well. The bank thinks that this opens the door to opportunities. “The current rally was driven by defensive/tech sectors, mostly through the duration call, unlike the previous recovery episodes in 2003 and 2009. Thus, further upside is possible should the market start to price a V-shaped scenario through a rotation into cyclicals.” In this optimistic scenario, SocGen sees the S&amp;P 500 range at 3,100-3,500 in 2H20, derived from its baseline scenario of peak contagion in 2Q and a gradual, orderly exit from lockdown paving the way for a V-shaped recovery in 2021 – this premise is not universally accepted by market participants, note, and the market is currently trading in line with a U-shaped scenario, the bank concedes.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/733aa1ee-feae-4c44-9253-f05374000540.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>AIRLINES:</strong> US airlines are reportedly burning more than USD 10bln of cash per month, according to a Congressional testimony by Airlines for America (A4a) seen by newswires. The Testimony said that airlines were at risk of bankruptcy if they are forced to refund non-refundable tickets, or those cancelled by passengers. The testimony also claimed that airlines have grounded over 3,000 aircraft, which amounts to nearly 50% of active fleets.</p><p><strong>JOBS DATA COMING UP (0815 ET/1315 BST): </strong>The consensus view expects ADP’s payroll data to show 20.05mln jobs were lost from the US economy in April (range: -25mln to -8.79mln). The data is unlikely to be as market moving as usual prints, given that markets have already discounted a gloomy figure, and the focus has shifted onto how quickly economies can recover and normalise. That said, it will be used to shape expectations of the April jobs report (released Friday). While many are dismissing the upcoming jobs report (hard to trade – if the number was +/- 5mln or even 10mln vs the consensus, would it change the immediate narrative?), there are certain key trends to monitor over the months ahead for a read into how the ‘recovery’ has begun, and how long any ‘normalisation’ is likely to take.

That being said, US equity futures continue their grind higher in EU trade. FTSE 100 (+0.6%) has been leading the gains across the region, potentially aided by a softer Sterling alongside the recovery in the energy markets. The cash index briefly dipped below its 38.2% Fib (move from 6151 to 5702) at 5873 to a low of 5838, before regaining a footing above the level. Sectors also see a mixed performance with no clear standouts or reflection of the current risk sentiment. The energy sector nursed earlier losses but remains a laggard alongside Consumer Discretionary. In terms of the breakdown, Travel &amp; Leisure resides at the bottom but does not see significant underperformance. In terms of individual movers, Dialog Semiconductor (+5.3%), ITV (+4%) and Hannover Re (+4.2%) are among the top post-earning gainers in the Stoxx 600, with the former also aiding the likes of Infineon (+4%) in sympathy. BMW (-3.1%) extends on losses after noting that the highest negative impact is expected in Q2 2020 and PBT is still predicted to be significantly lower. Wirecard (-1.5%) holds onto losses after a 4.4% stakeholder called for a board shakeup.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>EUR/GBP - Having held up relatively well when German factory orders fell around 50% more than forecast, the Euro couldn’t ignore single digit services PMIs in the Eurozone periphery or weaker than expected pan retail sales that accompanied bleak Spring economic projections from the EC. However, Eur/Usd has contained losses below 1.0800 unlike Cable that extended declines from circa 1.2450 through the 50 DMA (1.2411) and 1.2400 on the way to a new low for May around 1.2360. Some suspicions that a significantly worse than anticipated UK construction PMI was pressuring Sterling prior to the official release, while fix-related demand for Eur/Gbp was likely compounded by stops when the cross breached a key technical level in the form of the 200 DMA yet again (0.8722). Next up for the Pound, BoE super Thursday that kicks off at the unusually early time of 7.00BST and comes with the latest MPR and FSR.</p><p>USD - The Dollar is revelling in the plight of others and fragile risk sentiment, with the DXY back on the 100.00 handle ahead of ADP that offers the first monthly US jobs data proxy for Friday’s NFP release, albeit not always a reliable indicator for the BLS headline number. From a technical perspective, 100.209 forms near term resistance for the index and represents pre-month end highs before the Greenback succumbed to the weight or rebalancing sales to hit a 98.645 low on May 1, and the peak so far is 100.200 vs 99.749 at the other extreme.</p><p>CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD - The Franc has been caught in the cross-fire of Buck strength vs Euro weakness, as Usd/Chf hovers near 0.9750 in contrast to Eur/Chf trending back down towards 1.0500, while the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all paring gains vs their US counterpart, with Nzd/Usd retreating from 0.6072 in wake of mixed NZ jobs data overnight, Aud/Usd fading from 0.6451 after similar conflicting retail sales figures for March and Q1 overall, and Usd/Cad losing some crude attraction following a close test of 1.4000 yesterday on the back of a better Canadian trade balance compared to consensus and the US.</p><p>JPY/SEK/NOK - In contrast to the broad G10 trend, the Yen is outperforming and edging closer to 106.00, albeit still without the usual level/depth of domestic input given the final day of Golden Week ahead of tomorrow’s return from the extended holiday break. Similarly, the Scandinavian Crowns retain bullish momentum against the backdrop of widespread single currency depreciation that has seen Eur/Jpy trade at 3 year lows well under 115.00, with Eur/Sek testing 10.6200 and Eur/Nok sub-11.0900 at one stage in the run up to tomorrow’s Norges Bank policy meeting.</p><p>EM - Usd/Try is extending its apparent unstoppable mission to revisit record highs at 7.2362 vs 7.1680 or so thus far today, even though Turkish banks are still selling the pair and the banking authority has tightened limits on trade with foreign institutions further in an attempt to stop the rally. Perhaps Treasury and Finance Minister Albayrak can turn the tide for the Lira via a conference call to global investors from 13.00GMT, but it’s seemingly a tall order.

Meanwhile, supply side issues appear to be tempering amid the OPEC+ pact, whilst sources also noted that Saudi’s May exports are expected to fall to around 6mln BPD vs. ~9.4mln BPD in April. Over in the US, Texas regulators decided against curtailing the state’s output of over 5mln BPD, albeit this was expected. WTI June resides just under USD 25.50/bbl and towards the middle of its current USD 24-26/bbl intraday band. <strong>Brent</strong> July meanders south of USD 32/bbl after waning off its USD 32.27/bbl overnight high. <strong>Spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains in limbo within a tight USD 7/oz range amid an indecisive risk tone heading into key risk events later this week including the US Labour Market report. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile tracks the gains in US equity futures and sees some support after dipping below but failing to close below its 21 DMA for three consecutive sessions.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Having held up relatively well when German factory orders fell around 50% more than forecast, the Euro couldn’t ignore single digit services PMIs in the Eurozone periphery or weaker than expected pan retail sales that accompanied bleak Spring economic projections from the EC. However, Eur/Usd has contained losses below 1.0800 unlike Cable that extended declines from circa 1.2450 through the 50 DMA (1.2411) and 1.2400 on the way to a new low for May around 1.2360. Some suspicions that a significantly worse than anticipated UK construction PMI was pressuring Sterling prior to the official release, while fix-related demand for Eur/Gbp was likely compounded by stops when the cross breached a key technical level in the form of the 200 DMA yet again (0.8722). Next up for the Pound, BoE super Thursday that kicks off at the unusually early time of 7.00BST and comes with the latest MPR and FSR.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar is revelling in the plight of others and fragile risk sentiment, with the <strong>DXY </strong>back on the 100.00 handle ahead of ADP that offers the first monthly US jobs data proxy for Friday’s NFP release, albeit not always a reliable indicator for the BLS headline number. From a technical perspective, 100.209 forms near term resistance for the index and represents pre-month end highs before the Greenback succumbed to the weight or rebalancing sales to hit a 98.645 low on May 1, and the peak so far is 100.200 vs 99.749 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Franc has been caught in the cross-fire of Buck strength vs Euro weakness, as Usd/Chf hovers near 0.9750 in contrast to Eur/Chf trending back down towards 1.0500, while the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all paring gains vs their US counterpart, with Nzd/Usd retreating from 0.6072 in wake of mixed NZ jobs data overnight, Aud/Usd fading from 0.6451 after similar conflicting retail sales figures for March and Q1 overall, and Usd/Cad losing some crude attraction following a close test of 1.4000 yesterday on the back of a better Canadian trade balance compared to consensus and the US.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>In contrast to the broad G10 trend, the Yen is outperforming and edging closer to 106.00, albeit still without the usual level/depth of domestic input given the final day of Golden Week ahead of tomorrow’s return from the extended holiday break. Similarly, the Scandinavian Crowns retain bullish momentum against the backdrop of widespread single currency depreciation that has seen Eur/Jpy trade at 3 year lows well under 115.00, with Eur/Sek testing 10.6200 and Eur/Nok sub-11.0900 at one stage in the run up to tomorrow’s Norges Bank policy meeting.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Try is extending its apparent unstoppable mission to revisit record highs at 7.2362 vs 7.1680 or so thus far today, even though Turkish banks are still selling the pair and the banking authority has tightened limits on trade with foreign institutions further in an attempt to stop the rally. Perhaps Treasury and Finance Minister Albayrak can turn the tide for the Lira via a conference call to global investors from 13.00GMT, but it’s seemingly a tall order. Elsewhere, the Real could fall prey to bears in the aftermath of Fitch downgrading Brazil’s BB- rating to negative amidst the rising political instability that has already propelled Usd/Brl beyond 5.5700.</p>",

On Monday, the Treasury announced plans to borrow USD 3trln in Q2 2020, as the administration steps up virus relief spending.</p><p><strong>BILLS: </strong>Analysts think much of this new issuance will come via bills. Analysts at Wrightson said “regardless of how aggressively the Treasury boosts its coupon offerings, the vast majority of the Treasury’s Q2 borrowing needs will have to be met in the bill sector.” Wrightson looks for an increase of USD 2.7trln in bill supply (from USD 2.3trln in Q1), to roughly USD 5trln at the end of the quarter.</p><p><strong>US TREASURY EXPECTED TO OFFER USD 91BLN OF TREASURY SECURITIES (PREV. 84BLN) (Per Refinitiv)</strong></p><ul><li>3-year size seen at USD 42bln (prev. USD 38bln)</li><li>10-year size seen at USD 29bln (prev. USD 27bln)</li><li>30-year size seen at USD 21bln (prev. USD 19bln)</li></ul><p><strong>2-YEAR, 5-YEAR, 7-YEAR NOTE SIZES: </strong>2-year , 5-year, and 7-year note sizes may be boosted by USD 2bln apiece, TD Securities thinks, taking it to USD 42bln, USD 43bln and 35bln respectively.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>20-YEAR BOND: </strong>The Treasury has previously announced that it intends to issue a 20-year bond in H1 2020. The median expectation is that it will be sized at USD 15bln, with re-openings at USD 12bln, though some see risks of USD 18bln size and USD 15bln re-openings.</p><p><strong>SOFR-LINKED ISSUANCE: </strong>The Treasury has also floating the idea of a 1-year SOFR-linked FRN, and in February said it was seeking more information about a potential issue in H1 2020. \"So far the feedback from money funds has been very favorable,\" TD Securities says, \"We expect Treasury to launch a request for information soon, which can allow them to announce new 1y SOFR FRNs in August or November.\" TD explains that this would help to fund the Treasury and help standardised SOFR FRN market conventions. \"This will also reiterate that the Libor transition is still on track,\" given the end-2021 deadline for Libor.</p><p><strong>OTHER ISSUES: </strong>With the floodgates of issuance set to be opened, some desks have advised keeping an eye out for chatter about a 4-year or a 6-year note issue. TD Securities says “Given our view that the 2-5y sector will see significant demand due to flight to quality flows and significant Fed purchases (approximately 25% of Fed QE is currently conducted in the sector), we expect Treasury to discuss bringing a 4-year maturity to market.”</p>",

Moreover, the core Eurozone bond seemed oblivious to a wobble in the Dax future soon after the 6.00GMT release and has drifted down further from overnight Eurex highs to 174.00 vs Tuesday’s 174.41 close. In contrast, Italian BTPs are paring some of yesterday’s heavy losses amidst more reports that fresh fiscal stimulus will be signed off soon rather than a somewhat bland and standard riposte from the ECB to Germany’s Constitutional Court ruling against QE proportionality in the form of underlining its inflation mandate and intent to ensure policy transmission across all sectors of the economy and areas of the bloc. Ahead, services PMIs, retail sales and EC forecasts before the first monthly NFP proxy via ADP, with a couple of ECB speakers also slated.</p>",

(+0.1%)</strong> were varied with the ongoing easing of lockdown restrictions in Hong Kong helping the local bourse weather the 42% slump in retail sales, while mainland China was subdued on reopen from the 5-day closure as it took its first opportunity to react to the increased tensions with US after President Trump’s recent tariff threat and finger-pointing at China for the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, <strong>India’s NIFTY (+1.0%)</strong> was indecisive and swung between gains and losses with early momentarily wiped out amid a slump in energy names after the government hiked duties on petrol and diesel prices before the index rallied again, while Japan remained closed but is due to return from Golden Week tomorrow.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was subdued and took out stops at last week’s lows to briefly trade at its weakest since mid-March amid the cautious tone and continued absence of Japanese participants, while antipodeans were rangebound with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidating at the 0.6400 handle after mixed Retail Sales data and with only mild gains in <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> after better than expected jobs data was partially offset by softer wage growth.</p><p>Australian Retail Sales (Mar) M/M 8.5% vs. Exp. 8.2% (Prev. 0.5%).

In addition, gains were seen following the latest private inventory report which despite posting a larger than expected build in headline crude inventories, also showed a surprise draw in gasoline stockpiles. Nonetheless, prices have since retreated off their highs amid the indecisive risk tone but found a base around the USD 24/bbl.

The 10-year yield rose to as high as 67bps overnight, with pressure remaining on the TPLEX in the European session amid the weakness seen in EGBs after the German court ruling. However, as Europeans departed yields gradually pared some of their rise, with the 10-year finding its floor around the 65bps area (BMO’s analysts have identified the 0.60-0.65% yield zone as the key range within the broader 0.54-0.78% range). Further retracement was unlikely given the continued ramp-up of corporate issuance post-earnings (May is traditionally the busiest month of the year for IG offerings), as well as the Treasury’s refunding announcement (due Wednesday) after it noted it would be raising a record USD 3trln on Monday. Meanwhile, a strong SPX rally also muted the appetite for haven debt. By settlement major curve spreads were slightly steeper, with 2s unchanged at 0.19%, 5s +1bps at 0.37%, 10s +2bps at 0.66%, and 30s +3bps at 1.33%.

Furthermore, he suggested it may be the case that more policy support is needed from the Fed as well as some fiscal policy and that they can expand the lending programmes as needed. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> noted that interest rates will remain low likely for years not months and believes the market expects this, while he added that unemployment can come down substantially by the end of the year if the stimulus programmes work as planned.

ASX 200 (-0.5%) retreated below the 5400 level with the declines led by weakness across the large banking names, although losses in the index were cushioned by strength in gold miners as the precious metals held above the USD 1700/oz level and with tech names galvanized by outperformance of the sector stateside. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were varied with the ongoing easing of lockdown restrictions in Hong Kong helping the local bourse weather the 42% slump in retail sales, while mainland China was subdued on reopen from the 5-day closure as it took its first opportunity to react to the increased tensions with US after President Trump’s recent tariff threat and finger-pointing at China for the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, India’s NIFTY (+1.0%) was indecisive and swung between gains and losses with early momentarily wiped out amid a slump in energy names after the government hiked duties on petrol and diesel prices before the index rallied again, while Japan remained closed but is due to return from Golden Week tomorrow.</p>",

However, the court ruled there was a failure to ensure the actions were proportionate and gave the ECB 3 months to satisfy the principle of proportionality or the Bundesbank will no longer be able to participate in this, while GBP/USD is also lacklustre with price action contained below 1.2450 after the UK death toll from the coronavirus recently surpassed Italy to become the highest in Europe. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is subdued and took out stops from last week’s lows to trade at its weakest since mid-March amid the cautious tone and continued absence of Japanese participants, while antipodeans are rangebound with AUD/USD consolidating at the 0.6400 handle after mixed Retail Sales data and with only mild gains in NZD/USD after better than expected jobs data was partially offset by softer wage growth.</p>",
