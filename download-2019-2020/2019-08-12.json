Equities moved in inverse to Treasuries, where yields continued to fall, further fuelling the move lower in risk assets amid the 2s10 reaching its narrowest since 2010.

The upward momentum in Treasuries and EGBs, specifically in the belly- to front-end, was spurred by the further weakening of the Chinese yuan in the earlier European session, and then was extended through till settlement as fears grew of further escalation in Hong Kong as Chinese military forces close in on the nation. By settlement the curve had considerably bull flattened, with the 10-year yield down by 9bps, and the 2-year yield down by about 4bps; the entire curve had flattened by 6bps whilst newswires highlighted that the 2s10s was at its narrowest since 2010.

Equities moved in inverse to Treasuries, where yields continued to fall, further fuelling the move lower in risk assets amid the 2s10 reaching its narrowest since 2010. As one would expect in a hampered risk environment, gold outperformed on the day, sitting comfortably above the 1500 level.

There were reports of armed police building up in Shenzen, a city which borders Hong Kong, which China Global Times Editor, Hu Xijin, believes it is a clear warning to rioters in Hong Kong and that the possibility of Beijing intervening in Hong Kong is rising. Commentators are now questioning how far the US could intervene in the Hong Kong situation; CNBC, citing a Senior Administration Official said the administration is monitoring developments, but “as the President said”, it is a matter between Hong Kong and China – a line likely to appease Chinese officials, who have asked international players to stay out of its domestic matters. However, not all are looking for a passive approach; GOP Senator Rick Scott suggested that the US should remove Hong Kong’s special status that allows it to avoid tariffs, if the PLA were to intervene in Hong Kong, arguing that any violate approach to quelling uprising should change the way the US views Hong Kong – such an approach would likely exacerbate the tense relations between the US and China.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Italian lawmakers are to meet on Tuesday to decide when to debate the League’s no confidence motion in government, after initial reports expecting the date to be announced today. Both the members of the coalition – League and 5SM – are both on record calling for fresh elections. But the real question, Goldman Sachs says, is that in the scenario of the government losing the confidence of Parliament, will President Mattarella opt for a caretaker government (to vote through the 2020 Budget in Q4), or whether Italians will go to the polls in October or November (which would leave the current government in power to manage affairs until the election). Mattarella has previously spoken about the importance of pushing through the Budget, and as such, Goldman believes risks are tilted in this direction. \"In our view, it is likely that the President of the Republic would press political parties to support a caretaker government that would pass the 2020 budget law before general elections take place to limit the risk of a negative market outturn,\" Goldman says, \"however, it is not clear at this stage whether there will be a majority in Parliament to support a caretaker/institutional government.\" Goldman says that a caretaker government would be near-term bullish news for financial markets, while a general election in Q4, given Lega's strength in recent opinion polls, would be near-term bearish, as investors would be likely to price-in a higher risk of a further weakening of the public finance outlook, of rating agency downgrades and of a more confrontational dialogue with European partners regarding both fiscal rules and immigration.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>The Fed is considering a new tool, a counter-cyclical capital buffer, however it is not clear when such a decision would be made, the WSJ reported. Previously the Fed announced it was considering a new repo rate facility, although details of if and when it would be implemented have been scant.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Reports in the Sunday newspapers suggested UK PM Johnson has accepted an offer from Irish PM Varadkar to meet in early September; the meeting will allow the two sides to gain a better understanding of their respective positions on Brexit and the Irish backstop. However, a UK spokesman rejected this saying no meeting has been scheduled. Ireland reiterated its position that the backstop was not open for negotiations. Hopes are low, especially given that the Johnson administration has already stated that the Backstop needs to go, while a solution to replace it remains elusive. Meanwhile, The Times, citing a leaked paper, showed that MPs are drawing up plans to force PM Johnson to request a Brexit extension; under the proposals set out in the document, 1) MPs plan to block any attempt by the PM to call an election before Brexit day unless the PM agrees to a Brexit extension for the poll to the place, and 2) use a vote of confidence in the runup to October 31st to take control of the parliamentary timetable and change the law to force the PM to request for an Article 50 extension. Elsewhere, ITV’s Brand stated it seems like September 9th could be the crunch date for preventing a no deal Brexit, he notes the government has to report on the issue of Northern Ireland on September 4th, with a debate on power sharing with Northern Ireland within 5 days. This would provide the 'remain rebel alliance' with an opportunity to try and use amendments to prevent a No Deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 22 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-12.</strong> The T-plex continued its march higher to start the week, with ongoing Hong Kong tensions being the latest catalysts for bulls. The upward momentum in Treasuries and EGBs, specifically in the belly- to front-end, was spurred by the further weakening of the Chinese yuan in the earlier European session, and then was extended through till settlement as fears grew of further escalation in Hong Kong as Chinese military forces close in on the nation. By settlement the curve had considerably bull flattened, with the 10-year yield down by 9bps, and the 2-year yield down by about 4bps; the entire curve had flattened by 6bps whilst newswires highlighted that the 2s10s was at its narrowest since 2010.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.43 HIGHER AT USD 54.93/BBL; BRENT (V9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.04 HIGHER AT USD 58.57. </strong>Oil traded choppy on Monday, but ultimately closed mildly firmer after bouncing from lows and retreating off earlier peaks amidst a dampening of wider risk appetite. Several factors have been playing into the downside seen, including further weakening of the Chinese yuan, rising tensions in Hong Kong as protests intensify, and overhanging doubts of a near-term China-US trade truce. Elsewhere, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister expressed commitment to the OPEC+ production agreements, but otherwise supply-related news flow has been light to start the week. Latest US energy inventory expectations see crude stocks -2.8mln bbls, Gasoline -0.8mln bbls, and distillates +0.9mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS:</strong> <strong>S&amp;P 500 -1.2% AT 2883, NASDAQ-100 -1.1% AT 7562, DOW JONES -1.5% AT 25896. S&amp;P 500 Sectors: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -1.4%, Consumer Staples -0.7%, Energy -1.4%, Financials -1.9%, Health Care -1.1%, Industrials -1.4%, Information Technology -1.3%, Materials -1.6%, Telecommunication Services -1%, Utilities -0.3%</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) were lower after further merger details emerged where there were suggestions that the deal is imminent and could be announced as soon as this week, after both boards met this past weekend to work out a few remaining decisions regarding board structure (CBS are slated to get 13 seats to Viacom’s 4), leadership, deal terms and naming.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Sysco (SYY) was higher after EPS beat expectations, however its revenues fell slightly short.&nbsp; Amgen (AMGN) was higher as a US judge denied Novartis (NOVN SW) a patent to AMGN’s arthritis drug, Enbrel. Agricultural names were pressured (MOS, DE, NTR) following WASDE data where corn end stocks came in higher than expectations. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) &amp; MGM Resorts (MGM) were lower as flights at Hong Kong airport have been cancelled, providing implications to Macau. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) was lowest out of the gaming names as it looks to fight off its last lawsuit from Macau, which was initially filed in 2012, where Asian American Entertainment Corp is now asking for USD 11.94bln for compensation in regard to an alleged breach of contract.</p><p><strong>* BROKER MOVES: </strong>Roku (ROKU) was higher after a positive mention at Needham, who said it is a better bet than Netflix (NFLX). DXC Tech (DXC) was lower after a price cut at Citi to USD 60 from USD 77. Carrizo Oil and Gas (CRZO) was lower after a downgrade at Keybanc.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The FX sphere has been dominated by risk off trade, though explanations are varied for the price action. The week started off with tensions in HK and analysts noting Italian political woes, lending a bid into <strong>havens </strong>like JPY (USDJPY fell to a whisker of 105) and CHF, while XAU remained above the USD 1,500 mark. The offshore yuan is flattish, despite the PBOC fixing the yuan weaker (but not as weak as the consensus view was expecting) - the Chinese offshore currency did strengthen on news which suggested that protestors had cleared away from the airport area of HK, which helped risk sentiment in the pre-market. <strong>DXY</strong> is negative, but the dollar is mixed, in general. The <strong>EMFX </strong>bloc - particularly LatAm FX - has been impacted by the primaries in Argentina over the weekend, which has hit the ARS primarily, but also the BRL and MXN to some extent. The <strong>Antipodes</strong> are trading soft, in line with risk sentiment.<strong> CAD</strong> has been lingering around 1.3250, likely magnetic with chunky expiries at today's NY cut. <strong>GBP</strong> trades slightly firmer, with a plot by MPs to force a Brexit extension capturing the narrative, while there are also mixed reports that PM Johnson will meet his Irish counterpart in September for talks.</p><p><strong>* ARS: </strong>The Argentine Peso has been obliterated after the weekend's election Primary results, where the main opposition candidate won a convincing victory, which analysts said raises risks of a negative feedback loop, where a weaker currency spikes inflation, and presents more political pressure for the incumbent government. The primaries showed Albert Fernandex extending his lead vs the market-friendly President Mauricio Macro by around 15ppts - analysts were expecting between 4-7%. The results, Goldman Sachs said, has made a tail risk – the possibility that the more market-friendly presidential candidate would not survive the first round of Argentina’s presidential election – a significantly more-likely possibility. \"Over the next few hours and days, the exact path of Argentina’s assets is uncertain: for example, the volatility of the currency in the next several days will depend upon how much the BCRA, given limited ammunition, will try to counter market pressures during the very early stages of an election campaign,\" Goldman says, \"moreover, given the size of Sunday’s margin of victory, there is scope for an overshoot if the market’s reaction is very large.\" GS reiterates the message of remaining cautious on the ARS, and Argentine assets.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>While many FX wraps are suggesting that political developments in Italy are keeping the EUR defensive, the single currency continues to consolidate around the 1.12 mark, an area it has become quite familiar with in recent trade. With that said, the single currency is off lows near 1.1150. The Bund/BTP spread is being monitored, once again exerting its influence on the single currency, and after the spread widened by a chunky amount at the end of last week, some are now talking about a mean-reversion towards a 300bps gap. Taking a more medium-term view, the prospect of Italian elections in October/November overlaps with the Brexit timetable, where the UK is scheduled to depart on 31st October, potentially leaving Q4, likely leaving risks for EUR elevated into year-end (from this view, anyway).</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In contrast to mixed and divergent developments in major currencies, aversion remains rife across the region and nowhere more apparent than in Argentina where the Peso has been decimated in wake of primary election results showing a hefty loss for incumbent President Macri. Usd/Ars catapulted to around 65.0000 at one stage, with the likes of Usd/Brl and Usd/Mxn up over 4.0100 and 19.7700 in contagion. However, Usd/Cnh pared back from 7.1100+ peaks after another incremental rise in the official Usd/Cny fix following more unrest in Hong Kong that closed the airport and grounded flights, as later reports suggested that the authorities are working towards a resumption of services on Tuesday. This helped other pairs recoup some losses, but sentiment remains fragile amidst ongoing strains between the US and China on trade and separate geopolitical issues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>Sterling has emerged as the G10 outperformer, with Cable reclaiming 1.2100+ status at best and Eur/Gbp touching 0.9250 on a combination of short covering and weakness in the Dollar and Euro independently. However, the Yen lost safe-haven premium as the overall mood improved somewhat, with Usd/Jpy also meeting firm support/bids ahead of 105.00 where 1.6 bn option expiries ran off and helped to prevent a breach to test the early January flash crash base (104.87).</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Also firmer against the Greenback, but only after recovering from early EU session lows circa 0.9750 and 1.1162 for the Franc and Euro respectively. Usd/Chf pulled back as the <strong>DXY</strong> retreated from 97.744 highs to 97.345, while Eur/Usd bounced just ahead of the 10 DMA (1.1161) and revisited Fib resistance (1.1220) that has been respected on several occasions of late awaiting the conclusion of a coalition confidence meeting in Rome.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All on the back foot, with the Aussie probing key levels vs its US and NZ counterpart at 0.6750 and 1.0450 respectively, but not breaching either convincingly ahead of a scheduled speech by RBA Deputy Governor Kent tonight and potentially pivotal jobs data for next month’s policy meeting. Nevertheless, the Kiwi has also firmed up within a 0.6440-75 range and a particularly bearish NZ Treasury report flagging a -0.35% OCR rate in the case of a crisis, while the Loonie is meandering between 1.3200-50 amidst fluctuating crude prices and the overall risk tone. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns have been subject to swings in the general market mood, and the Nok to oil, as Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek trade mainly near the upper ends of 10.0180-9.9330 and 10.7445-6845 boundaries.</p>",

Several factors were being attributed to the sell off, including further weakening of the Chinese yuan, rising tensions in Hong Kong as protests intensify, and overhanging doubts of a near-term China-US trade truce. Elsewhere, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister expressed commitment to the OPEC+ production agreements, but otherwise supply-related news flow has been light to start the week.</li><li>RBC’s analysts on the crude outlook note, “The marginal barrel is having difficulty finding buyers and physical weakness is eroding US export economics,” saying there is limited scope for short covering rallies based on positioning, where short interest in the crude benchmarks remains low despite the recent price declines, which it believes have been a function of a physical demand drought in addition to speculators unwinding long positions. On the prospect of China adding US crude to its tariff lists, the bank says this would serve as more of a symbolic action given China’s existing preference to other grades of crude, rather than WTI, especially now that the yuan has been weakening, and WTI has been relatively less cheap in comparison to other crude grades, as of late. RBC also sees a likely slowdown in oil demand for the remainder of the year (as have many other analysts), particularly due to the “war chest” of crude stockpiles China has accumulated.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Italian lawmakers today will set the date which the Italian Conte-led government (of Lega Nord and 5SM) will face a confidence motion, at<strong> 1500 BST/1600 CET. </strong>The real question, Goldman Sachs says, is that in the scenario of the government losing the confidence of Parliament, will President Mattarella opt for a caretaker government (to vote through the 2020 Budget in Q4), or whether Italians will go to the polls in October or November (which would leave the current government in power to manage affairs until the election). Mattarella has previously spoken about the importance of pushing through the Budget, and as such, Goldman believes risks are tilted in this direction. \"In our view, it is likely that the President of the Republic would press political parties to support a caretaker government that would pass the 2020 budget law before general elections take place to limit the risk of a negative market out turn,\" Goldman says, \"however, it is not clear at this stage whether there will be a majority in Parliament to support a caretaker/institutional government.\" Goldman says that a caretaker government would be near-term bullish news for financial markets, while a general election in Q4 (given Lega's strength in recent opinion polls) would be near-term bearish, as investors would be likely to price-in a higher risk of a further weakening of the public finance outlook, of rating agency downgrades and of a more confrontational dialogue with European partners regarding both fiscal rules and immigration. The 10yr IT/GE spread has narrowed slightly intraday to 235bps at time of writing, albeit largely due to Fitch maintaining Italy’s rating and outlook, although analysts at SocGen are sceptical and note that if new elections become a formality, then markets may see a politically driven mean reversion to 300bps.&nbsp;</p>",

(La Stampa)</p><p>Fitch affirmed Italy at 'BBB'; Outlook Negative and raised Russia to 'BBB'; Outlook Stable. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>European equities have given up the gain seen at the open and now trade mixed [Eurostoxx 50 +0.1% vs. +0.9% at the open], which follows a cautious handover from the Asia-Pac session whilst Japanese markets were closed on holiday.&nbsp; The bout of risk-aversion coincided with reports of escalating violence in Hong Kong, with its airport cancelling all flights as protestors stage a sit-in, whilst separate reports noted that People's Armed Police are reportedly gathering and heading towards Shenzhen (a city bordering Hong Kong) in advance of apparent large scale exercises. Back to Europe, bourses are mixed with some mild underperformance in the FTSE 100 as a firmer Sterling weighs on exporters. Sectors are mixed with no clear outperformer/laggard. In terms of individual movers: Osram Licht (+9.9%) shares spiked to the top of the pan-European index after AMS (-9.5%) offered EUR 4.1bln to acquire the Co. The bid is 10% higher than that of the Bain &amp; Carlyle consortium; Osram have said they will review the offer. On the flip side, Anglo American (-1.4%) and ThyssenKrupp (-2.8%) rest near the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid the respective declines in copper and iron ore prices. Finally, luxury good makers also bear the brunt of the US/China trade spat, LVMH (-2.6%), Kering (-1.4%); with the Global Times editor noting, over the weekend, that as long as the US forces a deal on China with maximum pressure, then “there will never be a deal”.</p><p>Facebook (FB) - The EU are nearing a decision regarding Facebook privacy cases, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission reportedly has the power to levy billions of euros in fines. (WSJ)</p><p>FX</p><p>EUR - Not the worst G10 performer, but one of the major movers amidst all round selling that appeared to start vs Sterling as Eur/Gbp recoiled from circa 0.9325 towards 0.9250. A corporate order has been touted, but Eur/Jpy also crossed 118.00 and seemed to trip stops and technical levels on its way down to almost 117.50. Meanwhile, the single currency succumbed to accelerated declines through 1.1200 vs the Dollar and alongside ongoing Italian political jitters chart points may also have exacerbated the fall as the 21 DMA at 1.1176 gave way and the headline pair has struggled to sustain rebounds beyond Fib resistance at 1.1220 in recent sessions. However, the 10 DMA at 1.1161 is holding in for now at least.</p><p>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK - A broad deterioration or erosion of risk sentiment against the backdrop of heightened unrest in Hong Kong and the ongoing Yuan depreciation (Usd/Cnh now probing 7.1100) has hit the Aussie and Kiwi especially hard, with Aud/Usd down to around 0.6750 and Nzd/Usd under 0.6450. Note also, dovish Central Bank vibes continue to undermine the Antipodean currencies with research from the NZ Treasury overnight raising eyebrows given -0.35% tagged for the OCR in a crisis situation. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns are not deriving any indirect support from the aforementioned Euro weakness or relatively hawkish monetary policy stances ahead of Thursday’s Norges Bank meeting, as Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek rebound to just over 9.9900 and 10.7300 respectively, with the former also propelled by another downturn in oil prices.</p><p>JPY/GBP - The Yen is strong across the board and back in demand as a safe-haven, with Usd/Jpy down to 105.15 and eyeing 105.00 ahead of flash crash lows beneath the big figure, but perhaps wary of decent option expiry interest at the round number (1.6 bn) that could provide support. Meanwhile, the Pound is also bid on the cross flow noted above, and with Cable holding firm between 1.2015-75 parameters after reports that a group of UK MPs are trying to ensure another Brextension rather than risk PM Johnson leading the country out of the EU on October 31 with no deal.</p><p>EM - Widespread losses vs a mostly buoyant Buck as the DXY continues to pivot 97.500, but some protection for the Rouble from risk aversion and soft Brent via Fitch upgrading Russia to BBB last Friday. However, Usd/Rub is still firmer within a 65.2535-5700 range.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bunds extended gains to 30 ticks at best, but pulled up ahead of 177.55 interim resistance and some distance from last week’s 177.74 contract peak again. However, safe-haven debt has benefited from a general deterioration in risk appetite, with even Gilts recovering and posting a marginal new Liffe high at 134.40 (+12 ticks vs -19 ticks at one stage) and US Treasuries nudging fresh overnight session pinnacles amidst more pronounced curve flattening on little sign of any improvement in global trade or geopolitical tensions. Conversely, Italian BTPs seem to have topped out at 138.00 as the clock ticks down to a meeting in Rome between coalition partners and the President to set the date for a confidence vote that is likely to trigger new elections.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>WTI and Brent futures have succumbed to the firmer Dollar and the risk averse tone around the market thus far. The former breached 54/bbl to the downside whilst the latter hovers around the 58/bbl handle. Newsflow has been relatively light for the complex, although the Kuwaiti oil minister stated that the country is committed to fully implement OPEC’s output pacts and noted that fears concerning a global slowdown are “exaggerated”. Analysts at ING see stronger non-OPEC supply growth in 2020 which will subsequently lead to OEPC taking further action or face the risk of further declines in prices. Elsewhere, Gold prices are choppy and ultimately unchanged on the day as the yellow metal balances a cautious risk tone against a firmer Buck. Spot Gold now hovers around the 1500/oz level (having hit a current intraday low of 1487.50/oz).&nbsp; Meanwhile, copper prices fell back below the 2.60/lb level as a firmer Greenback and fragile risk tone weighed on the red metal. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures fell to a two-month low, notching its 8th straight session of losses amid the ongoing supply worries and a bleak demand outlook as China’s top steel-producing province looks to tighten emission requirements.</p><p>Kuwait is committed to fully implement OPEC's output reduction agreement, according to the Kuwaiti Oil Minister, adds that global oil demand is currently acceptable, expects excess in oil inventories to fall gradually and sees a pick-up in demand in H2.

This follows an indecisive tone across Asia-Pacific markets where holidays kept turnover light and sentiment remained fragile due to the ongoing US-China trade stand-off. However, Italian bonds have resumed on a firmer footing amidst some relief that Fitch retained its BBB rating, albeit with the outlook still negative and a vote of no confidence in the coalition Government looming. The benchmark bond is just off a 137.91 peak vs 137.36 at the low and its 137.04 previous settlement ahead of a meeting in Rome between the party leaders and President Mattarella scheduled around 3 pm UK time.</p>",

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> was flat at the 97.50 level with price action contained within the tight range seen for most of last week, despite renewed jawboning by President Trump in which he wants the Fed to lower rates by 1 percentage point and reiterated that a strong USD is hurting manufacturers. The lacklustre trade in the greenback marginally benefitted its major counterparts with <strong>EUR/USD</strong> above 1.1200 although upside was restricted amid the breakdown in Italy’s ruling coalition and with a potential no-confidence vote looming, while <strong>GBP/USD</strong> also received some mild reprieve from the recent losses triggered by weak GDP numbers which showed the first quarterly contraction since 2012. Furthermore, the latest reports stated MPs are drawing up plans to force PM Johnson to request a Brexit extension, and opposition Labour MPs have been told to cancel travel plans for next month as party leader Corbyn prepares to table a no-confidence motion. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses revisited Friday’s lows amid a lack of participants in Japan, while antipodeans were initially weighed by the declines in iron ore prices, early cautiousness and after a New Zealand Treasury paper suggested the OCR could decline to -0.35% in a crisis, although the pairs gradually recovered as risk sentiment began to improve and CNH strengthened after a firmer than expected PBoC fix.</p><p>New Zealand Treasury paper stated RBNZ could reduce OCR to -0.35% (currently 1.0%) in a crisis and sees asset purchases as a less appealing tool, while there were also comments from New Zealand PM Ardern that the domestic economy is in good shape and that the government is constantly looking at whatever stimulus it can do. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities mostly traded sideways in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures plateaued above the USD 54.00/bbl level after the technical-driven gains on Friday and reports that China chartered its first US crude cargo since the most recent tariff threat from US President Trump. Nonetheless, price action in the complex was muted overnight amid the cautious tone in the region and with mass closures in Asia and Middle East for public holidays. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were also lacklustre amid similar humdrum trade in the greenback with the pressure metal meandering around the USD 1500/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> reflected the cautious gains in stocks with prices restricted amid weakness in Chinese commodity prices in which <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> prices slipped a further 4% in early trade.</p><p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (9/Aug): Oil rigs -6 at 764, gas rigs -2 at 169, total rigs -8 at 934.

However, in later trade, yields moved higher, leaving the curve slightly steeper, with major curve spreads modestly wider to the tune of 1-2bps at settlement; the afternoon bounce was due to the White House ‘clarifying’ comments President Trump made on Huawei. On the week, the curve has bull flattened (on the week: 2s -9bps, 5s -11bps, 10s -12bps, and 30s -14bps). US T-note futures settled 7+ ticks lower at 129-22.</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) was lower with the index weighed by weakness in commodity names including profit taking in gold miners and as iron ore prices resumed an aggressive pullback from last month’s record levels, although the losses in the index were stemmed due to resilience in the top weighted financials and as JB Hi-Fi led the outperformance in the Consumer Discretionary sector post-earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) kept afloat and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) was underpinned after the PBoC set a firmer than expected reference rate and injected liquidity through reverse repos for the 1st time in 2 weeks. In addition, strength was seen in brokerages after China instructed a revision to margin financing and margin trading regulations, although trade concerns lingered following President Trump’s recent suggestion that talks with China may be cancelled. As a reminder, Japan, Singapore and India were among the numerous holiday closures across the region and Middle East.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week with a somewhat cautious tone amid several market closures and after last Friday’s losses on Wall St. due to ongoing trade uncertainty. ASX 200 (Unch.) opened lower with the index weighed by weakness in commodity names including profit taking in gold miners and as iron ore prices resumed an aggressive pullback from last month’s record levels, although the losses in the index were later retraced due to strength in top weighted financials and with JB Hi-Fi leading the outperformance in the Consumer Discretionary sector post-earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are positive after the PBoC set a firmer than expected reference rate and injected liquidity through reverse repos for the 1st time in 2 weeks, but with gains capped as trade concerns lingered after President Trump recently suggested that talks with China may be cancelled. As a reminder, Japan, Singapore and India are among the numerous holiday closures across the region and Middle East.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat near the 97.50 level with price action contained within the tight range seen for most of last week, despite renewed jawboning by President Trump in which he wants the Fed to lower rates by 1 percentage point and reiterated that a strong USD is hurting manufacturers. The lacklustre trade in the greenback marginally benefits its major counterparts with EUR/USD above 1.1200 but with upside restricted amid the breakdown in Italy’s ruling coalition and with a potential no-confidence vote later today. GBP/USD also gets some mild reprieve from the recent losses triggered by weak GDP numbers which showed the first quarterly contraction since 2012. Furthermore, the latest reports stated MPs are drawing up plans to force PM Johnson to request a Brexit extension, while opposition Labour MPs have been told to cancel travel plans for next month as party leader Corbyn prepares to table a no-confidence motion. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses revisited Friday’s lows amid a lack of participants in Japan, while antipodeans were initially weighed by the declines in iron ore prices, early cautiousness and after a New Zealand Treasury paper suggested the OCR could decline to -0.35% in a crisis, although the pairs gradually recovered as risk sentiment began to improve and CNH strengthened after a firmer than expected PBoC fix.</p>",
