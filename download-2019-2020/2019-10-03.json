After the release of a grim ISM, which showed weakening momentum in the US was no longer confined to the manufacturing sectors, the immediate reaction was risk-off, with equities falling, fixed income rising, while the dollar saw downside and gold rallied. However, after traders chewed the fat, equities pared losses (bonds remained elevated the dollar stayed near lows), signalling that the mood may have now shifted back to ‘bad news is good news’, as any weakness in the US economy will be met with a supportive FOMC (that is the theory, at least). Attention, therefore, moves towards tomorrow’s key jobs report, as well as an address from Fed Chair Powell (who will also speak a couple of times next week). After market, there will be attention on remarks from the Fed’s Clarida.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING: </strong>The headline fell by more than analysts had expected (a three-year low at 52.6, versus the consensus 55.0, from a prior 56.4). The details under the bonnet were not particularly encouraging (new orders dropped to 53.7 from 60.3; business activity dropped to 55.2 from 61.5; employment fell to 50.4 from 53.1; prices, however, did tick higher at 60.0 from 58.2). Wells Fargo said the data suggests weakening in the US is now clearly no longer isolated to within the factory sector, and the odds of an FOMC October rate cut have risen (implied probability of a 25bps rate cut at the 30th October meeting rose to as high as 92.5% following the ISM release, compared to 77% on Wednesday, before paring to 85%).</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Fed's Evans</strong> (Voter, Dove) retained his 'open-mind' approach ahead of the 30th October FOMC. Evans argued that if there was an unexpected shock to the US or world economy, a modest policy response will not be nearly enough. When asked about the disappointing Manufacturing-ISM print, said it is an important data point, does not see this as an overreaction, and confirms the FOMC's view. Looking ahead, Evans reiterated his data-dependent stance, noting he will be watching Friday's payrolls data. <strong>Fed's Mester</strong> (non-voter, hawk) said the stability of inflation expectations is key to monetary policy; if prices are becoming more flexible due to Amazon and others, monetary policy is less effective. She noted that idiosyncratic factors were affecting the labour market and inflation. Mester also said that US monetary policy has been more accommodative than in the past, and she warned that, at some point, there are unintended policy consequences of running the economy too hot, which is forcing firms to turn to automation more quickly. On asset prices, Mester argued that non-financial debt, and commercial real estate levels are currently of moderate concern. <strong>Fed’s Kaplan</strong> <strong>(Non-Voter, Neutral) </strong>said two rate cuts this year reduce likelihood of a severe slowdown, however it does not eliminate it. Kaplan is watching services extremely carefully, but we should not overreact to one report. Adds, he is hearing from a lot of businesses they are putting things on hold amid trade uncertainty. Kaplan noted a strong consumer and tight labour market is underpinning the economy, and that time will tell if rate cuts have gone far enough. From a risk management perspective, he is more inclined to take action sooner if necessary. He reiterated that if we wait until weakness in broader economy manifests, we will have waited too long. Prior to this, Kaplan mentioned that negative rates in Europe, show there are limits to monetary policy; adding the Fed is allowing the economy to run hotter and the job market is tight, although inflation is not running away. Kaplan added monpol plays a role in boosting economic growth, however broader policies are needed, indicating there is a need from the fiscal side, a view many central bankers have been vocal about in recent weeks.</p><p><strong>* US/EU TRADE WAR:</strong> Following the WTO's judgement on Wednesday, the US said it would slap 10% tariffs on Airbus (AIR FP) planes and apply 25% duties on a range of other EU imports, including French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies, Spanish olives, certain pork products, and cheese. The tariffs will become effective on 18th September; with the Cheese Importers Association of America noting the USTR plans no grace period for products already in transit. The EU has this week warned against such an approach; the EU is awaiting a WTO decision on subsidies given to US defence company Boeing (BA) and has indicated it was prepared to retaliate in kind. UBS chief investment officer was framing the latest move as a tax on equity investors and expressed concern that the two sides do not seem to be trying to resolve the dispute, and that markets tend to worry about more taxes at a time of economic slowdown.</p><p><strong>* NONFARM PAYROLLS PREVIEW: </strong>Analysts expect to see a below-trend 145k nonfarm payrolls added to the US economy in September, with earnings growth seen at 0.3% M/M, and the jobless rate seen unchanged at 3.7%. Indicators are mixed going into the data: the ADP private payrolls gauge saw a small miss against expectations, while initial jobless claims have essentially moved sideways; Challenger’s job cuts data improved, though employers are beginning to see negative effect from trade wars; the employment sub-components within the ISM has pared back in the month; and on wages, consumer wage expectations has become a touch more pessimistic. Data will be released at 0830 EDT/1330 BST; with the Fed in data-dependent mode, it is also worth noting that Fed chair Powell will deliver remarks at 1400 EDT/1900 BST.&nbsp;To download the report, <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22920/download\">please click&nbsp;here.</a></p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> <strong>ECB's Rehn</strong> (dove) said the central bank needs to act strongly when inflation expectations are subdued for a prolonged period of time, in order to prevent them from being anchored at too low levels; ECB must try to avoid a prolonged period of low inflation with low rates, Rehn warned, since it would constrain the banks capacity to act. <strong>ECB's de Guindos</strong> (dove) reiterated that risks to the outlook for the Eurozone economy were tilted to the downside; says it is important to enhance the firepower of European stabilisation policy by using a mix of policies.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE PMI:</strong> September's final composite PMI printed 50.1 in September (consensus 50.4, Prev. 50.4); the final services gauge printed 51.6 (expected 52.0, Prev. 52.0). Markit said the Eurozone economy ground to a halt in September, and that the PMI surveys were painting the darkest picture since the current period of expansion began in mid-2013. Markit said GDP looks set to rise by 0.1% at best in Q3, with further signs momentum is being lost. The data will be enough to justify fears that the prospect of a recession in Q4 is a real possibility, Markit wrote. The downturn also shows further signs of spreading from manufacturing to services sector. \"The deteriorating picture is being led by a downturn in Germany, but France and Italy are also close to stalling and Spain has seen growth slow to the joint-lowest in around six years,\" the report noted, \"the growing risk of recession, coupled with a further moderation of inflationary pressures, will add to expectations that the ECB will need to do more to stimulate the economy in coming months.\"</p><p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>Wakatabe reiterated that the BoJ will act appropriately to a more accommodative stance if the situation worsens, adding trade issues were a downside risk, and the BoJ is aware it needs to be dealt with.</p><p><strong>* UK PMI:</strong> The UK Services fell to 49.5 in September, into contraction; analysts had expected a fall to 50.3 from 50.6 in August. The data means that the dominant services sector has now joined the manufacturing and construction sectors in contractionary territory. September's decline is ominous since it comes on the back of weakening of demand over the past year, rather than any sudden shock, Markit said, and the reading is consistent with GDP declining by 0.1% in Q3, which would come on the back of a decline in Q2, meaning the UK is now also looking down the barrel of a technical recession. Markit said that Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses. \"While the early summer had seen resilient jobs growth, the surveys indicate that employment is now falling at the fastest rate since December 2009,\" Markit's chief economist said, \"the increasingly dire readings push the surveys further into territory that would normally be associated with policy stimulus from the BOE, suggesting a greater likelihood that the next move in rates will be a cut.\"</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> While the EU appear to be taking a constructive but cool response to UK PM Johnson's Brexit proposal, the maths within the House of Commons appears to be slowly moving in favour of UK PM Johnson. One journalist noted that the government requires 320 votes in the Lower House to get its deal through; 318 (288 Tory MPs, 20 former Tory rebels, 10 DUP) would mean that the government requires only two labour votes to get it through - some reports suggest those numbers are there. There has been a suggestion that the government could move a vote in the lower house before the EU Summit on 17/18 October, which would certainly strengthen the UK's hand in negotiations (remember, May never managed to get a majority backing her, while Europeans have been reticent to offer deals to the UK on fears that it would not get through parliament, and thus, weaken the EU's hand). The EU, however, officially still remains \"open but still unconvinced\" by the Brexit plan; the Irish PM -- who will play a pivotal role in the EU's ultimate acceptance or rejection of the proposal -- says there are two main obstacles to the UK offer: customs proposal, as well as consent and democracy; his deputy, is also cool, stating that 'it will be no-deal if plan is final offer'. If the EU were to reject his proposals, Johnson does reportedly have a plan B. Plan B, according to people familiar with the matter, keeps the backstop arrangement for the Irish border, however with one condition, a clear time limit. The time limit backstop had reportedly been among discussions recently, however reports were quickly denied; therefore, it is likely the EU will not be pleased with the backup plan.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY CPI:</strong> CPI fell back into single digits (9.26% against an expected 9.6%, from a prior 15.01%), though analysts say it may be a result of base effects, and some expect the headline to tick up later this year. Nevertheless, the data is likely to allow Turkish President Erdogan to continue pressuring the CBRT to lower rates.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 19+ TICKS HIGHER AT 131-24:</strong> The curve bull steepened following a poor ISM print, which sent 10y-year notes to session highs. There was a reversal seen in equities on the news, however, yields remained toward session lows for the remainder of the session, as market pricing for a 25bp cut at the October meeting jumped to a high of 92.5% from 77% yesterday; expectations pared to around 85% by settlement. The short-end of the curve immediately fell as markets now almost fully price in a cut at the next meeting, resulting in 2s10s curve widening to 15bp. Elsewhere, US treasury&nbsp; is to sell 38bln in 3-year notes, 24bln in 10-year notes and 16bln in 30-year bonds next week, as expected.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>Crude benchmarks extended losses going into the US session on Thursday, with a weakening US ISM non-manufacturing providing no reprieve. Production fears have subsided markedly since the September 14th attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, after the Kingdom reassured the oil market of its readily available spare capacity and large reserves. Also easing supply shortage concerns was Russia's Deputy Energy Minister, who said that Russia had spare capacity of at least 500K BPD and can tap it within three months. As risk appetite (SPX) becomes a more dominant driver of oil markets again, the post ISM non-manufacturing rebound naturally brought crude off its lows (‘bad news is good news’); heading into Friday with the critical US payrolls report, the crude complex will likely take its cues from equity markets again.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (HK/IRAN/NK): </strong>The US and North Korea are to resume working level talks on Friday in Sweden, CNN reported, where the source said the North Koreans’ sense an opportunity currently, perceiving President Trump as “politically vulnerable” and “starving for a win” — which they believe could mean Trump is willing to be more flexible in negotiations to bring “tangible results”. In the wake of North Korea’s latest missile firing into Japanese waters, the US and Japan agreed that the missile test was provocative and such actions should cease, adding that they don’t set the stage for diplomacy. Over in Hong Kong, Chief Executive Carrie Lam is expected to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow, which is anticipated to be on an emergency regulation to ban protesters wearing face masks; overnight it was also reported Hong Kong is studying a curfew to contain protest violence.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.8% at 2911, NASDAQ-100 1.2% at 7638, Dow Jones 0.5% at 26202,</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.5%, Consumer Staples 0.7%, Energy 1.3%, Financials 0.2%, HealthCare 0.9%, Industrials 0.7%, Information Technology 1.2%, Materials 0.4%, Telecommunication Services 0.8%, Utilities 0.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) tumbled after reporting Q3 vehicle deliveries, which failed to achieve the 100k figure touted by CEO Elon Musk last week (according to a leaked email). PepsiCo (PEP) surged as it beat Q3 top and bottom-lines, and issued a supportive FY outlook; conversely, Constellation Brands (STZ) dived after a write down in Canopy Growth (CGC). Netflix (NFLX) weighed on indices amid a negative mention at Needham as well as Italy opening a tax evasion probe into the streaming company. Arista Networks (ANET) and Delta Air Line (DAL) suffered with gratitude to downgrades at Nomura Instinet and Deutsche Bank, respectively. Mosaic (MOS) was hit after BMO said the agriculture bubble has popped. SunTrust began coverage of 14 cloud names, with CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Okata (OKTA) at Buy ratings, seeing both stocks outperform on the day.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Near the bottom of the G10 table sits the <strong>dollar</strong>, which sunk on much weaker than expected ISM Non-manufacturing data. <strong>DXY</strong> convincingly losing its grip on the 99.00 handle and settling around 98.70, giving support to <strong>EUR</strong>, which jumped from 1.0960 to top out around 1.10. Prior to the US data, <strong>GBP</strong> had already been making strides, buoyed by the prospect of UK PM Johnson’s new Brexit proposal seemingly gaining support among UK lawmakers (and despite abysmal Services PMI). Not far behind it, the <strong>antipodes</strong> bounced back after making fresh YTD lows yesterday, with some arguing an upturn in <strong>CNH</strong> acted as supportive, alongside confirmation from US President Trump that a Chinese trade team will be turning up in Washington for talks next week. EMFX was generally firm, though <strong>TRY</strong> is flat after CPI fell sharply, increasing the prospects of another CBRT rate cut.</p>",

Production fears have subsided markedly since the September 14th attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, after the Kingdom reassured the oil market of its readily available spare capacity and large reserves. Also easing supply shortage concerns was Russia's Deputy Energy Minister, who said that Russia had spare capacity of at least 500K BPD and can tap it within three months. As risk appetite (SPX) becomes a more dominant driver of oil markets again, the post ISM non-manufacturing rebound naturally brought crude off its lows (‘bad news is good news’); heading into Friday with the critical US payrolls report, the crude complex will likely take its cues from equity markets again.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has been dragged even lower in wake of another gloomy ISM survey as the services headline also missed consensus, albeit holding above the 50 break-even line unlike the more contractionary manufacturing reading earlier in the week. Amidst widespread declines for the Greenback vs G10 and EM peers, the <strong>DXY</strong> hit lows of 98.626 vs 99.194 at best as US Treasury yields fell and the curve re-flattened amidst increasingly dovish Fed policy pricing (October FOMC probability for a 25 bp ease up to 90%+).</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound had already recouped its UK services PMI losses and more before the latest Buck slide, but Cable sharply extended gains beyond 1.2300, through stops above Tuesday’s peak (1.2339), then 1.2350, the 10 and 21 DMAs (1.2356 and 1.2379 respectively) and over 1.2400 to 1.2410 at best. However, Sterling also outperformed against the Euro and other currency counterparts on a reserved, but not resounding response from the EU to PM Johnson’s Brexit grand plan, with Eur/Gbp down through 0.8850 and not far from the 200 DMA (0.8833) at one stage. Back to Cable, 1.2433 is the 100 DMA and next line of resistance.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although the Pound leapt to the top of the major league, Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd rallied on the aforementioned Greenback dump, as the former managed to reclaim 0.6300+ status and latter breached 0.6700 with more vigour to test offers near 0.6750. The Aussie may also have drawn encouragement from an upturn in the <strong>YUAN</strong> and confirmation from US President Trump that a Chinese trade team will be turning up in Washington for talks next week.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>The Yen maintained a bid for the most part around the 107.00 handle against the Dollar, but extended to circa 106.50 before losing some momentum when the US services ISM shock wore off, and perhaps attention started to switch to NFP on Friday. Meanwhile, Eur/Jpy got agonisingly close to an unusually hefty option expiry at 117.00 (1.5 bn), but the single currency was also a beneficiary of Greenback weakness and Eur/Usd cleared an upside chart hurdle above 1.0950 before the NY cut on its way to 1.0999 (just shy of the 21DMA at 1.1001 besides 1.1000 from a psychological standpoint).</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>Narrowly mixed vs their US compatriot, with the Loonie paring losses from almost 1.3350, but unable to pierce 1.3300 against the backdrop of weak oil prices, while the Franc remains hampered by multiple negative factors, including the ECJ judgement on Chf mortgages in Poland, but mostly reports of official intervention that could be borne out by the next weekly Swiss sight deposit update.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Widespread gains at the expense of the forlorn Usd, but the Try lagging in wake of softer than forecast Turkish inflation data that will increase pressure on the CBRT to continue unwinding/reversing tight policy. Conversely, the Zar outperformed alongside the Brl on positive Eskom and Pension factors respectively.</p>",

Indicators are mixed going into the data: the ADP private payrolls gauge saw a small miss against expectations, while initial jobless claims have essentially moved sideways; Challenger’s job cuts data improved, though employers are beginning to see negative effect from trade wars; the employment sub-components within the ISM has pared back in the month; and on wages, consumer wage expectations has become a touch more pessimistic. Data will be released at 0830 EDT/1330 BST; with the Fed in data-dependent mode, it is also worth noting that Fed chair Powell will deliver remarks at 1400 EDT/1900 BST. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/22920/download\"><strong>here</strong></a></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

Meanwhile, upside in the <strong>Hang Seng (+0.3%)</strong> was hindered by losses in oil giant CNOOC following a downgrade at Daiwa Securities, whilst HSBC and other financials rested near the bottom of the index amid lower yields and against the backdrop of ongoing protests, as demonstrators staged overnight vandalism and targeted Mainland China-linked businesses, and with reports of Hong Kong studying methods to contain the protest violence.

A person such as a police or other disciplined force is not subject to a ban on duty or on his way to and from duty, the article said.

US said it would be ready to respond if the EU invokes further than the WTO tariff authority in retaliation. US also said it is willing to negotiate with the EU to settle aircraft case, but past EU offers have not been adequate. Sources stated that the US has requested an emergency meeting of the WTO dispute body for October 14th, a signal of fast movements for tariffs on EU goods, the sources added.

Markets appear to have stabilised in wake of yesterday/last night’s steep declines seen across global equity markets, ahead of further crucial macro-economic data in the form of US ISM non-manufacturing today, and NFP tomorrow. After the WTO ruled yesterday that the US could hit the EU with tariffs on USD 7.5bln worth of imports, a retaliation for the bloc’s illegal subsidising of Airbus, the USTR office unveiled the details of the tariffs; EU aircraft will be hit with 10% tariffs, while other agriculture and industrial goods (including on Whisky, Wine and Cheese) will be hit with 25% tariffs, with the tariffs to take effect on October 18th. Europe will retaliate, when the WTO rules on its complaints over US subsidies for Boeing, although any decision is unlikely until the end of the year. European stocks feared to have been worst affected by possible US tariffs cheered the announcement, implying a softer response by the US than some had feared; aircraft maker Airbus (+3.5%), luxury goods makers LVMH (+1.8%) and Kering (+1.1%) and beverage makers Pernod Ricard (+3.2%) and Diageo (+1.5%) all outperform. The sectors paint a mixed picture; Industrials (+0.1%) and the consumer sectors are firmer, reflecting strength in the above-mentioned names. Energy (-0.4%) continued to underperform, amid a catch up to recent declines in oil prices and with the overhang of yesterday’s decision by Norway’s Wealth Fund to sell oil &amp; gas stocks worth approx. USD 5.9bln still weighing. Other notable individual movers include; Ted Baker (-35.7%) sunk after the co. posted disappointing earnings and warned of very difficult trading conditions and that full-year results could fall short. Sika (+3.2%) caught a bid on the news that the Co. had announced a new strategy, where it increased its long-term EBIT margin target to 15-18% from the prior 14-18%. Finally, Ingenico Group (+2.7%) saw strength after Berenberg initiated the co. with a buy.</p><p><strong>Tesla (TSLA) –</strong> Co’s Q3 deliveries missed on Exp., Co. are down around 4% in pre-market trade.

The composite index has followed suite and IHS/Markit is now predicting a 0.1% q/q GDP dip for Q3 that would be enough to tip the economy into a technical recession. However, Sterling is resisting downside pressure and potential dovish BoE implications ahead of a speech by Tenreyro, as Cable keeps tabs with 1.2300 and Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8900 amidst mixed EU assessments on the latest Brexit proposals from PM Johnson. The rationale appears to be that while there is no sign that differences over the Irish backstop have been bridged, there maybe scope for further negotiation and/or sufficient grounds to warrant another Article 50 extension even if Boris is adamant about leaving at the end of this month, deal or no deal.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/SEK - </strong>The G10 laggards, with the Franc succumbing to additional negative vibes following the ECJ ruling on Polish Chf denominated mortgages, but off par-plus lows vs the Dollar that is still feeling the adverse effects of Tuesday’s downbeat US non-manufacturing PMI (DXY straddling 99.000 ahead of today’s services PMI, ISM and raft of data). Elsewhere, the Loonie has retreated further amidst ongoing weakness in crude prices, with Usd/Cad finally breaching 1.3300 and the 200 DMA (1.3295) before absorbing offers at 1.3310 on the way towards 1.3340, while Eur/NOK scales 10.0000. Nevertheless, the Norwegian Crown is faring better than its Scandinavian neighbour after Sweden’s services PMI tracked the manufacturing index into contractionary territory and propelled Eur/Sek up to almost 10.8500 and ytd peaks only a few pips above.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY - </strong>The single currency has also displayed resilience in the face of mostly disappointing Eurozone services PMIs and more evidence of deflation via PPI data, although again partly if not largely at the behest or bequest of the Buck, as Eur/Usd trades on the 1.0950 axis and eyeing decent option expiries at 1.0970 (1.2 bn) and 1.1000 (1.7 bn). Similarly, the Yen is confined between 107.30-106.98 parameters, albeit the headline pair in a lower band with expiry interest layered from 107.00-05 (1.2 bn) through 107.50-60 (1 bn) to 107.65-75 (1.2 bn). Note also, a big expiry in Eur/Jpy resides at the 117.00 strike (1.5 bn) and the cross is currently at the lower end of a 117.64-26 range.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Usd/Try remains in retracement mode after upside resistance was respected/rejected yesterday, but off lows in wake of Turkish CPI that missed already very soft expectations and could force the CBRT to ease further, or at least up Government pressure on the CB to cut rates again.</p><p><strong>Notable Option Expiries:</strong></p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.0900 (800M), 1.0930 (460M), <strong>1.0970 (1.2BLN), 1.1000 (1.7BLN)</strong></p><p>- USD/JPY: <strong>107.00-05 (1.2BLN), 107.50-60 (1BLN), 107.65-75 (1.2BLN)</strong></p><p>- EUR/JPY: <strong>117.00 (1.5BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Core debt futures have dipped from best levels, but retain a firm bid on multiple bullish factors like broadly bleak services PMIs, Brexit uncertainty, global tariff angst and geopolitical strains, not to mention the growing dovish intimations for Central Banks.

Comments/updates from energy ministers did little to move the dial for the complex; the Saudi Energy Minister Abdilaziz said the country has capacity back at 11.3mln BPD, although production has stabilised at 9.9mln BDP (in line with OPEC+ production cut commitments), while Venezuela’s Energy Minister said production is currently below 1mln bpd. Russian Energy Minister Novak, speaking about global demand, said 2019 global oil demand is to grow by 1.0-1.1mln BPD and oil demand growth is to recover in 2020 following a weak 2019. He added that there is no need for an extraordinary OPEC+ meeting at the present. With Saudi production now back at pre-attack levels, and geopolitical risk premia appearing to recede, the focus of crude markets appears to have returned to the global economy; as such, todays US ISM non-manufacturing and tomorrow’s NFP are likely to be pivotal determinants of near-term direction. Following yesterday’s bid that took the precious metal back above the USD 1500/oz mark, <strong>Gold prices</strong> appear to have stabilised, awaiting further impetus in the form of the important aforementioned economic data releases over the next two days. <strong>Copper,</strong> meanwhile, slid towards yesterday’s lows around the USD 2.550/lbs mark, as a boost to the red metal from a softer buck faded.</p><p>ANZ Bank revised down its 2019 oil demand growth forecast to 1.0mln BPD (Prev. 1.2mln BPD); ANZ still expects balance to tighten in Q4 2019.

        "subject": "Nomura say a risk on mood could take hold between 10-15 October",
        "content": "<ul><li>According to Nomura, the average historical pattern in global stock market sentiment under similar conditions suggests sentiment is to remain fragile, and risk a further swing back from earlier optimism, until 9 October. Investors, they say, especially the quickest movers, appear primed to overreact to bad news, regardless of its content or even its validity. However, the bank suggests that if the present risk-off phase sticks to a more or less predictable pattern, they would then expect a risk-on mood to take hold for a brief time, from 10 October through 15 October, and, as such, warns against chasing downside in global equities for now. However, should the risk on phase fail to materialise, “the pressure on CTAs and other investors to back out of long positions in equities may again gain the upper hand” posits the bank. Moreover, “if CTAs were to close out the entirety of their aggregate long position in US equity futures, we think the systematic selling climax would probably arrive between 16 and 22 October.”</li><li>Nomura say stock market sentiment in continental Europe and the UK has fallen into negative territory, with sentiment in the UK falling to a YTD low. The bank reminds us that European sentiment generally tends to fall in line with the trend in macroeconomic performance. As such, “it appears that European equity market participants are starting to lower their sights back down to a level more in tune with Europe's fragile economic reality” Nomura say. In terms of systematic players; CTAs have been exiting the long position that they accumulated in the month of September in European equity futures since 30 September, especially since indices fell below the “trigger lines” at 3500 for Euro Stoxx 50, 7300 for FTSE 100 and 12300 for DAX futures. According to the bank, since these lines were crossed, CTAs have cleared 35, 40 and 50% of their long positions in each of these index futures respectively and unless these lines are quickly crossed to the upside again, CTAs are likely to continue to unwind their positions.</li><li>Turning to US equities; Nomura note the steep sell-off yesterday and say that, in addition to trend-chasing systematic investor selling pressure, global macro hedge funds which had been optimistic about economic fundamentals also stepped up the pace of their exit from long positions. However, the bank caveats, “the situation looks different now than it did in October 2018, as a fair number of investors appear to have been braced for a spike in volatility this time around, and there is little evidence of cascading panic selling.” Upcoming data and US/China trade talks on 10-11 October are a wild card, Nomura concedes, but if US stock market indices fail to regain 2,970 (for the S&amp;P 500), 7,750 (for the NASDAQ 100), and 26,680 (for the DJIA) next week, CTAs will probably bump up the speed of their exits from long positions in US equity futures again, mainly to cut losses. Based on a simulation run by the bank, this “fire sale would reach its zenith between 16 and 22 October.”</li></ul>",

The composite index has followed suite and IHS/Markit is now predicting a 0.1% q/q GDP dip for Q3 that would be enough to tip the economy into a technical recession. However, Sterling is resisting downside pressure and potential dovish BoE implications ahead of a speech by Tenreyro, as Cable keeps tabs with 1.2300 and Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8900 amidst mixed EU assessments on the latest Brexit proposals from PM Johnson. The rationale appears to be that while there is no sign that differences over the Irish backstop have been bridged, there maybe scope for further negotiation and/or sufficient grounds to warrant another Article 50 extension even if Boris is adamant about leaving at the end of this month, deal or no deal.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/SEK</strong></p><p>The G10 laggards, with the Franc succumbing to additional negative vibes following the ECJ ruling on Polish Chf denominated mortgages, but off par-plus lows vs the Dollar that is still feeling the adverse effects of Tuesday’s downbeat US non-manufacturing PMI (<strong>DXY </strong>straddling 99.000 ahead of today’s services PMI, ISM and raft of data). Elsewhere, the Loonie has retreated further amidst ongoing weakness in crude prices, with Usd/Cad finally breaching 1.3300 and the 200 DMA (1.3295) before absorbing offers at 1.3310 on the way towards 1.3340, while Eur/<strong>NOK </strong>scales 10.0000. Nevertheless, the Norwegian Crown is faring better than its Scandinavian neighbour after Sweden’s services PMI tracked the manufacturing index into contractionary territory and propelled Eur/Sek up to almost 10.8500 and ytd peaks only a few pips above.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The single currency has also displayed resilience in the face of mostly disappointing Eurozone services PMIs and more evidence of deflation via PPI data, although again partly if not largely at the behest or bequest of the Buck, as Eur/Usd trades on the 1.0950 axis and eyeing decent option expiries at 1.0970 (1.2 bn) and 1.1000 (1.7 bn). Similarly, the Yen is confined between 107.30-106.98 parameters, albeit the headline pair in a lower band with expiry interest layered from 107.00-05 (1.2 bn) through 107.50-60 (1 bn) to 107.65-75 (1.2 bn). Note also, a big expiry in Eur/Jpy resides at the 117.00 strike (1.5 bn) and the cross is currently at the lower end of a 117.64-26 range.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Usd/Try remains in retracement mode after upside resistance was respected/rejected yesterday, but off lows in wake of Turkish CPI that missed already very soft expectations and could force the CBRT to ease further, or at least up Government pressure on the CB to cut rates again.</p>",

US said it would be ready to respond if the EU invokes further than the WTO tariff authority in retaliation. US also said it is willing to negotiate with the EU to settle aircraft case, but past EU offers have not been adequate. Sources stated that the US has requested an emergency meeting of the WTO dispute body for October 14th, a signal of fast movements for tariffs on EU goods, the sources added.

EU believe PM Johnson is willing to negotiate further in Brussels, but it does not mean EU thinks a deal is likely by mid-October. <strong>An EU source also noted that the proposal “is a million miles away from being acceptable”</strong>, Sky News’ Lewis Goodall tweeted. (Twitter) Meanwhile, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator Verhofstadt said the initial reaction from the EU's Steering Group to UK's proposals were not positive, a full written statement will be provided today.

Senior European diplomatic sources noted that the request for an extension until January 31st could come from “the head of government or head of state” which means either the PM or a representative of the Crown. Should the PM refuse to sign or send the extension letter, a Whitehall source said the letter could be sent by Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill or UK’s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow.</strong> <strong>Furthermore, diplomats stated that no European leader has reached the point of wanting to veto an extension</strong>.

Irish PM said he wants a deal agreed and ratified and will speak to Johnson again next week. DUP Deputy Leader Dodds said nothing can be done in regard to the regulatory divergence between the UK and NI without Unionist consent, so it is \"no change whatsoever\". UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Gove said that with DUP, Conservative switchers and some Labour MPs on board, UK PM Johnson's has a very good chance of getting through parliament. (Newswires/ITV)</p><p><strong>UK Government sources said that UK PM Johnson needs to know by this weekend whether the EU regards his offer as the basis for a final deal.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> remained in a tight range on either side of 1500/oz with little by way of catalysts ahead of key data releases and a slew of Fed speakers, whilst <strong>copper</strong> posted mild gains as the red metal side-lined sentiment and capitalised on the recent Dollar weakness.</p><p>ANZ Bank revised down its 2019 oil demand growth forecast to 1.0mln BPD (Prev. 1.2mln BPD); ANZ still expects balance to tighten in Q4 2019.

The curve continued to bull steepen throughout the session with CME market expectations for an October rate cut rising to 77%, compared to 55% priced in the wake of Tuesday’s ISM manufacturing data and 40% before it.

        "content": "<p>Asian equities track losses seen on Wall Street which saw the DJIA fall below its 100 DMA (~26400) and briefly dip below the 26k level as the trade landscape took a turn for the worse with the US set to impose tariffs on EU goods on October 18th. ASX 200 (-2.4%) is led lower by heavyweight financials and miners whilst the Nikkei 225 (-2.1%) was pressured by a firmer domestic currency. Meanwhile, upside in the Hang Seng (-0.8%) is hindered by oil giant CNOOC following a downgrade at Daiwa Securities, whilst HSBC and other financials rest near the bottom of the index amid lower yields and against the backdrop of ongoing protests, with demonstrators staging overnight vandalism and targeting Mainland China-linked businesses, and with Hong Kong reportedly studying methods to contain the protest violence. Elsewhere, Mainland China and South Korean markets are closed today due to public holidays.</p><p>In FX Markets, the DXY trades flat on either side of 99.00 following the recent weakness seen in lieu of the decade-low ISM Manufacturing metric and a weaker-than-forecast ADP survey, with attention now on the US ISM Non-manufacturing PMI ahead of Friday’s US labour market report. EUR/USD and GBP/USD trade sideways above 1.0950 and around 1.2300 respectively with the former eyeing 1.2bln in options expiring at strike 1.0970 at the NY cut, and the latter somewhat underpinned by reports that the EU will grant another Brexit extension even if the request is not signed by PM Johnson, who has repeated on countless occasions that Brexit will happen on October 31st, with or without a deal. USD/JPY edged lower earlier in the session and briefly dipped below 107.00 amid the current risk-environment, whilst in terms of technicals, the pair sees its 50 and 100 DMA at 107.02 and 107.73 respectively. Elsewhere, the antipodeans are little changed, AUD/USD defends its 0.67+ status despite a narrower-than-forecast August trade balance, meanwhile its Kiwi counterpart remains north of 0.6250.</p>",
