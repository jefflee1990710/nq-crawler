BA missed on EPS but beat on revenue and notes that it assumed that regulatory approval of its 737 MAX return will begin in Q4 (unchanged from prior guidance). Other Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) also reported figures which saw it as low as 7% in pre-market trade following a miss on both EPS and revenue, citing weaker China sales, as well as a cut in its FY EPS, worse than expectations; however, the stock impressively clawed back losses just prior to the open and traded in the green for the remainder of the session. CAT did note that it does expect stimulus in China to help its construction business and that it continues to see mining in the early stages of recovery. Texas instruments (TXN) beat on EPS, however missed on revenue, and guided Q4 EPS between (USD) 0.91 and 1.09, lower than the consensus view for 1.28, Q4 revenue was also guided beneath expectations. The poor guidance and fall in Analog revenue hit the semiconductor sector as the SOX traded lower by 2% on Wednesday, with Analog Devices (ADI), MicroChip (MCHP) and Applied Materials (AMAT) underperforming in the space along with TXN. Eli Lilly (LLY) reversed some its successful phase 3 gains yesterday after its earnings report this morning which saw EPS beats and revenues in line, however its sales on a key drug were weaker than expected which saw the stock open lower by ~6%, although losses did claw back gradually throughout the session as it closed the session ~2.5% lower. Rollins (ROL), Invesco (IVZ), Avery Dennison (AVY), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Pentair (PNR), Boston Scientific (BSX), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Hilton (HLT) all outperformers from strong earnings.&nbsp; Chipotle (CMG) reported strong earnings and strong comparable SSS, however the reduction in cumulative 2019 and 2020 store openings hit the stock today as it traded in the red. Snap (SNAP) also traded lower despite earnings beats, with its guidance weak. S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3005, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 7889, Dow Jones 0.2% at 26834.</p><p>The T-Note failed to show any any conviction on either side throughout Wednesday trade. Today’s US 5-year auction appeared solid as it stopped through 0.4bps with a B/C of 2.41, higher than the 6-auction average of 2.37x. Indirect’s took a large portion of 65.7%, above the average 58%. Directs took 11.5% lower than the average take of 16.7%, which left dealers taking a rather small 22.8% in comparison to the 25.3% 6-auction average. At settlement yields were fractionally lower. US T-note (Z9) settled 1+ ticks higher at 129.27+.</p>",

The general run of commentary seems to indicate that the EU will grant an extension, though reports note the frustration among policymakers over the dragging process. Ireland's PM Varadkar has said he would endorse an extension, which analysts said increased the chances the EU would agree; a decision could come at the end of this week/early next week. The EU noted they will be discussing the matter on Friday with no decision expected today, but diplomats noted the most likely extension will be to 31st Jan 2020, however France and some others still reportedly prefer a shorter extension, with French President Macron reportedly is demanding a new Brexit deadline on the 15th of November.&nbsp; The key takeaway is that UK PM Johnson will probably not be able to deliver Brexit by 31st October, as he has pledged to do repeatedly (even after losing the vote yesterday). On a domestic basis, a meeting between Johnson and opposition leader Corbyn yielded little in terms of a path forward, leaving the deadlock in place. Johnson continues to push for a short extension, while the EU Brexit Steering Group has said it would not recommend an extension beyond 31st January 2020 (in line with the request under the Benn Act), with any longer extension likely to prompt the Government to call a snap election.</p><p><strong>* ECB PREVIEW: </strong>ECB monetary policy decision due at 12:45BST, (13:45CET, 07:45ET), on Thursday 24th October 2019, press conference due at 13:30BST, (14:30CET, 08:30ET). This week’s policy announcement from the ECB will likely draw far less attention than the one in September which saw policymakers unveil a raft of easing measures to help aide the Eurozone economy. Instead, this week’s meeting will likely focus on recently announced measures, the need for fiscal assistance and Draghi’s tenure at the Bank in what will be his last meeting before handing over the reins to Christine Lagarde.

Preceding the speech, Turkish Defence Minister Akar said he expects the disagreements with the US on the F-35 project will be overcome and that sanctions would be temporary; he added that Turkey could buy US patriot missile defenses and will listen to Germany's safe zone proposals on Thursday.</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>China State Council said it would keep the Yuan exchange rate basically stable, and maintain reasonable FX reserves; it added that it would continue to stabilise foreign investment and trade, and will also improve exports tax rebates system and increase imports of goods such as agricultural, consumer products and components.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3005, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 7889, Dow Jones 0.2% at 26834</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.4%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy 0.8%, Financials 0.4%, Health Care 0.6%, Industrials 0%, Information Technology 0.1%, Materials 0.7%, Telecommunication Services 0.6%, Utilities 0.4%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Dow heavyweight Boeing (BA) reported, where it initially traded lower in the pre-market but rose to intra day highs of around 4% at the open, albeit the gains were short lived as it closed the day marginally higher. BA missed on EPS but beat on revenue and notes that it assumed that regulatory approval of its 737 MAX return will begin in Q4 (unchanged from prior guidance). Other Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) also reported figures which saw it as low as 7% in pre-market trade following a miss on both EPS and revenue, citing weaker China sales, as well as a cut in its FY EPS, worse than expectations; however, the stock impressively clawed back losses just prior to the open and traded in the green for the remainder of the session. CAT did note that it does expect stimulus in China to help its construction business and that it continues to see mining in the early stages of recovery. Texas instruments (TXN) beat on EPS, however missed on revenue, and guided Q4 EPS between (USD) 0.91 and 1.09, lower than the consensus view for 1.28, Q4 revenue was also guided beneath expectations. The poor guidance and fall in Analog revenue hit the semiconductor sector as the SOX traded lower by 2% on Wednesday, with Analog Devices (ADI), MicroChip (MCHP) and Applied Materials (AMAT) underperforming in the space along with TXN. Eli Lilly (LLY) reversed some its successful phase 3 gains yesterday after its earnings report this morning which saw EPS beats and revenues in line, however its sales on a key drug were weaker than expected which saw the stock open lower by ~6%, although losses did claw back gradually throughout the session as it closed the session ~2.5% lower. Rollins (ROL), Invesco (IVZ), Avery Dennison (AVY), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Pentair (PNR), Boston Scientific (BSX), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Hilton (HLT) all outperformers from strong earnings.&nbsp; Chipotle (CMG) reported strong earnings and strong comparable SSS, however the reduction in cumulative 2019 and 2020 store openings hit the stock today as it traded in the red. Snap (SNAP) also traded lower despite earnings beats, with its guidance weak.</p><p><strong>*STORIES:</strong> Facebook (FB) CEO Zuckerberg held a hearing today with US politicians where he stated he would pull out of the Libra Association if it did not gain US approval. Nike (NKE) traded in the red following the departure of CEO Parker, with former ServiceNow (NOW), John Donahoe, to be the successor. NOW trade lower by 5% heading into their earnings report tonight. Coca Cola (KO) traded higher from an upgrade at UBS and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) traded lower after a downgrade at JPM.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 1.49 HIGHER AT USD 55.97/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 1.47 HIGHER AT 61.17/BBL: </strong>Crude prices were firmer on Wednesday, with upside seen at the energy cash open and then exacerbated after a surprise draw in headline EIA crude inventories – this draw was in contrast with API data from the night before, which showed a 4.5mln barrel build. The EIA inventory internals were more mixed; Gasoline stocks drew more than expected (-3.1mln vs exp. -2.3mln), Distillates drew in line with expectations (-2.7mln vs exp. -2.8mln) and Cushing rose by 1.5mln, while US daily production remained unchanged at 12.6mln BPD; net imports fell to their lowest recorded level, too. The WTI Dec’ 19 futures managed to poke above resistance (11 October high) around the USD 55.00/bbl mark, while Brent Dec’ 19 futures managed to retake the USD 60.00/bbl level. Both contracts now sit at/near the top of their October ranges. Earlier in the session, the complex had seen some downside on comments from Russia’s Energy Minister Novak, saying he had no information regarding possible discussions on deeper oil production cuts at the OPEC+ December meeting and added that there had been no official proposals on changing the OPEC+ deal as of yet - seemingly a rebuttal to recent source reports that OPEC and allies are to consider deeper oil cuts at its December 5/6th meetings due to weak demand growth outlook in 2020. Novak did however caveat that this position could be tweaked; Citi note that it is not unusual for no proposals to have been made this far ahead of the December 5-6 summit in Vienna to review policy.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 1+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129.27+. </strong>The T-Note failed to show any any conviction on either side throughout Wednesday trade<strong>. </strong>Today’s US 5-year auction appeared solid as it stopped through 0.4bps with a B/C of 2.41, higher than the 6-auction average of 2.37x. Indirect’s took a large portion of 65.7%, above the average 58%. Directs took 11.5% lower than the average take of 16.7%, which left dealers taking a rather small 22.8% in comparison to the 25.3% 6-auction average. At settlement yields were fractionally lower.</p><p><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The September auction was decent, stopping through the screens by 0.5bps (largest stop through since March). Analysts at SocGen say the 7-year note trades fair in asset swap compared to older 7s, though trades rich on the curve versus 5s and 10s. The bank also notes that the current when issued yield is trading above last month's stop out rate, which may provide some support for the auction. Additionally, it is worth keeping in mind that, earlier on Thursday, the ECB policy meeting may influence action heading into the auction, while desks will also be wary of ongoing Brexit headline risk.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE CONSUMER SENTIMENT: </strong>Headline consumer confidence fell by more than expected (-7.6 against an expected -6.8, from a prior -6.8). Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the data was another soft survey, though the headline consumer sentiment index just about remains within the range it has settled in recently, after the collapse through most of last year; however, there are no details in the report, so it is difficult to draw significant conclusions. \"The overall trend in these data have been split between a relatively solid outlook for consumers’ own financial situation contrasted by a rapidly falling outlook for the economy as a whole,\" PM says, \"we suspect that the latter fell further at the start of Q4; elsewhere, the downside surprise also points to an underwhelming headline EC economic sentiment index next week.\"</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: GBP</strong> traded firmer today paring back some of the post government defeat losses from last night as the chance of a no-deal continues to evaporate despite UK PM Johnson’s common motive to leave the EU in 8 days time, as the EU’s most likely next step is to offer a 3-month extension to avoid a no-deal. <strong>EUR </strong>was slightly firmer despite poor EZ consumer confidence with participants focusing on tomorrow’s events with ECB President Draghi’s final policy meeting as-well as preliminary EZ PMI’s. <strong>Haven’s </strong>were mixed today as JPY was weaker, with USDJPY still facing offers into 109 with participants mindful of the 200dma at 109.08 if the risk appetite were to improve. <strong>CHF</strong> also lower today, however XAU traded firmer heading towards the magnetic 1500 level seeing highs of 1495 from 1487 lows, a weaker buck likely contributed to the gains. <strong>CAD </strong>was firmer despite wholesale trade falling, although the Loonie was focused on the soaring oil prices today as the exporting nation favoured the price moves. In EMFX, <strong>MXN </strong>&amp; <strong>BRL</strong> were firmer with the latter outperforming following the senate approval on its long-awaited pension reform bill, <strong>ZAR </strong>weaker on softer CPI.</p><p><strong>* NORGES PREVIEW: </strong>Norges Bank Rate Decision, Thursday 24th October 0900BST/1000CET. Expectations are for the Norges Bank to leave its Key Policy Rate unchanged at 1.50%. Recent rhetoric has been in-line with the September rate path; notably, core CPI came in above the Norges Bank’s forecast.<strong> </strong>To download the report, please click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23064/download\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK PREVIEW: </strong>Riksbank Rate Decision, Thursday 24th October 0830BST/0930CET. The Repo Rate is expected to be left unchanged at -0.25%; thus focus will, once again, be on any changes to the repo path. Recent commentary has been mixed, and in-line CPIF may be sufficient to justify maintaining the hiking bias.<strong> </strong>To download the report, please click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23063/download\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>* CBRT PRIMER: </strong>CBRT is expected to cut rates by 100bps. 18 out of 20 analysts surveyed by Reuters are expecting a cut, with the largest estimate for 200bps, whilst two expect rates to remain unchanged. Rate decision 12:00 BST/07:00 ET on 24th October 2019. To download the report, please click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23067/download\">here</a>.</p>",

The EIA inventory internals were more mixed; Gasoline stocks drew more than expected (-3.1mln vs exp. -2.3mln), Distillates drew in line with expectations (-2.7mln vs exp. -2.8mln) and Cushing rose by 1.5mln, while US daily production remained unchanged at 12.6mln BPD; net imports fell to their lowest recorded level, too. The WTI Dec’ 19 futures managed to poke above resistance (11 October high) around the USD 55.00/bbl mark, while Brent Dec’ 19 futures managed to retake the USD 60.00/bbl level. Both contracts now sit at/near the top of their October ranges. Earlier in the session, the complex had seen some downside on comments from Russia’s Energy Minister Novak, saying he had no information regarding possible discussions on deeper oil production cuts at the OPEC+ December meeting and added that there had been no official proposals on changing the OPEC+ deal as of yet - seemingly a rebuttal to recent source reports that OPEC and allies are to consider deeper oil cuts at its December 5/6th meetings due to weak demand growth outlook in 2020. Novak did however caveat that this position could be tweaked; Citi note that it is not unusual for no proposals to have been made this far ahead of the December 5-6 summit in Vienna to review policy.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu); Analysts at UBS note that there are around USD 84bln of cash flows at the end-month settlement (excluding SOMA holdings), including around USD 75bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>5-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> the previous 5-year auction was soft, tailing by 0.9bps, and cover coming in below recent averages. But analysts at SocGen suggest that the 5-year sector has slight set-up ahead of Wednesday's auction from a relative value perspective, noting that the current 5-year trades cheap in asset swap compared to older 5s, and also trades cheap on the curve compared to 2s and 10s. SocGen believes that the auction will still need some concession, since the current WI yield is low when compared to previous stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness on an outright basis versus the previous auction cycles. SocGen also says that relatively low dealer holdings in the 3-6-year bucket should marginally support demand. The bank says it is neutral on the auction.</p><p><strong>5-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High Yield:</strong> (Prev. 1.600%, six-auction average 1.827%)</li><li><strong>Tail:</strong> (Prev. 0.9bps tail, six-auction average 0.2bps)</li><li><strong>Bid-to-Cover:</strong> (Prev. 2.32x, six-auction average 2.37x)</li><li><strong>Dealers:</strong> (Prev. 27.0%, six-auction average 25.3%)</li><li><strong>Directs:</strong> (Prev. 14.2%, six-auction average 16.7%)</li><li><strong>Indirects:</strong> (Prev. 58.8%, six-auction average 58.0%)</li></ul>",

However, whilst the consensus homes in on 100bps, the actual figure is susceptible to gyrations, as the previous meetings have made clear, although a cut is almost a certainty given President Erdogan’s persistent pressure on the CBRT to continue lowering rates, and newly appointed Governor Uysal has not disappointed to date. Since the last policy meeting, the Turkish offensive into Northern Syria has seen investors shed Lira holdings, reducing policymakers’ scope for further easing (at least from a market perspective or perception), but the Lira has pared losses somewhat as tensions have cooled within the week prior to Thursday's meeting, with the “ceasefire” serving as a shoe-in for cuts this week. Additionally, Turkish inflation has continued to cool, in support of further cuts, with CPI Y/Y down to 9.26% in September (prev. 15.01%), a previous headwind for the CBRT that has walked the policy tightrope of runaway inflation and a struggling economy.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has reclaimed 0.6400+ status vs its US peer and pole position in the G10 rankings, but only just and partly due to favourable cross winds as Aud/Nzd slips further from 1.0700+ overnight highs and the Aussie continues to fade after falling short on multiple advances towards 0.6900 against the Greenback. Meanwhile, the Pound has pared worst losses in wake of the latest Brexit setback, as attention switches to how long the EU will grant in terms of a further extension, what conditions are attached to a technical or longer delay from October 31 and whether UK PM Johnson attempts to thwart remainers via a snap election or tries to get a longer Programme Motion approved. Cable is holding above recent lows and not too far from 1.2900, while Eur/Gbp has pulled back from 0.8650+ peaks amidst heavy selling (possibly fix-related to a degree) and a broadly depressed Euro in advance of Thursday’s preliminary Eurozone PMIs and ECB President Draghi’s final policy meeting and presser. Indeed, Eur/Usd has drifted from around 1.1130 towards 1.1100, but not quite enough to rouse option expires at the big figure (1.1 bn).</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/CHF/DXY</strong></p><p>All relatively restrained within tight parameters, as the Loonie straddled 1.1300 amidst conflicting weak Canadian data (wholesale trade) and a supportive rebound in oil (EIA crude stocks declined in contrast to API) and the Yen lost momentum near 108.25 before retreating through 108.50 again. Elsewhere, the Franc meandered either side of 0.9900 as the Dollar index pivoted 97.500, albeit in a firmer band between 97.653-479, and bullishly from a chart perspective, north of the 200 DMA (97.410).</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Ending the midweek EU session on a firmer footing, but tentative around 10.1700 and 10.7300 vs the single currency respectively, as the Norwegian and Swedish Kronas eye tomorrow’s Norges Bank and Riksbank policy guidance and updated rate projections for more direction.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting performances from the Lira and Rand, as Usd/Try retests bids/support at 5.7500 mainly on the back of Turkey’s decision to hold fire in Syria despite the elapse of a 5 day ceasfire, and perhaps acknowledging an improvement in consumer sentiment rather than the consensus for more CBRT easing on Thursday and reports that more Russian S-400 orders may be placed. Conversely, Usd/Zar rebounded to just over 14.7000 at one stage after a knee-jerk dip in wake of softer than expected SA CPI that undermines the SARB’s on hold stance, and as investors remain cautious ahead of the end October budget that will outline aid for Eskom. Elsewhere, Eur/Czk climbed to roughly 25.664 after CNB hawk and dissenter against on hold in September Mora indicated that he may fall in line next time.</p>",

With Sterling off recent highs as Brexit uncertainty lingers, the FTSE 100 (+0.5) has been the marked outperformer, breaking back above the 7200 mark and 50DMA at 7216. Looking ahead, a raft of US large cap earnings, including the likes of Boeing, Caterpillar, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Eli Lilly, will set the tone. So far this earnings season, analysts have described earnings as mostly better than expected, though noting that the bar was very low going in. However, Microsoft earnings tonight, the first of the trillion-dollar companies to report, could quickly shift this narrative. European sectors are mixed, with outperformance in energy (+0.6%), materials (+1.1%) and healthcare (+0.3%). Underperformance in tech is being driven by disappointing earnings last night from Texas Instruments, which has seen the likes of STMicroelectronics (+1.3%) under pressure. In terms of other individual movers; Swedbank (-6.3%) sunk after earnings disappointed and the co. revealed multiple US authorities are investigating the money laundering allegations although this could take years to conclude. Elsewhere, decent earnings from ABB (+3.9), Neste (+6.9%), Norsk Hydro (+5.0%) and Peugeot (+2.5%) saw them move higher, while poor earnings from Fresnillo (-2.9%) and Carrefour (+2.3%) saw their respective shares under pressure.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>Risk sentiment has been sullied somewhat by the latest UK Parliament votes on Brexit that were positive on the one hand, but then countered by subsequent rejection of the motion to push through legislation at breakneck speed for the original and still official Halloween deadline. Hence, another step forward-step back scenario, albeit with more likelihood of an election run effectively along the lines of a 2nd EU referendum, which in turn equates to greater uncertainty. The upshot, so called safe-havens, including Gold, are back in favour, with the DXY consolidating around 97.500 and supported technically after closing above a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (97.410).</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF - </strong>The Yen and Franc are both benefiting from the aforementioned meek or selective risk appetite, with Usd/Jpy back below 108.50 and capped by reported CTA offers overnight, while Usd/Chf is holding just shy of 0.9900 and Eur/Chf straddles 1.1000 within very tight confines. Reports that the BoJ may downgrade growth and inflation forecasts next week are hardly surprising, but add to the general global economic slowdown vibe.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/GBP </strong>- Among the major underperformers on a combination of bearish factors, as the Aussie retreats a bit further vs its US counterpart and remains heavy in cross terms against the Kiwi, with Aud/Usd under 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd unable to regain a foothold above 1.0700 even though Nzd/Usd has lost momentum on the 0.6400 handle. Note, little reaction to NZ trade data, but comments from Australia’s Treasury Secretary Kennedy kicking back against calls for more fiscal stimulus may also be weighing on the Aud. Elsewhere, Sterling is still fixated on Brexit developments for obvious reasons, with Cable retesting recent lows circa 1.2840 and Eur/Gbp back up around 0.8650 awaiting PM Johnson’s next move in response to the EU extension decision (expected as soon as tonight) and any further developments along the line of a snap poll, vote of no confidence in the Government or even a 2nd attempt to get the Programme Motion through the HoC.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/SEK/NOK - </strong>All rather rangy and bereft of independent inspiration/direction, as the Loonie looks toward Canadian wholesale trade following mixed inputs on Tuesday via retail sales, the BoC’s BOS and election results handing victory to Trudeau again, but with less power. Usd/Cad continues to pivot 1.3100, while Eur/Usd sits just above 1.1100 and decent option expiry interest at the strike (1.1 bn) ahead of Thursday’s ECB policy meeting that could well be more validatory rather the revelatory given the extent of the stimulus delivered in September and the fact that President Draghi bids farewell following his eventful term at the helm. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are largely going through the motions awaiting tomorrow’s Riksbank and Norges Bank convenes, though with potentially more to win or lose depending on guidance. Eur/Sek is meandering from 10.7565 to 10.7190 and Eur/Nok flitting either side of 10.2000 against the backdrop of soft crude prices.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the likes of the Lira and Rand after lock-step trade of late, as Usd/Try revisits sub-5.8000 territory on the back of Turkey’s decision to hold fire in Syria despite the elapse of 120 hours inaction arranged with the US, and perhaps acknowledging an improvement in consumer sentiment rather than the consensus for more CBRT easing on Thursday. However, Usd/Zar has rebounded towards 14.6950+ highs after a knee-jerk dip in wake of softer than expected SA CPI that undermines the SARB’s on hold stance, and as investors remain cautious ahead of the end October budget that will outline aid for Eskom.</p><p>Notable FX Expirires, NY Cut:</p><p><strong>- EUR/USD:</strong> 1.1050-70 (1BLN), 1.1100 (1.1BLN), 1.1120-30 (750M), 1.1150 (630M), 1.1185-1.1200 (1.3BLN), 1.1230-35 (600M)</p><p>BoJ are reportedly considering cutting growth and price forecasts in their quarterly outlook on October 31st, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bonds fractionally extended the upside of intraday ranges, with Bunds up to 171.93, Gilts printing 132.48 and the 10 year T-note edging a bit further beyond 130-00 before topping out as EU equities inch higher across the board, not just the inversely-correlated to Sterling and technically charged FTSE. The Dax and Eurozone peers may also have gleaned some traction from gradual Euro depreciation, as Eur/Usd eyes 1.1100, while latest reports on the Brexit front suggest that PM Johnson and Labour leader Corbyn are discussing a new legislative timetable after the fast-track version was rejected last night. Note, the UK benchmark has subsequently reversed to a new 132.12 Liffe low, but its German peers remains firm following a solid German auction that bodes well for tonight’s 5 year US supply, especially after Tuesday’s 2 year note offering was relatively well received, albeit with FOMC easing prospects also enticing investors for the more rate sensitive short maturity.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> prices have been subdued for much of the morning as sentiment remains dampened following yesterday’s Brexit votes and ahead of a number of notable US earnings today. Yesterday’s APIs printed a larger than expected build at 4.45mln vs. Exp. 2.2mln, adding to the pull back in both WTI and Brent yesterday. Currently, Crude prices trade with losses just shy of USD 1/bbl, although they did catch a small bid earlier in the session in-line with equity futures broadly; however, comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak that he has no information regarding discussions on deeper oil cuts at the December OPEC+ meeting halted the mild upside. The comments from Novak are in contrast to the recent source reports noting that OPEC were looking into deeper cuts due to weaker demand outlook. Elsewhere, the Turkey situation has, on the face of it, stabilised somewhat with Turkey noting there is no need to restart the Syria offensive after the ceasefire expires. Although, reports earlier in the session noted that Russian and Turkey are in discussions regarding additional S-400 deliveries, which may prompt a US backlash given their objection to the initial purchases. In terms of metals newsflow, <strong>gold</strong> is firmer on the session and currently trades toward the day’s high although this is still circa. USD 5.0/oz below the USD 1500/oz mark. Elsewhere, <strong>copper prices</strong> are just above the USD 2.60/lb on the day thus far as sentiment keeps prices subdued; in specific newsflow, Antofagasta noted Q3 copper production of 197k tonnes, -14.5% YY.</p><p><strong>API Energy Inventories: Crude +4.51mln (exp. +2.2mln, Prev. +10.45mln)</strong></p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak says he has no information regarding possible discussions on deeper oil production cuts at the OPEC+ December meeting, no official proposals on changing the OPEC+ deal as of yet; though, is always possible to tweak this</strong>, adds that all OPEC+ members must entirely meet their commitments.

The upshot, so called safe-havens, including Gold, are back in favour, with the DXY consolidating around 97.500 and supported technically after closing above a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (97.410).</p><p>JPY/CHF - The Yen and Franc are both benefiting from the aforementioned meek or selective risk appetite, with Usd/Jpy back below 108.50 and capped by reported CTA offers overnight, while Usd/Chf is holding just shy of 0.9900 and Eur/Chf straddles 1.1000 within very tight confines. Reports that the BoJ may downgrade growth and inflation forecasts next week are hardly surprising, but add to the general global economic slowdown vibe.</p><p>AUD/NZD/GBP - Among the major underperformers on a combination of bearish factors, as the Aussie retreats a bit further vs its US counterpart and remains heavy in cross terms against the Kiwi, with Aud/Usd under 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd unable to regain a foothold above 1.0700 even though Nzd/Usd has lost momentum on the 0.6400 handle. Note, little reaction to NZ trade data, but comments from Australia’s Treasury Secretary Kennedy kicking back against calls for more fiscal stimulus may also be weighing on the Aud. Elsewhere, Sterling is still fixated on Brexit developments for obvious reasons, with Cable retesting recent lows circa 1.2840 and Eur/Gbp back up around 0.8650 awaiting PM Johnson’s next move in response to the EU extension decision (expected as soon as tonight) and any further developments along the line of a snap poll, vote of no confidence in the Government or even a 2nd attempt to get the Programme Motion through the HoC.</p><p>CAD/EUR/SEK/NOK - All rather rangy and bereft of independent inspiration/direction, as the Loonie looks toward Canadian wholesale trade following mixed inputs on Tuesday via retail sales, the BoC’s BOS and election results handing victory to Trudeau again, but with less power. Usd/Cad continues to pivot 1.3100, while Eur/Usd sits just above 1.1100 and decent option expiry interest at the strike (1.1 bn) ahead of Thursday’s ECB policy meeting that could well be more validatory rather the revelatory given the extent of the stimulus delivered in September and the fact that President Draghi bids farewell following his eventful term at the helm. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are largely going through the motions awaiting tomorrow’s Riksbank and Norges Bank convenes, though with potentially more to win or lose depending on guidance. Eur/Sek is meandering from 10.7565 to 10.7190 and Eur/Nok flitting either side of 10.2000 against the backdrop of soft crude prices.</p><p>EM - Contrasting fortunes for the likes of the Lira and Rand after lock-step trade of late, as Usd/Try revisits sub-5.8000 territory on the back of Turkey’s decision to hold fire in Syria despite the elapse of 120 hours inaction arranged with the US, and perhaps acknowledging an improvement in consumer sentiment rather than the consensus for more CBRT easing on Thursday. However, Usd/Zar has rebounded towards 14.6950+ highs after a knee-jerk dip in wake of softer than expected SA CPI that undermines the SARB’s on hold stance, and as investors remain cautious ahead of the end October budget that will outline aid for Eskom.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bonds fractionally extended the upside of intraday ranges, with Bunds up to 171.93, Gilts printing 132.48 and the 10 year T-note edging a bit further beyond 130-00 before topping out as EU equities inch higher across the board, not just the inversely-correlated to Sterling and technically charged FTSE. The Dax and Eurozone peers may also have gleaned some traction from gradual Euro depreciation, as Eur/Usd eyes 1.1100, while latest reports on the Brexit front suggest that PM Johnson and Labour leader Corbyn are discussing a new legislative timetable after the fast-track version was rejected last night. Note, the UK benchmark has subsequently reversed to a new 132.12 Liffe low, but its German peers remains firm following a solid German auction that bodes well for tonight’s 5 year US supply, especially after Tuesday’s 2 year note offering was relatively well received, albeit with FOMC easing prospects also enticing investors for the more rate sensitive short maturity.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> prices have been subdued for much of the morning as sentiment remains dampened following yesterday’s Brexit votes and ahead of a number of notable US earnings today. Yesterday’s APIs printed a larger than expected build at 4.45mln vs. Exp. 2.2mln, adding to the pull back in both WTI and Brent yesterday. Currently, Crude prices trade with losses just shy of USD 1/bbl, although they did catch a small bid earlier in the session in-line with equity futures broadly; however, comments from <strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak</strong> that he has no information regarding discussions on deeper oil cuts at the December OPEC+ meeting halted the mild upside. The comments from Novak are in contrast to the recent source reports noting that OPEC were looking into deeper cuts due to weaker demand outlook. Elsewhere, the Turkey situation has, on the face of it, stabilised somewhat with Turkey noting there is no need to restart the Syria offensive after the ceasefire expires. Although, reports earlier in the session noted that Russian and Turkey are in discussions regarding additional S-400 deliveries, which may prompt a US backlash given their objection to the initial purchases. In terms of metals newsflow, <strong>gold</strong> is firmer on the session and currently trades toward the day’s high although this is still circa. USD 5.0/oz below the USD 1500/oz mark. Elsewhere, <strong>copper prices</strong> are just above the USD 2.60/lb on the day thus far as sentiment keeps prices subdued; in specific newsflow, Antofagasta noted Q3 copper production of 197k tonnes, -14.5% YY.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Risk sentiment has been sullied somewhat by the latest UK Parliament votes on Brexit that were positive on the one hand, but then countered by subsequent rejection of the motion to push through legislation at breakneck speed for the original and still official Halloween deadline. Hence, another step forward-step back scenario, albeit with more likelihood of an election run effectively along the lines of a 2nd EU referendum, which in turn equates to greater uncertainty. The upshot, so called safe-havens, including Gold, are back in favour, with the <strong>DXY </strong>consolidating around 97.500 and supported technically after closing above a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (97.410).</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen and Franc are both benefiting from the aforementioned meek or selective risk appetite, with Usd/Jpy back below 108.50 and capped by reported CTA offers overnight, while Usd/Chf is holding just shy of 0.9900 and Eur/Chf straddles 1.1000 within very tight confines. Reports that the BoJ may downgrade growth and inflation forecasts next week are hardly surprising, but add to the general global economic slowdown vibe.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/GBP</strong></p><p>Among the major underperformers on a combination of bearish factors, as the Aussie retreats a bit further vs its US counterpart and remains heavy in cross terms against the Kiwi, with Aud/Usd under 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd unable to regain a foothold above 1.0700 even though Nzd/Usd has lost momentum on the 0.6400 handle. Note, little reaction to NZ trade data, but comments from Australia’s Treasury Secretary Kennedy kicking back against calls for more fiscal stimulus may also be weighing on the Aud. Elsewhere, Sterling is still fixated on Brexit developments for obvious reasons, with Cable retesting recent lows circa 1.2840 and Eur/Gbp back up around 0.8650 awaiting PM Johnson’s next move in response to the EU extension decision (expected as soon as tonight) and any further developments along the line of a snap poll, vote of no confidence in the Government or even a 2nd attempt to get the Programme Motion through the HoC.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>All rather rangy and bereft of independent inspiration/direction, as the Loonie looks toward Canadian wholesale trade following mixed inputs on Tuesday via retail sales, the BoC’s BOS and election results handing victory to Trudeau again, but with less power. Usd/Cad continues to pivot 1.3100, while Eur/Usd sits just above 1.1100 and decent option expiry interest at the strike (1.1 bn) ahead of Thursday’s ECB policy meeting that could well be more validatory rather the revelatory given the extent of the stimulus delivered in September and the fact that President Draghi bids farewell following his eventful term at the helm. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are largely going through the motions awaiting tomorrow’s Riksbank and Norges Bank convenes, though with potentially more to win or lose depending on guidance. Eur/Sek is meandering from 10.7565 to 10.7190 and Eur/Nok flitting either side of 10.2000 against the backdrop of soft crude prices.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the likes of the Lira and Rand after lock-step trade of late, as Usd/Try revisits sub-5.8000 territory on the back of Turkey’s decision to hold fire in Syria despite the elapse of 120 hours inaction arranged with the US, and perhaps acknowledging an improvement in consumer sentiment rather than the consensus for more CBRT easing on Thursday. However, Usd/Zar has rebounded towards 14.6950+ highs after a knee-jerk dip in wake of softer than expected SA CPI that undermines the SARB’s on hold stance, and as investors remain cautious ahead of the end October budget that will outline aid for Eskom.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* THE LATEST: </strong>Last night, the UK Government won the vote on the second reading of the WAB by 329 to 299 votes but lost the vote for its programme motion (which would have seen the WAB implemented into law within 3 days) by 308-322. Following the defeat on its programme motion, UK PM Johnson announced a pause to the legislative passage of the WAB, and called on the EU to decide how to proceed (by choosing the length of the delay). However, reports alleged that UK PM Johnson and Opposition Leader Corbyn are reportedly meeting to discuss a new programme motion.</p><p><strong>* EXTENSION LENGTH: </strong>Reportedly, the<strong> </strong>EU is to respond to the UK's Brexit extension request as soon as tonight, although the French have been pushing to wait until the end of the week. The EU looks set to grant the UK an extension, however, the length is still uncertain. Reports alleged that multiple Brussels diplomats were hinting that EU will follow the Benn Act and give a likely flexible extension until 31 January. However, separate reports alleged that France is to examine at the end of the week whether a purely technical delay of a few days is necessary and is said to rule out any further extension past this technical delay. Some desks have argued that granting the extension that the UK actually asked for (31 January as mandated in the Benn act) is preferable for the EU, as giving a shorter, technical extension may be seen as interfering in UK politics (in that it favours the passage of UK PM Johnson’s deal). Meanwhile, in recent weeks, reports out of German have hinted that Chancellor Merkel favours a much longer 6-month extension. Either way, the decision is likely to be made at an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders in the coming days/weeks. As per the Benn Act, Johnson must accept whatever extension length the EU offer.</p><p><strong>* ELECTION OR LEGISLATION? </strong>The UK Government has warned that if the EU grants an extension until 31 January, then it will push for a general election before Christmas. Parliament will have to approve an early election; the conventional way for the government to do this is to get 2/3s of MPs to agree to an election under the fixed term parliament act. Otherwise, the government could call a VONC in itself or try to pass a simple one-line bill (saying there will be an election), with these options only requiring a simple majority. Heading into an election, with parliament having voted down the government’s programme motion (which could have delivered Brexit by 31 October), the Conservatives can argue that Parliament is blocking/delaying Brexit, in fitting with the “parliament vs the people” narrative the party has been pushing. All the while, PM Johnson can say that he fulfilled his Brexit pledge by reaching a deal with the EU. Desks and political strategists have argued that this puts the Conservatives in a position of strength, strength which is reflected the most recent YouGov/Times poll, which have the Conservatives as high as 37% vs Labour’s 22%. Despite Labour’s insistence that it wants an election once no deal is “off the table” (presumably, an extension to 31 January would fulfil this criteria), Labour MPs may be reluctant to head to the polls so soon, and may prefer to postpone an election in the hope that Conservative momentum wanes. Alternatively, with Parliament having given its approval to a Brexit deal for the first time, the government may opt to resume legislative work on the WAB – a possibility made more likely if the EU grants only a short, technical extension of a few weeks. Some noted that the government is implicitly open to this possibility given that it only paused the legislative process rather than pulling the WAB in its entirety – for this government, a short delay may be worth it if it means it can say it has delivered Brexit by the time the UK heads back to the polls. On this outcome, Danske Bank conclude that, if PM Johnson resumes the legislative work, it could be either successful and the UK would then soon leave the EU or it could fail (perhaps because of 'soft Brexit' amendments like a permanent UK-wide customs union with the EU, or amendments prolonging the transition period), which also lead to a general election.</p><p><strong>* WHICH IS MORE LIKELY? </strong>Conventional wisdom suggests the best election strategy would be for the UK to have left the EU before voters head to the polls, suggests ING, an argument which favours the government reluctantly accepting the delay and pressing ahead with the WAB legislation. However, the bank caveats, much of the Conservatives election campaign strategy relies upon Brexit being “front-and-centre in the electorate’s mind” when they vote. Counterintuitively then, says the bank, “if a Brexit deal is ratified, but an election takes place with a lag (say in February or March next year), that might just give the opposition the space to reframe the debate away from Brexit, back to the domestic agenda (particularly economic issues) where the Conservatives are arguably more vulnerable.” So, adds ING, the benefit of an election before Brexit is delivered is that it is hard for an election to be about anything other than Brexit.</p><p><strong>* NO PATH TO NO DEAL? </strong>The EU could refuse offer the UK an extension, which would leave the UK with very little time to implement the WAB, meaning a no deal exit would be likely – however, the debate within the EU appears to be the length of any extension rather than whether or not to grant one, rendering this outcome highly unlikely. Another possible route to no deal could be if the EU were to grant a short, technical extension, but the UK failed to implement the WAB into law on time – again this outcome seems unlikely; a key concern that led some opposition MPs to vote for the government’s WAB but against its programme motion was the lack of time for proper scrutiny over the legislation and so a short delay to Brexit could give these MPs the time they need to support a less condensed programme motion. Moreover, a short delay would ramp up pressure on MPs who oppose a no deal to back the deal that is on the table. In the case of a pre-Christmas election; if PM Johnsons wins, he can implement his Brexit deal without too many problems, meanwhile, if the opposition win, they would most likely call a second EU referendum. However, there is also the possibility that Parliament could remain in a deadlock after an election. Regardless, conclude Danske Bank, “it is difficult to see a path to a no-deal outcome anymore, which also explains why a lot of negativity has been priced out of the GBP.”</p>",

(-0.3%)</strong> conformed to the overall downbeat tone with the former mired by political uncertainty as Beijing was said to draw up plans to replace Hong Kong Chief Executive Lam, although mainland losses were cushioned by another substantial PBoC liquidity effort. Finally, 10yr JGBs opened back above the 154.00 level as it tracked gains in T-notes and amid the predominantly risk-averse tone, but with upside limited as Japanese stocks just about stayed afloat and with the BoJ only in the market for Treasury Discount Bills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 200bln via 7-day reverse repos for a daily net injection of CNY 200bln.

(Newswires) <strong>France is to examine at the end of the week whether a purely technical delay of a few days is necessary and is said to rule out any further extension past this technical delay</strong>, according to a diplomatic source.

Elsewhere, the lacklustre risk tone facilitated mild flows into the safe-haven <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>antipodeans</strong> suffered due to their high-beta properties coupled with a weaker CNY reference rate setting, while TRY was marginally supported after Turkey suggested there was no need to restart the Syria offensive following the expiration of the 120-hour deadline.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures retraced some of the advances seen in the prior day where prices had been underpinned by reports OPEC and allies are to consider deeper oil cuts when they meet in early December, with the overnight pullback as the result of the dampened risk appetite and a larger than expected build in the latest API crude inventories.

(Newswires/AFP/NTV)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>At settlement, yields were lower, and the curve had bull-flattened slightly. The Treasury complex was quiet, with little by way of major moves. Indeed, some desks were noting that the volume in the T-Note future over the last three days was the lowest it has been since middle of November 2014, and even lower than some holiday periods. The Treasury auction of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through by 1bps on solid cover, which was above recent averages; Indirect participation, which can often be a gauge for foreign demand, was 54.8%, higher than the 6-auction average of 48.4%. Directs took 14%, less than the 6-auction average of 21.4%, leaving dealers with 31.2%, above than the average of 30.2%. Tomorrow, the Treasury will auction a 5-year note; the previous 5-year auction was soft, tailing by 0.9bps, and cover coming in below recent averages. But analysts at SocGen suggest that the 5-year sector has slight set-up ahead of Wednesday's auction from a relative value perspective, noting that the current 5-year trades cheap in asset swap compared to older 5s, and also trades cheap on the curve compared to 2s and 10s. SocGen believes that the auction will still need some concession, since the current WI yield is low when compared to previous stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness on an outright basis versus the previous auction cycles. SocGen also says that relatively low dealer holdings in the 3-6-year bucket should marginally support demand. The bank says it is neutral on the auction. US T-note (Z9) settled 6 ticks higher at 129-26.</p><p>US President Trump Special Assistant for International Trade, Investment and Development Kelly Ann Shaw is to leave the White House on Friday.

Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) struggled to maintain the holiday cheer on return from yesterday’s closure amid flows into the JPY with underperformance in SoftBank amid its bailout of WeWork including USD 5bln of new financing, although Eisai shares were indicated to surge over 18% and hit limit up with a glut of buy orders after aducanumab partner Biogen revived hope in its Alzheimer’s treatment and is to seek FDA approval next year. Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) conformed to the overall downbeat tone with the former mired by political uncertainty as Beijing was said to draw up plans to replace Hong Kong Chief Executive Lam, although mainland losses were cushioned by another substantial PBoC liquidity effort. Finally, 10yr JGBs opened back above the 154.00 level as it tracked gains in T-notes and amid the predominantly risk-averse tone, but with upside limited as Japanese stocks just about stayed afloat and with the BoJ only in the market for Treasury Discount Bills.</p>",

Elsewhere, the lacklustre risk tone facilitates mild flows into the safe-haven JPY and antipodeans suffer due to their high-beta properties coupled with a weaker CNY reference rate setting, while TRY was mildly supported after Turkey suggested there was no need to restart the Syria offensive after the 120-hour deadline expired.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs opened back above the 154.00 level as it tracked gains in T-notes and amid the predominantly risk-averse tone, but with upside limited as Japanese stocks strive to stay afloat and with the BoJ only in the market for Treasury Discount Bills.</p>",
