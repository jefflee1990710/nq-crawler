The S&amp;P 500 Emini topped it’s 200dma and vaulted 3,000 for the first time since March, with gains being led by Financials as yields rise, and Cyclicals as economies reopen; Health Care and Telecoms – two key beneficiaries of ‘work from home’ – were at the bottom of the performance table; small caps and value baskets also enjoyed a decent session with R2K outperforming. However, as the sanctions report hit the Emini broke back beneath 3000. COVID sensitive names, Airlines (UAL, AAL, DAL, LUV) and Cruise Lines (CCL, NCLH, RCL) are performing well on economic reopening hopes. However, gains in airlines are likely being capped after the US government accused China of blocking US carriers from resuming flights to China, potentially tying in the industry to the souring relations between China and the US. Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) earnings beat on top and bottom line, SSS -1%, but better than the expected -5% print. AZO also noted that over the last four weeks of the quarter SSS turned meaningfully positive as the stimulus checks arrived to consumers. Macy’s (M) announced it has begun to reopen stores gradually on a limited basis; notes in the stores that have already opened demand is higher than expected, reiterating sales are currently at 50% of 2019 levels. SPX +1.2% at 2992, NDX -0.3% at 9390, DJIA +2.2% at 24,995.</p><p>The TPLEX sold off on Tuesday after the long weekend, as equity futures rebounded to the upside. By settlement, the curve had bear steepened with yields lower by between 1-6bps across the curve. The sell-off began at the CME open and then accelerated as Spooz broke above its 200dma and above 3000 for the first time since early-March; real money was also reported to be a heavy seller. Further, the souring US-China relations were overshadowed somewhat by new entrants into the COVID vaccine development. Meanwhile, a slew of IG deals came to the dollar market, likely amplifying the pressure on duration. Towards the front-end, the US sold its new, upsized 2-year note, USD 44bln worth, tailing the 0.176% WI by 0.2bp, covered 2.68x (vs average 2.59x), and dealers taking 32.1% (in line with average). T-note (M0) futures settled 6+ ticks lower at 138-30+.</p>",

The S&amp;P 500 Emini topped it’s 200dma and vaulted 3,000 for the first time since March, with gains being led by Financials as yields rise, and Cyclicals as economies reopen; Health Care and Telecoms – two key beneficiaries of ‘work from home’ – were at the bottom of the performance table; small caps and value baskets also enjoyed a decent session with R2K outperforming. However, as the sanctions report hit the Emini broke back beneath 3000. The Treasury curve bear-steepened; the US sold new 2-year notes at a record low yield, though the sale tailed 0.2bps (the previous saw a chunky stop-through), while cover was firmer than average; the breakdown showed dealers taking down more than the prior auction, and directs and indirects taking slightly less. The US will sell 5s on Wednesday, and 7s on Thursday (see preview). The dollar got hit, despite the PBOC fixing its USDCNY reference rate to the highest since February 2008; the dollar got another hit on ECB sources reports, suggesting the central bank was contingency planning amid the legal case with the German constitutional court. Crude followed risk. There was a slight wobble after the European players had left for the day, amid reports from Merck’s CEO that a 12-18 month timeframe to develop a COVID vaccine was “very aggressive”, and at the same time, another dose of confrontational rhetoric from the US (Mr Kudlow). But risk proved resilient, and stocks re-entered their ranges. In afternoon trade, there were some positive remarks from JPM CEO on loan loss provisions (sees another build in Q2, but not in Q3 and Q4) – some desks had seen banks’ building of reserves as a negative for stocks in the medium-term, although Dimon’s comments seem to lean into that (would be encouraging to hear from other CEOs).</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>On the Phase One trade deal, NEC Director Kudlow noted that the deal is intact for the moment. He stated that US President Trump is so “miffed” with China that a trade deal is not as important as it once was. Kudlow added that the US will do what they can to help US companies move back from China and/or Hong Kong. On China companies he reiterated that China must comply with auditing standards; note the bill passed in the senate calls for this and for the companies listed on US exchanges to prove they are not owned by the Chinese government.</p><p><strong>HONG KONG:</strong> In late trade, source reports suggested the US is considering sanctions on Chinese officials and firms over Hong Kong, although discussions are said to still be ongoing. The report added the Treasury Department could impose controls transactions and freeze assets of Chinese officials and businesses for implementing the new national security law. Note, Over the weekend US National Security Adviser O’Brien stated that the US government will likely impose economic sanctions on Hong Kong and China if China moves forward with national security law for Hong Kong. At the same time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said China would take necessary countermeasures if US insists on undermining China's interests regarding Hong-Kong related sanctions. The White House announced that US President Trump is displeased with China's efforts, adding that it is hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub if China takes over. Meanwhile, NEC Director Kudlow said to Fox News that what China is doing in Hong Kong is very disturbing and it is making a big mistake with its Hong Kong moves.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>ECB </strong>sources reported the bank is working on a contingency plan to carry out the PSPP bond purchases even without the Bundesbank, where it would continue buying German bonds even if the Bundesbank were forced to quit, either via the ECB itself, or through other EZ state banks. Furthermore, the sources noted the ECB would likely launch an infringement procedure against the Bundesbank for failing to fulfil its obligation as a member of the Eurosystem if it decided to stop purchasing under the PSPP. Note, the report said that no plans are finalised, and this is a scenario in the extreme case. For context, the report follows the German Constitutional Court ruling that demands the ECB to provide clarity with regards to the proportionality of its bond purchases. Analysts have largely expected that the Court's ruling is unlikely to derail the ECB's asset purchases, although it does provide some hurdles.</p><p><strong>RECOVERY FUND PREVIEW:</strong> European Commission President Von der Leyen will unveil the Commission’s Recovery Fund (RF) proposal on Wednesday (timing TBC), which will require unanimous backing to pass. This will be in addition to the already announced EUR 540bln package (including ESM, EIB, and the “SURE” instrument). Though the RF will provide EU countries some relief, consensus will also aid political relations among EU members, namely the North and South. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24622/download\">Please click here to download the full preview.</a></p><h2><strong>UK</strong></h2><p><strong>BOE:</strong> BoE's Chief Economist Haldane on NIRP, stated the BoE is not remotely close to any decision on taking rates into negative territory, adding a key issue with negative rates are regarding the financial sector and confidence in the economy. stated the UK economy likely contracted by over 20% in Q2, noting recent data \"just a shade\" better than BoE's scenario. On the recovery, he stated this is perhaps still a V-shaped recovery, but a lopsided V and risks are of protracted recovery.</p><p><strong>BREXIT:</strong> According to sources, the EU is preparing to drop its \"maximalist\" approach to negotiations on fisheries with Britain in the next round of negotiations, and the EU hopes that discussions with the UK next week could reduce differences on negotiations and enable momentum for broader talks on trade. However, after the source reports, EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier stuck to his guns, noting EU ministers “confirmed that there will be no FTA without a level playing field &amp; a balanced, sustainable, long-term solution on fisheries”.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-30+.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX sold off on Tuesday after the long weekend, as equity futures rebounded to the upside. By settlement, the curve had bear steepened with yields lower by between 1-6bps across the curve. The sell-off began at the CME open and then accelerated as Spooz broke above its 200dma and above 3000 for the first time since early-March; real money was also reported to be a heavy seller. Further, the souring US-China relations were overshadowed somewhat by new entrants into the COVID vaccine development. Meanwhile, a slew of IG deals came to the dollar market, likely amplifying the pressure on duration. Towards the front-end, the US sold its new, upsized 2-year note, USD 44bln worth, tailing the 0.176% WI by 0.2bp, covered 2.68x (vs average 2.59x), and dealers taking 32.1% (in line with average).</p><p><strong>FED PURCHASES: </strong>This week, the Fed has tapered its asset purchases to USD 20bln (averaging around USD 5bln per day); In percentage terms, all tenors were cut around one-third, but in dollar terms, the impact is seen on the short end, with the zero to 2.25-year sector has seen purchases reduced by USD 3bln, and the 2.25-4.5-year sector has seen purchases reduced by USD 4bln.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY: </strong>US will sell a new 5-year (USD 45bln, Wednesday) and a new 7-year (USD 38bln, Thursday) this week, for a total of USD 127bln; analysts note that 101bln of cash flows fall due this week, (around USD 92bln redemptions, and around 9bln in coupons), implying net supply of USD 26bln. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-new-2-year-usd-44bln-tue-new-5-year-usd-45bln-wed-and-a-new-7-year-usd-38bln-thu-this-week-25-05-2020\">See auction previews here.</a></p><p><strong>5-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.394%, six-auction average 1.145%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.74x, six-auction avg. 2.51x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 19.4%, six-auction avg. 25.4%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 20.2%, six-auction avg. 14.4%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 60.4%, six-auction avg. 60.2%)</li></ul><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p>WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 1.10 HIGHER AT USD 34.35/BBL; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 0.64 HIGHER AT USD 36.17/BBL</p><p>A choppy session for the energy complex as it took its cues from wider risk appetite, with WTI coming off its intraday high of 34.80. The benchmarks had found their footing overnight and into the US session as major equity bourses breached higher – ES traded above 3000 for the first time since early-March. However, after the US cash equity open, where gains were faded somewhat, the crude benchmarks also came under pressure. On the supply front, Russian Energy Minister Novak reportedly met with Russian oil majors today to discuss an extension of current cuts past the end of June – the checkpoint for OPEC to reduce output curbs. Furthermore, Russia’s Kremlin said today that the OPEC+ deal is definitely effective and it is helping to avoid a bad scenario for oil markets; when asked if additional efforts would be needed, said that the OPEC+ deal participants would look at how the situation develops. It was also reported that the Russian government has tentatively approved plans to drill oil wells to stand ready to pump in 2022 when the OPEC+ deal expires. Looking ahead in the near term, participants will be focusing on the latest US energy inventory data, with bulls looking for further confirmation of drawdowns; current expectations (bbls): crude -2.5mln, gasoline unchanged, distillates +1.3mln. The private inventory report will be released a day later on Wednesday evening ahead of the official EIA release on Thursday.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.2% at 2992, NDX -0.3% at 9390, DJIA +2.2% at 24,995</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Financials +5%, Industrials +4.2%, Real Estate +3.2%, Energy +2.9%, Materials +2.7%, Discretionary +1.1%, Utilities +0.7%, Staples +0.5%, Communications 0.2%, Technology -0.1%, Health Care -0.2%.</p><p><strong>EUROPE CLOSES:</strong> Euro Stoxx 50 +0.95% at 3000, FTSE 100 +1.19% at 6065, DAX +0.96% at 11501, CAC 40 +1.46% at 4606, IBEX 35 +2.21% at 7008, FTSE MIB +1.45% at 17852, SMI (unch.) at 9825.</p><p><strong>ES LEVELS: </strong>3397.50 (Feb'20 ATH); 3337.50 (Jan'20 ytd hi); 3181 (Jan'20 ytd lo); 3135 (78.6% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo); 3100 (psych); 3019.75 (May'20 hi today); 2998 (200dma); 2982-84 (Mon VAP - thin); 2963-66 (Mon VAP - thin); 2957 (FY21 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied); 2958 (5dma); 2955 (FY20 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied); 2948-50 (VAP); 2940-42 (VAP); 2930 (61.8% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo).</p><p><strong>VACCINE CANDIDATES: </strong>Novavax (NVAX) has begun a clinical Phase 1 trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, with the first trial participants enrolled as well; preliminary results are expected to be released in July. Merck (MRK) has joined the vaccine race and has acquired Thermis and plans to start clinical studies on the vaccine within weeks, it is also working with IAVI with clinical studies planned to start later this year. MRK notes its antiviral candidate with RidgeBack Bio is already underway. Elsewhere, the WHO has temporarily paused tests on hydroxychloroquine (TEVA, MYL) due to safety concerns. Meanwhile, the NIH highlighted that Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir works best on patients who need extra oxygen but do not require medical ventilation. The updates of further vaccines weighed on Moderna (MRNA).</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> COVID sensitive names, Airlines (UAL, AAL, DAL, LUV) and Cruise Lines (CCL, NCLH, RCL) are performing well on economic reopening hopes. However, gains in airlines are likely being capped after the US government accused China of blocking US carriers from resuming flights to China, potentially tying in the industry to the souring relations between China and the US. Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) earnings beat on top and bottom line, SSS -1%, but better than the expected -5% print. AZO also noted that over the last four weeks of the quarter SSS turned meaningfully positive as the stimulus checks arrived to consumers. Macy’s (M) announced it has begun to reopen stores gradually on a limited basis; notes in the stores that have already opened demand is higher than expected, reiterating sales are currently at 50% of 2019 levels. The retailer expects COVID-19 to impact Q2 more greatly than Q1. As of May 22nd, it had roughly USD 270 stores open. Macy’s (M) also announced a USD 1.1bln 5-year note private offering and is to use the proceeds to repay outstanding credit facilities.Eli Lilly (LLY) Phase 3 CONQUER study of its migraine drug, Emgality, found it improved work productivity and health and well-being between migraine attacks. Macy’s (M) announced it has begun to reopen stores gradually on a limited basis; notes in the stores that have already opened demand is higher than expected, reiterating sales are currently at 50% of 2019 levels. M expects Q2 to see a greater impact than Q1. Six Flags (SIX) announced it plans to reopen some of its parks from early June at limited capacity.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Headline consumer confidence ticked up from a previously revised 85.7 (prev. 86.9) to 86.6, although missed analyst expectations for a rise to 87.0. The rebound was not as strong as some had been hoping for; the present situation index fell to 71.1 from 73, while the expectations index rose to 96.9 from 94.3. The differential between jobs plentiful and hard to get declined to 10.4 from 15.7. Meanwhile the inflation expectations saw a rise to 6.2% from 5.4% last month, in similar fitting with the UoM inflation expectations which rose to 3% from 2.1%. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlights “the big picture here is that the net drop in confidence in recent months has been only about three-fifth the size of the collapse before/during/after the crash of 2008, even though the hit to the labor market has been much bigger”. This suggests that people believe the pandemic will pass relatively quickly and the stimulus checks and employment benefits have helped shield consumers from the financial consequences for now. On the inflation expectations, PM believes this jump will only last for a few months and is currently driven by the rise in food prices.</p><p><strong>US NEW HOME SALES (APR): </strong>New Home sales rose 0.6% M/M after the prior months' 15.4% fall, although only a slight rise it significantly beat the expected print of -21.9%. The changes sees units at 0.623mln, up from 0.619mln. Wells Fargo highlights that home builders reported traffic was brisk throughout the majority of the month, and applications for new purchases rose steadily in recent weeks. It also highlights that the fall in the median price of a new home is -8.6% Y/Y to USD 309,900 due to rising sales of cheaper homes and less sales in the more expensive western markets.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD</strong>: The greenback saw downside today amid a positive risk backdrop on further vaccine and reopening hopes. The dollar initially breached 99.00 to the downside, although as equities came off highs the dollar regained some ground and now resides just above the 99 handle. As month-end approaches, Citi’s model estimates FX flows to favour USD selling, noting it is driven by global equity investors rebalancing needs as the US market has likely left them under hedged.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong>: The yen benefitted from the falling buck with USDJPY lower on the day trading within a ~50 pip range from 107.41-107.92. Technicians at Credit Suisse highlight the cross help support at 107.42, its uptrend from March as well as its 13-day exponential average. The desk believes “leaves the immediate risk higher for a retest of key resistance from the mid-April highs and May highs and 38.2% retracement of the March/May fall and at 108.17”. Price action ignored overnight comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who noted the bank is ready to ease through steps such as expanding the loan scheme, rate cuts, and increased ETF buying or other new measures. He also noted risks remain skewed to the downside.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, NZD, CAD): </strong>Risk sensitive currencies saw stellar performance today and were the outperformers given the improved risk appetite on vaccine hopes.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong>: Sterling also benefiting from source reports that the EU is reportedly preparing to drop its maximalist approach to negotiations on fisheries with the UK in the next round of negotiations. Negotiations around fisheries have been a sticking point in talks between the two, the report added the EU hopes discussions with the UK next week could reduce differences and enable momentum for broader trade talks, meanwhile the end-June extension request deadline is approaching; ING believe EURGBP will struggle to break below 0.89 before an agreement is made. Elsewhere, the UK government announced plans to re-open the retail sector in the middle of June, likely also supporting the Pound.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong>: With the Aussie initially rallying past 0.6650 with improved sentiment, technicians are eyeing the 200dma at 0.6659 and the 76.4% fib level of 0.6673 with resistance at the March high of 0.6685. ING highlights the recent strength despite the overhang of Aussie/China relations has been supported by a favourable commodity backdrop, but as the Chinese government looks to be mulling duties on its main exports, “AUD is likely to bear the biggest deal of short-term downside risk in G10 at the moment”. Elsewhere, the ANZ Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence data ticked up slightly this week to 92.7 from 92.3. NZD was the G10 outperfomer due to the solid risk environment while it also saw a wider surplus in April than March, although it was driven by less imports as exports also fell but not to the same extent, likely as many of its trading partners were facing lockdown restrictions over the period.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong>: The Loonie also saw solid gains against the falling dollar, finding support from a firmer crude complex too. The gains are not as strong as seen in the AUD and NZD despite the crude tailwind. Analysts at Scotiabank expect the CAD to show modest appreciation and look for USDCAD to test the low/mid 1.38s at least, while its technical analysts suggest a weekly close below 1.3850 would signal a more durable technical breakdown at this point.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX saw decent gains today amid the improved risk environment while RUB and MXN both caught a tailwind from the firmer crude complex. TRY &amp; RUB also partaking in the risk rally.</p><p><strong>BRL:</strong> The Real saw solid gains; HSBC highlights Brazilian markets ignored the release of a controversial cabinet meeting, which some had expected would have larger ramifications, could be a factor in BRL strength. The desk still sees significant downside risks for Brazilian assets as the coronavirus and political woes deepen; “the BRL can see short-term gains on positive external sentiment, but we expect underperformance and further weakness vs the USD over the medium term.”</p>",

The benchmarks had found their footing overnight and into the US session as major equity bourses breached higher – ES traded above 3000 for the first time since early-March. However, after the US cash equity open, where gains were faded somewhat, the crude benchmarks also came under pressure. On the supply front, Russian Energy Minister Novak reportedly met with Russian oil majors today to discuss an extension of current cuts past the end of June – the checkpoint for OPEC to reduce output curbs. Furthermore, Russia’s Kremlin said today that the OPEC+ deal is definitely effective and it is helping to avoid a bad scenario for oil markets; when asked if additional efforts would be needed, said that the OPEC+ deal participants would look at how the situation develops. It was also reported that the Russian government has tentatively approved plans to drill oil wells to stand ready to pump in 2022 when the OPEC+ deal expires. Looking ahead in the near term, participants will be focusing on the latest US energy inventory data, with bulls looking for further confirmation of drawdowns; current expectations (bbls): crude -2.5mln, gasoline unchanged, distillates +1.3mln. The private inventory report will be released a day later on Wednesday evening ahead of the official EIA release on Thursday.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD:</strong> The greenback saw downside today amid a positive risk backdrop on further vaccine and reopening hopes. The dollar initially breached 99.00 to the downside, although as equities came off highs the dollar regained some ground and now resides just above the 99 handle. As month end approaches, Citi’s model estimates FX flows to favour USD selling, noting it is driven by global equity investors rebalancing needs as the US market has likely left them under hedged.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The yen benefitted from the falling buck with USDJPY lower on the day trading within a ~50 pip range from 107.41-107.92. Technicians at Credit Suisse highlight the cross help support at 107.42, its uptrend from March as well as its 13-day exponential average. The desk believes “leaves the immediate risk higher for a retest of key resistance from the mid-April highs and May highs and 38.2% retracement of the March/May fall and at 108.17”. Price action ignored overnight comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who noted the bank is ready to ease through steps such as expanding the loan scheme, rate cuts and increased ETF buying or other new measures. He also noted risks remain skewed to the downside.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, NZD, CAD):</strong> Risk sensitive currencies saw stellar performance today and were the outperformers given the improved risk appetite on vaccine hopes.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Sterling also benefiting from source reports that the EU are reportedly preparing to drop its maximalist approach to negotiations on fisheries with the UK in the next round of negotiations. Negotiations around fisheries have been a sticking point in talks between the two, the report added the EU hopes discussions with the UK next week could reduce differences and enable momentum for broader trade talks, meanwhile the end-June extension request deadline is approaching; ING believe EURGBP will struggle to break below 0.89 before an agreement is made. Elsewhere, the UK government announced plans to re-open the retail sector in the middle of June, likely also supporting the Pound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD: </strong>With the Aussie initially rallying past 0.6650 with improved sentiment, technicians are eyeing the 200dma at 0.6659 and the 76.4% fib level of 0.6673 with resistance at the March high of 0.6685. ING highlights the recent strength despite the overhang of Aussie/China relations has been supported by a favourable commodity backdrop, but as the Chinese government looks to be mulling duties on its main exports, “AUD is likely to bear the biggest deal of short-term downside risk in G10 at the moment”. Elsewhere, the ANZ Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence data ticked up slightly this week to 92.7 from 92.3. NZD was the G10 outperfomer due to the solid risk environment while it also saw a wider surplus in April than March, although it was driven by less imports as exports also fell but not to the same extent, likely as many of its trading partners were facing lockdown restrictions over the period.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie also saw solid gains against the falling dollar, finding support from a firmer crude complex too. The gains are not as strong as seen in the AUD and NZD despite the crude tailwind. Analysts at Scotiabank expect the CAD to show modest appreciation and look for USDCAD to test the low/mid 1.38s at least, while its technical analysts suggest a weekly close below 1.3850 would signal a more durable technical breakdown at this point.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>EMFX saw decent gains today amid the improved risk environment while RUB and MXN both caught a tailwind from the firmer crude complex. TRY &amp; RUB also partaking in the risk rally.</p><p><strong>BRL:</strong> The Real saw solid gains; HSBC highlights Brazilian markets ignored the release of a controversial cabinet meeting, which some had expected would have larger ramifications, could be a factor in BRL strength. The desk still sees significant downside risks for Brazilian assets as the coronavirus and political woes deepen; “the BRL can see short-term gains on positive external sentiment, but we expect underperformance and further weakness vs the USD over the medium term.”</p>",

The rebound was not as strong as some had been hoping for; the present situation index fell to 71.1 from 73, while the expectations index rose to 96.9 from 94.3. The differential between jobs plentiful and hard to get declined to 10.4 from 15.7. Meanwhile the inflation expectations saw a rise to 6.2% from 5.4% last month, in similar fitting with the UoM inflation expectations which rose to 3% from 2.1%. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlights “the big picture here is that the net drop in confidence in recent months has been only about three-fifth the size of the collapse before/during/after the crash of 2008, even though the hit to the labor market has been much bigger”. This suggests that people believe the pandemic will pass relatively quickly and the stimulus checks and employment benefits have helped shield consumers from the financial consequences for now. On the inflation expectations, PM believes this jump will only last for a few months and is currently driven by the rise in food prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY: </strong>US will sell a new 2-year (USD 44bln, Tuesday), a new 5-year (USD 45bln, Wednesday) and a new 7-year (USD 38bln, Thursday) this week, for a total of USD 127bln; analysts note that 101bln of cash flows fall due this week, (around USD 92bln redemptions, and around 9bln in coupons), implying net supply of USD 26bln.</p><p><strong>FED PURCHASES:</strong> This week, the Fed has tapered its asset purchases to USD 20bln (averaging around USD 5bln per day); In percentage terms, all tenors were cut around one-third, but in dollar terms, the impact is seen on the short end, with the zero to 2.25-year sector has seen purchases reduced by USD 3bln, and the 2.25-4.5-year sector has seen purchases reduced by USD 4bln. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/ny-fed-cuts-treasuries-tips-purchases-to-usd-20bln-prev-30bln-usd-5bln-per-day-for-next-week-prev-usd-6bln-schedule-for-monday-may-26-29-2020-all-times-et-22-05-2020\">Details here</a>.</p><p><strong>FRONT-END/NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>The front-end of the curve remains floored, despite the heavy USD 2trln of bills supply. Fed officials have continued to push-back against negative rates, yet markets continue to assign a non-zero possibility they will be seen by the middle of next year. This pricing might exists for two reasons: the first is practical, and will be related to hedging scenarios by some players, given rates are at historic lows; the other is due to the unknowns about how COVID will play out, and if re-openings result in a lock down more severe than the first; the Fed has already brought rates down to historic lows, and has already boosted liquidity and added programmes to help stabilise markets, the question is what further significant measures they can do. The onus seems to be on fiscal policymakers, and at present, there seems to be a reduced political will for further stimulus.</p><p><strong>YCC AHEAD:</strong> Last week’s Fed minutes offered some insight on yield curve control, with ‘several’ policymakers seeing merit in the tool. BMO does not see this is a near-term transition for the Fed, but it may be a tool for the Fed if the recovery stumbles or takes longer than market participants are anticipating. In practice, the bank says that YCC would be the Fed augmenting its forward guidance rather than anything revolutionary, emphasising that rates will remain low; so if yields, say up to 5-year maturities, rise beyond a certain point (say, 0.25%), the Fed will buy and bring them back down. In terms of the current environment, with 5-year yields already at around 35bps, an announcement of YCC would help to engineer a small rally in the belly, but much has already been priced in, BMO thinks. One advantage of the policy is that if the Fed were to communicate YCC well, it might not even need to buy anything extra, since the market will know there is a price-insensitive amount of demand above whatever the yield cap is, and will immediately price to the cap or below. As long as the Fed has a credible commitment of demand at that point, the market will incorporate lower rates for longer, which is what the FOMC wants.</p><p><strong>2-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.229%, six-auction average 1.085%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -1.2bps, six-auction avg. 0.2bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 3.11x, six-auction avg. 2.59x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 26.4%, six-auction avg. 32.1%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 17.8%, six-auction avg. 17.8%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 55.8%, six-auction avg. 50.1%)</li></ul><p><strong>5-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.394%, six-auction average 1.145%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.74x, six-auction avg. 2.51x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 19.4%, six-auction avg. 25.4%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 20.2%, six-auction avg. 14.4%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 60.4%, six-auction avg. 60.2%)</li></ul><p><strong>7-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.525%, six-auction average 1.263%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.1bps, six-auction avg. -0.3bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.56x, six-auction avg. 2.52x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 21.3%, six-auction avg. 22.7%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 12.3%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.1%)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The marked underperformer among G10 FX amid month-end models pointing to Dollars selling coupled with risk appetite inducing USD outflows. The index held onto losses seen early EU-doors and looks to end the session just above its 21 DMA at the 99.000 psychological level. May consumer confidence missed forecasts but improved from the revised prior, nonetheless USD was initially unfazed. Looking ahead, Fed’s Kashkari (2020 vote) is slated for 1800BST, whilst tomorrow’s docket sees is light State-side with a lack of tier 1 data whilst non-voter Bullard speaks on the pandemic.</p><p><strong>GBP, NZD, AUD</strong></p><p>Top beneficiaries of the broad substantial Dollar weakness and the risk-on sentiment across asset classes. Sterling prods 1.2350 heading into the EU close with added impetus from sources noting that EU are preparing to drop its \"maximalist\" approach to negotiations on fisheries with Britain in the next round of negotiations. Cable looks to end the EU session above a number of DMAs: 10 (1.2215), 50 (1.2276), 55 (1.2287) and 21 (1.2319), having printed an intraday base at 1.2175 and a current high around 1.2350. Elsewhere, AUD extended on gains from a base of 0.6543 to eye its 200 DMA to the upside at 0.6658. The Kiwi rises in tandem to its antipodean counterpart on the back of the same factors but sees additional tailwind from a wide-than-expected trade surplus. NZD/USD tests 0.6200 to the upside as it homes in its 100 DMA at 0.6208.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Overall on the front-foot as a function of a softer Buck, but gains remain muted relative to others G10s as dovish comments from ECB GC member Villeroy alluded to a longer period of negative rates and posited possible further measures – ahead of the June 4th meeting. Chief Economist Lane and VP de Guindos did little to change/add to the narrative, whilst sources on the ECB’s contingency plans on PSPP without the Bundesbank did little to sway the Single Currency. EUR/USD remains north of its 100 DMA (1.0958) heading into the European close, having traded in a current range of 1.0890-1.0980 ahead of its 200 DMA around 1.1010. De Guindos is expected to give some remarks on Bloomberg TV around the EU cash close, whilst tomorrow sees little on the data slate but ECB President Lagarde and VP de Guindos could emerge on the wires.</p><p><strong>CAD, JPY</strong></p><p>A concoction of risk appetite, higher oil prices, and a breach of support around 1.3850-60 saw USD/CAD eyeing a test of 1.3800 to the downside ahead of a slated text release from BoC’s outgoing Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins are at 2200BST. Meanwhile, USD/JPY succumbed to the USD weakness, but gains in the JPY remain limited as the risk appetite keeps JPY bulls at bay. The pair remains contained within its 10 and 50 DMAs at 107.40 and 107.90 respectively throughout the session amid a lack of fresh fundamental drivers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Again, the tone around the market sees EM FX firmer across the board heading into the EU close. However, the CNH remains the underperformer against the backdrop of US-Sino tensions and with the situation in Hong Kong adding fuel to the fire. USD/CNH remains little changed relative to EM peers, having printed a current intraday band of 7.1350-7.1510 as the pair eyes April industrial profits data. For reference, PBoC opted for another softer CNY fixing overnight, something which participants should keep on the radar amid the looming US Currency Manipulation report.</p><p>Modest upside seen in US equity futures post-data in which ES Jun’20 rose from 3004.40 to 3008.00, little reaction seen cross asset</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>WHATS GOING ON: </strong>Traders have returned from market holidays with force, and risk is trading firmer. Equity indices open with solid gains with the SPX and DJI trading with more than 2% gains at the open. All sectors open in the green with outperformance in Financials, Industrials and Energy, while defensives, Health Care, Staples and Utilities lag. In Europe, stocks are higher, with Financials and Cyclicals leading, while Health Care and Telecoms drag. The US Treasury curve is bear-steepening, the Dollar Index is 0.6% lower–despite China's PBOC fixing the yuan reference at the highest since Feb 2008, 7.1293–while risk-sensitive currencies and EMFX are stronger. Major crude benchmarks are between 50c and 70c higher. Citi's strategists attribute the upside to re-opening news globally, ramp-ups in US testing capability, and no new escalations on the US-China-Hong Kong front. Central bank talk has been dovish: ECB’s Villeroy has hinted a new action at next week’s meeting (ECB chief Lagarde tomorrow), while BOJ’s Kuroda also suggested it can loosen policy further, as has the PBOC; Fed’s Kashkari (voter, dove) speaks later. Bullard (non-voter, dove) is also on Fox Business at 12:30 ET /17:30 BST. At 10am the Conference Board will release the May consumer sentiment report, which is worth paying attention to (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-may-consumer-confidence-due-at-1000-edt-1500-bst-will-consumer-sector-rebound-like-manufacturing-has-26-05-2020\">click here</a>)</p><p><strong>VACCINE CANDIDATES:</strong> Novavax (NVAX) has begun a clinical Phase 1 trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, with the first trial participants enrolled as well; preliminary results are expected to be released in July. Merck (MRK) has joined the vaccine race and has acquired Thermis and plans to start clinical studies on the vaccine within weeks, it is also working with IAVI with clinical studies planned to start later this year. MRK notes its antiviral candidate with RidgeBack Bio is already underway. Elsewhere, the WHO has temporarily paused tests on hydroxychloroquine (TEVA, MYL) due to safety concerns. Meanwhile, the NIH highlighted that Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir works best on patients who need extra oxygen but do not require medical ventilation.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>COVID sensitive names, Airlines (UAL, AAL, DAL, LUV) and Cruise Lines (CCL, NCLH, RCL) are performing well on economic reopening hopes. However, gains in airlines are likely being capped after the US government accused China of blocking US carriers from resuming flights to China, potentially tying in the industry to the souring relations between China and the US. Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) earnings beat on top and bottom line, SSS -1%, but better than the expected -5% print. AZO also noted that over the last four weeks of the quarter SSS turned meaningfully positive as the stimulus checks arrived to consumers. Eli Lilly (LLY) Phase 3 CONQUER study of its migraine drug, Emgality, found it improved work productivity and health and well-being between migraine attacks. Macy’s (M) announced it has begun to reopen stores gradually on a limited basis; notes in the stores that have already opened demand is higher than expected, reiterating sales are currently at 50% of 2019 levels. M expects Q2 to see a greater impact than Q1. Six Flags (SIX) announced it plans to reopen some of its parks from early June at limited capacity.</p><p><strong>ARE STOCKS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC?</strong> With stocks powering on ahead, despite little that has materially shifted in the underlying narrative, UBS asks whether stocks are looking too optimistic. The bank notes that global equities have recovered swiftly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the S&amp;P 500 ending last week 32% higher vs March lows. \"In our view, the rally has left major equity indexes fully valued on some measures,\" UBS says, \"for example, the S&amp;P 500 currently trades at 24.2x our estimate of 2020 earnings and 18.9x 2021 earnings, compared to the 20-year average trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 17.9x, and the 20-year average forward P/E of 16x.\" And it argues that, for this upside to catch a broad \"second wind\", investors will need greater confidence that a second wave of virus infections will not lead to renewed lockdowns. \"In particular, in this scenario we would see ample room for further gains in economically sensitive parts of the market which are lowly valued and have underperformed through the crisis so far.\"</p><p><strong>ES LEVELS TO WATCH: </strong>3397.50 (Feb'20 ATH); 3337.50 (Jan'20 ytd hi); 3181 (Jan'20 ytd lo); 3135 (78.6% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo); 3100 (psych); 3015 (May'20 hi today); 2998 (200dma); 2982-84 (Mon VAP - thin); 2963-66 (Mon VAP - thin); 2957 (FY21 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied); 2958 (5dma); 2955 (FY20 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied); 2948-50 (VAP); 2940-42 (VAP); 2930 (61.8% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo).</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p><p>European Commission President Von der Leyen will unveil the Commission’s Recovery Fund (RF) proposal on Wednesday (timing TBC), <strong>which will require unanimous backing to pass</strong>. This will be in addition to the already announced EUR 540bln package (including ESM, EIB, and the “SURE” instrument). Though the RF will provide EU countries some relief, <strong>consensus will also aid political relations among EU members, namely the North and South.</strong></p><p>France and Germany presented a package consisting solely of grants. However, this faces backlash from Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, and Sweden (dubbed the “frugal four”), who oppose the mutualisation of member states’ debt and favour loans. Thus, reports note that the Commission could propose a mix of loans and grants in a bid to reach a unanimous consensus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FRANCO-GERMAN PROPOSAL:</strong></p><p><strong>The nations proposed a fund of EUR 500bln of grants not loans</strong> – which will see the debt markets tapped with the Commission’s AAA rating to get favourable interest rates. This proposal posits that the distribution will take place through the EU long term budget for 2021-27. In terms of wider implications, the Franco-German proposal includes the introduction of a digital tax in the EU alongside a Common Corporate Tax Base, i.e. rules on what to tax the tech companies on as opposed to the amount taxed.</p><p><strong>FRUGAL FOUR PROPOSAL:</strong></p><p>The four Northern European countries (Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden) rejected the notion of grants in the proposal, as expected, and <strong>recommended an emergency fund financed only by loans.</strong> The proposal also does not permit for Commission issuance to increase the volume of financial resources available in the EU Budget – it proposes reprioritising and frontloading the existing EU Budget resources. Spanish PM Sanchez recently opposed a loan-based RF as it over-indebts peripheries such as Spain and Italy.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSAL</strong></p><p>President Von der Leyen reportedly proposed a 2yr EUR 500bln RF and a 7yr EU budget amounting to ~EUR 1tln<strong>. The RF will reportedly consist “mostly” of grants</strong> – whilst the exact grant/loan ratio (either 60/40 or 70/30) is yet to be determined, according to former European Commission’s Secretary-General Selmayr cited by Austrian Press - who later walked back on his comments amid the European Commission’s crackdown on internal leakers<strong>, and stressed that the touted figures are still under discussion.</strong></p><p><strong>LAUNCH DATE:</strong></p><p>An EU official in late April said the EU is looking to launch the recovery fund on 1st January 2021, whilst French Finance Minister Le Maire last week reaffirmed a 2021 date. <strong>European Council President Michel has to broker final accord</strong> – with a meeting between tomorrow and the 11th June Eurogroup yet to be scheduled. Late April, officials pointed to more clarity in June or July. <strong>Italy's Deputy Economy Minister Castelli said the country cannot wait until June for the approval recovery fund.</strong></p><p><strong>FINANCING:</strong></p><p>Desks note the cheapest way to finance the fund would be via joint EU debt at shorter maturities, then passed onto member states at low rates. Members have floated the idea of using perpetual bonds to finance the package. However, desks note that borrowing through perpetual bonds would mean a high degree of debt mutualisation and would be in contrast to what others (US, Germany) do when met with financing needs, i.e. relying on the short-end of the curve. ING argues the EU can use the balance sheet as two separate policy levers: “European loans given to member states should be long maturity in order to improve debt sustainability and reduce near-term gross financing needs. Instead, the financing of the loans, through the issuance of EU bonds, should rely more on the front-end of the yield curve to take full advantage of ECB’s accommodative monetary policy”, the Dutch bank says.</p><p><strong>WIDER POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS:</strong></p><p>It is no question that a consensus would improve sentiment among EU members<strong>. However, participants should also keep the likes of Italy on the radar amid rising anti-Euro sentiment</strong> in the region and with opposition parties looking for any chance to oust incumbent PM Conte. Analysts previously noted that the survival of the Euro could be at risk if EU leaders fail to understand the difficultly in Italy’s economic and political landscapes.</p>",

This would see Hong Kong’s special status removed that allowed it to function as an international financial hub.</li><li><strong>EU REACTION:</strong> The EU urged China to respect Hong Kong’s autonomy and the ‘One Country Two Systems’ principle and said it “considers that democratic debate, consultation of key stakeholders, and respect for protected rights and freedoms in Hong Kong would represent the best way of proceeding with the adoption of national security legislation”, whilst stating developments will be followed closely. Meanwhile, Hong Kong protests leader Joshua Wong said he wants the EU to impose sanctions on Chinese politicians over the law.</li><li><strong>UK REACTION:</strong> UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a 50yr agreement to the “one country, two systems” governance. Some believe Britain has too much at stake to confront China over Hong Kong; on this, new legal advice suggests the UK could open its doors to Hong Kong citizens. Meanwhile, Telegraph said PM Johnson was reportedly planning to reduce Huawei’s involvement in the UK 5G network within the next three years.</li></ul>",

In Europe, stocks are higher, with Financials and Cyclicals leading, while Health Care and Telecoms drag. The US Treasury curve is bear-steepening, the Dollar Index is 0.5% lower–despite China's PBOC fixing the yuan reference at the highest since Feb 2008, 7.1293–while risk-sensitive currencies and EMFX are stronger. Major crude benchmarks are between 50c and 85c higher. Citi's strategists attribute the upside to re-opening news globally, ramp-ups in US testing capability, and no new escalations on the US-China-Hong Kong front. Central bank talk has been dovish: ECB’s Villeroy has hinted a new action at next week’s meeting (chief economist Lane later, and ECB chief Lagarde tomorrow), while BOJ’s Kuroda also suggested it can loosen policy further, as has the PBOC; Fed’s Kashkari (voter, dove) speaks later. At 10am the Conference Board will release the May consumer sentiment report, which is worth paying attention to (see below).</p><p><strong>NEW VACCINE NEWS FLOW: </strong>News flow on vaccines has been mixed: with the Oxford Study only having a <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-oxford/project-leader-oxfords-covid-19-vaccine-trial-has-50-chance-of-success-telegraph-idUKKBN22Z0XC\">50% chance of success</a> against the 80% previously assumed, while researchers said the difference Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir made to death rates <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-gilead-sciences/nih-trial-gileads-drug-works-best-in-covid-patients-on-oxygen-idUSKBN22Y30B\">was not significant</a>. Nevertheless, last week’s testing drive by the US (Operation Warp Speed) is still providing confidence to investors, for now, and Novavax (NVAX) <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/novavax-trials-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-in-australia-2020-05-26\">began testing</a> its treatment in Australia, which has sent its stock around 20% higher in pre-market action.</p><p><strong>ES LEVELS TO WATCH: 3397.50 </strong>(Feb'20 ATH); <strong>3337.50 </strong>(Jan'20 ytd hi); <strong>3181 </strong>(Jan'20 ytd lo); <strong>3135 </strong>(78.6% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo); <strong>3100 </strong>(psych); <strong>3015 </strong>(May'20 hi today); <strong>2998 </strong>(200dma); <strong>2982-84 </strong>(Mon VAP - thin); <strong>2963-66 </strong>(Mon VAP - thin); <strong>2957 </strong>(FY21 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied); <strong>2958 </strong>(5dma); <strong>2955 </strong>(FY20 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied); <strong>2948-50</strong> (VAP); <strong>2940-42</strong> (VAP); <strong>2930</strong> (61.8% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo).</p><p><strong>ARE STOCKS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC? </strong>With stocks powering on ahead, despite little that has materially shifted in the underlying narrative, UBS asks whether stocks are looking too optimistic. The bank notes that global equities have recovered swiftly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the S&amp;P 500 ending last week 32% higher vs March lows. \"In our view, the rally has left major equity indexes fully valued on some measures,\" UBS says, \"for example, the S&amp;P 500 currently trades at 24.2x our estimate of 2020 earnings and 18.9x 2021 earnings, compared to the 20-year average trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 17.9x, and the 20-year average forward P/E of 16x.\" And it argues that, for this upside to catch a broad \"second wind\", investors will need greater confidence that a second wave of virus infections will not lead to renewed lockdowns. \"In particular, in this scenario we would see ample room for further gains in economically sensitive parts of the market which are lowly valued and have underperformed through the crisis so far.\"</p><p><strong>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AT 1000 EDT/1500 BST:</strong> Consensus looks for 88.0 in May (note the wide range of estimates: 52.9 to 96.0) versus 86.9 in April. Analysts will be watching if consumer sentiment can bounce back in May, as has been seen on the manufacturing side of the economy (Fed regional surveys have bounced back in May); if we can see signs that consumer sentiment is inflecting higher, it might suggest the worst is behind us, and Americans are gaining confidence in returning to work, and to begin consuming again, which will help the speed of the recovery. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-may-consumer-confidence-due-at-1000-edt-1500-bst-will-consumer-sector-rebound-like-manufacturing-has-26-05-2020\">Full preview</a>.

The signal to sell is driven by equity investor re-balancing needs, Citi says, as gains in equities has likely left them under-hedged. For Treasuries, UBS told clients to receive the long-end into month-end; the bank sees Treasury index extensions and COVID headlines as a key driver for the market. Says “Because of 20-year and 30-year new issuance, we think Treasury index will extend by 0.14 years versus the typical refunding average of 0.11 years,” and UBS thinks this is likely to push long-end yields lower.</p>",

In terms of over-arching macro themes, there hasn’t been much in the way of fresh fundamental catalysts since yesterday’s close, however, from a technical perspective, market participants may seek some encouragement from the e-mini moving back above the psychological 3000 mark. Additionally, looking at some of the top gainers thus far, the reopening narrative appears to be playing a key role once again. The main source of traction thus far has been in the travel &amp; leisure sector with UK-listed IAG (+15.4%), Intercontinental Hotels (+12.4%), easyJet (+11.6%) and Ryanair (+7.6%) all showing substantial gains from Friday’s close with optimism for the sector buoyed by ongoing border reopenings across the continent, whilst Deutsche Lufthansa (+5.3%) shares remain elevated after agreeing to a rescue deal with the German government. Asides from the travel &amp; leisure sector, reopening optimism can also be seen in names such as Cineworld (+18.7%), JD Sports (+9.7%) and Hammerson (+7.9%) with UK PM Johnson’s latest update noting that the government plans to allow car showrooms and outdoor markets to reopen from June 1st and will allow all non-essential retail to open from June 15th. Elsewhere, other notable movers include Rolls-Royce (+11.4%), who, asides from benefiting from recent optimism surrounding travel, are looking to negotiate price cuts with certain supplier. Finally, Wirecard (-1.6%) are off worst levels but lower nonetheless after delaying their earnings from 4th June to the 18th June on the basis that audits of annual financial statements for 2019 will not be completed by the planned date.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY -</strong> The Dollar continues its pullback early EU-doors, with little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts, but some estimates of month-end FX flows favour modest USD selling heading into the May 29th month-end fix.&nbsp; Looking ahead to the session, month-end factors are likely to influence the Buck in the current absence of fresh macro developments. Meanwhile, State-side data is unlikely to sway the Dollar much, but Fed’s Kashkari (2020 vote) is slated for 1800BST – who stated two weeks ago that there is unanimous opposition against NIRP, but refrained from ruling it out in the future. DXY has retreated further below the 99.500 mark (vs. high 99.979), with its 21 DMA coinciding with the psychological 99.000 mark.</p><p><strong>CNH, HKD</strong> - Notwithstanding Dollar softness, little action is seen in the currencies thus far. Political tensions remain elevated as Hong Kong’s special status assessment deadline at month-end, and with China threatening retaliation should US impose HK-related sanctions. Meanwhile, PBoC opted for another softer CNY fixing which participants should keep on the radar amid the looming US Currency Manipulation report. Offshore Yuan trades flat around 7.1450 vs. the USD and within a tight band. USD/HKD dipped below yesterday’s low at 7.7530 in early trade.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> EUR gains remain dimmed after dovish Villeroy alluded to a longer period of negative rates and posited possible further measures – ahead of the June 4th meeting. EUR/USD keeps its head above 1.0900 and eyes its 21 DMA at 1.0958 to the upside, having found an overnight base at 1.0890. Option expiries see EUR 720mln at 1.0900 and a some 1.3bln between 1.0935-45. Traders eye comments from ECB’s Chief Economist Lane (1345BST) and VP de Guindos (1630BST) for signs of agreement with Villeroy’s remarks.</p><p><strong>GBP, AUD, NZD, CAD -</strong> All beneficiaries of the USD pullback but the Aussie, Kiwi and Sterling outpace as risk appetite intensifies.&nbsp; Cable topped 1.2300 (vs. low 1.2175), after taking out its 50 DMA at 1.2275, 55 DMA at 1.2288 and a Fib 1.2292 (38.2% of the Apr-May fall) on the back of source reports that EU are preparing to drop its \"maximalist\" approach to negotiations on fisheries with Britain in the next round of negotiations. Furthermore, BoE’s Haldane said the UK economy likely contracted by over 20% in Q2, \"just a shade\" better than BoE's scenario of around 25%. The MPC member said the BoE has not reached remotely yet a view on NIRP. Elsewhere Aussie and Kiwi extended on APAC gains and surpassed 0.6600 and 0.6150 against the USD respectively vs. lows of 0.6535 and 0.6092 apiece. CAD meanwhile lags its high-beta peers but remains underpinned on favourable oil prices. USD/CAD gave up 1.3900 to the downside with support seen around the 1.3860 mark for the pair – whilst BoC’s outgoing Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins are slated for a text release at 2200BST.</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY -</strong> Mixed trade among the safe-haven FX – the Yen fails to benefit from the Dollar descend as risk appetite prompts haven outflows, whilst BoJ Governor Kuroda sung from the same hymn sheet regarding readiness to further loosen policy. USD/JPY failed to breach its 50 DMA (107.91) overnight but remains underpinned by the risk-on tone as focus remains on reopening economies and vaccine hopes in the absence of fundamental developments. The Franc ekes modest gains in a consolidation of yesterday’s weakness, USD/CHF dipped below 0.9700 and eyes its 55 DMA (0.9684) to the downside.</p><p>New Zealand Trade Balance (Apr) 1267M vs. Exp. 1235M (Prev. 672.0M, Rev. 722M). (Newswires) New Zealand Exports (Apr) 5.26B vs. Exp. 5.30B (Prev. 5.81B, Rev. 5.82B) New Zealand Imports (Apr) 3.99B vs. Exp. 4.00B (Prev. 5.14B, Rev. 5.09B)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>As markets are back in full swing after yesterday’s holiday closures in the UK and Stateside, core counterparts find themselves under sizeable pressure as risk sentiment remains strong after US equity futures rallied overnight; perhaps driven by the continued re-opening of global economies and updates on potential COVID-19 vaccines in focus. <strong>Bunds</strong> have slipped through several technical levels including mid-May lows at 172.26 at worst; albeit, the downside does appear to be capped by 172.00 itself with support also residing just below this at 171.95. Separately, today’s Schatz auction saw the strongest demand in 13-years with a bid-to-cover of 3.3x. Sticking with Germany, but also encapsulating the periphery, as the <strong>BTP-Bund</strong> spread has moved back below the 200bp mark for the first time since early-April. With attention on, and the spread assisted by, tomorrow’s presentation of the Franco-German recovery fund, which does present some risk given the clear opposition from the ‘Frugal Four’ alongside remarks overnight/this morning from ECB’s Villeroy intimating further PEPP related action is probable. Moving to the <strong>UK</strong>, which played catchup to the market holiday but is now similarly subdued given the overall risk tone and perhaps weighed on by positive source reports relating to the longstanding sticking point of fishing rights in Brexit talks. Crossing the pond to the <strong>US</strong>, price action is very similar to the aforementioned EU peers with focus for the session, and indeed the week, on the chunky supply out of the US which begins today with a USD 44bln 2-year note sale; currently, the curve is bear steepening.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and<strong> Brent </strong>front month futures continue to post gains, albeit the benchmarks have waned off highs in recent trade.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European indices have extended on yesterday’s gains (Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%) with the FTSE 100 (+1.4%) top of the pile as UK participants return from their extended weekend. In terms of over-arching macro themes, there hasn’t been much in the way of fresh fundamental catalysts since yesterday’s close, however, from a technical perspective, market participants may seek some encouragement from the e-mini moving back above the psychological 3000 mark. Additionally, looking at some of the top gainers thus far, the reopening narrative appears to be playing a key role once again. The main source of traction thus far has been in the travel &amp; leisure sector with UK-listed IAG (+15.4%), Intercontinental Hotels (+12.4%), easyJet (+11.6%) and Ryanair (+7.6%) all showing substantial gains from Friday’s close with optimism for the sector buoyed by ongoing border reopenings across the continent, whilst Deutsche Lufthansa (+5.3%) shares remain elevated after agreeing to a rescue deal with the German government. Asides from the travel &amp; leisure sector, reopening optimism can also be seen in names such as Cineworld (+18.7%), JD Sports (+9.7%) and Hammerson (+7.9%) with UK PM Johnson’s latest update noting that the government plans to allow car showrooms and outdoor markets to reopen from June 1st and will allow all non-essential retail to open from June 15th. Elsewhere, other notable movers include Rolls-Royce (+11.4%), who, asides from benefiting from recent optimism surrounding travel, are looking to negotiate price cuts with certain supplier. Finally, Wirecard (-1.6%) are off worst levels but lower nonetheless after delaying their earnings from 4th June to the 18th June on the basis that audits of annual financial statements for 2019 will not be completed by the planned date.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>DXY - The Dollar continues its pullback early EU-doors, with little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts, but some estimates of month-end FX flows favour modest USD selling heading into the May 29th month-end fix.&nbsp; Looking ahead to the session, month-end factors are likely to influence the Buck in the current absence of fresh macro developments. Meanwhile, State-side data is unlikely to sway the Dollar much, but Fed’s Kashkari (2020 vote) is slated for 1800BST – who stated two weeks ago that there is unanimous opposition against NIRP, but refrained from ruling it out in the future. DXY has retreated further below the 99.500 mark (vs. high 99.979), with its 21 DMA coinciding with the psychological 99.000 mark.</p><p>CNH, HKD - Notwithstanding Dollar softness, little action is seen in the currencies thus far. Political tensions remain elevated as Hong Kong’s special status assessment deadline at month-end, and with China threatening retaliation should US impose HK-related sanctions. Meanwhile, PBoC opted for another softer CNY fixing which participants should keep on the radar amid the looming US Currency Manipulation report. Offshore Yuan trades flat around 7.1450 vs. the USD and within a tight band. USD/HKD dipped below yesterday’s low at 7.7530 in early trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EUR - EUR gains remain dimmed after dovish Villeroy alluded to a longer period of negative rates and posited possible further measures – ahead of the June 4th meeting. EUR/USD keeps its head above 1.0900 and eyes its 21 DMA at 1.0958 to the upside, having found an overnight base at 1.0890. Option expiries see EUR 720mln at 1.0900 and a some 1.3bln between 1.0935-45. Traders eye comments from ECB’s Chief Economist Lane (1345BST) and VP de Guindos (1630BST) for signs of agreement with Villeroy’s remarks.</p><p>GBP, AUD, NZD, CAD - All beneficiaries of the USD pullback but the Aussie, Kiwi and Sterling outpace as risk appetite intensifies.&nbsp; Cable topped 1.2300 (vs. low 1.2175), after taking out its 50 DMA at 1.2275, 55 DMA at 1.2288 and a Fib 1.2292 (38.2% of the Apr-May fall) on the back of source reports that EU are preparing to drop its \"maximalist\" approach to negotiations on fisheries with Britain in the next round of negotiations. Furthermore, BoE’s Haldane said the UK economy likely contracted by over 20% in Q2, \"just a shade\" better than BoE's scenario of around 25%. The MPC member said the BoE has not reached remotely yet a view on NIRP. Elsewhere Aussie and Kiwi extended on APAC gains and surpassed 0.6600 and 0.6150 against the USD respectively vs. lows of 0.6535 and 0.6092 apiece. CAD meanwhile lags its high-beta peers but remains underpinned on favourable oil prices. USD/CAD gave up 1.3900 to the downside with support seen around the 1.3860 mark for the pair – whilst BoC’s outgoing Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins are slated for a text release at 2200BST.</p><p>CHF, JPY - Mixed trade among the safe-haven FX – the Yen fails to benefit from the Dollar descend as risk appetite prompts haven outflows, whilst BoJ Governor Kuroda sung from the same hymn sheet regarding readiness to further loosen policy. USD/JPY failed to breach its 50 DMA (107.91) overnight but remains underpinned by the risk-on tone as focus remains on reopening economies and vaccine hopes in the absence of fundamental developments. The Franc ekes modest gains in a consolidation of yesterday’s weakness, USD/CHF dipped below 0.9700 and eyes its 55 DMA (0.9684) to the downside.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>As markets are back in full swing after yesterday’s holiday closures in the UK and Stateside, core counterparts find themselves under sizeable pressure as risk sentiment remains strong after US equity futures rallied overnight; perhaps driven by the continued re-opening of global economies and updates on potential COVID-19 vaccines in focus. <strong>Bunds</strong> have slipped through several technical levels including mid-May lows at 172.26 at worst; albeit, the downside does appear to be capped by 172.00 itself with support also residing just below this at 171.95. Separately, today’s <strong>Schatz</strong> auction saw the strongest demand in 13-years with a bid-to-cover of 3.3x. Sticking with Germany, but also encapsulating the periphery, as the <strong>BTP</strong>-<strong>Bund</strong> spread has moved back below the 200bp mark for the first time since early-April. With attention on, and the spread assisted by, tomorrow’s presentation of the Franco-German recovery fund, which does present some risk given the clear opposition from the ‘Frugal Four’ alongside remarks overnight/this morning from ECB’s Villeroy intimating further PEPP related action is probable. Moving to the <strong>UK</strong>, which played catchup to the market holiday but is now similarly subdued given the overall risk tone and perhaps weighed on by positive source reports relating to the longstanding sticking point of fishing rights in Brexit talks. Crossing the pond to the <strong>US</strong>, price action is very similar to the aforementioned EU peers with focus for the session, and indeed the week, on the chunky supply out of the US which begins today with a USD 44bln 2-year note sale; currently, the curve is bear steepening.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures continue to post gains, albeit the benchmarks have waned off highs in recent trade. Eyes remain on the wider implications on global trade and sentiment from the fallout of the US-Sino trade spat threatening a cold war, whilst investors must not be distraction from the prospects of reinstated lockdowns should COVID-19 cases rise again. On the supply front- Russian Energy Minister Novak is to reportedly meet with Russian oil majors to discuss an extension of current cuts past the end of June – the checkpoint for OPEC to reduce output curbs. Aside from that, news flow for the complex remained light in early EU hours. On the data front, the weekly Private inventories will be watched tomorrow – particularly in regards to Cushing storage. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> July remain north of USD 34/bbl and USD 36/bbl respectively having printed bases at USD 32.50/bbl and USD 35.50/bbl apiece. <strong>Spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> succumbs to the risk apetite and see modest outflows, with losses cushioned by the weaker Buck as the yellow metal straddles USD 1725/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices post decent gains amid the risk tone and softer Dollar – with prices eyeing USD 2.45/lb to the upside.</p>",

        "content": "<p>As markets are back in full swing after yesterday’s holiday closures in the UK and Stateside, core counterparts find themselves under sizeable pressure as risk sentiment remains strong after US equity futures rallied overnight; perhaps driven by the continued re-opening of global economies and updates on potential COVID-19 vaccines in focus. Bunds have slipped through a number of technical levels including mid-May lows at 172.26 at worst; albeit, the downside does appear to be capped by 172.00 itself with support also residing just below this at 171.95. Separately, today’s Schatz auction saw the strongest demand in 13-years with a bid-to-cover of 3.3x. Sticking with Germany, but also encapsulating the periphery, as the BTP-Bund spread has moved back below the 200bp mark for the first time since early-April. With attention on, and the spread assisted by, tomorrow’s presentation of the Franco-German recovery fund, which does present some risk given the clear opposition form the ‘Frugal Four’ alongside remarks overnight/this morning from ECB’s Villeroy intimating further PEPP related action is probable. Moving to the UK, which played catchup to the market holiday but is now similarly subdued given the overall risk tone and perhaps weighed on by positive source reports relating to the longstanding sticking point of fishing rights in Brexit talks. Crossing the pond to the US, price action is very similar to the aforementioned EU peers with focus for the session, and indeed the week, on the chunky supply out of the US which begins today with a USD 44bln 2-year note sale; currently, the curve is bear steepening.</p>",

Despite rising stock markets (positive for Americans 401K retirement plans), improving COVID metrics, the level of people filing for claims is still very high; while that will likely prove temporary as economies start re-opening, the sustainability of better consumer confidence will be influenced by how many people are able to get re-hired, and get back to work quickly, BMO argues.</p>",

Fed officials have continued to push-back against negative rates, yet markets continue to assign a non-zero possibility they will be seen by the middle of next year. This pricing might exists for two reasons: the first is practical, and will be related to hedging scenarios by some players, given rates are at historic lows; the other is due to the unknowns about how COVID will play out, and if re-openings result in a lock down more severe than the first; the Fed has already brought rates down to historic lows, and has already boosted liquidity and added programmes to help stabilise markets, the question is what further significant measures they can do. The onus seems to be on fiscal policymakers, and at present, there seems to be a reduced political will for further stimulus.</p><p><strong>YCC AHEAD:</strong> Last week’s Fed minutes offered some insight on yield curve control, with ‘several’ policymakers seeing merit in the tool. BMO does not see this is a near-term transition for the Fed, but it may be a tool for the Fed if the recovery stumbles or takes longer than market participants are anticipating. In practice, the bank says that YCC would be the Fed augmenting its forward guidance rather than anything revolutionary, emphasising that rates will remain low; so if yields, say up to 5-year maturities, rise beyond a certain point (say, 0.25%), the Fed will buy and bring them back down. In terms of the current environment, with 5-year yields already at around 35bps, an announcement of YCC would help to engineer a small rally in the belly, but much has already been priced in, BMO thinks. One advantage of the policy is that if the Fed were to communicate YCC well, it might not even need to buy anything extra, since the market will know there is a price-insensitive amount of demand above whatever the yield cap is, and will immediately price to the cap or below. As long as the Fed has a credible commitment of demand at that point, the market will incorporate lower rates for longer, which is what the FOMC wants.</p><p><strong>2-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.229%, six-auction average 1.085%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -1.2bps, six-auction avg. 0.2bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 3.11x, six-auction avg. 2.59x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 26.4%, six-auction avg. 32.1%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 17.8%, six-auction avg. 17.8%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 55.8%, six-auction avg. 50.1%)</li></ul><p><strong>5-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.394%, six-auction average 1.145%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.74x, six-auction avg. 2.51x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 19.4%, six-auction avg. 25.4%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 20.2%, six-auction avg. 14.4%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 60.4%, six-auction avg. 60.2%)</li></ul><p><strong>7-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.525%, six-auction average 1.263%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.1bps, six-auction avg. -0.3bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.56x, six-auction avg. 2.52x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 21.3%, six-auction avg. 22.7%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 12.3%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.1%)</li></ul>",

The signal to sell is driven by equity investor re-balancing needs, Citi says, as gains in equities has likely left them under-hedged.</li><li><strong>TREASURIES:</strong> UBS told clients to receive the long-end into month-end; the bank sees Treasury index extensions and COVID headlines as a key driver for the market. Says “Because of 20-year and 30-year new issuance, we think Treasury index will extend by 0.14 years versus the typical refunding average of 0.11 years,” and UBS thinks this is likely to push long-end yields lower.</li><li><strong>EQUITIES: </strong>Morgan Stanley's QDS Pension Rebalancing Model estimates that there should be modest outflows (of around USD 24bln) from equities over May month-end (mostly out of the US) if pensions re-balance back to target weights.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong>,</p><p>The Dollar continues its pullback early EU-doors, with little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts, but some estimates of month-end FX flows favour modest USD selling heading into the May 29th month-end fix.&nbsp; Looking ahead to the session, month-end factors are likely to influence the Buck in the current absence of fresh macro developments. Meanwhile, State-side data is unlikely to sway the Dollar much, but Fed’s Kashkari (2020 vote) is slated for 1800BST – who stated two weeks ago that there is unanimous opposition against NIRP, but refrained from ruling it out in the future. DXY has retreated below the 99.500 mark (vs. high 99.979), with its 21 DMA coinciding with the psychological 99.000 mark.</p><p><strong>CNH, HKD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding Dollar softness, little action is seen in the currencies thus far. Political tensions remain elevated as Hong Kong’s special status assessment deadline at month-end, and with China threatening retaliation should US impose HK-related sanctions. Meanwhile, PBoC opted for another softer CNY fixing which participants should keep on the radar amid the looming US Currency Manipulation report. Offshore Yuan trades flat around 7.1450 vs. the USD and within a tight band. USD/HKD dipped below yesterday’s low at 7.7530 in early trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>EUR gains remain dimmed after dovish Villeroy alluded to a longer period of negative rates and posited possible further measures – ahead of the June 4th meeting. EUR/USD keeps its head above 1.0900 and eyes its 21 DMA at 1.0958 to the upside, having found an overnight base at 1.0890. Option expiries see EUR 720mln at 1.0900 and a some 1.3bln between 1.0935-45. Traders eye comments from ECB’s Chief Economist Lane (1345BST) and VP de Guindos (1630BST) for signs of agreement with Villeroy’s remarks.</p><p><strong>GBP, AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>All beneficiaries of the USD pullback but the Aussie, Kiwi and Sterling outpace as risk appetite intensifies.&nbsp; Cable edges higher closer 1.2300 (vs. low 1.2175), but the pair faces its 50 DMA at 1.2275, 55 DMA at 1.2288 and a Fib 1.2292 (38.2% of the Apr-May fall) ahead of the round figure. Aussie and Kiwi extended on APAC gains and eye 0.6600 and 0.6150 against the USD respectively vs. lows of 0.6535 and 0.6092 apiece. CAD meanwhile lags its high-beta peers but remains underpinned on favourable oil prices. USD/CAD eyes 1.3900 to the downside with support seen around the 1.3860 mark for the pair – whilst BoC’s outgoing Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins are slated for a text release at 2200BST.</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong></p><p>Mixed trade among the safe-haven FX – the Yen fails to benefit from the Dollar descend as risk appetite prompts haven outflows, whilst BoJ Governor Kuroda sung from the same hymn sheet regarding readiness to further loosen policy. USD/JPY failed to breach its 50 DMA (107.91) overnight but remains underpinned by the risk-on tone as focus remains on reopening economies and vaccine hopes in the absence of fundamental developments. The Franc ekes modest gains in a consolidation of yesterday’s weakness, USD/CHF dipped below 0.9700 and eyes its 55 DMA (0.9684) to the downside.</p>",

(+0.7%)</strong> also conformed to the positive tone with the surge in Hong Kong attributed to dip buying and with sentiment underpinned after the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos for the first time in almost 2 months, while PBoC Governor Yi reiterated that prudent monetary policy will be more flexible and that they will strengthen macro policy, as well as counter cyclical adjustments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were range bound with prices marginally higher amid mixed results at the 40yr JGB auction and despite the gains in stocks, while there were comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who reiterated the central bank stands ready to act further through various policy tools and suggested that they will conduct appropriate easing measures after the coronavirus is contained.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 10bln via 7-Day Reverse Repos and maintained the rate at 2.20% and announced a CNY 5.0bln central bank bill swap operation today.

ASX 200 (+2.4%) was lifted as all sectors traded positive and with notable gains seen in both financials and energy, while Nikkei 225 (+2.7%) outperformed as exporters cheered a weaker currency and after PM Abe formally lifted the nationwide state of emergency. Hang Seng (+2.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) also conformed to the positive tone with the surge in Hong Kong attributed to dip buying and with sentiment underpinned after the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos for the first time in almost 2 months, while PBoC Governor Yi reiterated that prudent monetary policy will be more flexible and that they will strengthen macro policy, as well as counter cyclical adjustments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were range bound with prices marginally higher amid mixed results at the 40yr JGB auction and despite the gains in stocks, while there were comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who reiterated the central bank stands ready to act further through various policy tools and suggested that they will conduct appropriate easing measures after the coronavirus is contained.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board and US equity futures also extend on gains as trade picks up from the holiday lull and given the lack of fresh catalysts to force a shift in the recent constructive narrative. ASX 200 (+1.8%) is lifted as all sectors trade positive and with notable gains seen in both financials and energy, while Nikkei 225 (+2.2%) outperforms as exporters cheer a weaker currency and after PM Abe formally lifted the nationwide state of emergency. Hang Seng (+1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) also conform to the positive tone with the surge in Hong Kong attributed to dip buying and with sentiment underpinned after the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos for the first time in almost 2 months, while PBoC Governor Yi reiterated that prudent monetary policy will be more flexible and that they will strengthen macro policy, as well as counter cyclical adjustments.</p><p>The DXY continues to retreat further below the 100.00 level with the risk tone as the main driver for overnight price action across the FX space and has benefitted most major currencies with EUR/USD extending above the 1.0900 level but with gains somewhat limited by recent comments from ECB’s Villeroy who suggested the ECB will likely need to act further. GBP/USD also strengthened against the greenback and reclaimed the 1.2200 handle despite the ongoing backlash due to PM Johnson’s support of his top adviser Cummings who refused to resign or apologise for the lockdown breach. On the other hand, PM Johnson had announced that retailers will soon reopen including car showrooms and outdoor markets from June 1st, as well as all non-essential retail from June 15th. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses coat-tail on the positive risk appetite which has also underpinned antipodeans, but with upside capped by the ongoing Aussie-Sino tiff and after the PBoC continued to weaken the CNY reference rate to levels not seen since the GFC.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are stable heading into the 40yr JGB auction with prices marginally higher despite the gains in stocks, while there were comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who reiterated the central bank stands ready to act further through various policy tools and suggested that they will conduct appropriate easing measures after the coronavirus is contained.</p>",
