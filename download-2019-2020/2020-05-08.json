Click <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24485/download\">here</a> for full report.</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Overnight news that US/China trade officials held a call supported risk sentiment (officials to move forward with phase one); ES printed a high overnight, busting through 2,900, which had proved stiff resistance, and has been consolidating/moving horizontally since, although a late session ramp saw new highs made in thin trade, perhaps supported by positive developments on US/Saudi ties after a White House announcement suggesting Trump had held constructive calls with the Kingdom. The VIX fell beneath 30 for the first time since it blew up. A grim NFP report broke a few records and gave us a snapshot of a hammered economy, but ultimately offers little by way of new information to price in; both the Atlanta Fed and NY Fed’s GDP trackers are now tracking Q2 annualised growth at -34.9% and -31.2% respectively; the key, of course, is how quickly economies can reopen, and how long it takes to ‘normalise’ (if ever) – that is perhaps why the trade news offered some upside. Elsewhere, Treasury yields endured a roller-coaster day; there was steepening after the NFP report, which was then met by flattening (2s saw a new record low); negative rates is a theme the street is watching closely after some Fed funds futures rose above par on Thursday/Friday; Powell speaks next week, and his comments will be eyed (he has previously argued against negative rates) – Fed announcd it would be tapering its purchases further (USD 7bln per day from 8bln) which saw rates rise further in the later session.&nbsp;</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer spoke over the phone and agreed to keep communications, strengthen cooperation and vowed efforts to implement the phase 1 deal. The sides reportedly agreed to work together to create a beneficial environment for carrying out the trade deal, while they agreed good progress was made to make deal a success and that both sides fully expect obligations to be met. Subsequently, SCMP reported that a Chinese Gov’t Adviser, on the US-China phone call, suggested that the fact that “the dialogue has now gone straight to ministerial level may indicate the problem is quite severe”. This was later followed by US President Trump noting he is having a hard time with China in regard to the deal, although no final decision has yet been made. NEC Director Kudlow held the same view, noting the relationship is complex, adding they have not been transparent and will be held accountable once the final results are in, although he did not say how. China has now also been called on by the US Chamber of Commerce to dramatically accelerate its US good purchases under the Phase One trade deal as China’s economy returns to normality.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The<strong> </strong>White House stated it hopes to have a phase 4 COVID-19 stimulus package soon and encouraged the House of Representatives to reconvene, Pelosi was hopeful they would return next week. The WH added negotiations on another bill would happen. US President Trump, however, did note they are in no rush to negotiate a new package. NEC Director Kudlow said he expects a pause on further COVID-19 stimulus this month, but added that incentives for US suppliers to repatriate the companies are being considered, and the administration is considering making business expenditures for virus safety tax detectible. White House Economic Adviser Hassett noted the payroll tax cuts would only be present in the next package. Note, reports yesterday suggested the White House was considering a further tax filing deadline delay, to either September or December, or even options that would not require legislation. Analysts have suggested the only viable option of the two would be to extend the tax deadline.</p><p><strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP: </strong>When asked about today’s jobs report, President Trump noted the lost jobs would be back soon. He noted some states, such as California, could possibly move towards a quicker reopening.</p><p><strong>NEC DIRECTOR KUDLOW</strong> noted the jobs numbers would continue to deteriorate, but there will be positive numbers in H2 20, while he also suggested three-quarters of the jobs lost in April are temporary layoffs.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>ECB: </strong>The ECB has reportedly asked staff to study if the Central Bank should purchase junk Corporate Bonds to fight the COVID-19 fallout, policymakers are under pressure to mimic the Fed on junk debt, but doubts still remain, sources reported. Note, ECB President Lagarde when asked about junk bonds she noted the ECB did not discuss purchasing junk bonds under its APP. In her speech today she noted that the ECB will play its full part within its mandate, echoing the ECB’s announcement in response to the German Court ruling. She emphasised there should be no undue constraints on policy response. On the fiscal front, Lagarde noted government financing might need to exceed 10% of GDP this year</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 11 TICKS LOWER AT 138-30+</strong></p><p>The TPLEX endured an erratic session as participants digested a less-dire-than-expected NFP print – albeit still a record slump – as well as another push towards NIRP. The T-Note had been modestly firming overnight before it legged lower on the release of the NFP report, amid a wider risk on environment. However, the losses in the TPLEX soon reversed course not long after the cash equity open, led by another rally in short rates, which saw shorter maturity Fed Funds futures move above par, seeing the 2-year yield print a new all-time low of 10.5bps. The sharp move lower pared heading into the latest NY Fed USTs purchases schedule announcement, which saw the Fed taper its daily purchases to around USD 7bln per day from around USD 8bln. Looking at the changes within the buckets, it kept its long-end purchases unchanged (20- to 30-year) but made the largest proportion of cuts at the front-end – perhaps to counter the recent leg lower in front-end yields towards NIRP as well as addressing recent steepening post the Treasury quarterly refunding announcement. Following the updated schedule release, yields continued to edge higher, to which by settlement, all yields along the curve had risen on the session: 2s +2.5bps at 0.15%, 5s +3bps at 0.33%, 10s +5bps at 0.68%, 30s +7bps at 1.39%.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong> Fed Funds futures made further forays above par on Friday, with the November contract joining the December one above par. There was no Fedspeak on Friday, but we will be looking closely at remarks from officials in the days ahead (particularly Kashkari and Powell, the latter speaks next week). Powell has previously said the FFR had hit its effective lower bound here at the zero lower bound, but as short rates continue to push into NIRP – some have highlighted the recent ramp-up of options activity around par value Eurodollar strikes and the Fed Funds futures curve falling further – the Fed will likely need to take a firmer foot to tame the market, analysts suggest. Elsewhere, White House Economic Advisor Hassett said today that if the Fed decided to push interest rates negative, he would be supportive of it, but noted he respects the Fed’s independence and would not want to advise it – perhaps an indication of some willingness for NIRP from Washington, although officials such as Trump and Mnuchin have previously expressed aversion.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 1.19 HIGHER AT USD 24.74/BBL, WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 1.34 HIGHER AT USD 26.17/BBL; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 1.51 HIGHER AT USD 30.97/BBL</strong></p><p>A choppy session for the crude complex but ultimately prices were firmer. The gains appeared to be taking their cues from renewed risk appetite, as seen in the equity complex, in lack of significant updates on the energy front. However, some had attributed late-session gains to reports that PEMEX’s trading arm, PMI, had declared a partial force majeure on fuel cargoes and has also deferred other until the second half of the year. The latest US Baker Hughes rig count saw oil rigs cut by 36 to 338, nat gas rigs cut by 1 to 80 (leaving total rigs down 34 at 374). EOG Resources, a large player in US shale, was the latest to announce further capex cuts in its earnings report, as well as noting that it had significantly cut back its operating rigs. Oil bulls will want to start seeing the reduction in oil drilling activity begin feeding through into storage draws, particularly as US inventories continue to print chunky builds – something which could come back to bite June WTI futures which are due to expire May 19th.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>NFP:</strong> A record number of Americans lost their jobs in April, the BLS Employment Situation Report noted, with -20.5mln reported (expected -22mln); Cumulatively, the job losses during the COVID fallout now stands at 21.4mln. The jobless rate spiked to 14.7% (biggest rise in history) to a new record high, which was slightly better than the 16.0% the street had modelled; it might have been 5ppts higher if not for the mislabelling of those ‘absent from work for other reasons’, Oxford Economics said. Meanwhile, the U6 ‘underemployment rate’ jumped to 22.8% from 8.7%; and labour force participation rate fell dramatically, down 2.5ppts to 60.2%, the lowest since January 1973. Average hourly earnings surged to the highest monthly rate ever (+4.8% M/M and 7.9% Y/Y); “This should not serve as any consolation as it reflects a large composition effect with low-wage sectors suffering massive job losses,” Oxford Economics argues, “average weekly hours rose 0.3%, but the aggregate weekly hours index plunged, while aggregate weekly payrolls plummeted.” The report should serve as evidence that the significant damage inflicted to communities throughout the country by the ‘Great Coronavirus recession’, OxEco says, and it anticipates that the severe income loss, elevated precautionary savings and lingering virus fear will curtail consumer demand well past the lockdowns. “Going forward, the interplay of partial rehiring by small businesses in the wake of the Paycheck Protection Program and lingering economic damage means the labour market may be difficult to read,” adding that, “still, while we expect some jobs will be recovered over the coming months, we anticipate an unemployment rate well above 10% by year-end.”</p><p><strong>CANADA JOBS (APR):</strong> Headline employment fell by 1.994mln jobs in April, faring better than the 4.0mln job losses expected by the street, although it was very much in line with whisper number heading into the release. The breakdown saw full time employment -1.47mln from -474k, while part time jobs declined 522k following a 534k job decline previously. Unemployment rose to 13% from 7.8%, beating expectations for a rise to 18%; Capital Economics suggests this is a result of those who had lost jobs not yet looking for re-employment, therefore not meeting data criteria. If they were counted, the unemployment rate would have been 17.8%. The report fared better than expected, although overall still a grim situation. CapEco highlights that with some provinces starting to reopen, the worst for employment seems to be behind us. The consultancy points out that StatsCan noted there 5.5mln people were either not employed or working substantially reduced hours; ~25% of February’s employment.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.68% at 2929, NDQ +1.30% at 9220, DJIA +1.91% at 24331.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy +4.34%, Industrials +2.5%, Materials +2.4%, Cons Stpl +2.27%, Financials +2.19%, Utilities +2.01%, Real Estate +1.87%, Cons Disc +1.66%, Communication Svs +1.57%, Technology +1.4%, Health +0.54%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Ford (F) announced it is aiming to begin its phased restart in North America from May 18th; it was also downgraded to junk at Fitch. Walt Disney Company (DIS) announced it is to reopen its Disney Springs in the US in a phased manner from May 20th; it also sold out of all its Shanghai reopening Disneyland tickets. Microsoft (MSFT) reported that Amazon (AMZN) has filed another protest of its USD 10bln JEDI contract with the Department of Defence, although the complaint is confidential therefore MSFT is unaware of the details. JPMorgan (JPM) in a 10Q filing restated its NII guidance (revised higher) and cut its expense guidance; it now sees FY20 NII to be around USD 56bln, and adjusted expenses sub USD 65bln in FY20; Q2 NII view at around USD 14bln. Tesla (TSLA) had made plans to reopen its Fremont, California factory today, according to an email, although local authorities suggested it had not been given the go-ahead for.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Uber (UBER) missed on EPS, while revenue and MAU’s were in line with expectations, gross bookings beat. Microchip (MCHP) beat on EPS while revenue was inline, however, guidance was weaker than expected. TripAdvisor (TRIP) missed on EPS and revenue while it expects to see a significantly negative EBITDA in Q2. Booking Holdings (BKNG) saw a large EPS miss, although revenues were slightly firmer than expected.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>ESM: </strong>Eurozone governments agreed on cheap credit lines for countries hit by the pandemic. The ESM coronavirus credit line loan is to be for up to 10-years maturity and will be operational from June 1st. The Eurogroup Chief Centeno said there would be no strings attached to the facility. However, Italian PM Conte said EU aid is insufficient and a recovery fund is needed. Note, the EU Commission yesterday noted that ESM use would not require a macro adjustment programme. The Commission said that enhanced surveillance linked to the ESM use would only focus on funds being used for COVID-19 health care costs, and that use by countries will not involve ad hoc on-site missions from the Commission. Furthermore, surveillance linked to ESM use would end as soon as the money has been spent. The announcement appeared to make it more politically palatable for countries to utilise the ESM, such as Italy, which has raised issues with the potential conditions alongside it, which opponents fear could be too arduous.</p><p><strong>GERMAN COURT RULING: </strong>German Finance Minister Sholz is reportedly requesting officials check whether the ECP’s Asset Purchase Programme meets the principles of proportionality defined by the German Constitutional Court after it ruled it did not respect the “Principle of proportionality” where the ECB now have 3-months to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank “may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue”. However, Scholz later noted he was confident there would be a solution which would allow the Bundesbank to keep purchasing bonds after the deadline expires, while insisting this is a German issue and not an ECB issue.</p><h2>WEEKLY FX WRAP</h2><p><strong>NFP, GCC, CENTRAL BANK POLICY AND COVID-19 ACRIMONY</strong></p><p><strong>USD: </strong>The Dollar continues its recovery from or rather stabilisation off recent lows, albeit with the DXY unable to maintain momentum above 100.000 amidst a broadly risk positive end to the week and with Fed Fund Futures tipping over the same level from the Dec20 contract to imply negative rates by the end of the year. The Buck has largely dismissed bad data (NFP for example) and mostly bleak survey-based indicators (like regional Fed findings, PMIs and ISMs) on the basis that measures implemented to try and contain the spread of nCoV have effectively shut down the economy beyond essential output and spending on necessities, with worse to come as Q2/2020 unfolds and many other nations facing similar pandemic-related repercussions. On that note, the Greenback has derived impetus from the plight of other currencies but topped out after a brief breach of a Fib retracement level (99.930) within a 100.400-99.239 weekly range.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD: </strong>The Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all on track to end Friday’s EU session close to best levels of the week vs their US counterpart, and aside from a broad recovery in risk sentiment several specific or independent factors have impacted. NZ recorded zero new cases of coronavirus and is on the verge of lifting lockdown ahead of next week’s RBNZ policy meeting, while Australian retail sales and trade data were supportive either side of the RBA that struck a balance between ensuring stimulus is maintained and fine-tuning QE in accordance with financial market conditions. Elsewhere, some much needed stability in crude markets and a net rebound in oil prices underpinned the Cad to the extent that 2mln job losses and more contractionary Ivey PMIs have been taken in stride.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF: </strong>A solid end to the week for the Pound on all counts, but this does not begin to tell the full story as Cable has been extremely whippy between 1.2503-1.2267 parameters and Eur/Gbp from just under 0.8700 to a similar margin above 0.8800. In short, Sterling seems to have been subject to so called ‘seasonal’ weakness, while paying some heed to the remaining dire UK PMIs, keeping a close vigil on domestic virus developments and a dovish BoE super Thursday on balance. To recap, 2 MPC members dissented for a Gbp 100 bn increase in the APF and Governor Bailey said after the event that the Bank may yet decide to lift bond purchases in June. Meanwhile, the Euro had other bearish issues to deal with and namely Germany’s Constitutional Court ruling that the lack of proportionality in the ECB’s PSPP contravenes national law and the EU Treaty principles. However, the retort from GC members including President Lagarde has been resolute in that the policy is within mandate and backed by the ECJ with the express aim of reaching the inflation mandate and making sure that transmission extends to all parts of the Eurozone economy and areas of the bloc. Elsewhere, the Franc has finally acknowledged (to a degree) the strenuous efforts expended by the SNB to curb its strength, but it took reserves data to ram the message home after consecutive weeks of marked increases in Swiss bank sight deposit balances, with a little help from deeper CPI deflation.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM:</strong> Volatile trade for the Norwegian and Swedish Kronas, but ultimately a resumption of their partly technical and also fundamental bull trends as the former was only fleetingly derailed by an unexpected Norges Bank rate cut to zero that was supplemented by extended F-loans. However, the updated depo path signalled 0% for the forecast horizon and although Governor Olsen did not rule out NIRP he chimed with the projection indicating no further easing after the 25 bp reduction. Similarly, last week’s hawkish Riksbank hold kept the Sek on an upward trajectory, albeit with a weak Eur compounding, even though PMIs and data were disappointing. On the EM front, a week of contrasting fortunes, but roughly divided and driven by related oil and commodity price movements as the Rub, Mxn and Zar mainly outperformed peers and the Usd, but the Try suffered more angst to plumb new all time lows before paring some losses after the Turkish banking authority issued bans against trading FX to 3 foreign banks. Last, but by no means least the Yuan was hit by concerns about US-China relations after President Trump heighted his vitriol over the cause of COVID-19 and threatened more tariffs in retaliation, but regrouped after reports that top trade officials from both countries had agreed to talk about Phase 1 and the conversation was said to have been ‘constructive’.&nbsp; However, the Brl also plunged to a fresh record trough after the BCB eased by more than expected (Selic down 75 bp vs -½ point consensus) hot on the heels of Fitch downgrading Brazil’s outlook to negative, in contrast to the Czk that coped much better with the CNB lowering its benchmark rate to 0.25% from 1% against expectations for a 50 bp cut.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The TPLEX endured an erratic session as participants digested a less-dire-than-expected NFP print – albeit still a record slump – as well as another push towards NIRP. The T-Note had been modestly firming overnight before it legged lower on the release of the NFP report, amid a wider risk on environment. However, the losses in the TPLEX soon reversed course not long after the cash equity open, led by another rally in short rates, which saw shorter maturity Fed Funds futures move above par, seeing the 2-year yield print a new all-time low of 10.5bps. The sharp move lower pared heading into the latest NY Fed USTs purchases schedule announcement, which saw the Fed taper its daily purchases to around USD 7bln per day from around USD 8bln. Looking at the changes within the buckets, it kept its long-end purchases unchanged (20- to 30-year) but made the largest proportion of cuts at the front-end – perhaps to counter the recent leg lower in front-end yields towards NIRP as well as addressing recent steepening post the Treasury quarterly refunding announcement. Following the updated schedule release, yields continued to edge higher, to which by settlement, all yields along the curve had risen on the session: 2s +2.5bps at 0.15%, 5s +3bps at 0.33%, 10s +5bps at 0.68%, 30s +7bps at 1.39%.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong>&nbsp;Fed Funds futures made further forays above par on Friday, with the November contract joining the December one above par. There was no Fedspeak on Friday, but we will be looking closely at remarks from officials in the days ahead (particularly Kashkari and Powell, the latter speaks next week). Powell has previously said the FFR had hit its effective lower bound here at the zero lower bound, but as short rates continue to push into NIRP – some have highlighted the recent ramp-up of options activity around par value Eurodollar strikes and the Fed Funds futures curve falling further – the Fed will likely need to take a firmer foot to tame the market, analysts suggest. Elsewhere, White House Economic Advisor Hassett said today that if the Fed decided to push interest rates negative, he would be supportive of it, but noted he respects the Fed’s independence and would not want to advise it – perhaps an indication of some willingness for NIRP from Washington, although officials such as Trump and Mnuchin have previously expressed aversion.</p>",

The gains appeared to be taking their cues from renewed risk appetite, as seen in the equity complex, in lack of significant updates on the energy front. However, some had attributed late-session gains to reports that PEMEX’s trading arm, PMI, had declared a partial force majeure on fuel cargoes and has also deferred other until the second half of the year. The latest US Baker Hughes rig count saw oil rigs cut by 36 to 338, nat gas rigs cut by 1 to 80 (leaving total rigs down 34 at 374). EOG Resources, a large player in US shale, was the latest to announce further capex cuts in its earnings report, as well as noting that it had significantly cut back its operating rigs. Oil bulls will want to start seeing the reduction in oil drilling activity begin feeding through into storage draws, particularly as US inventories continue to print chunky builds – something which could come back to bite June WTI futures which are due to expire May 19th.</li></ul>",

Therefore, further tapering will likely become more of a debate/concern for policymakers and has thus raised the likelihood that it may not taper any further this week.</li><li>Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe the two most likely scenarios are either a lowering to USD 30bln per week, or to be maintained at USD 40bln per week; if the former, the bank expects a steepening of the curve amid the supply/demand dynamic becoming “unfavourable”, while the latter would see little reaction.</li><li>Note that running into the announcement, the Fed Funds futures have been further moving above par, bringing the rest of the Treasury curve lower with it as NIRP expectations amplify; therefore, an announcement of further tapering has the potential limit the bullish spirits currently seen across the rates market, for the time being, analysts said.</li></ul>",

Unemployment rose to 13% from 7.8%, beating expectations for a rise to 18%; Capital Economics suggests this is a result of those who had lost jobs not yet looking for re-employment, therefore not meeting data criteria. If they were counted, the unemployment rate would have been 17.8%. The report fared better than expected, although overall still a grim situation. CapEco highlights that with some provinces starting to re-open, the worst for employment seems to be behind us. The consultancy points out that StatsCan noted there 5.5mln people were either not employed or working substantially reduced hours; ~25% of February’s employment.</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: NFP, GCC, Central Bank policy and COVID-19 acrimony",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar continues its recovery from or rather stabilisation off recent lows, albeit with the <strong>DXY </strong>unable to maintain momentum above 100.000 amidst a broadly risk positive end to the week and with Fed Fund Futures tipping over the same level from the Dec20 contract to imply negative rates by the end of the year. The Buck has largely dismissed bad data (NFP for example) and mostly bleak survey-based indicators (like regional Fed findings, PMIs and ISMs) on the basis that measures implemented to try and contain the spread of nCoV have effectively shut down the economy beyond essential output and spending on necessities, with worse to come as Q2/2020 unfolds and many other nations facing similar pandemic-related repercussions. On that note, the Greenback has derived impetus from the plight of other currencies, but topped out after a brief breach of a Fib retracement level (99.930) within a 100.400-99.239 weekly range.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all on track to end Friday’s EU session close to best levels of the week vs their US counterpart, and aside from a broad recovery in risk sentiment several specific or independent factors have impacted. NZ recorded zero new cases of coronavirus and is on the verge of lifting lockdown ahead of next week’s RBNZ policy meeting, while Australian retail sales and trade data were supportive either side of the RBA that struck a balance between ensuring stimulus is maintained and fine-tuning QE in accordance with financial market conditions. Elsewhere, some much needed stability in crude markets and a net rebound in oil prices underpinned the Cad to the extent that 2 mn job losses and more contractionary Ivey PMIs have been taken in stride.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>A solid end to the week for the Pound on all counts, but this does not begin to tell the full story as Cable has been extremely whippy between 1.2503-1.2267 parameters and Eur/Gbp from just under 0.8700 to a similar margin above 0.8800. In short, Sterling seems to have been subject to so called ‘seasonal’ weakness, while paying some heed to the remaining dire UK PMIs, keeping a close vigil on domestic virus developments and a dovish BoE super Thursday on balance. To recap, 2 MPC members dissented for a Gbp 100 bn increase in the APF and Governor Bailey said after the event that the Bank may yet decide to lift bond purchases in June. Meanwhile, the Euro had other bearish issues to deal with and namely Germany’s Constitutional Court ruling that the lack of proportionality in the ECB’s PSPP contravenes national law and the EU Treaty principles. However, the retort from GC members including President Lagarde has been resolute in that the policy is within mandate and backed by the ECJ with the express aim of reaching the inflation mandate and making sure that transmission extends to all parts of the Eurozone economy and areas of the bloc. Elsewhere, the Franc has finally acknowledged (to a degree) the strenuous efforts expended by the SNB to curb its strength, but it took reserves data to ram the message home after consecutive weeks of marked increases in Swiss bank sight deposit balances, with a little help from deeper CPI deflation.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Volatile trade for the Norwegian and Swedish Kronas, but ultimately a resumption of their partly technical and also fundamental bull trends as the former was only fleetingly derailed by an unexpected Norges Bank rate cut to zero that was supplemented by extended F-loans. However, the updated depo path signalled 0% for the forecast horizon and although Governor Olsen did not rule out NIRP he chimed with the projection indicating no further easing after the 25 bp reduction. Similarly, last week’s hawkish Riksbank hold kept the Sek on an upward trajectory, albeit with a weak Eur compounding, even though PMIs and data were disappointing. On the EM front, a week of contrasting fortunes, but roughly divided and driven by related oil and commodity price movements as the Rub, Mxn and Zar mainly outperformed peers and the Usd, but the Try suffered more angst to plumb new all time lows before paring some losses after the Turkish banking authority issued bans against trading FX to 3 foreign banks. Last, but by no means least the Yuan was hit by concerns about US-China relations after President Trump heighted his vitriol over the cause of COVID-19 and threatened more tariffs in retaliation, but regrouped after reports that top trade officials from both countries had a greed to talk about Phase 1 and the conversation was said to have been ‘constructive’.&nbsp; However, the Brl also plunged to a fresh record trough after the BCB eased by more than expected (Selic down 75 bp vs -½ point consensus) hot on the heels of Fitch downgrading Brazil’s outlook to negative, in contrast to the Czk that coped much better with the CNB lowering its benchmark rate to 0.25% from 1% against expectations for a 50 bp cut.</p>",

Trump has blamed China for playing down the scale and risks of the virus – a move believed to be correlated to the US Presidential Election.</li><li><strong>CHINA</strong>: China has blamed US officials for attempting to shift their “poor handling” of the pandemic. Analysts via SCMP noted that China can retaliate by dumping its US Treasury holdings whilst imposing tariffs of their own, albeit Chinese officials yesterday noted that tariffs should not be used as a weapon. Meanwhile, underlying soured sentiment remains on the Hong Kong front – Chinese Foreign Ministry said it opposes US interference on China's affairs with Hong Kong.</li></ul><p><strong>TRADE DATA:</strong> The Chinese trade data released overnight for April printed a substantially larger than the expected surplus in CNY and USD terms as the nation resurfaces from lockdown.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO SNAPSHOT</strong>: Sentiment has been supported after US/China officials held a call on trade, amid rising tensions between the two nations; both sides agreed to improve the atmosphere for implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal, and the US said both sides expected obligations to be met. The news allowed ES futures to overnight break through 2900, though the rally peaked out at around 2923, short of the 2932-34 key region technicians had identified. Some support was seen post NFP as it is being framed as “better than feared”, although still a grim headline number of -20.5mln. Treasuries are bear-flattening, though 2s10s remains steeper than before the Treasury’s bumper quarterly refunding this week; 10-year yields are up on the day above the 0.60-0.65bps range, it had forayed above this range in the wake of the refunding announcement. The dollar is flat, as is gold after a prior day of solid gains as real rates took a hit. High-beta FX is higher, however, and major EMFX is mixed/stronger. Oil is higher. Liquidity in Europe is thinner with the UK out for a market holiday.</p><p><strong>SECTORS</strong>: All sectors trade in positive territory; Energy leads the gains, as it is benefits from higher crude oil prices. Financials are higher, likely seeing upside as yields rise after the US jobs report. Analysts are keeping a watchful eye on finance names amid increased focus on negative rates after US Fed Funds futures for maturities around the end of the year rose above par. Industrials also performing well. Technology, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary are the laggards today, albeit still slightly firmer on the day.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Ford (F) announced it is aiming to begin its phased restart in North America from May 18th; it was also downgraded to junk at Fitch. Walt Disney Company (DIS) announced it is to reopen its Disney Springs in the US in a phased manner from May 20th; it also sold out of all its Shanghai reopening Disneyland tickets. Microsoft (MSFT) reported that Amazon (AMZN) has filed another protest of its USD 10bln JEDI contract with the Department of Defense, although the complaint is confidential therefore MSFT is unaware of the details. JPMorgan (JPM) in a 10Q filing restated its NII guidance (revised higher) and cut its expense guidance; it now sees FY20 NII to be around USD 56bln, and adjusted expenses sub USD 65bln in FY20; Q2 NII view at around USD 14bln. Tesla (TSLA) plans to reopen its Fremont, California factory is reportedly reopening today, according to an email.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Uber (UBER) missed on EPS, while revenue and MAU’s were in line with expectations, gross bookings beat. Microchip (MCHP) beat on EPS while revenue was inline, however guidance was weaker than expected. TripAdvisor (TRIP) missed on EPS and revenue while it expects to see a significantly negative EBITDA in Q2. Booking Holdings (BKNG) saw a large EPS miss, although revenues were slightly firmer than expected.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE US RATES:</strong> Fed Funds for the end of the year are still pricing modest negative US rates – this theme helped the equity complex on Thursday, and we will be paying close attention to Fed officials remarks on the theme (a recap of their positions can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/summary-negative-rates-recent-remarks-from-fed-officials-trump-administration-others-07-05-2020\">here</a>), particularly remarks from voter and dove Neel Kashkari, who has previously leaned back against the tool, but said he’d never rule it out, and never say never.</p><p><strong>CORRELATION BUBBLE: </strong>Nomura’s quant desk notes that while the rally in equities continues, it expects some of the upward momentum in S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures to cool; its analysts will be paying attention particularly to Friday events and next week’s slate. But it also says that, given the present market tone, it may be that technical analysis based forecasts are a poor predictor of what will happen next, particularly in the absence of unexpected negative catalysts. “Even in the event of a downward adjustment, we think investors should be prepared for the possibility that a shallow dip is all the market will see.” Nomura says it is important to understand why equities are performing well. “Beyond investors’ high hopes for the resumption of economic activity, one could point to a ‘buy everything’ push that is gaining traction in cross-asset markets; this latter development is registering as a renewed rise in cross-asset correlation of the sort observed during the ‘sell everything’ risk-off phase in February and March, but this time around, however, the elevated cross-asset correlation signifies a ‘buy everything’ mood instead.” Nomura thinks that falling bond yields are making equities look attractively priced in comparison. “Historically, cross-asset correlation has been linked to the monetary policy actions of central banks in developed markets, and the massive monetary easing being undertaken at the moment is having the effect of pouring fuel on the fire of a ‘correlation bubble’ as investors rush to ‘buy everything’,” the bank writes. These risks of correlation bubble appear consistent with persistently low long-term global rates, and the durability of speculative investors’ preference for long positions in bonds. “Our estimates of the net exposure of hedge funds in the aggregate to developed-market government bonds show that global macro hedge funds and relative value funds in particular are leaning long again, and reports to the effect that the US is on its way to adopting NIRP could make bond market participants even more strongly inclined towards long positions, which in turn could spell a decline in long-term rates beyond what technical patterns can explain.”</p><p><strong>FED BOND BUYING ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Fed will update its schedule for next week at 1400 ET/1900 BST; the Fed has been scaling-back its average daily purchase amount, and is currently running at a pace of USD 8bln per day, on average. It will be interesting to see how it tweaks purchases as Fed funds futures imply negative rates. In recent weeks, the announcements have tended to come amid thin trading conditions, and has resulted in some choppy price action (some suggest more Fed bonds purchases are seen as supportive for equities). See here for the details.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>JOB LOSSES:</strong> A record number of Americans lost their jobs in April, the BLS Employment Situation Report noted, with -20.5mln reported (expected -22mln); Cumulatively, the job losses during the COVID fallout now stands at 21.4mln.</li><li><strong>UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RECORD: t</strong>he jobless rate spiked to 14.7% (biggest rise in history) to a new record high, which was slightly better than the 16.0% the street had modelled; it might have been 5ppts higher if not for the mislabelling of those ‘absent from work for other reasons’, Oxford Economics said. Meanwhile, the U6 ‘underemployment rate’ jumped to 22.8% from 8.7%; and labour force participation rate fell dramatically, down 2.5ppts to 60.2%, the lowest since January 1973.</li><li><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Average hourly earnings surged to the highest monthly rate ever (+4.8% M/M and 7.9% Y/Y); “This should not serve as any consolation as it reflects a large composition effect with low-wage sectors suffering massive job losses,” Oxford Economics argues, “average weekly hours rose 0.3%, but the aggregate weekly hours index plunged, while aggregate weekly payrolls plummeted.”</li><li><strong>IMPLICATIONS:</strong> The report should serve as evidence that the significant damage inflicted to communities throughout the country by the 'Great Coronavirus recession', OxEco says, and it anticipates that the severe income loss, elevated precautionary savings and lingering virus fear will curtail consumer demand well past the lockdowns. “Going forward, the interplay of partial rehiring by small businesses in the wake of the Paycheck Protection Program and lingering economic damage means the labour market may be difficult to read,” adding that, “still, while we expect some jobs will be recovered over the coming months, we anticipate an unemployment rate well above 10% by year-end.”</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>The German Constitutional Court did not find the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) in violation of the prohibition on monetary financing but ruled that the programme did not respect the “principle of proportionality”, suggesting it went too far with the mandate – thus violating German law. The “proportionality” in question refers to the effect of the monetary policy objectives of the PSPP to economic and fiscal policy; specifically, the unconditional pursuit of inflation close to but below 2% while ignoring subsequent arising policy effects. As such, the court issued a three-month ultimatum to the ECB to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank \"may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue\".</strong></li><li>Furthermore, the condition states “[The] Bundesbank must ensure that the bonds already purchased and held in its portfolio are sold based on a – possibly long-term – strategy coordinated with the Eurosystem”. That being said, today’s decision does not concern the recently introduced Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), or any measures relating explicitly to COVID-19. The European Commission responded by stating that European top court (ECJ) rulings are binding for all national courts; and added EU law has primacy over national laws.</li><li>The ECB Governing Council took note of the ruling but reiterated its pledge to being fully committed to do everything necessary within its mandate, adding the ECJ ruled in its favour in 2018 that it is acting within its price stability mandate.</li><li>Desks note that a response from the ECB is likely to arise sooner rather than later given the pandemic situations and the need to subside uncertainty. &nbsp;However, some participants noted that the border between monetary policy and economic implications cannot be defined, potentially leaving the door for the GCC to decide on the border on its own. Furthermore, the ECB’s pledge to “do whatever it takes” may be hindered by the conditions attached to the ruling. Pantheon Macro notes that as far as they understand it, the ECJ will have the final say on the matter and ultimately it will \"all blow over\". However, the court ruling certainly raises concerns over the ECB's more recent initiatives which are even more creative than the one ruled on today.</li><li>Focus ahead is now on the ECB’s response and how they intend to clarify the issue, as well as from a technical perspective whether the GCC would then need to issue a subsequent ruling to this; additionally, some have posited that in theory, another member’s Central Bank could effectively take over from the Bundesbank and purchase the German PSPP – albeit this is complicated. Some fear that the ruling could open the door to similar cases in countries that are just as inclined, thus further threatening European unity.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><i><strong>NOTE: </strong>The April jobs report is already stale, given the timelier weekly initial jobless claims data, and the market reaction is expected to be muted; accordingly, we are publishing this briefing as a 'primer', rather than 'preview'.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>SUMMARY: </strong>April’s Employment Situation Report is expected to be grim, and will be the largest monthly fall ever seen, eclipsing the -1.959mln seen in September 1945. The jobless rate is seen spiking to 16.0% from 4.4%, although the ‘actual’ number could be even higher than that; claims data signal a rate around 23.0%, although given the CARES Act widening eligibility for unemployment support, the official number may be below that. This is a situation we already know, and to a large extent, has been priced in by the market. The timelier weekly jobless claims data is garnering much more attention, and the April jobs report is already out of date. The attention is now on how quickly the economy ‘recovers’ and ‘normalises’ – many of the laid off workers will be asked to return, meaning that the situation will improve in the months ahead; however, policymakers have been keen to impress any improvement will likely be slow. Trading the jobs report is also likely to be tricky; analysts note that with the consensus so large, and the underlying message already acknowledged by the market, even if the consensus was missed by +/- 5mln, it might not make too much of a difference.</p><p><strong>EXPECTATIONS (APR):</strong></p><ul><li>Nonfarm Payrolls: (Exp. -22mln, range -35mln to -1mln; prev. -701k)</li><li>Unemployment rate: (Exp. 16.0, range 10.0% to 22.0%; Prev. 4.4%)</li><li>U6 unemployment rate: (Prev. 8.7%)</li><li>Participation rate: (Prev. 62.7%)</li><li>Private payrolls: (Exp. -21.05mln; prev. -713k)</li><li>Manufacturing payrolls: (Exp. -2.5mln; Prev. -18k)</li><li>Government payrolls: (Prev. +12k)</li><li>Average earnings M/M: (Exp. +0.4%; Prev. +0.4%)</li><li>Average earnings Y/Y: (Exp. +3.3%; Prev. +3.1%)</li><li>Average workweek hours: (Exp. 33.7hrs; Prev. 34.2hrs)</li></ul><p><strong>INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> Initial jobless claims data that corresponds with the BLS employment situation report survey period printed 4.43mln claims (analysts had expected somewhere between 3.0-5.5mln), taking the cumulative tally at that point to 26.45mln. It was, however, the third consecutive lower reading. In terms of the implications for the April employment situation report, Pantheon Macroeconomics said that data was consistent with around 21mln jobs being shed in the month, and looking ahead, May payrolls are seen declining by 9mln, while Pantheon believes that the June report will largely depend on how far states are able to re-open their economies, especially in the discretionary consumer services sector, where most of the first wave of jobs disappeared after the lockdowns.</p><p><strong>ADP: </strong>ADP reported 20.236mln jobs were shed from the US economy in April, close to the consensus view looking for -20mln. It is difficult to read too much into the data, given much of the gloom had been signalled by other metrics in advance, and as such, the data merely confirms what the market was already discounting (hence the muted reaction in asset prices). Capital Economics notes that job losses came predominantly in the services sector, though health care was hit too. CapEco points out that the ADP counts anyone on the active payroll rather than just people who were paid during the month, which is the official non-farm payroll definition, and with many folks temporarily laid off, that could have created a discrepancy, with those people still on the active payroll, but not counted in the official non-farm payroll figures and also qualifying as unemployed in the other official household survey. The takeaway, Capital Economics says, is that the official BLS print on Friday might look even worse than the ADP report implies.</p><p><strong>SURVEY DATA:</strong> In the manufacturing ISM report, the Employment Index registered 27.5 falling 16.3 points vs March, the ninth straight month that the sub index was in contraction. It was the Employment Index's lowest reading since June 1949, and largest one-month decrease since numeric records began in 1948 (similar was seen in Markit’s manufacturing report). All six big industry sectors experienced employment contraction as a result of furloughs and layoffs due to a lack of new orders and/or social-distancing mandates, ISM said. In the non-manufacturing ISM survey, the Employment sub-index decreased to 30.0, a 17 point fall; it was the second month that the sub-index was in contraction. All 18 industries reported decreased employment. Comments from respondents include: \"Furloughs from COVID-19\" and \"Employees flexing schedules and furloughed due to a decrease in volume,\" the report noted.</p><p><strong>CHALLENGER JOB CUTS:</strong> Challenger reported 671,129 layoffs in April, rising from the prior 222,288. It was the highest single month total on record. So far this year, 1,017,812 job cuts have been announced (vs 230,433 announced in the first four months of 2019). “No doubt employers have every intention of bringing back workers once the immediate crisis passes, but the indefinite nature of this pandemic coupled with the fact that we’re seeing recession - or even depression-level economic data means the vast majority of these jobs will not return any time soon,” Challenger said, adding that “the longer people are out of work, the less money they have to spend. The longer people feel unsafe going out and spending, the less likely many small and midsize businesses will keep people on the payroll.”</p><p><strong>CONSUMERS:</strong> Within the Conference Board’s April consumer confidence report, the differential between jobs plentiful and hard to get – which economists note tends to be correlated with the BLS unemployment rate – fell to 13.6 from 29.5, suggesting that we are in store for a steep rise in the jobless rate (consensus looks for unemployment to spike to 16% from 4.4%). Consumers’ outlook was mixed, the report said, with those expecting more jobs ahead rising from 16.9 to 41.0, while those anticipating fewer jobs also increased from 17.6 to 20.8. And consumers do not appear to be confident about their income prospects in the months ahead: the percentage of consumers expecting an increase declined from 20.0 to 16.7, while the proportion expecting a decrease rose from 10.1 to 18.5.</p><p><strong>TRADING THE NFP:</strong> Treasury response will likely be limited, even if the actual headline figure deviates from the consensus by a few million, BMO says. The economic data has been so bad that the sticker shock itself takes the downside out of context. \"The differing implications of a -22mln print and a -27mln print at this point is nearly impossible for the market to know. What will remain more pivotal is how quickly those jobs are recovered, and how many are lost permanently.\"</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO SNAPSHOT: </strong>Sentiment has been supported after US/China officials held a call on trade, amid rising tensions between the two nations; both sides agreed to improve the atmosphere for implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal, and the US said both sides expected obligations to be met. The news allowed ES futures to overnight break through 2900, though the rally peaked out at around 2923, short of the 2932-34 key region technicians had identified. Treasuries are bull-flattening, though 2s10s remains steeper than before the Treasury’s bumper quarterly refunding this week; 10-year yields are back into the 60-65% range, having forayed above it in the wake of the refunding announcement. The dollar is flat ahead of payrolls, while gold is adding to recent gains booked after real rates took a hit. High-beta FX is higher, however, and major EMFX is mixed/stronger. Oil is higher. Liquidity in Europe is thinner with the UK out for a market holiday.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE US RATES: </strong>Fed Funds for the end of the year are still pricing modest negative US rates – this theme helped the equity complex on Thursday, and we will be paying close attention to Fed officials remarks on the theme (a recap of their positions can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/summary-negative-rates-recent-remarks-from-fed-officials-trump-administration-others-07-05-2020\">here</a>), particularly remarks from voter and dove Neel Kashkari, who has previously leaned back against the tool, but said he’d never rule it out, and never say never.</p><p><strong>CORRELATION BUBBLE:</strong> Nomura’s quant desk notes that while the rally in equities continues, it expects some of the upward momentum in S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures to cool; its analysts will be paying attention particularly to Friday events and next week’s slate. But it also says that, given the present market tone, it may be that technical analysis based forecasts are a poor predictor of what will happen next, particularly in the absence of unexpected negative catalysts. “Even in the event of a downward adjustment, we think investors should be prepared for the possibility that a shallow dip is all the market will see.” Nomura says it is important to understand why equities are performing well. “Beyond investors’ high hopes for the resumption of economic activity, one could point to a ‘buy everything’ push that is gaining traction in cross-asset markets; this latter development is registering as a renewed rise in cross-asset correlation of the sort observed during the ‘sell everything’ risk-off phase in February and March, but this time around, however, the elevated cross-asset correlation signifies a ‘buy everything’ mood instead.” Nomura thinks that falling bond yields are making equities look attractively priced in comparison. “Historically, cross-asset correlation has been linked to the monetary policy actions of central banks in developed markets, and the massive monetary easing being undertaken at the moment is having the effect of pouring fuel on the fire of a ‘correlation bubble’ as investors rush to ‘buy everything’,” the bank writes. These risks of correlation bubble appear consistent with persistently low long-term global rates, and the durability of speculative investors’ preference for long positions in bonds. “Our estimates of the net exposure of hedge funds in the aggregate to developed-market government bonds show that global macro hedge funds and relative value funds in particular are leaning long again, and reports to the effect that the US is on its way to adopting NIRP could make bond market participants even more strongly inclined towards long positions, which in turn could spell a decline in long-term rates beyond what technical patterns can explain.”</p><p><strong>PAYROLLS AHEAD:</strong> April’s Employment Situation Report is expected to be grim - exp. -22mln - and will be the largest monthly fall ever seen, eclipsing the -1.959mln seen in September 1945. The jobless rate is seen spiking to 16.0% from 4.4%, although the ‘actual’ number could be even higher than that; claims data signal a rate around 23.0%, although given the CARES Act widening eligibility for unemployment support, the official number may be below that. This is a situation we already know, and to a large extent, has been priced in by the market. The timelier weekly jobless claims data is garnering much more attention, and the April jobs report is already out of date. The attention is now on how quickly the economy ‘recovers’ and ‘normalises’ – many of the laid-off workers will be asked to return, meaning that the situation will improve in the months ahead; however, policymakers have been keen to impress any improvement will likely be slow. Trading the jobs report is also likely to be tricky; analysts note that with the consensus so large, and the underlying message already acknowledged by the market, even if the consensus was missed by +/- 5mln, it might not make too much of a difference.

It will be interesting to see how it tweaks purchases as Fed funds futures imply negative rates. In recent weeks, the announcements have tended to come amid thin trading conditions, and has resulted in some choppy price action (some suggest more Fed bonds purchases are seen as supportive for equities).

Perhaps the more pronounced rebound at the Eurozone margins amidst that the EU is contemplating a 10 year ESM credit line has boosted BTPs and Bonos to the relative detriment of the German benchmark or merely the prospect of ECB President Lagarde launching another defence of QE and apply more pressure on the Eurogroup to resolve fiscal differences and deliver a joint rescue fund. However, Italian debt may stall/reverse ahead of Moody’s ratings review after hours. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain firm and the curve flatter again before the aforementioned jobs data and with FFFs from end 2020 still implying sub-zero rates.</p>",

Nerves ahead of the monthly US jobs data may be weighing on the Buck alongside buoyant risk sentiment after a seemingly constructive call between the US and China on the Phase 1 trade deal that is keeping the <strong>YUAN</strong> off recent lows and offsetting some COVID-19 economic headwinds. However, the looming payrolls number and unemployment rate are widely expected to highlight the adverse impact of measures taken to mitigate the fallout, while markets are starting to price in or hedge for even lower short term rates in response to even worse contagion from the pandemic in the months to come and this is also weighing on the Dollar.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is flying high again, and back on the 0.6100 handle awaiting lift-off from lockdown, but also benefiting from favourable cross-flows as the Aussie reflects on the latest RBA SOMP that essentially repeated the policy meeting assessment and guidance, though also reiterated that QE can be scaled up again if necessary. Aud/Usd is holding above 0.6500 after fading into 0.6550, while Aud/Nzd has pulled back under 1.0650 from around 1.0686 awaiting next week’s RBNZ policy convene and Aussie labour market report.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Not quite zero to hero, but the early signs are looking considerably better for Sterling after a far from super Thursday, with Cable retesting 1.2400 compared to deep sub-1.2300 levels yesterday and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.8750 on UK May/VE Bank holiday. No specific or new catalyst for the Pound’s rebound, so the recovery looks more technical and positional ahead of the weekend and Sunday’s update from PM Johnson on plans to remove coronavirus restrictions.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All firmer against the Greenback, as the Loonie extends well beyond 1.4000 to 1.3925 in the run up to Canadian and US jobs data, the Franc pares losses towards 0.9700 and Euro forms a firmer base above 1.0800 following its fall to a fresh multi-week trough. However, the single currency looks somewhat hampered by hefty option expiry interest at 1.0850 (1.9 bn) having attempted a breach earlier.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The G10 laggard, albeit marginally, with the Yen boxed in from 106.23-46 vs its US peer in wake of 2 efforts to clear 106.00, but no success before the return of Japanese participants from Golden Week.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>A positive start to Friday’s session across the board, as firmer oil prices and the aforementioned risk-supportive backdrop keeps the Scandinavian Krona’s in bullish mode, while the Turkish Lira claws back more losses from record lows and SA Rand retains its position as best or most improved EM.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX was heavily bid on Thursday, reversing all of the losses incurred after Wednesday’s bazooka refunding announcement. The short-end was particularly sought, where Fed Funds futures began pricing US negative rates in December out. By settlement, 2s -5bps at 0.13%, 5s -8bps at 0.30%, 10s 9bps at 0.63%, 30s -10bps at 1.31%. The grind lower in yields got going as the US session got underway, having risen in APAC and early European trade. There was no new/immediate catalyst for the strength, although desks note the likelihood of participants seizing the rate back-up from Wednesday in anticipation that the Fed would not let the UST curve continue to steepen. Tomorrow’s weekly Fed purchases schedule will be key for gauging the Fed’s tolerance for curve steepening, where it has up to now been tapering its weekly purchases, albeit at a declining rate each week; Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe the two most likely scenarios are either a lowering to USD 30bln per week, or to be maintained at USD 40bln per week, which if the former, the bank expects a steepening of the curve amid the supply/demand dynamic becoming “unfavourable”, while the latter would see little reaction. The TPLEX also continued to rally in the face of record corporate issuance – IFR noted this week marked the third largest for supply ever – where over ten IG issuers came to the dollar market today, including CVX, which is still to announce the size and pricing of its announced seven-parter. US T-note futures (M0) settled 24 ticks higher at 139-09+.</p><p>Fed's total balance sheet size rose to USD 6.77tln from USD 6.70tln W/W and Treasury holdings increased to USD 4.02tln from USD 3.97tln W/W, while central bank liquidity swaps rose to USD 444.90bln from USD 438.95bln W/W. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Harker (voter, hawk)</strong> said there could be robust growth in H2 if the US economy reopens in June and that banks should not issue large dividends at the moment, while he sees brutally painful Q2 and noted that factories could bounce back but damage to travel and hospitality could be long. Fed's Harker also stated that negative interest rates would not have an effect on the economy in this crisis and evidence on effectiveness of negative rates globally is mixed, while he suggested he has a high hurdle for it. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (non-voter, hawk)</strong> said the US is probably \"right at\" the trough of the economic downturn and the economy went sharply lower but will gradually go up. Furthermore, Barkin added that negative rates have been tried in other places and there is nothing to make him think they are \"worth a try\" in the US. (Newswires)</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.2%) are positive as they take impetus from their Wall St peers and with risk appetite spurred by loosening of coronavirus-related restrictions after Australia’s cabinet agreed to relax some of its social distancing measures in a 3-step phase and with Japan touting the early lifting of the state of emergency in some regions, while Japan is also said to mull additional measures including proposal to subsidize rents for small businesses for up to 6 months. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) join in on the upbeat tone amid the easing of trade tensions following a conference call between USTR Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and China Vice Premier Liu He in which the sides agreed to work together to create a beneficial environment for carrying out the trade deal and to strengthen cooperation on the macro economy, as well as public health.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is subdued below the 100.00 level after Fed Fund Rate futures recently began to price in negative rates in the US by year-end and following another week of larger than expected jobless claims that preceded the looming NFP data which some expect to show a drop of 22mln jobs. The greenback’s major counterparts have benefitted with EUR/USD around the 1.0850 level where there is a large option expiry of EUR 1.9bln set to roll off for today’s New York cut, and it was also reported that the EU Commission is to make it less stringent for using ESM funds in which it will not require a macro-adjustment programme, while GBP/USD extends on its gains and briefly tested the 1.2400 level to the upside despite the UK bank holiday and recent BoE forecast for a near-30% economic contraction in H1. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses are underpinned by the heightened risk appetite and antipodean benefit due to their high-beta statuses, with AUD/USD also helped by a firmer PBoC reference rate setting and after the RBA Statement on Monetary Policy which stated the RBA is prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary to achieve yield target but noted market functioning has improved and the central bank bond purchases and market operations have been scaled back accordingly.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track upside in T-notes as US yields declined amid the pricing of future negative rates, but with price action in JGBs relatively tepid as participants look ahead to the 10yr inflation indexed bond auction.</p>",
