There were a couple of subtle changes to the statement; the FOMC's view of household spending activity was downgraded to \"moderate\" from \"strong pace\" -- perhaps a little stronger than some were expected (some had expected 'solid'), while its view on inflation is now that it is \"returning to\" target (from \"near\" target). On overnight and term repo operations, it said that it would continue operations through April, when corporate tax season might cause funding pressure. Additionally, it said it would be continuing to buy T-Bills through Q2. Money market pricing of the Fed's rate trajectory is unchanged for 2020, with about 33bps of easing priced (note: the FOMC has forecast no changes to the FFR rate this year)</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE:</strong> For the most part, the press conference was in line with expectations. Most of the interesting remarks were around the balance sheet, where Powell emphasised the Fed was growing it to ensure bank reserves were ample, a level which it believes it would hit in Q2; further, he suggests a level of USD 1.5trln (where it stood at end-2019) would serve as a floor, but there is no fixed level the Fed has set, the level was dynamic. Powell said that the Fed would know when adjustments to the balance sheet have run its course when reserves were durably at a sustainable level. On inflation, Powell said the Fed tweaked its view within the statement to demonstrate that the Fed was not happy with missing its inflation target -- some Fedwatchers said that this opened the door to looser policy ahead, while other watchers noted that Powell was highlighting that purchases will be reduced as the appropriate level of the balance sheet is reached, potentially hinting at less accommodative conditions ahead. Powell generally retained his upbeat view of the US economy, noting that financial conditions were supportive, trade tensions had eased, though were yet to go away, and the risks of a hard Brexit had diminished; citing PMI data, Powell said he believes that manufacturing may have bottomed, but noted that nothing was assured. Indeed, the Fed Chair noted the macroeconomic uncertainties presented by the Coronavirus, which he said were at an early stage. In aggregate, he stated he was \"cautiously optimistic\". Net/net, over the press conference, T-Notes firmed slightly (10y yields down around 2bps), the DXY eased back to 98.0, XAU added around 5 bucks to 1575; ES futures saw some modest downside, during the latter part of the presser; there have been concerns from some policymakers about the growing balance sheet, and Powell said asset prices were “somewhat elevated”; on the face of it, this would suggest that the Fed might not be so inclined to boost the balance sheet while asset prices are \"elevated\", some have argued, which may explain the neg ticks in ES.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS:</strong> Today's newsflow focussed on airlines cancelling flights to and from China, amid the outbreak, while the tally of cases ticks up, with nearly 6,000 reported. For traders, the key development was comments out of China, here a government economist said China Q1 growth could fall below 5% due to the virus, based on the assumption that the outbreak will peak by mid-February and end by March-end (for reference, China growth printed 6.1% in 2019, and authorities target at least 6% this year; crucially, the economist stated that Beijing was likely to step up policy support for the economy, that could boost the budget deficit to over 3% of GDP this year, while the PBOC might further cut RRRs and rates to provide support. Later, state news Xinhua reported that the government is to study and implement tax and financial support policies to mitigate effects of the coronavirus outbreak. In aggregate, it shows that authorities are willing to step in to cushion any economic downside stemming as a result of the outbreak.</p><p><strong>* BOE PREVIEW:</strong> Following the December policy announcement, where rates were left unchanged at 0.75% along with two dovish dissents, the January meeting has been perceived as increasingly “live” given recent data points and dovish interjections by various MPC members. Consensus for the release looks for rates to be left unchanged at 0.75% with a 6-3 vote split as analysts suggest that, on balance, signs of the UK economy turning a corner and upcoming fiscal support should be enough to convince policymakers to keep their powder dry this time around. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/dow-ceo-says-coronavirus-increasing-demand-for-cleaning-products.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES (DEC):</strong> Pending home sales fell by 4.9% in December M/M, confounding expectations of a 0.5% rise. Pantheon Macroeconomics suggested that the data is hard to explain given the rising trend in mortgage applications, as well as the mild weather in December. \"Our guess is that the reported drop says more about the difficulty of seasonally adjusting the data across the year-end and/or the shortage inventory of homes for sale than it says about the underlying trend,\" and the consultancy expects a clear rebound in January, and then a continuation of the upward trend. \"Mortgage demand continues to strengthen, but if potential buyers cannot find suitable homes, the result will be a meaningful acceleration in home prices, which in turn will feed into rents.\"</p><p><strong>* US ADVANCED GOODS TRADE BALANCE (DEC):</strong> The advanced goods trade deficit widened in December to USD 68.33bln from USD 62.99bln. Exports of goods came in at USD 137.0bln (USD +0.4bln vs November), while imports of goods were USD 205.3bln (USD +5.8bln vs November). Oxford Economics noted that trade picked up in December, as firm domestic demand helped prompt a jump in imports. \"Yet the outlook remains sluggish, with imports down 4.9% Y/Y, and exports up only 0.7% Y/Y,\" adding that despite a phase one US-China deal, \"existing tariffs, easing US demand and slow global growth will keep trade sluggish.\" Meanwhile, OxEco says that the wider-than-expected December trade gap does not change its estimate that real net exports will add 1.3ppts to Q4 real GDP growth (it has forecast at 2.2%), ahead of Thursday's GDP report for Q4. In wake of the data, the Atlanta Fed's GDPnow tracking estimate was lowered to 1.7% from 1.9%.</p><p><strong>* AUS CPI (Q4):</strong> Overall a firm inflation report, with the headline Y/Y and Q/Q both topping forecasts at 1.8% and 0.7% respectively (Exp. 1.7% and 0.6%). The Trimmed Mean measure also beat estimates Y/Y, while the Q/Q and Weighted Mean metrics all met expectations. The rise in inflation was mainly led by an increase in tobacco prices and the drought’s impact on food prices. Westpac suggests that housing data is worth monitoring since it carries a substantial weight in the CPI numbers (around some 22%), and \"as such, any near-term upside risk to housing costs increase the risk inflation could accelerate to the mid-point of the target band.\" Meanwhile, analysts at UBS play down the upside beat in inflation and state that there is no reason for the RBA to upgrade the forecasts. Nonetheless, RBC revised its RBA rate cut forecast to June from Q1 and JPMorgan also pushed back its rate cut call to May from February.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> According to local media, Yemeni Houthi rebels targeted facilities of oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, recently attacking the Jizan facility, and airports of Acha and Jizan, and the Khamis Mushair military base. The Saudis did not comment, though anonymous officials suggested that Saudi Arabia intercepted the missiles. Desks noted that Jazan has no oil production or export infrastructure, so any attack would not impact Saudi oil supply. Geopolitical consultancy Stratfor noted that it marks the first Houthi strike on Saudi Arabia since the group said in September 2019 that it would avoid further attacks after strikes against the Abqaiq and Khurais oil fields. \"If the Houthis are resuming their attacks against Saudi Arabia, it could suggest that Iran has reversed an earlier decision to restrain the group's activities, which could set the stage for additional attacks in the future,\" Stratfor writes.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 0.15 LOWER AT USD 53.33/BBL; BRENT SETTLED USD 0.30 HIGHER AT 59.81/BBL:</strong> Energy markets reversed earlier gains after the weekly EIA inventory data, and wider cooling of risk appetite weighed on the sector. The benchmarks initially were on the front-foot, following a large surprise draw that the API reported on Tuesday, though the official EIA release countered this (particularly in WTI), which showed a 3.5mln bbl build (more than 7x the expected build), although the products came in slightly more on the bullish side of expectations, albeit fractionally and gasoline stocks still building amid a larger dip than expected in refinery utilisation; meanwhile, Cushing stocks built 0.9mln bbls, against the Genscape forecasted draw of a similar magnitude, and crude production remained unchanged at 13.0mln BPD. Note that prior to the EIA release, the crude complex caught a bid after Yemen’s Houthis declared that they had launched drone and rocket strike on Saudi oil facilities, airports and other locations, although the move reversed after reports suggested the attacks had not been accurate, and no serious damage had been caused. Meanwhile on the OPEC front, Algeria’s Energy Minster said it is very possible that the OPEC+ March meeting could be brought forward to February (from March); when asked about extending the deal, the Minister said anything was possible. Elsewhere, Marathon Petroleum (MPC) said on its earnings call that it anticipates a slight narrowing of the WTI-Brent Arb throughout the rest of the year due to the new pipeline takeaway and Gulf Coast export capacity coming online.</p><p>*<strong> CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.09% at 3273, NDX +0.12% at 9102, DJIA +0.04% at 28,734.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) firmer following EPS and Revenue beats and strong iPhone and wearables revenue, whilst noting very solid demand for its iPhone 11 and AirPods. Boeing (BA) despite initially grim metrics, as analysts highlight its decline in operating cash flow, is much less than feared, despite missing estimates, whilst highlighting the “noise” with its other figures due to the 737 MAX. McDonald’s (MCD) saw volatile trade post earnings on decent figures, however it announced it US customer traffic declined, and that it is working on bringing back market share of its US breakfasts. Semiconductors (SOX) index sold off following AMD earnings which provided softer guidance than expected, as was the case with Xilinx (XLNX). AT&amp;T (T) beat on EPS and Revenue, however the stock plunged on its disappointing TV metrics. Starbucks (SBUX) reported top and bottom-line beats, however its guidance was left unchanged and it announced it has shut half of its stores in China, due to the coronavirus. eBay (EBAY) traded in the red on disappointing guidance despite boosting it share repurchase programme by USD 5bln and dividend by 14%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> L Brands (LB) traded with gains of over 13% as reports state it is considering strategic alternatives for its Victoria Secret Brand. Facebook (FB) was upgraded to a Strong Buy from Buy as the analyst expects FB to report Revenue and Earnings beats in Q4. Goldman Sachs (GS) announced a medium-term target (3-year) of more than 13% RoE and more than 14% RoTE; medium term targets include 13-13.5% CET 1 ratio (exp. FY22 12.42%), at its very first analyst day. Beyond Meat (BYND) shares traded higher as KFC (YUM) confirmed it is expanding the company’s plant-based chicken nuggets.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) SETTLED 13 TICKS HIGHER AT 131-00: </strong>Yields were lower across the curve by between 3.5 to 5.5bps, with the belly rallying. Major curve spreads, however, were mixed, with 2s5s, 2s10s, and 2s30s narrowing, while the 5s10s, 5s30sand 10s30s widened slightly. The Fed hiked the IOER but kept its main rate unchanged and extended its purchases through April (See Fed section for details). The complex saw upside as Powell noted that the Coronavirus had the capacity to weigh on China activity, while there were still uncertainties around trade policy.</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> was little changed following the latest FOMC decision which only saw slight tweaks to its language on inflation and housing data. However, during the press conference DXY saw some weakness (but remained firmer above 98.00) as Powell alluded to continued balance sheet expansion, whilst also expressing concerns around inflation, which in turn boosted <strong>XAU.</strong> <strong>CNH</strong> traded flat against the buck as markets take a breather from coronavirus concerns as participants await tomorrows WHO announcement. <strong>EUR</strong> remained within thin ranges flirting around the 1.10 figure against the greenback despite firmer French and German consumer confidence. <strong>GBP</strong> remains around the 1.30 figure ahead of BoE rate decision Thursday. <strong>JPY</strong> flat against the buck as it hovers around 109 awaiting coronavirus developments. <strong>AUD</strong> gradually sold off against the buck despite being firmer overnight following firmer CPI. <strong>NZD</strong> marginally softer ahead of NZ trade data. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally weaker against the buck apart from <strong>MXN</strong>. <strong>USDTRY</strong> hovered around 5.9600 following comments from Turkish President Erdogan criticising Russia’s Syria conduct.</p>",

The tech giant has managed to evolve as key a player in the Cloud sector, a rarity for a legacy tech name, with thanks to its Azure - posting an impressive +57% Q/Q growth rate in Q1 - which has managed to keep the Co competitive with other leaders such as AWS (AMZN) and Google Cloud (GOOGL). Analysts are eager to see if Azure can maintain its strong growth, although last quarter was a particularly high benchmark.</p><p>Several analysts have alluded to their research indicating a strong quarter. Wedbush’s Ives (“Outperform” rating, USD 195 PT) expects the Co to post “solid” beats across the board with continued strength in Azure and Office 365, citing “strong field checks” that suggest potential for a 3-4% beat on commercial cloud expectations. Earlier in January, Morgan Stanley (“Overweight”, USD 189 PT) analysts conducted a transatlantic survey across 100 CIOs which showed Microsoft as the preferred hybrid cloud vender. More generally, analysts are mostly united in their support for the Co and its position for the future. Piper Sandler’s Bracelin (“Overweight”, USD 190) believes it has \"many options to enhance its position as a trusted enabler of the digital enterprise\" beyond Azure, 365, LinkedIn, and GitHub, citing its USD 67bln net cash &amp; investments as powder for potential “needle-moving” acquisitions, which “could take centre stage in 2020.”</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE: For the most part, the press conference was in line with expectations. Most of the interesting remarks were around the balance sheet, where Powell emphasised the Fed was growing it to ensure bank reserves were ample, a level which it believes it would hit in Q2; further, he suggests a level of USD 1.5trln (where it stood at end-2019) would serve as a floor, but there is no fixed level the Fed has set, the level was dynamic. Powell said that the Fed would know when adjustments to the balance sheet have run its course when reserves were durably at a sustainable level. On inflation, Powell said the Fed tweaked its view within the statement to demonstrate that the Fed was not happy with missing its inflation target -- some Fedwatchers said that this opened the door to looser policy ahead, while other watchers noted that Powell was highlighting that purchases will be reduced as the appropriate level of the balance sheet is reached, potentially hinting at less accommodative conditions ahead. Powell generally retained his upbeat view of the US economy, noting that financial conditions were supportive, trade tensions had eased, though were yet to go away, and the risks of a hard Brexit had diminished; citing PMI data, Powell said he believes that manufacturing may have bottomed, but noted that nothing was assured. Indeed, the Fed Chair noted the macroeconomic uncertainties presented by the Coronavirus, which he said were at an early stage. In aggregate, he stated he was \"cautiously optimistic\". Net/net, over the press conference, T-Notes firmed slightly (10y yields down around 2bps), the DXY eased back to 98.0, XAU added around 5 bucks to 1575; ES futures saw some modest downside, during the latter part of the presser; there have been concerns from some policymakers about the growing balance sheet, and Powell said asset prices were “somewhat elevated”; on the face of it, this would suggest that the Fed might not be so inclined to boost the balance sheet while asset prices are \"elevated\", some have argued, which may explain the neg ticks in ES.</p>",

The benchmarks initially were on the front-foot, following a large surprise draw that the API reported on Tuesday, though the official EIA release countered this (particularly in WTI), which showed a 3.5mln bbl build (more than 7x the expected build), although the products came in slightly more on the bullish side of expectations, albeit fractionally and gasoline stocks still building amid a larger dip than expected in refinery utilisation; meanwhile, Cushing stocks built 0.9mln bbls, against the Genscape forecasted draw of a similar magnitude, and crude production remained unchanged at 13.0mln BPD. Note that prior to the EIA release, the crude complex caught a bid after Yemen’s Houthis declared that they had launched drone and rocket strike on Saudi oil facilities, airports and other locations, although the move reversed after reports suggested the attacks had not been accurate, and no serious damage had been caused. Meanwhile on the OPEC front, Algeria’s Energy Minster said it is very possible that the OPEC+ March meeting could be brought forward to February (from March); when asked about extending the deal, the Minister said anything was possible. Elsewhere, Marathon Petroleum (MPC) said on its earnings call that it anticipates a slight narrowing of the WTI-Brent Arb throughout the rest of the year due to the new pipeline takeaway and Gulf Coast export capacity coming online.</p>",

There were a couple of subtle changes to the statement; the FOMC's view of household spending activity was downgraded to \"moderate\" from \"strong pace\" -- perhaps a little stronger than some were expected (some had expected 'solid'), while its view on inflation is now that it is \"returning to\" target (from \"near\" target). On overnight and term repo operations, it said that it would continue operations through April, when corporate tax season might cause funding pressure. Additionally, it said it would be continuing to buy T-Bills through Q2. Money market pricing of the Fed's rate trajectory is unchanged for 2020, with about 33bps of easing priced (note: the FOMC has forecast no changes to the FFR rate this year). Attention now focuses on the Powell press conference at the bottom of the hour, which you can watch via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh6TH7PoS5M\">this link</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index has forged more gains in the run up to the FOMC, albeit in part if not principally on relative weakness elsewhere, and with the exception of only a select few. However, the DXY remains some distance from the next upside technical objective around 98.402 (Fib retracement level from 2019’s high to this year’s low to date) within a 97.926-98.191 range and the Dollar’s near term fate lies with the tone of the Fed’s statement, guidance and Chair Powell’s presser, as today’s US data slate has not provided bulls with any further impetus. Note, a detailed FOMC primer is available via our Research Suite.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD/NOK</strong></p><p>All underperforming their US counterparts and the other G10 currencies, with the Kiwi edging closer to 0.6500 and back towards 1.0350 vs the Greenback and Aussie respectively ahead of NZ trade balances for December and the full year. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd continues to hold up better within a 0.6736-77 band on the back of firmer than expected Q4 inflation data that prompted more defeered RBA rate cut projections. However, the Loonie and Norwegian Crown are losing the prop of higher crude prices after a hefty build in EIA inventories, as Usd/Cad revisits resistance/offers ahead of 1.3200 and Tuesday’s 7 week apex, while Eur/Nok bounces from just under 10.0400 to around 10.0840.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also on the back foot vs the Buck, but the single currency and Sterling are still displaying a degree of resilience around big figures at 1.1000 and 1.3000 respectively, partially for sentimental reasons and also benefiting from some speculative buying on the premise that more technical rather than psychological lows may not be breached, like 1.0981 from late November last year and January 14’s 1.2955 trough). However, Cable could yet be undermined by the BoE, if not the FOMC, if the MPC opts to cut rates tomorrow or clearly signals that an ease is in the offing on the eve of Brexit Day, and the Franc has been hampered by a deterioration in ZEW’s Swiss investor sentiment gauge, with Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9750 and Eur/Chf straddling 1.0725.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad losses vs the Dollar awaiting more news and developments on the China virus front, as the WHO calls an emergency meeting for Thursday to review its initial decision to refrain from labelling the novel corona outbreak as an international health emergency. However, Usd/Cnh is holding between 6.9500-9700, while Usd/Zar retests 200 DMA resistance and Usd/Try hovers just shy of 5.9600 following Turkish President Erdogan’s verbal criticism of Russia’s conduct in Syria.</p>",

The tech giant has managed to evolve as key a player in the Cloud sector, a rarity for a legacy tech name, with thanks to its Azure - posting an impressive +57% Q/Q growth rate in Q1 - which has managed to keep the Co competitive with other leaders such as AWS (AMZN) and Google Cloud (GOOGL). Analysts are eager to see if Azure can maintain its strong growth, although last quarter was a particularly high benchmark.</p><p>Several analysts have alluded to their research indicating a strong quarter. Wedbush’s Ives (“Outperform” rating, USD 195 PT) expects the Co to post “solid” beats across the board with continued strength in Azure and Office 365, citing “strong field checks” that suggest potential for a 3-4% beat on commercial cloud expectations. Earlier in January, Morgan Stanley (“Overweight”, USD 189 PT) analysts conducted a transatlantic survey across 100 CIOs which showed Microsoft as the preferred hybrid cloud vender. More generally, analysts are mostly united in their support for the Co and its position for the future. Piper Sandler’s Bracelin (“Overweight”, USD 190) believes it has \"many options to enhance its position as a trusted enabler of the digital enterprise\" beyond Azure, 365, LinkedIn, and GitHub, citing its USD 67bln net cash &amp; investments as powder for potential “needle-moving” acquisitions, which “could take centre stage in 2020.”</p>",

Conversely, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.8%)</strong> suffered a bloodbath on return from the Lunar New Year holiday and briefly slipped into correction territory with heavy losses across a broad range of industries including financials, airliners and retailers due to the coronavirus fears which prompted measures from Hong Kong to reduce cross-border travel with mainland China, while casino stocks were also a losing bet after China stopped issuing individual travel visas for visits to Macau by mainland residents in an effort to control the outbreak. 10yr JGBs were flat after the recovery in risk appetite dampened safe-haven demand, but with downside also stemmed by support at 152.50 and amid the BoJ’s presence for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in up to 10yr maturities.</p><p>BoJ Summary of Opinions from the January meeting stated there has been no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost and that it is appropriate to maintain the current guidelines for market operations.

Furthermore, the BoJ stated that although risks concerning overseas economies remain significant, signs of recovery have started to be observed in part and there was the opinion that they may need to conduct review of policy framework given heightening debate in Europe and US over 'Japanification'.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar remains firm almost across the board, and especially vs EM currency peers that are more sensitive to risk aversion and prone to swings in market sentiment. The DXY continues to straddle 98.000 as several major pairings rotate around round numbers in tight confines ahead of the Fed that is likely to provide clearer direction via guidance and the tone of Chair Powell’s first post-meeting press conference of the New Year. In the interim, prelim trade and wholesale inventories may offer some impetus ahead of pending home sales, while any further updates on China’s coronavirus will also be pivotal.</p><p>JPY/SEK - Bucking the broad trend of underperformance vs the Greenback, the Yen is grinding back up towards the 109.00 level from 109.26 or so lows amidst a wider recovery in safe-haven assets, including Gold and global bonds, as the US Treasury curve flips back in to bull-flattening mode. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona is also paring more losses vs the Euro after yesterday’s knee-jerk decline post-soft data (overall) with some momentum from an improvement in industrial sentiment over consumer confidence that dipped, with Eur/Sek probing the lower end of 10.5965-5630 parameters.</p><p>GBP/AUD/CAD/EUR/CHF/NZD - All softer against the Usd to varying degrees, as Cable clings to 1.3000 in advance of Thursday’s eagerly awaited BoE rate call that is seen on a knife edge, while the Aussie is holding in above 0.6750 with assistance from firmer than forecast Q4 CPI metrics and supportive Aud/Nzd cross winds as the Kiwi falters close to Tuesday’s lows within a 0.6527-52 band awaiting NZ trade data later tonight. Elsewhere, the Loonie is gleaning some traction via firmer oil prices to consolidate between 1.3155-76 compared to 1.3200+ at one stage yesterday, but the Euro is still struggling to bounce from around 1.1000 after sub-consensus Eurozone M3 growth, and remains depressed vs the Franc in the low 1.0700 area even though Usd/Chf is hugging the top of 0.9750-27 extremes in wake of a fall in Swiss ZEW investor morale.</p><p>EM - In contrast to the aforementioned general depreciation against the Dollar, the offshore Yuan is sustaining recovery momentum on hopes that the worst of the health scare may be over soon, while the Rand is keeping its head just above 14.6000 following Moody’s decision that it is too early to review SA’s credit standing and post-budget will be more appropriate.</p><p>Australian CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.5%) Australian CPI (Q4) Y/Y 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 1.7%) Australian RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.4%) Australian RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (Q4) Y/Y 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.5% (Prev. 1.6%) Australian RBA Weighted Median CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.3%) Australian RBA Weighted Median CPI (Q4) Y/Y 1.3% vs. Exp. 1.3% (Prev. 1.2%)</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/CAD: 1.3065-80 (1BLN), 1.3100 (390M), 1.3125 (1.1BLN), 1.3150 (260M)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUD/JPY: 73.00 (1.3BLN)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It’s been a relatively slow grind, but no less compelling and perhaps fulfilling rebound across bond land, as <strong>Bunds</strong> completed a 180 degree turnaround before having a glance over 174.05 and then easing back after a so-so 5 year German auction, while Gilts edged a marginal new 134.82 Liffe high and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> topped out at 130-27. However, Italian <strong>BTPs</strong> are still leading the complex and hit 147.54 at best on more political relief and little in the way of syndication issues. Ahead, some US data to digest before Wednesday’s main course and afters in the form of the FOMC and Fed chair Powell.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front-month futures remain on consolidation-mode and hold onto most of their APAC gains, with prices somewhat relieved by the latest private inventory report. Headline crude posted a surprise draw of 4.27mln barrels vs. expectations for a 500k barrel build. Desks note that price action W/W suggest that markets see a substantial demand impact from the coronavirus outbreak, with airlines continuing to suspend travels to and from China. Demand side implications could be significantly impacted – contingent on the strictness of the travel restrictions and the time frame – which may prompt OPEC+ to revaluate their output cut pact. ING notes that prolonged pressure on oil prices could lead to deeper cuts by the oil-rich countries, although Libya’s current oil disruptions may help in regard to the scope of cuts Saudi and Russia could take on. Sources yesterday highlighted a slight shift in Russia’s stance, who prefers exiting the pact in March – but may be willing to stay on if Brent prices remain sub-60/bbl. That said, Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that the country's tax system may pose risks to Russia's ability to maintain oil output. Elsewhere <strong>spot gold</strong> has clambered off overnight lows as DXY pulled back from yesterday’s high, with the yellow metal on standby for significant macro developments ahead of the FOMC rate decision later today. Similarly<strong>, copper</strong> prices have experienced relatively muted price action thus far following six consecutive sessions of losses.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 24th Jan) -4.3mln (exp. +0.5mln, prev. +1.6mln).</strong> (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>Libya NOC said oil production on January 27th was at 271k bpd which was slightly up from the prior day.

Sectors are mostly in the green with material names outperforming, albeit more-so a consolidation from the recent virus-induces losses. Overall, sectors do not reflect a clear risk tone in the equity-space. Individual movers are more earning-orientated; Pharma-giant Novartis (+1.3%) shares rose amid a beat on both revenue and net income forecasts, whilst also forecasting sustained long-term growth, albeit the Co’s core EPS metric missed expectation. LVMH (+0.3%) nursed opening losses of almost 2%, which was initially induced by a 40% YY drop in Hong Kong sales in Q4 amid ongoing unrest in the region; the Co. topped its FY19 forecasts and posted an improvement in operating profit. Santander (+3.5%) extended on its opening gains amid stellar earnings, with share prices underpinned by a 3% boost to its dividend. Elsewhere, Apple (+2% pre-market) earnings have provided tailwinds to the European chip-space, with AMS (+2.5%), STMicroelectronics (+1.2%), Infineon (+1.4%), Dialog Semiconductor (+1.4%) and ASML (+1.3%) all supported in the aftermath. For reference, DJ constituents Boeing and McDonalds will be reported before the bell today and carry weightings of 7.47% and 4.97% respectively.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar remains firm almost across the board, and especially vs EM currency peers that are more sensitive to risk aversion and prone to swings in market sentiment. The DXY continues to straddle 98.000 as several major pairings rotate around round numbers in tight confines ahead of the Fed that is likely to provide clearer direction via guidance and the tone of Chair Powell’s first post-meeting press conference of the New Year. In the interim, prelim trade and wholesale inventories may offer some impetus ahead of pending home sales, while any further updates on China’s coronavirus will also be pivotal.</p><p>JPY/SEK - Bucking the broad trend of underperformance vs the Greenback, the Yen is grinding back up towards the 109.00 level from 109.26 or so lows amidst a wider recovery in safe-haven assets, including Gold and global bonds, as the US Treasury curve flips back in to bull-flattening mode. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona is also paring more losses vs the Euro after yesterday’s knee-jerk decline post-soft data (overall) with some momentum from an improvement in industrial sentiment over consumer confidence that dipped, with Eur/Sek probing the lower end of 10.5965-5630 parameters.</p><p>GBP/AUD/CAD/EUR/CHF/NZD - All softer against the Usd to varying degrees, as Cable clings to 1.3000 in advance of Thursday’s eagerly awaited BoE rate call that is seen on a knife edge, while the Aussie is holding in above 0.6750 with assistance from firmer than forecast Q4 CPI metrics and supportive Aud/Nzd cross winds as the Kiwi falters close to Tuesday’s lows within a 0.6527-52 band awaiting NZ trade data later tonight. Elsewhere, the Loonie is gleaning some traction via firmer oil prices to consolidate between 1.3155-76 compared to 1.3200+ at one stage yesterday, but the Euro is still struggling to bounce from around 1.1000 after sub-consensus Eurozone M3 growth, and remains depressed vs the Franc in the low 1.0700 area even though Usd/Chf is hugging the top of 0.9750-27 extremes in wake of a fall in Swiss ZEW investor morale.</p><p>EM - In contrast to the aforementioned general depreciation against the Dollar, the offshore Yuan is sustaining recovery momentum on hopes that the worst of the health scare may be over soon, while the Rand is keeping its head just above 14.6000 following Moody’s decision that it is too early to review SA’s credit standing and post-budget will be more appropriate.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s been a relatively slow grind, but no less compelling and perhaps fulfilling rebound across bond land, as Bunds completed a 180 degree turnaround before having a glance over 174.05 and then easing back after a so-so 5 year German auction, while Gilts edged a marginal new 134.82 Liffe high and US Treasuries topped out at 130-27. However, Italian BTPs are still leading the complex and hit 147.54 at best on more political relief and little in the way of syndication issues. Ahead, some US data to digest before Wednesday’s main course and afters in the form of the FOMC and Fed chair Powell.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures remain on consolidation-mode and hold onto most of their APAC gains, with prices somewhat relieved by the latest private inventory report. Headline crude posted a surprise draw of 4.27mln barrels vs. expectations for a 500k barrel build. Desks note that price action W/W suggest that markets see a substantial demand impact from the coronavirus outbreak, with airlines continuing to suspend travels to and from China. Demand side implications could be significantly impacted – contingent on the strictness of the travel restrictions and the time frame – which may prompt OPEC+ to revaluate their output cut pact. ING notes that prolonged pressure on oil prices could lead to deeper cuts by the oil-rich countries, although Libya’s current oil disruptions may help in regard to the scope of cuts Saudi and Russia could take on. Sources yesterday highlighted a slight shift in Russia’s stance, who prefers exiting the pact in March – but may be willing to stay on if Brent prices remain sub-60/bbl. That said, Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that the country's tax system may pose risks to Russia's ability to maintain oil output. Elsewhere <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> has clambered off overnight lows as DXY pulled back from yesterday’s high, with the yellow metal on standby for significant macro developments ahead of the FOMC rate decision later today. Similarly, <strong>copper</strong> prices have experienced relatively muted price action thus far following six consecutive sessions of losses.</p>",

This matched Monday’s intraday base and may have prompted some buyers to step in given no follow through selling on stops more than a full point down from Tuesday’s early high (173.48). However, the 173.94-97 area could form near term resistance ahead of 174.00 (vs 173.83 high so far), while BTPs are probing higher again and giving peripheral peers a lift and bonds will also be eyeing stocks as a proxy for sentiment surrounding China’s deadly virus. Ahead, Italian sentiment indicators and PPI flank Eurozone M3 before US data and the FOMC.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region gets some reprieve following the rebound on Wall St where sentiment was underpinned by vaccine efforts to tackle the coronavirus, touted dip-buying and encouraging US data, while a stellar report from Apple which beat on both top and bottom lines, as well as iPhone revenue added further fuel to equity futures after-hours. As such, ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) took impetus from their US peers but with upside somewhat limited as participants also digest a slew of corporate updates including Treasury Wine Estates which fell over 20% after lowering its guidance, while Tokyo sentiment is driven by favourable currency flows and a heavy slate of earnings. Conversely, Hang Seng (-2.6%) suffers a bloodbath on return from the Lunar New Year holiday with heavy losses across a broad range of industries including financials, airliners and retailers due to the coronavirus fears which has prompted measures from Hong Kong to reduce cross-border travel with mainland China, while gambling stocks also slumped after China stopped issuing individual travel visas for visits to Macau by mainland residents in an effort to control the outbreak.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady and holds above the 98.00 level following the mild support from better than expected data including US Consumer Confidence and Durable Goods, although overnight price action has been sideways as participants look ahead to the FOMC decision later today. EUR/USD is rangebound after having rebounded from support at 1.1000 and GBP/USD is indecisive just north of 1.3000 ahead of the BoE meeting on Thursday which markets perceive to be a coin toss. Furthermore, the UK government’s decision to permit Huawei involvement in the domestic 5G network is said to complicate a US-UK trade agreement and has spurred some senior Tory backbenchers to consider a Commons revolt to force a total ban on Huawei. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are supported by the improvement in global risk sentiment, while antipodeans are mixed with AUD/USD underpinned after Q4 inflation data which showed headline CPI Q/Q and Y/Y topped estimates, which led to RBC revising its RBA rate cut forecast to June from Q1 and JPMorgan also pushed back its call to May from February.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as the recovery in risk appetite dampens safe-haven demand, but with downside stemmed by support at 152.50 and amid the BoJ’s presence for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in up to 10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",
