In related news, VOX reported on Friday that 2 US officials and a source familiar with deliberations suggested there were still plans for the US to strike Iran on Friday night although it was also possible that the plan would not be put into action. (Twitter/NBC/VOX/EHA News)</p><p>US President Trump said he has no pre-conditions for talks with Iran and that he would be willing to meet with the Ayatollah or President but added that ballistic missiles would have to be considered in a deal. However, US President Trump also said that they are moving ahead with additional sanctions on Iran aimed at preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon and that military action is still on the table, while other reports also noted the White House is pressing for additional options including in cyberspace and other additional clandestine plans to counter Iranian aggression in the Persian Gulf.

Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (LH) was upgraded at Deutsche Bank, which cited attractive valuations. PG&amp;E (PCG) is mulling restructuring plan, which offered two-way volatility. Caterpillar (CAT) was under pressure, after a downgrade at Atlantic Equities, which is concerned about the global demand outlook. Apple (AAPL) was under pressure amid the iPhone maker recalling some of its MacBook Pro laptops in China. Micron Technologies (MU) fell after a number of brokers reduced their PTs for the chipmaker, citing concerns over the Huawei ban. Canopy Growth Corp (CGC) sunk after reporting bigger losses than expected, dragging stakeholder Constellation Brands (STZ) with it. PayPal (PYPL) fell after its COO resigned. Carnival Corp (CCL) fell, with Barclays downgrading the stock to underweight. The FTC has issued an objection to Qualcomm’s (QCOM) legal push to introduce internal Apple documents as evidence against the enforcement of the antitrust ruling made against the chipmaker in May. Tesla (TSLA) was also under pressure after a source suggested that Q2 optimism on deliveries may be overdone. Energy names performed well as crude prices remained elevated, as did gold names as Gold reclaimed the USD 1400 handle. S&amp;P 500 -0.1% at 2951, NASDAQ-100 -0.1% at 7729, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26720.</p><p>Treasuries gave back some of the geopolitically induced gains seen on Thursday, with yields settling 5-7bps higher across the curve; this added some daylight between the 10-year yield and the 2% handle (which was breached on Thursday for the first time since Nov’2016). However, geopolitical analysts have warned that the tensions are far from over, and even though Trump has reached out to Iranian leaders for unconditional talks, military options remain. One macro desk noted that the 10-year yield is set to close higher for the seventh consecutive week, a rare event which last occurred in July 2016 (then finished sharply lower the next week, coinciding with Brexit events). Most of the run of today’s Fedspeak was an echo of the dovishness seen at the FOMC this week; the probability of a July rate cut has edged up to around 70% on Friday (from 60% a week ago), and money markets are pricing just shy of three rate cuts by the end of the year (CFTC data showed speculators adding long positions ahead of the Fed meeting). Next week’s sales of 2s, 5s and 7s will be eyed, with desks suggesting that the dovish Fed pricing could support the complex, like we saw in the 3s/10s/30s auctions recently, especially so amid the geopolitical background. US T-notes (U9) settled 17+ lower at 127-16+.</p>",
