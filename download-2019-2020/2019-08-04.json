(Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>There were initial reports that US President Trump is willing to shelve China tariffs if China takes positive action, according to CNBC's Tausche citing a senior admin official. However, NEC Director Kudlow later stated he has not heard anything definitive about a possibility of China tariff delays and that US President Trump is not satisfied with progress in talks. Furthermore, Kudlow stated that a number of good things could happen in the month prior to tariffs going on Chinese goods and that good things could arise from the September meeting between US and China. (Newswires/CNBC/Fox)</p><p>China said on Friday it would not “give an inch” by offering trade concessions to the United States and promised to retaliate if US President Trump went ahead with imposing further tariffs. (SCMP)</p><p>China’s US Ambassador said if the US wants to talk about trade, then so will China, and if the US want to fight, so will China, while he added that new tariffs are an irrational and irresponsible act which Beijing will take new adequate countermeasures against. The Ambassador also commented on Hong Kong protests which he said are turning out to be violent as well as chaotic and should no longer be allowed to continue. (Newswires)</p><p>China's Global Times Editor said the Chinese side always has a second plan B including a series of counter measures and that Beijing is very disappointed by the latest \"flip-flops of the US\", while he quoted a well-informed official as saying \"China won't fight the battle unprepared”. (Twitter)</p><p>PBoC will comprehensively use multiple monetary policy tools in H2 and maintain prudent monetary policy, while it will strengthen counter cyclical adjustments and lower RRR at an appropriate time. PBoC will also continue interest rate and exchange rate reform, as well as keep liquidity reasonably ample. (Newswires)</p><p>Protests continued in Hong Kong again in which police fired tear gas into protesters. There were comments from the Hong Kong government that illegal protests are pushing the city to extremely dangerous edge, while China stated it will not allow the situation to persist.

In related news, PM Johnson’s most senior aide Dominic Cummings told ministers and officials Johnson will honour his October 31st pledge even if Jeremy Corbyn and pro-Remain Conservatives succeed in forcing a general election. (Newswires/Telegraph)</p><p>US President Trump confirmed he will sign a beef agreement with EU which will make it easier for US firms to export to the EU and result in a 46% increase in US exports of beef to the EU. In other news, US President Trump said EU auto tariffs are never off the table and that if he doesn't get what he wants, he'll have no choice but to put on auto tariffs.

Higher beta and China exposed sectors were the underperformers; Chipmakers Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lead the Nasdaq 100 lower. The FANG index sunk, with analysts at Bank of America noting that Trump’s new tariffs would put a dent in Apple’s (AAPL) earnings. Defensive sector outperformance saw the utility, consumer staple and health care sectors comparatively well supported. Decent earnings from Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were unable to turn the tide, the energy sector sunk with lower crude prices (compared to the beginning of the week), and recent poor earnings from the likes of Concho Resources (CXO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) dragging on the sector. Boeing (BA) was well supported on the news that the co. is redesigning its 737 MAX so that it is dependent on both of the plane’s flight-control systems instead of just one. Cloudera (CLDR) shot higher on the news that activist investor Carl Ichan had taken a 12.6% stake in the co., and said he would speak with the board and management about enhancing shareholder value. IBM (IBM) spiked higher on the news that the co. is targeting single digit growth in FY20/21. S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 2932, Nasdaq-100 -1.4% at 7692, Dow Jones -0.4% at 26487.</p><p>The yield curve flattened, taking its cue from escalating trade escalations, shrugging-off a generally upbeat payrolls report. Markets have now fully priced a September rate cut, and have 100bps of easing priced through the end of 2020 (note, in wake of the payrolls report, it was roughly 70bps priced, which suggests that traders have added to their easing expectations in wake of the trade escalation. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower. US T-note (U9) futures settled 5+ ticks higher at 128-27+.</p>",
