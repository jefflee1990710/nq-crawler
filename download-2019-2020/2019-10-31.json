China also reportedly expressed worries that US President Trump would pull out of the “limited” Phase One Deal, despite both sides wanting to sign the deal in a few weeks’. However, prior to the report, China’s MOFCOM announced negotiations were progressing well, and teams remain in close communication, reiterating the two sides are to hold a phone call tomorrow. NEC Director Kudlow also stated that current talks are progressing well. Elsewhere, China’s Trade Association Chief stated China could remove extra tariffs on US farm products to help importers purchase as much as USD 50bln worth of agricultural goods, a move which has been a recent sticking point in talks, where US Treasury Mnuchin said it will take time to scale up to this figure. On the APEC summit location, President Trump tweeted the two sides are working on selecting a new site to sign the Phase One deal, with a location to be announced soon. Trump stated that the Phase One part of the deal is roughly 60% of the total deal, however, CNBC highlighted that most experts would say it represents a significantly smaller portion of what the US was seeking.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) made solid gains after reporting beats on top and bottom line estimates, with strong guidance and growth in its pinnacle iPhone segment, whilst its grossing services unit also saw double digit growth. Other FAANG component, Facebook (FB), also beat earnings estimates, seeing it outperform, despite lighter than expected monthly and daily average users. Western Digital (WDC) tumbled lower on light Q2 guidance and its CEO retiring; KLA Corp (KLAC) also weighed on semis despite a strong earnings report. Kraft Heinz (KHZ) made double digit gains on a strong earnings beat. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) traded choppy after an average earnings report. Altria (MO) beat top and bottom, but the poised chalice that is its Juul stake saw the co announce a USD 4.5bln write down. Bristol-Myers (BMY) traded firmer on an EPS and revenue beat, as did its merger target, Celgene (CELG). Starbucks (SBUX) drifted lower throughout the day, alongside indices, despite meeting/beating analyst expectations for its earnings report and guidance. Lyft (LYFT) also drifted lower after beating expectations for top and bottom line, whilst raising guidance, bringing competitor Uber (UBER) down with it. Stocks that caught a bid on their earnings included Abiomed (ABMD), Global Payments (GPN), LKQ (LKQ), BorgWarner (BWA), Teleflex (TFX), IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX), Gartner (IT), Cognizant (CTSH), International Paper (IP) and Archer Daniels Midlands (ADM). Conversely, stocks that sold off on their earnings included Lincoln National (LNC), HanesBrands (HBI), FLIR Systems (FLIR), Xylem (XYL), Church &amp; Dwight (CHD), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Estee Lauder (EL) and Corteva (CTVA).</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> North Korea fired two projectiles, however it did landed outside of the Japanese EEZ, and it appeared to be a short-range missile, therefore unlikely to raise too much concern with the US, although it did note that it was monitoring the situation. SCMP reported China will not sit back if the US were to deploy intermediate range missiles in Asia, as Beijing accuses the US of trying to gain military advantage by pulling out of Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty citing a ministry spokesman Wu Qian. In Syria, SDF sources and witnesses noted that US forces conducted a patrol on the Turkey border for the first time since its decision to withdraw the region. Over in Hong Kong, protests still continue with police firing tear gas at protestors to try and break them up.</p><p><strong>* US PERSONAL INCOME &amp; SPENDING: </strong>Spending rose by 0.2% on the month, in line with expectations. Capital Economics noted that the figure was a “slightly stronger” end to Q3 than it had expected, providing impetus as the US moves into Q4. Personal income rose as expected by 0.3%, a “solid” pace the consultancy adds, whilst the prior was revised higher by 0.1% to 0.5%. Capital Economics questions whether the income gains can be maintained, citing the government farm subsidies as boosting the August and September figures, as of such, still believes Q4 GDP will slow to an annualised rate of 1.0% as the economy cools further. More ominously, the Core PCE Price Index Y/Y fell by 0.1% (also as expected) to 1.7%, yet another sign of faltering inflation and if extended, could force the Fed to stimulate more.</p><p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI: </strong>October’s reading fell to 43.2, the lowest since December 2015, from a prior 47.1, falling beneath all analyst expectations. Boeing (BA) is headquartered in Chicago. The report noted that both New Orders and Backlogs fell sharply this month, with the former falling to 37, its lowest since March 2009 and the latter seeing the largest monthly decline falling 13.6 points to 33.1. Employment remained beneath 50 but ticked up 4.2 points to 49.8. Prices cooled for the third consecutive month, with the report citing evidence of lower steel prices, although tariffs did provide some upside pressure. The dismal print soured the risk appetite throughout the rest of the session with eyes on tomorrow national ISM PMI’s to see if it is just contained to Chicago, or throughout the US. However, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes the “Chicago PMI does not always correctly signal the month to month movement in the national ISM index”. Although, the consultancy adds this report makes it harder to support a rebound in the national reading tomorrow after the September print fell to 47.8 from 49.10 in August. Pantheon said it now lowers its forecast to 48 from 50, noting the overall picture shows continued stress in the manufacturing sector, due to the direct impacts of tariffs and uncertainty of the future direction of trade policy.</p><p><strong>* CHINA OFFICIAL PMI:</strong> October’s print came in at 49.3, lower than expectations for 49.8 and the prior of 49.8. The non-manufacturing print was also soft at 52.8 (vs. exp. 53.7 and prev. 53.7), as was the composite measure, which was down to 52.0 from 53.1. The manufacturing report notes that factory operator sentiment remained in negative territory for the 6th consecutive month. The decline in activity spurred from a deterioration in new orders, falling to the lowest level since June, whilst exports saw the lowest print since July, although production continued to grow. CapEco said “the decline in new export orders points towards a further slowdown in export growth”. This latest PMI reading is likely to be viewed in the context of the broader slowdown in the Chinese economy, Q3 GDP numbers earlier in the month saw growth slipped to 27-year lows at 6%, the bottom end of the nation’s 2019 growth target between 6-6.5%. Other worrying signals include trade data for September, which showed that both exports and imports fell 3.2% and 8.5%, respectively. Also, PPI has been in deflation for the past three months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>BoJ kept its monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with rates kept at -0.1% and 10yr yield target at around 0%. The BoJ tweaked forward guidance to “Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary” from the prior “at least through around spring 2020”. The Central Bank noted that this is to pay close attention to the chance that momentum for hitting price target will be lost, although it added there has been no further increase in this chance at the moment. Further, BoJ stated Japan’s economy is likely to grow below potential temporarily but will likely continue expanding as a trend, while it noted that risks are skewed to the downside for the economy and it lowered all growth and inflation forecasts in its Outlook Report, as expected. At the post-meeting presser, Governor Kuroda reiterated the central bank’s willingness to dive deeper into negative rates if needed despite concerns of side effects on the banking sector, whilst adding that the BoJ can take various measures if the yield curve flattens too much, which was eluded to after the central bank recently increased its front-end bond buying.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN GDP (Aug): </strong>Canadian GDP for the month of August came in at 0.1%, slightly lower than expectations for 0.2%. The internals, however, paint a slightly more positive picture; “commodities output was soft with oil and gas extraction reportedly temporarily restrained by maintenance shutdowns for a second consecutive month” notes RBC, adding “the oil and gas sector isn't expected to be a major source of near-term growth as long as transportation constraints out of western Canada remain in place”. The bank concludes that the monthly drop in July is probably more “noise” than any definitive signal. The bank also points to an unusual drop in utilities output, due to a cooler than normal August weather, which it says will be unwound. Taking these two components out, Canada’s GDP grew at a healthy 0.3% for the month. As a reminder, yesterday, the BoC released its MPR report where it boosted its Q3 real-GDP growth view to 1.4 % (Prev. 1.1%) and its 2019 end real GDP to 1.7% from 1.5%, however the central bank cut its End-2020 real GDP growth by 0.4% to 1.6%.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 3038, NASDAQ-100 0% at 8084, Dow Jones -0.5% at 27046</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.5%, Consumer Staples -0.2%, Energy -0.5%, Financials -0.6%, Health Care -0.1%, Industrials -1.1%, Information Technology -0.1%, Materials -1.1%, Telecommunication Services 0.3%, Utilities 0.5%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Stock related news flow (barring earnings) was light, however, Twitter (TWTR) moved lower with indices amid it announcing it would not facilitate political advertisements. Etsy (ETSY) dived lower after a slew of PT cuts across brokerages. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) came under pressure after announcing a surgical stapler recall.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.88 LOWER AT USD 54.18/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.62 LOWER AT USD 59.62/BBL:</strong> Crude markets are lower on Thursday, amid familiar global growth-related concerns; Chicago PMI came in much weaker than expected, raising fears of disappointment in tomorrow’s ISM manufacturing print, while a Bloomberg report suggested that China is doubtful that it can agree a Phase Two trade deal with the US. Compounding global growth fears, Chinese PMI data also came in soft, although crude was unresponsive at the time. WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 20 futures had a solid morning, reaching heights of USD 55.60/bbl and USD 60.80/bbl respectively, before the complex crashed to lows of USD 53.75/bbl and USD 59.25/bbl. Crude markets have now given up the majority of last week’s gains. Supply side news took a back seat; according to sources, Alberta has announced curtailment relief for oil which is shipped via rail. Elsewhere, Russia fulfilled its OPEC+ deal commitments by 73% in October, according to Interfax, with production at 11.23mln BPD for the month.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 26 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-09+: </strong>The TPLEX sang to the tune of risk appetite, making gains throughout the day as equity bourses moved lower on revived US-China trade deal caution. Sellers found little reprieve as data also supported the haven bid, with a surprise multi-year low in the Chicago PMI and the Core PCE Price Index showed downward pricing pressures. Positioning was also likely to be supportive for the debt complex, with month end factors and an expected volatile NFP report on Friday. By settlement the entire yield curve was lower by approximately 10bps.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP</strong>: <strong>DXY</strong> remained near post FOMC lows, only falling slightly heading into the final day of the week where participants are eyeing the US jobs report, a slew of Fed speak and national ISM data. The index traded in a tight range from 97.216 at the lows, and a high of 97.449, where it opened trade post FOMC yesterday. The lows printed after reports that China is doubtful about the possibility of a long-term trade deal, which sought a bid into havens.&nbsp; <strong>Havens</strong> traded firmer on the aforementioned China comments, with USDJPY outperforming as it broke 108 to the downside, where it resides flirting with the level heading into Asia trade. <strong>XAU</strong> reclaimed the 1500 handle from lows of 1984 as it sought highs of 1514, before paring back slightly in afternoon trade to 1510. <strong>CHF</strong> also bid against major currency pairs, albeit rather flat against GBP. <strong>Sterling</strong> trades firmer today with month end likely playing a factor, as Citi’s final month end rebalancing signalled particular USD weakness against GBP and EUR. On UK elections, the latest Ipsos Mori poll put the conservatives in the lead gaining 8 ppts to 41%, with labour unchanged at 24%. <strong>EUR </strong>traded sideways today as it was fairly unreactive to a 0.1% beat on its flash GDP reading which came in at 0.2% for Q3. EU HICP slowed to 0.7% from 0.8%, in line with expectations and unemployment was unchanged as the prior was revised 0.1% higher to 7.5%. <strong>EMFX</strong> traded weaker against the buck across the board on a risk off tone. <strong>BRL</strong>, also taking its cue from the BCB who cut its Selic rate by 50bps as expected, accompanied by a cautious statement as it notes the current economic cycle warrants stimulative monetary policy.&nbsp; <strong>ZAR</strong> also cautious ahead of Moody’s rating on the nation tomorrow and ongoing budget, economic and Eskom concerns. <strong>TRY </strong>outperformed its EM peers, albeit still weaker against the Greenback. The CBRT’s latest inflation outlook declined to 12% from 13.9%, a positive sign for the region, as it noted it expects inflation to converge gradually to its 5% target in the medium term. However, CBRT Governor Uysal noted they have used most of their space in loosening monetary policy, as the CBRT cut by 1000bps across its last three meetings.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar was already retreating further from initial post-Fed peaks before headlines broke quoting Chinese officials that are said to be doubtful on the prospects of a long term trade deal with the US, as Beijing is unwilling to make major structural changes and insists that existing tariffs are taken off to advance to the 2nd phase of negotiations. The reports came hot on the heels of Chile’s decision to axe the APEC Summit that had been touted as the event for Presidents Trump and Xi to sign phase 1, but the former is still searching for an alternative venue and NEC Director Kudlow claims that talks between Washington and Beijing are still progressing well. However, sentiment remains rather sombre and perhaps not helped by a dire Chicago PMI given that the FOMC has indicated an end or at least pause to mid-cycle easing, not to mention the fact that Chinese PMI surveys were also pretty bleak overnight. The <strong>DXY</strong> has pared some losses within a 97.216-449 range, but the Greenback is still mixed on balance with underperformance vs even safer-havens and vice-versa, while a late month end rebalancing signal came in negative vs neutral at one stage.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen has gradually extended gains vs the Buck after overcoming a technical hurdle in the form of the 21 DMA (108.59) and a psychological level (109.50) before setting sights on 108.00 and 2.5 bn expiries between 108.10 and the big figure. Meanwhile, the Kiwi managed to maintain 0.6400+ status and forged more gains relative to its Aussie counterpart through 1.0750 following a rebound in NBNZ business expectations, albeit still well below zero and Westpac pushing its projection for the next RBNZ rate cut out from November to February next year. Similarly, the Pound derived independent impetus to offset a broader downturn in risk appetite as pre-UK election polls pointed to rising support for PM Johnson’s Conservatives and media speculation circulated about tactical moves by the Brexit Party that could play into Tory hands. Nevertheless, Cable faded as the Buck bottomed and drifted down towards 1.2925, while Eur/Gbp staged yet another assault on 0.8600 with talk of fix interest, but was repelled again. Elsewhere, the Franc was underpinned on safe-haven grounds, but to a lesser extent than the Jpy or Xau, as Usd/Chf held above 0.9850 vs Gold topping Usd1514/oz, and comments from SNB head Jordan capped further upside as he reiterated the importance of NIRP and direct intervention to ensure that the Swiss currency does not rally too far.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/AUD</strong></p><p>The Loonie shrugged off weaker than expected Canadian GDP and PPI updates to stay anchored around 1.3150, but could not pare more post-BoC declines amidst bearish crude price action into month end. The single currency largely tracked Dollar moves and the wider market mood swings after waning in early trade circa 1.1175 and slipping back to sub-1.1150, but the Aussie looks set to end Thursday’s Asia-Pac and EU session as the G10 laggard, with Aud/Usd down to 0.6890 from 0.6930 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The aforementioned risk-off tone hampered most regional currencies, but Usd/Zar remained more elevated than peers, above 15.0000, on the back of ongoing SA budget and economic concerns after yesterday’s MTBS and with ‘details’ of Eskom’s transmission development plan hardly helping to allay fears given very little in the way of actual substance. Note, S&amp;P was pretty scathing about the SA’s financial aid for the utility and Moody’s delivers its verdict on Friday.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>KOSPI (+0.2%)</strong> was boosted by index heavyweight Samsung Electronics which surpassed its profit guidance and Apple suppliers in Taiwan saw mixed fortunes despite a strong Q4 result from the US tech giant which beat on top and bottom lines, as well as iPhone revenue but missed on iPad and Mac sales. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.9%)</strong> outperformed overnight after the HKMA lowered rates in lockstep with the Fed and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%)</strong> was less decisive after another PBoC liquidity drain, weaker than expected Chinese Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data, as well as some uncertainty after Chile cancelled the APEC summit next month. Finally, 10yr JGBs rallied from the open ahead of the BoJ announcement after source reports suggested that the BoJ is considering modifying its forward guidance to more clearly signal the chance of a future rate cut, although JGB prices pulled back aggressively following the BoJ announcement which was met with disappointment given that the bank’s new guidance for “short and long-term rates to stay at current or lower levels as long as needed“ didn’t provide anything ground-breaking, as the bank have previously reiterated the possibility for further negative rates.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 60bln.

The BoJ noted that this is to pay close attention to chance momentum for hitting price target will be lost although it added there has been no further increase in chance of momentum for hitting price target will be lost but must continue to pay attention to the possibility. Furthermore, BoJ stated Japan’s economy is likely to grow below potential temporarily but will likely continue expanding as a trend, while it noted that risks are skewed to the downside for the economy and it lowered all growth and inflation forecasts in its Outlook Report.

Underperformance is being seen in the FTSE 100 (-1.07%) – weighed on by index heavy weight Royal Dutch Shell (-3.6%) after it reported disappointing earnings, in which the Co. noted risks to the completion of its share repurchase programme (Note: Shell A and B shares account for 11% of the FTSE 100). Meanwhile, the FTSE MIB (-0.1%) fares slightly better, with decent gains in Fiat Chrysler (+8.7%) on the terms of its merger with Peugeot (-12.3%) and with each to own 50% share in the merged entity. Prior to the US/China trade headlines, global equities had been holding on to yesterday’s post FOMC gains; in which the Fed cut rates by 25bps but indicated it would likely be on hold going forward. The sectors meanwhile are relatively defensive; Utilities (+0.7%), Health Care (-0.3%) and Consumer Staples (+0.1%) outperform while Energy (-2.4%) is the laggard on Shell. Prior to the risk off move, Tech (-0.7%) had been leading the pack higher, following strong earnings from strong earnings from Apple and Facebook (4.8% and 1.8% higher respectively in premarket trade). In terms of other individual movers; decent earnings saw Sanofi (-0.2%) bid at the open, albeit the Co. reversed gains amid the aforementioned US-China trade news. Conversely, weaker than expected earnings from Air France (-3.8%), Lloyds (-2.7%), BT (+0.5%) and Swiss RE (-1.9%) saw their respective shares under pressure.</p><p><strong>Apple Inc (AAPL)</strong> Q4 EPS USD 3.03 vs. Exp.

The DXY is holding just off 97.216 lows compared to 97.449 at one stage and considerably higher in knee-jerk Fed rate cut and shift to pause mode trade.</p><p>JPY/CHF/GBP/EUR - Risk-off sentiment prompted by the aforementioned Chinese concerns and conditions regarding trade negotiations with the US and more NK missile tests has (naturally) boosted the likes of the Yen and Franc (while Gold has also benefited and reclaimed Usd1500+/oz status), with Usd/Jpy retreating sharply through the 21 DMA (108.59), 108.50 and now testing 108.25 that would expose hefty option expiries between 108.00-10 (2.5 bn) if breached. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is hovering close to the base of a 0.9895-60 range and Sterling is muscling in, albeit with bullish UK election momentum also underpinning the Pound amidst reports that the Brexit party may pull candidates and boost Tory votes in the process. Cable is holding near 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp is having another look at support ahead of 0.8600 even though the single currency is outpacing the Dollar with Eur/Usd firm within a 1.1150.75 band.</p><p>NZD/AUD/CAD - Somewhat contrasting fortunes down under, as the Kiwi clings to 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and stays above 1.0800 against the Aussie despite the latest China-US headlines and downbeat Chinese PMIs overnight with the aid of Westpac rolling its RBNZ ease forecast to February 2020 from next month and an improvement in the NBNZ business outlook. Conversely, Aud/Usd is losing grip of 0.6900 and Usd/Cad remains elevated between 1.3148-78 parameters following yesterday’s cautious BoC outlook and eyeing Canadian data in the form of GDP, PPI and AWE.</p><p>EM - A steeper retreat from recent peaks by the Rand as the risk aversion noted above merely adds to weakness stoked by SA’s MTBS and investor angst that Eskom aid is not as comprehensive as anticipated or hoped. Usd/Zar has been above 5.1800, but now paring back a tad.</p><p>Australian Building Approvals (Sep) M/M 7.6% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. -1.1%).

(Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core bonds have backed off a bit, but remain firmly bid with Bunds still some ¾ point ahead, Gilts 50+ ticks above parity and the 10 year T-note hovering just below 130-00, as corresponding yields probe some psychological levels, like -40 bp and 1.75%. The rationale for the rallies are multi-fold and self-sustaining or propelling as chart levels break to trigger technical and short-stops, while the overall post-FOMC curve flattening theme persists. Ahead, a raft of US data as October draws to a close and a potential renewed debt bull fest if the macro releases are weak given that Fed rate cut expectations have diminished appreciably.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crude markets have eroded earlier gains after US/China trade related risk off saw this morning’s tentative gains quickly given back. WTI Dec’ 19 futures topped out around USD 55.60/bbl and Brent Jan’ 20 at USD 60.80/bbl, before a souring of sentiment saw the contracts fall as low as USD 54.85/bbl and USD 60.05/bbl respectively. In terms of crude specific news; the 590mln bpd Keystone pipeline, which carries crude oil from Alberta, Canada to refineries in the US, was shut yesterday after a spill, with little clarity on how long the disruption will last. Separate reports alleged that TC Energy has declared a 'force majeure' on the pipeline. “These developments will not be welcome news for Canadian producers” notes ING “with it likely to weigh on the WCS-WTI differential”. Meanwhile, source reports last night that US plans to allow Russian, Chinese and European companies to continue non-proliferation work with Iran by renewing sanctions waivers, although the news appears to have done little to change the dial. In terms of Metals; Gold is bid on 1) a weaker buck post-FOMC, 2) weak overnight Chinese PMI data 3) jitters regarding North Korean missile tests and, most recently, 4) negative US/China trade headlines. Meanwhile Copper prices saw renewed pressure amid the overall risk sentiment coupled with the dismal China data, with the red metal now below earlier reported resistance at USD 2.660/lbs to make fresh weekly lows.&nbsp;</p>",

Underperformance is being seen in the FTSE 100 (-1.07%) – weighed on by index heavy weight Royal Dutch Shell (-3.6%) after it reported disappointing earnings, in which the Co. noted risks to the completion of its share repurchase programme (Note: Shell A and B shares account for 11% of the FTSE 100). Meanwhile, the FTSE MIB (-0.1%) fares slightly better, with decent gains in Fiat Chrysler (+8.7%) on the terms of its merger with Peugeot (-12.3%) and with each to own 50% share in the merged entity. Prior to the US/China trade headlines, global equities had been holding on to yesterday’s post FOMC gains; in which the Fed cut rates by 25bps but indicated it would likely be on hold going forward. The sectors meanwhile are relatively defensive; Utilities (+0.7%), Health Care (-0.3%) and Consumer Staples (+0.1%) outperform while Energy (-2.4%) is the laggard on Shell. Prior to the risk off move, Tech (-0.7%) had been leading the pack higher, following strong earnings from strong earnings from Apple and Facebook (4.8% and 1.8% higher respectively in premarket trade). In terms of other individual movers; decent earnings saw Sanofi (-0.2%) bid at the open, albeit the Co. reversed gains amid the aforementioned US-China trade news. Conversely, weaker than expected earnings from Air France (-3.8%), Lloyds (-2.7%), BT (+0.5%) and Swiss RE (-1.9%) saw their respective shares under pressure.</p><p>FX</p><p>USD - The Greenback remains under pressure in the FOMC aftermath as some month end rebalancing models are negative in contrast to neutral signals flagged earlier in October, while the latest comments from China on the US trade front have been net bearish for the Buck with Beijing apparently raising doubts about the prospect of a long term accord given a reluctance to make major structural reforms and demands that Washington removes all tariffs before moving forward to Phase 2 talks. The DXY is holding just off 97.216 lows compared to 97.449 at one stage and considerably higher in knee-jerk Fed rate cut and shift to pause mode trade.</p><p>JPY/CHF/GBP/EUR - Risk-off sentiment prompted by the aforementioned Chinese concerns and conditions regarding trade negotiations with the US and more NK missile tests has (naturally) boosted the likes of the Yen and Franc (while Gold has also benefited and reclaimed Usd1500+/oz status), with Usd/Jpy retreating sharply through the 21 DMA (108.59), 108.50 and now testing 108.25 that would expose hefty option expiries between 108.00-10 (2.5 bn) if breached. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is hovering close to the base of a 0.9895-60 range and Sterling is muscling in, albeit with bullish UK election momentum also underpinning the Pound amidst reports that the Brexit party may pull candidates and boost Tory votes in the process. Cable is holding near 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp is having another look at support ahead of 0.8600 even though the single currency is outpacing the Dollar with Eur/Usd firm within a 1.1150.75 band.</p><p>NZD/AUD/CAD - Somewhat contrasting fortunes down under, as the Kiwi clings to 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and stays above 1.0800 against the Aussie despite the latest China-US headlines and downbeat Chinese PMIs overnight with the aid of Westpac rolling its RBNZ ease forecast to February 2020 from next month and an improvement in the NBNZ business outlook. Conversely, Aud/Usd is losing grip of 0.6900 and Usd/Cad remains elevated between 1.3148-78 parameters following yesterday’s cautious BoC outlook and eyeing Canadian data in the form of GDP, PPI and AWE.</p><p>EM - A steeper retreat from recent peaks by the Rand as the risk aversion noted above merely adds to weakness stoked by SA’s MTBS and investor angst that Eskom aid is not as comprehensive as anticipated or hoped. Usd/Zar has been above 5.1800, but now paring back a tad.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core bonds have backed off a bit, but remain firmly bid with Bunds still some ¾ point ahead, Gilts 50+ ticks above parity and the 10 year T-note hovering just below 130-00, as corresponding yields probe some psychological levels, like -40 bp and 1.75%. The rationale for the rallies are multi-fold and self-sustaining or propelling as chart levels break to trigger technical and short-stops, while the overall post-FOMC curve flattening theme persists. Ahead, a raft of US data as October draws to a close and a potential renewed debt bull fest if the macro releases are weak given that Fed rate cut expectations have diminished appreciably.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crude markets have eroded earlier gains after US/China trade related risk off saw this morning’s tentative gains quickly given back. WTI Dec’ 19 futures topped out around USD 55.60/bbl and Brent Jan’ 20 at USD 60.80/bbl, before a souring of sentiment saw the contracts fall as low as USD 54.85/bbl and USD 60.05/bbl respectively. In terms of crude specific news; the 590mln bpd Keystone pipeline, which carries crude oil from Alberta, Canada to refineries in the US, was shut yesterday after a spill, with little clarity on how long the disruption will last. Separate reports alleged that TC Energy has declared a 'force majeure' on the pipeline. “These developments will not be welcome news for Canadian producers” notes ING “with it likely to weigh on the WCS-WTI differential”. Meanwhile, source reports last night that US plans to allow Russian, Chinese and European companies to continue non-proliferation work with Iran by renewing sanctions waivers, although the news appears to have done little to change the dial. In terms of Metals; Gold is bid on 1) a weaker buck post-FOMC, 2) weak overnight Chinese PMI data 3) jitters regarding North Korean missile tests and, most recently, 4) negative US/China trade headlines. Meanwhile Copper prices saw renewed pressure amid the overall risk sentiment coupled with the dismal China data, with the red metal now below earlier reported resistance at USD 2.660/lbs to make fresh weekly lows.&nbsp;</p>",

Cable is holding near 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp is having another look at support ahead of 0.8600 even though the single currency is outpacing the Dollar with Eur/Usd firm within a 1.1150.75 band.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Somewhat contrasting fortunes down under, as the Kiwi clings to 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and stays above 1.0800 against the Aussie despite the latest China-US headlines and downbeat Chinese PMIs overnight with the aid of Westpac rolling its RBNZ ease forecast to February 2020 from next month and an improvement in the NBNZ business outlook. Conversely, Aud/Usd is losing grip of 0.6900 and Usd/Cad remains elevated between 1.3148-78 parameters following yesterday’s cautious BoC outlook and eyeing Canadian data in the form of GDP, PPI and AWE.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>A steeper retreat from recent peaks by the Rand as the risk aversion noted above merely adds to weakness stoked by SA’s MTBS and investor angst that Eskom aid is not as comprehensive as anticipated or hoped. Usd/Zar has been above 5.1800, but now paring back a tad.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive after the mild post-FOMC tailwinds from US where the Fed cut rates as expected but signalled it is to likely pause, with participants also digesting a slew of blue-chip earnings and disappointing Chinese PMI data. ASX 200 (-0.6%) is among the few laggards and is pressured by underperformance in its largest weighted financials sector after Big 4 lender ANZ Bank reported flat profits amid challenging conditions, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is just about kept afloat amid a mixed currency and with a deluge of earnings including Sony which raised its FY net forecasts. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+0.8%) is boosted by index heavyweight Samsung Electronics which surpassed its profit guidance and Apple suppliers in Taiwan saw mixed fortunes despite a strong Q4 result from the US tech giant which beat on top and bottom lines, as well as iPhone revenue but missed on iPad and Mac sales. Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are positive with Hong Kong lifted after the HKMA lowered rates in lockstep with the Fed, although the gains in the mainland are restricted after another PBoC liquidity drain, weaker than expected Chinese Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data, as well as some trade uncertainty after Chile cancelled the APEC summit next month where the US and China were hoping to sign the phase 1 trade deal.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is weaker across the board following the Fed decision to cut rates for the 3rd time this year. The DXY initially rallied in a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement due to a tweak in the Fed’s statement that omitted the reference regarding “to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion” which many viewed as the end to the mid-cycle adjustment, although the advances were then faded amid Fed Chair Powell’s press conference where he stated the current stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate and effectively ruled out prospects of a hike which suggests the bias for monetary policy to be on hold or lower. EUR/USD trades at its strongest level in more than a week and GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.2900 handle as they gained from the broad USD weakness, while antipodeans are also firmer with AUD/USD supported by stronger than expected Building Approvals and NZD/USD benefitting after Westpac pushed back its RBNZ rate cut forecast to February next year from a prior view of a reduction next month. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed ahead of the looming BoJ announcement with price action largely reflecting their base currencies.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher heading into the BoJ announcement as source reports recently suggested that the BoJ is considering modifying its forward guidance to more clearly signal the chance of a future rate cut.</p>",
