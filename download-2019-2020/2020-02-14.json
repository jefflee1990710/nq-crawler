US data was mixed on Friday, and certainly nothing to cause traders to pile into risk assets ahead of the weekend, where the narrative remains fixated on the coronavirus, and concerns that it might not prove as transitory as some believe, in addition to its becoming more of a global issue. However, crude traded firmer, breaking away from its equity correlation, as desks become more bullish on oil, noting 2020’s weakness as overdone; note, OPEC delegates reported that the group was now considering scrapping plans of an early OPEC+ meeting, keeping the original March 4-5 dates instead.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>China's Hubei province reported 4,823 new coronavirus cases and 116 additional deaths as of February 13th vs. the prior day’s 14,840 additional cases and 242 deaths. Furthermore, China’s reported total coronavirus cases is now at 63,851 and death toll at 1380, while 6,723 patients have been discharged. The city of Wuhan, the origin of nCoV, announced it further tightened its quarantine measures, where residents must now stay at home, except for medical care and key services. China is reportedly looking for plasma donors to develop a treatment for the coronavirus according to the NY Times. Furthermore, other reports noted comments from the President of the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, that therapy for the nCoV which involves the plasma of recovered patients, has started to show effects including a decline in indicators of inflammation and a hike in lymphocytes among other favourable turns. Meanwhile, Global Times tweeted that Thursday's plunge in daily reports of confirmed coronavirus cases in Hubei does not indicate an optimistic situation in the province citing an analyst.</p><p><strong>* CHINESE DIPLOMAT WANG YI: </strong>said China is focused on implementing Phase 1 trade deal with the US; as Phase 1 is implemented, China will consider starting Phase 2. Yi added that US travel restrictions will \"objectively\" bring difficulties implementing the Phase 1 deal. Furthermore, China does not understand why the US is targeting Huawei, no credible evidence Huawei has a backdoor that harms US security. The diplomat said the nCoV epidemic is overall under control and some countries overreacted to the outbreak. Hopes the US will not take unnecessary restrictions on trade and people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING/INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT:</strong> US manufacturing output fell 0.1% M/M in January, in line with the expected; industrial production fell 0.3% M/M, deeper than the -0.2% consensus, while capacity utilisation pared to 76.8% from 77.0%. Capital Economics said the data was hit by the 737 Max production shut down at Boeing, although underlying conditions point to an improvement. The headline was almost entirely driven by the 7.4% M/M decline in aircraft production, but taking this out of the equation, manufacturing output would have risen by 0.3% in the month. Excluding the impact of the shutdown of the 737 Max production at Boeing, manufacturing output increased by 0.3% m/m, driven by a strong gain in autos and a solid rise in computers and electronics. \"That non-aircraft gain echoes the message from the recent manufacturing surveys that underlying conditions in the sector are starting to improve,\" CapEco says, \"the coronavirus disruption in China will probably cause some knock-on hit to US firms via the supply chain effects. But once that disruption fades, the manufacturing sector should return to modest growth in the second half of the year.\"</p><p><strong>* UNI OF MICHIGAN SURVEY PRELIM. (FEB):</strong> Another decent report saw the headline surprise to the upside, printing 100.9 from 99.8, which some desks said suggests that higher stock markets are offsetting any coronavirus fears. The expectations component also jumped (92.6 from 90.5), though current conditions did ease (113.8 from 114.4). \"With stock markets close to record highs and gasoline prices falling, expectations could even rise further over the coming month or two,\" Capital Economics said, \"there is no evidence that the coronavirus has hit confidence, presumably because there have been only a few isolated cases in the US.\" Meanwhile, the one-year inflation gauge was unchanged at 2.5%, though the 5-10 year measure eased to 2.3% from 2.5%.</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES (JAN): </strong>Headline retail sales rose 0.3% M/M in January, in line with the expected, though the prior was lowered by one-tenth to 0.2%; the control group measure was unchanged, missing the consensus 0.3%. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the culprit dragging on the control number was the clothing component. \"Our own version of the core, which removes only autos, gas and food from the headline, rose 0.4% in January, after a 0.5% increase in December,\" PM writes, \"these gains more than reversed the 0.6% cumulative decline over the previous three months, which suffered from the imposition of tariffs on an array of imported Chinese consumer goods, effective September 1.\" The consultancy says that the Dec/Jan gains in core sales are consistent with the strength of the Redbook survey, which it says is the best guide to the underlying trend, now that the tariff distortions have been absorbed; it also notes that similar gains in Feb/Mar would generate a 4.25% annualised increase in Q1, which would be in line with income growth and a clear turnaround from the 0.5% decline in Q4. \"In short, we are not perturbed by the flat M/M control measure in Jan, and the downward revisions, which will shave 0.1% from Q4 GDP growth, are disappointing, but they don’t change the big picture: The consumer is fine.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s Mester </strong>(voter) on monetary policy said it<strong> </strong>is in a good place while she reiterated the Fed's guidance that unless there is a material change to the outlook, policy will remain the same and in line with many other FOMC members, stated she is not a fan of negative rates for the US. On the economy, she stated she<strong> </strong>does not believe the expansion is tiring, whilst being positive on the US consumer. She noted there are signs of manufacturing stabilising, familiar to comments from Powell who noted it appears the manufacturing sector had bottomed out, noting her manufacturing contacts do not see something about to fall off a cliff. Mester believes inflation will hit 2% at the end of this year or early next year and on growth, noted the coronavirus is a risk but it has not marked down her 2020 forecast because of the coronavirus. “It is too early to see whether Phase One will see a pick-up in business investment”, she added, noting uncertainty has reduced following the Phase One deal. On the repo-operations she reiterated it is not QE, and neither are the treasury bill purchases.</p><p><strong>* EZ/GERMAN GDP FLASH (Q4): </strong>M/M was in line with estimates at 0.1%, picking up from the prior 0%, whereas the Y/Y was slightly soft at 0.9% growth, missing expectations for 1% growth. The data followed Germany’s GDP figures which saw the economy stagnate in Q4, although the previous was revised to 0.3% from 0.2%, whereas Y/Y ticked up 0.4%, from the prior revised 0.6%.<strong> </strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics highlight German GDP was disappointingly weak but note that “growth in Germany has slumped to around zero in the past three quarters, more-or-less in line with the headline surveys”. The consultancy concludes that “the January surveys were optimistic, though still weak overall, but now the coronavirus hit looms.”</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 0.63 HIGHER AT USD 52.05/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLED USD 0.98 HIGHER AT USD 57.32/BBL. </strong>The crude complex continued its move higher to end the week in lack of major updates, with desks noting more technical factors at play. Oil prices surged higher in the European session, making new February highs, where reasons being cited included growing expectations that Russia would come on board with OPEC+ cuts, greater confidence that the nCoV is transitory, and that the strong sell off in energy so far in 2020 has been overdone. Additionally, book squaring likely had some impact on tape action ahead of the weekend - posing potential risks regarding nCoV – as well as WTI March contracts option expiries. Meanwhile, the latest Baker Hughes rig count saw oil drillers add 2 rigs to 678 and natgas drillers cut 1 rig to 110. Drillers added oil rigs for the second consecutive week. Post settlement it was reported that OPEC delegates suggested OPEC+ is mulling cancelling plans for an emergency earlier meeting, keeping the March 5-6 dates instead.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-31+: </strong>The TPLEX bull flattened on Friday as participants took a more risk averse stance ahead of the weekend. The bid gained traction from early European trade, with the 10-year yield finding its lows at 1.573%, remaining nearby till settlement. After a few sessions of T-Note selling, the bid today is likely part due to some position squaring, mediocre data, as well as traders looking to cut their risk exposure over the weekend, where the known unknown is whether the nCoV will escalate further, pressing more fears of pandemic rather than the current epidemic. Additionally, following the duration-heavy supply from the Treasury in the past few sessions, the selling pressure (exacerbated by dealer hedging) will have subsided. By settlement, the whole curve was flatter, seeing the 2s10s narrow by 1.5bps, leaving the 10-year yield at 1.59%. One desk highlights that the 10-year yield has now settled higher for the third straight weekly close, nodding to an easing of concerns.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> SPX +0.16% at 3379, DJIA -0.09% at 29,398, NDX +0.29% at 9,624. <strong>SECTORS</strong>: Cons Disc -0.17%, Cons Stpl +0.28%, Energy -0.81%, Financials +0.08%, Health +0.13%, Industrials -0.06%, Materials +0.06%, Real Estate +1.11%, Technology +0.49%, Communication Svs +0.1%, Utilities +0.65%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Nvidia (NVDA)<strong> </strong>reported figures last night which saw EPS and revenue beats and solid guidance. NVDA reported solid gaming revenue also which led to RBC raising AMD (AMD) PT to a street high of USD 66, due to strong demand for gaming chips. Roku (ROKU) surged after reporting top and bottom-line beats while active accounts rose 36% Y/Y and its streaming hours in Q4 of 40.3bln. Expedia (EXPE) outperformed following an EPS beat and was bullish on its EBITDA forecasts for the year. Elsewhere, software firms Datadog (DDOG) and Cloudflare (NET) traded negative following earnings.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>United Airlines (UAL) announced it delayed the return of the 737 MAX to September 4th, weighing on Boeing (BA). Southwest Airlines (LUV) machinists union stated it has invoked its right to mediation to resolve contract dispute following two years of negotiations.<strong> </strong>eBay (EBAY) was firmer after it announced the acquisition of StubHub has been completed, which impacted its revenue guidance, however, it increased its share repurchase programme to USD 4.5bln from USD 1.5bln, which saw eBay provide better than expected EPS guidance. Tesla (TSLA) priced its 2.67mln secondary shares at USD 767, whilst separate reports noted the automaker is recalling 3k Model X vehicles in China. The information reported at the close last night that Facebook (FB) has released a new app which largely resembles Pinterest (PINS), weighing on the photo-sharing platform. Royal Caribbean (RCL) announced it expects to take a USD 0.65/shr impact due to the coronavirus.<strong> </strong>Of note for Semiconductors, WSJ reported the US Pentagon has dropped its opposition to tightening Chinese company's access to shipments from US chipmakers (SOX, QCOM, INTC, AMD), citing people familiar with the matter. This was followed this reports that GOP Senator Rick Scott proposed a bill to restrict US sales to Huawei, cutting the minimum requirement of US made parts from 25% to 10% in its products.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: USD </strong>It remains to be seen whether the DXY is able to maintain 99.000+ status in wake of underwhelming US data in the form of retail sales, ip and manufacturing output, but from a chart perspective the index needs to sign off above 98.885 (Fib retracement level) to retain a bullish bias and keep its winning run going, while a broadly upbeat Michigan sentiment survey may provide some traction. In truth, the Dollar’s latest rally within a 98.599-99.166 wtd range has owed more to the misfortune of others than anything else given no real impetus from CPI metrics or either semi-annual testimonies/Q&amp;A sessions by Fed chair Powell. Back to technicals, 99.249 forms the first line of resistance and protects the 2019 peak at 99.667.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>In contrast to the Greenback, bearish impulses have intensified for the single currency and especially after Eurozone national ip misses manifested in the pan release to push the Euro down through a series of key supports/psychological levels, like 1.0941, 1.0900, 1.0879, 1.0864 and 1.0850. Moreover, political uncertainty and short positioning against costlier funding currencies continued to weigh, though Eur/Usd and Eur/Gbp found some Valentines Day affection to recoup lost ground from 1.0828 and 0.8296 lows with the aid of not as soft as forecast or feared Q4 GDP prints. However, the omens still look bleak unless the headline pair can reclaim 1.0864 as it languishes some 100 pips under the 1.0957 weekly peak and the cross closer to 2 big figures from best levels circa 0.8504.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Another topsy-turvy week for Sterling and particularly Thursday’s session that was not expected to be volatile in terms of the UK agenda. Indeed, Tuesday was the day for domestic data and the Pound was not disappointed when Q4 GDP beat on a y/y basis and the economy grew more than expected in December m/m, albeit with some post-GE Boris bounce vigour. Cable extended gains back on the 1.2900 handle in response, but the real boon came amidst PM Johnson’s Cabinet reshuffle and a totally unforeseen or envisaged change of Chancellor. To recap, the incumbent Javid was given a conditional offer to keep the top Treasury job, but only if he removed all his advisors and resigned instead leaving the role vacant for Sunak who was being groomed for the post and is said to be more prepared to spend in line with Bojo and his wing man Dominic Cummings. Cable subsequently breached 1.3000, a 1.3025 DMA and 1.3050, but failed/faded after a couple of attempts to clear 1.3070 (February 5 apex) and is only just keeping its head above 1.3000.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/CAD/AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK: </strong>The renowned safe-havens have been pretty subdued between 110.13-109.57 and 0.9818-0.9741 parameters vs the Buck, as the Yen and Franc to a lesser degree were mainly hostage to swings in risk sentiment on the back of unfolding Chinese coronavirus developments. Nevertheless, the Yen (and Gold) is on course to net a gain, while the Franc is faring better against the Euro in a 1.0713-1.0610 band. Conversely, the so called risk, high betas have endured, if not always enjoyed more volatile weeks with the Kiwi troughing around 0.6380 and peaking just shy of 0.6490 after the RBNZ kept rates on hold and sent a clear neutral policy message leaning towards a mildly tighter bias by the end of its OCR projection horizon via a 1.1% rate for mid-2021 compared to 0.9% at the end of Q1 next year previously. In similar vein, the Riksbank maintained its benchmark repo at 0%, but signalled no change for the foreseeable future and almost rolled out the same assessment as it did at the December policy meet, verbatim, albeit with no Board dissent vs 2 dovish reservations last time. Eur/Sek currently near the middle of a 10.5890-4750 range and lagging Eur/Nok at fresh lows just under 10.0200 from 10.1930+ at the other extreme on firmer oil prices and specifically significantly stronger than forecast Norwegian inflation data. Back to the non-US Dollars, the Aussie has rebounded on the coattails of its Antipodean peer, but also on the back of an acceleration in demand for mortgages plus RBA Governor Lowe underlining a wait-and-see policy stance and no haste to try and get CPI back on target. Similar sentiments via BoC’s Poloz stressing the adverse effect/risk of easing in the near term, and the Loonie also gleaned support from the rebound in crude.</p><p><strong>EM: </strong>Very lively trade for many regional currencies, as the Yuans pivoted 7.0000 after weakening on revised standards for diagnosing COVID-19 cases (new classification for nCoV) ramped up the number of those contaminated in the Hubei epicentre. Meanwhile, the Lira continued to markedly underperform largely due to Turkey’s Syrian conflict and heightened tensions with Russia that offset official intervention via tighter FX bank swap limits, but the Real rallied off record lows after direct BCB intervention and the Rand drew support from no Eskom load-shedding. Brent’s revival boosted the Rouble and the Mexican Peso strengthened after the Banxico eased 25 bp, but the Central Bank Governor pre-announced upgrades to inflation estimates in the forthcoming February 26 report.</p>",

The bid gained traction from early European trade, with the 10-year yield finding its lows at 1.573%, remaining nearby till settlement. After a few sessions of T-Note selling, the bid today is likely part due to some position squaring, mediocre data, as well as traders looking to cut their risk exposure over the weekend, where the known unknown is whether the nCoV will escalate further, pressing more fears of pandemic rather than the current epidemic. Additionally, following the duration-heavy supply from the Treasury in the past few sessions, the selling pressure (exacerbated by dealer hedging) will have subsided. By settlement, the whole curve was flatter, seeing the 2s10s narrow by 1.5bps, leaving the 10-year yield at 1.59%. One desk highlights that the 10-year yield has now settled higher for the third straight weekly close, nodding to an easing of concerns.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>It remains to be seen whether the <strong>DXY</strong> is able to maintain 99.000+ status in wake of underwhelming US data in the form of retail sales, ip and manufacturing output, but from a chart perspective the index needs to sign off above 98.885 (Fib retracement level) to retain a bullish bias and keep its winning run going, while a broadly upbeat Michigan sentiment survey may provide some traction. In truth, the Dollar’s latest rally within a 98.599-99.166 wtd range has owed more to the misfortune of others than anything else given no real impetus from CPI metrics or either semi-annual testimonies/Q&amp;A sessions by Fed chair Powell. Back to technicals, 99.249 forms the first line of resistance and protects the 2019 peak at 99.667.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Greenback, bearish impulses have intensified for the single currency and especially after Eurozone national ip misses manifested in the pan release to push the Euro down through a series of key supports/psychological levels, like 1.0941, 1.0900, 1.0879, 1.0864 and 1.0850. Moreover, political uncertainty and short positioning against costlier funding currencies continued to weigh, though Eur/Usd and Eur/Gbp found some Valentines Day affection to recoup lost ground from 1.0828 and 0.8296 lows with the aid of not as soft as forecast or feared Q4 GDP prints. However, the omens still look bleak unless the headline pair can reclaim 1.0864 as it languishes some 100 pips under the 1.0957 weekly peak and the cross closer to 2 big figures from best levels circa 0.8504.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another topsy-turvy week for Sterling and particularly Thursday’s session that was not expected to be volatile in terms of the UK agenda. Indeed, Tuesday was the day for domestic data and the Pound was not disappointed when Q4 GDP beat on a y/y basis and the economy grew more than expected in December m/m, albeit with some post-GE Boris bounce vigour. Cable extended gains back on the 1.2900 handle in response, but the real boon came amidst PM Johnson’s Cabinet reshuffle and a totally unforeseen or envisaged change of Chancellor. To recap, the incumbent Javid was given a conditional offer to keep the top Treasury job, but only if he removed all his advisors and resigned instead leaving the role vacant for Sunak who was being groomed for the post and is said to be more prepared to spend in line with Bojo and his wing man Dominic Cummings. Cable subsequently breached 1.3000, a 1.3025 DMA and 1.3050, but failed/faded after a couple of attempts to clear 1.3070 (February 5 apex) and is only just keeping its head above 1.3000.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/CAD/AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The renowned safe-havens have been pretty subdued between 110.13-109.57 and 0.9818-0.9741 parameters vs the Buck, as the Yen and Franc to a lesser degree were mainly hostage to swings in risk sentiment on the back of unfolding Chinese coronavirus developments. Nevertheless, the Yen (and Gold) is on course to net a gain, while the Franc is faring better against the Euro in a 1.0713-1.0610 band. Conversely, the so called risk, high betas have endured, if not always enjoyed more volatile weeks with the Kiwi troughing around 0.6380 and peaking just shy of 0.6490 after the RBNZ kept rates on hold and sent a clear neutral policy message leaning towards a mildly tighter bias by the end of its OCR projection horizon via a 1.1% rate for mid-2021 compared to 0.9% at the end of Q1 next year previously. In similar vein, the Riksbank maintained its benchmark repo at 0%, but signalled no change for the foreseeable future and almost rolled out the same assessment as it did at the December policy meet, verbatim, albeit with no Board dissent vs 2 dovish reservations last time. Eur/Sek currently near the middle of a 10.5890-4750 range and lagging Eur/Nok at fresh lows just under 10.0200 from 10.1930+ at the other extreme on firmer oil prices and specifically significantly stronger than forecast Norwegian inflation data. Back to the non-US Dollars, the Aussie has rebounded on the coattails of its Antipodean peer, but also on the back of an acceleration in demand for mortgages plus RBA Governor Lowe underlining a wait-and-see policy stance and no haste to try and get CPI back on target. Similar sentiments via BoC’s Poloz stressing the adverse effect/risk of easing in the near term, and the Loonie also gleaned support from the rebound in crude.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Very lively trade for many regional currencies, as the Yuans pivoted 7.0000 after weakening on revised standards for diagnosing COVID-19 cases (new classification for nCoV) ramped up the number of those contaminated in the Hubei epicentre. Meanwhile, the Lira continued to markedly underperform largely due to Turkey’s Syrian conflict and heightened tensions with Russia that offset official intervention via tighter FX bank swap limits, but the Real rallied off record lows after direct BCB intervention and the Rand drew support from no Eskom load-shedding. Brent’s revival boosted the Rouble and the Mexican Peso strengthened after the Banxico eased 25 bp, but the Central Bank Governor pre-announced upgrades to inflation estimates in the forthcoming February 26 report.</p>",

(+0.4%) </strong>were kept afloat but with early indecision in the mainland due to the outbreak and with the rumour mill rife including reports that China is considering postponing its annual parliamentary meeting, as well as a tweet that Shanghai is banning all people and cars entering the city which was uncorroborated and later deleted.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European bourses are lacklustre this morning (Stoxx 50 U/C) with little in the way of over/underperformers thus far. Newsflow has been very limited, with opening movers earnings driven; similarly, sectors are mixed/flat aside from utilities which received a valentines gift from EDF’s (+8.0%) stellar earnings. Sticking with the CAC on earnings where Renault (+3.0%) metrics were mixed, but most notably they significantly cut their dividend by over EUR 2.00/shr as well as downbeat guidance which does not take into account the coronavirus. However, Co. shares have reversed course from a downbeat during their subsequent earnings call on interim CEO remarks. Turning to the FTSE 100 (+0.1%) which has had, compared to other bourses, a marginally more eventful morning driven by some mild Sterling choppiness after yesterday’s Chancellor induced surge. Individual UK movers are also earnings driven, with earnings from AstraZeneca (U/C) who missed on revenue and EPS while RBS (-6.0%) beat on operating profit but this was not enough to overcome projected negative impacts from regulation changes as well as planned balance sheet reductions. Additionally, they are to re-name themselves as Natwest Group this year, which isn’t too surprising as circa. 80% of RBS’ clients joined through the Natwest brand.</p><p>China's auto sales are likely to fall in excess in H120 due to the coronavirus, could be as low as 5% for the period should the virus be under control prior to April, according to the Industry Association. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> Still out of favour in the G10 arena, but the single currency has regained some composure after extending losses across the board and perhaps deriving a degree of comfort from preliminary German Q4 GDP just evading contraction plus broadly firmer than forecast pan Eurozone prints alongside employment readings. Eur/Usd has clawed back from deeper sub-1.0900 lows after arresting its slide just above the next line of technical support ahead of 1.0800 around 1.0821, while Eur/Gbp has defended 0.8300 again. However, the headline pair needs to reclaim Fib retracement levels over 1.0850 to really become loved again.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> Amidst extremely narrow confines vs most major counterparts, the Dollar remains largely dependent on others for direction ahead of a raft of US data including retail sales and ip in advance of preliminary Michigan sentiment having derived little if any independent impetus via Thursday’s CPI metrics. Hence, the DXY is still tethered to the 99.000 anchor, albeit after inching to another fresh 2020/multi-month apex at 99.166 and slightly closer to next upside chart hurdle protecting last year’s peak (99.249 and 99.667 respectively).</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/GBP/JPY/NZD/CHF -</strong> The Loonie and Franc are marginal outliers flanking the aforementioned tightly bound trade against the Greenback, as Usd/Cad breaks below 1.3250 more convincingly against the backdrop of firmer oil prices that are also helping the NOK pare losses vs the recovering Eur more than the SEK.

Newsflow has been very limited, with opening movers earnings driven; similarly, sectors are mixed/flat aside from utilities which received a valentines gift from EDF’s (+8.0%) stellar earnings. Sticking with the CAC on earnings where Renault (+3.0%) metrics were mixed, but most notably they significantly cut their dividend by over EUR 2.00/shr as well as downbeat guidance which does not take into account the coronavirus. However, Co. shares have reversed course from a downbeat during their subsequent earnings call on interim CEO remarks. Turning to the FTSE 100 (+0.1%) which has had, compared to other bourses, a marginally more eventful morning driven by some mild Sterling choppiness after yesterday’s Chancellor induced surge. Individual UK movers are also earnings driven, with earnings from AstraZeneca (U/C) who missed on revenue and EPS while RBS (-6.0%) beat on operating profit but this was not enough to overcome projected negative impacts from regulation changes as well as planned balance sheet reductions. Additionally, they are to re-name themselves as Natwest Group this year, which isn’t too surprising as circa. 80% of RBS’ clients joined through the Natwest brand.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> Still out of favour in the G10 arena, but the single currency has regained some composure after extending losses across the board and perhaps deriving a degree of comfort from preliminary German Q4 GDP just evading contraction plus broadly firmer than forecast pan Eurozone prints alongside employment readings. Eur/Usd has clawed back from deeper sub-1.0900 lows after arresting its slide just above the next line of technical support ahead of 1.0800 around 1.0821, while Eur/Gbp has defended 0.8300 again. However, the headline pair needs to reclaim Fib retracement levels over 1.0850 to really become loved again.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> Amidst extremely narrow confines vs most major counterparts, the Dollar remains largely dependent on others for direction ahead of a raft of US data including retail sales and ip in advance of preliminary Michigan sentiment having derived little if any independent impetus via Thursday’s CPI metrics. Hence, the DXY is still tethered to the 99.000 anchor, albeit after inching to another fresh 2020/multi-month apex at 99.166 and slightly closer to next upside chart hurdle protecting last year’s peak (99.249 and 99.667 respectively).</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/GBP/JPY/NZD/CHF -</strong> The Loonie and Franc are marginal outliers flanking the aforementioned tightly bound trade against the Greenback, as Usd/Cad breaks below 1.3250 more convincingly against the backdrop of firmer oil prices that are also helping the NOK pare losses vs the recovering Eur more than the SEK.

The TPLEX found a leg higher on the sudden spike higher in nCoV cases and deaths reported out of China due to the altering of their methodology. However, yields found their lows in early European trade, alongside risk appetite, paring back most of the prior move lower through the session. A couple of factors were being cited for the reversal, one being that some drew attention to the increased reported cases being a technical adjustment that is more backward looking, supporting the thesis that China now has the virus well contained. Others cited the Gilt sell-off in the UK, following Chancellor Javid announcing his resignation, as weighing on the TPLEX and EGBs. Additionally, a slew of IG corporate issuance, including a jumbo USD 9.25bln 6-parter from Carrier Global, in addition to anticipation of the 30-year Bond auction, weighed on Fixed Income heading into the US session. The 30-year Bond auction gave some impetus behind the underlying’s bid in the later part of the session, stopping through the 2.061% WI by 0.7bps to mark the lowest ever 30-year auction, covered by 2.43x (vs six-auction avg. 2.32), while the takedown indicated strong demand as both directs and indirects took more than their averages as dealers took less. The strong auction saw the entire curve flatten by settlement, with the 30-year yield lower by 2bps and the 2yr unchanged. US T-note futures (H20) settled 2+ ticks higher at 130-24+.</p><p><strong>NY Fed cut Overnight Repo Operations limit to USD 100bln (Prev. 120bln) starting today and cut Tuesday and Thursday Term repos to USD 25bln (Prev. 30bln) for February and again to USD 20bln for March, while NY Fed maintained monthly Treasury Bill purchases at USD 60bln through mid-March.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Williams (Voter, Neutral)</strong> thinks the economy is in a 'very, very good place'.

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;Asia equity markets are mostly higher following the near recovery seen on Wall St and with some coronavirus fears abating after the latest update from the epicentre of the outbreak showed a slowdown of the daily additional cases to 4823 and deaths at 116 vs. the prior day’s 14840 surge in new cases and 242 increase in deaths. ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with financials resuming their recent earnings-driven outperformance but with gains capped by weakness in gold miners and amid concerns of potential ramifications after Australia extended the ban on foreign nationals travelling from its largest trading partner China. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is the laggard with attention fixated on a slew of earnings including Nissan which dropped by almost double-digits after the automaker’s 9-month net fell around 90%, while it lowered its FY net guidance and announced no year-end dividend. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) are kept afloat but with mainland indecisive amid the ongoing uncertainty due to the outbreak and with the rumour mill rife including reports that China is considering postponing its annual parliamentary meeting, as well a tweet that Shanghai is banning all people and cars entering the city which was uncorroborated and later deleted.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback continues make headway above the 99.00 level albeit a gradual pace after the mixed US CPI figures failed to provide a catalyst, although it has benefitted from recent declines in EUR/USD which slumped to its weakest level since April 2017. GBP/USD is steady around 1.3050 and holds on to gains in the aftermath of PM Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle and shock resignation of Sajid Javid as Chancellor, with his successor Rishi Sunak seen to be more inclined to additional fiscal spending. Elsewhere, USD/JPY consolidates due to the mixed risk sentiment which alongside a light overnight calendar, has kept antipodeans rangebound with AUD/USD and NZD/USD remaining close to their 200-Hour MA levels at 0.6720 and 0.6444 respectively.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid the overnight indecision and after prices found a base at the 152.50 level, while participants are also sidelined ahead of an enhanced-liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p>",
