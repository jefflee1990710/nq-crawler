Financials and energy led gains (the former being supported by M&amp;A chatter and the Fed’s pushback of negative rates, while the latter supported after this week’s crude draws). Earlier downside was attributed to US President Trump’s wide-ranging morning interview where the tone was punchy, but the President added little new information to the narrative; others note that the losses in seen in the last couple of days have not been driven by a ‘specific’ headline, it seems to be a combination of a few themes playing out; and accordingly, the upside can be framed as the opposite (moves higher on low moves); either way, the 2,800-2,850 region seems to be the battleground to watch in SPX. Cisco (CSCO) beat on EPS and revenue while guidance was also solid, several banks raised their PT’s post-earnings, noting how results were better than feared, while Wells Fargo complemented its business model. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) saw a heavy loss per share, worse than expectations, revenue was in line with expectations. NCLH expects to see a net loss in Q2 while it reiterated it is seeing demand for cruises in Q4 through to 2021, but it expects to see operating costs of USD 70-110mln a month during sail suspensions. Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) deal is to be decided in upcoming days although UBER appears to refuse any change to the 1.9 ratio offer, according to CNBC. A Trendforce article states that DRAM suppliers (MU, SSNLF) drew down inventories in Q1, which allowed them to raise average selling prices. But due to the logistical challenges from the lockdown, shipments fell, which has dragged quarterly DRAM revenue lower by 4.6% Q/Q. US President Trump is reportedly looking into Chinese corporates (BIDU, BABA, JD) listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. 3M (MMM) sales fell 11% to USD 2.3bln while its CFO noted mask sales could contribute to 3% of total Q2 company growth. Boeing (BA) was awarded a USD 1.97bln Navy contract, although Delta Airlines (DAL) announced it would retire its 777x fleet; DAL said they are to consider further retirements in the future, adding it is burning through USD 50mln a day. FedEx (FDX) has put a cap on how many items retailers can ship from certain locations. Mastercard (MA) saw a slight rebound in credit card use for the two weeks ending May 7th. Intelsat (I) filed for Chapter 11 to allow it to partake in the upcoming government airwaves auction. Amarin Pharmaceuticals (AMRN) Vascepa drug saw a significant reduction in coronary revascularisation in a study. SPX +1.2% at 2852, NDQ +1.1% at 9094, DJIA +1.6% at 23,625.</p><p>Treasuries continued to bull-flatten on Thursday amid fading risk appetite and hunger for yield. By settlement, yields were down between 1-6bps. After two sessions of losses in major US equity bourses, it appeared that the trend was set to continue for a third day following another red open, although bourses managed to claw back losses through the session. Nonetheless, the TPLEX was less convinced by the reversal, and maintained its flattening bias. Note that after the heavy duration supply this week from the Treasury, in addition to corporates and SSAs, there was likely some additional upward pressure for USTs – although next week’s ’20-20-20’ supply looms. Further, FX-hedged yield on Treasuries has become considerately more alluring for international buyers in recent weeks, as USD LIBOR falling dramatically from its March blowout; 3-month USD LIBOR hit highs of over 140bps, despite the Fed cutting to the ZLB, and has since fallen to beneath 40bps, undoubtedly supported by the Fed’s consequent actions in funding markets (swap lines, credit facilities, etc…). ING draws attention to the March portfolio investment flow data from Japan overnight, which albeit somewhat stale, showed USD 5bln worth of UST buying from Japanese players, while USD 2.3bln equivalent worth of EGBs were sold. ING expects a continuation of this trend as USD LIBOR has continued to fall recently, while Euribor has remained “stubbornly high… which should benefit USD assets the most”; it also highlights that the Japanese government’s pension fund has raised its target allocation to foreign bonds, another tailwind. Thus, it is likely that Japanese investors, perhaps maybe other international participants too, had a larger hand in this week’s record Treasury refunding auctions, which given the sheer size, performed remarkably well, with yields falling lower into them. Meanwhile, participants would be well reminded to pay attention to Friday’s week ahead schedule form the NY Fed to see whether or not it will continue to taper its asset purchases. US T-note futures (M0) settled 6+ ticks higher at 139-13+.</p>",

Earlier downside was attributed to US President Trump’s wide-ranging morning interview where the tone was punchy, but the President added little new information to the narrative; others note that the losses in seen in the last couple of days have not been driven by a ‘specific’ headline, it seems to be a combination of a few themes playing out; and accordingly, the upside can be framed as the opposite (moves higher on low moves); either way, the 2,800-2,850 region seems to be the battleground to watch in SPX. Cisco (CSCO) beat on EPS and revenue while guidance was also solid, several banks raised their PT’s post-earnings, noting how results were better than feared, while Wells Fargo complemented its business model. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) saw a heavy loss per share, worse than expectations, revenue was in line with expectations. NCLH expects to see a net loss in Q2 while it reiterated it is seeing demand for cruises in Q4 through to 2021, but it expects to see operating costs of USD 70-110mln a month during sail suspensions. Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) deal is to be decided in upcoming days although UBER appears to refuse any change to the 1.9 ratio offer, according to CNBC. A Trendforce article states that DRAM suppliers (MU, SSNLF) drew down inventories in Q1, which allowed them to raise average selling prices. But due to the logistical challenges from the lockdown, shipments fell, which has dragged quarterly DRAM revenue lower by 4.6% Q/Q. US President Trump is reportedly looking into Chinese corporates (BIDU, BABA, JD) listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. 3M (MMM) sales fell 11% to USD 2.3bln while its CFO noted mask sales could contribute to 3% of total Q2 company growth. Boeing (BA) was awarded a USD 1.97bln Navy contract, although Delta Airlines (DAL) announced it would retire its 777x fleet; DAL said they are to consider further retirements in the future, adding it is burning through USD 50mln a day. FedEx (FDX) has put a cap on how many items retailers can ship from certain locations. Mastercard (MA) saw a slight rebound in credit card use for the two weeks ending May 7th. Intelsat (I) filed for Chapter 11 to allow it to partake in the upcoming government airwaves auction. Amarin Pharmaceuticals (AMRN) Vascepa drug saw a significant reduction in coronary revascularisation in a study. SPX +1.2% at 2852, NDQ +1.1% at 9094, DJIA +1.6% at 23,625.</p><p>Treasuries continued to bull-flatten on Thursday amid fading risk appetite and hunger for yield. By settlement, yields were down between 1-6bps. After two sessions of losses in major US equity bourses, it appeared that the trend was set to continue for a third day following another red open, although bourses managed to claw back losses through the session. Nonetheless, the TPLEX was less convinced by the reversal, and maintained its flattening bias. Note that after the heavy duration supply this week from the Treasury, in addition to corporates and SSAs, there was likely some additional upward pressure for USTs – although next week’s ’20-20-20’ supply looms. Further, FX-hedged yield on Treasuries has become considerately more alluring for international buyers in recent weeks, as USD LIBOR falling dramatically from its March blowout; 3-month USD LIBOR hit highs of over 140bps, despite the Fed cutting to the ZLB, and has since fallen to beneath 40bps, undoubtedly supported by the Fed’s consequent actions in funding markets (swap lines, credit facilities, etc…). ING draws attention to the March portfolio investment flow data from Japan overnight, which albeit somewhat stale, showed USD 5bln worth of UST buying from Japanese players, while USD 2.3bln equivalent worth of EGBs were sold. ING expects a continuation of this trend as USD LIBOR has continued to fall recently, while Euribor has remained “stubbornly high… which should benefit USD assets the most”; it also highlights that the Japanese government’s pension fund has raised its target allocation to foreign bonds, another tailwind. Thus, it is likely that Japanese investors, perhaps maybe other international participants too, had a larger hand in this week’s record Treasury refunding auctions, which given the sheer size, performed remarkably well, with yields falling lower into them. Meanwhile, participants would be well reminded to pay attention to Friday’s week ahead schedule form the NY Fed to see whether or not it will continue to taper its asset purchases. US T-note futures (M0) settled 6+ ticks higher at 139-13+.</p>",

Financials and energy led gains (the former being supported by M&amp;A chatter and the Fed’s pushback of negative rates, while the latter supported after this week’s crude draws). Earlier downside was attributed to US President Trump’s wide-ranging morning interview where the tone was punchy, but the President added little new information to the narrative; others note that the losses in seen in the last couple of days have not been driven by a ‘specific’ headline, it seems to be a combination of a few themes playing out; and accordingly, the upside can be framed as the opposite (moves higher on low moves); either way, the 2,800-2,850 region seems to be the battleground to watch in SPX. Treasuries, meanwhile, bull-flattened amid soggy risk sentiment, crude rides the tailwinds of this week’s inventory draws, and the DXY remains above 100.00, while gold has added to gains above USD 1,700. Initial jobless claims data was a little higher than expected but doesn’t tell us much – next week’s print coincides with the BLS jobs report. Overnight, analysts will be eyeing China activity data.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>US President Trump reiterated his preference for negative rates, saying he strongly believes that the US should implement the policy, though he added that now was a great time to have a strong USD. On China, only adding to tensions, Trump is reportedly ‘looking into’ Chinese companies listed on NYSE and Nasdaq, noting if they trade on US exchanges, he is looking at Chinese companies having to follow US accounting rules. Trump said he is very disappointed with China, and when asked about their relationship he even suggested “we could cut off the whole relationship” and that “[the US would] save USD 500bln”. Meanwhile, China Global Times Chief Editor Hu Xijin tweeted US and China \"increasingly dislike each other, various conflicts are rising, therefore, risk for a military clash is increasing. But meanwhile, they both don't want a war.\"</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>A<strong> </strong>Fed survey showed that 90% of workers who lost their jobs, or were furloughed, were told they could return to their job at some point, although it pointed out that it is difficult to predict how long layoffs would last. Meanwhile, Kashkari (voter, dove) reiterated that a V-shaped recovery is off the table. Furthermore, Kashkari warned that when the 2-month bridge under PPP expires, there will be more bankruptcies.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>BoE's Governor Bailey, when asked on negative rates, stated it is always wise not to rule anything out forever, although it is not something the MPC is currently contemplating. Bailey’s personal view is that it would require an extensive communication exercise; not a linear move. The Governor does not think stimulus would bring on higher inflation. The latest commentary from Bailey is in fitting with comments from BoE’s Broadbent this week.</p><p><strong>ECB:</strong> Villeroy noted how yields and spreads matter, even if the ECB does not target fixed levels; he added the ECB would not allow adverse market dynamics to lead to unjustified rate increases in some countries. Villeroy stated the Eurosystem should be guided by market dynamics and liquidity conditions rather than predetermined volumes of purchases; he added the PEPP programme will be flexible. Elsewhere, the ECB Economic Bulletin saw little to new information as it echoed comments from President Lagarde; it noted given the high uncertainty surrounding the ultimate extent of the economic fallout, growth scenarios produced by ECB staff suggest that euro area GDP could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, depending crucially on the duration of the containment measures and the success of policies to mitigate the economic consequences for businesses and workers.</p><p><strong>BANXICO: </strong>Banxico cut its rate by 50bps as expected to 5.5% in a unanimous decision. The Central Bank expects the impact from the pandemic to intensify in Q2 and expects to see a significant contract of employment. It noted that the balance of risks remains uncertain, although further or persistent MXN depreciation and potential supply chain disruptions are among the upward risks to inflation; note, recent inflation reports have been weak with it trickling away from its target level. Rabobank expects continued easing from Banxico until rates reach 4.5%.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 139-13+</strong></p><p>Treasuries continued to bull-flatten on Thursday amid fading risk appetite and hunger for yield. By settlement, yields were down between 1-6bps. After two sessions of losses in major US equity bourses, it appeared that the trend was set to continue for a third day following another red open, although bourses managed to claw back losses through the session. Nonetheless, the TPLEX was less convinced by the reversal, and maintained its flattening bias. Note that after the heavy duration supply this week from the Treasury, in addition to corporates and SSAs, there was likely some additional upward pressure for USTs – although next week’s ’20-20-20’ supply looms. Further, FX-hedged yield on Treasuries has become considerately more alluring for international buyers in recent weeks, as USD LIBOR falling dramatically from its March blowout; 3-month USD LIBOR hit highs of over 140bps, despite the Fed cutting to the ZLB, and has since fallen to beneath 40bps, undoubtedly supported by the Fed’s consequent actions in funding markets (swap lines, credit facilities, etc…). ING draws attention to the March portfolio investment flow data from Japan overnight, which albeit somewhat stale, showed USD 5bln worth of UST buying from Japanese players, while USD 2.3bln equivalent worth of EGBs were sold. ING expects a continuation of this trend as USD LIBOR has continued to fall recently, while Euribor has remained “stubbornly high… which should benefit USD assets the most”; it also highlights that the Japanese government’s pension fund has raised its target allocation to foreign bonds, another tailwind. Thus, it is likely that Japanese investors, perhaps maybe other international participants too, had a larger hand in this week’s record Treasury refunding auctions, which given the sheer size, performed remarkably well, with yields falling lower into them. Meanwhile, participants would be well reminded to pay attention to Friday’s week ahead schedule form the NY Fed to see whether or not it will continue to taper its asset purchases.</p><p>LIPPER US FUND FLOWS: For the week ending May 13th, Investment-Grade saw net inflows of USD 5.245bln; High Yield saw net inflows of USD 4.485bln. Note, the weekly Fed H.4.1 report will be released later today which will give some insight into how much corporate credit it has purchased amid the launching week of its SMCCF.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 2.27 HIGHER AT USD 27.56; WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 2.20 HIGHER AT USD 27.88; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 1.94 HIGHER AT USD 31.13.</strong></p><p>Crude futures were firmer on Thursday as participants continue to warm to signs of potential rebalancing of the oil market. Sentiment was supported in European trade after the IEA monthly report (see below), which cut its oil demand growth forecast by less than some had feared. Furthermore, IEA chief Birol said we are seeing early signs of a gradual oil market rebalancing, although he caveated that the recently announced cuts are not sufficient. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has cut oil sales by half to the US and Europe–deeper cuts than for Asia–amid output being reduced, sources reported, adding that shipments to some US and European buyers will fall by 60-70%. Petrologistics reported that Iranian oil exports were seen hitting the lowest level on record in April, with no increase seen thus far in May. There could also be some technical/flow-driven factors at play in today’s tape action due to WTI June option expiry, coming ahead of the future contract expiry on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>IEA MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>The IEA cut its 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 690k BPD; decline in oil demand in H1 is not as steep as initially feared (the IEA release seems to be more optimistic than that of OPEC and EIA, who cut their forecasts by 2.23mln BPD and 2.9mln BPD respectively); sees oil market improving amid the drop in production and economies reopening. The agency said global oil supply is set to fall by 12mln BPD in May to a 9yr low of 88mln BPD. Oil demand set to fall 25.2mln BPD in April YY, 21.5mln BPD in May and 13mln BPD in June. Noted that US is set to be the biggest contributor to global supply reductions by year-end.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Jobless claims were lower for a sixth consecutive week, the latest data showed, although it was another week where the print was above the Street’s view (2.98mln vs consensus 2.5mln). Pantheon Macroeconomics said the consensus always appeared ambitious since it implied a significantly faster rate of decline than the -15% per week trend in previous weeks. “That said, we are a bit disappointed by the outturn, which shows claims down only 6.2%; early evidence for this week, in the form of daily data from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, alongside Google search numbers, points to claims falling more quickly again, to about 2,500K, but our mid-June target for the first sub-1M reading has to be pushed back to the end of the month.” The cumulative total since mid-March has now risen to around 36.8mln, and Pantheon says that represents a 34.8mln increase compared to the pre-virus trend. Continuing claims, at 22.8mln, are around 68% of the total number of initial jobless claims from the 14th March period through the latest week, and the consultancy explains that “in other words, few of the people who have lost their jobs as a result of the virus have found new positions; however, it is worth noting “that the proportion of the previous week’s initial claims then appearing in the continuing claims numbers a week later has fallen for seven straight weeks, so hiring is not completely dead,” adding that “presumably, most of the modest upturn is in the states which are starting to re-open.” Note, next week’s data will be the reference period for the May jobs report.</p><p><strong>CANADA MANUFACTURING (MAR.):</strong> Canada Manufacturing sales declined by 9.2%, deeper than the expected fall of 5.7% after a 0.5% gain in February. The fall was led by a 34% drop in Auto sales. Despite it being March data, it shows how dire the situation was given the restrictive measures across the nation. RBC highlights that although the major fall was in auto sales, there were widespread losses across industries, although the only exceptions were rises in food, beverages &amp; tobacco and paper manufacturers. The data is consistent with a 9% fall in GDP, inline with Statscan estimate, RBC writes, adding the data will likely get significantly worse in April as lockdown measures were in place for the whole month, but afterward it should start to improve as restrictions ease from May. The desk concludes, however, the drop in March and April will still be staggering “and entirely unprecedented in modern measured economic data”.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.2% at 2852, NDQ +1.1% at 9094, DJIA +1.6% at 23,625</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Communications +3.3%, Financials +2.6%, Discretionary +1.3%, Tech +1.3%, Materials +1.2%, Health Care +1.1%, Industrials +1%, Energy +0.9%, Real Estate +0.1%, Staples -0.3%</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Cisco (CSCO) beat on EPS and revenue while guidance was also solid, several banks raised their PT’s post-earnings, noting how results were better than feared, while Wells Fargo complemented its business model. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) saw a heavy loss per share, worse than expectations, revenue was in line with expectations. NCLH expects to see a net loss in Q2 while it reiterated it is seeing demand for cruises in Q4 through to 2021, but it expects to see operating costs of USD 70-110mln a month during sail suspensions.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is set to announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, US amid US concerns of reliance on Asian countries for tech; could be operational by 2023, according to WSJ sources. Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) deal is to be decided in upcoming days although UBER appears to refuse any change to the 1.9 ratio offer, according to CNBC. A Trendforce article states that DRAM suppliers (MU, SSNLF) drew down inventories in Q1, which allowed them to raise average selling prices. But due to the logistical challenges from the lockdown, shipments fell, which has dragged quarterly DRAM revenue lower by 4.6% Q/Q. US President Trump is reportedly looking into Chinese corporates (BIDU, BABA, JD) listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. 3M (MMM) sales fell 11% to USD 2.3bln while its CFO noted mask sales could contribute to 3% of total Q2 company growth. Boeing (BA) was awarded a USD 1.97bln Navy contract, although Delta Airlines (DAL) announced it would retire its 777x fleet; DAL said they are to consider further retirements in the future, adding it is burning through USD 50mln a day. FedEx (FDX) has put a cap on how many items retailers can ship from certain locations. Mastercard (MA) saw a slight rebound in credit card use for the two weeks ending May 7th. Intelsat (I) filed for Chapter 11 to allow it to partake in the upcoming government airwaves auction. Amarin Pharmaceuticals (AMRN) Vascepa drug saw a significant reduction in coronary revascularisation in a study.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The dollar, which has seen tailwinds from Powell’s pushback of NIRP, today rose after US President Trump said it was a “great time for a strong USD”; however, the President also expressed his preference for negative rates (again), although other White House officials have refrained from commenting (Mnuchin, while Hassett respects the Fed independence). Risk sentiment was choppy, with the overhang of rising US/China tensions, though the gradual economic reopening is supporting risk, analysts said, despite lingering worries of cases rising back upwards.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS/HAVENS:</strong> Equities saw choppy price action; the complex was hit in early trade, though the S&amp;P 500 managed to claw back losses; FX appears to be leaning towards a risk-off feel with the dollar bid and cyclicals pressured (ex-CAD), although JPY, CHF &amp; XAU are mixed.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> JPY fell victim to the rising dollar with little changing the narrative from prior days; the overhang of US/China tensions featuring prominently. The reopening of the economy failed to spur any appreciation, although Tokyo and Osaka still remain under restrictive measures. However, further cautious comments from BoJ governor Kuroda were heard (expects the economy to be negative and substantially suppressed in Q1 &amp; Q2, adding there would not be any hesitation to carry out further stimulus if it is needed, noting there are still many tools to use if it is require Kuroda does not believe it is necessary to deepen negative rates).</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency was weighed on by the dollar, while the ECB economic bulletin largely echoed comments from President Lagarde. However, ECB’s Villeroy said yields and spreads are important, even though the ECB does not target fixed levels. The single currency flirted either side of 1.08 although a sell-off in the afternoon saw EURUSD beneath the figure for the remainder of the session.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> In fitting with other cyclicals, GBP was slightly softer amid a rising dollar. BoE Governor Bailey today did not rule out negative rates saying, “it wouldn’t be wise to do so”, although it is not a tool the MPC is currently contemplating.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> Both antipodeans traded weaker although as equities rallied into the close, both caught a bid and entered positive territory. Overnight Aussie Jobs fared worse than expected (-594k, exp. -575k), although the majority of losses were in the part-time component. The unemployment rate however was better than expected (6.2%, exp. 8.3%), although the participation rate collapsed to 63.5% from 66%, also worse than expected. Although the unemployment rate was better than expected, it is still grim, while some who may have lost their job may not be included in the unemployment rate figure if they are not actively seeking work.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> The kiwi initially continued its post RBNZ decline (expanded QE, talk of NIRP), although saw a rally into the close. Last night, Governor Orr noted the expansion of QE to NZD 60bln is a limit, and not a target. Meanwhile its budget was released which was a hefty package largely surrounding COVID which equates to 20% of GDP or USD 62bln for economic support, Westpac writes, noting a significant increase in borrowing will be required over the coming years, but Westpac believes it was necessary to “go hard and go early”. The desk notes this method still hold risk and means future governments will either have to spend less or raise taxes, “which could sap the economy’s dynamism”. Westpac also suggests it implies rates are to stay low for some time (in fitting with RBNZ forward guidance) as if rates were to unexpectedly rise, it will heavily burden future taxpayers.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie was firmer against the buck today, with USDCAD hovering around 1.41, likely finding some support from higher crude prices, while Ontario will be allowing retailers to open with limits on May 19th, while construction and vehicle dealerships are allowed to resume normal operations. The phase one reopening plan has multiple stages and spans across two to four weeks.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>Once again EMFX was mixed, in fitting with overall risk which failed to signal one clear direction, the BRL and MXN traded flat while the Real was unreactive to comments from its Treasury Secretary who noted its primary deficit this year will be around BRL 600bln, or 8% of GDP, but it could reach BRL 700bln (9% of GDP); Almeida is not worried about the size of debt or deficit this year, he adds. MXN saw modest strength after its rate decision, although further strength was seen as risk assets caught a bid heading into the US equity close. Banxico cut rates by 50bps as expected in an unanimous decision (some expected a deeper cut). RUB was firmer in fitting with oil prices. The TRY continues to appreciate while although the Fed and ECB have refrained from offering swipe lines to the CBRT, it is reportedly in talks with Tokyo, London, Beijing and Doha for new funding lines, according to Turkish officials</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Treasuries continued to bull-flatten on Thursday amid fading risk appetite and hunger for yield. By settlement, yields were down between 1-6bps. After two sessions of losses in major US equity bourses, it appeared that the trend was set to continue for a third day following another red open, although bourses managed to claw back losses through the session. Nonetheless, the TPLEX was less convinced by the reversal, and maintained its flattening bias. Note that after the heavy duration supply this week from the Treasury, in addition to corporates and SSAs, there was likely some additional upward pressure for USTs – although next week’s ’20-20-20’ supply looms. Further, FX-hedged yield on Treasuries has become considerately more alluring for international buyers in recent weeks, as USD LIBOR falling dramatically from its March blowout; 3-month USD LIBOR hit highs of over 140bps, despite the Fed cutting to the ZLB, and has since fallen to beneath 40bps, undoubtedly supported by the Fed’s consequent actions in funding markets (swap lines, credit facilities, etc…). ING draws attention to the March portfolio investment flow data from Japan overnight, which albeit somewhat stale, showed USD 5bln worth of UST buying from Japanese players, while USD 2.3bln equivalent worth of EGBs were sold. ING expects a continuation of this trend as USD LIBOR has continued to fall recently, while Euribor has remained “stubbornly high… which should benefit USD assets the most”; it also highlights that the Japanese government’s pension fund has raised its target allocation to foreign bonds, another tailwind. Thus, it is likely that Japanese investors, perhaps maybe other international participants too, had a larger hand in this week’s record Treasury refunding auctions, which given the sheer size, performed remarkably well, with yields falling lower into them. Meanwhile, participants would be well reminded to pay attention to Friday’s week ahead schedule form the NY Fed to see whether or not it will continue to taper its asset purchases.</p><p><strong>LIPPER US FUND FLOWS: </strong>For the week ending May 13th, Investment-Grade saw net inflows of USD 5.245bln; High Yield saw net inflows of USD 4.485bln. Note, the weekly Fed H.4.1 report will be released later today which will give some insight to how much corporate credit it has purchased amid the launching week of its SMCCF.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD: </strong>The dollar, which has seen tailwinds from Powell’s pushback of NIRP, today rose after US President Trump said it was a “great time for a strong USD”; however, the President also expressed his preference for negative rates (again), although other White House officials have refrained from commenting (Mnuchin, while Hassett respects the Fed independence). Risk sentiment was choppy, with the overhang of rising US/China tensions, though the gradual economic reopening is supporting risk, analysts said, despite lingering worries of a cases rising back upwards.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS/HAVENS</strong>: Equities saw choppy price action; the complex was hit in early trade, though the S&amp;P 500 managed to claw back losses; FX appears to be leaning towards a risk-off feel with the dollar bid and cyclicals pressured (ex-CAD), although JPY, CHF &amp; XAU are mixed.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>JPY fell victim to the rising dollar with little changing the narrative from prior days; the overhang of US/China tensions featuring prominently. The reopening of the economy failed to spur any appreciation, although Tokyo and Osaka still remain under restrictive measures. However, further cautious comments from BoJ governor Kuroda were heard (expects the economy to be negative and substantially suppressed in Q1 &amp; Q2, adding there would not be any hesitation to carry out further stimulus if it is needed, noting there are still many tools to use if it is require Kuroda does not believe it is necessary to deepen negative rates).</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency was weighed on by the dollar, while the ECB economic bulletin largely echoed comments from President Lagarde. However, ECB’s Villeroy said yields and spreads are important, even though the ECB does not target fixed levels. The single currency flirted either side of 1.08 although a sell-off in the afternoon saw EURUSD beneath the figure for the remainder of the session.</p><p><strong>GBP: I</strong>n fitting with other cyclicals, GBP was slightly softer amid a rising dollar. BoE Governor Bailey today did not rule out negative rates saying, “it wouldn’t be wise to do so”, although it is not a tool the MPC is currently contemplating.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong>Both antipodeans trade weaker. Overnight Aussie Jobs fared worse than expected (-594k, exp. -575k), although the majority of losses were in the part-time component. The unemployment rate however was better than expected (6.2%, exp. 8.3%), although the participation rate collapsed to 63.5% from 66%, also worse than expected. Although the unemployment rate was better than expected, it is still grim, while some who may have lost their job may not be included in the unemployment rate figure if they are not actively seeking work.</p><p><strong>NZD: </strong>The kiwi continues its post RBNZ decline (expanded QE, talk of NIRP), however last night Governor Orr noted the expansion of QE to NZD 60bln is a limit, and not a target. Meanwhile its budget was released which was a hefty package largely surrounding COVID which equates to 20% of GDP or USD 62bln for economic support, Westpac writes, noting a significant increase in borrowing will be required over the coming years, but Westpac believes it was necessary to “go hard and go early”. The desk notes this method still hold risk and means future governments will either have to spend less or raise taxes, “which could sap the economy’s dynamism”. Westpac also suggests it implies rates are to stay low for some time (in fitting with RBNZ forward guidance) as if rates were to unexpectedly rise, it will heavily burden future taxpayers.</p><p><strong>CAD: </strong>The Loonie was firmer against the buck today, with USDCAD hovering around 1.41, likely finding some support from higher crude prices, while Ontario will be allowing retailers to open with limits on May 19th , while construction and vehicle dealerships are allowed to resume normal operations. The phase one reopening plan has multiple stages and spans across two to four weeks.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>Once again EMFX was mixed, in fitting with overall risk which failed to signal one clear direction, the BRL and MXN traded flat while the Real was unreactive to comments from its Treasury Secretary who noted its primary deficit this year will be around BRL 600bln, or 8% of GDP, but it could reach BRL 700bln (9% of GDP); Almeida is not worried about the size of debt or deficit this year, he adds. MXN saw modest strength after its rate decision, where the Banxico cut rates by 50bps as expected in an unanimous decision (some expected a deeper cut). RUB was firmer in fitting with oil prices. The TRY continues to appreciate while although the Fed and ECB have refrained from offering swipe lines to the CBRT, it is reportedly in talks with Tokyo, London, Beijing and Doha for new funding lines, according to Turkish officials.</p><p><strong>BANXICO:</strong> Banxico cut its rate by 50bps as expected to 5.5% in a unanimous decision. The Central Bank expects the impact from the pandemic to intensify in Q2 and expects to see a significant contract of employment. It noted that the balance of risks remains uncertain, although further or persistent MXN depreciation and potential supply chain disruptions are among the upward risks to inflation; note, recent inflation reports have been weak with it trickling away from its target level. Rabobank expect continued easing from Banxico until rates reach 4.5%.</p>",

Furthermore, IEA chief Birol said we are seeing early signs of a gradual oil market rebalancing, although he caveated that the recently announced cuts are not sufficient. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has cut oil sales by half to the US and Europe–deeper cuts than for Asia–amid output being reduced, sources reported, adding that shipments to some US and European buyers will fall by 60-70%. Petrologistics reported that Iranian oil exports were seen hitting the lowest level on record in April, with no increase seen thus far in May. There could also be some technical/flow-driven factors at play in today’s tape action due to WTI June option expiry, coming ahead of the future contract expiry on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>IEA MONTHLY REPORT:&nbsp;</strong>The IEA cut its 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 690k BPD; decline in oil demand in H1 is not as steep as initially feared (the IEA release seems to be more optimistic than that of OPEC and EIA, who cut their forecasts by 2.23mln BPD and 2.9mln BPD respectively); sees oil market improving amid the drop in production and economies reopening. The agency said global oil supply is set to fall by 12mln BPD in May to a 9yr low of 88mln BPD. Oil demand set to fall 25.2mln BPD in April YY, 21.5mln BPD in May and 13mln BPD in June.

The fall was led by a 34% drop in Auto sales. Despite it being March data, it shows how dire the situation was given the restrictive measures across the nation. RBC highlights that although the major fall was in auto sales, there were widespread losses across industries, although the only exceptions were rises in food, beverages &amp; tobacco and paper manufacturers. The data is consistent with a 9% fall in GDP, inline with Statscan estimate, RBC writes, adding the data will likely get significantly worse in April as lockdown measures were in place for the whole month, but afterwards it should start to improve as restrictions ease from May. The desk concludes however the drop in March and April will still be staggering “and entirely unprecedented in modern measured economic data”.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>It seems more like familiarity rather than contempt, but the run of consecutive multi-million rises in US weekly unemployment claims only held the Dollar up for a while before the <strong>DXY</strong> extended gains beyond 100.000 to post a new mtd high at 100.560. However, the real red flag for Buck bulls was raised by President Trump via a tweet stating that the time is ripe for a strong Greenback in conjunction with disappointment aimed at China again over COVID-19 and the diplomatic row putting Phase 1 of the trade deal in jeopardy. Indeed, he pondered what it might be like if all ties were cut and the Chinese Global Times editor noted a growing dislike on both sides, with various conflicts rising and heightened risk of a military clash that neither desire. The index has subsequently waned, but the <strong>YUAN</strong> remains weaker offshore near 7.1300 vs the PBoC’s 7.0948 Usd/Cny midpoint fix amidst broad risk aversion not helped by no MLF operation to replenish Yuan 200 bn expiring or 20 bp cut in funding rate that most were expecting.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All off worst levels, yet still propping up the G10 table after a bleak Aussie labour report and official forecasts for further devastation ahead, while NZ fiscal support was ramped up to the equivalent of 1/5 total GDP and the Scandi Crowns were ultimately dethroned by the risk-off mood after the Norwegian Krona gleaned some further traction from oil maintaining its recovery momentum in wake of the IEA’s considerably less pessimistic 2020 outlook for crude demand vs OPEC and EIA estimates. Aud/Usd has bounced from around 0.6405, Nzd/Usd held just above 0.5950, Eur/Nok is hovering below 11.0800 following another dip under 11.0000 and Eur/Sek has pared back from 10.6600+.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>Sterling may simply be avoiding the inevitable following a steeper decline to touch sub-1.2200 support circa 1.2166 vs the Dollar as Cable teeters over the latest round number to give way on the sell in May mantra, while Eur/Gbp remains elevated between 0.8870-32 parameters even though the single currency only just stopped short of stops said to be waiting for a break of 1.0775 against the Buck. Nevertheless, the Euro is underperforming relative to the Franc again as the cross inches closer to 1.0500 and Usd/Chf retreats from 0.9755 to the low 0.9700 area. Elsewhere, the Yen remains tethered to 107.00 with safe-haven ventures through unsustainable as US Treasury yields edge off lows and risk-off flows abate somewhat, while the Loonie has eased all and more of its post-Canadian manufacturing sales declines in wake of the BoC’s FSR and Governor Poloz reaffirming that all efforts will be made to keep financial markets functioning.

Similarly, the Mxn remains firm in the run up to Banxico’s expected 50 bp rate cut in contrast to the Brl that is still suffering from political angst on top of coronavirus contagion and got close to 6.0000 again.</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>WHAT’S GOING ON: </strong>There is a mixed feel on Thursday morning; US equities open lower across the board (NDX outperforms again) amid continued punchy US/China rhetoric, with Trump “looking at” US listed Chinese companies. Treasuries are bull-flattening as the post-refunding steepening is unwound and equities come under pressure; the buck is firmer, and seems to be dictating action, buoyed by comments from Trump that “it is a great time to have a strong USD”, and after Fed Chair Powell leaned-back on negative rates Wednesday, and called on fiscal authorities to step up their game. Gold continues to make progress above USD 1,700 having been consolidating in the region this week. Major crude benchmarks are up by around a buck after this week’s inventory drawdowns, but crude is off highs.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors open in negative territory although there is relative outperformance in defensives (staples and Health Care), while Communication services are among the outperformers with the sector buoyed by solid earnings from Cisco (CSCO), who trade with gains of 5%. Technology opens -1%. Energy, Industrials and Materials are leading the losses.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Cisco (CSCO) beat on EPS and revenue while guidance was also solid, a number of banks raised their PT’s post earnings, noting how results were better than feared, while Wells Fargo complemented its business model. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) saw a heavy loss per share, worse than expectations, revenue was in line with expectations. NCLH expects to see a net loss in Q2 while it reiterated it is seeing demand for cruises in Q4 through to 2021, but it expects to see operating costs of USD 70-110mln a month during sail suspensions.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) deal is to be decided in upcoming days although UBER appears to refuse any change to the 1.9 ratio offer, according to CNBC. A Trendforce article states that DRAM suppliers (MU, SSNLF) drew down inventories in Q1, which allowed them to raise average selling prices. But due to the logistical challenges from the lockdown, shipments fell, which has dragged quarterly DRAM revenue lower by 4.6% Q/Q. US President Trump is reportedly looking into Chinese corporates (BIDU, BABA, JD) listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. 3M (MMM) sales fell 11% to USD 2.3bln while its CFO noted mask sales could contribute to 3% of total Q2 company growth. Boeing (BA) was awarded a USD 1.97bln Navy contract, although Delta Airlines (DAL) announced it would retire its 777x fleet; DAL said they are to consider further retirements in the future, adding it is burning through USD 50mln a day. FedEx (FDX) has put a cap on how many items retailers can ship from certain locations. Mastercard (MA) saw a slight rebound in credit card use for the two weeks ending May 7th. Intelsat (I) filed for Chapter 11 to allow it to partake in the upcoming government airwaves auction.</p><p><strong>EQUITY DOWNSIDE:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 has now fallen by 1% for two days in a row, and the VIX on Wednesday rose to weekly highs. While yesterday’s downside was attributed to Fed chair Powell’s pushback on negative rates, as well as unfriendly US/China headlines (more of those this morning), and even negative commentary from influential investors, many are not surprised by what we are seeing despite those developments. As we noted earlier in the week, a collection of factors likely explains the downbeat sentiment; recall, Goldman Sachs on the weekend provided six factors that were likely to weigh on stocks in the short-term (it even said that downside may be seen without a single catalyst sparking the pullback), and it is worth revisiting those: 1) COVID infection rates outside of NY continue to rise, and may accelerate as lockdowns are lifted; 2) the restart process will take time; 3) bank loan loss reserves were built in Q1 based on a jobless rate of around 10% - that rate rose to 14.7% in April, and GS forecasts loan loss provisions will need to rise to USD 115bln in the next four quarters (versus total of USD 46bln in Q1); this may weigh on share repurchase/buybacks plans, shaking a key pillar of support that equities have enjoyed in the last decade; 4) dividends are at risk, and are seen falling further this year, as too are capex plans; 5) tax policy risk around elections; tax reforms in 2017 lowered corporation tax to 18% from 26%, and may become a political issue; 6) US/China risks, a headwind in 2019, are resurfacing.</p><p><strong>WARNINGS OF ANOTHER DRAWDOWN:</strong> RBC expects US equity markets to stay choppy in the months ahead, and sees another significant drawdown. Despite the SPX trading above its year-end target of 2,750, it sees no need to raise the PT; \"It’s possible, though far from certain, that the S&amp;P 500 found a bottom on March 23rd due to unprecedented Fed stimulus and a looming bottoming of the economy, but valuations are stretched again and investor capitulation never occurred, leaving stocks vulnerable to bad news in the coming months.\" The bank notes that while COVID news flow was favourable last month, it sees the tone deteriorating again (themes include evidence of a second wave of infections or disappointing developments on reopening, treatments or vaccines). It also warns of further downgrades to 2021 EPS forecasts and more dividend suspensions (which becomes more likely the longer the pandemic and the drag on the economy lasts); these, RBC argues, reduces the appeal of stocks. The bank also highlights the familiar theme that the economic recovery will be long, slow and uneven. Meanwhile the 2020 election cycle, where a Trump re-election is not guaranteed, also warrants caution, and there are possibilities that trade relations with China will take a turn for the worse. In terms of positioning, RBC says it is “bothered by the fact that capitulation never really occurred among institutional investors or retail investors in March\"; it notes that US equity futures positioning among assets managers never quite made it back to 2016 lows in March, bottoming out instead near December 2018 lows, while retail investor bearishness has been around its worst 2020 levels, but not as bad as it was during the and after the Financial Crisis. RBC says that the lack of capitulation leaves the US equity market vulnerable to bad news. Additionally, US equity futures positioning has started to turn a little bit lower again, the bank says, and retail investor bearishness moved up in last week’s update; \"The latest data points suggest to us that sentiment in both camps is starting to fade again, or at the very least is fragile.\" It maintains a neutral view on Small Cap relative to Large Cap and Growth relative to Value, and in terms of sectors, it remains overweight Utilities (which it calls a reasonably valued defensive, with safer dividends), Health Care (which it still believes is undervalued, and it is its favourite secular growth pick), and Industrials (which is the bank's top recovery play).</p><p><strong>EARNINGS SEASON TRACKER: </strong>JPMorgan’s final Q1 2020 earnings tracker notes that, with nearly 90% of companies having reported in Europe and the US, and 54% in Japan, earnings delivery is weak across regions, in line with the sharp drop in PMIs in the quarter. The bank says EPS is surprising negatively compared to already heavily reduced consensus estimates, by -1% and -3% in the US and Europe, respectively. “This marks the first negative surprise for the US since we started tracking the data,” the bank writes, “and in addition, the proportion of companies beating EPS estimates in the US is at the lowest level in at least 10 years.” That said, it does say that blended Q1 EPS growth is showing signs of inflecting higher, but that follows downgrades of nearly 10% through the quarter, with the current Q1 '20 EPS USD 33.50 versus USD 37.00 at the start of April. “In contrast, the EPS of the previous four reporting seasons, during 2019, ended on average 4% higher vs the starts of the quarter; Europe, meanwhile is coming in lower than the US at -25% Y/Y versus -13% Y/Y. At the sector level, JPM notes that Energy, Financials and most Cyclicals are the laggards, while Defensives are faring better. “Within Defensives, Pharma is printing strong EPS growth in both the US and Europe, and top line growth in the US is still positive in Q1, at +1% Y/Y, though it is much weaker in Europe, at -6% Y/Y.” Additionally, JPM says that another differentiating feature of this season is the significant number of companies that have revised 2020 profit outlooks lower, or withdrawn their guidance altogether; on the other side, the proportion of companies revising guidance higher stands at the lowest since at least 2009, the bank writes.</p>",

Continuing claims, at 22.8mln, are around 68% of the total number of initial jobless claims from the 14th March period through the latest week, and the consultancy explains that “in other words, few of the people who have lost their jobs as a result of the virus have found new positions; however, it is worth noting “that the proportion of the previous week’s initial claims then appearing in the continuing claims numbers a week later has fallen for seven straight weeks, so hiring is not completely dead,” adding that “presumably, most of the modest upturn is in the states which are starting to re-open.”</li><li>Note, next week’s data will be the reference period for the May jobs report.</li></ul>",

Gold has made progress above USD 1,700 having been consolidating in the region this week. Major crude benchmarks are up USD 1.20-1.35 after this week’s inventory drawdowns.</p><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>The rhetoric continues to deteriorate; this morning, China’s Global Times editor (a proxy for the view of the China state itself) said US and China \"increasingly dislike each other, various conflicts are rising, therefore, risk for a military clash is increasing” although both did not want a war. Although subsequent reports have suggested that China is trying to separate \"diplomatic issues\" and \"trade\". Meanwhile, US President Trump reportedly is looking into Chinese companies listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, according to Fox News, adds that he is apparently very disappointed. On the dollar, Trump said it was a great time to have a strong USD, and reiterated his recent view that he “strongly” feels that the US should have negative rates, a policy Fed officials have pushed back on</p><p><strong>JOBLESS CLAIMS AHEAD:</strong> Claims are seen lower for the sixth straight week. Street expects 2.5mln (range: 2mln to 3.1mln); last week’s 3.2mln. topped the 3mln consensus. Continuing claims are expected to print 25.1mln (range: 24mln to 28mln). Full primer <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-weekly-initial-jobless-claims-report-due-at-0830-et-1330-bst-initial-jobless-claims-seen-lower-for-sixth-straight-week-14-05-2020\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>EQUITY DOWNSIDE:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 has now fallen by 1% for two days in a row, and the VIX on Wednesday rose to weekly highs. While yesterday’s downside was attributed to Fed chair Powell’s pushback on negative rates, as well as unfriendly US/China headlines (more of those this morning), and even negative commentary from influential investors, many are not surprised by what we are seeing despite those developments. As we <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/us-pre-market-themes-equity-futures-give-up-early-gains-supply-floodgates-are-open-why-this-rally-is-unloved-this-week-powell-on-wednesday-retail-sales-cpi-11-05-2020\">noted earlier in the week</a>, a collection of factors likely explains the downbeat sentiment; recall, Goldman Sachs on the weekend provided six factors that were likely to weigh on stocks in the short-term (it even said that downside may be seen without a single catalyst sparking the pullback), and it is worth revisiting those: 1) COVID infection rates outside of NY continue to rise, and may accelerate as lockdowns are lifted; 2) the restart process will take time; 3) bank loan loss reserves were built in Q1 based on a jobless rate of around 10% - that rate rose to 14.7% in April, and GS forecasts loan loss provisions will need to rise to USD 115bln in the next four quarters (versus total of USD 46bln in Q1); this may weigh on share repurchase/buybacks plans, shaking a key pillar of support that equities have enjoyed in the last decade; 4) dividends are at risk, and are seen falling further this year, as too are capex plans; 5) tax policy risk around elections; tax reforms in 2017 lowered corporation tax to 18% from 26%, and may become a political issue; 6) US/China risks, a headwind in 2019, are resurfacing.</p><p><strong>WARNINGS OF ANOTHER DRAWDOWN: </strong>RBC expects US equity markets to stay choppy in the months ahead, and sees another significant drawdown. Despite the SPX trading above its year-end target of 2,750, it sees no need to raise the PT; \"It’s possible, though far from certain, that the S&amp;P 500 found a bottom on March 23rd due to unprecedented Fed stimulus and a looming bottoming of the economy, but valuations are stretched again and investor capitulation never occurred, leaving stocks vulnerable to bad news in the coming months.\" The bank notes that while COVID news flow was favourable last month, it sees the tone deteriorating again (themes include evidence of a second wave of infections or disappointing developments on reopening, treatments or vaccines). It also warns of further downgrades to 2021 EPS forecasts and more dividend suspensions (which becomes more likely the longer the pandemic and the drag on the economy lasts); these, RBC argues, reduces the appeal of stocks. The bank also highlights the familiar theme that the economic recovery will be long, slow and uneven. Meanwhile the 2020 election cycle, where a Trump re-election is not guaranteed, also warrants caution, and there are possibilities that trade relations with China will take a turn for the worse. In terms of positioning, RBC says it is “bothered by the fact that capitulation never really occurred among institutional investors or retail investors in March\"; it notes that US equity futures positioning among assets managers never quite made it back to 2016 lows in March, bottoming out instead near December 2018 lows, while retail investor bearishness has been around its worst 2020 levels, but not as bad as it was during the and after the Financial Crisis. RBC says that the lack of capitulation leaves the US equity market vulnerable to bad news. Additionally, US equity futures positioning has started to turn a little bit lower again, the bank says, and retail investor bearishness moved up in last week’s update; \"The latest data points suggest to us that sentiment in both camps is starting to fade again, or at the very least is fragile.\" It maintains a neutral view on Small Cap relative to Large Cap and Growth relative to Value, and in terms of sectors, it remains overweight Utilities (which it calls a reasonably valued defensive, with safer dividends), Health Care (which it still believes is undervalued, and it is its favourite secular growth pick), and Industrials (which is the bank's top recovery play).</p><p><strong>EARNINGS SEASON TRACKER:</strong> JPMorgan’s final Q1 2020 earnings tracker notes that, with nearly 90% of companies having reported in Europe and the US, and 54% in Japan, earnings delivery is weak across regions, in line with the sharp drop in PMIs in the quarter. The bank says EPS is surprising negatively compared to already heavily reduced consensus estimates, by -1% and -3% in the US and Europe, respectively. “This marks the first negative surprise for the US since we started tracking the data,” the bank writes, “and in addition, the proportion of companies beating EPS estimates in the US is at the lowest level in at least 10 years.” That said, it does say that blended Q1 EPS growth is showing signs of inflecting higher, but that follows downgrades of nearly 10% through the quarter, with the current Q1 '20 EPS USD 33.50 versus USD 37.00 at the start of April. “In contrast, the EPS of the previous four reporting seasons, during 2019, ended on average 4% higher vs the starts of the quarter; Europe, meanwhile is coming in lower than the US at -25% Y/Y versus -13% Y/Y. At the sector level, JPM notes that Energy, Financials and most Cyclicals are the laggards, while Defensives are faring better. “Within Defensives, Pharma is printing strong EPS growth in both the US and Europe, and top line growth in the US is still positive in Q1, at +1% Y/Y, though it is much weaker in Europe, at -6% Y/Y.” Additionally, JPM says that another differentiating feature of this season is the significant number of companies that have revised 2020 profit outlooks lower, or withdrawn their guidance altogether; on the other side, the proportion of companies revising guidance higher stands at the lowest since at least 2009, the bank writes.</p>",

President Trump said he was surprised by Dr. Fauci’s comments regarding risks of reopening too soon which is not an acceptable answer and that Fauci wants to play both sides of the equation, while <strong>he also suggested that the House stimulus bill is dead on arrival. (</strong>Newswires)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said it will be a pretty bad quarter but if we open the economy carefully, there will be an improvement in the subsequent quarters, while he added the most of the USD 3tln stimulus is not yet in the economy and that they will spend more money down the road if needed to aid the economy, although not in a rush to do so this week. Mnuchin also commented the House Democrat stimulus bill is not in the spirit of bipartisanship and there is a risk of too much damage to the economy if US waits too long to reopen.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian stocks traded negatively with global risk appetite dampened by ongoing US-China tensions and ongoing questions about reopening efforts</strong>. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.7%)</strong> was led lower by energy and financials after similar underperformance of the sectors stateside and with participants digesting alarming employment data that showed a near-600k decline in jobs. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.7%)</strong> remained under the influence of a firmer currency and with earnings releases also providing a catalyst for price action including Sony. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.5%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%)</strong> were both downbeat as US-China tensions turned up a notch after source reports noted China will soon impose countermeasures on those seeking COVID-19 damages from China and after US President Trump extended the executive order protecting the US supply chain from Huawei and ZTE for an additional year, while the PBoC also disappointed expectations for an MLF announcement and associated 20bps rate cut which both failed to materialize. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as prices benefitted from the risk aversion and gains in T-notes, but with upside later reversed after a mixed 30yr auction which resulted in lower accepted prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day, while it refrained from conducting MLF operations despite CNY 200bln of MLFs expiring today.

UK RICS said 80% of surveyors in its survey have seen people pull out of transactions since the lockdown began, while most surveyors expect house prices to drop when market reopens and recover in an average of 11 months. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Europe has taken the downbeat lead from the APAC session (Euro Stoxx 50 -1.9%)</strong> as rising tensions between US and China continue to weigh on sentiment, whilst Fed Chair Powell’s heavy downplaying of NIRP does not aid the equity complex. Major bouses see broad-based losses with no real stand-out across major indices. Sectors reside firmly in the red across the board with steeper losses seen in cyclicals (ex-telecoms). The sector breakdown sees Auto and Parts alongside Travel &amp; Leisure as the laggards. Telecommunications reside at the top of the list – losses in the sector are cushioned by earrings from Deutsche Telekom (+0.6%) who topped Adj. EBITDA estimates, confirmed guidance, and said the outbreak is having a limited impact on Co’s financials. Sticking with German earnings, Merck (+1.1%) remains underpinned after topping estimates on all Q1 metrics, whilst guidance printed in-line with analyst estimates. Other earnings-related DAX constituents include: Wirecard (-0.7%), RWE (-0.7%). Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (-1.7%) and PSA (-1.1%) are pressured after simultaneously pulling FY20 dividend; the dividend was a component of their merger. Finally, Roche (+0.2%) remains afloat after its COVID-19 antibody test had been approved by Public Health England. Co. is in talks with the NHS and the UK government regarding a phased roll-out of tests as soon as possible. UK government is in negotiations to purchase millions of kits.</p><p><strong>Cisco (CSCO) -</strong> Q3 2020 (USD): Adj EPS 0.79 (exp. 0.69), revenue 12.0bln (exp. 11.7bln).

(Newswires) <i>Co. shares rose 2.3% after-market.</i></p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD - </strong>Not quite role reversal, but the pecking order has changed down under to an extent following a near 600k plunge in Aussie payrolls, a marked rise in the participation rate and predictions for more pronounced jobs market pain to come. Aud/Usd has duly pulled back further from 0.6500+ peaks to pivot 0.6450 and Aud/Nzd is losing momentum below 1.0800 even though the Kiwi remains under pressure post-RBNZ on heightened NIRP expectations and the NZ Government boosting its COVID-19 recovery fund to the tune of 20% of GDP. Indeed, Nzd/Usd has now lost grip of the 0.6000 handle ahead of April’s manufacturing PMI.</p><p><strong>JPY - </strong>The Yen continues to buck the overall trend and outperform an otherwise strong Dollar, with the DXY looking more comfortable above 100.000 within a 100.420-140 range, as risk-off positioning intensifies and keeps Usd/Jpy capped on advances through 107.00. No adverse reaction to more dovish rhetoric from BoJ Governor Kuroda balanced with the unflinching belief that Japan will not return to deflation and it is not necessary to ease benchmark rates further even though recession will continue in Q2.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK - </strong>The Pound continues to fall victim to bearish historical patterns and increasingly negative technical impulses as Cable relinquished another round number at 1.2200 to test deeper support ahead of 1.2150 (circa 1.2166) before finding underlying bids, with perhaps some fundamental weakness emanating from BoE Governor Bailey acknowledging that markets are anticipating more QE. Meanwhile, the aforementioned risk aversion has knocked the Swedish Krona out of its stride and back under 10.6000 vs the Euro, but firm crude prices following a less downbeat IEA monthly report in terms of global demand destruction are helping Eur/Nok in a downward trajectory near 11.0000, albeit off Wednesday’s sub-10.9250 two month lows.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/EUR - </strong>Buoyant oil is also underpinning the Loonie either side of 1.4100 vs its US counterpart in the run up to the BoC’s FSR, while the Franc is back in a bind or divergent position given Usd/Chf holding above 0.9700 in contrast to Eur/Chf edging back down towards 1.0500, as the single currency straddles 1.0800 against the Greenback after light stops were tripped at the big figure, but not larger ones said to be sitting beneath at 1.0775. Note, Eur/Usd is shrouded in a cluster of big option expiries today spanning 1.0750 to 1.0930 – check out the headline feed at 7.23BST for full details and the other major strikes in play.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Not even the deteriorating mood amidst heightened COVID-19 2nd wave and US-China relations or rising crude costs can dent the Try’s ardour it seems, as the Lira remains above 7.0000 and drawing traction currently from hopes that the CBRT can arrange swap lines with foreign peers..</p><p><strong>Australian Employment Change (Apr) -594.3k vs. Exp. -575.0k (Prev. 5.9k) Australian Unemployment Rate (Apr) 6.2% vs. Exp. 8.3% (Prev. 5.2%) Australian Participation Rate (Apr) 63.5% vs. Exp. 65.2% (Prev. 66.0%)</strong></p><p>Australian Bureau of Statistics said underemployment increased by 4.9pts to 13.7% in April and that an unusual number of employed and unemployed leaving the labour force resulted to an unprecedented decline in the participation rate. (Newswires)</p><p>Australian PM Morrison said it has been a tough day for Australia and he knew there would be hard news regarding job losses, while he suggested they must brace for further hard news. There were also comments from Treasurer Frydenberg that the economic numbers will get worse before they get better but noted lifting restrictions will help people return to work. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>RBNZ Governor Orr said the NZD 60bln is a limit and not a target for its QE programme</strong>, while he also noted that monetary policy will play a role by keeping interest rates low for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, <strong>Governor Orr said QE program is the best option for now and that operational challenges still remain for negative interest rates</strong>, while he does not rule out direct purchase of government bonds. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>New Zealand 2020 Budget stated there will be NZD 50bln for COVID-19 response and recovery fund and NZD 4bln in business support package</strong> including targeted wage subsidy extension. New Zealand Budget Balance was seen at a deficit of 32.03B (Prev. -5.15B) and&nbsp; sees 2020/21 cash deficit at 43.3bln vs. Prev. HYEFU forecast of NZD 7.97bln surplus, while it forecasts 2020 GDP at -4.6% vs. HYEFU forecast of 2.3%. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Broad risk sentiment remains bearish, but debt futures have pared back after reaching heady heights early in the EU session with <strong>Bunds </strong>back under 174.00 and <strong>Gilts</strong> only just keeping their noses in front of 138.00. Conversely, equity markets have trimmed some declines, though are still looking prone to bouts of selling pressure and long liquidation after significant retracement and storm clouds gathering again over the coronavirus plus US-China relations. Back to bonds, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> have been largely side-lined and holding a flatter bias even though President Trump continues his NIRP campaign, awaiting initial claims and arch Fed dove Kashkari.</p><p>Major FX Option Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: <strong>1.0750 (1.8BLN), 1.0800 (1.5BLN), </strong>1.0870-80 (900M), <strong>1.0900 (1.4BLN), 1.0905-15 (1.3BLN), 1.0925-30 (1.5BLN)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/GBP: 0.8700 (300M), 0.8750 (540M), <strong>0.8800 (850M)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUD/USD: <strong>0.6350 (1.7BLN),</strong> 0.6400 (725M), <strong>0.6500 (1.1BLN), 0.6550 (1.4BLN)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/JPY: <strong>106.10-25 (1BLN),</strong> 106.75-85 (900M), <strong>107.00-05 (1.2BLN), </strong>107.15-25 (500M), 107.35-40 (500M)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and <strong>Brent </strong>front-month futures remain on the front foot after a somewhat choppy APAC trading session, with fresh modest impetus across the complex derived from the latest IEA oil market report – which proved more optimistic vs. its OPEC and EIA counterparts. The agency cut their 2020 demand growth forecast by 690k BPD (vs OPEC’s 2.23mln BPD and EIA’s 2.9mln BPD) while stating that the decline in H1 oil demand is not as steep as originally feared – with an improvement in the balance seen amid deep production curbs and reopening economies, however, IEA Chief Birol stated that he does not believe the recently announced cuts (i.e Saudi, UAE, and Kuwaiti over-compliance) are enough to balance the markets. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia has reportedly cut oil sales by half to the US &amp; Europe, deeper cuts than for Asia, as output has been reduced, according to sources. Shipments to some US and European buyers will fall by 60-70% vs. normally contracted volumes. This comes in the context of Aramco raising OSPs across the regions, lower sales to Europe and the US could be a function of the lower demand from lockdowns. Aside from that, news-flow has been light for the complex – WTI June resides around session highs north of USD 26/bbl (vs. low 25.18/bbl), whilst Brent July similarly sees itself north of USD 30/bbl (vs. low 28.88/bbl). Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> remains relatively flat north of USD 1700/oz and around the middle of today’s tight USD 1712-1719/oz range awaiting fresh macro stimulus or Dollar action. <strong>Copper prices</strong> meanwhile tracked losses across equities alongside the soured sentiment, and reside in proximity to USD 2.400/lb, having tested support at USD 2.3350/lb earlier in the session.</p><p><strong>IEA cuts 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 690k BPD;</strong> Decline in oil demand in H1 is not as steep as initially feared; sees oil market improving amid the drop in production and economies reopening</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global oil supply set to fall by 12mln BPD in May to a 9yr low of 88mln BPD</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oil demand set to fall 25.2mln BPD in April YY, 21.5mln BPD in May and 13mln BPD in June</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US set to be the biggest contributor to global supply reductions by year-end</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>IEA Head Birol says we are see early signed of gradual oil market rebalancing, but does not believe the recently announced cuts are sufficient to balance the market</strong></p><p>US DoE is to purchase 1mln bbls of oil from small to mid-size producers for the SPR and stated that the purchases will serve as a test of conditions of the physical crude oil available to the reserve, while it noted the purchase of 1mln bbls is far less than the original plan for up to 30mln bbls.

Major bouses see broad-based losses with no real stand-out across major indices. Sectors reside firmly in the red across the board with steeper losses seen in cyclicals (ex-telecoms). The sector breakdown sees Auto and Parts alongside Travel &amp; Leisure as the laggards. Telecommunications reside at the top of the list – losses in the sector are cushioned by earrings from Deutsche Telekom (+0.6%) who topped Adj. EBITDA estimates, confirmed guidance, and said the outbreak is having a limited impact on Co’s financials. Sticking with German earnings, Merck (+1.1%) remains underpinned after topping estimates on all Q1 metrics, whilst guidance printed in-line with analyst estimates. Other earnings-related DAX constituents include: Wirecard (-0.7%), RWE (-0.7%). Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (-1.7%) and PSA (-1.1%) are pressured after simultaneously pulling FY20 dividend; the dividend was a component of their merger. Finally, Roche (+0.2%) remains afloat after its COVID-19 antibody test had been approved by Public Health England. Co. is in talks with the NHS and the UK government regarding a phased roll-out of tests as soon as possible. UK government is in negotiations to purchase millions of kits.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD - Not quite role reversal, but the pecking order has changed down under to an extent following a near 600k plunge in Aussie payrolls, a marked rise in the participation rate and predictions for more pronounced jobs market pain to come. Aud/Usd has duly pulled back further from 0.6500+ peaks to pivot 0.6450 and Aud/Nzd is losing momentum below 1.0800 even though the Kiwi remains under pressure post-RBNZ on heightened NIRP expectations and the NZ Government boosting its COVID-19 recovery fund to the tune of 20% of GDP. Indeed, Nzd/Usd has now lost grip of the 0.6000 handle ahead of April’s manufacturing PMI.</p><p>JPY - The Yen continues to buck the overall trend and outperform an otherwise strong Dollar, with the DXY looking more comfortable above 100.000 within a 100.420-140 range, as risk-off positioning intensifies and keeps Usd/Jpy capped on advances through 107.00. No adverse reaction to more dovish rhetoric from BoJ Governor Kuroda balanced with the unflinching belief that Japan will not return to deflation and it is not necessary to ease benchmark rates further even though recession will continue in Q2.</p><p>GBP/SEK/NOK - The Pound continues to fall victim to bearish historical patterns and increasingly negative technical impulses as Cable relinquished another round number at 1.2200 to test deeper support ahead of 1.2150 (circa 1.2166) before finding underlying bids, with perhaps some fundamental weakness emanating from BoE Governor Bailey acknowledging that markets are anticipating more QE. Meanwhile, the aforementioned risk aversion has knocked the Swedish Krona out of its stride and back under 10.6000 vs the Euro, but firm crude prices following a less downbeat IEA monthly report in terms of global demand destruction are helping Eur/Nok in a downward trajectory near 11.0000, albeit off Wednesday’s sub-10.9250 two month lows.</p><p>CAD/CHF/EUR - Buoyant oil is also underpinning the Loonie either side of 1.4100 vs its US counterpart in the run up to the BoC’s FSR, while the Franc is back in a bind or divergent position given Usd/Chf holding above 0.9700 in contrast to Eur/Chf edging back down towards 1.0500, as the single currency straddles 1.0800 against the Greenback after light stops were tripped at the big figure, but not larger ones said to be sitting beneath at 1.0775. Note, Eur/Usd is shrouded in a cluster of big option expiries today spanning 1.0750 to 1.0930 – check out the headline feed at 7.23BST for full details and the other major strikes in play.</p><p>EM - Not even the deteriorating mood amidst heightened COVID-19 2nd wave and US-China relations or rising crude costs can dent the Try’s ardour it seems, as the Lira remains above 7.0000 and drawing traction currently from hopes that the CBRT can arrange swap lines with foreign peers..</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Broad risk sentiment remains bearish, but debt futures have pared back after reaching heady heights early in the EU session with <strong>Bunds</strong> back under 174.00 and <strong>Gilts</strong> only just keeping their noses in front of 138.00. Conversely, equity markets have trimmed some declines, though are still looking prone to bouts of selling pressure and long liquidation after significant retracement and storm clouds gathering again over the coronavirus plus US-China relations. Back to bonds, <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have been largely side-lined and holding a flatter bias even though President Trump continues his NIRP campaign, awaiting initial claims and arch Fed dove Kashkari.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures remain on the front foot after a somewhat choppy APAC trading session, with fresh modest impetus across the complex derived from the latest IEA oil market report – which proved more optimistic vs. its OPEC and EIA counterparts. The agency cut their 2020 demand growth forecast by 690k BPD (vs OPEC’s 2.23mln BPD and EIA’s 2.9mln BPD) while stating that the decline in H1 oil demand is not as steep as originally feared – with an improvement in the balance seen amid deep production curbs and reopening economies, however, IEA Chief Birol stated that he does not believe the recently announced cuts (i.e Saudi, UAE, and Kuwaiti over-compliance) are enough to balance the markets. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia has reportedly cut oil sales by half to the US &amp; Europe, deeper cuts than for Asia, as output has been reduced, according to sources. Shipments to some US and European buyers will fall by 60-70% vs. normally contracted volumes. This comes in the context of Aramco raising OSPs across the regions, lower sales to Europe and the US could be a function of the lower demand from lockdowns. Aside from that, news-flow has been light for the complex – <strong>WTI</strong> June resides around session highs north of USD 26/bbl (vs. low 25.18/bbl), whilst <strong>Brent</strong> July similarly sees itself north of USD 30/bbl (vs. low 28.88/bbl). Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains relatively flat north of USD 1700/oz and around the middle of today’s tight USD 1712-1719/oz range awaiting fresh macro stimulus or Dollar action. <strong>Copper</strong> prices meanwhile tracked losses across equities alongside the soured sentiment, and reside in proximity to USD 2.400/lb, having tested support at USD 2.3350/lb earlier in the session.</p>",

Continuing claims, meanwhile, jumped to 22.65mln, above the 19.91mln forecast, while the prior was revised higher -- that 22.65mln is around three times greater than the peak in the great recession. Oxford Economics said that while initial claims continue to slowly recede from their peaks, they remain at painfully high levels - claims at 3.2mln are around 15 times the level of claims before the pandemic, and OxEco sees continuing claims numbers continuing to rise given it lags initial jobless claims. Others have noted that weekly claims are decaying at rate of around 15-18% per week, and if the current trajectory continues, claims will be sub-1mln in the second or third week of June.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/4f29c16f-5bb9-4004-9783-6cad5522a599.jpg\"></figure>",

T-Notes went into the US session with a modest bid, to then see a spike higher upon the Fed Chair Powell speech text release, which saw a pushing-out of the NIRP pricing along the FF term structure. The bias on the day was for a flatter curve amid risk pressure, nonetheless, and the curve resumed its bull-flattening heading into the 30-year auction. The auction tailed the 1.334% WI by 0.8bps, although the internals weren’t bad given the Bond has been heavily bid in the past few session: covered 2.30x (vs avg. 2.40x), dealers took 21.38% (vs avg. 19.8%), indirects 65.69% (vs avg. 63.8%).

        "analysis_details": "<p>Asia stocks traded negative with global risk appetite dampened by ongoing US-China tensions and following comments from Fed Chair Powell who provided a grim picture on the economy and pushed back on negative rates. ASX 200 (-1.2%) was led lower by energy and financials after similar underperformance of the sectors stateside and with participants digesting alarming employment data that showed a near-600k decline in jobs. Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) remained under the influence of a firmer currency and with earnings releases also providing a catalyst for price action including Sony which was pressured after its FY net dropped more than 36% Y/Y. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) were both downbeat as US-China tensions turned up a notch after source reports noted China will soon impose countermeasures on those seeking COVID-19 damages from China and after US President Trump extended the executive order protecting the US supply chain from Huawei and ZTE for an additional year, while the PBoC also disappointed expectations for an MLF announcement and associated 20bps rate cut which both failed to materialize. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as prices benefitted from the risk aversion and gains in T-notes, but with upside later reversed after a mixed 30yr auction which resulted in lower accepted prices.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Asia stocks trade negative as global risk appetite remains dampened amid ongoing US-China tensions and following comments from Fed Chair Powell who provided a grim picture on the economy and pushed back on negative rates. ASX 200 (-0.9%) was led lower by energy and financials after similar underperformance of the sectors stateside and with participants digesting alarming employment data that showed a near-600k decline in jobs. Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) remains under the influence of a firmer currency and with earnings releases also providing a catalyst for price action including Sony which was pressured after its FY net dropped more than 36% Y/Y. Hang Seng (-1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are both downbeat as US-China tensions turn up a notch with source reports noting China will soon impose countermeasures on those seeking COVID-19 damages from China and after US President Trump extended the executive order protecting the US supply chain from Huawei and ZTE for an additional year, while the PBoC also disappointed expectations for an MLF announcement and associated 20bps rate cut which failed to materialize.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains above the 100.00 level and holds on to the gains seen following comments from Fed Chair Powell who warned of a slow recovery and that additional policy measures may be needed to avoid lasting damage to the economy, but also dismissed the prospect of negative rates. The greenback’s major counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD languishing at the prior day’s lows and near the 1.0800 level where there is a EUR 1.2bln option expiry rolling off at today’s New York cut, while GBP/USD briefly tested 1.2200 to the downside due to the recent significant contraction in GDP and after BoE Governor Bailey signalled the bank is likely to increase government bond purchases. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are pressured by the risk-averse tone, while antipodeans are constrained by the downbeat sentiment and after Australian jobs data showed a record contraction in Employment Change and although the Unemployment Rate was not as high as expected at 6.2% vs. Exp. 8.3% (Prev. 5.2%), this coincided with an unprecedented drop in the Participation Rate and warnings from officials of more pain ahead. NZD/USD also marginally extended on its losses after the New Zealand Budget which forecast wider budget deficits and a contraction in GDP of 4.6% vs. Prev. forecast of 2.3% expansion.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as prices benefit from the risk aversion and gains in T-notes, but with upside only marginal as participants look ahead to 30yr auction today.</p>",
