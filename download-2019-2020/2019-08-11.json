The decision comes as China halts US agricultural imports. Trump also stated “we’re not doing business with Huawei” however, the White House later tempered his comments. Tech stocks were also dragged lower following poor earnings results from DXC Tech (DXC), which fell over 30% on Friday as it lowered its FY forecast which led to a slew of price target cuts. Other names lower in the space include Microchip (MCHP), Micron (MU), Nvidia (NVDA) &amp; Xilinx (XLNX). Broadcom (AVGO) traded over 3% higher as it officially announced it will acquire Symantec’s (SYMC) enterprise security assets for USD 10.7bln, while Uber (UBER) were hit after misses on both EPS and revenue, as well as gross bookings. S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 2919, Dow Jones -0.3% at 26287, Nasdaq-100 -1.0% at 7646.</p><p>Treasuries were positive in early trade, on the familiar concerns of slowing global growth, and the reintroduction of political risk in Europe courtesy of Italy, while UK growth contracting in Q2 did little to help. However, in later trade, yields moved higher, leaving the curve slightly steeper, with major curve spreads modestly wider to the tune of 1-2bps at settlement; the afternoon bounce was due to the White House ‘clarifying’ comments President Trump made on Huawei. On the week, the curve has bull flattened (on the week: 2s -9bps, 5s -11bps, 10s -12bps, and 30s -14bps). US T-note futures settled 7+ ticks lower at 129-22.</p>",
