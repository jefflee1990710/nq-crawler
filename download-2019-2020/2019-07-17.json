Risk sentiment was hampered heading into the US session as equity index futures headed south, while the T-Note was also taking cues from EGBs. Some desks attributed the upside in Treasury in pre-market to comments from ECB’s Coeure, who again said that the bank was ready to act if needed, likely providing some tailwinds; shortly afterwards, US June Housing Starts and Building Permits data missed expectations widely, adding to the Treasury bid. Bank of America’s disappointing on its NIM, just as some other major banks have, further cemented the ominous outlook for financials (which has been a drag on the SPX today), in addition to some disappointing earnings from CSX helped accelerate the risk sell-off. A ho-hum Fed Beige Book failed to move the dial, and at settlement the curve had bull flattened, with 2s10s narrowing by just under 3bps, as the 2-year yield fell by around 2bps, whilst the 10-year yields eased by around 5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 14 ticks higher at 127-11+.</p>",

Compensation grew at a modest to modest pace; some contacts reported significant increases in entry level wages. The rate of price inflation was ‘stable to down slightly’. Manufacturing generally flat, though pickups reported in some districts. Some saw delayed business investment. Labour markets remained tight, with contacts across the country experiencing difficulties filling open positions. BMO also note that the loan demand was ‘broad based’ which is consistent with companies taking advantage of the lower financing costs</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's George (voter, hawkish) said downside risks to the economy come from trade uncertainty and slowing global growth; says she is prepared to adjust her view of monetary policy should downside risks materialise.She later said that she was not ready to cut rates later this month, but was flexible. Overnight, Fed’s Daly (non-voter) said she was not leaning one way or the other on rate decision.</p><p><strong>* US HOUSING STARTS/BUILDING PERMITS: </strong>The headlines both missed expectations (starts were 1.253mln vs exp 1.26mln; permits were 1.22mln vs exp 1.3mln). The weak data contributed to risk-off trade. That said, Pantheon Macroeconomics says the details are better than the headline implied: “with both starts and permits depressed by steep drops in the wildly volatile multi-family numbers, down 9.2% and 16.8% respectively, but single family starts rose 3.5%, with permits up a trivial 0.4%.” Pantheon explains that building permits tend to lead starts, and are less susceptible to weather distortions, so they are a better guide to activity. “The trend in single-family permits has been flat, more or less, in recent months, as homebuilders have not responded to the rise in new home sales,” Pantheon says, “we’re assuming that a combination of nervousness in the early part of the year, after the drop in the stock market in Q4, and a desire to reduce inventory, which rose last year, explains the softness of permit demand. But with mortgage applications now appearing to respond to the 1100bp drop in rates since November, we expect home sales to reach new highs in the late summer or early fall, dragging up housing construction in due course.”</p><p><strong>* US DEBT CEILING: </strong>A Politico journalist quoted House Speaker Pelosi, after she had spoken with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, as saying she wants a debt ceiling deal by the end of the week if Congress is going to pass a spending a debt limit package before the August recess.</p><p><strong>* CANADA INFLATION: </strong>Headline inflation saw a small upside surprise (-0.2% M/M vs expected -0.3%); the Y/Y rate slipped to 2.0% from 2.4%. As was expected, it was softer energy prices that drove the softness in June. There were some revisions to the previous data, which saw the average of the BOC measures revised up to 2.1% in May; the June data showed the average of these three measures decelerating to 2.03%; crucially (and combined with the softness in core inflation), the average remained above 2.0% - the midpoint of the BOC’s inflation target band – and analysts said that this would allow the central bank to remain in neutral mode.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>There are some suggestions that the Boris Johnson camp would look to hold early General Elections in the UK before the summer of 2020, to try and exploit a divided opposition (but not before Brexit is delivered). This is not the first time that scenarios for elections has been mentioned in recent days. Indeed, analysts have said that drama could be awaiting any incoming Tory leader. On 23rd July, results from the leadership ballot will be published, and it is likely that a government will at some point face a no confidence motion – whether this is fired before or after the recess on 25th July 2019, the UK could be heading for early elections. Later, the Telegraph reported that Johnson will reportedly appoint hard line Eurosceptic Daniel Moylan as his ‘Brexit Brain’; Moylan supports scrapping of the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, new European Commission Chief von der Leyen has been supportive of an Article 50 extension, though she has ruled out a re-negotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement, which maintains the prospect for conflict between the UK and the EU. Elsewhere, Brexit Secretary Barclay said Brexit no deal risks were under-priced, and dismissed reports from earlier in the week about an uncomfortable conversation with Brexit negotiator Barnier, dismissing the reports as misleading. Finally, The UK Upper House backed an attempt to prevent the next Prime Minister from shutting down Parliament in order to force a no-deal Brexit; the Lords voted 272 to 169 in favour of an amendment to the Northern Ireland Bill which its supporters claim will prevent Parliament being prorogued in the run-up to 31 October. Analysts say this sets up a major Commons showdown when the legislation is debated again by MPs on Thursday. Furthermore on the no deal Brexit front, Johnson declined to comment on when he will bring the Queen’s speech into parliament, but he does state he will not dissent from the view that November is a good time for it. This could suggest Johnson could prorogue parliament from mid-October (there is usually a two-week prorogation ahead of the Queen's speech), meaning lawmakers would not be sitting over the UK exit date on 31st October, thus, possibly allowing Johnson to engineer a no deal Brexit without the backing of parliament.</p><p><strong>* UK INFLATION: </strong>Was steady at 2.0% Y/Y in June, core inflation rose one-tenth to 1.8% Y/Y, as expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that, looking ahead, CPI will fall a bit below the 2.0% target in H2 2019, as energy’s contribution continues to decline. But it says that core goods inflation has further to rise, given that consumer goods import prices were up 2.3% Y/Y in the three months to May. “What’s more, the recent pick-up in wage growth likely will loop back to CPI services inflation before long, given that it hasn’t been countered by productivity gains.,” I says, adding that “core inflation, then, looks set to rise over the next 12 months, pushing the headline rate back up to the 2% target in 2020 and ensuring that the MPC only will cut interest rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>China announced that it had appointed Zhong Shan to the team who are negotiating trade with the US. An SCMP analysis suggests he is seen very hawkish, which traders have taken as an indication that China is in no hurry to wrap up trade discussions with the US, and may wait for the outcome of the 2020 elections. In later trade, a NY Times reporter suggested that US Secretary of State Pompeo criticised Chinese treatment of Uighurs, adding that the US may be considering a more proactive response, as it has been been holding off on sanctions against Chinese leaders amid trade talks.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>President Trump is reportedly said to allow Senator Paul to open the backchannel with Iran representatives, according to Politico. Trump has been attempting to start negotiations with Iran for months. The news follows comments from Secretary of State Pompeo on Tuesday, where he appeared to suggest Tehran was willing to discuss its ballistic missile programme (although this was denied by a spokesperson later on Tuesday). Later, Iran’s Foreign Minister said the nation could close the Straits of Hormuz, but does not want to.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Coeure (Neutral) said looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by the ECB's policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion, and stronger wage growth. He reiterated that Governing Council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. Coeure also said that incoming economic data and survey information point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year.</p><p><strong>* SARB PREVIEW: </strong>The consensus view, as well as implied money market pricing, looks for the South African Reserve Bank to cut rates by 25bps at its July policy meeting. Analysts note that growth and inflation have given the SARB to loosen the strings, while a more dovish external environment also adds to the case for rate cuts. Analysts will also watch the vote split, given the decision to remain unchanged at its previous meeting was not unanimous, after two of the five policymakers called for a rate cut. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22316/download\">Click here for preview.</a></p><p><strong>* BOK PREVIEW: </strong>The consensus view, as well as implied money market pricing, looks for the South African Reserve Bank to cut rates by 25bps at its July policy meeting.

Risk sentiment was hampered heading into the US session as equity index futures headed south, while the T-Note was also taking cues from EGBs. Some desks attributed the upside in Treasury in pre-market to comments from ECB’s Coeure, who again said that the bank was ready to act if needed, likely providing some tailwinds; shortly afterwards, US June Housing Starts and Building Permits data missed expectations widely, adding to the Treasury bid. Bank of America’s disappointing on its NIM, just as some other major banks have, further cemented the ominous outlook for financials (which has been a drag on the SPX today), in addition to some disappointing earnings from CSX helped accelerate the risk sell-off. A ho-hum Fed Beige Book failed to move the dial,&nbsp; and at settlement the curve had bull flattened, with 2s10s narrowing by just under 3bps, as the 2-year yield fell by around 2bps, whilst the 10-year yields eased by around 5bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.84 LOWER AT USD 56.78: </strong>Oil prices settled lower again after a second leg of selling was initiated from a (net) bearish US inventory report (while crude drew more than expected, crude+products was a build) alongside some more constructive developments for US-Iran relations. Prior to the EIA release prices had been making some modest gains, paring back some of the losses from the sell-off on Tuesday due to the Trump administration announcing it was willing to talk with Iran about its missile programme, however, the market soon reversed as the report was digested, and traders took note of the denial from an Iranian official. DOE data showed crude stocks drew by 3.1mln bbls, a greater than expected draw as well as deeper than the API report, but the products were markedly bearish, with distillates building 5.7mln bbls (echoing the API and well exceeding expectations) and gasoline – surprise -building 3.6mln bbls. Production did take a considerate dip to 12mln BPD (prev. 12.3mln BPD), although some of this may have been due to the initiation of shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico due to storm Barry. Later in the session Politico reported that Trump had tapped Senator Rand Paul, a vocal opponent to interventionalist US foreign policy, to open a backchannel with Iran, which - if anything - would have kept bullish bets at bay, as was evident in the tape action; although the Politico article notes the long history of failed Iran diplomacy attempts by the USA and begs the question, what new could Senator Paul achieve. Additionally, Tehran had since countered the US’ claims and said the two states were not ready for talks, although the market didn’t seem to care about that with the geopolitical risk premium remaining unwound.</p><p>* <strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.7% AT 2984, NASDAQ-100 -0.5% AT 7889, DOW JONES -0.4% AT 27220.

CSX Corp (CSX) sunk after the co. missed on both top and bottom lines and revised lower FY revenue guidance. Abbot Laboratories (ABT) popped higher after the co. exceeded profit expectations and raised FY19 EPS guidance. Bank of America (BAC) shares advanced after the co. beat profit and FICC expectations, whilst revenue was inline. Comerica Inc (CMA) shares fell after the co. profits that missed expectations. Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC) was under pressure, despite beating on the top line and revenue coming in inline. PNC Financial Services (PNC) moved higher after EPS beat expectations, shrugging off a revenue miss and lower NIM. Progressive Corp. (PGR) sunk after the co. missed revenue expectations. Textron Inc. (TXT) shares shot lower after the co. missed on the bottom line. The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) shares were supported after the co. reported impressive EPS and raised its dividend.

Merck &amp; Co (MRK) was supported after its Recabrio drug was approved by the FDA. Visa (V) shares opened higher on the news that the co. is to invest in Indonesia's Go-Jek as part of the ride-hailing company's ongoing Series F fundraising round. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares struggled again, as the co. faced more criticism for its alleged work with the Chinese military/government. Facebook (FB) shares lagged while the co.’s Libra crypto project took another battering from the US Senate. Tesla (TSLA) jumped higher premarket after Morgan Stanley spoke positively about the electric automakers ability to increase production in China. Home builders were mixed, despite positive comments from RBC names within the sector. Sprint (S) shares moved lower after the co. informed customers of a hacking breach involving a Samsung website. Uber (UBER) fell after an Australian watchdog said Uber's food delivery service Uber Eats will amend its contract terms to accept more accountability for delivery issues, shrugging off news that the co. had announced plans to roll out its ride-hailing service in Hamburg, Germany. eBay (EBAY) reversed early gains after CNBC reported the co. may be moving forward with the sale of StubHub for some USD 10bln. Notable stocks benefiting from positive broker moves include ConocoPhillips (COP) upgraded at BAML, Hershey (HSY) upgraded at Goldman Sachs, Canopy Growth Corp (CGC) rated New Buy at Ladenburg Thalmann.

A risk-off feel to markets on Wednesday kept havens <strong>JPY, CHF</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> higher on the day. <strong>GBP</strong> firmed after hitting YTD lows on Tuesday, taking some influence from the weaker dollar on Wednesday; desks have been highlighting downside risks for the GBP as a no deal Brexit comes back into focus, and as such, many maintain the view that the pound remains a sell on rallies. <strong>CAD</strong> firmed in wake of CPI data which gives the BOC with grounds to remain neutral, adding to the CAD’s appeal over the USD, where the Fed is expected to cut rates; the Loonie was little changed after Fitch affirmed the nation at AAA/stable. The Antipodes were also firmer, with traders eyeing the <strong>AUD</strong> jobs data due overnight. <strong>EMFX</strong> is mixed: <strong>MXN</strong> is stronger, despite the PEMEX 2019 business plan falling short of investor expectations; some desks reason that it is expectations of a deterioration in market conditions will likely see Banxico respond with keeping the currency anchored with high yields, which could limit the upside for USDMXN. <strong>ZAR</strong> is weaker ahead of Thursday’s SARB meeting, where the central bank is expected to cut rates.</p><p><strong>* IMF FX REPORT: </strong>IMF report said that the USD real effective exchange rate (REER) is estimated to be 6-12% overvalued; USD REER appreciated 4% in 2018, 3.4% in 2019 until May (7% depreciation in 2017). The report suggested that China's Yuan REER level was warranted by economic fundamentals and policies. Meanwhile, the report found that EUR REER for Germany (largest Eurozone economy) was estimated to be 8% to 18% undervalued, though was between 1% and 4% overvalued for France (second largest Eurozone economy); the report was critical of the German surplus, which has increased imbalances in the Eurozone.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>The buck has been boosted post the June FOMC, and ahead of the July meeting on the 31st; nonfarm payrolls, core CPI and on Tuesday retail sales have all surprised to the upside, leading to optimism of a firmer pace of growth in Q2/Q3, and by extension, some desks are raising the possibility of less Fed easing than is currently being priced (money markets currently imply easing of around 60bps – or two rate cuts with some change – by the end of the year. The implication for the dollar, technicians say, is that a breach of 97.50 presents challenges for the lower USD thesis being pushed after the Fed pivoted dovish.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling has this week shrugged-off reports that the EU was mulling offering the UK further concessions, as well as suggestions from the new European Commission boss that she is open to the notion of extending Article 50; GBP has also shrugged-off data which showed a strong acceleration in wage growth. The focus is back on the potential for a messy Brexit outcome as the expected victor of the Tory leadership race, Boris Johnson, reportedly strategizes about engineering a no deal Brexit – and that has seen fresh YTD lows for the pound (The Irish Times summarises it nicely: \"the hardening of Boris Johnson’s language on the backstop, ruling out a time limit or a unilateral exit clause, marks a dramatic turn that makes a no-deal Brexit more likely\"). It, therefore, fears of no deal Brexit which is pricing its way back into sterling, and this keeps the prospect of cable sub-1.24 on the cards (and if stabilisation cannot be found, some are warning of GBP 1.20), and why desks are still maintaining their view that GBP remains a sell on rallies. For EURGBP, the most obvious upside target is 0.91, however, this could be complicated by the ECB’s meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to deliver a dovish outcome; in terms of scenarios, SocGen thinks a 'soft' Brexit would take EURGBP to a level around 0.82-0.88, while a 'no-deal' exit would see a move to 0.91-0.97.</p><p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>The complex is reeling after US President Trump on Tuesday floated the threat that he could still slap more tariffs onto China, in a reminder that global trade wars were merely put on hold after the G20, and are clearly no where near closer to resolution. ING says the high degree of unpredictability of US trade policy should keep a lid on EM FX gains, and in its view, this makes EM local currency bonds a more attractive asset class. It explains that the scenarios of (a) more easing from major central banks, and (b) possible escalation of trade wars should be positive for EM fixed income, while in the case of EMFX, the asset class would only do well under the former.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The <strong>USD</strong> took a breather after recent gains, and <strong>DXY</strong> has been unable to breach the 97.50 level, which technicians argue would be bullish enough to challenge the lower USD thesis. A risk-off feel to markets on Wednesday kept havens <strong>JPY, CHF</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> higher on the day. <strong>GBP</strong> firmed after hitting YTD lows, taking some influence from the weaker dollar on Wednesday; desks have been highlighting downside risks for the GBP as a no deal Brexit comes back into focus, and as such, many maintain the view that the pound remains a sell on rallies. <strong>CAD</strong> firmed in wake of CPI data which gives the BOC with grounds to remain neutral, adding to the CAD’s appeal over the USD, where the Fed is expected to cut rates; the Loonie was little changed after Fitch affirmed the nation at AAA/stable. The Antipodes were also firmer, with traders eyeing the <strong>AUD</strong> jobs data due overnight. <strong>EMFX</strong> is mixed: <strong>MXN</strong> is stronger, despite the PEMEX 2019 business plan falling short of investor expectations; some desks reason that it is expectations of a deterioration in market conditions will likely see Banxico respond with keeping the currency anchored with high yields, which could limit the upside for USDMXN. <strong>ZAR</strong> is weaker ahead of Thursday’s SARB meeting, where the central bank is expected to cut rates.</p><p><strong>* IMF FX REPORT: </strong>IMF report said that the USD real effective exchange rate (REER) is estimated to be 6-12% overvalued; USD REER appreciated 4% in 2018, 3.4% in 2019 until May (7% depreciation in 2017). The report suggested that China's Yuan REER level was warranted by economic fundamentals and policies. Meanwhile, the report found that EUR REER for Germany (largest Eurozone economy) was estimated to be 8% to 18% undervalued, though was between 1% and 4% overvalued for France (second largest Eurozone economy); the report was critical of the German surplus, which has increased imbalances in the Eurozone.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>The buck has been boosted post the June FOMC, and ahead of the July meeting on the 31st; nonfarm payrolls, core CPI and on Tuesday retail sales have all surprised to the upside, leading to optimism of a firmer pace of growth in Q2/Q3, and by extension, some desks are raising the possibility of less Fed easing than is currently being priced (money markets currently imply easing of around 60bps – or two rate cuts with some change – by the end of the year. The implication for the dollar, technicians say, is that a breach of 97.50 presents challenges for the lower USD thesis being pushed after the Fed pivoted dovish.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling has this week shrugged-off reports that the EU was mulling offering the UK further concessions, as well as suggestions from the new European Commission boss that she is open to the notion of extending Article 50; GBP has also shrugged-off data which showed a strong acceleration in wage growth. The focus is back on the potential for a messy Brexit outcome as the expected victor of the Tory leadership race, Boris Johnson, reportedly strategizes about engineering a no deal Brexit – and that has seen fresh YTD lows for the pound (The Irish Times summarises it nicely: \"the hardening of Boris Johnson’s language on the backstop, ruling out a time limit or a unilateral exit clause, marks a dramatic turn that makes a no-deal Brexit more likely\"). It, therefore, fears of no deal Brexit which is pricing its way back into sterling, and this keeps the prospect of cable sub-1.24 on the cards (and if stabilisation cannot be found, some are warning of GBP 1.20), and why desks are still maintaining their view that GBP remains a sell on rallies. For EURGBP, the most obvious upside target is 0.91, however, this could be complicated by the ECB’s meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to deliver a dovish outcome; in terms of scenarios, SocGen thinks a 'soft' Brexit would take EURGBP to a level around 0.82-0.88, while a 'no-deal' exit would see a move to 0.91-0.97.</p><p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>The complex is reeling after US President Trump on Tuesday floated the threat that he could still slap more tariffs onto China, in a reminder that global trade wars were merely put on hold after the G20, and are clearly no where near closer to resolution. ING says the high degree of unpredictability of US trade policy should keep a lid on EM FX gains, and in its view, this makes EM local currency bonds a more attractive asset class. It explains that the scenarios of (a) more easing from major central banks, and (b) possible escalation of trade wars should be positive for EM fixed income, while in the case of EMFX, the asset class would only do well under the former.</p>",

Bank of America’s disappointing on its NIM, just as some other major banks have, further cemented the ominous outlook for financials (which has been a drag on the SPX today), in addition to some disappointing earnings from CSX helped accelerate the risk sell-off. A ho-hum Fed Beige Book failed to move the dial,&nbsp; and at settlement the curve had bull flattened, with 2s10s narrowing by just under 3bps, as the 2-year yield fell by around 2bps, whilst the 10-year yields eased by around 5bps.</p>",

Prior to the EIA release prices had been making some modest gains, paring back some of the losses from the sell-off on Tuesday due to the Trump administration announcing it was willing to talk with Iran about its missile programme, however, the market soon reversed as the report was digested, and traders took note of the denial from an Iranian official. DOE data showed crude stocks drew by 3.1mln bbls, a greater than expected draw as well as deeper than the API report, but the products were markedly bearish, with distillates building 5.7mln bbls (echoing the API and well exceeding expectations) and gasoline – surprise -building 3.6mln bbls. Production did take a considerate dip to 12mln BPD (prev. 12.3mln BPD), although some of this may have been due to the initiation of shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico due to storm Barry. Later in the session Politico reported that Trump had tapped Senator Rand Paul, a vocal opponent to interventionalist US foreign policy, to open a backchannel with Iran, which - if anything - would have kept bullish bets at bay, as was evident in the tape action; although the Politico article notes the long history of failed Iran diplomacy attempts by the USA and begs the question, what new could Senator Paul achieve. Additionally, Tehran had since countered the US’ claims and said the two states were not ready for talks, although the market didn’t seem to care about that with the geopolitical risk premium remaining unwound.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Bank of Korea<strong> </strong>is expected to leave its base rate unchanged at 1.75%<strong>,</strong> however, the consensus among banks is split between a hold and a cut, with 21 analysts surveyed by Reuters looking for rates to remain unchanged, and 15 expecting a cut. HSBC highlights the decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as Dr Cho Dongchul voted for a cut back in May, while the recent meeting minutes stated another member was in favour of easing soon. However, Governor Lee mentioned that Dongchul’s view does not represent that of the board. Citi is among those calling for a rate cut, and thinks that the low inflationary pressures, which remain under 1.0% Y/Y, combined with weak economic growth momentum due to declining exports amid trade wars, as well as sluggish domestic production necessitates an earlier move than markets have pencilled in (the Street view is for a rate cut in August). The debate on whether the BOK will cut this week, or at its next policy meeting, is likely contingent on how the policymakers want to move ahead of the Fed’s anticipated cut at the July meeting – the BOK’s last rate move (a hike) was specifically designed to mitigate risks of capital outflows. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/22317/download\"><strong>here.</strong></a></p><p>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>In marked contrast to Tuesday, US data has not given the Dollar a fillip with housing starts and building permits both falling some way short of expectations and keeping the <strong>DXY</strong> suppressed within a 96.266-448 range. To recap, yesterday’s retail sales report was significantly above consensus and especially the key control group component and then index extended post-release gains but did not manage to test near term technical resistance at 97.588 and will now be eyeing the Fed’s Beige Book for further inspiration/direction.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Contrasting performances even though the Buck stopped advancing, with the Aussie underperforming and pulling back further from recent highs towards significant/psychological levels at 0.7000 and 1.0400 vs the Kiwi. A 500 mn+ Aud/Usd expiry at the 0.7000 strike may have exerted a gravitational pull, but the fact that the Aud/Nzd cross also retreated suggests that other bearish factors impacted, like renewed strains between US-China on the trade front and caution in advance of overnight jobs data. Note, latest RBA minutes have arguably heightened the focus on the labour markets after back-to-back rate cuts and a shift to wait-and-see mode. Conversely, Nzd/Usd held ‘comfortably’ above 0.6700 and is back on track from a technical angle if it closes higher than the 200 DMA (circa 0.6714), while Usd/Cad pared light losses in wake of Canadian data showing some soft inflation elements and sub-forecast manufacturing sales with the Loonie returning towards the middle of a 1.3093-52 range.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The aforementioned Greenback downturn helped the Pound stage a particularly impressive comeback from sub-1.2400 lows, although Eur/Gbp also recoiled from around 0.9050 to 0.9025 even though the single currency staved off heavy pressure to breach 1.1200 at one stage and Eur/Usd subsequently regained a degree of composure as well. However, there were no obvious Sterling specific catalysts besides Brexit Secretary Barclay attempting to play down misleading reports about his meeting with EU’s Barnier that were described as more fractious than previous convenes.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Marginal moves or deviations from relatively narrow confines vs the Usd as the Yen meandered between decent options at 108.00 (1.5 bn) and 108.30 (1.1 bn) and the Franc pared some losses from 0.9907 to 0.9872, while also recovering lost ground against the Euro through 1.1100.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Divergence between the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Sek tested 10.5100 from a high of 10.5360+, but Eur/Nok bounced from just above 9.6100 to 9.6330+ as oil prices waned on the back of EIA weekly inventories showing a bigger than forecast crude stock draw, but rises in products and production.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Zar slipped back from 14.0000 peaks after stronger than anticipated SA retail sales data, but the Rand remained well below recent highs ahead of tomorrow’s SARB policy verdict with a ¼ point ease expected.</p>",

This weighed on the regional indices from the open although the <strong>ASX 200 (+0.5%)</strong> quickly bucked the trend with upside in defensive sectors and miners leading the turnaround including BHP which gained after it topped production estimates despite output declining Y/Y, although the energy sector underperformed after crude prices slipped around 3%. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) </strong>and<strong> KOSPI (-0.9%)</strong> weakened as the soured Japan-South Korea relations and ongoing trade dispute continued to take its toll, while <strong>Hang Seng (-0.1%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%)</strong> conformed to the glum after US President Trump suggested there is a long way to go regarding trade with China and that the US can put tariffs on another USD 325bln of goods if it wants. Furthermore, China made a hawkish addition to its trade team indicating that it is in no hurry to wrap up trade discussions, although pressure in the mainland was limited after the PBoC conducted a consecutive substantial liquidity injection.

Note, however, Eur/Usd appears capped ahead of decent option expiries between 1.1250-55 (1.1 bn), just like Usd/Jpy within 108.12-32 given similar size expiry interest running off at 108.00 (1.5 bn) and 108.30 (1.1 bn) at the NY cut. Elsewhere, Aud/Usd has drifted back towards 0.7000 after topping out a few pips short of 0.7050 on Tuesday amidst less positive vibes on US-China trade prospects following President Trump’s latest tweets and tariff threats plus the appointment of a so called hawk to Beijing’s negotiating team.

The 10 year Eurozone bond retains a decent bid, albeit lagging behind its UK equivalent after a tepid 2048 German auction and inflation data too close to consensus of preliminary prints to warrant more than a cursory glance. For the record, intraday highs at 172.80 and 131.08 respectively have been posted and technical resistance has capped further gains ahead of the US open. However, in contrast to Tuesday US Treasuries are also holding a firm and flatter line following underperformance at the same stage, and with Wednesday’s data unlikely to prompt the same kind of price action as retail sales, although the Beige Book will be interesting ahead of the looming FOMC.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Nzd/Usd has rebounded relatively firmly back above 0.6700 and is retesting the 200 DMA circa 0.6718 mainly due to the Greenback losing a bit of its retail sales momentum and the <strong>DXY </strong>fading just shy of 97.500, though the Kiwi may have gleaned some belated traction from yesterday’s rebound in GDT auction prices after the in line and firmer NZ CPI data for Q2 overnight. Similarly, Usd/Cad has retreated towards 1.3050 from close to 1.3100 as the Loonie eyes Canadian inflation data for independent impetus and draws some underlying support from firm crude prices in the run up.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, or at least unexpectedly, Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are both firmer and nudging big figures at 0.9900 and 1.1100 respectively without any apparent rationale for Franc underperformance. However, following recent strength it would not be out of the realms of reality to point the finger at official intervention/rate checking or front-running the SNB.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the single currency clings on to the 1.1200 handle after a more concerted attempt to fill evidently substantial bids at the round number, albeit in no small part due to contagion from another bout of Sterling weakness as Cable tumbled further below 1.2400 and Eur/Gbp touched 0.9050. Note, however, Eur/Usd appears capped ahead of decent option expiries between 1.1250-55 (1.1 bn), just like Usd/Jpy within 108.12-32 given similar size expiry interest running off at 108.00 (1.5 bn) and 108.30 (1.1 bn) at the NY cut. Elsewhere, Aud/Usd has drifted back towards 0.7000 after topping out a few pips short of 0.7050 on Tuesday amidst less positive vibes on US-China trade prospects following President Trump’s latest tweets and tariff threats plus the appointment of a so called hawk to Beijing’s negotiating team. Back to the beleaguered Pound, no real reaction to largely in line UK inflation data, with the exception of PPI input prices that were considerably weaker than forecast.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand is a notable regional laggard, with Usd/Zar hovering near the top of a 14.0000-13.9500 range ahead of SA retail sales data at midday and the SARB meeting on Thursday when a rate cut is widely anticipated (-25 bp), while ongoing doubts about Eskom are also weighing on sentiment.</p>",

As such, the greenback’s major counterparts only managed to nurse partial losses with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> dispirited after having slipped to test 1.1200 and 1.2400 respectively, with the latter also at its weakest since early-2017 amid increasing concerns of a no-deal Brexit. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> is rangebound with price action contained in between large option expiries for today’s New York cut at 108.00 (USD 1.5bln) and 108.30 (USD 1.3bln), while antipodeans were also hampered due to their high-beta characteristics and amid declines in the commodities complex.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mostly lacklustre overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures was stuck at the prior day’s lows below USD 58.00/bbl after prices slipped around 3% during US trade on comments from the US which suggested a wind-down of US-Iran tensions and that Iran is prepared to negotiate regarding its missile program. This was later refuted by the Iranian side, although the energy complex still failed to recoup the losses as efforts to normalize output in the Gulf of Mexico and a narrower than expected draw in headline API crude stockpiles kept prices restrained. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were also kept in check and briefly eyed USD 1400/oz to the downside as the greenback held near the prior day’s best levels, while attempts to nurse losses in <strong>copper</strong> were suppressed by the downbeat risk sentiment and as Chinese <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices pulled back from record levels.</p><p><strong>API Weekly Energy Inventories (15 July): -1.4mln (exp. -2.7mln, prev. -8.129mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>US Gulf of Mexico Crude oil production cut by 58% (Prev. 69%) due to Tropical Storm Barry.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The curve bear flattened; yields higher across the curve (2s +3.1bps, 5s +3.5bps, 10s +3.4bps, 30s +3bps) despite dovish rhetoric from Fed officials and geopolitical tensions bubbling away. The complex took its cue from June's retail sales data, which beat expectations. However, the data will likely only have a limited impact on the Fed's policy, where it is expected to cut rates by at least 25bps at its July policy meeting. Pricing for a 50bps rate cut fell slightly in wake of the data, however. And the Fed commentary did little to add to '50bps cut' pricing. The markets have priced 31bps of cuts for the July meeting (implying a 25bps rate cut, with a 24% chance of a 50bps rate cut), and around 66bps of easing is priced through the end of the year (at the end of last week, it was about 70bps). At settlement, major curve spreads were slightly narrower.

Powell added that the manufacturing sector has been weak since start of 2019 and despite low unemployment and solid growth, inflation pressures remain muted. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Evans (Voter, Dove)</strong> said a little more accommodation may be needed to get inflation back to target and that even if a US-China trade deal is reached, he would still call for cuts unless he saw signs that it would bring up inflation. Furthermore, Evans believes 50bps of easing is required to lift inflation and said it is a question of strategy regarding a either a 25bps or 50bps rate cut in July as a larger cut might achieve inflation goals more quickly. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Daly (Non, Voter, Dove)</strong> said she is not leaning one way or the other regarding July interest rate decision and that it is too early to tell if additional stimulus is required to reach above trend growth. Daly also commented that real side data has been a little stronger than expected and that there are no clouds looming on consumer spending or healthy labour market. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said a rate cut could be warranted based on bond market signals although cuts could be limited or restrained, while Kaplan added it is possible there is more slack in the labour market and that he sees inflation being muted this year.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower as the region follows suit to the lacklustre performance on Wall St where all major indices pulled back from record levels as participants digested the first bout of blue-chip earnings and with risk sentiment also pressured after comments from US President Trump added to the doubts for a near-term breakthrough with China. This weighed on the regional indices from the open although the ASX 200 (+0.5%) has since bucked the trend with upside in defensive sectors and miners leading the turnaround including BHP which gained after it topped production estimates despite output declining Y/Y, although the energy sector underperforms after crude prices slipped around 3%. Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) and KOSPI (-1.0%) are weaker as the soured Japan-South Korea bilateral relations and ongoing trade dispute continues to take its toll, while Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) conform to the glum after US President Trump suggested there is a long way to go regarding trade with China and that the US can put tariffs on another USD 325bln of goods if it wants. China’s Foreign Ministry also refuted suggestions that China needs a trade deal with the US due to the economy slowing and reports suggested China’s new addition to the trade team Zhong Shan is seen as very hawkish which indicates China is in no hurry to wrap up trade discussions, although pressure in the mainland is limited after the PBoC conducted a consecutive substantial liquidity injection.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly eased off the prior day’s highs but still holds on to most of the recent gains after having reclaimed the 97.00 level and with the advances also fuelled by better than expected Retail Sales. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts have only managed to nurse partial losses with EUR/USD and GBP/USD dispirited after having slipped to test the 1.1200 and 1.2400 handles respectively, with the latter also at its weakest since early-2017 amid increasing concerns of a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is rangebound with price action contained in between large option expiries for today’s New York cut at 108.00 (USD 1.5bln) and 108.30 (USD 1.3bln), while antipodeans are also hampered due to the sturdy USD as well as their high-beta characteristics.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued as prices fail to benefit from the upside in T-notes and weakness in stocks, with participants sidelined ahead of a 20yr JGB auction.</p>",
