(Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEC Director Kudlow said US President Trump is moderately optimistic on China deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK lawmakers accepted Brady&#39;s amendment (N) by 317 to 301 votes which requires the backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangement, while lawmakers also accepted Spelman&#39;s amendment (I) by 318 to 310 votes which expresses MP objection to a no-deal Brexit by stating that the House of Commons &quot;rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship&quot;. However, Parliament rejected the other 5 amendments which were voted on including those which involve delaying the Brexit date. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said the majority of members have said they will support a deal with changes to the backstop and that she will seek legally binding changes to the WA. However, French President&rsquo;s office said that the divorce deal and backstop is not up for renegotiation and that France will push ahead with preparations for a no-deal scenario, while the Irish government also reiterated that the WA is not open for renegotiation and EU Commission Head Juncker earlier reiterated to UK PM May that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened and stated the Brady amendment will not work. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITV&rsquo;s political editor tweeted that the Cabinet ministers threatening to resign if no-deal not taken off table have been reassured by pledge from PM May that MPs will be able to vote on a motion that rules no-deal out by 14 Feb at latest. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austrian Cabinet will name Robert Holzmann as future Governor of Austrian National Bank on Wednesday who will succeed ECB&#39;s Nowotny when his term expires at the end of August, according to government sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Deputy PM Salvini is reportedly feeling the pressure to call for an early election.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said US is always looking at additional sanctions on Venezuela, while there were separate reports that US is to allow Venezuelan opposition to gain access to accounts held by the Federal Reserve. Furthermore, a US Official said they will carry on using its diplomatic and economic tools to support interim Venezuela President Guaido and National Security Advisor Bolton said that there will be serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaido, while Venezuela&rsquo;s ambassador accused the Trump administration of preparing a military invasion of Venezuela. (Newswires).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia is planning on further oil production cuts and exports next month, believes US can solve its Venezuela oil shortage problem with SPR releases. (WSJ)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moody&#39;s said the US government shutdown was credit negative to the extent that it disrupted the economy.

In healthcare, Pfizer (PFE) opened higher after beating top and bottom line, although it did lower guidance. HCA Healthcare (HCA) traded in the green following strong EPS and revenue figures in addition to raising guidance. Allergan (AGN) underperformed after it lowered its guidance below expectations. GameStop (GME) nosedived following its decision to no longer sell itself. NVIDIA (NVDA) traded lower on the open with thanks to a downgrade at Morgan Stanley. Dell Technologies (DELL) benefitted from a Buy initiation at Raymond James. Looking ahead, we expect earnings from Apple (AAPL), Amgen (AMGN), AMD (AMD) and eBay (EBAY) after the close. SPX -0.15% at 2640, NASDAQ -0.96% at 6633, DJI +0.21% at 24580.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries pushed higher following the auction and an overhang of risk factors such as the evolving Brexit scenario, caution ahead of key China trade talks and worries about the shutdown&rsquo;s impact. The majority of today&rsquo;s action was seen in the belly of the curve where the 5-year yield fell by 3.1bps, 7-year fell 3.5bps and 10-year fell 3.2bps; the 2-year and 30-year both fell by a more muted c. 2bps. The 5s30s and 10s30s spreads widened by c. 1bps, whereas we saw flattening at the front to belly of the curve. The US Treasury sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes today in what could be considered an average auction, tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.625%, the lowest since January 2018. Indirect bidders took below the six-week auction average, however, so did dealer bidders and direct bidders took 24.9%, well above the 15.2% average. US T-note futures (H9) settled 9 ticks higher at 121-25.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin refused to answer a question on whether the President would shut down the government again, but Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he wants to avoid Trump declaring a national emergency to build the border wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Early comments saw NEC Director Kudlow stating that US President Trump is moderately optimistic on a deal with China. Nikkei reported that China is expected to present a roadmap on structural reforms to the U.S. in Wednesday&#39;s and Thursday&#39;s meetings in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK lawmakers rejected most of the amendments on PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal, however, it did accept the Spelman amendment, which rejects a no deal Brexit. While the amendment is not legally binding, it is hard for UK PM May to ignore a parliamentary majority, analysts said. The key Brady amendment was also accepted, which May said would give her a mandate to re-open negotiations with the EU, and demand an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop in an attempt to secure a legally binding change in the withdrawal agreement that UK lawmakers can accept. However, through the course of the day, EU policymakers have leaned-back on the notion of re-opening negotiations; Messrs Macron and Juncker have already suggested that the amendment was not amendable, and an EU spokesperson reiterated this immediately after the Brady amendment was voted on, so it remains to be seen what PM May can do. May&rsquo;s challenge was seen in the GBP response, which fell to new LOD on the accepting of Brady&rsquo;s amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.32 HIGHER AT USD 53.31/BBL, BRENT (H9) SETTLE USD 1.39 HIGHER AT USD 61.32/BBL.</strong> A moody Monday in the crude complex has been reversed, with the oil market all in the green as the market has turned its focus to sanction action from the US on Venezuela after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin mentioned more injunctions on the controversy-laden country are still possible. The looming spectre of shortened supply, alongside a slightly softer buck, has squeezed Brent and WTI futures beyond the USD 60/bbl and USD 52/bbl levels respectively. Analysts at Citi are also citing background support for oil prices from &ldquo;the OPEC+ production cuts and, in particular Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s announced intention to reduce output to 10.1mln bpd for February, a step below the 10.31mln bpd official target and roughly 1.0mln bpd below their November peak&rdquo;. This over 2% rise in futures has come ahead of the upcoming API figures, wherein forecasters expect a stockpile growth (of 3.2mln barrels) for the 9th straight week, with gasoline inventories also seen increasing (by 1.9mln barrels) and distillate stocks declining (by 1.4mln barrels).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.15% at 2640, NASDAQ -0.96% at 6633, DJI +0.21% at 24580. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.32%, Materials +1.00%, Industrials +1.37%, Cons Discretionary -0.82%, Cons Staples +0.17%, Healthcare +0.47%, Financials -0.30%, Tech -1.01%, Telecoms -1.06%, Utilities +0.29%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Several industrials reported strong earnings yesterday evening and this morning with 3M (MMM), Corning (GLW), Dover (DOV), Paccar (PCAR), Harris (HRS) and L3 Technologies (LLL) all opening higher after beating top and bottom line estimates; Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Harley Davidson (HOG) opened lower after disappointing on revenue expectations. In healthcare, Pfizer (PFE) opened higher after beating top and bottom line, although it did lower guidance. HCA Healthcare (HCA) traded in the green following strong EPS and revenue figures in addition to raising guidance. Allergan (AGN) underperformed after it lowered its guidance below expectations. GameStop (GME) nosedived following its decision to no longer sell itself. NVIDIA (NVDA) traded lower on the open with thanks to a downgrade at Morgan Stanley. Dell Technologies (DELL) benefitted from a Buy initiation at Raymond James. Looking ahead, we expect earnings from Apple (AAPL), Amgen (AMGN), AMD (AMD) and eBay (EBAY) after the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX </strong>fell in January to a 16-month low of 120.2 from December&rsquo;s 128.1 reading, below the expected 124.7. Analysts at Pantheon note how since 2016&rsquo;s election the index has been elevated above actual consumer spending growth and now that gap has narrowed. Elsewhere in the survey inflation expectations fell by 0.1% to a 13-year low of 4.4% and the differential between jobs hard to get and jobs plentiful fell from 34.6 to 34.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 121-25. </strong>Treasuries pushed higher following the auction and an overhang of risk factors such as the evolving Brexit scenario, caution ahead of key China trade talks and worries about the shutdown&rsquo;s impact. The majority of today&rsquo;s action was seen in the belly of the curve where the 5-year yield fell by 3.1bps, 7-year fell 3.5bps and 10-year fell 3.2bps; the 2-year and 30-year both fell by a more muted c. 2bps. The 5s30s and 10s30s spreads widened by c. 1bps, whereas we saw flattening at the front to belly of the curve. The US Treasury sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes today in what could be considered an average auction, tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.625%, the lowest since January 2018. Indirect bidders took below the six-week auction average, however, so did dealer bidders and direct bidders took 24.9%, well above the 15.2% average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling off best levels and taking a hit on the Plan B Brexit vote with Cable falling below 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp consolidating at the top of a 0.8750-0.8655. UK lawmakers rejected the key Cooper&rsquo;s amendment B, which would have given the government time for a bid to delay the Brexit date (29th March); amendments A, O, G, J have also been rejected by Parliament. Cable however shoot up to 1.3120 after Parliament accepted the Brady&rsquo;s amendment requiring the backstop to be replaced with an alternative arrangement; gains were quickly pared back as this will mean PM May will have to reopen negotiations with the EU on the WA and backstop and the EU has already opposed this option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The broad Usd and index have found their footing as the clock ticks down to the 1st FOMC meeting of the year and markets also eye the impending US-China trade talks amidst reports of progress from pre-high level delegation negotiations. The Greenback is now only softer vs the Gbp, Nzd and Cad having reversed losses against the Eur, Jpy, Aud, and Chf in particular. Looking at individual prices, Nzd/Usd is back near the middle of a 0.6815-60 range, Aud/Usd around 0.7150 and Usd/Chf just rebounded a few pips over 0.9950 vs nearer 0.9910 at one stage. Eur/Usd ultimately topped out around 1.1450 towards 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>More divergence between the Scandi Crowns as the Nok continues to derive support from an ongoing recovery in crude prices vs the Sek taking on board more Riksbank commentary highlighting no rush to hike rates again (in contrast to the Norges Bank that remains on track to continue its tightening cycle in March). Eur/Nok sub-9.7050, Eur/Sek 10.3500+.</p>\r\n",

Analysts at Citi are also citing background support for oil prices from &ldquo;the OPEC+ production cuts and, in particular Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s announced intention to reduce output to 10.1mln bpd for February, a step below the 10.31mln bpd official target and roughly 1.0mln bpd below their November peak&rdquo;. This over 2% rise in futures has come ahead of the upcoming API figures, wherein forecasters expect a stockpile growth (of 3.2mln barrels) for the 9th straight week, with gasoline inventories also seen increasing (by 1.9mln barrels) and distillate stocks declining (by 1.4mln barrels).</p>\r\n",

The latter are widely seen as the key 7 (A, B, G, I, J, N and O - listed in more detail on our headline feed at 13.50GMT), and individual Parties are already pledging support for certain amendments, but perhaps more poignant is the fact that the EU has reiterated it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. Nevertheless, the Pound is hedging bets or hoping for more unity in Whitehall and for PM May to emerge with enough backing for the Brady amendment, with Cable hovering just below 1.3200 and Eur/Gbp back down towards the base of a 0.8710-0.8655 range. On a &lsquo;positive&rsquo; result, Cable may look to take out yesterday&rsquo;s best (1.3218) before eyeing resistance at 1.3235, 1.3259 and then 1.3295.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Usd and index have found their footing as the clock ticks down to the 1st FOMC meeting of the year and markets also eye the impending US-China trade talks amidst reports of progress from pre-high level delegation negotiations. The Greenback is now only softer vs the Gbp, Nzd and Cad having reversed losses against the Eur, Jpy, Aud, and Chf in particular. Looking at individual prices, Nzd/Usd is back near the middle of a 0.6815-60 range, Aud/Usd has slipped back below 0.7150 and Usd/Chf just rebounded a few pips over 0.9950 vs nearer 0.9910 at one stage. Eur/Usd ultimately topped out around 1.1450 and now looks prone to retesting 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More divergence between the Scandi Crowns as the Nok continues to derive support from an ongoing recovery in crude prices vs the Sek taking on board more Riksbank commentary highlighting no rush to hike rates again (in contrast to the Norges Bank that remains on track to continue its tightening cycle in March). Eur/Nok sub-9.7050, Eur/Sek 10.3500+.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) was negative on return from the extended weekend with the index dragged lower by underperformance in healthcare as Resmed shares tumbled on poor sales figures and with energy names pressured by the recent 3% drop in oil prices, while price action in the Nikkei 225 (Unch.) was at the whim of the JPY-risk dynamic. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) weakened after the US announced charges against Huawei including intellectual property theft, as well as bank and wire fraud, although markets gradually rebounded off lows as focus shifted to the upcoming trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as prices failed to benefit from the weakness across stocks, while a mixed 40yr JGB auction also failed to provide a catalyst for direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is expected to oppose US demands for structural changes in the next round of trade discussions and sides are said to remain divided, although it was also reported that China is planning to offer a large increase in US farm and energy purchases, as well as modest industrial policy reforms. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He arrived in Washingotn DC ahead of January 30th-31st trade discussions, while the Chinese delegation includes PBoC Govenor Yi Gang, China&rsquo;s Vice Finance Minister and the NDRC Vice Chairman among others. (Newswires) US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expects to make significant progress at trade talks with the Chinese delegation this week and noted enforcement will be a top priority for trade talks.

Sectors are mixed, with outperformance seen in consumer staples, largely due to the aforementioned British American Tobacco and Unilever. Other notable movers include Royal Mail (-10.5%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings, whilst Sartorius (+16.0%) are at the top of the index following a double digit increase to their 2018 sales revenue and earnings. Separately, SAP (-2.0%) are down in spite of the Co. raising their 2020 non-IFRS revenue outlook and confirming their non-IFRS profit outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/EUR - The Kiwi is back in pole position and just outperforming G10 peers like the Euro that is also benefiting from some cross-flows, and a generally soft US Dollar. Nzd/Usd is back up around 0.6850, with some support emanating from NZ trade data overnight alongside ongoing Aud/Nzd selling as the pair delves deeper below 1.0500 (to circa 1.0450 at one stage). Note, Aud/Usd was undermined by a sharp deterioration in NAB business conditions, but subsequently derived some traction to pare losses from 0.7140 to 0.7175 on the back of broadly upbeat comments from RBA&rsquo;s Harper who reiterated guidance for the next policy move to be a hike based on strength in the Aussie jobs market and the country&rsquo;s healthy budget situation. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd has inched a bit further above 1.1400 to test its 100 DMA (1.1446) having cleared a 50% Fib (1.1430), but not quite able to breach 1.1450 and challenge the next upside chart resistance at 1.1463 (61.8% Fib). Note also, the single currency may encounter option-related offers ahead of 1 bn expiries at 1.1465-75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/CHF/JPY - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Loonie draws some solace from relative calm in the oil/commodity complex and recovers towards 1.3250, while Cable is pivoting 1.3150 and awaiting the outcome of UK Parliament&rsquo;s vote on Brexit Plan B alongside amendments, but the Pound still trading weaker vs the Euro on customary month end factors (Eur/Gbp RHS demand lifting the cross over 0.8700 earlier). Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy are just off Monday&rsquo;s lows within narrow ranges of 0.9910-25 and 109.15-45 respectively, with the Franc not really reacting to Swiss trade data even though the surplus shrank substantially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as the Nok also derives comfort from a partial recovery in crude prices vs the Sek acknowledging more Riksbank commentary highlighting no rush to hike rates again (vs the Norges Bank on course to continue its tightening cycle in March). Eur/Nok sub-9.7150, Eur/Sek 10.3500+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After earlier flurries of activity, some relative calm has descended on debt futures approaching midday in Europe. Gilts have recovered a bit of poise from a fractional new 122.99 Liffe base, but still marginally lagging Bunds that are hugging the 165.00 line after a moderately weaker Schatz auction than the previous 2 year German offering. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are also essentially straddling parity, awaiting more supply, scheduled releases and any further news on the amended calendar for data suspended during the record 35 day Government shutdown on day 1 of the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.0%) and WTI (+0.9%) prices are higher, and around the USD 60/bbl and USD 52/bbl level respectively, after somewhat pairing back the sessions initial losses; as the risk sentiment has improved from yesterday. US have imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aiming to significantly reduce their crude exports to the US; additionally, trying to pressure President Maduro into stepping down. Elsewhere, Nord Stream 2, a new gas export pipeline running from Russia to Europe, continues in discussions to raise EUR 6bln in financing. Separately, Total have announced a significant new discovery in the North Sea, which has an estimated 250mln barrels of oil equivalent of recoverable resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is in the green, benefitting from dollar weakness amidst an uneventful overnight session; with the yellow metal towards its session high of USD 1309.4/oz. Following the lifting of sanctions against Rusal, the LME has begun accepting aluminium deliveries from the Co. into their warehouses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuela President Maduro said US is stealing CITGO and that they will begin legal action, while Venezuela also ordered PDVSA customers with tankers waiting to load US-bound crude, to prepay cargoes or they will not be delivered.

Sectors are mixed, with outperformance seen in consumer staples, largely due to the aforementioned British American Tobacco and Unilever. Other notable movers include Royal Mail (-10.5%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings, whilst Sartorius (+16.0%) are at the top of the index following a double digit increase to their 2018 sales revenue and earnings. Separately, SAP (-2.0%) are down in spite of the Co. raising their 2020 non-IFRS revenue outlook and confirming their non-IFRS profit outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/EUR - The Kiwi is back in pole position and just outperforming G10 peers like the Euro that is also benefiting from some cross-flows, and a generally soft US Dollar. Nzd/Usd is back up around 0.6850, with some support emanating from NZ trade data overnight alongside ongoing Aud/Nzd selling as the pair delves deeper below 1.0500 (to circa 1.0450 at one stage). Note, Aud/Usd was undermined by a sharp deterioration in NAB business conditions, but subsequently derived some traction to pare losses from 0.7140 to 0.7175 on the back of broadly upbeat comments from RBA&rsquo;s Harper who reiterated guidance for the next policy move to be a hike based on strength in the Aussie jobs market and the country&rsquo;s healthy budget situation. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd has inched a bit further above 1.1400 to test its 100 DMA (1.1446) having cleared a 50% Fib (1.1430), but not quite able to breach 1.1450 and challenge the next upside chart resistance at 1.1463 (61.8% Fib). Note also, the single currency may encounter option-related offers ahead of 1 bn expiries at 1.1465-75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/CHF/JPY - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Loonie draws some solace from relative calm in the oil/commodity complex and recovers towards 1.3250, while Cable is pivoting 1.3150 and awaiting the outcome of UK Parliament&rsquo;s vote on Brexit Plan B alongside amendments, but the Pound still trading weaker vs the Euro on customary month end factors (Eur/Gbp RHS demand lifting the cross over 0.8700 earlier). Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy are just off Monday&rsquo;s lows within narrow ranges of 0.9910-25 and 109.15-45 respectively, with the Franc not really reacting to Swiss trade data even though the surplus shrank substantially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as the Nok also derives comfort from a partial recovery in crude prices vs the Sek acknowledging more Riksbank commentary highlighting no rush to hike rates again (vs the Norges Bank on course to continue its tightening cycle in March). Eur/Nok sub-9.7150, Eur/Sek 10.3500+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10-year German debt future has rebounded further from Monday&rsquo;s lows in line with a partial recovery in US Treasuries amidst marginal curve re-flattening, and as broader risk sentiment remains fragile/tentative going into the first of this week&rsquo;s major events &ndash; UK Parliamentary vote on Plan B. As usual, the outcome is highly uncertain and merely adds to the potential mix of threats to the global economy pending the next round of US-China trade talks. Back to Bunds, the benchmark just edged a fresh session best at 165.09 (+18 ticks) having kicked off at 164.94 and posting a 164.85 overnight Eurex low. Also ahead, Eur 5bn Schatz supply to absorb, but likely to be taken down relatively smoothly given ECB rate hike guidance tilting beyond the official &lsquo;at least through Summer 2019&rsquo; time-line, and markets already pricing out any tightening this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10-year UK benchmark just dipped a bit further into negative territory and posted a marginal new Liffe low of 122.99, after opening at 123.15 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 123.11 close and carving out an early 123.34 peak, as yields consolidate off their lows. Trade is understandably edgy and volatile ahead of the looming Brexit vote, although the FTSE is benefiting from relative Gbp weakness and this may also be weighing on Gilts to an extent. Turning to STIR contracts, a steadier start to Tuesday&rsquo;s session with the 3 month strip holding above parity, albeit now 1-2 ticks off best levels amidst some decent activity in options featuring call spreads (Mar19 99.125/25 in 6k+ lots and Jun19/20 99.00 in 5.75k lots).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.9%) and WTI (+0.9%) prices are higher, and around the USD 60/bbl and USD 52/bbl level respectively, after somewhat pairing back the sessions initial losses; as the risk sentiment has improved from yesterday. US have imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aiming to significantly reduce their crude exports to the US; additionally, trying to pressure President Maduro into stepping down. Elsewhere, Nord Stream 2, a new gas export pipeline running from Russia to Europe, continues in discussions to raise EUR 6bln in financing. Separately, Total have announced a significant new discovery in the North Sea, which has an estimated 250mln barrels of oil equivalent of recoverable resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.4%) is in the green, benefitting from dollar weakness amidst an uneventful overnight session; with the yellow metal towards its session high of USD 1309.4/oz. Following the lifting of sanctions against Rusal, the LME has begun accepting aluminium deliveries from the Co. into their warehouses.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>NZD/AUD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is back in pole position and just outperforming G10 peers like the Euro that is also benefiting from some cross-flows, and a generally soft US Dollar. Nzd/Usd is back up around 0.6850, with some support emanating from NZ trade data overnight alongside ongoing Aud/Nzd selling as the pair delves deeper below 1.0500 (to circa 1.0450 at one stage). Note, Aud/Usd was undermined by a sharp deterioration in NAB business conditions, but subsequently derived some traction to pare losses from 0.7140 to 0.7175 on the back of broadly upbeat comments from RBA&rsquo;s Harper who reiterated guidance for the next policy move to be a hike based on strength in the Aussie jobs market and the country&rsquo;s healthy budget situation. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd has inched a bit further above 1.1400 to test its 100 DMA (1.1446) having cleared a 50% Fib (1.1430), but not quite able to breach 1.1450 and challenge the next upside chart resistance at 1.1463 (61.8% Fib). Note also, the single currency may encounter option-related offers ahead of 1 bn expiries at 1.1465-75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Loonie draws some solace from relative calm in the oil/commodity complex and recovers towards 1.3250, while Cable is pivoting 1.3150 and awaiting the outcome of UK Parliament&rsquo;s vote on Brexit Plan B alongside amendments, but the Pound still trading weaker vs the Euro on customary month end factors (Eur/Gbp RHS demand lifting the cross over 0.8700 earlier). Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy are just off Monday&rsquo;s lows within narrow ranges of 0.9910-25 and 109.15-45 respectively, with the Franc not really reacting to Swiss trade data even though the surplus shrank substantially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as the Nok also derives comfort from a partial recovery in crude prices vs the Sek acknowledging more Riksbank commentary highlighting no rush to hike rates again (vs the Norges Bank on course to continue its tightening cycle in March). Eur/Nok sub-9.7150, Eur/Sek 10.3500+.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) was negative on return from the extended weekend with the index dragged lower by underperformance in healthcare as Resmed shares tumbled on poor sales figures and with energy names pressured by the recent 3% drop in oil prices, while price action in the Nikkei 225 (Unch.) was at the whim of the JPY-risk dynamic. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) weakened after the US announced charges against Huawei including intellectual property theft, as well as bank and wire fraud, although markets gradually rebounded off lows as focus shifted to the upcoming trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as prices failed to benefit from the weakness across stocks, while a mixed 40yr JGB auction also failed to provide a catalyst for direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7356 (Prev. 6.7472)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Department of Justice is formally seeking the extradition of Huawei&#39;s CFO to the US and announced a 13-count indictment including bank and wire fraud charges against Huawei, while there was an additional 10-count indictment against the Co. for conspiring to steal intellectual property from T-Mobile. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Foreign Ministry expressed serious concern regarding US charges on Huawei and its CFO, whilst strongly urging the US to halt unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies and asked US to withdraw arrest order for Huawei&#39;s CFO. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao said China will continue to lower taxes and fees for SMEs, while China will also significantly reduce the investment negative list. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is expected to oppose US demands for structural changes in the next round of trade discussions and sides are said to remain divided, although it was also reported that China is planning to offer a large increase in US farm and energy purchases, as well as modest industrial policy reforms. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He arrived in Washingotn DC ahead of January 30th-31st trade discussions, while the Chinese delegation includes PBoC Govenor Yi Gang, China&rsquo;s Vice Finance Minister and the NDRC Vice Chairman among others. (Newswires) US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expects to make significant progress at trade talks with the Chinese delegation this week and noted enforcement will be a top priority for trade talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources said PM May told a meeting of Tory MPs that the motion for the Meaningful Vote will be laid on Feb 13th and there will then be two days of debate before the vote which could occur on the evening of Feb 14th. In addition, there were separate reports that UK PM May is said to promise MPs another chance to vote against a no-deal. (Newswires/Telegraph/Twitter) A minimum of 270 UK MPs have publicly declared their opposition to UK exiting the EU without a deal, while over 60 more signaled they could defy UK PM May over the issue ahead of today&#39;s vote on the Brexit &quot;Plan B&quot;. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May was said to urge Tory MPs to back the Brady amendment which would replace the backstop with alternative arrangements, while an MP said that the government will whip its MPs to vote for the Brady amendment. In related news, there had been earlier comments from Jacob Rees-Mogg that the ERG will not support the Brady amendment, although Brexiters in and around the ERG reportedly told ITV&#39;s political editor they could vote for the PM&rsquo;s Brexit deal if she tables an amendment similar but more tightly worded than Brady&rsquo;s which pledges to ask the EU to reopen the WA and dump the backstop. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telegraph&#39;s Deputy Political Editor tweeted that those behind the Cooper amendment which requires government to extend Article 50 in the event a deal can&#39;t be reached, said it is going to be &#39;nail-bitingly close&#39;.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major currencies were uneventful amid a sparse calendar and tentativeness heading into this week&rsquo;s key risk events, with the DXY virtually unchanged below the 96.00 level. The greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts also struggled for direction with EUR/USD flat at the 1.1400 handle and with GBP/USD subdued ahead of today&rsquo;s Parliamentary vote on PM May&rsquo;s Brexit &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo;. Elsewhere, antipodeans were initially lacklustre with AUD/USD momentarily pressured after NAB Business Conditions declined to its lowest since 2015, while USD/JPY was stuck near the prior day&rsquo;s lows as the predominantly risk-averse tone clouded over the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian NAB Business Conditions Dec 2 (Prev. 11.0). (Newswires)<br />Australian NAB Business Confidence Dec 3 (Prev. 3.0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which WTI crude futures partially nursed losses overnight to trade back above the USD 52.00/bbl, which provided some reprieve from the prior day&rsquo;s 3% drop that had been attributed to the subdued risk sentiment and the re-opening of Libyan ports. Elsewhere, gold mirrored the uneventful price action in the greenback and plateaued just above USD 1300/oz, while copper traded sideways before finding mild support as stocks rebounded from lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US National Security Advisor confirmed the US is to impose sanctions on Venezuela&#39;s PDVSA and stated that USD 7bln in assets will be blocked. In related news, US Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin said the Treasury is to issue temporary licences to permit some transactions with PDVSA and said that US refineries can continue to operate using Venezuelan oil, while he added that oil supplies are sufficient to ensure no significant impact on US gas prices in short term. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuela President Maduro said US is stealing CITGO and that they will begin legal action, while Venezuela also ordered PDVSA customers with tankers waiting to load US-bound crude, to prepay cargoes or they will not be delivered. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US government is considering the release of oil from US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to coincide with possible sanction imposed on Venezuela&#39;s exports. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries started the week marginally higher as stocks were sliding amid disappointing earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and cut in Q4 guidance for Nvidia (NVDA). Yields were lower by c.1bps across the curve at settlement; the complex recovered some losses after the auctions albeit remaining in negative territory. The curve, which saw some modest flattening earlier in the day, steepened after the auctions on some long-end selling. The US sold USD 40bln in 2-year notes on Monday at the lowest yield since June 2018, stopping through by 0.6bps with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.56x; primary dealers took the smallest share since January 2018 and indirect bidders took the largest since then. The US also sold USD 41bln of 5-year notes at the lowest yield since January 2018, stopping through by 0.6bps with a bid-to-cover of 2.41x. Overall a robust auction; primary dealers took the smallest share since last July, direct bidders took the largest share since July 2014, indirect bidders took the largest share since last August.<br />US T-note futures (H9) settled ticks 3 higher at 121-16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House Speaker Pelosi invited President Trump to give State of the Union Address on February 5th, which President Trump accepted.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade lower as the region follows suit to the negativity on Wall St where sentiment was dampened by corporate updates in which industrial bellwether Caterpillar missed on earnings and Nvidia reduced its guidance. ASX 200 (-0.6%) is negative on return from the extended weekend with the index dragged lower by underperformance in healthcare as Resmed shares tumble on poor sales figures and with energy names also pressured by the recent 3% drop in oil prices, while losses in the Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are at the whim of the JPY-risk dynamic. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) also weakened after the US announced charges against Huawei including intellectual property theft, as well as bank and wire fraud which some fear could impact this week&rsquo;s trade discussions. In addition, reports suggested China is expected to oppose US demands for structural changes and that the sides remain divided, although China is said to be planning to offer a large increase in US farm and energy purchases, as well as modest industrial policy reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major currencies are flat amid a sparse calendar and tentativeness heading into this week&rsquo;s key risk events, with the DXY virtually unchanged below the 96.00 level. The greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts also struggle for direction with EUR/USD at the 1.1400 handle and with GBP/USD subdued ahead of today&rsquo;s Parliamentary vote on PM May&rsquo;s Brexit &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo;, in which MPs will first get to decide on several amendments. Elsewhere, antipodeans are lacklustre with AUD/USD momentarily pressured after NAB Business Conditions declined to its lowest since 2015, while USD/JPY is stuck near the prior day&rsquo;s lows as the risk averse tone continues to support the safe-haven JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat after having failed to benefit from the weakness across stocks, while participants are also sidelined ahead of a 40yr JGB auction later.</p>\r\n",
