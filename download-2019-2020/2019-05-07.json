American insurance Group (AIG) finished with strong gains as the insurer posted strong earnings. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were under pressure after reporting earnings that missed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Allergan (AGN) also performed poorly on the day, despite reporting a beat on both the top and bottom lines. At the other end of the tech sector spectrum, Henry Schien (HSIC) finished the session with respectable gains after the health care distributor beat analyst expectation on both the top and bottom line by a significant amount. On the slightly more absurd side of things, a Starbucks coffee cup made a fleeting, albeit accidental, cameo in one of the most recent episodes of the highly popular Game of Thrones television show, with producers not noticing the cups presence in the shot. Starbucks reportedly received ‘millions’ in free advertising and amid all the social media buzz, managed to finish the session only slightly in the red. Disney (DIS) managed to avoid the worst of the sell off, finishing the session flat amid the continued after-glow of another spectacular weekend of ‘Avengers: Endgame’ box office sales and the film maker announced dates for the next 3 Star Wars films.

There was upside in the European morning after the European Commission's latest forecasts saw Germany growth view cut, while warning of Euro area risks. And in the European afternoon, the equity price slide gave a further boost to the T-Note. The US sold USD 38bln of 3-year notes, in a weak offering, which tailed by 0.7bps, and cover a touch softer than recent averages; direct bidders ended-up taking their largest share of a 3s auction since 2014. At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch flatter. US T-notes (M9) futures settled 12 ticks higher at 124-00+</p>",

However, the patience may have a limit; China's Global Times editor (often used as a proxy for the China government's own position said \"the possibility of an escalation of China-US trade war is seriously increasing, the situation is more tense than the Western media speculated.\" While there was a turnaround on Monday trade after traders suggested that the latest outburst from the President might just be rhetoric to try and speed up negotiations, his comments have been followed-up by other policy makers: US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that 90% of the pact had been finalised, and the US was unwilling to re-negotiate previous commitments; Politico, citing sources, also reported that Senior White House officials described US President Trump as deadly serious about increasing the tariffs on China, and one senior official reportedly said \"We have leverage. They have more to lose\". Elsewhere, India is back in focus: US Commerce Secretary Ross notes that retaliation by India will not be appropriate if the US withdraws trade privileges for India, with the remarks following Ross' previous view that the trade imbalance with India must be addresses. And from the European perspective, EC President Juncker noted that nothing has changed on trade with the US since his last visit to Washington in July, adding that the EU can trust US President Trump on trade relations with the EU.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May has been facing renewed calls to step-down as she attempts to secure a deal with Labour to break the Brexit deadlock. Some of her Tory party are concerned about her pivot towards a (\"temporary\") Customs Union - which has already been rejected in indicative votes, and would make it harder for the UK to negotiate trade deals with other nations. Ahead of her meeting with the influential backbench 1922 Committee, a member of that committee is said to have told the ITV that if chair Graham Brady returned from the meeting without a firm departure date for UK PM May, 'he will be sent back' - and as the meeting was occurring, reports emerged that the Committee is now tied on whether to change rules to remove PM May earlier than the one year grace period she had won after winning a confidence vote on her leadership (there was some suggestion May could take legal action to prevent this, though this was denied by the PM's spokesperson). Elsewhere, BBC said that key to achieving an agreement in the cross-party talks is the promise of this 'temporary customs union', though Labour sources have warned that if this is all there is, it is what is already encompassed in the Withdrawal Agreement. Nevertheless, other sources said that it is more likely now that Labour will do some kind of a deal, despite reports that a whole agreement has not yet been reached.</p><p><strong>* US JOLTS: </strong>Jolts rebounded in March, following a decline in February. 7.488mln job openings were reported against a previous 7.142mln (upward revision). The job openings rate was up by 0.2ppts to 4.7%, the hiring rate was unchanged at 3.8%, the quits rate was unchanged at 2.3%, and the layoff rate fell 0.1ppts to 1.1%. The rebound in job openings was fairly broad based, but the latest JOLTS report still remains below the 2018Q4 average, Goldman Sachs noted.</p><p><strong>* US IBD/TIPP: </strong>Economic optimism jumped to a 15-year high. \"Despite political gamesmanship and partisan divides, Americans believe the economy is a clear bright spot,\" IBD said, \"there have been ripples of uncertainty over the past several months, but with May's Economic Optimism Index hitting a 15-year high, consumers have seemingly moved past their doubts on the issue that directly impacts their pocketbook.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Clarida (Voter, Neutral) said the US economy was in a good place, and added that he sees temporary factors in recent soft inflation. Crucially, Clarida said the Fed does not see a strong case to move rates in either direction, echoing the remarks of Fed Chair Powell last week. The Fed's immediate focus was on getting inflation back to 2.0%, Clarida said, and the Fed will adjust policy accordingly in order to meet that objective. On trade, Clarida said it had not had a large economic impact so far. However, Fed's Kaplan (non-voter, dove), however, said trade uncertainty was impacting firms' supply chains, and he has concerns that global growth was decelerating. On rates, he toed the line, and said he would currently stand pat and doesn't see a need to lower rates to address inflation, while he doesn't have a bias for the direction of the next rate move. Kaplan also said he had been trying to flag issue of risky corporate debt which could be a burden on the economy in a downturn; and on the US economy, he expects it to remain healthy, and repeated that he does not see a recession coming, adding that the US should start to moderate debt growth.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.85 LOWER AT USD 61.40/BBL; BRENT (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.36 LOWER AT USD 69.88/BBL</strong>. Crude was lower on Tuesday, taking its cue from global risk sentiment (which was soggy, soured by the twist of tone in the US/China trade talks). US Energy Sec Perry said that Saudi Arabia was raising production in order to counter Iran sanctions impact, and said the message for US' allies around the world was clear: do not do business with Iran. Iran itself on Tuesday said that it was close to an oil sales deal with the EU, despite the re-imposition of US sanctions on buyers of Iranian crude. Following yesterday’s news that the US is to move an aircraft carrier to the Gulf region, news emerged that the US was also to send B-52 bomber to the region, whilst Iran made clear its intention to back off from the 2015 nuclear deal, and will announce ‘diminishing commitments’ to the deal on Wednesday. Regarding Russian oil supplies through the Druzhba Pipeline to Poland, though supplies through Germany remain suspended; the Russian energy minister Novak said he expects that the oil quality issue will have normalised in second half of May. Meanwhile, Russian April seaborne oil exports rose by 8.8% vs March. EIA STEO saw the organisation raise its forecast for 2019 global oil demand by +20k BPD (now sees a 1.38mln BPD Y/Y increase); for 2020, it raises forecast for global oil demand +80k BPD (to 1.53mln BPD Y/Y increase); The EIA forecasts US oil demand to rise +250k in 2019 (down from prior expectations of +360k rise), and by +280k in 2020 (up from prior expectations of +250k BPD rise). Meanwhile, it sees US crude output to +930k BPD in 2020 (compared to previous expectation of +710k BPD).</p><p><strong>* SPX -1.7% at 2884, NDX -2% at 7640, DJI -1.8% at 25966.

American insurance Group (AIG) finished with strong gains as the insurer posted strong earnings. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were under pressure after reporting earnings that missed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Allergan (AGN) also performed poorly on the day, despite reporting a beat on both the top and bottom lines. At the other end of the tech sector spectrum, Henry Schien (HSIC) finished the session with respectable gains after the health care distributor beat analyst expectation on both the top and bottom line by a significant amount. On the slightly more absurd side of things, a Starbucks coffee cup made a fleeting, albeit accidental, cameo in one of the most recent episodes of the highly popular Game of Thrones television show, with producers not noticing the cups presence in the shot. Starbucks reportedly received ‘millions’ in free advertising and amid all the social media buzz, managed to finish the session only slightly in the red. Disney (DIS) managed to avoid the worst of the sell off, finishing the session flat amid the continued after-glow of another spectacular weekend of ‘Avengers: Endgame’ box office sales and the film maker announced dates for the next 3 Star Wars films.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (M9) FUTURES SETTLE 12 TICKS HIGHER AT 124-00+: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-flattened on Tuesday, as risk aversion lent a bid to the complex. There was upside in the European morning after the European Commission's latest forecasts saw Germany growth view cut, while warning of Euro area risks. And in the European afternoon, the equity price slide gave a further boost to the T-Note. The US sold USD 38bln of 3-year notes, in a weak offering, which tailed by 0.7bps, and cover a touch softer than recent averages; direct bidders ended-up taking their largest share of a 3s auction since 2014. At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch flatter.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong>; the DXY was stronger on risk aversion, as scepticism build surrounding US/Sino trade negotiations; decent US JOLTs job openings and economic optimism data were background factors, doing little to drive price action despite firm readings. <strong>JPY</strong> was the star performer on the day; the European and US equites sell-off spurring flows into the safe haven asset, leading to USDJPY hitting fresh one-month lows. <strong>EUR; </strong>weakened in tango with a strengthening dollar on trade tensions concerns, with German Industrial order data, EC economic projections and comments from Salvini regarding the Italian deficit doing little to lift sentiment. <strong>AUD </strong>trades higher, with shorts squeezed after the RBA left rates unchanged overnight (there had been many calling for a rate cut at the meeting); the currency drifted lower through Europe and US trade on weak risk sentiment. <strong>NZD </strong>ahead of the RBNZ rate decision (40% chance of rate cut), the Kiwi traded lower, with global risk sentiment also weighing. <strong>Commodity FX</strong> were all under pressure as the crude complex fell.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude was lower on Tuesday, taking its cue from global risk sentiment (which was soggy, soured by the twist of tone in the US/China trade talks). US Energy Sec Perry said that Saudi Arabia was raising production in order to counter Iran sanctions impact, and said the message for US' allies around the world was clear: do not do business with Iran. Iran itself on Tuesday said that it was close to an oil sales deal with the EU, despite the re-imposition of US sanctions on buyers of Iranian crude. Following yesterday’s news that the US is to move an aircraft carrier to the Gulf region, news emerged that the US was also to send B-52 bomber to the region, whilst Iran made clear its intention to back off from the 2015 nuclear deal, and will announce ‘diminishing commitments’ to the deal on Wednesday. Regarding Russian oil supplies through the Druzhba Pipeline to Poland, though supplies through Germany remain suspended; the Russian energy minister Novak said he expects that the oil quality issue will have normalised in second half of May. Meanwhile, Russian April seaborne oil exports rose by 8.8% vs March. EIA STEO saw the organisation raise its forecast for 2019 global oil demand by +20k BPD (now sees a 1.38mln BPD Y/Y increase); for 2020, it raises forecast for global oil demand +80k BPD (to 1.53mln BPD Y/Y increase); The EIA forecasts US oil demand to rise +250k in 2019 (down from prior expectations of +360k rise), and by +280k in 2020 (up from prior expectations of +250k BPD rise). Meanwhile, it sees US crude output to +930k BPD in 2020 (compared to previous expectation of +710k BPD).</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and DXY by default, are back on a firmer footing amidst ongoing uncertainty and concerns about the fate of US-China trade talks as the clock ticks down to Friday’s deadline for more widespread and punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. The index has rebounded from another sub-97.500 sortie ahead of key negotiations on Thursday and Friday that will either prevent another Usd200 bn Chinese goods being subject to an increased 25% tariff from 10% now or end in disharmony and potentially spark a full blown trade war. The DXY is just off a new session high of 97.722 and the Buck now firmer than all its major peers aside from the Aussie and Yen.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie has erased almost all post-RBA gains vs its US counterpart and drifted back down closer to 0.7000 on the aforementioned heightened US-Chinese trade angst, but retains a solid advantage against the Kiwi above the 1.0600 handle on relative RBA/RBNZ policy outlooks given expectations that the NZ Cash Rate is more likely to be reduced overnight than the OCR. For a full preview of the forthcoming meeting check out the Ransquawk Research Suite and our headline feed nearer the event. Note, Nzd/Usd is currently sub-0.6600 with options pricing a break-even of circa 75 pips ahead of the RBNZ verdict. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy continues to back off from recent 111.00 or close to the big figure highs through 110.50, but not quite far enough to threaten the top of an option expiry band spanning 110.00-40 in 1.3 bn.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>Ending Tuesday’s EU session as the biggest G10 losers as the Franc slips back below 1.0200 vs the Dollar and 1.1425 against the single currency, while the Pound has been plagued by renewed Brexit-related jitters after the long UK holiday weekend as UK PM May resumes Cabinet meetings under pressure to name her departure date and cross-party talks continue with the Labour Party. Cable is back down below 1.3100 and not far from the next round number having breached the 100 HMA (1.3077), and Eur/Gbp has rebounded towards the top of a 0.8538-81 range and through the psychological 0.8550 level.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Also victims of the broad downturn in risk sentiment noted above, with the Loonie and Norwegian Krona also undermined by another retreat in crude prices and the Swedish Crown acknowledging weak new manufacturing orders alongside dovish Riksbank minutes. Usd/Cad is currently around 1.3475, Eur/Nok over 9.7800 and Eur/Sek above 10.7200 again.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>A relative outperformer or at least displaying a degree of resistance vs the Usd within 1.1175-1.1220 trading parameters, with the 30 DMA (1.1226) capping the upside and decent option expiries at 1.1150 (1.1 bn) providing some underlying support in wake of more sub-forecast German data and EC projections downgrading GDP outlooks and raising Italy’s 2019 deficit estimate.</p>",

Nonetheless, there was no lack of success stories in Japan with Sony among the biggest gainers after having waited through a 10-day closure to finally benefit from a return to profit in Q4 and with SoftBank boosted as it considers an IPO for its USD 100bln Vision Fund. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.2%)</strong> was positive with the index led by strength in mining names and after mostly encouraging Trade Balance and Retail Sales data, while some participants were also hopeful for a rate cut by the RBA although this failed to materialize and subsequently saw the index give back some of the gains. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.5%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) </strong>nursed some of the prior day’s sell-off in which the mainland bourse had dropped nearly 6% due to the heightened trade tensions. Furthermore, the recovery also followed a substantial rebound on Wall St after reports that the China delegation will still travel to Washington D.C. provided a glimmer of hope, although this was later clouded after-hours as US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer confirmed a deterioration in negotiations and that tariffs will be increased if there is no agreement by Friday.

The FTSE 100 (-0.2%) is mildly lagging its peers as UK markets return from a bank holiday, and as such are reacting to the US-China trade updates; although, downside in the index is limited by the likes of Vodafone (+1.4%) and AstraZeneca (+1.5%) in the green after making a deal with Telefonica Deutschland (+2.2%) and announcing that their Phase 3 Calquence study achieved its primary endpoints respectively. Sectors are similarly mixed with energy names down in tandem with the oil complex, and notably the auto sector is once again in the red dragged down by heavyweight BMW (-1.0%) post-earnings. Following the Co. posted Q1 EBIT significantly lower than the prior levels and that the Co. have set aside EUR 1.4bln for anti-trust provisions after the Co. were previously warned of a significant charge resulting from an EU probe into collusion over delaying the implementation of cleaner-emissions cars. Other notable movers this morning include, AB Inbev (-0.1%) who at first fell around 1% at the open due to a slight miss on Q1 revenues and stating that short term dividend growth will be impacted deleveraging commitments. However, Co’s shares subsequently retraced much of this downside after stating that they are considering the IPO of their Asia-Pacific unit in Hong Kong, which could reportedly value the business at up to USD 40-70bln. In contrast, Infineon (-0.3%) initially moved higher by around 1.3% but gave up much of this surge as the Co. initially posted a beat on Q2 revenues but did emphasise that the market environment remains competitive.</p><p>FX</p><p>AUD/NZD - Aud/Usd is firmly back above 0.7000, albeit off overnight recovery highs circa 0.7050, while Aud/Nzd remains nearer the top of its range (1.0640+) having reclaimed 1.0600 status from a low of 1.0575 ahead of the eagerly awaited RBA policy meeting. In sum, the OCR was maintained at 1.5% and the accompanying statement struck a less dovish tone than most were anticipating as rate expectations were finely balanced between 51% for on hold and the remainder predicting a 25 bp ease. However, the Bank reiterated that strength in the labour market outweighed weakness in wages and inflation, supporting the decision to stand pat again and monitor data/economic developments (domestic and external). Conversely, Nzd/Usd has drifted back down towards 0.6600 as the spotlight switches to the RBNZ amidst even greater expectations that an ease is in the offing – see the Ransquawk headline feed for a more detailed preview.</p><p>SEK/NOK - The next best performing G10 currencies as the Swedish Krona rebounds from recent lows vs the Euro through 10.7000 on a broad stabilisation in risk sentiment and despite Riksbank minutes reaffirming the more dovish shift at the last policy meeting. Similarly, the Nok has pared losses to trade back above 9.7500 against the Eur and the backdrop of steadier oil prices.</p><p>EM - The Cnh is consolidating off Monday’s lows around 6.7750 vs 6.8000+ in wake of reports that China’s Vice Premier Lui will attend the next round of trade talks in Washington and the perception if not reality that his presence improves the chances that an agreement will be reached in time to avoid the 25% tariffs on a further Usd200 bn goods threatened by US President Trump over the weekend. However, this has not done much to lift the gloom for the Try as the Istanbul rerun is not due until June 23 and as such the uncertain domestic political scene will remain for another 1 1/2 months at least. The Lira has consolidated off a 6.2000 base vs the Dollar, but Turkish assets are still underperforming and looking vulnerable.</p><p>GBP/EUR/JPY/CAD - All relatively flat vs. the buck as news-flow somewhat slowed in EU trade, albeit Brexit remains in the background with Labour leader Corbyn not partaking to today’s cross-party talks, whilst PM May is speculated to receive her departure date before the 1922 committee. Sky News’ Rigby did however note that prospects have increased for a cross-party deal, citing a Cabinet source. Cable largely was unreactive to a technical speech by Cunliffe on post-Brexit financial stability. GBP/USD remains below the 1.3100 handle (having fallen below its 50 DMA around the figure), with the next technical at its 100 HMA at 1.3077. Elsewhere, the single currency remains just around the 1.1200 level, with the European Commission Spring Forecast pushed back to around 11:30BST due to an earlier speech by the Commission’s President. The focus of the release will be Italy as press reported that the EC may warn of widening Italian budget deficit to 2.6% of GDP, above the government’s forecast of 2.4%. Moving on, the Loonie straddles just below 1.3500 vs. the Greenback ahead of Ivey PMIs later. Elsewhere, JPY remains sub-111 vs. the Buck, holding onto most of its post-Trump risk premia ahead of further trade talks this week with Vice Premier Liu He now attending, signalling high-level talks. USD/JPY remains flat around 110.50 with around 1.3bln in option expiries around 110.00-40.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>More decent block buying in the belly of the US Treasury curve is representative if not catalytic in terms of a broad and firm rebound in debt futures that has seen Bunds forge a new Eurex intraday high at 165.80, +36 ticks vs -20 ticks in wake of Lui He low, while Gilts have pushed on further with the initial catch-up baton to hit 127.36. Further ahead, traders are now eyeing upcoming comments from BoE’s Cunliffe ahead of Fed’s Kaplan and Quarles later in the day; with US JOLTS and USD 38bln in supply also on the docket.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (-0.6%) and WTI (-0.4%) prices are somewhat subdued, but have been relatively steady and are currently trading within a very narrow USD 1/bbl range this morning. News flow for the complex has been relatively light, with prices largely moving in-line with the US-China driven sentiment. However, there were reports that Israel has provided the White House with intelligence regarding a potential Iranian plot to target US interest in the Gulf. Looking ahead, we have the API weekly inventory report with expectations for crude inventories to increase by 2.5mln barrels; additionally, the EIA are releasing their Short Term Energy Outlook, where they previously forecast that the US crude oil production is to average 12.4mln BPD in 2019 and 13.1mln BOD in 2020. For reference, EIA weekly crude production stood at 12.3mln BPD in last week’s release.</p><p>Gold (U/C) prices are largely unchanged on the day, with the safe haven selling off slightly following China stating that Vice Premier Liu He is to attend trade talks in the US. With the yellow metal still holding firm above the USD 1280/oz level, currently around USD 1281/oz. Elsewhere, Vale state that the Brucutu mining complex has stopped operations due to a court decision; follows on from a prior lower court decision which had stated that mining activities could resume.</p><p>LME are in talks with Chinese authorities to open its first metal warehouse in the country.

The FTSE 100 (-0.2%) is mildly lagging its peers as UK markets return from a bank holiday, and as such are reacting to the US-China trade updates; although, downside in the index is limited by the likes of Vodafone (+1.4%) and AstraZeneca (+1.5%) in the green after making a deal with Telefonica Deutschland (+2.2%) and announcing that their Phase 3 Calquence study achieved its primary endpoints respectively. Sectors are similarly mixed with energy names down in tandem with the oil complex, and notably the auto sector is once again in the red dragged down by heavyweight BMW (-1.0%) post-earnings. Following the Co. posted Q1 EBIT significantly lower than the prior levels and that the Co. have set aside EUR 1.4bln for anti-trust provisions after the Co. were previously warned of a significant charge resulting from an EU probe into collusion over delaying the implementation of cleaner-emissions cars. Other notable movers this morning include, AB Inbev (-0.1%) who at first fell around 1% at the open due to a slight miss on Q1 revenues and stating that short term dividend growth will be impacted deleveraging commitments. However, Co’s shares subsequently retraced much of this downside after stating that they are considering the IPO of their Asia-Pacific unit in Hong Kong, which could reportedly value the business at up to USD 40-70bln. In contrast, Infineon (-0.3%) initially moved higher by around 1.3% but gave up much of this surge as the Co. initially posted a beat on Q2 revenues but did emphasise that the market environment remains competitive.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - Aud/Usd is firmly back above 0.7000, albeit off overnight recovery highs circa 0.7050, while Aud/Nzd remains nearer the top of its range (1.0640+) having reclaimed 1.0600 status from a low of 1.0575 ahead of the eagerly awaited RBA policy meeting. In sum, the OCR was maintained at 1.5% and the accompanying statement struck a less dovish tone than most were anticipating as rate expectations were finely balanced between 51% for on hold and the remainder predicting a 25 bp ease. However, the Bank reiterated that strength in the labour market outweighed weakness in wages and inflation, supporting the decision to stand pat again and monitor data/economic developments (domestic and external). Conversely, Nzd/Usd has drifted back down towards 0.6600 as the spotlight switches to the RBNZ amidst even greater expectations that an ease is in the offing – see the Ransquawk headline feed for a more detailed preview.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong> - The next best performing G10 currencies as the Swedish Krona rebounds from recent lows vs the Euro through 10.7000 on a broad stabilisation in risk sentiment and despite Riksbank minutes reaffirming the more dovish shift at the last policy meeting. Similarly, the Nok has pared losses to trade back above 9.7500 against the Eur and the backdrop of steadier oil prices.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Cnh is consolidating off Monday’s lows around 6.7750 vs 6.8000+ in wake of reports that China’s Vice Premier Lui will attend the next round of trade talks in Washington and the perception if not reality that his presence improves the chances that an agreement will be reached in time to avoid the 25% tariffs on a further Usd200 bn goods threatened by US President Trump over the weekend. However, this has not done much to lift the gloom for the Try as the Istanbul rerun is not due until June 23 and as such the uncertain domestic political scene will remain for another 1 1/2 months at least. The Lira has consolidated off a 6.2000 base vs the Dollar, but Turkish assets are still underperforming and looking vulnerable.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/JPY/CAD</strong> - All relatively flat vs. the buck as news-flow somewhat slowed in EU trade, albeit Brexit remains in the background with Labour leader Corbyn not partaking to today’s cross-party talks, whilst PM May is speculated to receive her departure date before the 1922 committee. Sky News’ Rigby did however note that prospects have increased for a cross-party deal, citing a Cabinet source. Cable largely was unreactive to a technical speech by Cunliffe on post-Brexit financial stability. GBP/USD remains below the 1.3100 handle (having fallen below its 50 DMA around the figure), with the next technical at its 100 HMA at 1.3077. Elsewhere, the single currency remains just around the 1.1200 level, with the European Commission Spring Forecast pushed back to around 11:30BST due to an earlier speech by the Commission’s President. The focus of the release will be Italy as press reported that the EC may warn of widening Italian budget deficit to 2.6% of GDP, above the government’s forecast of 2.4%. Moving on, the Loonie straddles just below 1.3500 vs. the Greenback ahead of Ivey PMIs later. Elsewhere, JPY remains sub-111 vs. the Buck, holding onto most of its post-Trump risk premia ahead of further trade talks this week with Vice Premier Liu He now attending, signalling high-level talks. USD/JPY remains flat around 110.50 with around 1.3bln in option expiries around 110.00-40.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>More decent block buying in the belly of the US Treasury curve is representative if not catalytic in terms of a broad and firm rebound in debt futures that has seen <strong>Bunds</strong> forge a new Eurex intraday high at 165.80, +36 ticks vs -20 ticks in wake of Lui He low, while <strong>Gilts</strong> have pushed on further with the initial catch-up baton to hit 127.36. Further ahead, traders are now eyeing upcoming comments from BoE’s Cunliffe ahead of Fed’s Kaplan and Quarles later in the day; with US JOLTS and USD 38bln in supply also on the docket.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Brent (-0.4%) and WTI (-0.3%) prices are somewhat subdued,</strong> but have been relatively steady and are currently trading within a very narrow USD 1/bbl range this morning. News flow for the complex has been relatively light, with prices largely moving in-line with the US-China driven sentiment. However, there were reports that Israel has provided the White House with intelligence regarding a potential Iranian plot to target US interest in the Gulf. Looking ahead, we have the API weekly inventory report with expectations for crude inventories to increase by 2.5mln barrels; additionally, the EIA are releasing their Short Term Energy Outlook, where they previously forecast that the US crude oil production is to average 12.4mln BPD in 2019 and 13.1mln BOD in 2020. For reference, EIA weekly crude production stood at 12.3mln BPD in last week’s release.</p><p>Gold (U/C) prices are largely unchanged on the day, with the safe haven selling off slightly following China stating that Vice Premier Liu He is to attend trade talks in the US. With the yellow metal still holding firm above the USD 1280/oz level, currently around USD 1281/oz. Elsewhere, Vale state that the Brucutu mining complex has stopped operations due to a court decision; follows on from a prior lower court decision which had stated that mining activities could resume.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia traded mixed as sentiment remained at the whim of the ongoing US-China trade uncertainty with Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) and KOSPI (-0.9%) the underperformers on return from holiday closures as they got their first opportunity to react to US President Trump’s tariff threat. Nonetheless, there was no lack of success stories in Japan with Sony among the biggest gainers after having waited through a 10-day closure to finally benefit from a return to profit in Q4 and with SoftBank boosted as it considers an IPO for its USD 100bln Vision Fund. Elsewhere, ASX 200 (+0.3%) was positive with the index led by strength in mining names and after mostly encouraging Trade Balance and Retail Sales data, while some participants were also hopeful for a rate cut by the RBA although this failed to materialize and subsequently saw the index give back some of the gains. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) nursed some of the prior day’s sell-off in which the mainland bourse had dropped nearly 6% due to the heightened trade tensions. Furthermore, the recovery also followed a substantial rebound on Wall St after reports that the China delegation will still travel to Washington D.C. provided a glimmer of hope, although this was later clouded after-hours as US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer confirmed a deterioration in negotiations and that tariffs will be increased if there is no agreement by Friday. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as the risk-averse tone in Tokyo spurred demand government bonds and with the BoJ also present in the market for JPY 940bln of JGBs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as sentiment remains at the whim of the ongoing US-China trade uncertainty with Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) and KOSPI (-0.9%) the underperformers on return from holiday closures as they get their first opportunity to react to US President Trump’s tariff threat. Nonetheless, there is also no lack of success stories in Japan with Sony the biggest gainer after having waited through a 10-day closure to finally benefit from a return to profit in Q4 and with SoftBank boosted as it reportedly considers an IPO for its USD 100bln Vision Fund. Elsewhere, ASX 200 (+0.9%) is positive with the index led by strength in mining names and after mostly encouraging Trade Balance and Retail Sales data, with some participants also hopeful for a rate cut by the RBA later. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) are also in the green as they nurse some of the prior day’s sell-off in which the mainland bourse had dropped nearly 6% due to the heightened trade tensions. Furthermore, the recovery also follows a substantial rebound on Wall St after reports that the China delegation will still travel to Washington D.C. provided a glimmer of hope, although this was later clouded after-hours as US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Trade Representative Lighthizer confirmed a deterioration in negotiations and that tariffs will be increased if there is no agreement by Friday.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer and trades just below 97.50 amid mild gains in its major counterparts in which EUR/USD reclaimed the 1.1200 handle and with GBP/USD back above 1.3100. However, upside is capped as participants look ahead to the resumption of business in Westminster following the long weekend, with PM May facing fresh calls to resign from within her party and is also said to have been warned that MPs will attempt to oust her as early as this week if she agrees to Labour proposals for a customs union deal with the EU. AUD/USD is slightly firmer amid gains in iron ore prices and following mostly encouraging data from Australia but with price moves restricted in anticipation of the RBA rate decision, which is seen as a very close call as markets price in a 51% probability for rates to be kept on hold vs. 49% chances of a 25bps cut, while 3 of the big 4 banks in Australia are calling for no change in rates. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is rangebound below 111.00 as the risk averse tone in Japan acts as a restraint, while TRY suffered heavily to print its weakest since October due to political concerns after Turkey’s High Election Board ruled to re-run the Istanbul local elections which the opposition party had won.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as the risk-averse tone in Tokyo spurs safe-haven demand and with BoJ also present in the market for JPY 940bln of JGBs.</p>",
