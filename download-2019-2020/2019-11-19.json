Events: FOMC Minutes, Business Council of Australia Annual Diner. Speakers: ECB’s Lane, Makhlouf, Riksbank Governor Ingves. Supply: Australia, Germany. Earnings: L Brands, Lowe’s, Target.</li></ul><p><strong>*MARKETS WRAP: </strong>Stocks were mixed on Tuesday, where little material macro updates failed to provide a meaning move in most major assets, XAU and DX were flat, with Treasuries inching higher, albeit the 2s10s did fall beneath 20bps. The DJIA was the underperforming US index with gratitude to a disappointing HD quarter and guidance, in addition to BA losses on safety concerns of 737 NGs. The retail sector in general was a weight on indices, where KSS earnings echoed HD's, in that it guided lower, with KSS closing lower by ~20%; in fact, KSS, M, JWN and HD were the four worst performers on S&amp;P 500, where M was also hit from a data breach. The NDQ's under-exposure to consumer names led to its modest outperformance. On the US-China trade front, the main takeaway from the session was sources suggesting there is debate between the two sides on how much tariffs to roll back, but the fact there was mention of tariff roll backs provided some relief. The crude complex sold off relatively strongly through the session, with limited risk appetite and some bearish supply news flow taking its toll on the energy complex. All-in-all, quite a session, with the VIX remaining subdued; participants now look towards the week's known remaining risk events, namely Wednesday's FOMC minutes (although they are likely to be a non-event given latest Fed commentary) and PMIs on Friday, note that there still has been no official decision on EU auto tariffs from the US, but they are widely expected to be delayed, sooner or later.</p><p><strong>* CHINA:</strong> The near-deal between the US and China that fell apart six months ago in May is now reportedly being used as the benchmark for the sides to decide how much tariffs should be rolled back in the initial phase one trade agreement, according to sources. Analysts said that the news was positive since it indicates negotiators are discussing methods to roll-back tariffs, which could potentially mean that the levies due to go into effect mid-December might also be cancelled. The story, however, did note that there was now wide scepticism on both sides that a more comprehensive phase two agreement (which would include provisions on structural reforms and enforcement) can ever be reached. Meanwhile, US President Trump said China has got to make a trade deal, and he reiterated that if both sides cannot strike a deal, he would raise tariffs.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed’s Williams (Voter) said the US economy is in a very good place, is close to achieving the 2% inflation goal on a sustained basis; this year’s interest rate cuts have been very effective and currently monetary policy is well positioned, the Fed will stick to data dependency. Fed's Williams added that his key focus in assessing stresses in the repo market in September is monetary policy, where the Fed will be thinking why the level of reserves needs to be so high, including looking at regulations. The NY Fed President said that over the coming months, the Fed must ensure it is not overreactive to individual data points, if inflation were to move in the wrong direction on a sustained basis, the Fed could become more accommodative. Williams said that because reserve levels are higher than the Fed was anticipating, it does not change monetary policy calculus, where the focus on repo stresses is what is making banks want to hold such reserve levels.</p><p><strong>*FOMC MINUTES PREVIEW</strong>: At the end-October confab, the Fed concluded its ‘mid-cycle adjustment’, re-adopting a data-dependent approach. Participants will, therefore, be assessing what conditions the Fed might need to see to tweak its bias. There is a risk the minutes will be stale, revealing little new information, given the heavy slate of recent Fedspeak. Elsewhere, traders will eye updates on the balance sheet, and potentially discussion of details regarding a Standing Repo Facility (SRF). Minutes will be published on 20th November 2019 at 1900 GMT/1400 ET. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23278/download\">Click here for full analysis.</a></p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.1% at 3120, NASDAQ-100 0.1% at 8339, Dow Jones -0.4% at 27934</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -1%, Consumer Staples -0.3%, Energy -1.5%, Financials 0.2%, Health Care 0.7%, Industrials -0.1%, Information Technology 0.2%, Materials -0.3%, Telecommunication Services -0.3%, Utilities -0.3%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Retailers took a hit with Home Depot (HD) reporting a miss on revenue and SSS whilst lowering its guidance. Meanwhile, Kohl’s (KSS) dived lower as it missed on EPS and disappointed on guidance.

Medicines Company (MDCO) also surged following “multiple” potential bidders, including Novartis (NOVN SW, NVS).</p><p><strong>* US OCTOBER HOUSING STARTS/BUILDING PERMITS: </strong>Starts rose to 1.314mln, slightly missing the consensus view, while permits rose to 1.461mln, rising above the consensus view, to the highest since May 2007. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that both single- and multi-family starts rose, with the former tracking permits with a usually one-month lag, and Pantheon looks for further increases in the November data. Permits, meanwhile, were boosted by a rise in the multi-family component. \"This too might just be noise, but the trend appears to be rising too; the 12-month average has climbed to a 32-year high, likely in response to the rock-bottom vacancy rate for rental property,\" Pantheon says, \"the lag between permit and completion in multi-family housing is quite long, about 15-months, and the trend in permits has only been rising for only a few months, so the vacancy rate will remain under pressure for another year at least.\"</p><p><strong>* PERSIAN GULF:</strong> The US aircraft carrier strike group, Abraham Lincoln, was transited through the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday; since tensions spiked with Iran in recent months, that was something officials had been considering and they said a passage would send a strong message to Iran, where recent sanction induced fuel price rises have sparked civil unrest. US President Trump later said the first additional troops had arrived in Saudi Arabia, with more arriving in coming weeks. Russia's Foreign Ministry said the US decision to remove sanction waivers for the Iranian Fordow nuclear plant violates US international commitments and that Moscow will continue to cooperate with Iran on Fordow reconfiguration.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN SEPTEMBER MANUFACTURING SALES: </strong>At -0.2% M/M, the decline was smaller than the expected -0.5% M/M, but analysts still note the data highlights weakness in the Canadian manufacturing sector. The headline 'beat' was on the back of higher prices offsetting a sharper hit to volumes, Canadian bank Scotiabank writes; sales volumes are lower in three of the last four months, and five out of the nine in 2019. Scotia observes that stockpiling appears to be slowing, which may drag on GDP, with the bank's own models tracking little/no growth. The weakness in inventories might also put downside risks to the BOC's already softened forecast for Q3/Q4, Scotia says. While the GM strike and refinery shutdowns have impacted the data, Scotia says the even excluding these factors, the weakness is clear, particularly in the orders pipeline.</p><p><strong>* BOC:</strong> BOC First Deputy Governor Wilkins said that the central bank there still policy room to manoeuvre on rates, and has other options, such as forward guidance and asset purchases to help weather any economic storms. However, the Canadian economy and financial system were judged to be in a good position to weather any potential global shocks. The dovish comments saw USDCAD weaken to 1.3265 from around 1.3235 before the text release of her remarks.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 1.79 LOWER AT 55.35/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 1.53 LOWER AT USD 60.91/BBL. </strong>Crude futures continued their trundle lower on Tuesday amid some paring back in risk appetite, some ante-production cut commentary out of Russia and bearish supply updates in Europe. OPEC+ heavyweight Russia is reportedly unlikely to agree for further output cuts at the OPEC+ December 5th/6th meeting whilst suggesting that the cartel is concerned over weak demand growth in 2020, nonetheless, Russian producers are looking to increase 2020 output to support the state budget, sources said. These comments are unsurprising given Russia has previously show reluctance to further cuts and that OPEC commentary has echoed that further cuts are unlikely, with many signatories not fulfilling the existing pact. Elsewhere providing tailwinds, a Reuters calculation indicating that refinery margins in Northwest Europe are negative and the worst they have been in more than six years. Norwegian oil production rose to 1.519mln BPD in October (prev. 1.312mln BPD in September), according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Keystone pipeline operator TC Energy said there is no timeline on restoring the pipeline to full operation following the spill in North Dakota; it was reported last week that it had cut its November operations by 39% on the 590k BPD line affected. Nigeria's Aiteo group confirmed the shutdown of the 150k BPD Nembe Creek pipeline due to sabotage. Meanwhile, looking ahead to the US energy inventory reports, with the API on Tuesday evening and the official EIA release on Wednesday, current expectations see crude stocks building 1.5mln bbls, gasoline building 0.9mln bbls and distillates drawing 0.7mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 3+ TICKS AT 129.14. </strong>The T-Note moved modestly higher throughout the European and US session where the curve continued to flatten on Tuesday without a material market update, the 2s30s narrowed by over 4bps, whilst the 2s10s narrowed by approximately 2.5bps, bringing the 2s10s back below 20bps.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION DEBATE:</strong> As this briefing goes to clients, UK PM Johnson and Labour’s opposition leader Corbyn just concluded the first election debate. For traders, there was little that added to the Brexit narrative, and GBP was directionless throughout the debate. After market, attention will be on a YouGov poll on the performance of the candidates at the debate. Ahead of the debate, a YouGov poll saw the tory lead over Labour narrow to 12 points from 17 points reported in the weekend poll.</p><p><strong>* RBA MINUTES: </strong>Minutes from the RBA’s<strong> </strong>November meeting revealed that the board is prepared to ease policy further, if needed, and agreed a case could be made for a rate cut at the meeting, but ultimately decided that rates should be held steady for now. The board recognized negative effects of lower rates on savers and confidence, as rate cuts could have a different impact on confidence than in the past, while it saw a case to wait and assess the impact of its prior substantial stimulus, with policymakers agreeing that an extended period of low rates is needed to achieve targets. The minutes also discussed the revised forecasts but highlighted that the central bank remains uncertain about the pace of recovery. Westpac’s analysts said that the minutes seemed to play down the notion that December was a ‘live’ meeting, although the meeting occurred ahead of the weak labour market data. “We certainly do not believe that those prints will be sufficient to move the RBA away from its current monitoring approach,” the bank writes, and therefore, it maintains its call for a February 2020 rate cut. (NOTE: after the minutes, money market pricing for a December cut was little changed at around 30%).</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> headed into the overnight session relatively flat after a day of trading in tight ranges with the DXY seeing lows at 97.745 and highs at 97.888. <strong>CNH</strong> also relatively flat against the buck ahead of the PBoC Loan Prime Rate decision. <strong>GBP</strong> retraced most of its Monday gains as participants awaited the UK General Election debate between UK PM Johnson and Labour Leader Corbyn. The debate provided little new information, although eyes will be on the You Gov poll expected to come out just after the closing bell to see how the public viewed the debate. EURUSD traded in a 20-pip range as it tested its 21dma multiple times at 1.1082, which coincided with the highs on the cross. <strong>Havens</strong> were mixed with JPY marginally firmer against the buck, although gains were limited on reports that US and China are said to tie the tariff relief to the May deal to decide how much tariffs should be rolled back. The haven outflow move was limited as USDJPY pared the majority of those gains throughout the rest of the session as Trump reiterated if there is no deal he will increase tariffs. USDJPY trades around the 108.50 handle at pixel time. XAU was also slightly bid, trading in a 10-buck range between USD 1465-1475, CHF however was weaker against the greenback and Euro, and relatively flat against GBP. <strong>Antipodes</strong> trade firmer despite initial AUD weakness following a dovish RBA minutes, with reports noting Australian PM set to announce a USD 3.8bln infrastructure stimulus package tomorrow, which will likely take some pressure of the RBA for further stimulus. Also, of note, RBA Watcher McCranns’ December view is for the Central Bank to leave rates unchanged, whilst the minutes providing little change to current market pricing. NZD largely traded in tandem with AUD, albeit ended the day firmer against its antipodean counterpart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>Crude futures continued their trundle lower on Tuesday amid some paring back in risk appetite, some ante-production cut commentary out of Russia and bearish supply updates in Europe. OPEC+ heavyweight Russia is reportedly unlikely to agree for further output cuts at the OPEC+ December 5th/6th meeting whilst suggesting that the cartel is concerned over weak demand growth in 2020, nonetheless, Russian producers are looking to increase 2020 output to support the state budget, sources said. These comments are unsurprising given Russia has previously show reluctance to further cuts and that OPEC commentary has echoed that further cuts are unlikely, with many signatories not fulfilling the existing pact. Elsewhere providing tailwinds, a Reuters calculation indicating that refinery margins in Northwest Europe are negative and the worst they have been in more than six years. Norwegian oil production rose to 1.519mln BPD in October (prev. 1.312mln BPD in September), according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Keystone pipeline operator TC Energy said there is no timeline on restoring the pipeline to full operation following the spill in North Dakota; it was reported last week that it had cut its November operations by 39% on the 590k BPD line affected. Nigeria's Aiteo group confirmed the shutdown of the 150k BPD Nembe Creek pipeline due to sabotage. Meanwhile, looking ahead to the US energy inventory reports, with the API on Tuesday evening and the official EIA release on Wednesday, current expectations see crude stocks building 1.5mln bbls, gasoline building 0.9mln bbls and distillates drawing 0.7mln bbls.</li></ul>",

The debate will be between UK PM Johnson and Opposition Leader Corbyn, after the SNP and Liberal Democrats lost the bid to have their leaders feature. After the debate concludes, at 22:00GMT ITV will be hosting an ‘election interviews’ special, which will feature interviews from Liberal Democrats leader Swinson, Brexit Party’s Farage and SNP’s Sturgeon amongst others.</li><li>Note, after the ITV 20:00GMT debate finishes YouGov are expected to publish a poll at 21:00GMT; it is not currently clear as to whether this will be published via ITV or YouGov themselves or if the poll will be a reaction to the debate or the more typical voting intention style one. For reference, the most recent poll via YouGov was conducted for the Sunday Times on the 14th-15th November: Conservatives 45% (+3), Labour 28% (U/C), Liberal Democrats 15% (U/C), &amp; Brexit Party 4% (U/C).</li></ul><p><strong>Expectations</strong></p><ul><li>The debate is the first meeting of the election campaign between PM Johnson and Opposition Leader Corbyn and as such will come under significant focus for the UK election/Brexit watchers.</li><li>Going into the debate, UK political journalists are noting that while these events have the potential to change the narrative for elections given how well-prepared leaders are prior to this, such a move tends to be the exception rather than the norm; with the Guardian noting the most likely outcome is a ‘score draw’. BBC’s Smith notes that the layout of the evening (half on Brexit and half on everything else) plays to Johnsons strengths. Given that the PM has secured a Brexit deal with the EU Johnson will feel as if he has the upper hand on these issues vs. Corbyn; particularly as his driving line for the election is the party that will get Brexit done.</li></ul><p><strong>Market Outcome</strong></p><ul><li>The event, if it is a draw, may not have a significant impact on Sterling; however, ING do note that a Johnson victory would be Sterling positive though they do caveat that 0.8500 in EUR/GBP is likely to function as support for the cross, and therefore may limit Sterling’s upside somewhat.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>A more upbeat day for the broad Dollar and Index as it looks to notch its first session of gains in the last five days. Again, news-flow was on the lighter side but the DXY managed to hold onto a bulk of its early-European gains having found an overnight base at 97.75. The Index is poised to end the session closer to its upper intraday bound of 97.88 ahead tomorrow’s FOMC minutes which is not expected to give much by way of new info and has been made somewhat redundant by the latest Fed speak. Meanwhile, USD/CNH is set to end EU trade firmer and close to session highs having traded within a 7.0230-7.0320 ahead of the anticipated PBoC Loan Prime Rate cut tonight with the next level to the upside its 100 DMA at 7.0400.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Antipodeans are poised to end the session on the front foot after initial downside seen from the originally dovish-perceived RBA minutes subsided. The currencies may possibly be buoyed by reports that the Australian PM is set to announce a USD 3.8bln infrastructure stimulus package tomorrow, which is to be fast-tracked over the next four years, stating that it will support in the economy by creating jobs in the near term. The move is likely to take some pressure off the RBA for more stimulus, especially given last week’s downbeat labour market figures. The minutes from last night added little to the overall narrative, it noted that a case could be made for a cut at the November meeting and reiterated that the Board is prepared to ease further if needed. House views, including RBA Watcher McCranns’, on the next move were unchanged while money market pricing was little swayed. AUD/USD trades near the top of today’s 0.6786-6832 parameter (after initially feeling pressure from the minutes) as it eyes its 100 DMA to the upside at 0.6837 having surpassed its 50 DMA at 0.6815. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart looks to close the EU day with a 0.6400+ status having fluctuated in a 0.6383-6430 intraday range.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Both little changed and on standby for the UK general election debate with the Tory and Labour leaders at 2000GMT ahead of the latest YouGov polling at 2100GMT which will be observed to confirm the uptrend in the Tory lead over Labour. Pertinent news-flow has remained light throughout the session whilst Cable and EUR/USD maintained a relatively tight intraday range of 1.2927-69 and 1.1060-80 respectively with the latter having failed an upside breach of its 21 DMA at 1.1082.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF, XAU</strong></p><p>Safe havens are set to end the European day mostly on the backfoot, albeit lesser-so the Yen with little by way of new substance regarding US-Sino talks to capitalise on. USD/JPY remains little changed after trading within a 108.47-84 range with the next level to upside its 200 DMA at 108.98 ahead of the round figure.&nbsp; Conversely, the Franc saw more pronounced downside as US markets came online but more likely on a few technical factors at play after EUR/CHF topped its 50 and 100 DMAs earlier (at 1.0955 and 1.0960) but failed to conclusively take out its 61.8% Fib (from the 1.1058-1.0864 move) at 1.0983 and its 21 DMA at 1.0985. Finally, spot gold remains within a USD 10/oz range having found a base and orders at 1465/oz earlier in the session with sights still locked on trade headlines ahead of FOMC minutes tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+1.5%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%)</strong> began indecisively but gradually improved as reports of Beijing trade pessimism was offset by a 90-day license extension for US firms to continue doing business with Huawei, while the PBoC also continued its liquidity efforts with another firm injection of CNY 120bln through 7-Day Reverse Repos. Finally, 10yr JGBs were mildly higher as they tracked recent upside in T-notes and amid weakness in Japanese stocks, while demand was also supported by the BoJ’s presence in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 120bln via 7-day reverse repos for a daily net injection of CNY 120bln. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 7.0030 vs. Exp. 7.0061 (Prev. 7.0037)</strong></p><p>About 100 protesters were still barricaded in Polytechnic University in Hong Kong as the stand-off with police continued, while there were also comments from Hong Kong Chief Executive Lam that she hopes the campus standoff can be solved peacefully and she told police to handle protesters leaving the campus in a humane way. China's Hong Kong Affairs Office expressed strong concern over Hong Kong Court decision to overturn mask ban and China’s Parliament Law Committee said Hong Kong Courts have no power to rule on constitutionality of the face mask ban law.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.7%)</strong> are on the front foot in another day of quiet trade, following on from a broadly positive APAC handover. A decent liquidity injection from the PBoC, a lack of fresh negative US/China trade negatives (the 90-day Huawei waiver appears to have mostly offset negativity regarding reported pessimism on deal in China), plus a lack of looming risk events appear to be enabling the recent trend in global equities to continue, i.e. a persistent grind higher. Also, possibly acting in support are reports that US President Trump’s Section 232 auto tariff authority (which he could have used to put tariffs on European auto imports) has run out of time, meaning he may have to find other means if he wants to pursue auto tariffs on Europe/Japan, legal experts said. As a reminder, Trump last Thursday took no action to impose or delay national security tariffs on auto imports, despite a deadline to do so by that date. Regardless, US index futures made YTD highs again this morning, with the ES Dec’19 contract reaching highs of 3129, while back in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 broke out of last week’s range to make new highs around 3720, with ATHs seemingly now within reach at 3769. In terms of the sectors, things are mostly in the green, with underperformance being seen in the more defensive Utilities (-0.1%), Consumer Stapes (+0.1%) and Health Care (+0.3%) sectors, while Telecoms (unch.) have also been on the back foot, with the news that France’s 5G auction has been delayed until March 2020 doing little to help. Risk sensitive sectors, including Consumer Discretionary (+1.1%) and Financials (+1.1%) are amongst the outperformers. In terms of the standout movers; Halma (+12.0%) tops the Stoxx 600 performance chart, where the Co. posted decent gains in pre-tax profit and increased its interim dividend. Propping up the Stoxx 600 table is SES (-19.4%), after the US FCC chairman voiced support for a public auction to free up space for 5G – SES had been lobbying for a private auction. EasyJet (+3.6%) is higher after the Co. posted earnings which beat on top and bottom line expectations and said bookings are “slightly ahead” of last year. Looking at flow data from EPFR, they show that European equities received inflows averaging USD 9.6bln for a third straight, compared to an average USD 5bln weekly outflow since December last year. Morgan Stanley cited the return of flows as part of the reason why they are overweight European equities, adding that the region has room for a further price-to-earnings re-rating, citing reduced Brexit risk, possible shift from monetary to fiscal stimulus, and tighter peripheral and credit spreads as other catalysts.</p><p><strong>Boeing (BA) </strong>– Unidentified airline signed order for 10 Boeing 737Max 7s and 10 Max 10s, according to sources; additionally, Air Astana announced intent to buy 30 737 Max aircrafts.

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY, CNH - </strong>The broad Dollar and Index have rebounded off APAC lows after the latter found a base at the 97.75 mark. DXY resides near the top end of today’s 97.75-88 parameter ahead of another quiet session in terms of scheduled events and with sights still locked on US-Sino trade developments. Meanwhile, USD/CNH trades little changed on the day having earlier tested its 21 DMA to the upside at 7.0320 (vs. intraday low of 7.0230) ahead of its 100 DMA at 7.0415</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR - </strong>Both intially moved sideways and within tight ranges against the Buck amid a lack of fresh catalysts and with eyes on the tonight’s Johnson/Corbyn showdown debate commencing at 2000GMT and the latest YouGov polling at 2100GMT. Upside in Sterling remains somewhat capped in light of comments from EU Trade Chief Weyand who warned of a “bare bones” or no trade deal from Brussels next year, however traders need to steer through domestic political landscape first with election day drawing closer. GBP/USD remains drifted from the 1.2950 mark to around 1.2925, whilst the upside includes reported barriers at 1.3000 and reported stops at 1.3030. EUR/USD resides just north of 1.1050 having earlier tested its 21 DMA at 1.1081 and with eyes on its 100 DMA at 1.1091.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD - </strong>The antipodeans are flat in early European trade with AUD/USD and NZD/USD around 0.6800 and 0.6400 respectively, but off overnight lows. The pairs were initially pressured (albeit modestly) upon the release of the RBA minutes which noted that a case could be made for a cut at the November meeting and reiterated that the Board is prepared to ease further if needed. However, analysts at Westpac believe that the case for a December cut is heavily downplayed in the minutes and the dismal Aussie labour force figures from last week may not be sufficient enough for a move from its current “monitoring” approach, and thus Westpac maintains its forecast for a 25bps February cut. AUD/USD rebounded from its overnight post-RBA base of 0.6785 back above 0.6800 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6814. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart reclaimed 0.6400+ status from an APAC low of 0.6383 (21 DMA) with the next level to the upside its 50 DMA at 0.6435.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF - </strong>Little action on the safe-heaven front thus far although prices seem to have a downside bias against the USD, potentially on the latter’s recovery from its APAC trough. Participants will again be eyeing developments on the US-Sino trade front amid mixed/contrasting recent reports. Meanwhile, the situation in Hong Kong seems to feel some reprieve (for now at least) after the number of protesters trapped inside the Polytechnic University fell from around 700 to between 100-200, however sources cite by the SCMP noted of over 8000 petrol bombs at the Chinese University ready for use. USD/JPY tested and resides around 108.75 (21 DMA) ahead of potential resistance at 108.83 (Tenkan line) with a barrage of options expiring with USD 1bln between 108.50-55 and a further USD 1bln between 108.90-109.00. The Franc also awaits further risk-driven action as USD/CHF meanders around 0.9900 in early EU trade and eyes its 21 DMA at 0.9911.</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes</strong> from November meeting stated the board is prepared to ease further if needed and agreed a case could be made for a rate cut at the meeting but decided rates should be held steady. RBA board recognized negative effects of lower rates on savers and confidence as rate cuts could have a different impact on confidence than in the past, while it saw a case to wait and assess impact of its prior substantial stimulus and agreed an extended period of low rates is needed to achieve targets. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>RBA watcher McCrann</strong> says he believes the RBA will not cut rates in December. (Newswires/Herald Sun)</p><p>Notable FX Option Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.1025 (600M), <strong>1.1050-55 (1.4BLN),</strong> 1.1100-05 (400M) 1.1135-45 (900M).</p><p>- EUR/CHF: <strong>1.1000 (855M)</strong></p><p>- USD/JPY: 107.95 (900M), <strong>108.30-35 (1.1BLN), 108.50-55 (1BLN) 108.90-109.00 (1BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Another relatively uneventful day for the debt complex thus far, with very little in the way of catalysts for price action this morning; a picture which doesn’t look set to change until Fed’s Williams at 14:00GMT and the first UK election head-to-head debate at 20:00GMT. Prior to this, <strong>gilts</strong> are essentially unchanged but do reside towards the top of the day’s slim sub 30-tick range; tonight’s debate will provide the first opportunity for voters to see Johnson and Corbyn face off, and as such may impact on some voting intentions if either leader has a particularly strong, or alternatively weak, performance. Technically speaking, either side of the sessions current range are support/resistance points at 131.32 and 131.93 respectively, which may come into play in the event the complex livens-up ahead of the debate. Separately, but on a similar note, <strong>Bunds and USTs</strong> are little moved overall and just a shade softer on the day at present given the lack of newsflow. Stateside specifically, the curve is very modestly bear-flattening ahead of the aforementioned Fed speak.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Crude markets are lower</strong>, with the complex trading heavy despite this morning’s rally in the equity market and a lack of fresh fundamental catalysts. <strong>WTI Dec’ 19 futures fell to lows of USD 56.48/bbl, while Brent Jan’ 19 futures</strong> fell as low as USD 61.74/bbl, before losses were somewhat pared. In terms of crude specific news of note; Norwegian oil production stood at 1.519mln bpd in October (prelim) vs. Prev. 1.312mln BPD in September, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. As a reminder, this Thursday sees the release of the Norwegian oil investment survey, with Q3 oil and gas pipeline/extraction investment seen coming in at NOK 181bln, as estimated by the prior release. Elsewhere, and on the docket today, traders will be eyeing tonight’s API Inventory figure which last week printed a draw of 0.54mln barrels. Finally, <strong>gold</strong> prices slid back beneath the USD 1470/oz mark and copper has been moving higher, assisted by advancing equity prices with eyes remaining on US-China trade developments.</p><p>US total shale region production for December is expected to be +49k BPD to 9.133mln BPD, according to EIA.

A decent liquidity injection from the PBoC, a lack of fresh negative US/China trade negatives (the 90-day Huawei waiver appears to have mostly offset negativity regarding reported pessimism on deal in China), plus a lack of looming risk events appear to be enabling the recent trend in global equities to continue, i.e. a persistent grind higher. Also, possibly acting in support are reports that US President Trump’s Section 232 auto tariff authority (which he could have used to put tariffs on European auto imports) has run out of time, meaning he may have to find other means if he wants to pursue auto tariffs on Europe/Japan, legal experts said. As a reminder, Trump last Thursday took no action to impose or delay national security tariffs on auto imports, despite a deadline to do so by that date. Regardless, US index futures made YTD highs again this morning, with the ES Dec’19 contract reaching highs of 3129, while back in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 broke out of last week’s range to make new highs around 3720, with ATHs seemingly now within reach at 3769. In terms of the sectors, things are mostly in the green, with underperformance being seen in the more defensive Utilities (-0.1%), Consumer Stapes (+0.1%) and Health Care (+0.3%) sectors, while Telecoms (unch.) have also been on the back foot, with the news that France’s 5G auction has been delayed until March 2020 doing little to help. Risk sensitive sectors, including Consumer Discretionary (+1.1%) and Financials (+1.1%) are amongst the outperformers. In terms of the standout movers; Halma (+12.0%) tops the Stoxx 600 performance chart, where the Co. posted decent gains in pre-tax profit and increased its interim dividend. Propping up the Stoxx 600 table is SES (-19.4%), after the US FCC chairman voiced support for a public auction to free up space for 5G – SES had been lobbying for a private auction. EasyJet (+3.6%) is higher after the Co. posted earnings which beat on top and bottom line expectations and said bookings are “slightly ahead” of last year. Looking at flow data from EPFR, they show that European equities received inflows averaging USD 9.6bln for a third straight, compared to an average USD 5bln weekly outflow since December last year. Morgan Stanley cited the return of flows as part of the reason why they are overweight European equities, adding that the region has room for a further price-to-earnings re-rating, citing reduced Brexit risk, possible shift from monetary to fiscal stimulus, and tighter peripheral and credit spreads as other catalysts.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>DXY, CNH - The broad Dollar and Index have rebounded off APAC lows after the latter found a base at the 97.75 mark. DXY resides near the top end of today’s 97.75-88 parameter ahead of another quiet session in terms of scheduled events and with sights still locked on US-Sino trade developments. Meanwhile, USD/CNH trades little changed on the day having earlier tested its 21 DMA to the upside at 7.0320 (vs. intraday low of 7.0230) ahead of its 100 DMA at 7.0415</p><p>GBP, EUR - Both initially moved sideways and within tight ranges against the Buck amid a lack of fresh catalysts and with eyes on the tonight’s Johnson/Corbyn showdown debate commencing at 2000GMT and the latest YouGov polling at 2100GMT. Upside in Sterling remains somewhat capped in light of comments from EU Trade Chief Weyand who warned of a “bare bones” or no trade deal from Brussels next year, however traders need to steer through domestic political landscape first with election day drawing closer. GBP/USD drifted from the 1.2950 mark to around 1.2925 with little pertinent news flow, whilst the upside includes reported barriers at 1.3000 and reported stops at 1.3030. EUR/USD resides just north of 1.1050 having earlier tested its 21 DMA at 1.1081 and with eyes on its 100 DMA at 1.1091.</p><p>AUD, NZD - The antipodeans are flat in early European trade with AUD/USD and NZD/USD around 0.6800 and 0.6400 respectively, but off overnight lows. The pairs were initially pressured (albeit modestly) upon the release of the RBA minutes which noted that a case could be made for a cut at the November meeting and reiterated that the Board is prepared to ease further if needed. However, analysts at Westpac believe that the case for a December cut is heavily downplayed in the minutes and the dismal Aussie labour force figures from last week may not be sufficient enough for a move from its current “monitoring” approach, and thus Westpac maintains its forecast for a 25bps February cut. AUD/USD rebounded from its overnight post-RBA base of 0.6785 back above 0.6800 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6814. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart reclaimed 0.6400+ status from an APAC low of 0.6383 (21 DMA) with the next level to the upside its 50 DMA at 0.6435.</p><p>JPY, CHF - Little action on the safe-heaven front thus far although prices seem to have a downside bias against the USD, potentially on the latter’s recovery from its APAC trough. Participants will again be eyeing developments on the US-Sino trade front amid mixed/contrasting recent reports. Meanwhile, the situation in Hong Kong seems to feel some reprieve (for now at least) after the number of protesters trapped inside the Polytechnic University fell from around 700 to between 100-200, however sources cite by the SCMP noted of over 8000 petrol bombs at the Chinese University ready for use. USD/JPY tested and resides around 108.75 (21 DMA) ahead of potential resistance at 108.83 (Tenkan line) with a barrage of options expiring with USD 1bln between 108.50-55 and a further USD 1bln between 108.90-109.00. The Franc also awaits further risk-driven action as USD/CHF meanders around 0.9900 in early EU trade and eyes its 21 DMA at 0.9911.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Another relatively uneventful day for the debt complex thus far, with very little in the way of catalysts for price action this morning; a picture which doesn’t look set to change until Fed’s Williams at 14:00GMT and the first UK election head-to-head debate at 20:00GMT. Prior to this, gilts are essentially unchanged but do reside towards the top of the day’s slim sub 30-tick range; tonight’s debate will provide the first opportunity for voters to see Johnson and Corbyn face off, and as such may impact on some voting intentions if either leader has a particularly strong, or alternatively weak, performance. Technically speaking, either side of the sessions current range are support/resistance points at 131.32 and 131.93 respectively, which may come into play in the event the complex livens-up ahead of the debate. Separately, but on a similar note, Bunds and USTs are little moved overall and just a shade softer on the day at present given the lack of newsflow. Stateside specifically, the curve is very modestly bear-flattening ahead of the aforementioned Fed speak.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude markets are lower, with the complex trading heavy despite this morning’s rally in the equity market and a lack of fresh fundamental catalysts. WTI Dec’ 19 futures fell to lows of USD 56.48/bbl, while Brent Jan’ 19 futures fell as low as USD 61.74/bbl, before losses were somewhat pared. In terms of crude specific news of note; Norwegian oil production stood at 1.519mln bpd in October (prelim) vs. Prev. 1.312mln BPD in September, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. As a reminder, this Thursday sees the release of the Norwegian oil investment survey, with Q3 oil and gas pipeline/extraction investment seen coming in at NOK 181bln, as estimated by the prior release. Elsewhere, and on the docket today, traders will be eyeing tonight’s API Inventory figure which last week printed a draw of 0.54mln barrels. Finally, gold prices slid back beneath the USD 1470/oz mark and copper has been moving higher, assisted by advancing equity prices with eyes remaining on US-China trade developments.</p>",

Prior to this, gilts are essentially unchanged but do reside towards the top of the day’s slim sub 30-tick range; tonight’s debate will provide the first opportunity for voters to see Johnson and Corbyn face off, and as such may impact on some voting intentions if either leader has a particularly strong, or alternatively weak, performance. Technically speaking, either side of the sessions current range are support/resistance points at 131.32 and 131.93 respectively, which may come into play in the event the complex livens-up ahead of the debate. Separately, but on a similar note, Bunds and USTs are little moved overall and just a shade softer on the day at present given the lack of newsflow. Stateside specifically, the curve is very modestly bear-flattening ahead of the aforementioned Fed speak.</p>",

DXY resides near the top end of today’s 97.75-88 parameter ahead of another quiet session in terms of scheduled events and with sights still locked on US-Sino trade developments. Meanwhile, USD/CNH trades little changed on the day having earlier tested its 21 DMA to the upside at 7.0320 (vs. intraday low of 7.0230) ahead of its 100 DMA at 7.0415</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Both moving sideways and within tight ranges against the Buck and in the cross amid a lack of fresh catalysts and with eyes on the tonight’s Johnson/Corbyn showdown debate commencing at 2000GMT and the latest YouGov polling at 2100GMT. Upside in Sterling remains somewhat capped in light of comments from EU Trade Chief Weyand who warned of a “bare bones” or no trade deal from Brussels next year, however traders need to steer through domestic political landscape first with election day drawing closer. GBP/USD remains pinned to the 1.2950 mark ahead of reported barriers at 1.3000 and reported stops at 1.3030. EUR/USD resides just north of 1.1050 having earlier tested its 21 DMA at 1.1081 and with eyes on its 100 DMA at 1.1091.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The antipodeans are flat in early European trade with AUD/USD and NZD/USD around 0.6800 and 0.6400 respectively, but off overnight lows. The pairs were initially pressured (albeit modestly) upon the release of the RBA minutes which noted that a case could be made for a cut at the November meeting and reiterated that the Board is prepared to ease further if needed. However, analysts at Westpac believe that the case for a December cut is heavily downplayed in the minutes and the dismal Aussie labour force figures from last week may not be sufficient enough for a move from its current “monitoring” approach, and thus Westpac maintains its forecast for a 25bps February cut. AUD/USD rebounded from its overnight post-RBA base of 0.6785 back above 0.6800 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6814. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart reclaimed 0.6400+ status from an APAC low of 0.6383 (21 DMA) with the next level to the upside its 50 DMA at 0.6435.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Little action on the safe-heaven front thus far although prices seem to have a downside bias against the USD, potentially on the latter’s recovery from its APAC trough. Participants will again be eyeing developments on the US-Sino trade front amid mixed/contrasting recent reports. Meanwhile, the situation in Hong Kong seems to feel some reprieve (for now at least) after the number of protesters trapped inside the Polytechnic University fell from around 700 to between 100-200, however sources cite by the SCMP noted of over 8000 petrol bombs at the Chinese University ready for use. USD/JPY tested and resides around 108.75 (21 DMA) ahead of potential resistance at 108.83 (Tenkan line) with a barrage of options expiring with USD 1bln between 108.50-55 and a further USD 1bln between 108.90-109.00. The Franc also awaits further risk-driven action as USD/CHF meanders around 0.9900 in early EU trade and eyes its 21 DMA at 0.9911.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets eventually traded mostly higher but with gains capped after an initial lack of commitment due to the ongoing US-China uncertainty triggered by contrasting trade headlines, including reports of a pessimistic mood in Beijing about a deal being passed. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) were mixed with Australia lifted as gains in the defensive sectors and recovery in financials superseded the heavy losses in tech, while Tokyo sentiment was snagged by detrimental currency flows and with SoftBank pressured by further WeWork troubles as the New York Attorney General was said to be investigating the embattled workspace company. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) began indecisive but gradually improved as reports of Beijing trade pessimism was offset by a 90-day license extension for US firms to continue doing business with Huawei, while the PBoC also continued its liquidity efforts with another firm injection of CNY 120bln through 7-Day Reverse Repos. Finally, 10yr JGBs were mildly higher as they tracked recent upside in T-notes and amid weakness in Japanese stocks, while demand was also supported by the BoJ’s presence in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are slightly choppy with the region initially lacking commitment amid ongoing US-China uncertainty triggered by contrasting trade headlines, including reports of a pessimistic mood in Beijing regarding a trade deal being passed. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed with gains in the defensive sectors superseding the losses in tech and financials in Australia, while Tokyo sentiment is snagged by detrimental currency flows and as SoftBank is pressured by further WeWork troubles with the New York Attorney General said to be investigating the embattled workspace company. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) began indecisive but gradually improved with reports of Beijing trade pessimism offset by a 90-day license extension for US firms to continue doing business with Huawei, while the PBoC also continued its liquidity efforts with another firm injection of CNY 120bln through 7-Day Reverse Repos.</p><p>In FX markets, the major currencies have mostly consolidated overnight amid a light calendar and as participants await the next developments of the US-China trade saga with the DXY steady after having recovered from the prior day’s trough. The greenback’s transatlantic counterparts are also uneventful with EUR/USD taking a breather after having pulled back from resistance ahead of the 1.1100 handle, while the prior day’s polling-related outperformance in GBP/USD has also petered out with the pair stuck around the 1.2950 level amid a recent warning from EU's Trade Chief Weyand that UK PM Johnson will either only get a “bare bones” trade deal from Brussels next year or none at all citing a lack of time to strike a comprehensive deal. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy as it fails to make any meaningful recovery from yesterday’s collapse through 109.00, and antipodeans are also subdued with mild pressure from the RBA November Minutes which stated the board is prepared to ease further if needed and agreed a case could be made for a rate cut at that meeting but decided to keep policy steady.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the recent upside in T-notes and amid weakness in Japanese stocks, while demand is also underpinned by the BoJ’s presence in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
