(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>The week ended on a positive risk tone as equities and oil emerged firmer with the VIX moving closer to 35. The fundamental backdrop hasn’t changed drastically since Thursday’s remdesivir trial “flop” report, although a Reuters report that US remdesivir trials were running ahead of schedule did provide some support, although gains had been made before then. It appeared to be more that risk has clawed its way back. Alphabet Inc (GOOG) is reportedly planning to cut marketing budgets as much as 50%, according to CNBC citing an internal document. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) will be asked to provide clarity from the House Judiciary Committee to whether or not it misled Congress in a sworn testimony after a WSJ report highlighted the co’s use of third-party data to develop products. Gilead Sciences (GILD) report yesterday that its first trial in China “flopped” is “not correct”, according to a doctor who helped with the study, who added his interpretation does not match with the headline. Note, a research note from Citi notes the report will likely curb the enthusiasm, but the analyst believes the success of the drug is at 50:50. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (LLY) announced it expects to start human testing for its experimental COVID-19 treatment as soon as next month that uses antibodies from those who have recovered from the disease, according to WSJ. Intel (INTC) beat on EPS and revenue, while announced it maintained its dividend, Q2 guidance fell short of expectations and it saw strong DCG and CCG revenues. INTC trade lower however amid a worry that the strong figures will not last as it has seen a boost in business from COVID-19. Verizon (VZ) beat on EPS although missed on revenue while cut its FY20 EPS view and withdrew its revenue forecast. American Express (AXP) beat on EPS, missed on revenue. Its loan loss provisions increased to 2.6bln (exp. 1.3bln), while it committed to no layoffs amid COVID-19 throughout FY20. SPX +1.4% at 2837, NDX +1.7% at 8788, DJI +1.1% at 23,775.</p><p>Choppy day for the Treasury complex, albeit in tight ranges with the 10-year yield bouncing between 58/62bps, before moving lower on the updated Fed purchases schedule. As risk appetite rose in the European session, T-Notes and Bunds were offered from their highs overnight. However, after the US cash equity open gains were pared in equities/oil and yields were anchored from rising any further; note that relatively less corporate issuance likely also supported the Treasury curve. Then later, yields broke out of their range to the downside as investors digested the less pronounced cut in Fed asset purchases of USD 10bln/day from 35bln/day (read below). By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.22, 10s -2bps at 0.59, and 30s -3bps at 1.17%. Meanwhile, Short end rates were supported after the 3-month USD LIBOR posted a chunky 10bps fall, supporting front pack Eurodollars and seeing swap spreads and FRA-OIS tighten. T-notes (M0) settled 3 ticks higher at 139-03+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
