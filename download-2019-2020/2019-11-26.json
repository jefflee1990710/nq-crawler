(Newswires)</p><p>White House Advisor Conway said we are getting 'really close' to a deal with China on trade and cited forced tech transfers, intellectual property theft and trade imbalances as being issues of concern, while Conway earlier noted that some sticking points remain regarding phase one US-China discussions. (Newswires)</p><p>Senior White House official said that despite all the drama a phase one deal remains very close and believes the Chinese will come through with significant concessions on intellectual property protections, while sources noted the phone call among the top officials likely means that Lighthizer and Mnuchin will not travel to Beijing this week for another round of talks. (Politico)</p><p>The mood in Beijing these days is quite different from in late spring when it was only the US side that was trumpeting optimism and talks collapsed, while the stake is even higher now, according to WSJ's Wei. (WSJ/Twitter)</p><p>US Secretary of State Pompeo acknowledged that recently leaked documents confirmed China committed human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims and other minority groups. (Newswires)</p><p>China's Global Times opinion piece suggested that a bill proposed by Republican Senator Cruz called the Taiwan symbols of Sovereignty Act, would have \"disastrous consequences\".

(Newswires)</p><p>Brazil's Economy Minister Guedes said China is coming to Brazil and is sounding us out about a free trade agreement. (Newswires)</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe said QE is not on our agenda and that there is no need to provide extra liquidity via market operations, while he added they will only need QE if Cash Rate falls to 0.25% (currently 0.75%) and reiterated that negative rates are extremely unlikely. Lowe also suggested they are less convinced that other unconventional measures worked and that the jury is still out. (Newswires)</p><p>RBNZ Financial Stability Report noted that New Zealand’s financial system is resilient to a range of economic risks although global financial stability risks and domestic debt vulnerabilities remain, while it added that prolonged low long-term interest rates could generate excess leverage and overheated asset prices. Furthermore, the RBNZ stated it decided to leave the LVR restrictions at current levels at this point in time and that strong capital buffers are key to enabling banks to absorb losses, while it added that a negative OCR is not currently a central scenario in its published forecasts and it is considering potential impacts of unconventional monetary policy tools on bank profitability.

(Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Brainard (Voter, Neutral) calls for a flexible average inflation target and said that shifting target to average 2% over time would be simpler than a stricter rule that commits to an outcome. Brainard added that she is concerned that trend inflation has slipped below 2% and changes to framework are needed to raise it, while she suggested that the Fed should consider capping treasury bond rates in the next crisis rather than relying on sort of QE it used last time. Furthermore, she expects the US economy to grow above trend next year and noted risks to economic outlook are to the downside but sentiment appears to be improving. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Kaplan (2020 voter, neutral) said that the US economy has a good chance of growing at 2% next year and thinks policy is in the right place. However, Kaplan also noted the Dallas Fed expects Q4 to be weak and that weaker productivity is hurting growth, while he suggested the economy needs more than just monetary policy.

There were reassurances out of both the US and China on the proximity of the Phase One deal, although White House advisor Conway cast some scepticism after stating that some differences remained between the two sides. Disney (DIS) found support on an NY Post article citing data that showed its Disney+ service was adding just shy of 1mln new subscribers per day. Opioid makers and distributors (JNJ, TEVA, MCK, MNK, ABC, AMRX) came under pressure after they received subpoenas from federal prosecutors as part of a wider probe. Chipotle (CMG) traded on the front foot amid Cowen upgrading it to Outperform. Iron Mountain (IRM) traded lower after the announcement its CFO would be stepping down. FitBit (FIT) was sold on reports Facebook (FB) was the alterative mystery bidder to Google (GOOGL), but it would not be bidding again. Chesapeake (CHK) was supported by an upgrade at Scotiabank, who expect balance sheet relief sooner than expected. S&amp;P 500 0.2% at 3141, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 8386, Dow Jones 0.2% at 28122.</p><p>The TPLEX found modest support through the session amid the ongoing month-end inflows. Similar to yesterday, the large Treasury issuance and appetite for equities is failing to see a deterioration in US sovereign debt demand – meanwhile there has been little material US-China trade updates. The US sold USD 41bln of 5-year notes at 1.587%, in what was a rather average auction, tailing the WI by 0.3bps and below average domestic demand, although the B/C ratio of 2.5x was above average and the strong international demand saw dealers take less than usual. At settlement, the Treasury curve was slightly flatter, with the 30-year yield down 3bps and the 2-year yield was down slightly under 2bps. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 5+ ticks higher at 129-22.</p>",

Supply: Germany, US.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Little material updates on the China trade front saw major bourses trade within thin ranges despite making new highs (again). There were reassurances out of both the US and China on the proximity of the Phase One deal, although White House advisor Conway to cast some scepticism after stating that some differences remained between the two sides. There was a small flurry of earnings over the past 24 hours in the US, with BBY and HRL emerging stronger, whilst participants shed DLTR, HPE and PANW post their reports. Fed Chair Powell, in addition to Fed's Brainard (voter) and Kaplan (2020 voter), spoke, but there was little to scrutinise there with all three expressing content for policy being on hold. On the data front, US October advance trade goods showed a smaller deficit than December, new home sales beat expectations with upward revisions (in a further ode to the recent rebound in the housing market), whilst the headline consumer confidence missed expectations for November, but short-term expectations improved modestly. Treasuries were modestly higher, trading off similar themes to Monday, with month-end rebalancing being supportive and the week's slate of issuance working against the complex; other haven, XAU, was also firmer on Tuesday. UK election polls continued to show a modest narrowing of the Tory lead, helping GBP pare back some of Monday's gains.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA CALL: </strong>USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin held a call with China's Vice Premier Liu He, China's Commerce Ministry said, with negotiators continuing to discuss issues around the phase one trade deal, and sides agreed to maintain communications on remaining issues (the PBOC governor was also on the call, reports said). There was also a discussion of \"core issues of concern\" and the negotiators reached \"a common understanding on resolving relevant problems,\" it said. News of the call lead to a fleeting bounce in risk in the APAC session, although moves were faded as participants did not have too much by way of new info to take away from the call; crucially, traders are still awaiting a guide on whether the 15th December tariffs are likely (15% on USD 160bln of foods imported from China to the US). The phase one deal was supposed to be signed in November, but has been held up as Beijing seeks an extensive tariff rollback, which the US seems reticent to do; this week, reports have also suggested that China sees the more ambitious phase two part of the deal as less likely, while it has also warned of US interference in Hong Kong, complicating the path to a deal.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA PROGRESS:</strong> From the US side, commentary was constructive. A senior white house official said that, despite all the drama, a phase one deal remains \"very close\", Politico reported, with the source also under the impression that China will come through with significant concessions on intellectual property protections, and its officials were reportedly briefing foreign visitors last Friday that it was positive about the trajectory of the talks, but said the scope and scale of US tariff de-escalation is still an open question. Politico also said that the overnight phone call among the top negotiators meant it was likely that USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin would not travel to Beijing this week for another round of talks. The White House advisor Conway said that some sticking points remain regarding the Phase One discussions (tech transfers, intellectual property theft and trade imbalances), though said the sides were getting 'really close' to a deal.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG: </strong>China’s Foreign Ministry announced it had summoned the US ambassador to strongly protest legislation backing Hong Kong's protest movement, demanding it be scrapped or \"bear all the consequences\". The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which Congress passed last week, supports human rights and democracy in the territory, and threatens to revoke the territory's special trading arrangements; the Bill is still to be signed by President Trump, who is more than aware of the ramifications that it may have for US/China trade talks.</p><p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL:</strong> In remarks overnight, the Fed chair stuck to the script, reiterating that the Fed has a favourable outlook for the US economy on strong consumer spending, a robust job market, increasing incomes and solid consumer confidence. Powell also reiterated the risks facing the US economy from weak global growth and trade uncertainty, and the Fed would \"respond accordingly\" if incoming data resulted in a \"material reassessment\" of its economic outlook. However, Powell's sees the \"glass as much more than half full\". The Fed chair also reiterated policy was not on a pre-set course.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Brainard (voter) towed the Fed policy line, saying that she will be watching data carefully for any signs of a material change to the outlook, then policy changes would be required; expects US economy to grow above trend next year, but risks to the outlook are to the downside, although sentiment appears to be improving, she caveated, in addition to recent strong housing data showing the Fed’s rate cuts had been having a positive impact. Brainard expressed concern that trend inflation has slipped below 2% and changes to the framework are needed to raise it. In the next crisis, she said the Fed should consider capping treasury bond rates - rather than relying on the sort of QE it used last time - where short- to medium-term securities would be focused on, but the credibility of policy would mean purchases of bonds may only need to be limited, she added. The Board of Governors member also said the costs of NIRP are not worth the benefits. Fed’s Kaplan (2020 voter) echoed that policy was is in the right place on a CNBC interview, adding that the US economy has a good chance of growing at 2% next year, but expects Q4 to be weak. The Dallas Fed President nodded to fiscal policy, saying that the economy needs more than just monetary policy. He also, when asked, expressed he is worried about is a wave of Triple-B downgrades, which would have the potential to result in credit tightening</p><p><strong>* US NOV CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Headline consumer confidence missed expectations and fell in the month (125.5 vs expected 127.0; prior revised down to 125.9 from 126.1). The Conference Board said that November's decline was due to a softening in consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions, while the decline in the Present Situation Index suggests that economic growth in the final quarter of 2019 will remain weak. With that said, the CB did say that consumers' short-term expectations improved modestly, and growth in early 2020 was likely to remain at around the 2% mark. It also added that, overall, confidence levels are still high and should support solid spending during this holiday season. Elsewhere, the differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' narrowed to 32.1 from 35.1, which some analysts consider to be a negative signal for the jobless rate within the employment situation report, released next week.</p><p><strong>* US OCT ADVANCE TRADE GOODS BALANCE: </strong>The advanced goods trade deficit narrowed to USD 66.53bln from USD 70.55bln (the consensus view looked for USD 71.3bln). Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the consensus always looked too gloomy, following the release of data on container movements at major ports pointing to a clear drop in imports. The consultancy observes that imports of consumer goods have plunged by a total of 9.0% since August and suggests that may be in response to the new tariffs on many imported Chinese consumer goods - something that Pantheon thinks will reverse in part soon. Exports, meanwhile, fell by 0.7%, with most of the decline in the consumer goods component. \"An improvement in the trade deficit thanks to falling imports, signalling soft domestic demand, is rarely as welcome as one driven by rising exports,\" PM writes, \"Either way, though, falling trade deficit boosts GDP growth, other things equal, so the immediate consequence of this report will be to lift estimates of Q4 GDP growth.\" PM suggests that the impact will hinge on the extent to which forecasters assume mean reversion or a correction in November and December.</p><p><strong>* US OCT NEW HOME SALES: </strong>New home sales printed 0.733mln units in October, against an expected 0.709mln, and a previous upward revised 0.738mln. BMO's analysts said the last two months have been the best back-to-back prints in over a decade, as the stimulative impact of lower rates continues to permeate throughout the housing sector. Moreover, BMO says, the Case Shiller data for September (out earlier in the day) also showed stronger home price growth than assumed, further emphasising the banks' point.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> Following yesterday’s ICM poll which saw the Conservatives lead shrink to 7 points from 10, further evidence of a narrowing in the poll came this morning in the form of the latest Kantar Poll; the poll put support for the Conservatives at 43% (-2), Labour 32% (+5), Liberal Democrats 14% (-2) and Brexit Party 3% (+1). Blonde Money suggest that due to the fact that the narrowing in the polls is largely due to undecided voters “showing their hands” and&nbsp; faltering support for the Conservatives, this could actually help the Conservatives; the greater Labour threat could shore up the Tory vote, while faltering support for the Liberal Democrats should help the Conservatives in marginal seats. Regardless, attention now turns to YouGov’s Wednesday night release of its MPR election forecasting model, the first forecast to be released based on constituency by constituency analysis as opposed to analysis on the national level. There is some excitement relating to the release given that the model accurately predicted a hung parliament in the 2017 election, when at the time polling looked similar to what it does now, and also accurately predicted first time Labour victories in the Kensington and Canterbury.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 5+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-22. </strong>The<strong> </strong>TPLEX found modest support through the session amid the ongoing month-end inflows. Similar to yesterday, the large Treasury issuance and appetite for equities is failing to see a deterioration in US sovereign debt demand – meanwhile there has been little material US-China trade updates. The US sold USD 41bln of 5-year notes at 1.587%, in what was a rather average auction, tailing the WI by 0.3bps and below average domestic demand, although the B/C ratio of 2.5x was above average and the strong international demand saw dealers take less than usual. At settlement, the Treasury curve was slightly flatter, with the 30-year yield down 3bps, whilst the 2-year yield was down slightly under 2bps.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Monday), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Tuesday), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Wednesday). Analysts at UBS say that the Treasury will give some USD 92bln in cash redemptions and coupon payments this week, implying net cash flows of around 21bln.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The previous two auctions have been digested well, both stopping through the screens (the last by the largest margin since the March auction); demand from investment funds and foreign bidders was strong. The 7-year part of the curve trades fair in asset swap against older 7s, SocGen says, though it trades cheap versus 5s and 10s. The current WI trades above the last three auction stop-out rates, which the bank says emphasises the cheapness of the sector on an outright basis versus the recent auction cycles. SocGen also notes that dealer holdings in the 6- to 7-year bucket are low, which may benefit the sale. SocGen says it is positive on the auction but notes that the Q3 GDP data (second reading) ahead of the auction may set the tone. \"Also, it should be noted that the 7-year note auction will close early on 27 November because of the Thanksgiving holiday, and the demand for the 7-year auction might be affected because of the holiday-shortened week.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 0.40 HIGHER AT USD 58.41/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.62 HIGHER AT USD 64.27/BBL. </strong>Crude markets finished slightly higher, following another choppy day of trade which saw front-month WTI and Brent futures whipsaw between the USD 57.75/bbl to USD 58.55/bbl and USD 63.45/bbl to USD 64.22/bbl marks, respectively. Crude market-pertinent news flow was light; Tass reported that OPEC are considering extending oil production cuts by 3-6 months, in fitting with other recent reports. On which note, comments from IEA’s Birol also crossed wires, calling for OPEC to make the right decision for the global economy, which remains “very fragile”. On the topic of US production, Birol said he expected production growth in the shale oil sector to slow from its previously \"explosive\" levels, mainly due to the financial difficulties faced by some US shale producers. Attention now turns to API inventories data after market; headline crude stocks are seen drawing by 0.4mln bbls, distillates building 0.8mln bbls and gasoline building 1.2mln bbls. Note: Brent (F0) options expire on Tuesday, likely leading to an element of book squaring in the session’s tape action.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.2% at 3141, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 8386, Dow Jones 0.2% at 28122</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.8%, Consumer Staples 0.8%, Energy -1%, Financials -0.1%, Health Care -0.1%, Industrials 0.3%, Information Technology 0.1%, Materials 0.5%, Telecommunication Service 0.4%, Utilities 0.4%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Best Buy (BBY) surged on a stellar earnings report and guidance. Hormel Foods (HRL) moved higher through the session despite a mixed report. Dollar Tree (DLTR) dived lower following a profit miss and dismal guidance; competitor Dollar General (DG) was also weighed on. Analog Devices (ADI) opened lower on a poor quarter and disappointing next quarter guidance, although did reverse course with wider risk sentiment. Hewlett Packard (HPE) took a haircut on a top line miss and lacklustre guidance. PVH (PVH) ultimately rose on a strong quarter, but guidance was mixed. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was a double-digit victim despite beating top and bottom line estimates, after its pinnacle firewall sales were poor, as was guidance. Agilent Technologies (A) traded subdued on disappointing profit guidance for the year. Dick’s (DKS) surged on an all-round good report.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Disney (DIS) found support on an NY Post article citing data that showed its Disney+ service was adding just shy of 1mln new subscribers per day. Opioid makers and distributors (JNJ, TEVA, MCK, MNK, ABC, AMRX) came under pressure after they received subpoenas from federal prosecutors as part of a wider probe. Chipotle (CMG) traded on the front foot amid Cowen upgrading it to Outperform. Iron Mountain (IRM) traded lower after the announcement its CFO would be stepping down. FitBit (FIT) was sold on reports Facebook (FB) was the alterative mystery bidder to Google (GOOGL), but it would not be bidding again. Chesapeake (CHK) was supported by an upgrade at Scotiabank, who expect balance sheet relief sooner than expected.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD yet again saw choppy price action, likely driven by month end factors with many of the moves lacking fundamental reasoning, although the index traded marginally lower heading into the overnight session. DXY traded in a range of 98.25 and<strong> </strong>98.38, a high which coincided with choppy trade just after the US equity cash open. Despite a flurry of contradicting US/China trade headlines, CNH traded firmer against the buck today edging ever so closer to the highly eyed 7.00 handle<strong> </strong>as the USDCNH cross saw lows of 7.01.<strong> Havens </strong>however<strong> </strong>were mixed, JPY slightly weaker, XAU firmer and CHF flat against the greenback. USDJPY flirted around the 109-handle yet again only briefly breaching the 200dma at 108.93 early in the morning. XAU was firmer likely taking some of its direction from a slightly softer Dollar and mixed US/China updates, the precious metal gradually rose throughout the session from lows of 1450 seen just after the US equity open (a time when DXY traded around its session highs), but quickly retraced price action and trades around highs of 1462 in the tail end of the session. <strong>Antipodes</strong> were firmer on the day; AUD saw highs of 0.6795 after RBA Governor Lowe pushed back on QE and unconventional monetary policy measures, unless the economic picture worsens drastically. Overnight gains however were shortlived, although the Aussie managed to claw back the post Lowe losses and trades just shy of highs heading into the Asia-Pac session, NZD largely followed direction of its Antipodean counterpart, whilst also being supported by strong retail sales last night. <strong>EMFX</strong> traded weaker yet again despite a falling buck today. TRY traded lower after reports that Russia and Turkey are to sign a second S-400 regiment contract, a move Pompeo said was concerning. <strong>BRL</strong> printed fresh record lows again with USDBRL reaching 4.2770 at highs. However, some reprieve was given to the Real as the BCB intervened twice on Tuesday, albeit the Real still traded lower to close the US session.</p><p><strong>* RBA GOVERNOR LOWE: </strong>RBA Governor Lowe outlined that QE will only be needed if the Cash Rate falls to 0.25% from its current level of 0.75%. “QE is not on our agenda,” Lowe said, before adding that there is no need to provide extra liquidity via market operations. The RBA Governor also said that the jury is still out on unconventional policy measures and is “less convinced” that they have worked. On NIRP, Lowe said that the likelihood is extremely unlikely. The market interpreted the Governor’s comments as initially hawkish, with AUD paring in the aftermath, as the comments served to dampen expectations for QE any time soon.</p>",

Crude market-pertinent news flow was light; Tass reported that OPEC are considering extending oil production cuts by 3-6 months, in fitting with other recent reports. On which note, comments from IEA’s Birol also crossed wires, calling for OPEC to make the right decision for the global economy, which remains “very fragile”. On the topic of US production, Birol said he expected production growth in the shale oil sector to slow from its previously \"explosive\" levels, mainly due to the financial difficulties faced by some US shale producers. Attention now turns to API inventories data after market; headline crude stocks are seen drawing by 0.4mln bbls, distillates building 0.8mln bbls and gasoline building 1.2mln bbls. Note: Brent (F0) options expire on Tuesday, likely leading to an element of book squaring in the session’s tape action.</li></ul>",

Many directors reported that consumer spending was strong or holding steady, although some directors noted that growth in consumer spending had moderated. Several directors reported weakness in the manufacturing sector and slowing business investment. In most Districts, labor markets remained tight. Some directors also noted wage pressures, particularly for low-skilled positions. Many directors cited the ongoing uncertainty about trade developments, along with weaker global growth, as risks to the U.S. economic outlook.

Analysts at UBS say that the Treasury will give some USD 92bln in cash redemptions and coupon payments this week, implying net cash flows of around 21bln. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> Last month's auction saw decent demand from investment funds. The current 5s note appears to be trading fair in asset swap vs older 5s, SocGen says, while it appears to be slightly cheap on the curve against 2s and 10s. SocGen argues that the auction appears to be cheap on an outright basis, given that the current WI is trading above all stop out rates of the last three auctions. Additionally, the bank says that relatively low dealer holdings in the 3-6 year bucket should also support demand at the auction. The bank holds a positive bias into the sale. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* RECENT 5-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>• High-yield: (prev. 1.57%, six-auction avg. 1.703%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Tail: (prev. -0.4bps, six-auction avg. 0.2bps)&nbsp;</p><p>• Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.41x, six-auction avg. 2.37x)&nbsp;</p><p>• Dealers: (prev. 22.8%, six-auction avg. 25.3%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Direct: (prev. 11.5%, six-auction avg. 16.0%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Indirect: (prev. 65.7%, six-auction avg. 58.7%)&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and index with the Index gained some traction shortly after the US cash open and rose to fresh session highs of 98.38, having traded in the relatively flat throughout most of the EU session. US-China news-flow has once again proved contradicting in terms of sentiment, with some sources pointing to an imminent deal and others highlighting remaining sticking points. Trade aside, markets seem to be reacting more in accordance with month-end flows given the holiday-shorted trading week. DXY remains near session highs heading into the EU close with a busy state-side docket to look forward to tomorrow – including Durable goods, GDP (2nd) and PCE prices. USD/CNH meanwhile, has remained relatively caged within an intraday range of 7.0184-0422 thus far, but off highs and above its 21 DMA at 7.0231.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling remained the main G10 loser heading into the European close amid the latest polls indicating a narrowing gap in Tory’s lead over Labour, with today’s Kantar and ICM polls showing the lead tightening to 11 (Prev. 18) and 7 (Prev. 10) points respectively. That said, Labour leader Corbyn has attracted further unwanted attention after UK’s Chief Rabbi deemed the leader of the opposition party unfit for office due to the party’s anti-Semitism crisis. GBP/USD remained below its 21 DMA (1.2879) and continued on its downward trajectory and briefly dipped below 1.2850 to find bids at 1.2845 ahead of touted support lines at 1.2841 and 1.2822 - with eyes now on tomorrow’s YouGov MRP model (at 22:00GMT) which correctly predicted a hung parliament result back in 2017. Elsewhere, the Single Currency has been uneventful but managed to retain a 1.10+ status heading into the European close, though it failed to derive much impetus from the modest improvement in the German Gfk consumer sentiment, whiles ECB speakers added little to the narrative. EUR/USD hovers near mid-range having clocked in a tight 1.1008-24 range during the day thus far. Looking ahead, tomorrow’s docket for the UK and EU remains scarce with only ECB’s Lane and de Cos of note.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Both poised to end the EU session little changed after the stronger Dollar wiped out earlier gains in the AUD, which saw some impetus on RBA Governor Lowe’s push back on QE and unconventional measures until Australia sees a bleaker economic picture. The Governor stated that QE will only be needed in the case of two more 25bps rate cuts, (i.e. the Cash Rate at 0.25%) and reaffirmed that negative rates in Aussie are extremely unlikely – comments that were perceived as hawkish given the shift from the Central Bank’s rhetoric earlier in the year. AUD/USD initially derived support from the Governor but the pair stopped short of the 0.6800 level to the upside (high of 0.6795 vs. a low of 0.6770), albeit the pair has given up the gains as the Dollar climbed off lows. Meanwhile, the Kiwi throughout most of the session remained supported by overnight NZ retail sales data and heads into the EU close just about maintaining a 0.64+ status having traded within a 0.6407-27 band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Overall moving in tandem with the Dollar with the pair flip-flopping either side of 109.00 heading into the end of the session, with little in terms of concrete sentiment dictating the state of play for safe-haven FX. USD/JPY is poised to end the session above the 109.0 mark having clocked in a 108.88-109.20 intraday band.</p>",

(U/C) </strong>opened positively on the recent trade optimism although the gains were later trimmed after another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC and as Alibaba’s debut threatened to shun the regional darlings, while a brief spike in risk appetite attributed to algos reacting to news US and China trade negotiators held a phone call and reached a consensus on solving issues, later faded given the actual lack of fresh solid developments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured in early trade by the lack of safe-haven demand and with participants sidelined heading into the 40yr auction, which eventually showed firmer demand and spurred a rebound in prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 120bln. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 7.0344 vs. Exp. 7.0344 (Prev. 7.0397)</strong></p><p><strong>China and US trade negotiators held a phone call today in which they reached a consensus on solving issues and agreed to keep in contact regarding phase one deal</strong>. MOFCOM noted the talks were held by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, while Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong, PBoC Governor Yi and NDRC Vice Chief Ning also participated in talks. Furthermore, USTR Lighthizer later confirmed the call with China but declined to comment on specifics. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>China's Global Times tweeted that topics in the call may have included tariff removal, agricultural purchase and a possible face-to-face meeting citing experts close to trade talks</strong>. Furthermore, Global Times later reiterated that China and the US have basically reached broad consensus on a phase one trade deal including the removal of tariffs, although some differences remain over how much tariffs should be rolled back citing experts close to the talks. (Twitter)</p><p>US</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell said Fed would respond if developments cause material reassessment of the outlook and that current monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as economic data is consistent with moderate growth</strong>, while he suggested that policymakers’ favourable outlook is founded on strong household spending and that monetary policy is well positioned to support labour market as well as the 2% inflation target. However, Powell also noted yellow flags in the economy including muted inflation and that lower monthly job gains suggests an economy with somewhat less momentum than previously thought. (Newswires)</p><p>US House Speaker Pelosi said we are within range of a substantially improved US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and that they need to see the progress in writing from USTR Lighthizer for final review.

(Newswires)</p><p>Lord Kerslake, a senior adviser to the Labour Party has suggested that Jeremy Corbyn’s position as head of the party could be up for discussion as part of the price of a pact with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. (Telegraph)</p><p>German GfK Consumer Sentiment (Dec) 9.7 vs. Exp. 9.6 (Prev. 9.6). (Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%) </strong>are modestly softer as recent upwards momentum seen in global equities subsides amidst a lack of fresh fundamental drivers. Another bout of seemingly positive US/China news-flow overnight, in which the two sides reportedly held a phone call where they reached a “consensus on solving issues” and “agreed to keep in contact”, largely failed to lift sentiment; Lloyds argue that negotiators will now need to “walk the talk”, i.e. show real evidence of progress, if further market risk appetite is to be stoked. It is also worth noting that a number of banks’ month end rebalancing models forecast flows out of equities and into bonds – another factor potentially behind this morning’s moves. Sectors are mostly in the red, bar Tech (+0.3.), Materials (Unch), Healthcare (+0.1%) and Consumer Staples (+0.3%). In terms of equity specific movers; Faurecia (+1.0%) had a strong start to the session on the news that it targets FY revenue above EUR 20.5bln and had confirmed its FY targets, although the stock eventually gave back the majority of its gains. Valeo (-0.3%) opened higher in sympathy, before gains were also eroded. Similarly, Peugeot (-0.4%) and Fiat Chrysler (-0.1%) also struggled to hold on to early gains, which were spurred by the news that both Cos had told employees via internal communication that they would sign a binding merger agreement in the coming weeks. Enel (-0.5%) is lower despite decent earnings in which it raised its FY20 EBITDA guidance and increased its dividend. Elsewhere, Compass Group (-5.2%) sunk after earnings underwhelmed, while EasyJet (Unch.) managed to fight off early losses sustained after the Co. was downgraded to hold from buy at Berenberg.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>Russia and Turkey are reportedly to sign the second S-400 missile system regiment contract in 2020. (Ria)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR -</strong> Sterling has lost its recent impetus in light of fresh polls depicting a narrowing Tory lead over labour, with the latest Kantar poll showing an 11-point gap vs. 18 last week, whilst the overnight ICM polls indicated a narrowing to 7 points from 10 in the previous week. That said, it’s worth caveating that Labour’s handling of its anti-Semitism crisis has garnered some focus with Chief Rabbi Mirvus suggesting that Labour Leader Corbyn is not fit for office. Cable dipped back below the 1.2900 mark (having flatlined around the figure throughout APAC hours) and continues to drift lower to session lows having traded within a 1.2852-2907 intraday band thus far. Meanwhile, the Single Currency remains little changed and within a tight range of 1.008-19 with no pertinent comments from ECB speakers so far and with touted support at 1.1004 ahead of the round figure.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD - </strong>The Aussie took top spot among the G10 gainers as RBA Governor Lowe pushed back on QE and unconventional measures until Australia sees a bleaker economic picture. The Governor stated that QE will only be needed in the case of two more 25bps rate cuts, (i.e. the Cash Rate at 0.25%) and reaffirmed that negative rates in Aussie are extremely unlikely. All-in-all a hawkish outlook on monetary policy against the backdrop of recent economic data, and especially given the Central Bank’s rhetoric earlier in the year that unconventional tools are prepared to be rolled out if warranted – which also prompted most house views to converge towards QE at some point next year.

A number of ECB speakers were scheduled though little in the way of pertinent monetary policy remarks emerged. As such, Bunds are firmer at present but once again remain within confined ranges, circa 40 ticks for the session at present, and only marginally above the opening level of 171.04; technically, to the upside recent highs are above the day’s band at 171.35. Gilts are the outperformer in Europe today deriving support from a number of polls showing that the Tory-Labour gap has narrowed, to as little as a 7pp gap via ICM/Reuters. Though, it is worth caveating that focus is very much on tomorrow’s YouGov MRP release which successfully predicted the 2017 hung parliament. UK debt has recently breached mid-October highs at 133.55. Elsewhere, UBS note that volumes yesterday were around 30% below the average for the last ten-days for Bunds and USTs due to the shortened holiday week. Stateside, USTs are marginally firmer roughly in-line with the Bund as Fed’s Chair Powell’s remarks last night added little to the current narrative and ahead of a number of data prints, given the limited price action the curve shape is only very marginally flatter.

There has been little by way of fresh crude specific fundamental drivers, however, looking ahead, forecasts for tonight’s API Inventory data predict a 939mln bbl draw. ING highlight that the last stock drawdowns were seen in mid-October – some desks have suggested that some of the upside seen this morning could be the market “front-running” tonight inventory report. Looking to the rest of the week; OPEC’s Economic Commission Board is set to meet on Wednesday and Thursday and will then likely make a recommendation on what OPEC should do regarding of production cuts over the course of 2020. While the board can make a recommendation, there is no certainty that OPEC ministers will follow this advice as they ultimately make the decision. Looking at the metals; <strong>gold</strong> is a touch firmer, moving north of USD 1464/bbl. In terms of physical demand for the precious metal; ING point to data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics, which shows that non-monetary gold imports declined by 43% M/M to a three year low of 34.9 tonnes in October, leaving YTD gold imports down 41% Y/Y. Stronger gold prices, a weaker currency and slowing growth have weighed on retail gold demand in the country, suggests the bank, citing similar reasons for the physical demand slowdown in India. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> is more rangebound, as the red metal pulls back after making two-week highs yesterday.</p>",

Another bout of seemingly positive US/China news-flow overnight, in which the two sides reportedly held a phone call where they reached a “consensus on solving issues” and “agreed to keep in contact”, largely failed to lift sentiment; Lloyds argue that negotiators will now need to “walk the talk”, i.e. show real evidence of progress, if further market risk appetite is to be stoked. It is also worth noting that a number of banks’ month end rebalancing models forecast flows out of equities and into bonds – another factor potentially behind this morning’s moves. Sectors are mostly in the red, bar Tech (+0.3.), Materials (Unch), Healthcare (+0.1%) and Consumer Staples (+0.3%). In terms of equity specific movers; Faurecia (+1.0%) had a strong start to the session on the news that it targets FY revenue above EUR 20.5bln and had confirmed its FY targets, although the stock eventually gave back the majority of its gains. Valeo (-0.3%) opened higher in sympathy, before gains were also eroded. Similarly, Peugeot (-0.4%) and Fiat Chrysler (-0.1%) also struggled to hold on to early gains, which were spurred by the news that both Cos had told employees via internal communication that they would sign a binding merger agreement in the coming weeks. Enel (-0.5%) is lower despite decent earnings in which it raised its FY20 EBITDA guidance and increased its dividend. Elsewhere, Compass Group (-5.2%) sunk after earnings underwhelmed, while EasyJet (Unch.) managed to fight off early losses sustained after the Co. was downgraded to hold from buy at Berenberg.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP, EUR - Sterling has lost its recent impetus in light of fresh polls depicting a narrowing Tory lead over labour, with the latest Kantar poll showing an 11-point gap vs. 18 last week, whilst the overnight ICM polls indicated a narrowing to 7 points from 10 in the previous week. That said, it’s worth caveating that Labour’s handling of its anti-Semitism crisis has garnered some focus with Chief Rabbi Mirvus suggesting that Labour Leader Corbyn is not fit for office. Cable dipped back below the 1.2900 mark (having flatlined around the figure throughout APAC hours) and continues to drift lower to session lows having traded within a 1.2863-2907 intraday band thus far. Meanwhile, the Single Currency remains little changed and within a tight range of 1.008-19 with no pertinent comments from ECB speakers so far and with touted support at 1.1004 ahead of the round figure.</p><p>AUD, NZD - The Aussie took top spot among the G10 gainers as RBA Governor Lowe pushed back on QE and unconventional measures until Australia sees a bleaker economic picture. The Governor stated that QE will only be needed in the case of two more 25bps rate cuts, (i.e. the Cash Rate at 0.25%) and reaffirmed that negative rates in Aussie are extremely unlikely. All-in-all a hawkish outlook on monetary policy against the backdrop of recent economic data, and especially given the Central Bank’s rhetoric earlier in the year that unconventional tools are prepared to be rolled out if warranted – which also prompted most house views to converge towards QE at some point next year. Unsurprisingly, AUD/USD derived support from the Governor but the pair stopped short of the 0.6800 level to the upside vs. a low of 0.6770, albeit the pair has given up the gains as the Dollar climbs off lows.

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: Sterling stained by latest polling and Lowe lifted AUD",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling has lost its recent impetus in light of fresh polls depicting a narrowing Tory lead over labour, with the latest Kantar poll showing an 11-point gap vs. 18 last week, whilst the overnight ICM polls indicated a narrowing to 7 points from 10 in the previous week. That said, it’s worth caveating that Labour’s handling of its anti-Semitism crisis has garnered some focus with Chief Rabbi Mirvus suggesting that Labour Leader Corbyn is not fit for office. Cable dipped back below the 1.2900 mark (having flatlined around the figure throughout APAC hours) and continues to drift lower to session lows having traded within a 1.2863-2907 intraday band thus far. Meanwhile, the Single Currency remains little changed and within a tight range of 1.008-19 with no pertinent comments from ECB speakers so far and with touted support at 1.1004 ahead of the round figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie took top spot among the G10 gainers as RBA Governor Lowe pushed back on QE and unconventional measures until Australia sees a bleaker economic picture. The Governor stated that QE will only be needed in the case of two more 25bps rate cuts, (i.e. the Cash Rate at 0.25%) and reaffirmed that negative rates in Aussie are extremely unlikely. All-in-all a hawkish outlook on monetary policy against the backdrop of recent economic data, and especially given the Central Bank’s rhetoric earlier in the year that unconventional tools are prepared to be rolled out if warranted – which also prompted most house views to converge towards QE at some point next year. Unsurprisingly, AUD/USD derived support from the Governor but the pair stopped short of the 0.6800 level to the upside vs. a low of 0.6770, albeit the pair has given up the gains as the Dollar climbs off lows. Meanwhile, the Kiwi remains supported by overnight NZ retail sales data but now trades relatively flat and still retains its 0.64+ status having earlier dipped to proximity of the round figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY, JPY</strong></p><p>Minimal action in the DXY thus far as the Index continues its APAC sideways trade around 98.30 having printed a tight intraday range of 98.26-35. Overnight, Fed Chair Powell failed to provide much by way of new substance, whilst the latest in the US-Sino trade saga did little to inspire the Buck. Looking at the state-side calendar, Adv. Goods trade balance and Richmond Fed may attract some attention on a quiet day ahead of Fed-voter Brainard’s speech on monetary policy and tools. Similarly, the Japanese Yen has been stuck within a relatively narrow band at 108.90-109.20. The pair knee-jerked to session high overnight, potentially on algo-related action on trade headlines regarding a call between Chinese and US trade negotiators, albeit the move was short lived as it provided little substance. USD/JPY meanders around its 200 DMA at 108.93 with around USD 500mln of options expiring around 108.90-109.0 and USD 2.3bln at 109.50.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Modest downside bias in the Turkish Lira amid jitters that its S-400 radar tests could provoke US lawmakers and result in sanctions. Further, reports stated that Russia and Turkey are mulling signing the second regiment contract for the Russian-made defence system. Turkey’s President more-or-less shrugged questions about resolving the dispute with US whilst reaffirming his pledge that interest rates will fall to single digits from the current 14%, albeit a timeframe was not mentioned. USD/TRY remains on the offensive having breached 5.7500 to the upside after multiple attempts and briefly surpassed its 50 DMA at 5.7509 (vs. low of 5.7355). Elsewhere, the Rand continues to be weighed on by the recent downbeat outlook from the IMF coupled with S&amp;P’s outlook downward outlook revision. USD/ZAR found a base at 14.7500 and topped its 100 DMA at 14.7940 to print a current high of around 14.8500.&nbsp;</p>",

A number of ECB speakers were scheduled though little in the way of pertinent monetary policy remarks emerged. As such, Bunds are firmer at present but once again remain within confined ranges, circa 40 ticks for the session at present, and only marginally above the opening level of 171.04; technically, to the upside recent highs are above the day’s band at 171.35. Gilts are the outperformer in Europe today deriving support from a number of polls showing that the Tory-Labour gap has narrowed, to as little as a 7pp gap via ICM/Reuters. Though, it is worth caveating that focus is very much on tomorrow’s YouGov MRP release which successfully predicted the 2017 hung parliament. UK debt remains capped by the psychological 133.50 mark and above this mid-October highs at 133.55. Elsewhere, UBS note that volumes yesterday were around 30% below the average for the last ten-days for Bunds and USTs due to the shortened holiday week. Stateside, USTs are marginally firmer roughly in-line with the Bund as Fed’s Chair Powell’s remarks last night added little to the current narrative and ahead of a number of data prints, given the limited price action the curve shape is only very marginally flatter. Note; today sees supply from the UK and US.</p>",

(+0.1%) </strong>opened positively on the recent trade optimism although the gains were later trimmed after another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC and as Alibaba’s debut threatened to shun the regional darlings, while a brief spike in risk appetite attributed to algos reacting to news US and China trade negotiators held a phone call and reached a consensus on solving issues, later faded given the actual lack of fresh solid developments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured in early trade by the lack of safe-haven demand and with participants sidelined heading into the 40yr auction, which eventually showed firmer demand and spurred a rebound in prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 120bln. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 7.0344 vs. Exp. 7.0344 (Prev. 7.0397)</strong></p><p><strong>China and US trade negotiators held a phone call today in which they reached a consensus on solving issues and agreed to keep in contact regarding phase one deal</strong>. MOFCOM noted the talks were held by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, while Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong, PBoC Governor Yi and NDRC Vice Chief Ning also participated in talks. Furthermore, USTR Lighthizer later confirmed the call with China but declined to comment on specifics. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>China's Global Times tweeted that topics in the call may have included tariff removal, agricultural purchase and a possible face-to-face meeting citing experts close to trade talks</strong>. Furthermore, Global Times later reiterated that China and the US have basically reached broad consensus on a phase one trade deal including the removal of tariffs, although some differences remain over how much tariffs should be rolled back citing experts close to the talks.

(Telegraph)</p><p><strong>ECB's Lane</strong> said the yield curve plays a key role for the transmission of monetary policy, under both standard and non-standard policy measures, while Lane added the ECB will be in the bond market for a long time and is signalling quantitative tightening but far in the future. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> consolidated following yesterday’s choppy price action with overnight comments from Fed Chair Powell not providing much to spur prices as he reiterated the Fed will respond accordingly if developments cause a material reassessment of the economic outlook and that current monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as economic data is consistent with moderate growth. The greenback’s major counterparts were uneventful with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> languishing just north of 1.1000 and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> rangebound near 1.2900 after conflicting projections in which the latest ICM poll showed a 7-point lead for the Conservatives which is a far cry from the 19-point margin suggested by the recent Opinium survey. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> reclaimed 109.00 on the improved risk appetite and with the gains momentarily exacerbated by the phone call between US and China trade negotiators, although this was faded shortly after alongside the retracement in stocks, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> conformed to the humdrum picture seen in the currency space with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> only briefly supported by better than expected New Zealand Retail Sales data.</p><p>New Zealand Retail Sales (Q3) Q/Q 1.6% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.2%). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were lacklustre as they failed to take their cue from the mostly positive risk appetite in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures were contained by resistance around the USD 58.00/bbl level and some analysts even suggested the holiday-shortened week and month-end factors could also be contributing to the recent indecision. Nonetheless, focus for the complex shifts to the upcoming inventory data beginning with the API report due after-hours today. <strong>Gold</strong> remained subdued overnight with the precious metal weighed by a lack of safe-haven demand and amid an uneventful greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> conformed to the uneventful tone across the complex not helped by the somewhat flimsy sentiment in China.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>Iranian-backed Houthis reportedly launched a large-scale attack against Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen which is said to have left hundreds of casualties including Saudi, Emirati and Sudanese nationals. (MasirahTV/Elinor News)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Russia and Turkey are reportedly to sign the second S-400 missile system regiment contract in 2020. (Ria)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>T-notes edged higher on Monday despite a strong US equity market performance putting constraint on the bid for havens. Participants also could be cautious on US debt markets given the large Treasury supply this week, although month-end rebalancing out of equities and into Treasuries is also likely providing support. The shape of the curve was little changed at settlement with yields lower between one and two basis points. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 2 ticks higher at 1929-16+.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell said Fed would respond if developments cause material reassessment of the outlook and that current monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as economic data is consistent with moderate growth</strong>, while he suggested that policymakers’ favourable outlook is founded on strong household spending and that monetary policy is well positioned to support labour market as well as the 2% inflation target. However, Powell also noted yellow flags in the economy including muted inflation and that lower monthly job gains suggests an economy with somewhat less momentum than previously thought. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said the USMCA trade agreement is on House Speaker Pelosi's desk and suggested she is incapable of moving it</strong>, while he added that Mexico and Canada might pull the deal pretty soon and that if they do pull it, it is her fault and not his. However, there were later comments from Pelosi who said we are within range of a substantially improved US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and that they need to see the progress in writing from USTR Lighthizer for final review.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade higher across the board as they take impetus from the fresh record levels on Wall Street where sentiment was underpinned by the US-China trade optimism and a relatively busy day of takeover activity. ASX 200 (+0.7%) is positive with the energy sector leading the broad gains across Australia’s sectors as Caltex registers double-digit percentage gains on reports it received an offer from Couche-Tard and with Westpac finding some relief from the AUSTRAC-related losses after its CEO stepped down and Chairman announced an early retirement, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) is lifted by a weaker currency and with M&amp;A also in focus as Hitachi Chemicals surge on a potential takeover by Showa Denko. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were initially positive on the recent trade optimism although the gains were later reversed after another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC and as Alibaba’s debut threatens to shun the regional darlings, while a brief spike in risk appetite attributed to algos reacting to news US and China trade negotiators held a phone call and reached a consensus on solving issues, later faded given the lack of fresh solid developments.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and consolidates following yesterday’s choppy price action and with overnight comments from Fed Chair Powell not providing much to spur prices in which he reiterated the Fed will respond accordingly if developments cause a material reassessment of the economic outlook and that current monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as economic data is consistent with moderate growth. The greenback’s major counterparts are also uneventful with EUR/USD languishing just north of the 1.1000 level and with GBP/USD kept rangebound near 1.2900 after conflicting projections in which the latest ICM poll just showed a 7-point lead for the Conservatives which is a far cry from the 19-point gap suggested by the recent Opinium survey. Elsewhere, USD/JPY reclaimed the 109.00 handle on the improved risk appetite and with the gains momentarily exacerbated by the phone call between US and China trade negotiators, although this too was faded alongside the retracement in stocks, while antipodeans conform to the humdrum picture seen in the currency space with NZD/USD only briefly supported by better than expected New Zealand Retail Sales data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices subdued by the lack of safe-haven demand and with participants sidelined ahead of today’s 40yr auction.</p>",
