Equity bourses moved higher throughout the session continuing their fresh ATH streak, lending a hand to the energy complex, which also made solid gains going into the weekend. Havens fared worse, with XAU losing ~5 bucks, JPY and CHF down against the greenback and the TPLEX subdued. US Commerce Secretary Ross gave some more balanced comments, suggesting Trump is yet to decide whether or not to roll back the December 15th tariffs, nonetheless, the dial didn't change. In the US, retail sales figures held up okay, with the headline beating expectations, rebounding +0.3%, whilst a weaker industrial output report continued to echo the manufacturing slump seen globally. Cyclical sectors lead gains in equity markets, although the usually defensive health-care sector finished victor amid Trump announcing healthcare transparency plans.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>Overnight, NEC Director Kudlow set the positive tone noting that US and China are are on the short strokes of a phase 1 deal. Kudlow also noted that talks have been very constructive. Earlier reports in the WSJ, however, noted that a deal was near, although President Trump is not ready to sign off. Further positivity was spurred by Commerce Secretary Ross, who was mostly upbeat on the prospect of the two sides reaching a deal, noting we are much further along with the details of a trade deal and deal will be made in all likelihood, he said, adding that further calls will take place today. Ross however did state US President Trump had not yet indicated any change on the December 15th tariffs so far, although he did caveat it with that there is still plenty of time. The Commerce Secretary repeated Trump’s line that if there is no basis for a deal, there will be no tariff rollback. On Ags., Ross stated the question is whether or not China will commit to USD 40-50bln worth of purchases, and whether or not China can find an “escape route”. US President Trump has been pushing for China to agree to buy up to USD 50bln worth of agricultural goods as part of any Phase 1 deal, although SCMP citing industry insiders today noted that due to “market shifts” this request is “not really possible” in practice. Ross was critical of Huawei, saying the company should not be involved in the running of 5G network’s in the US. When asked why some waivers have been given to US companies to continue work with Huawei, Ross said they were to help maintain regional 3G and 4G networks.</p><p><strong>* EU AUTO TARIFFS: </strong>A Norwegian official said that from what he understands, following conversations with US Commerce Secretary Ross, the EU auto tariff decision has been delayed, Norwegian press reported. There has been no such statement so far officially from the US, but earlier in the week it was suggested via sources that a delay was highly likely. If true, this would clear one of the clouds dimming sentiment.</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES (OCT.): </strong>Headline M/M ticked up to 0.3% from a prior decline of 0.3%, whilst beating expectations for a 0.2% rise. Core retail sales however picked up to 0.2% from -0.1%, although missed expectations for a 0.4% rise. Retail Control, a contributor for GDP, matched expectations of a 0.3% rise from the prior previous flat reading, thus providing an overall mixed report for retail sales. Capital Economics highlight that the headline 0.3% rise alludes that consumption growth is still only gradually slowing, with the metric boosted by a 1.1% increase in gasoline sales after the price rebound from the prior month. Auto sales rose 0.5% in October, with CapEco suggesting it is a price related move citing a fall in unit sales from manufacturers. The desk notes the 0.3% control reading pushed the 3m/3m annualised growth rate from 6.3% to 4%, an eight-month low, although highlighting this figure is still reasonable, and is not a huge surprise given a slowdown in employment in the last year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US NY FED MANUFACTURYING: </strong>The<strong> </strong>index fell to 2.9 in November, slightly lower than the 4.0 reading in November and below Street expectations for 5.0. “The pre-trade war relationship between the Empire State and the ISM points to the latter rising to about 53 from 48.3” notes Pantheon. However, and despite the dip in November, the index has been outperforming the national ISM index of late, which, the consultancy argues, is largely due to New York States’ lower exposure to the trade war than most of the rest of the country. They conclude that “the chance of that (a rise in the national ISM to 53 from 48.3) happening anytime soon is slim”.</p><p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION (OCT.): </strong>The headline<strong> </strong>fell at a rate of 0.8% M/M, steeper than the -0.4% expected. The -0.8% fall was biggest decline in output since May 2009. The prior was revised slightly higher to -0.3% from -0.4%. Pantheon note industrial production was predominantly hit by a 2.6% drop in utility output as a result of weather-related incidents, as well as a 0.7% decline in mining, which weighed on the headline due a fall in coal production. Manufacturing production declined by 0.6% from a prior -0.5% as expected. However, the consultancy notes October’s GM Strike crushed this print as the strike led to motor vehicle output falling 7.1% M/M. Pantheon note it “continues to outperform relative to the ISM manufacturing survey”. Noting the outperformance may persist, but “history says it is unwise to assume that; non-auto output could easily fall sharply over the next few months.” The desk concludes with total manufacturing output will rebound heavily in November, although the next quarter looks even to see a third decline out of the last four months.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Kaplan (Neutral, 2020 voter) said capex spending is virtually paused because of trade uncertainty and that closing trade deals could lead to 2% GDP growth. He added that the USMCA will be very helpful to US and Mexico, and he is confident that it will pass within 6-months. On current Fed policy, he said the current setting is appropriate.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.95 HIGHER AT USD 57.72/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 1.02 HIGHER AT USD 63.30/BBL. </strong>Crude markets are solidly firmer on Friday, as sentiment took a turn for the better in the US trading session, with participants likely book squaring heading into the weekend, in addition to option expiry on WTI Z9 contracts. The complex has been relatively rangebound over the last two weeks, caught between the upwards pressures of progress in US/China trade talks and the downwards pressures of consecutive bearish EIA Inventory reports. WTI Dec’ 19 futures closed out the week towards the upper end of its approximate USD 56.00–58.00/bbl range, while Brent was a touch perkier, making a new two week high at USD 63.50/bbl. In terms of crude specific news; in its monthly oil report, the IEA maintained its forecast for oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020, at 1mln BPD and 1.2mln BPD respectively. Moreover, the report highlighted that Global oil supply rose 1.5mln BPD in October as Saudi Arabian production returned to normal and on increases from Norway, Canada and the US. Meanwhile, OPEC crude oil production was 29.9mln BPD at 101mln BPD, with world oil supply was 1.2mln BPD below year-ago levels with OPEC down 2.5mln BPD. As a reminder, yesterday OPEC also maintained its forecast for global oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020 at 980k BPD for 2019 and 1.08mln BPD for 2020. Moreover, earlier in the week, the US EIA cut its forecast for 2019 oil demand growth 90k BPD to a 750k BPD increase but raised its 2020 forecast by 70k BPD to an increase of 1.37mln BPD. The Baker Hughes US rig count printed oil rigs -10 at 674, nat gas rigs -1 at 129 and total rigs -11 at 817.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 129.04+. </strong>The TPLEX traded with mild losses to end the week, with the usual risk driver of positive US-China trade sentiment weighing on havens; yields were higher across the curve by approximately 2bps at settlement. On the week, yields have come off their recent highs, with the 10-year yield currently around 1.83%, compared to the 1.97% reached last week, where the yield rally has taken a breather this week, in addition to some more cautious trade updates providing some resistance to selling pressures. The slate of Fed speak has shown unanimous content with current policy and an FOMC on pause as it waits to see how the economy reacts to recent cuts; the 2s10s has narrowed from just shy of 27bps to 22bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.8% at 3120, NASDAQ-100 0.7% at 8316, Dow Jones 0.8% at 28005,</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, Consumer Staples 0.1%, Energy 0.7%, Financials 0.5%, Health Care 2.2%, Industrials 0.7%, Information Technology 0.8%, Materials -0.1%, Telecommunication Services 0.7%, Utilities 0.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Healthcare stocks (HUM, UNH, CNC, ANTM) caught a bid in the afternoon as Trump formally announced the administration’s new healthcare price transparency plans, giving states the option to purchase drugs abroad also. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) legged higher amid Warren Buffet taking a new stake in the name; RH (RH) also surged following Buffett taking a new stake. Danaher (DHR) caught a bid as it announced its exchange offering plan for its divestment of Envista (NVST). Qualcomm (QCOM) and Baker Hughes (BKR) were on the front foot following upgrades at Mizuho and Susquehanna, whilst GrubHub (GRUB) found some reprieve after a double upgrade at Barclays on potential for a sale. CenterPoint Energy (CNP) took a hit after receiving less favourable terms than expected in a Texas Electric case, with several research houses downgrading the name. Lyft (LYFT) benefitted from a Top Pick mention at JPMorgan. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was supported from a PT rise at RBC. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) was supported from an Oklahoma judge announcing it would be decreasing the fine it owes the state in the opioid case. T-Mobile (TMUS) saw some volatility on sources reports denying that CEO John Legere would be leaving the co.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Nvidia (NVDA) posted a stronger than expected Q3 but disappointed on its revenue forecast, with the stock lower on the day. Conversely, Applied Materials (AMAT) beat estimates for the quarter and guidance making strong gains. Chinese retailer JD.com (JD) beat top and bottom lines estimates and opened higher, although did fade throughout the day. Dolby Laboratories (DLB) also beat top and bottom whilst forecasting a strong FY EPS figure, seeing the stock trade firmer.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> A plethora of weak to mixed US data saw <strong>USD</strong> soften on Friday, although a stronger <strong>GBP </strong>also contributed to its decline. GBP broke above the 1.29 handle as the Brexit Party reportedly pulled a further 43 candidates, which seemingly further increases the probability of the market friendly Conservative Party winning a majority in the upcoming general election. <strong>EUR</strong> flirted just above the 1.10 handle overnight. Positive comments from White House Economic Advisor Kudlow led to strength in the <strong>CNH </strong>overnight pushing USDCNH to trade ~7.00 handle throughout the rest of the session. A friendly risk tone helped support the <strong>AUD &amp; NZD </strong>whilst hampering havens <strong>JPY,</strong> <strong>CHF</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong>. Meanwhile, <strong>CAD</strong> was mainly a function of oil prices. For a full recap of this week FX action, please <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/weekly-fx-wrap-aussie-misses-kiwi-surprises-trade-turbulent-and-trump-disappoints-15-11-2019\">click here.</a></p><p><strong>* UK POLITICS: </strong>Following yesterday’s deadline for<strong> </strong>UK political parties to put forward candidates, it emerged that the Brexit Party had stood down 43 candidates in constituencies not currently held by the Conservative Party. Reportedly, in 17 of these 43 seats, the Conservative Party had come second in 2017. Earlier in the week, Brexit Party Leader Farage announced that his party would not contest the 317 seats currently held by the Conservatives, meaning that when combined with an extra 43 seats, the Brexit Party will not be contesting 360 seats. For reference, 326 seats are needed for a majority, so the Conservatives are 9 seats away; when taking into account the fact that of the 43 seats not currently held by the Conservatives, they came second in 17, closing this gap seems highly feasible. The market appeared to interpret the news as further increasing the chances of a Conservative Majority, as Cable swiftly advanced to session highs. Elsewhere, the incoming EU Council President Michel announced the EU is ready to negotiate with the UK, but declined to predict how long a trade deal between the EU &amp; UK would take.</p>",

The complex has been relatively rangebound over the last two weeks, caught between the upwards pressures of progress in US/China trade talks and the downwards pressures of consecutive bearish EIA Inventory reports. WTI Dec’ 19 futures closed out the week towards the upper end of its approximate USD 56.00–58.00/bbl range, while Brent was a touch perkier, making a new two week high at USD 63.50/bbl. In terms of crude specific news; in its monthly oil report, the IEA maintained its forecast for oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020, at 1mln BPD and 1.2mln BPD respectively. Moreover, the report highlighted that Global oil supply rose 1.5mln BPD in October as Saudi Arabian production returned to normal and on increases from Norway, Canada and the US. Meanwhile, OPEC crude oil production was 29.9mln BPD at 101mln BPD, with world oil supply was 1.2mln BPD below year-ago levels with OPEC down 2.5mln BPD. As a reminder, yesterday OPEC also maintained its forecast for global oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020 at 980k BPD for 2019 and 1.08mln BPD for 2020. Moreover, earlier in the week, the US EIA cut its forecast for 2019 oil demand growth 90k BPD to a 750k BPD increase but raised its 2020 forecast by 70k BPD to an increase of 1.37mln BPD. The Baker Hughes US rig count printed oil rigs -10 at 674, nat gas rigs -1 at 129 and total rigs -11 at 817.</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Aussie misses, Kiwi surprises, trade turbulent and Trump disappoints",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>A softer week for the broad Dollar and index with little clarity on Phase One of the US-China trade saga with rhetoric form US officials varying from sources reports that talks hit road-bumps. Nevertheless, the Buck has been more undermined by State-side data with disappointing IP figures pressuring the Index to test 98.000 to the downside, however earlier in the week, CPI data topped estimates, albeit mainly due to residual tariff effects and boost from gasoline prices. Speaker-wise, US President Trump failed to provide much by way of new substance on trade talks, whilst Fed Chair Powell largely stuck to the Fed’s mantra, reiterated October policy guidance and the shift to pause with optionality to react if needed. DXY looks set to end the week around the bottom of this week’s 98.00-45 range, (having eclipsed last week’s high earlier this week) with the index’s 100 DMA also residing just below the round figure. Meanwhile, trade-related to-and-fro developments/headlines sees the CNH modestly weaker heading into Friday’s EU close as USD/CNH reclaimed 7.0000 to the upside to a weekly high of 7.0376 (vs. open 6.9870) ahead of next week’s PBoC Loan Prime Rate announcement (20th).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD</strong></p><p>The Antipodeans are poised to end the European week mixed with the Kiwi on the front foot after being bolstered by the RBNZ’s surprise hold on rates vs. forecasts for a 25bps cut and money markets pricing in an 80%+ chance of a reduction pre-decision. Further, Governor Orr noted that there is no urgent need for further stimulus since August’s double barrel cut, albeit the Governor last night stated that the door is open for a rate cut if needed and reiterated data-dependency. Meanwhile, Deputy Governor Hawkesby highlighted that a February rate decision is live but reassured that the outlook needs to first change heading into its decision. NZD/USD looks to end the week comfortably in the green having traded in a 0.63250-6420 weekly range and having climbed back above its 50 DMA (0.6345) post-RBNZ. Conversely, the Aussie has been the underperformer in the high-beta space amidst several factors throughout the week including dismal Aussie labour market data, downbeat China IP figures and downside from the AUD/NZD cross. Analysts note that this week’s Labour force data draws a question mark over Governor Lowe’s more encouraging assessment of the Australian economy, whilst money market pricing for a cut next month more than doubled to 30% post-data. AUD/USD looks set to finish European trade in the red and closer to the bottom of a 0.6770-6870 intraweek range and below its 50 and 100 DMAs (at 0.6816 and 0.6841 respectively). Meanwhile, the AUD/NZD posted hefty losses and looks to end the week almost 2% lower on the week after opening with a 1.08+ status and falling to a whisker away from the 1.06 level, having dropped below its 50 DMA (1.0740), 200 WMA (1.0703), 100 WMA (1.0690) and at one point dipping below its 100 DMA (1.0622).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Both set to end the EU session and week in the green with Sterling more-so on a firmer footing amid impetus after UK Brexit Party leader Farage announced that the party is to withdraw 317 contestants that would’ve contested seats won by the Conservative party at the last election, thus upping the chances for a Tory-led government - the more market-friendly outcome due to more Brexit certainty and less threat of a no-deal Brexit. The week also saw the release of UK GDP which modestly undermined the currency at the time, although the Farage-driven upside largely overshadowed the metric. Meanwhile, UK CPI YY fell to 1.5% from 1.7%, in-fitting with the BoE’s forecast and due to the lower energy price cap whilst retail sales also came in below expectations, again muted reactions as the currency observes developments in the political space. Cable heads into the end of the European week towards the top of its intra-week band (1.2787-2898) with the introduction of Markit’s Flash UK PMIs on next week’s docket. Elsewhere, the Single Currency has had a relatively tame week in comparison, although Germany managed to narrowly avoid a technical recession by 0.2ppts. EUR/USD held 1.10+ status throughout most of the week but briefly dipped below the round figure before rebounding off support at its weekly low of 1.0990 (vs high of 1.1043). Looking ahead, next week sees the release of EZ November Flash PMIs alongside a slew of ECB speakers and ECB minutes, with the latter unlikely to garner much attention given the humdrum October meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The major beneficiaries of this week’s trade-related disappointment amid talks hitting hurdles on ag purchases, IP provisions alongside tariff rollbacks, and with the safe-havens also underpinned by the ongoing social unrest in Hong Kong. However, verbal intervention from US officials on the US-China situations have seen the currencies off highs on a modest unwind in risk premia. USD/JPY still looks to end the EU week around the middle of this week’s range (108.24-109.30) having opened on a 109+ handle and above its 50 WMA (109.18). Similarly, the Franc posted gains on the week after declining below the 0.9900 mark vs. the Greenback despite SNB President Jordan highlighting the importance of NIRP (potentially deeper NIR if needed) and reiterated the high valuation of the CHF. USD/CHF fell below its 200 and 50 DMAs (0.9951 and 0.9923) throughout the week whilst also briefly dipping below its 100 DMA (0.9880) on trade-related headlines. Safe-haven traders will be eyeing next week’s scheduled risk events in the form of FOMC Minutes (Wed) and EZ flash PMIs (Fri) whilst also keeping an eye on US-China Phase One developments and the situation in Hong Kong after reports the government is to take “more decisive measures” to end the violence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEK</strong></p><p>Swedish data this week saw CPIF printing in-line with market expectations at 1.5%, but below the 1.58% Riksbank forecast, although Board Members passed the figure as “basically in-line”. Subsequently, Thursday saw the release of the Labour data which was heavily revised due to collection errors; while these prints did not muster up much in the way of a reaction, the SEK has shrugged off mid-week weakness and has strengthened in-line with the trade rhetoric. In terms of magnitude EUR/SEK has printed a weekly range of 10.75 to 10.6450, and the SEK appears poised to end the week on a high note assuming the positive trade narrative doesn’t dissipate.&nbsp;</p>",

October's rise is likely to be driven by firmer gasoline prices, which is seen offsetting some of the weakness from a slowdown in retail sales in the month. &nbsp;</li><li>One potential source of risk appears to be from Black Friday, with some analysts noting that, at this time of year, sales could be be impacted by consumers waiting for Black Friday discounts. The Conference Board's gauge of consumer confidence in October was relatively flat after the fall in September; while the present situation index improved, expectations weakened slightly as consumers expressed some concerns about business conditions and job prospects. However, confidence levels remain high and there are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending, CB said.</li><li>With the Fed in data-dependent mode, the data may help to shape the narrative, given that the US consumer has been a key source of support for the US (and thus, global) economy, though it seems unlikely that an in line print will do much to alter probabilities for the December meeting. Fed Chair Powell this week reiterated his view that the outlook remains favourable, supported by household consumption, a healthy job market, rising incomes, and favorable levels of consumer confidence.</li></ul>",

(-0.6%)</strong> were mixed as Hong Kong attempted some composure from this week’s protest-triggered declines, although the mainland was somewhat unconvinced by the conflicting trade headlines, as well as the PBoC’s tepid actions in which it skipped reverse repos and instead opted for its medium-term lending facility, albeit at half the amount of the prior operation. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy as they initially extended above the 153.00 level although prices then reversed from intraday highs amid the positive risk tone and after a relatively light BoJ Rinban operation for just JPY 130bln in longer-dated JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations but announced to lend CNY 200bln through 1yr MLF at 3.25% vs. Prev.

Nonetheless, DXY remains contained within a tight band thus far (98.12-23), albeit closer to the top of the range and in anticipation of further clarification. The Yuan meanwhile has derived modest impetus on the back of Kudlow, which saw USD/CNH retest 7.000 to the downside overnight, but the pair has drifted off lows and almost back to pre-Kudlow levels with participants sceptical amid conflicting reports.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD - </strong>The high-beta currencies have unwound some of its Kudlow-induced APAC gains in which the Aussie climbed to a whisker away from 0.6800 vs. the Buck, whilst its Kiwi counterpart edged towards 0.6400 before fading gains. The antipodeans meander just below the respective round figures but have drifted lower in recent trade as the Buck prints fresh session highs and again the currencies await clarity on the status of US-Sino talks. The Loonie meanwhile saw a more pronounced move overnight amid the risk-driven pop higher in the crude complex in which USD/CAD tested 1.3220 to the downside (ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.3208) before advancing back up towards the half-figure in early European trade with around USD 1.2bln of options expiring between strikes 1.3240-50.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY – </strong>Despite the pull-back in high-betas, the overnight softness in the safe haven FX has persisted, although more-so as the Greenback gains traction in early trade with USD/JPY eclipsing its APAC high of 108.62 with the next level to the upside the round 109.00 which coincides with its 200 DMA.

Market drivers this morning have been scarce as focus remains on the constructive Kudlow remarks; for the German 10yr explicitly this resides towards the top of the day’s range but has not been able to successfully retain the 171.0 handle with 171.05 printed at best thus far, ahead of resistance at 171.15. Data wise, EZ CPI (Final) was largely unrevised and as such unable to spur any momentum. Elsewhere, after a busy week on the UK data front, Gilts are set to end the week slightly subdued given the broader risk theme, though downside may be capped by support at 131.36; 24 ticks below the current session low just under 131.60. Stateside, price action has the opportunity to become more lively with retail sales amongst the scheduled prints; on this, Lloyds are expecting a rebound from Septembers fall although, they do caveat that, retail sales for October can be negatively impacted by consumers awaiting the Black Friday sales event on the 29th of November. For reference, USTs are currently mirroring their European counterparts with the curve marginally steeper at present.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Crude markets are lower </strong>during early Friday trade after unwinding gains from the positive US/China trade comments from White House Economic Advisor Kudlow since the arrival of European participants as traders balance hot and cold trade news. Brent Jan’ 19 futures have now fallen below support in the form of yesterday’s USD 62.15/bbl low, with WTI Dec’ 19 futures following and also breaking below yesterday’s low at USD 56.64/bbl. In terms of crude specific news; in its monthly oil report, the IEA maintained its forecast for oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020, at 1mln BPD and 1.2mln BPD respectively. Moreover, the report highlighted that Global oil supply rose 1.5mln BPD in October as Saudi Arabian production returned to normal and on increases from Norway, Canada and the US. Meanwhile, OPEC crude oil production was 29.9mln BPD at 101 mln BPD, with world oil supply was 1.2 mb/d below year-ago levels with OPEC down 2.5 mln BPD. As a reminder, yesterday OPEC also maintained its forecast for global oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020 at at 980k BPD for 2019 and 1.08mln BPD for 2020. Earlier in the week, the US EIA cut its forecast for 2019 oil demand growth 90k BPD to a 750k BPD increase but raised its 2020 forecast by 70k BPD to an increase of 1.37mln BPD. Looking ahead, US Retail Sales, NY Fed Manufacturing, Industrial Production and Import Prices populate an otherwise modest data docket, while traders will as always have their ears to the ground for further US/China trade updates. In terms of the metals; <strong>Gold</strong> is on the back foot amid the market’s lukewarm risk tone and a stronger Dollar and is consolidating around the USD 1465/oz mark. Meanwhile, <strong>Copper,</strong> which has been on the back foot in recent days, appears to be have stabilised, with support at the USD 2.615/lbs level (23 October and yesterday’s lows) providing a floor for the time being.</p><p><strong>IEA Monthly Oil Report:</strong> <strong>maintains oil demand growth estimates for 2019 and 2020 at 1mln BPD and 1.2mln BPD respectively</strong></p><p>- Global oil supply rose 1.5mln BPD in October as Saudi Arabian production returned to normal and on increases from Norway, Canada and the US</p><p>- OPEC crude oil production was 29.9mln BPD At 101 mln BPD, world oil supply was 1.2 mb/d below year-ago levels with OPEC down 2.5 mln BPD.

        "content": "<p>A quiet end to the week for the debt complex thus far, as price action remains relatively rangebound and an early test of the 171.0 mark to the upside in Bunds failed to hold just after the European cash/equity open as the early trade induced risk-on feeling appeared poised to fade. Market drivers this morning have been scarce as focus remains on the constructive Kudlow remarks; for the German 10yr explicitly this resides towards the top of the day’s range but has not been able to successfully retain the 171.0 handle with 171.05 printed at best thus far, ahead of resistance at 171.15. Data wise, EZ CPI (Final) was largely unrevised and as such unable to spur any momentum. Elsewhere, after a busy week on the UK data front, Gilts are set to end the week slightly subdued given the broader risk theme, though downside may be capped by support at 131.36; 24 ticks below the current session low just under 131.60. Stateside, price action has the opportunity to become more lively with retail sales amongst the scheduled prints; on this, Lloyds are expecting a rebound from Septembers fall although, they do caveat that, retail sales for October can be negatively impacted by consumers awaiting the Black Friday sales event on the 29th of November. For reference, USTs are currently mirroring their European counterparts with the curve marginally steeper at present.</p>",

Nonetheless, DXY remains contained within a tight band thus far (98.12-23), albeit closer to the top of the range and in anticipation of further clarification. The Yuan meanwhile has derived modest impetus on the back of Kudlow, which saw USD/CNH retest 7.000 to the downside overnight, but the pair has drifted off lows and almost back to pre-Kudlow levels with participants sceptical amid conflicting reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AUD, NZD, CAD</p><p>The high-beta currencies have unwound some of its Kudlow-induced APAC gains in which the Aussie climbed to a whisker away from 0.6800 vs. the Buck, whilst its Kiwi counterpart edged towards 0.6400 before fading gains. The antipodeans meander just below the respective round figures but have drifted lower in recent trade as the Buck prints fresh session highs and again the currencies await clarity on the status of US-Sino talks. The Loonie meanwhile saw a more pronounced move overnight amid the risk-driven pop higher in the crude complex in which USD/CAD tested 1.3220 to the downside (ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.3208) before advancing back up towards the half-figure in early European trade with around USD 1.2bln of options expiring between strikes 1.3240-50.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHF, JPY</p><p>Despite the pull-back in high-betas, the overnight softness in the safe haven FX has persisted, although more-so as the Greenback gains traction in early trade with USD/JPY eclipsing its APAC high of 108.62 with the next level to the upside the round 109.00 which coincides with its 200 DMA. The Franc meanwhile has reclaimed 0.99+ status against the Buck and resides near the top of the range alongside its JPY counterpart with the next level to the upside its 50 DMA at 0.9923.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EUR, GBP</p><p>Sterling remains little moved on the day amid a lack of fresh catalysts on the UK election front and with little action derived by news that the European Commission has opened a legal case against the UK for failing to name a new EU Commissioner as its hands are tied by the general election. Cable remains modestly softer within a 1.2868-86 band, albeit closer to the bottom of the range and at the whim of the USD. Meanwhile, EUR/USD remains flat intraday and closer to the bottom of today’s 1.1030-15 band as in-line final EZ CPI figures unsurprisingly did little to excite traders. It’s worth noting a hefty EUR 1.2bln expiring at strike 1.1000 at today’s NY cut which may see a gravitation of price depending on news-flow.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as sentiment remains at the whim of the temperamental trade rhetoric with risk appetite spurred after White House Economic Adviser Kudlow suggested they are getting close to an agreement and the sides were on the short strokes of a phase 1 deal, and although Kudlow noted US President Trump is not yet ready to sign off, his comments were at a sharp contrast to earlier reports that the trade teams were struggling to complete an agreement. ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) are positive with Australia underpinned by the recent increase in rate cut bets after chances for a cut next month more than doubled to 29% according to ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures and with its implied yield curve heavily leaning towards a cut at the subsequent meeting in February, while a deluge of earnings has been a key driver in Japan alongside tailwinds from a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) conform to the gains with Hong Kong attempting some composure from this week’s protest-triggered declines, although the mainland is somewhat unconvinced by the conflicting trade headlines, as well as the PBoC’s tepid actions in which it skipped reverse repos and instead opted to lend through its medium-term lending facility, albeit at half the amount of the prior operation.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre after yesterday’s mild pullback and mixed data which showed Jobless Claims rose to its highest since June, with the greenback also subdued by a recent resurgence in its transatlantic counterparts. GBP/USD edges closer towards near-term resistance at 1.2900 where there is also a mid-size option expiry for today’s New York cut, and EUR/USD gently prods above the recently reclaimed 1.1000 level after Germany narrowly averted a technical recession. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are underpinned by the slight improved risk tone, while antipodeans are seeing a mild rebound with NZD/USD helped after New Zealand PMI data returned into expansion territory and although RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby suggested a February rate decision is live, he caveated that a rate cut in February would require a change to the outlook.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher after extending above the 153.00 level but with prices off their highs amid the positive risk tone and after a relatively light BoJ Rinban operation for just JPY 130bln in longer-dated JGBs.</p>",
