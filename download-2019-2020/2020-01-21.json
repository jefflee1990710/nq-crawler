And after news that the Cornavirus was diagnosed in the US, travel names came under pressure, including airlines such as DAL, AAL and LUV, and hotel companies such as MAR, HLT and H were also pressured; Biotech stocks saw upside. Selling pressure was exacerbated after reports that Boeing (BA) does not expect regulators to sign off 737 MAX until June or July, months later than originally expected. Meanwhile, Uber (UBER) made solid gains following the divestment of its food-delivery business in India. Intel (INTC) was positively mention with a PT rise at Jefferies. L Brands (LB) opened on the front foot after an upgrade at KeyBanc, citing growing expectations for a Victoria’s Secret spin-off. Morgan Stanley (MS) sold off with gratitude to a downgrade to neutral at Citi on valuation. Evergy (EVRG) was firmer on the back of Elliott taking interest in the deep-south focused utilities Co. Restaurant Brands (QSR) was mentioned as a “long term winner” at Deutsche Bank, seeing the stock outperform. In earnings, Halliburton (HAL) fared firmer on a top and bottom-line beat, whilst it cautioned of continued decline this year in North American activity. SPX -0.3% at 3321; Dow -0.5% at 29,196; NDX -0.1% at 9,167.</p><p>Treasuries rallied overnight as downside was seen in APAC equity bourses due to reports of Coronavirus in China, as well as the Moody’s downgrade of HK. There was some paring back of gains into the European session, and a lack of Tier-One US releases/speakers, but gains were extended after the CDC confirmed a case of the Coronavirus in the US. The heavy slate of corporate issuance did little to shake the complex either, with supply especially notable from financials after earnings have cleared. There was also some chunky USD issuance from Pemex (USD 5bln, 2-parter; books said to be around USD 25bln) as well as Saudi Arabia (USD 5bln, 3-parter, due Thursday). At settlement, the curve had bull-flattened, with yields down around 3.5bps in the front-end of the curve, and lower by over 6bps in the long-end. US T-note futures (H0) settle 17 ticks higher at 129-18+.</p>",

With the Lunar New Year set to begin on Friday, there is now a prospect that consumer spending and travel plans may be hit by the outbreak of the virus (the LNY is the biggest migration of humans, with three billion trips planned). The impact might also be seen regionally, with some suggesting that it has the potential to also weigh on Aussie tourism, for instance. Some traders had circulated a 2004 paper on SARS, which argued that it trimmed China growth in 2003 by between 1-2ppts.</p><p><strong>* US CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The<strong> </strong>Center for Disease Control later confirmed that a Chinese traveller had been diagnosed with the virus in Seattle, Washington State. The news contributed to downside for risk assets, though the reaction was comfortably contained within ranges. The CDC expects more cases in the US of the Wuhan coronavirus, notes the previous patient with the virus is in a good condition; risk to the public from the virus remains low in the US</p><p><strong>* US/EU TRADE: </strong>The US and France have reportedly struck a truce over French proposals for a 'digital tax' that would hit US tech companies; reports suggest both sides have agreed to avoid imposing tariffs on the other this year while talks continue. After US President Trump’s meeting with EC President von Der Leyen, the White House released a statement stating that the US expects tangible progress towards a US/EU trade deal “in the near future”. Trump added the two sides do expect to reach a deal, however the tariff threat has been left on the table, although he ordered the commerce dept. to withhold the report on national security impacts of imported auto goods from lawmakers, in worries it would interfere with current negotiations.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>Addressing Davos, US President Trump said that Phase Two talks with China will start \"very shortly\", although most analysts believe that anything before the US Presidential Elections in November seems ambitious. Speaking to the WSJ, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that with the Phase One China deal in place, Phase Two deal would not necessarily lead to a removal of all tariffs; it could be done sequentially along the way.</p><p><strong>* DAVOS:</strong> In his address at Davos, US President Trump reiterated his view that the US is in the midst of an economic boom, and that the Fed raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly. Trump. The US President also spoke of US energy independence, reiterating familiar lines.</p><p><strong>* UK LABOUR MARKET (NOV/DEC):</strong> 208k jobs were added to the UK economy in November, topping the 110k consensus, and rising from a prior 24k; the jobless rate was unchanged at 3.8%. The claimant count was 14.9k in December, against a consensus 22.6k. Capital Economics said the data suggests that the labour market is not getting worse, and in fact, may have even started to turn around, which may convince the MPC to hold off cutting rates at its meeting next week. The probability of a 25bps rate cut fell after the data, sitting at around 62% from a peak of around 72% last week. Pay growth remained at 3.2% Y/Y in November, and the ex-bonus measure fell by one-tenth to 3.4% Y/Y. CapEco notes that the MPC has said that it is giving more weight than normal to the condition of the labour market to help it determine how much slack there is in the economy. \"As such, the rebound in employment and slightly softer pay growth will give the MPC another reason not to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.50% at their next meeting on 30th January. However, we think that the crucial piece of information for the MPC will be the flash PMIs on 24th January, which will confirm, or refute, any 'Boris bounce' in the economy.\"</p><p><strong>* GERMANY ZEW (JAN):</strong> Economic Sentiment rose to 26.7 in January (consensus 15.0, previous 10.7), while Current Conditions pared to -9.5 from -19.9 (consensus -13.5). Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the upside was not that surprising, given markets are performing well, and policymakers are committed to supporting the economy. \"This glass-half full look at the world is clearly visible by the widening positive spread between rising expectations and a still-subdued current situation gauge—rising to -9.5 in January from -19.9 in December — which is usually a bullish signal from this indicator,\" Pantheon writes. The consultancy also notes that analysts' inflation expectations are now rising slightly, across most major EZ and global economies, a shift that carries over into rising short-term interest rate expectations.</p><p><strong>* ECB BANK LENDING SURVEY:</strong> Ahead of the ECB confab on Thursday, the central bank's latest bank lending survey showed credit conditions were roughly unchanged in Q4, but lending demand from businesses was declining. ING said the main takeaway from the ECB bank lending survey is that banks confirm a lower appetite for lending among non-financial corporates. \"Loan growth to non-financial corporates had already slowed throughout Q4, which indicates that investment growth is set to remain sluggish even though loose financial conditions are still in place in the Eurozone,\" and \"financial conditions remained about as loose in Q4 as they were in the previous quarter.\" The bank says uncertainty about economic conditions has somewhat ebbed over the past months though as the 'phase one' trade deal between China and the US provides hope for world trade growth recovery. \"While it is early days and there's still plenty of uncertainty, this could have a somewhat favourable impact on demand, not least because banks also expect credit conditions to remain unchanged in the first quarter.\" Meanwhile, ING observes that households were less cautious in Q4; \"Spending growth has been decent and the demand for lending confirms that picture,\" and \"demand for both consumer credit and housing loans continued to increase in Q4, which is likely to continue to fuel the housing market and consumer spending at the start of this year.\" ING concludes that, overall, the survey confirms a picture of a continuing divide between services and industrial performance for the start of 2020.</p><p><strong>* CANADA MANUFACTURING SALES (NOV):</strong> Fell 0.6% M/M, deeper than the consensus -0.2%, although the previous was revised a touch higher to -0.2% from -0.7% stated initially. Canadian bank RBC said the downside was driven by the rail strike in some sectors, although auto parts rebounded after US labour disruptions. “It's hard to get a clean read on how the manufacturing sector fared in November,” RBC writes, “a rail strike reportedly held back shipments in some sectors. Statistics Canada pointed specifically to a big drop in primary metal shipments which shaved 0.8 ppts off headline volumes in the month. But a rebound in the transportation sector following earlier labour disruptions in the US—an increase that likely won't be repeated—provided some positive offset.” The bank says that transitory factors aside, H2 2019 was not kind to Canadian manufacturers. “What looked like the sector's resilience in early-2019—while factory output in other countries declined—clearly faded as the year wore on. And the near-term outlook is mixed,” adding that “external trade headwinds appear to be easing, but a survey of purchasing managers points to muted growth in the sector heading into 2020, an inventory overhang needs to be worked off, and the closure of GM's Oshawa plant will permanently reduce motor vehicle output.”</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW:</strong> The BoC is expected to stand pat on rates, holding its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.75%. The MPR report is expected to feature growth downgrades. The tone of policymakers is likely to be cautious. Rate decision due 1500 GMT/1000 ET on 22nd January; press conference to commence at 1615 GMT/1115 ET. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23678/download\">Full preview can be found here</a>.</p><p><strong>* BOJ REVIEW:</strong> As expected, the BOJ kept policy settings unchanged (rates held at -0.1%, the 10-year JGB yield target held at around 0.0%), and maintained its assessment of the economy, and reiterated that it would not hesitate to take additional easing measures if needed. It did, however, revise growth forecasts upwards for the first time in over a year, on account of fiscal stimulus measures, though cut its inflation view again across its forecast horizon. \"The BOJ’s latest inaction came on the back of a record budget for fiscal year 2020 and a fiscal 2019 supplementary budget bill while the BOJ also had a somewhat improved outlook for the risks from overseas impacting Japan’s economy,\" UOB's analysts write, \"however, the threat from overseas remains persistent and the outlook for Japan’s price outlook is still dismal and that BOJ’s continued forward guidance without action will not be sufficient.\" UOB adds that with the economic data turning south even with the temporary relief from the fiscal stimulus, the BOJ will eventually need to act -- the question is when and how will the BOJ ease its already very easy monetary policy.\" UOB expects the central bank to renew easing monetary policy via deepening its negative policy call rate to -0.2%, possibly at the March MPM, and also says that other measures may follow if the domestic economic situation turns down further in 2020.</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA:</strong> While markets believe that geopolitical tensions are tempering, it’s worth keeping stock of those simmering in the background; further punchy language came from North Korean officials today, which stated that if the US persisted in a hostile policy towards the nation, then it will never see denuclearisation. NK also accused the US of applying \"the most brutal and inhuman sanctions\". Analysts say North Korea wants US sanctions relief, and for the US to review its partnership with South Korea, where the two engage in military exercises – something the North says destabilises the region and is a threat to the North. Analysts have also noted that the pariah nation has reportedly put in place a new Foreign Minister, who as a military background, potentially signalling a more hard-line approach out of North Korea. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-north-korean-tensions-brew-in-the-background-21-01-2020\">Full analysis here</a>.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) settles 0.20 lower at USD 58.38; Brent (H0) settles USD 0.61 lower at USD 64.59:</strong> Brent opened lower, trading under the USD 65/bbl handle, having touched USD 66.00 on Monday after Libya declared a force majeure on loadings from El Sharara and El Feel; desks are becoming comfortable with the notion that production will resume soon. The impact on oil prices has clearly been short-lived (a situation that may change in a scenario of more prolonged outage, which has the potential to slash Libyan production to under 100k BPD, from around 1.2mln BPD); IEA chief Birol has also suggested that the disruption should not be a major challenge, and sees a 1mln BPD oil market surplus in the first half of 2020. Traders have also been focussing on a report from analysts at Wood Mackenzie, which has argued that China will struggle to meet its Phase One deal pledge to lift purchases of US crude from around 400k BPD to 1.1mln BPD in 2020/21. UBS noted that \"there are already concerns about the potential difficulty of progressing to a Phase Two deal, with a number of contentious issues yet to be resolved, so risks to the existing agreement will weigh on the oil price\". Elsewhere, Saudi Energy Minister stated Russia Russia is not contemplating quitting the OPEC + deal in March, whilst highlighting the importance of the March meeting to review the current deal. The latest EIA forecast sees total shale regions oil production +22k BPD in February at 9.2mln BPD.</p><p>*<strong> US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE 17 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-18+. </strong>Treasuries rallied overnight as downside was seen in APAC equity bourses due to reports of Coronavirus in China, as well as the Moody’s downgrade of HK. There was some paring back of gains into the European session, and a lack of Tier-One US releases/speakers, but gains were extended after the CDC confirmed a case of the Coronavirus in the US. The heavy slate of corporate issuance did little to shake the complex either, with supply especially notable from financials after earnings have cleared. There was also some chunky USD issuance from Pemex (USD 5bln, 2-parter; books said to be around USD 25bln) as well as Saudi Arabia (USD 5bln, 3-parter, due Thursday). At settlement, the curve had bull-flattened, with yields down around 3.5bps in the front-end of the curve, and lower by over 6bps in the long-end.</p><p><strong>* STOCK CLOSES: SPX -0.3% at 3321; Dow -0.5% at 29,196; NDX -0.1% at 9,167; </strong>SECTORS: communications -0.1%, consumer discretionary -0.2%, consumer staples +0.3%, energy -1.8%, financials -0.9%, health care +0.1%, industrials -1.1%, IT -0.1%, materials -1.1%, telecoms -0.1%.</p><p><strong>* US STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> As concern grew on the Asian coronavirus, holiday-related stocks underperformed, namely casinos/resorts (WYNN, LVS, MGM, MLCO), cruise-liners (CCL, NCLH), airlines (UAL, DAL, AAL), Chinese ADRs (BABA, BIDU, JD, WB) and travel stocks (TCOM, BKNG, TRIP). And after news that the Cornavirus was diagnosed in the US, travel names came under pressure, including airlines such as DAL, AAL and LUV, and hotel companies such as MAR, HLT and H were also pressured; Biotech stocks saw upside. Selling pressure was exacerbated after reports that Boeing (BA) does not expect regulators to sign off 737 MAX until June or July, months later than originally expected. Meanwhile, Uber (UBER) made solid gains following the divestment of its food-delivery business in India. Intel (INTC) was positively mention with a PT rise at Jefferies. L Brands (LB) opened on the front foot after an upgrade at KeyBanc, citing growing expectations for a Victoria’s Secret spin-off. Morgan Stanley (MS) sold off with gratitude to a downgrade to neutral at Citi on valuation. Evergy (EVRG) was firmer on the back of Elliott taking interest in the deep-south focused utilities Co. Restaurant Brands (QSR) was mentioned as a “long term winner” at Deutsche Bank, seeing the stock outperform. In earnings, Halliburton (HAL) fared firmer on a top and bottom-line beat, whilst it cautioned of continued decline this year in North American activity.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Has held above 1.30 after stronger than expected labour market data marginally diminished the prospect of a BOE cut next week. (See UK labour market data analysis above). GBP topped out around 1.3083, though returned back towards the 1.3050 zone, coinciding with the 10-w/dmas around that area.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The yen strengthened, with USDJPY falling sub 110, more as a function of risk-off trading, rather than the BOJ non-event. However, even as the risk tone improved through European/North American trade, the JPY remained firm, perhaps due to the bid also remaining in the Treasury complex, with the curve bull-flattening as cash markets returned after the MLK holiday. News of the Coronavirus in the US also gave the yen further support.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> After its recent run is in wake of the US/China 'Phase One' trade deal signing, the yuan's profit-taking will not have surprised many after the outbreak of coronavirus, which comes ahead of the Lunar New Year (Friday) -- desks have suggested that the outbreak might hit consumer spending and holiday plans, while also impact travel and tourism across the region. \"A retreat in the yuan was always more likely than not after the holiday but it is probably too early to conclude that the currency has already peaked for this year if the economy carries over positive momentum from late 2019,\" SocGen's analysts said.</p><p><strong>* MXN:</strong> jobs data showed the unemployment rate falling to 2.9% against the expected 3.4%; the seasonally adjusted rate fell to 3.1% from 3.5%. Nevertheless, analysts warn about over interpreting the data, given the deterioration of the economy in H2 2018, and the fact that leading indicators do not augur well. Focus falls onto the bi-weekly inflation data, due Thursday. From a technical perspective, the MXN weakened again – yesterday the currency fell to 18.70, the lowest since October 2018, and the currency is hovering just above that level.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> Attention will be on the release of CPI data on Weds... some desks expect ZAR longs to be liquidated on an above-consensus print. Technicians note 200dma at 14.5995, with a break opening the door to 14.67/70, then 14.88 and 15.20. On the other side of the coin, downside will focus on the 13.91 January low.</p>",

The heavy slate of corporate issuance did little to shake the complex either, with supply especially notable from financials after earnings have cleared. There was also some chunky USD issuance from Pemex (USD 5bln, 2-parter; books said to be around USD 25bln) as well as Saudi Arabia (USD 5bln, 3-parter, due Thursday).

The impact on oil prices has clearly been short-lived (a situation that may change in a scenario of more prolonged outage, which has the potential to slash Libyan production to under 100k BPD, from around 1.2mln BPD); IEA chief Birol has also suggested that the disruption should not be a major challenge, and sees a 1mln BPD oil market surplus in the first half of 2020. Traders have also been focussing on a report from analysts at Wood Mackenzie, which has argued that China will struggle to meet its Phase One deal pledge to lift purchases of US crude from around 400k BPD to 1.1mln BPD in 2020/21. UBS noted that \"there are already concerns about the potential difficulty of progressing to a Phase Two deal, with a number of contentious issues yet to be resolved, so risks to the existing agreement will weigh on the oil price\". Elsewhere, Saudi Energy Minister stated Russia Russia is not contemplating quitting the OPEC + deal in March, whilst highlighting the importance of the March meeting to review the current deal. The latest EIA forecast sees total shale regions oil production +22k BPD in February at 9.2mln BPD.&nbsp;</p>",

Although all or nearly all pre-GE, the data broke a run of downbeat indicators to spark a rebound in Cable to 1.3080+ at best, or more precisely bang on key resistance at 1.3083 (Fib retracement) and retreat in Eur/Gbp to sub-0.8500.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The other major winner, albeit just off best levels due to the partial and selective recovery in risk appetite, as Usd/Jpy straddles 110.00 within a 109.88-110.21 in wake of January’s BoJ policy meeting that delivered little new aside from upward GDP forecast tweaks that were largely countered by trimmed CPI projections.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/EUR/CAD/AUD/NOK</strong></p><p>It’s a long shot, but the Kiwi may have gleaned some contraction from the rise in GDT auction prices, though more likely favourable tailwinds as Aud/Nzd probed a bit deeper below 1.0400 and Aud/Usd languished just above key technical support (100 DMA at 0.6844) due to contagion from the aforementioned Chinese outbreak and caution ahead of Aussie jobs data on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Euro lost momentum following an encouraging ZEW survey and failed to sustain 1.1100+ gains, but the Loonie managed to contain losses between 1.3044-77 after much weaker than anticipated Canadian manufacturing sales as the previous month’s heftier decline was revised up markedly. Elsewhere, the Franc also stuck to a tight line around 0.9675, but the Norwegian Crown slipped through 9.9500 against the single currency ahead of this week’s Norges Bank policy meeting.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes as the CE3 advanced vs the Euro but other regional currencies accumulated more losses against the Buck, as political and fiscal jitters plagued the Rouble along with a downturn in Brent, while the Lira had bearish comments from Turkey’s Finance Minister to contend with, like the Real for that matter, on top of ongoing geopolitical concerns. However, the Rand rebounded from worst levels despite more evidence of SAA’s cash problems via various cancelled flights perhaps on chart grounds as the 200 DMA (14.6000) was tested, but ultimately respected.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*Punchy Rhetoric</strong>: While markets believe that geopolitical tensions are tempering, it’s worth keeping stock of those simmering in the background; further punchy language came out of North Korea today, which stated that if the US persists in a hostile policy towards North Korea - the region will never see denuclearisation, whilst accusing the US of applying \"the most brutal and inhuman sanctions\". In this context, NK news outlets overnight renewed calls for citizens to step up efforts of self-reliance, warning of prolonged life under sanctions. The outlet, cited by Yonhap, also referred to the current situation with the US as “a fierce battle” - \"Our enemies are making a frantic last-ditch effort to rip us of everything precious to us,\" the paper said. North Korean leader Kim, at the start of the year, stated that he has no expectations of the US lifting sanctions soon.</p><p><strong>*Fresh Face: </strong>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sacked his foreign minister and top diplomat Ri Yong Ho, who is to be replaced by Ri Son Gwon, according to unconfirmed local reports – which analysts say could prompt a tougher stance from North Korea regarding denuclearisation talks with the US. The NK outlet said the reshuffle would likely be confirmed on or before Thursday. Analysts at Stratfor also believe that the move could amount to a more confrontational stance from NK as opposed to a diplomatic one: - “The incoming foreign minister was a key player in North Korea's 2018 outreach to South Korea, which will be a key focus for Pyongyang as it attempts to exploit differences in the U.S.-South Korean alliance over how to approach North Korea”, Stratfor says.</p><p><strong>*US Stance: </strong>US<strong> </strong>has continued to pursue a more diplomatic route regarding North Korean relations. US President Trump said he does not believe North Korean Leader Kim would break his word, after North Korea's official newspaper warned of \"immediate and powerful\" strikes against threats. White House National Security Adviser O'Brien noted last week that the Trump administration has reached out to North Korea to ask them to resume dialogue; while there were separate reports over that same weekend from North Korea that the country will not trade its nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>N.B. some market participants also noted that the US could ramp up military cooperation and drills with South Korea as a show of force in the hope it will act as a deterrent and keep North Korea in-line.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.8%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

UK’s FTSE 100 (-1.2%) lags its peers amid unfavourable currency effects induced by the UK Labour Market Report. Meanwhile, the SMI’s losses are somewhat cushioned by earnings from Lonza (+4.0%) – providing some support to the Swiss healthcare names which in total accounts for 37.5% of the index. Sectors are all in the red with defensives lower to a lesser extent when compared to cyclicals. Consumer discretionary names are hit on the back of dampening demand expectations on the back of the China virus outbreak, with LVMH (-2.7%), Kering (-3.7%), Swatch (-2.5%) and Richemont (-3.4%) among the worst hit. In terms of other individual movers, UBS (-5.0%) shares fell despite topping net expectations and announcing a share buyback alongside a sale of its stake in UBS Fondcenter – amid lower 2022 CET1– forecast at 12-15%, down from 2021’s 17%. On the flip side, Hugo Boss (+5.6%) shares rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 after earnings topped forecasts, with the company noting that FY19 targets were achieved.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/EUR/CHF - </strong>The Pound has regained some poise thanks to the latest UK jobs and earnings report that beat consensus almost across the board and came with a healthy revision to the previous claimant count in contrast to the recent run of sub-forecast/BoE rate cut supportive macro releases. Cable has reclaimed 1.3000+ status after flirting with 1.2955 early January lows only yesterday and Eur/Gbp is eyeing 0.8500 from 0.8550+ at one stage on Monday, even though the Euro has also gleaned some traction via an encouraging German/Eurozone ZEW survey to retest 1.1100 and offers above vs the Dollar. Meanwhile, the Yen is back in favour and over 110.00 after another dead rubber BoJ policy meeting as the YUAN pares more gains amidst the spread of China’s coronavirus that has claimed more lives and reached Australia, with safe-haven demand also returning to the Franc within a 0.9668-89 range.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD/NOK - </strong>All weaker against their US counterpart, and especially the Aussie given closer links to China and the reported case of the potentially fatal illness in Brisbane noted above. Aud/Usd has retreated further towards sub-0.6850 troughs not seen since mid-December (0.6849 and 0.6838) and is only just holding above the 100 DMA (0.6844) ahead of Thursday’s labour data that forms one of the last major inputs for the RBA next month. Similarly, the Loonie and Kiwi are trading defensively into Canadian manufacturing sales and the NZ GDT auction, with the latter also wary about Q4 CPI in 2 days time and its implications for the RBNZ in February. Usd/Cad is meandering between 1.3044-77, as Nzd/Usd straddles 0.6600 and Aud/Nzd slips back below 1.0400. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Crown is underperforming against the backdrop of receding oil prices and pre-Norges Bank caution in wake of a marked downturn in industrial sentiment, with Eur/Nok up above 9.9400 at the peak and through decent 9.9300 option expiry interest (680 mn).</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The DXY has drifted back down from MLK day peaks largely due to the aforementioned recoveries in G10 currency peers, like Sterling and the Euro on positive fundamentals and the Yen and Franc due to risk-off positioning/hedging.

UK’s FTSE 100 (-1.2%) lags its peers amid unfavourable currency effects induced by the UK Labour Market Report. Meanwhile, the SMI’s losses are somewhat cushioned by earnings from Lonza (+4.0%) – providing some support to the Swiss healthcare names which in total accounts for 37.5% of the index. Sectors are all in the red with defensives lower to a lesser extent when compared to cyclicals. Consumer discretionary names are hit on the back of dampening demand expectations on the back of the China virus outbreak, with LVMH (-2.7%), Kering (-3.7%), Swatch (-2.5%) and Richemont (-3.4%) among the worst hit. In terms of other individual movers, UBS (-5.0%) shares fell despite topping net expectations and announcing a share buyback alongside a sale of its stake in UBS Fondcenter – amid lower 2022 CET1– forecast at 12-15%, down from 2021’s 17%. On the flip side, Hugo Boss (+5.6%) shares rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 after earnings topped forecasts, with the company noting that FY19 targets were achieved.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP/JPY/EUR/CHF - The Pound has regained some poise thanks to the latest UK jobs and earnings report that beat consensus almost across the board and came with a healthy revision to the previous claimant count in contrast to the recent run of sub-forecast/BoE rate cut supportive macro releases. Cable has reclaimed 1.3000+ status after flirting with 1.2955 early January lows only yesterday and Eur/Gbp is eyeing 0.8500 from 0.8550+ at one stage on Monday, even though the Euro has also gleaned some traction via an encouraging German/Eurozone ZEW survey to retest 1.1100 and offers above vs the Dollar. Meanwhile, the Yen is back in favour and over 110.00 after another dead rubber BoJ policy meeting as the YUAN pares more gains amidst the spread of China’s coronavirus that has claimed more lives and reached Australia, with safe-haven demand also returning to the Franc within a 0.9668-89 range.</p><p>AUD/CAD/NZD/NOK - All weaker against their US counterpart, and especially the Aussie given closer links to China and the reported case of the potentially fatal illness in Brisbane noted above. Aud/Usd has retreated further towards sub-0.6850 troughs not seen since mid-December (0.6849 and 0.6838) and is only just holding above the 100 DMA (0.6844) ahead of Thursday’s labour data that forms one of the last major inputs for the RBA next month. Similarly, the Loonie and Kiwi are trading defensively into Canadian manufacturing sales and the NZ GDT auction, with the latter also wary about Q4 CPI in 2 days time and its implications for the RBNZ in February. Usd/Cad is meandering between 1.3044-77, as Nzd/Usd straddles 0.6600 and Aud/Nzd slips back below 1.0400. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Crown is underperforming against the backdrop of receding oil prices and pre-Norges Bank caution in wake of a marked downturn in industrial sentiment, with Eur/Nok up above 9.9400 at the peak and through decent 9.9300 option expiry interest (680 mn).</p><p>USD - The DXY has drifted back down from MLK day peaks largely due to the aforementioned recoveries in G10 currency peers, like Sterling and the Euro on positive fundamentals and the Yen and Franc due to risk-off positioning/hedging.

Risk aversion due to the Wuhan virus outbreak has fuelled the latest bounce in bonds, but Gilts and the 3 month strip are also benefiting from dovish BoE vibes that may be fuelled further if today’s labour market report defies consensus to the downside. However, long end DMO supply may need a concession and the first of BoE Governor Carney’s appearances at Davos is at 15GMT.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Given the recent slew of lacklustre data points from the UK (GDP, CPI, retail sales) and dovish tones from the BoE, today’s labour market data could be pivotal in assessing whether or not policymakers will opt to cut the bank rate by 25bps at the January meet. In terms of expectations, headline employment change is forecast to rise to 110k from 24k, headline earning growth is set to fall to 3.1% from 3.2% (ex-bonus Exp. 3.4% vs. Prev. 3.5%) and the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.8%. Note, the reason for the expected tick-up in employment is largely due to the -56k print in August dropping out of the 3M rolling average. Ahead of the release, RBC notes, that this will provide more of an insight into the state of the economy ahead of the December general election (potential hiring uncertainty), rather than how the UK is performing at the start of the year (postelection) and therefore, all things equal could have led participants to pay less attention to the release than they otherwise would have. However, given the aforementioned lacklustre hard data and dovish interventions from the BoE, the report will likely be used as another proxy in guiding market expectations over a potential BoE rate reduction this month. Dovish dissenter Saunders recently noted ““The economy still has a slow puncture and this seems to be spreading to the labour market”, therefore, a disappointing jobs report could help sway some voters on the MPC to lean in favour of his view point and move to the “cut” camp on the MPC</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> slipped below 110.00 and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were pressured as the broad risk averse tone triggered safe-haven flows, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> also traded subdued due to their high-beta characteristics which overshadowed the firmer reference rate setting by the PBoC.&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed with price action driven by the risk averse tone which pressured <strong>Brent</strong> and <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures overnight in which the former slipped below USD 65.00/bbl level, to extend on the prior day’s uninspiring trade due to the US market closure. Conversely, there were some optimistic comments on crude from Barclays which maintained crude <strong>Brent</strong> and <strong>WTI</strong> crude forecasts at USD 62/bbl and USD 57/bbl respectively for 2020, citing slim chances of a de-escalation in US-Iran tensions and anticipation of a pick-up in oil demand growth.

ASX 200 (-0.4%) pulled back from record highs amid broad sector weakness and with BHP pressured after quarterly iron ore production fell short of analyst estimates, while Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) retreated below 24k as Japanese exporters suffered from safe-haven flows into the domestic currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) are also negative with the former reeling after Moody’s downgraded Hong Kong’s sovereign rating by 1 notch to Aa3, and amid heightened concerns surrounding the ongoing coronavirus outbreak which has spread to more Chinese cities with 224 cases confirmed so far resulting to 4 deaths.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat within the prior day’s tight range owing to the MLK holiday and with attention in Washington turning to the start of the Trump impeachment trial at the Senate which begins later today, while the greenback’s transatlantic counterparts are indecisive as EUR/USD attempts a reclaim of the 1.1100 handle and with GBP/USD oscillating around 1.3000 amid warnings the EU will not agree to a FTA with the UK unless it signs up to “equivalence” in the way goods are produced in the UK and the EU. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped below 110.00 and JPY-crosses were pressured as the broad risk averse tone triggered safe-haven flows, while antipodeans are also subdued due to their high-beta characteristics which overshadowed the firmer reference rate setting by the PBoC.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher after breaking through the 152.00 level and as the risk averse tone spurred similar bids in T-notes, while attention now turns to the looming BoJ announcement.&nbsp;</p>",
