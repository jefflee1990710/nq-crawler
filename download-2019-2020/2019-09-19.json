However, it also noted that in the event of a period of further entrenched uncertainty over future UK-EU trading relationship, domestically generated inflationary pressures could be reduced as demand growth remains below potential, and maintained that the monetary policy response would not be automatic and could be in either direction in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>BoE judged that underlying growth has slowed but remains slightly positive, while it sees Q3 growth forecast at 0.2%.

The Fed accepted USD 75bln of the USD 83.875bln worth of bids received for its overnight repo operation. Another oversubscribed overnight repo implies continued stress and appears to allude to an ongoing liquidity shortage, which could be more than a short-term phenomenon; the Fed has announced a fourth consecutive overnight operation for Friday at the same time and terms of Thursday. The operations have not, as of yet, had a material impact further out the Treasury curve, but if the “temporary” operations become increasingly less temporary there is potential for the changing dynamics of short-term funding to work its way into longer maturities. Elsewhere, The US funding announcement for 2s, 5s, and 7s remained at an unchanged nominal amount. The Treasury also sold USD 12bln of 10-year TIPS, stopping through by 0.5bps at a high rate of 0.174%. US T-note futures (z9) settled 6+ ticks higher at 129-19.</p>",

Kudlow also said the US is unable to separate the security and IP theft issues from China. Elsewhere, President Trump advisor Michael Pillsbury, via SCMP, said Trump is ready to escalate the trade war if a deal is not agreed to soon, suggesting tariffs could be raised to 50% or 100%, although some reporters dismissed the claim over scepticism of Pillsbury’s proximity to discussions. SCMP also reported, citing analysts, that Trump’s new Nation Security Advisor Robert O’Brien has far less experience and sway than his predecessor, John Bolton, reasoning that Trump’s hard-line stance on China is unlikely to be tampered with. China (mouthpiece) Global Times Editor Hu Xijin said the current talks should be cherished by both sides, US officials misread China's goodwill thinking it shows Beijing's weakness; says China is not as anxious to get a deal as the US</p><p><strong>* SAUDI-IRAN: </strong>The NY Times reported that US national security officials are meeting on Thursday to draft possible military action against Iran to present to President Trump on Friday, which includes military strikes. US Secretary of State Pompeo said he would be presenting Trump with the plans of action but caveated it by saying that the US wants a peaceful resolution and to build a coalition; although Trump himself said its possible there might not be a peaceful resolution. Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said in a CNN interview that “all out war” was an option if Iran were to be attacked, adding later in a tweet that there was no such thing as a limited strike (pushing back against the notion which suggested that targeted strikes against specific locations would be different from full scale military intervention). Iran also announced that it had received visas for Foreign Minister Zarif and President Rouhani to attend the UN General Assembly.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:&nbsp;</strong>EU Commission President Juncker struck an upbeat tone saying he thinks we can have a Brexit deal, and Brexit will happen, adding the EU is prepared for a no-deal, but he is unsure if the UK is well prepared. Juncker said his meeting with UK PM Johnson was positive; adding he is doing everything he can to have a deal because he does not like the idea of a no-deal as he thinks it would have catastrophic consequences for at least one year. However, when asked if he had proposals from the UK, he said they arrived on Tuesday but has had no opportunity to read them. On the backstop, Juncker said if the objectives are met - all of them - then the backstop isn't needed. On the supreme court case, President Brenda hopes to publish their decision as early as next week. However, even if the prorogation is overruled, Johnson reportedly doesn’t rule out proroguing parliament again.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>The OJ avoided shaking the boar, leaving its monetary policy settings unchanged this week. However, it did say that there were rising risks from abroad, and intimated that it may ease at the October meeting. Analysts at Oxford Economics say it will be contingent on if global growth slows further, which will lead to other central banks loosening their policy strings, which could have the impact of strengthening the JPY. “We believe a policy rate cut would be the most likely action, accompanied by offsetting measures to limit the adverse side effects from even more negative rates.” It is also note worthy that, bond yields and exchange rates have been little effected by the FOMC and ECB dovish actions, OxEco observes, and while US/China trade tensions shook up markets in August, sending bond yields lower – Japanese yields fell beneath the BOJ’s lower bound in its yield curve control corridor, and the BOJ has apparently looked-through the short-lived drops.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>Policymakers once again stood pat on rates at 0.75%, a unanimous decision, as ongoing uncertainty posed by Brexit continues to cloud the outlook for the MPC. Policymakers judged that underlying growth has slowed, but remains slightly positive; Q3 growth is now seen at 0.2%, cut from the previous 0.3% view. Further ahead, the MPC noted that Increased government spending for 2020-21 could raise UK GDP by around 0.4% over its forecast horizon. Elsewhere, in the wake of August’s 1.7% Y/Y CPI print, inflation is expected to remain slightly below the BOE’s 2% target level for the remainder of the year. The Bank highlighted recent wage data, which showed pay growth that was 0.4ppts higher than its own projections made in August, something which has been touted as a key variable that in ‘normal times’ could have tilted the MPC in favour of lifting rates. However, as has been the case for many MPC meetings since the 2016 Brexit referendum, the UK’s exit from the EU continues to bind the hands of policymakers. And on the subject of Brexit, the MPC maintained its guidance that, in the event of a smooth exit and some recovery in global growth, it would be appropriate to carry out rate rises at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Furthermore, policymakers also maintained the view (despite market cynicism) that in the event of a no deal Brexit, the monetary policy response would not be automatic, and could be in either direction. As a new addition to the minutes of the release, the Bank inserted a further paragraph on Brexit, highlighting the potential fallout from a possible further extension to Article 50. The MPC noted that, in the event of a period of further entrenched uncertainty over the nature of the UK’s eventual trading relationship with the EU, domestically generated inflationary pressures could be reduced as demand growth remains below potential. This statement suggests an increasingly cautious tone at the Bank, as policymakers look to raise concerns about the fallout from the ongoing uncertainty posed by Brexit, and any subsequent additional extensions to Article 50. With this in mind, some analysts have become sceptical that the MPC’s overall guidance for a tightening of monetary policy will materialise; however, the fact that the overall bias was maintained in the minutes suggests that the BoE is reluctant to follow the examples of the FOMC and ECB in easing policy in the immediate future.</p><p><strong>* US AUGUST EXISTING HOME SALES:</strong> Rose by more than expected in August, to 5.49mln units (exp. 5.37mln against a prior 5.42mln). The pace of sales is now at the firmest level since March 2018, and analysts also noted that we saw the first back-to-back rise since 2017. \"This rise in sales, along with higher selling prices, and yesterday’s above-consensus housing starts, means residential investment will finally add to overall GDP growth, boosting prospects for the Q3,\" Wells Fargo says, \"lower mortgage rates are enticing buyers into the market, as evidenced by the recent rise in mortgage purchase applications.\" Wells also observes that supply still remains tight, and prices are still rising. The latest data showed inventories at 4.1 months' worth, down from 4.3 months prior.</p><p><strong>* PHILLY FED:</strong> Printed 12.0 in the headline (exp. 11.0 vs. a prior 16.8). It was a mixed report, with the headline falling by less than had been expected, after decent gains in July and August. However, shipments, inventories, employment and unfilled orders all rose sharply. \"As a result, the average level of the five sub-indexes with equivalents in the ISM manufacturing index rose to a 16-month high,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics says. \"In recent years, this measure has tracked the ISM quite closely, but the Philly numbers have hugely outperformed since late winter. We assume this is because firms in the Philly area are less exposed to trade with China than the average respondent to the ISM survey, though we can’t be sure.\" Pantheon says that for now, the Philly Fed seems to be overstating the strength of the manufacturing sector. \"We think the gap will narrow somewhat when the tariffs on consumer goods work through, hitting real incomes and triggering a broad-based slowdown in growth.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.15 HIGHER AT USD 58.19/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLED USD 0.80 HIGHER AT USD 64.40/BBL: </strong>Oil prices are modestly firmer on Thursday with participants digesting raised chances for military conflict in Iran, signs that supply out of Saudi may not be as rosy as Aramco claims, and growing US production disruptions due to weather conditions. Intensifying the geopolitical risk premium were reports that Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said there is threat of an “all out war” if Iran were to be attacked; US Secretary of State Pompeo saying he would be providing President Trump with information on how to proceed following the Aramco attacks, with a NY Times article suggesting US security advisors were drafting a list of potential military strikes in Iran. WSJ reported that Saudi Aramco had requested 20mln barrels of products for domestic use and exports, although Aramco later refuted the report. The latest storms in the Southern US states is causing disruption for large refineries, with several refiners across Port Arthur, Texas and Beaumont, Texas reporting reduced production, in addition to traffic being halted in the Beaumont shipping channel.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-19. </strong>Treasuries moved slightly higher throughout the day with participants digesting the latest FOMC meeting, a third day of Fed repo operations, in addition to the brewing geopolitical backdrop; by settlement yields were lower across the curve by a basis point or two. The Fed accepted USD 75bln of the USD 83.875bln worth of bids received for its overnight repo operation. Another oversubscribed overnight repo implies continued stress and appears to allude to an ongoing liquidity shortage, which could be more than a short-term phenomenon; the Fed has announced a fourth consecutive overnight operation for Friday at the same time and terms of Thursday. The operations have not, as of yet, had a material impact further out the Treasury curve, but if the “temporary” operations become increasingly less temporary there is potential for the changing dynamics of short-term funding to work its way into longer maturities. Elsewhere, The US funding announcement for 2s, 5s, and 7s remained at an unchanged nominal amount. The Treasury also sold USD 12bln of 10-year TIPS, stopping through by 0.5bps at a high rate of 0.174%.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB’s Coeure said we have been venturing close to the line between monetary and fiscal policy, but there are safeguards, citing issuer limits. The French Governor, who opposed the latest APP resumption, said if the ECB was to embark on QE forever, it would then face the issue of removing market discipline, caveating that so far there has been no sign of that.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0% at 3007, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 7902, Dow Jones -0.2% at 27095</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.2%, Consumer Staples 0%, Energy -0.4%, Financials -0.4%, Health Care 0.5%, Industrials -0.5%, Information Technology 0.2%, Materials 0.2%, Telecommunication Services 0.1%, Utilities 0.4%</p><p><strong>* NORGES: </strong>Norges Bank lifted rates by 25bp to 1.50%; the consensus heading into the meeting was split. The NOK significantly strengthened on the announcement, with EUR/NOK falling to a low of 9.8124, against circa 9.8990 prior to release, before retracing to essentially pre-release levels by the time the press conference had concluded. The retracement was likely due to the Bank’s guidance suggesting that policy rates will remain unchanged in the foreseeable future, a theme reiterated by Governor Olsen during his conference; Olsen himself said that the probability of a rate hike was now around 40%. In terms of the central bank’s forecasts, there were only very minor changes to inflation and non-oil GDP. Looking ahead, given the aforementioned rate stance, ING now believes that the Norges Bank’s rate will remain unchanged at 1.5%. However, beyond 2020, the prospect of a hike will return to focus, the bank argues, albeit dependent on the resolution of geopolitical risk factors, namely the US-China trade war, Brexit and Middle East tensions.</p><p><strong>* SNB: </strong>The SNB left rates unchanged at -0.75%, in-line with the majority of expectations, though disappointing some calls for a cut; the central bank retained its familiar commentary around a willingness to intervene in FX markets if needed. Notably, it did not deem the CHF’s appreciation since the last meeting as sufficient grounds to tweak its currency assessment from “highly valued.” In response, EURCHF moved lower as easing bets positioning was unwound, as well as a seeming recognition from the SNB basing its inflation expectations on unchanged rates over the duration of the forecast horizon. Turning to the forecasts, the SNB significantly slashed its inflation view, and is now expecting 0.4% for 2019 (from 0.6%) and 0.2% for 2020 (from 0.7%); the changes are not too surprising given subdued domestic CPI, which is not likely to pick up any time soon, particularly with the CHF remaining strong. Attention was also on the Bank’s sweetened terms of its tiering system, taking the exemption threshold from 20x to 25x, which in practice may not have much impact on Swiss banks, given that it is already generous (compared to the ECB’s ratio of up to 6). CapEco, however, posits that this update may be the SNB paving the way for further cuts ahead; however, as already mentioned, the Bank’s inflation forecast is dependent on rates being left unchanged at -0.75%. Looking ahead, focus now turns to the Bank’s Quarterly Bulletin released on September 25th.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Microsoft (MSFT) announcing a USD 40bln share repurchase programme gave tailwinds to indices; Target (TGT) also announced a USD 5bln programme and traded firmer. Tesla (TSLA) trade higher after receiving a safety recommendation for one of its vehicles in the US. Darden Restaurants (DRI) traded lower after it posted disappointing sales. Seagate Technologies (STX) and United Steel (X) dipped on soft guidance. Home Depot (HD) and Costco (COST) took a hit from downgrades at DZ Bank and Bernstein, respectively. Akamai Technologies (AKAM) was another underperformer from a downgrade at KeyBanc. Beyond Meat (BYND) benefitted from a Buy initiation at Barclays. Twilio (TWLO) rose on the back of an upgrade at at Morgan Stanley. Healthcare was the outperforming sector after US House Speaker Pelosi’s drug reform bill was labelled a non-starter by Senate Republicans. Datadog (DDOG) IPO’d, successfully, seeing the stock make double digit gains.</p><p><strong>* FX:USD</strong>&nbsp;pared back its FOMC gains now trading back beneath 98.50, likely not helped by lower US yields.&nbsp;<strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong>took its queue from positive Brexit updates in the tail of the session where EC President Juncker said he thinks we can get a deal, pushing GBP to highs of 1.2560. The BOE did little to impact Sterling as all is dependent upon the Brexit outcome. Retail sales also failing to move the currency despite a miss on expectations, as the negative headline was offset by decent revisions.&nbsp;<strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong>was firmer with subdued risk appetite, BOJ also largely stuck to their script.&nbsp;<strong>XAU&nbsp;</strong>also higher on slight haven bids.&nbsp;<strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong>was stronger as SNB left rates unchanged disappointing some who were expecting a cut.&nbsp;<strong>NOK&nbsp;</strong>initially strengthened on its hike this morning, however, eventually weakened as Norges bank suggested it was more of a “one and done” move. In&nbsp;<strong>EMFX,BRL</strong>&nbsp;was an underperformer as the BCB cut rates by 50bp as expected and signalled for further easing;&nbsp;<strong>ZAR&nbsp;</strong>also weaker as it left rates unchanged as expected but cut its GDP forecasts.&nbsp;<strong>TRY and MXN</strong>&nbsp;also lower against the buck following weaker broad EM currencies. TRY was fairly unreactive to CBRT minutes which pointed towards a normalising economy and lower inflation in September; however it did note geopolitics were still a concern.</p>",

WSJ reported that Saudi Aramco had requested 20mln barrels of products for domestic use and exports, although Aramco later refuted the report.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Not much bang for the Buck from a less dovish than anticipated FOMC statement, guidance and rate path plotted by the latest series of SEP dots. Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>has reversed all of its gains made on the perceived ‘hawkish cut’, albeit countered by caution and a heavy dose of uncertainty surrounding the outlook in the ensuing press conference and Q&amp;A from Fed Chair Powell. The index is now back down around 98.325 within a 98.236-625 range compared to 98.698 late yesterday, but technically still holding above 98.000 and Fib support just above.</p><p><strong>CHF/NOK/AUD</strong></p><p>All subject to Central Bank influences, directly or indirectly, but the Franc and Norwegian Crown not behaving in a conventional way or as one might expect given respective SNB and Norges Bank policy decisions. To recap, the former held rates and maintained its high valuation of the Chf, but made more provisions for Swiss banks via a higher exemption gearing for tiered deposits and implied that the -0.75 bp benchmark would remain unchanged for the entire forecast horizon, even though near term inflation and growth estimates were downgraded. Conversely, the latter hiked 25 bp, but also signalled no further changes by trimming the rate path and lowered its projections for the Krona, with Governor Olsen adding that the chances of more policy normalisation are 40%. Eur/Nok initially fell given that only around ½ of those polled were anticipating tightening this month before bouncing ahead of key technical level in the form of the 100 DMA and probing above pre-Norges Bank levels at 9.9100+. In contrast, Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf both eased and remain lower circa 0.9925 and 1.0975, as does Aud/Usd within a 0.6830-0.6780 band in wake of disappointing overnight Aussie jobs data that prompted another shout for the RBA to cut the OCR deeper in October.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CAD/GBP/NZD</strong></p><p>The Yen derived some traction from an unchanged BoJ to augment the broader Greenback retreat that was already underway, but has lost some recovery momentum amidst an overall rise in risk sentiment and with Governor Kuroda stating that policy deliberations will be more intense next month with greater scrutiny over any contagion from external economic headwinds. Usd/Jpy is hovering around 108.00, while Eur/Usd pivots 1.1050 and still broadly rangebound between 1.1000 and 1.1100 amidst multiple option expiries, Eurozone political instability and ECB officials stressing the rationale for last week’s stimulus package. Elsewhere, the Loonie continues to eye crude prices, USMCA developments within the wider global trade situation and events closer to home in advance of Canadian elections, with Usd/Cad holding 1.3300-1.3250 parameters and not really reacting to strong ADP numbers. Likewise, Cable looks trapped in 1.2400-1.2500 confines with little lasting deviation awaiting the next chapters in the UK political and Brexit saga, as the BoE remains sidelined and retail sales data essentially netted out vs consensus when taking back month revisions into account. The Kiwi displayed some resilience around 0.6300 and over 1.0800 on the Aud/Nzd cross, in part due to counterpart weakness and also NZ Q2 GDP that marginally beat, but unlikely to materially impact the RBNZ next week</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some independent factors impacting the likes of the Real and Rand, beyond the wider Dollar moves and swings in market tone, with Usd/Brl up towards 4.1450 at one stage in wake of the latest 50 bp BCB rate cut vs a more steady Usd/Zar in the vicinity of 14.6900 following an unchanged SARB despite dovish/bearish rhetoric.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS:</strong> 80% of desks polled by Reuters expect the SARB to stand pat on rates at its next meeting on 18 September, while the remaining 20% call for a 25bps cut.</p><p><strong>PRIOR MEETING RECAP</strong>: At the previous 18 July meeting, SARB policy makers cut rates by 25bps to 6.5%, emphasised that they wanted CPI to stay at roughly 4.5% and warned of the continued presence of upside risks to inflation (which some desks took as a warning over the possibility of a ZAR sell off on Eskom, fiscal, or credit rating related risks).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECENT RHETORIC:</strong> In his most recent comments, Governor Kganyago was upbeat on the economy, pointing to the strong rebound in Q2 GDP growth and noted that two of the key risks identified at the previous meeting (exchange rate and oil prices) have “behaved”. It is worth noting that since these comments, crude prices have seen significant volatility on the recent escalation of Middle Eastern tensions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DATA:</strong> Those in favour of a rate cut may highlight recent data, pointing to recent soft inflation; August CPI came 4.3%, below the midpoint of the SARB 3-6% target range (but did jump from the 4.0% prior). They may also cite stagnant GDP growth; although Q2’s Q/Q GDP growth came in at a solid 3.1, many sectors in the economy are in contractionary territory, as shown in July’s weak manufacturing PMI, while the SARB looks for growth of just 0.6% this year. Retail sales for July also came in at a respectable 2.0%, below expectations for 2.6% and down from the prior 2.4%.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ARGUMENTS AGAINST A RATE CUT: </strong>Though the data may, on the face of it, the recent data combined with dovish global central bank impulses may suggest there is space for further easing, policy makers may argue the limited ability of rate cuts to stimulate growth; as the SARB has long argued, South Africa requires structural changes to drive the country out of its low-growth trap. Moreover, policy makers may want to maintain a favourable real policy rate buffer both to keep its powder dry and to keep an attractive real interest rate relative to its EM peers, which members could argue can attract investment and promote domestic financial stability. Finally, they may express concern about the recent pick-up in exchange rate volatility since the recent escalation in US/China trade tensions in early August.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Periphery bourses are the slight out performers, seemingly unperturbed by recent developments on the political front in both Spain and Italy. Sectors are broadly in the green, apart from the more defensive utilities and consumer staples sectors. Leading the gains is financials, with higher yields post-FOMC providing support; indeed Lloyds-TSB Group (+2.4%), Deutsche Bank (+1.3%), Société Générale (+2.8%) and Credit Suisse (+1.7%) are the best performers in their respective bourses. Swiss banks were, however, unreactive to the SNB decision, in spite of their decision to raise the exemption threshold for the banking sector from the current 20x to 25x level on 1st November; although, CapEco make the point that SNB’s tiering system was already a more generous system when compared to that announced by the ECB last week, so the most recent tweaks might not make all that much difference. In terms of other individual movers; Next (-4.0%) sunk after the Co. reported results that underwhelmed some expectations; while, United Utilities (-1.5%) are under pressure after the Co. was downgraded at Jeffries. Finally, John Wood Group (+2.2%) caught a bid being upgraded to outperform at Credit Suisse this morning.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>CHF/NOK - </strong>Somewhat contrasting and perhaps even perverse moves in the Franc and Norwegian Krona given respective September policy decisions from the SNB and Norges Bank, as the former stood pat and latter delivered another 25 bp tightening having refrained from flagging this month specifically at the previous meeting in July. However, it seems that the devil was in the detail as a lower rate path and mainly external downside risks to the outlook implied no further normalisation, while the Bank’s Crown forecasts were also shaved from June’s levels and Governor Olsen subsequently assigned less than even odds to higher rates. Hence, having breached near term support at 9.8300, but stopping short of the 100 DMA (9.8080), Eur/Nok has rebounded towards pre-Norges Bank and intraday highs circa 9.9000 whereas Eur/Chf and Usd/Chf have extended post-SNB declines to almost 1.0950 and 0.9900 vs 1.1000+ and 0.9980+ at one stage. For its part, the SNB signalled unchanged rates for the forecast horizon and set even more generous exemption terms for Swiss banks in mitigation of NIRP that remains vital alongside direct currency intervention given that the Franc is still deemed highly valued.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR - </strong>The BoJ maintained current YYC parameters and guidance, as widely expected, but Governor Kuroda intimated that October’s policy deliberations could be more important as the impact of the global economic slowdown and Central Bank actions will be subject to closer scrutiny. However, the Yen has rebounded sharply from lows seen after the Fed’s ‘hawkish’ cut when Usd/Jpy rallied to around 108.45 and back above 108.00 as the DXY pares its gains to 98.275 vs 98.625 at the other extreme. Similarly, the single has regrouped and unwound its underperformance vs the Dollar to reclaim 1.1050 status, but the headline pair may now be stymied by hefty option expiries layered between 1.1000 and 1.1120-30 and totalling 8.3 bn.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/NZD - </strong>All narrowly mixed against the Greenback, as the Pound continues to face stiff resistance around 1.2500 and failed to glean much direction from mixed UK retail sales data ahead of the BoE, or support via reports that written proposals to alter the WA have been sent to the EU. Elsewhere, the Loonie has bounced from just under 1.3300 with some traction from rebounding crude prices and the Kiwi is keeping tabs on the 0.6300 handle following firmer than expected NZ Q2 GDP data overnight.</p><p><strong>AUD - </strong>The clear G10 laggard, as Aud/Usd loses grip of 0.6800 and Aud/Nzd recoils from 1.0800+ to lows of 1.0750 in wake of a worrying Aussie jobs report that ups the ante for RBA easing next month.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>In keeping with Sterling, the Rand has one eye on the SARB for any surprises, with Usd/Zar straddling 14.7000 and anticipating no change in rates, but looking for inspiration from the accompanying statements and guidance – for a more detailed preview of the event and BoE at noon please check out the Research Suite.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment (Aug) 34.7k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 41.1k).</strong> Australian Full Time Employment (Aug) -15.5k (Prev. 34.5k) Australian Unemployment Rate (Aug) 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.3% (Prev. 5.2%)</p><p><strong>New Zealand GDP (Q2) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.6%).

However, overnight US President did impress that “if the US has to do something it will without hesitation” but framed his decision not to strike Iran as a sign of strength. Elsewhere, Gold has firmed somewhat and has tested the USD 1500/oz handle at best, which it briefly lost yesterday post-FOMC.

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF/NOK</strong></p><p>Somewhat contrasting and perhaps even perverse moves in the Franc and Norwegian Krona given respective September policy decisions from the SNB and Norges Bank, as the former stood pat and latter delivered another 25 bp tightening having refrained from flagging this month specifically at the previous meeting in July. However, it seems that the devil was in the detail as a lower rate path and mainly external downside risks to the outlook implied no further normalisation, while the Bank’s Crown forecasts were also shaved from June’s levels and Governor Olsen subsequently assigned less than even odds to higher rates. Hence, having breached near term support at 9.8300, but stopping short of the 100 DMA (9.8080), Eur/Nok has rebounded towards pre-Norges Bank and intraday highs circa 9.9000 whereas Eur/Chf and Usd/Chf have extended post-SNB declines to almost 1.0950 and 0.9900 vs 1.1000+ and 0.9980+ at one stage. For its part, the SNB signalled unchanged rates for the forecast horizon and set even more generous exemption terms for Swiss banks in mitigation of NIRP that remains vital alongside direct currency intervention given that the Franc is still deemed highly valued.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The BoJ maintained current YYC parameters and guidance, as widely expected, but Governor Kuroda intimated that October’s policy deliberations could be more important as the impact of the global economic slowdown and Central Bank actions will be subject to closer scrutiny. However, the Yen has rebounded sharply from lows seen after the Fed’s ‘hawkish’ cut when Usd/Jpy rallied to around 108.45 and back above 108.00 as the <strong>DXY </strong>pares its gains to 98.275 vs 98.625 at the other extreme. Similarly, the single has regrouped and unwound its underperformance vs the Dollar to reclaim 1.1050 status, but the headline pair may now be stymied by hefty option expiries layered between 1.1000 and 1.1120-30 and totalling 8.3 bn.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/NZD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed against the Greenback, as the Pound continues to face stiff resistance around 1.2500 and failed to glean much direction from mixed UK retail sales data ahead of the BoE, or support via reports that written proposals to alter the WA have been sent to the EU. Elsewhere, the Loonie has bounced from just under 1.3300 with some traction from rebounding crude prices and the Kiwi is keeping tabs on the 0.6300 handle following firmer than expected NZ Q2 GDP data overnight.</p><p><strong>AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The clear G10 laggard, as Aud/Usd loses grip of 0.6800 and Aud/Nzd recoils from 1.0800+ to lows of 1.0750 in wake of a worrying Aussie jobs report that ups the ante for RBA easing next month.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In keeping with Sterling, the Rand has one eye on the SARB for any surprises, with Usd/Zar straddling 14.7000 and anticipating no change in rates, but looking for inspiration from the accompanying statements and guidance – for a more detailed preview of the event and BoE at noon please check out the Research Suite.</p>",

The Fed also lowered the IOER by 30bps to 1.8% from 2.1% in which the spread from the top of the target range was widened to 20bps from 15bps and it set the offering rate for overnight repos at 1.7% (5bps below bottom of FFR).

Fed also reiterated the <strong>labour market remains strong</strong> and <strong>economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate</strong>, that household spending is rising at a strong pace but business and fixed investment has weakened, while inflation is running below 2%.</p><p>- <strong>Fed Chair Powell said they lowered rates to maintain strong economy and provide insurance against risks,</strong> while he suggested slower global growth and trade tensions with trade policy tensions \"waxed and waned\". <strong>Powell added there have been additional weakness abroad and trade tensions since the last meeting</strong> which the Fed takes into account but noted that job gains have remained solid in recent months in which it initially expected some slowing.</p><p>- <strong>Fed Chair Powell said he sees modest changes to federal funds rate in coming years but noted the Fed is not on a pre-set course,</strong> while he also suggested that money market issues this week have no implications for stance of monetary policy and economy. <strong>Powell added that temporary overnight measures were effective, that they will conduct operations as necessary to ensure interest rates stay in the target range</strong> and will provide sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent use of the measures is not necessary.</p><p>- Fed Chair Powell said he has always said the level of reserves needed is uncertain, that there is real uncertainty and <strong>it is certainly possible the Fed will have to raise balance sheet earlier than thought</strong>, while <strong>he stated they are prepared to be aggressive if it becomes appropriate</strong>, and if Fed was at the zero lower bound again, he does not believe it will implement negative interest rates.</p><p>Note: There was two-way action after the decision, but ultimately, the decision has been framed as hawkish given the dots which showed the median view for no further rate cuts this year or next, and the long-run dot was left unchanged at 2.5%. In addition, there was no mention of liquidity operations and the language on the economy was not downgraded, which resulted to pressure in T-notes and strength in the DXY, while stocks initially declined but then rebounded amid the presser.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mixed as the region digested the fallout from the FOMC</strong>.

BoJ also maintained its view that Japan's economy is expanding moderately as a trend and its pledge to ease policy without hesitation if there is a risk economy could lose momentum to hit the price goal. Furthermore, BoJ stated they need to pay closer attention to the chance that momentum to hit the price target will be lost and noted the decision on QQE with YCC was made by 7-2 votes with Kataoka and Harada as the regular dissenters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>UK DUP Leader Foster said they are prepared to be \"flexible\" in Brexit talks, while she met with Ireland PM Varadkar last night to discuss backstop options</strong>.

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> initially surged post-FOMC but then reversed overnight on cross-related pressure, BoJ positioning and following a breakdown of 108.00, while antipodeans were lacklustre with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> only briefly supported by the strong GDP data and with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> pressured despite better than expected Employment Change as this was solely fuelled by Part-Time jobs and with the Unemployment Rate increasing to 5.3% which spurred expectations for the RBA to cut rates at the next meeting.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment (Aug) 34.7k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 41.1k).</strong> Australian Full Time Employment (Aug) -15.5k (Prev. 34.5k) Australian Unemployment Rate (Aug) 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.3% (Prev. 5.2%)</p><p><strong>New Zealand GDP (Q2) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.6%).

Nonetheless, most of the overnight markets began positive with broad gains seen in the ASX 200 (+0.6%) aside from metal miners after gold prices retreated post-FOMC, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) initially coat-tailed on the gains in USD/JPY but then pulled back from highs after a reversal in the currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.2%) was subdued and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) traded choppy despite a firm liquidity effort by the PBoC and the HKMA lowering rates by 25bps in lockstep with the Fed, with underperformance Hong Kong led by energy names and as real estate continued to suffer from the political unrest, which resulted to the cancellation of National Day fireworks and China upping its security from its capital to the border with Hong Kong. Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher in a continuation of this week’s rebound with prices only briefly pausing for the BoJ policy announcement which proved to be uneventful, as the central maintained all policy settings as widely expected.</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia trades mostly higher as the region digests the latest Fed cut",
        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive as the region digests the FOMC in which the Fed cut rates by 25bps for a 2nd consecutive meeting as expected to 1.75%-2.00%, although the dot plots showed a median view for a pause through to next year which left a hawkish aftertaste amongst US asset classes. Nonetheless, most of the overnight markets are positive with broad gains seen in the ASX 200 (+0.7%) aside from metal miners after gold prices retreated post-FOMC, while Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) initially coat-tailed on the gains in USD/JPY and remained lifted despite a later reversal in the currency with Akebono Brake Industry surging in Tokyo after the Co.&nbsp; received JPY 56bln of debt relief. Conversely, Hang Seng (-0.9%) is subdued and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) is choppy despite a firm liquidity effort by the PBoC and the HKMA lowering rates by 25bps in lockstep with the Fed, with underperformance Hong Kong led by energy names and as real estate continues to suffer from the political unrest, which has resulted to the cancellation of National Day fireworks and China upping its security from its capital to the border with Hong Kong.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds on to the strength seen in the aftermath of the Fed’s hawkish-perceived cut where some were disappointed by the median expectations for no more cuts in 2019 or 2020, Furthermore, there was a lack of mention regarding liquidity operations and although Powell later stated during the presser that it is possible they will have to raise the balance sheet earlier than thought, the USD remained elevated and President Trump renewed his criticism on the Fed in which he suggested they failed again with no guts, no sense, no vision and are terrible communicator. The greenback’s major counterparts are uneventful with EUR/USD lacklustre and GBP/USD also flat at the 1.1000 and 1.2400 handles respectively, while the latest Brexit-related headlines stated European Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour (544-126) of granting an article 50 extension if the UK is to request one which is a ‘big if’ given PM Johnson’s unwavering do-or-die Brexit stance. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially surged post FOMC before hitting resistance shy of 108.50 amid cross-related pressure and some positioning ahead of the BoJ announcement, while antipodeans were lacklustre with NZD/USD only briefly supported by the strong GDP data and with AUD/USD pressured despite better than expected Employment Change as this was solely fuelled by Part-Time jobs and with the Unemployment Rate increasing to 5.3% from 5.2%.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher but with gains only marginal as markets await the looming BoJ announcement.</p>",
