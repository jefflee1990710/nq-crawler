        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 1 Feb 2019: Trump to outline infrastructure plan in SOTU",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities mixed, dollar flat, treasuries down, crude up.<br />* REAR VIEW: NFP 304k, Trump threats national emergency, Amazon disappoints on guidance, Fed&rsquo;s Bullard reiterates Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC, Kudlow optimistic on trade, ISM Manufacturing beats.<br />* NEXT WEEK: BoE Rate Decision, Australian Building Approvals, EU Producer Prices, US Building Permits, US Durable Goods &amp; Factory Orders, New York ISM Business Conditions, Fed&rsquo;s Mester Speaking, ECB&rsquo;s Mersch Speaking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NON-FARM PAYROLLS: </strong>January saw the US economy add 304,000 new jobs, well above the expected 165,000 and the second consecutive month above the 300,000; ING Economics commented &ldquo;it suggests that the US economy hasn&rsquo;t been adversely impacted by the government shutdown in any meaningful way.&rdquo; The downside from the report was the month-on-month average earnings increasing by just 0.1%, under the expected 0.3%, although the year-on-year figure remained strong at 3.3%. This strong figure comes days after the FOMC announced it was in a data-dependent/neutral mode, so is likely to tilt the committee into a more hawkish stance, some analysts reasoned. Oxford Economics makes the (now) more-outlandish forecast that further hikes are likely, &ldquo;barring further tightening in financial conditions that would negatively impact economic activity, the very strong labour market picture support our expectations that the Fed will keep a tightening bias this year, and hike rates once in Q3 once the clouds hanging over the outlook dissipate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BORDER WALL: </strong>US President Trump said he will be looking at declaring a national emergency over the wall; saying an emergency would have a strong legal standing; adding that he may discuss the wall and national emergency on February 5th, where he will deliver his State of the Union speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SOTU: </strong>Excerpt released by the White House showed that US President Trump is to tell Congress, at State of Unions next week, about progress made on China trade talks and is to communicate that Republicans and Democrats can break decades of political stalemate. He will also ask congress to pass his NAFTA replacement and to give him an infrastructure bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (dove, voter) spoke on a similar tone to Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s post-FOMC remarks, saying the Fed is willing to go in either direction, highlighting its data dependence and he said that rates are in a good place, especially due to low rates globally; Bullard also said the balance sheet would be larger than the Fed thought it would be last year. On inflation, he said feedback has been weak from tight labour markets. And on the labour markets, he noted that Friday&rsquo;s NFP represents a strong labour market, but he noted that the data was backward looking; Bullard believes that the unemployment rate can fall further before he became worried about rates. Elsewhere, he noted recession probabilities have ticked up due to yield curve issues, but now looks for the curve to steepen. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (dove, non-voter) said the base-case for the Fed is to take no action through to June, sees US GDP growing at 2% in 2019 and that the US economy will slow in 2019 as fiscal stimulus wanes, sees downside risks to own forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Following this week&rsquo;s US-China trade talks, NEC Director Kudlow said that they are &ldquo;a way away&rdquo; from putting a China trade deal down on paper, but new ground was made; he sensed an urgency from China to get a deal done. He added that Huawei was not a subject spoken about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM: </strong>The US ISM manufacturing index surprised to the upside, rising to 56.6 in January from a previous 54.3, above the expected 54.0. Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts note &ldquo;we&rsquo;re inclined to think of it as temporary respite from the downward pressure rather than the start of a sustained recovery.&rdquo; The ongoing China trade tensions are weighing on the index, with export orders hitting a 27-month low, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re expecting most of the tariffs to be lifted in the spring, while China&rsquo;s own easing should mean growth bottoms out mid-year,&rdquo; Pantheon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.47 HIGHER AT USD 55.26/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.91 HIGHER AT USD 62.57/BBL. </strong>Oil prices extended their rally on Friday fuelled by hopes that a deal between US and China will be reached soon and amid a strong US jobs report. Prices were also supported by a survey showing the sharpest drop in OPEC output in two years with Saudi Arabia leading the way with a 450k BPD cut in January, while OPEC members pumped 31mln BPD last month; this strengthens the view that supply cuts are going continuing. Elsewhere, Iraqi oil exports averaged 3.649mln BPD in January. Citi warns however that &ldquo;while the news of the day is supportive, we continue to see rising US crude oil production and surplus gasoline inventories as limits on the markets upside potential&rdquo;. Looking ahead, UBS notes that in the medium-term &ldquo;concerns over global demand are offset by the growing recognition that supply-side issues are the dominant variable in the medium-term&rdquo;. Baker Hughes Rig Count reported the US rig total rigs count fell by 14 to 1055; oil rigs fell 15 to 847, and gas rigs rose by 1 to 198.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2706, NASDAQ -0.5% at 6876, DJI +0.3% at 25063. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +1.8%, Materials +0.5%, Industrials +0.2%, Cons Discretionary -1.8%, Cons staples -0.3%, Healthcare +0.2%, Financials +0.5%, Tech +0.6%, Telecoms -0.3%, Utilities -0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Retail titan Amazon (AMZN) was a headwind for indices today, it beat on top and bottom line estimates but lowered its revenue guidance and noted increased capex in 2019. The DJIA&rsquo;s oil components Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) opened higher, where both beat EPS estimates but missed on revenue; LyondellBasell (LYB) opened lower after missing both estimates. In healthcare, Merck (MRK) traded higher on the open after beating top and bottom line estimates. Cigna (CI) beat estimates but moved lower on the open as it lowered its guidance. Honeywell (HON) and Symantec (SYMC) traded in the green after beating EPS and revenue estimates. Teva (TEVA) moved higher after receiving a regulatory positive opinion on a migraine drug in the EU. DowDuPont (DWDP) and General Electric (GE) opened lower on the back of downgrades at JPMorgan and Vertical Research respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED TICKS -17 AT 121-30. </strong>Treasuries ended Friday&rsquo;s session in negative territory -supported by a strong US labour market report which added 304k jobs to in January. Optimism continued also on the trade front fuelled by hopes that a deal will be put on paper by March 1st. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.7bps at settlement. Light profit taking emerged into the European session close but the complex extended weakness into the US afternoon trade. The curve was mixed; steeper at the front end and flatter at the long end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Wednesday proved to be a watershed for the Dollar this week, as dovish pre-FOMC market expectations were not just realised, but exceeded. Indeed, the Fed signalled a pause in policy normalisation, stress patience going forward and remove guidance for further gradual hikes to shift from a tightening to neutral stance. Moreover, the statement included a caveat that the pace and extent of balance sheet reduction may be adjusted if economic and financial conditions warrant a change in the current QT run-off rate. The DXY hit weekly lows of 95.157 in response, and on the back of &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sell signals for month end rebalancing before deriving some support from SOMA demand and another bumper US payrolls number to trade back up around 95.500 and above the 200 DMA (95.300-350), albeit still off its 95.987 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>The single currency and Sterling are at opposite ends of Friday&rsquo;s G10 spectrum, and this divergent trend pretty much sums up the week overall, as Eur/Usd sits towards the top of a 1.1388-1.1515 range vs Cable closer to 1.3044 than 1.3212 and Eur/Gbp nearer 0.8795 against 0.8632 at one stage. Aside from the aforementioned Greenback moves, more weak Eurozone data was offset to an extent by an uptick in core inflation to underpin the Euro, alongside technical resilience as the 200 DMA held despite several downside attempts. However, the Pound was unable to overcome ongoing Brexit uncertainty after UK Parliament voted in favour of amendments rejecting no deal and the Irish backstop as it stands, leaving PM May trying to negotiate the WA that the EU insists cannot be altered. Note also, a miss in the manufacturing PMI would have been even more pronounced without record high stock-piling due to Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, AUD, NZD: </strong>All net gainers on the week vs their US counterpart, as the Loonie climbs above its 200 DMA (1.3128) to test 1.3090 vs weekly lows circa 1.3286, the Aussie holds around 0.7250 within a 0.7295-0.7135 band and the Kiwi actually nudges new peaks of 0.6940. The non-US Dollars have been encouraged by early positive vibes from US-China trade talks, but the Cad was also fuelled by higher crude prices, the Aud by firmer Q4 CPI and the Nzd by S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings outlook upgrade to positive from stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY: </strong>Both ending Friday&rsquo;s EU session, and by definition the week as a whole, on the back foot, as the Buck got an extra fillip from beats in construction spending, ISM manufacturing (although priced paid were sub-50) and the final Michigan sentiment reading, though the Franc also had disappointing Swiss retail sales and manufacturing PMI to contend with. Usd/Chf currently mid-range between 0.9900-95 on the wide, while Usd/Jpy has rebounded from 108.50 or thereabouts to 109.40. Note, the latter pair is still off the highs just shy of 109.75 as US Treasury yields remain net lower post-Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, NOK: </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi crowns as a series of worse than expected Swedish macro releases compounded market expectations that the Riksbank may now be on hold for a lengthy period, and could roll back its repo rate path at this month&rsquo;s policy meeting. Eur/Sek almost rallied to 10.4000 from 10.3240 at the start of the week and 10.3100 at the other extreme, while Eur/Nok hit lows of 9.6450 vs 9.7430 at one stage and roughly 9.7175 early on Monday against the backdrop of rebounding oil (as noted above) and with the Norges Bank still on track to tighten again in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: Turkish CPI, UK Construction PMI, Eurozone PPI, US Factory Orders Tuesday: Australian Trade, RBA Rate Decision, Eurozone (F), UK and US Services PMIs, Eurozone Retail Sales, Canadian Trade, US ISM Non-Manufacturing Wednesday: US Trade, Australian Jobs Report Thursday: BoE Rate Decision, Minutes &amp; QIR, RBI &amp; Banxico Rate Decision Friday: German Trade, Norwegian GDP, Canadian Jobs. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21073/download\">Click here to access the RANsquawk Week In Focus report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Central Bank Weekly: </strong>Reviewing FOMC; Previewing BOE, RBA, RBI, Banxico, CBR <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21074/download\">Click here to access the RANsquawk Central Bank Weekly report</a></p>\r\n",

Prices were also supported by a survey showing the sharpest drop in OPEC output in two years with Saudi Arabia leading the way with a 450k BPD cut in January, while OPEC members pumped 31mln BPD last month; this strengthens the view that supply cuts are going continuing. Elsewhere, Iraqi oil exports averaged 3.649mln BPD in January. Citi warns however that &ldquo;while the news of the day is supportive, we continue to see rising US crude oil production and surplus gasoline inventories as limits on the markets upside potential&rdquo;. Looking ahead, UBS notes that in the medium-term &ldquo;concerns over global demand are offset by the growing recognition that supply-side issues are the dominant variable in the medium-term&rdquo;. Baker Hughes Rig Count reported the US rig total rigs count fell by 14 to 1055; oil rigs fell 15 to 847, and gas rigs rose by 1 to 198.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Plan B, FOMC, month end and NFP",
        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday proved to be a watershed for the Dollar this week, as dovish pre-FOMC market expectations were not just realised, but exceeded. Indeed, the Fed signalled a pause in policy normalisation, stress patience going forward and remove guidance for further gradual hikes to shift from a tightening to neutral stance. Moreover, the statement included a caveat that the pace and extent of balance sheet reduction may be adjusted if economic and financial conditions warrant a change in the current QT run-off rate. The DXY hit weekly lows of 95.157 in response, and on the back of &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sell signals for month end rebalancing before deriving some support from SOMA demand and another bumper US payrolls number to trade back up around 95.500 and above the 200 DMA (95.300-350), albeit still off its 95.987 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency and Sterling are at opposite ends of Friday&rsquo;s G10 spectrum, and this divergent trend pretty much sums up the week overall, as Eur/Usd sits towards the top of a 1.1388-1.1515 range vs Cable closer to 1.3044 than 1.3212 and Eur/Gbp nearer 0.8795 against 0.8632 at one stage. Aside from the aforementioned Greenback moves, more weak Eurozone data was offset to an extent by an uptick in core inflation to underpin the Euro, alongside technical resilience as the 200 DMA held despite several downside attempts. However, the Pound was unable to overcome ongoing Brexit uncertainty after UK Parliament voted in favour of amendments rejecting no deal and the Irish backstop as it stands, leaving PM May trying to negotiate the WA that the EU insists cannot be altered. Note also, a miss in the manufacturing PMI would have been even more pronounced without record high stock-piling due to Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All net gainers on the week vs their US counterpart, as the Loonie climbs above its 200 DMA (1.3128) to test 1.3090&nbsp;vs weekly lows circa 1.3286, the Aussie holds around 0.7250 within a 0.7295-0.7135 band and the Kiwi actually nudges new peaks of 0.6940. The non-US Dollars have been encouraged by early positive vibes from US-China trade talks, but the Cad was also fuelled by higher crude prices, the Aud by firmer Q4 CPI and the Nzd by S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings outlook upgrade to positive from stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both ending Friday&rsquo;s EU session, and by definition the week as a whole, on the back foot, as the Buck got an extra fillip from beats in construction spending, ISM manufacturing (although priced paid were sub-50) and the final Michigan sentiment reading, though the Franc also had disappointing Swiss retail sales and manufacturing PMI to contend with. Usd/Chf currently mid-range between 0.9900-95 on the wide, while Usd/Jpy has rebounded from 108.50 or thereabouts to 109.40. Note, the latter pair is still off the highs just shy of 109.75 as US Treasury yields remain net lower post-Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi crowns as a series of worse than expected Swedish macro releases compounded market expectations that the Riksbank may now be on hold for a lengthy period, and could roll back its repo rate path at this month&rsquo;s policy meeting. Eur/Sek almost rallied to 10.4000 from 10.3240 at the start of the week and 10.3100 at the other extreme, while Eur/Nok hit lows of 9.6450 vs 9.7430 at one stage and roughly 9.7175 early on Monday against the backdrop of rebounding oil (as noted above) and with the Norges Bank still on track to tighten again in March.</p>\r\n",

The FTSE 100&rsquo;s Shell (+0.6%) shares strengthened after initially opening in the red as the energy sector is underperforming weighed on by the oil complex. Other sectors are broadly in the green. Other notable movers include, Electrolux (+9.8%) who are at the top of the Stoxx 600 following a revenue beat and the Co&rsquo;s largest investor supporting their proposed split. JC Decaux (+9.4%) are also at the top of the Stoxx 600, following their earnings. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Caixabank (-7.9%) as their net profit missed expectations. Deutsche Bank (-3.4%) were the mornings most notable earnings release as the Co. shrank for the 8th consecutive quarter, with sources stating that time is running out for the Co. to turn around on its own; making a merger with Commerzbank (-1.2%) or another European bank more likely. Separately Adidas (-2.9%) are in the red following a downgrade at UBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD The Dollar is pretty evenly split in terms of relative performance against G10 counterparts going into the monthly US jobs data, as the DXY hovers around 95.500 and roughly midway between weekly highs and lows, so far (95.987-157). However, the Buck remains pressured after Wednesday&rsquo;s dovish Fed and net short positioning for month end, so a bullish/upbeat NFP report is needed to confirm a near term base for the index, and expectations are not skewed to the upside after such a bumper payroll number last time around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP Sterling is the clear laggard, and already looking precarious before the UK manufacturing PMI miss. Indeed, the Pound succumbed to accelerated selling once Cable relinquished the 1.3100 handle and Eur/Gbp breached 0.8750, with the former subsequently declining through the 200 HMA (1.3085-90) and testing, but not yet breaking the 200 DMA (1.3045), while the cross got to within a few pips of offers said to be sitting up at 0.8800 before fading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD Also underperforming, albeit to a lesser extent, with the Aud undermined by benign Aussie PPI data and a sub-forecast/even deeper contraction in China&rsquo;s Caixin manufacturing PMI. Aud/Usd is currently around 0.7260 having almost reached 0.7300 yesterday, while the Loonie continues to meet resistance ahead of 1.3100 and some key chart support just above the big figure following pretty sanguine comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins on Canadian wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/NZD All modestly firmer vs the Usd, with the Franc rebounding from 0.9950+ levels towards 0.9920 and not unduly deterred by weaker than expected Swiss retail sales or headline manufacturing PMI. Similarly, the single currency largely took more bleak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs in stride, before deriving some traction from firmer core inflation and technically a recovery in Eur/Usd of its 100 DMA (1.1441). The Kiwi remains above 0.6900, and perhaps benefiting from the Aud&rsquo;s demise as the cross retreats back below 1.0500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY On a more even keel than major rivals and holding above 109.00 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have seen a little more downside and briefly tested near term chart support around 165.59 with some follow-through selling pushing the 10 year German benchmark down to 165.48 (-19 ticks), but not quite low enough to trip stops and flush out more sellers targeting the next downside technical target area between 165.30-28. Perhaps the core Eurozone bond gleaned a degree of traction from the far bigger and more aggressive slide in Italian debt in wake of a dire manufacturing PMI, with losses stacking up to 188 ticks at one stage. Meanwhile, Gilts have been more contained and only extended a couple of ticks to the downside, at 123.47 (-6 ticks vs +14 ticks at the Liffe high) before finding underlying bids, and US Treasuries are holding in, with the curve fractionally flatter ahead of NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (Unch) are choppy, with prices for both around the middle of a slim USD 1/bbl range; impacted by global growth concerns following the weak Chinese PMI data. In terms of recent news flow, Russian oil product exports from the Port of Tuapse are forecast at 1.128mln tonnes vs. 1.463mln in January. Markets are looking ahead to today&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count, which previously showed total rigs increased by 9 to 1059, with gas rigs up by 9 at 862.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) is also around the middle of its range, with the yellow metal uneventful mimicking the dollar&rsquo;s lack of direction ahead of today&rsquo;s US jobs report. Elsewhere, Glencore have said they see 2019 copper production at 1.54MT, alongside the Co&rsquo;s subsidiary being told to halt the production of a new system which removes uranium from their cobalt supplies.

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar is pretty evenly split in terms of relative performance against G10 counterparts going into the monthly US jobs data, as the DXY hovers around 95.500 and roughly midway between weekly highs and lows, so far (95.987-157). However, the Buck remains pressured after Wednesday&rsquo;s dovish Fed and net short positioning for month end, so a bullish/upbeat NFP report is needed to confirm a near term base for the index, and expectations are not skewed to the upside after such a bumper payroll number last time around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling is the clear laggard, and already looking precarious before the UK manufacturing PMI miss. Indeed, the Pound succumbed to accelerated selling once Cable relinquished the 1.3100 handle and Eur/Gbp breached 0.8750, with the former subsequently declining through the 200 HMA (1.3085-90) and testing, but not yet breaking the 200 DMA (1.3045), while the cross got to within a few pips of offers said to be sitting up at 0.8800 before fading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also underperforming, albeit to a lesser extent, with the Aud undermined by benign Aussie PPI data and a sub-forecast/even deeper contraction in China&rsquo;s Caixin manufacturing PMI. Aud/Usd is currently around 0.7260 having almost reached 0.7300 yesterday, while the Loonie continues to meet resistance ahead of 1.3100 and some key chart support just above the big figure following pretty sanguine comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins on Canadian wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All modestly firmer vs the Usd, with the Franc rebounding from 0.9950+ levels towards 0.9920 and not unduly deterred by weaker than expected Swiss retail sales or headline manufacturing PMI. Similarly, the single currency largely took more bleak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs in stride, before deriving some traction from firmer core inflation and technically a recovery in Eur/Usd of its 100 DMA (1.1441). The Kiwi remains above 0.6900, and perhaps benefiting from the Aud&rsquo;s demise as the cross retreats back below 1.0500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a more even keel than major rivals and holding above 109.00 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n",

However, the corresponding cash yield is still proving to be sticky around 0.15% and just a few bp above its circa 2 year low, and we suspect preventing a more concerted run on 166.00 and upside chart levels close to the next big figure (like 165.91, which is a 50% Fib of the early January move, and 165.98). Back to Friday&rsquo;s agenda, bad news on the PMI front has already been factored in to an extent via the flash surveys, but preliminary pan inflation could surprise on the downside and give Bunds added impetus/incentive to advance further.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded cautious as disappointing Chinese data clouded over the momentum from Wall St. where most major indices finished positive and the S&amp;P 500 posted its best January performance in over 3 decades, with sentiment driven by earnings and progress in US-China trade discussions. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) both opened higher amid broad optimism following the trade talks and with corporate updates dominating news flow in Japan, although China slowdown concerns later pressured both indices off intraday highs. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) traded indecisive after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI printed its weakest in around 3 years. However, the mainland has kept afloat on trade-related hopes and after another liquidity effort by the PBoC ahead of the Lunar New Year week-long market closure, while Barclays also speculate the PBoC could lower interest rates as soon as today due to the weak data. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they continued to track the upside in T-notes in the aftermath of this week&rsquo;s dovish Fed, and as Japanese yields continued to decline in which 20yr and 30yr JGB yields fell to their lowest since 2016.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat mixed as disappointing Chinese data clouded over the momentum from US where the Trump administration&rsquo;s trade discussions with China were said to have progressed, and in which most majors finished positive with the S&amp;P 500 posting its best January performance in over 3 decades. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch) were both initially higher amid broad optimism following the US-China trade talks and with earnings dominating news flow in Japan, although China slowdown concerns later pressured both indices. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. are also indecisive after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI data (48.3 vs. Exp. 49.6, Prev. 49.7) printed its weakest in around 3 years, although the mainland is kept afloat on trade-related hopes with the US to send a delegation to China later this month, as well as another liquidity effort by the PBoC ahead of the Lunar New Year week-long market closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY trades sideways overnight amid tentativeness ahead of today&rsquo;s key risk Non-Farms Payrolls data, although it has held on to the prior session&rsquo;s gains where focus centred on the encouraging tone during trade discussions. As such, the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD subdued after its recent failure to maintain above 1.1500 and with GBP/USD now at a sub-1.3100 level. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is rangebound amid the indecisive risk tone which has also hampered its high-beta peers, with AUD/USD further impacted by softer Australian PPI figures and the weak Chinese PMI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they continue to track the upside in T-notes in the aftermath of this week&rsquo;s dovish Fed, and as Japanese yields continued to decline in which 20yr and 30yr JGB yields fell to their lowest since 2016.</p>\r\n",
