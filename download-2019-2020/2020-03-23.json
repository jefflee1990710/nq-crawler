(Newswires)</p><p>UK PM Johnson announced a 3-week lockdown which police can enforce through fines and dispersing crowds in which people will only be allowed to shop for basic necessities and are only allowed outdoor exercise alone or with members of your households. Furthermore, people can travel to work only where it is absolutely necessary and restrictions will be relaxed if the evidence shows the country is able to, while PM Johnson noted it is vital to slow the spread of the disease that without a huge national effort, there will come a moment where no health service in the world could possibly cope. (Newswires)</p><p>IMF sees a global economic recession in 2020 and a recovery in 2021, while it added that investors have already removed USD 83bln from emerging markets since the crisis began which is the largest ever outflow recorded.

Furthermore, it was also reported that G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed to develop joint action plan with individual and collective actions according to a statement, while they discussed preparations for virtual limit leaders summit \"in a few days\" (without being precise on the date). (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EU</strong></p><p>EU Consumer Confidence Flash (Mar) -11.6 vs. Exp. -14.2 (Prev. -6.6). (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Fed announced major expansion of market supports - open ended Treasury and MBS purchases in required amounts of USD 75bln Treasury purchases per day this week and USD 50bln MBS. Fed expanded some measures and established Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, while it noted that new programmes will provide up to USD 300 billion in new financing to employers, consumers, and businesses. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed said corporations that defer interests or principals payments in its new program will not be allowed to carry out share buybacks and that new facilities are consistent with existing Fed powers and lending to special purpose vehicles similar to programs used in the prior crisis. Furthermore, the Fed is still putting together its Main Street lending program which could complement congressional proposals to help small businesses, while new TALF program should open up the currently challenged markets for auto loans and other forms of credit. (Newswires)</p><p>New York Fed said it will buy USD 75bln in treasuries on a daily basis this week. (Newswires)</p><p>US NEC Director Kudlow said he expects Senate to agree on the bill either Monday or Tuesday and that support for businesses is an essential element of the economic stimulus bill. (FBN)</p><p>US Senate Minority Leader Schumer said an agreement on the stimulus bill is close and believes it can be done today, while he added that Senate procedural votes are largely irrelevant and Democrats will agree to speed up the passage bill following an agreement. (Newswires)</p><p>US Democrats proposed a new bill which reportedly equates to USD 2.5trln and includes USD 1,500 direct payment to citizens, USD 150bln health care appropriations (plus USD 80bln loans), USD 600/week unemployment benefit for virus-affected; USD 215bln state and local funds</p><p>US lawmakers are looking at converting USD 58bln of loan support into cash grants to cover payroll costs, according to sources. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>US equity futures hit limit down a few minutes after opening Sunday moving following the rejection of the stimulus bill in the Senate, to reverse such moves after the Fed unleashed a fresh bazooka later in the session – removing upper limits on QE and a widening of its credit facilities – which saw all major assets, excluding the dollar, catch a bid. However, the pick-up in sentiment proved short-lived as the equity move faded through the session, although a late rally saw the NDX cross into the green. The narrative remains that monetary policy is effective only as far as ensuring the smooth transmission of credit availability to the economy and that the pressure is on fiscal authorities to provide strong enough support to businesses and households, although adequate policy can still only go so far to support the economy and markets, where the rapid spread of the virus is causing a material devaluation of risk assets – note that corporates across the world continue to congest newswires with guidance cuts, dividend slashes, share buyback halts and credit facility drawdowns. Dollar strength continued on Monday, although the style of such was more modest and reassuring to stability, as Gold and Treasuries maintained a bid, whereas last week exhibited sessions of outright liquidation across every asset that wasn’t the greenback. Boeing (BA) saw solid gains and outperformed the DJ after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs, who stated it has adequate liquidity to cover negative free cash flow for the year given its current cash balance and the remainder of its revolving credit facility. During hours, BA were halted as it announced its Puget Sound, Washington, factory (which holds nearly half of its global workforce) is to halt production for two weeks and start reducing capacity from Monday, although it will continue to pay those who work from home and will pay 10 days sick leave for those who do not. SPX -2.93% at 2237, NDX +0.18% at 7007, DJIA -3.04% at 18592.</p><p>THE TPLEX BULL FLATTENED amid the Fed’s QE bazooka and poor risk appetite. The complex legged higher after the Fed announced its open-ended (“unlimited”) Treasury and MBS purchases, alongside a pronounced widening of the credit facilities it announced. Furthermore, the disagreement of Congress to reach an economic stimulus bill cut risk appetite, as well as casting some doubts onto the potential for an immediate ramp-up in US debt. However, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin capped the bid somewhat on mentioning of a 30-year Bond-issuing spree to ensue, although desks noted the presence of specs, CTAs and real money all buying on weakness. Meanwhile, the corporate issuance market continues to claw back, seven IG issuers coming to the dollar market on Monday, including a USD 4bln 5-parter from General Dynamics (GD), USD 5bln 5-parter from Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG), and a USD 6bln 2-parter from Wells Fargo (WFC). By settlement, the TPLEX had bull flattened, 2s30s -4bps, 2s10s -5bps, and 2s5s -5bps; 2-year -7bps, 10-year -16bps, and 30-year -20bps. T-note futures (M0) settled 1 point 15 ticks higher at 138-06+.</p>",

However, the pick-up in sentiment proved short-lived as the equity move faded through the session, although a late rally saw the NDX cross into the green. The narrative remains that monetary policy is effective only as far as ensuring the smooth transmission of credit availability to the economy and that the pressure is on fiscal authorities to provide strong enough support to businesses and households, although adequate policy can still only go so far to support the economy and markets, where the rapid spread of the virus is causing a material devaluation of risk assets – note that corporates across the world continue to congest newswires with guidance cuts, dividend slashes, share buyback halts and credit facility drawdowns. Dollar strength continued on Monday, although the style of such was more modest and reassuring to stability, as Gold and Treasuries maintained a bid, whereas last week exhibited sessions of outright liquidation across every asset that wasn’t the greenback.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>US STIMULUS: </strong>Senate voted 47-47 on the coronavirus bill which failed to reach the 60 votes required to pass the first procedural hurdle. The legislation involved would have amounted to around USD 2trl vs. the touted USD 1trl last week; includes around USD 1.3-1.4trl of spending with the remainder coming in the form of loans that would eventually be paid back. Senate Democrats were reportedly sending signals to Republicans on the need to revise the bill while negotiations continue. Following the defeat, US Senate Majority Leader McConnell initially said the Senate will re-vote on the motion to proceed at 0945EDT on Monday, although reports later noted that this will be later than previously planned as the Senate is to return at 1200EDT, while Senate Democratic Leader Schumer believes coronavirus bill issues can be resolved in next 24 hours; Schumer and Mnuchin met at 09:00 EDT on Monday and House Democrats could release a new draft on Monday. Although at the time of writing, it is yet to be seen if a deal can be reached shortly; Senate Majority Leader McConnell said the delays could push the stimulus package to Friday. Elsewhere, US President Trump approved New York, Washington, and California disaster declarations, which allows federal funds to flow into the states.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>UK RESTRICTIONS: </strong>UK officials have continued to warn Britons that they should stay home, and threatened that it could take further measures quickly if required to ensure that outcome. The warning came amid many weekend reports which suggested people were ignoring the government's wishes, undermining its efforts to contain the spread of COVID in the UK. Note that PM Johnson will hold a press conference to announced the Government’s next measures against the outbreak, with speculation that it will tighten its restrictive measures, following an emergency COBRA meeting. The Telegraph reported that all UK shops - except supermarkets, food stores, pharmacies – are to be asked to close; noting this was the topic of discussion at the COBRA meeting.</p><p><strong>EU MEASURES: </strong>EU’s Dombrovskis said the EU Commission is likely to present a tool for the Euro zone’s ESM bailout fund to fight the effects of the coronavirus epidemic which could unlock unlimited sovereign Bond buying. EU Economic Commissioner Gentiloni, in the FT, believes a fiscal support deal from the EU could be agreed in time for an EU Leaders video conference on Thursday, with three cited options: ESM credit lines, narrow liquidity facilities for emergency health-care and introduction of coronabonds. However, German Economy Minister Altmaier, in Handelsblatt, rejected the introduction of Euro bonds, calling talk of such measures a \"phantom debate\". Meanwhile, EU Finance Ministers endorsed the suspension of EU limits on government borrowing.</p><p><strong>GERMANY STIMULUS: </strong>German Government set up a rescue package of EUR 500bln for companies and banks; to authorize EUR 350bln in new debt to fight the coronavirus. The Government signed off on a EUR 156bln supplementary budget, which includes a EUR 33.5bln drop in tax-revenue and EUR 122.8bln in new spending; raising EUR 150bln in additional debt. The German debt agency said it is not planning any new debt instruments, such as a 50-year bond.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN RESTRICTIONS:</strong> The German Public Health Institute Head said it is seeing first signs that the exponential upward curve in virus infections in Germany is flattening. This came amid the country tightening restrictions further so that no more than two people may be together in public places unless they are family or living together, while restaurants will be closed aside from takeout and delivery for initially a 2-week period. Meanwhile, Chancellor Merkel, after self-isolating following contact with an infected individual, received the all-clear as her test returned negative. Italy raised COVID-19 restrictions in which it stated people cannot exercise outside and ordered a halt to almost all industrial production during a 2-week period; more optimistically, the daily rate of increases in cases and deaths has been declining in the country, although it is worth highlighting the potential capacity in testing availability. Spanish PM Sanchez is seeking parliamentary approval to extend the state of emergency to April 11th. French PM Macron is to extend confinement measures beyond March within days, French press reported.

Furthermore, the Committee will include purchases of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in its agency mortgage-backed security purchases. Meanwhile, the Fed announced that its large-scale overnight and term operations will continue to be offered; takeup currently remains low, however, as the market repo rate remains attractive; furthermore, with funding rates remaining close to the ZLB on Monday, the reverse repo facility saw an increased take up.</p><p><strong>FED FACILITIES: </strong>A skew of facilities, taking the form of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), were either announced or extended on Monday, which the Fed said, collectively, will provide up to USD 300 billion in new financing to employers, consumers, and businesses; all of which are each backed by a USD 10bln investment by the Treasury. The Fed also stated that any corporations that participate in the new facilities that defer interest or principal payments will be banned from share buybacks. It established the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) for new bond and loan issuance (maturity of four years or less) and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds (maturity of five years or less). It revived the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which accepts a wider range of collateral such as auto loans, student loans, and credit card receivables, among other types. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was expanded to include high-quality, tax-exempt commercial paper as eligible securities; additionally, the pricing of the facility has been reduced. The Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) was expanded to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) and bank certificates of deposit. The Fed also said it was in the process of establishing a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to eligible SMEs, which it said could complement Congressional proposals.</p><p><strong>FED'S KASHKARI</strong> (Voter, Dove) said the US will at least have a mild recession and that that the Fed will ensure banks have enough cash to meet demand. Kashkari also stated the Fed is being very aggressive but there is more we can do if needed and that the Fed has infinite cash to support the financial system.</p><p><strong>FED’S BULLARD</strong> (non-voter, dove) reiterated that the Fed was willing to do more to help address the coronavirus crisis and warned that unless more was fiscally done, unemployment could reach 30% in Q2 due to virus shutdowns, which he caveated by saying is a good sign that the country is self-isolating, while he also suggested that GDP could decline greater than 50%.</p><p><strong>RBNZ:</strong> The Reserve Bank Sunday announced it was launching a NZD 30bln government bonds purchase facility. The amount is equivalent to about half of the NZ bonds in circulation, and even accounting for the government's increased issuance over the course of 2020 to finance boosted spending programmes, the central bank will hold around 40% of NZ govvies by the conclusion of its current programme. Capital Economics said that while monetary and fiscal policy are now firing on all cylinders, more stimulus was still likely to be needed. \"We expect the RBNZ to figure out how to operationalise negative interest rates in the coming months,\" CapEco writes, \"we then expect the Bank to cut the OCR into negative territory as the forthcoming surge in unemployment will make it very difficult to meet its inflation and employment targets.\" CapEco thinks the RBNZ will cut its OCR to -0.75% by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>ECB’S DE GUINDOS</strong> warned the virus outbreak will place Europe into a recession but noted it should be transitory and that the regional economy will be back into expansion on the 2nd semester, while he added that the EU should consider Eurobonds to deal with the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>ECB’S VISCO </strong>said the ECB is ready to increase size of bond purchase programme, change its composition and length in time.</p><p><strong>ECB’S SCHNABEL </strong>said the ECB is in a comfortable position of having a large set of tools which have not been used to the full extent, while she added the ECB stands ready to conduct further measures if required.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.73 HIGHER AT USD 23.36/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 0.05 HIGHER AT USD 27.03/BBL.</strong></p><p>The crude complex was initially hit as broader risk sentiment soured after the US Senate failed to gather 60 votes needed to pass the coronavirus bill. However, the crude complex found some support from the Fed’s QE expansion, although WTI and Brent did still remain lower on the day at approximately USD 22/bbl and USD 27/bbl, respectively, although heading into settlement crude spiked and entered into positive territory to settle marginally higher on the day. Over the weekend, comments from Russia speaking to Tass stated Russia did not look for an end to cooperation with OPEC, nor the sudden fall in oil prices, putting the blame on to the Gulf nations, once again suggesting no sign of easing between the two sides.&nbsp; Energy Minister Novak reportedly met with oil companies today but there was no mention of the price war, according to Energy Intel, who also stated there would be no talks of production cuts. Elsewhere in Russia, it has reportedly agreed to increase the discount for its oil supplies to Belarus by USD 12/tonne to USD 15.7/tonne, but Belarus is yet to say how much oil it will purchase, according to sources. Meanwhile, in Saudi, crude oil exports averaged 7.2-7.3mln BPD for March so far, according to Tanker Trackers, which is relatively unchanged from February despite previous reports suggesting the Kingdom would increase its exports to 10mln BPD. Elsewhere, two vessels scheduled to export 2.9mln bbls of Venezuelan crude have been delayed, Kuwait is taking all steps necessary to ensure production continues (Kuwait was producing 2.66mln BPD at the end of February), and Libya’s NOC announced it is to reduce staffing at its oil fields and ports, all due to the coronavirus, which has seen oil giants Shell (RDSA. LN) and Total (FP FP) increase its cost cuts and halt share repurchase programmes due to the collapse in oil prices.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 1 POINT 15 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-06+.</strong></p><p><strong>THE TPLEX BULL FLATTENED</strong> amid the Fed’s QE bazooka and poor risk appetite. The complex legged higher after the Fed announced its open-ended (“unlimited”) Treasury and MBS purchases, alongside a pronounced widening of the credit facilities it announced. Furthermore, the disagreement of Congress to reach an economic stimulus bill cut risk appetite, as well as casting some doubts onto the potential for an immediate ramp-up in US debt. However, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin capped the bid somewhat on mentioning of a 30-year Bond-issuing spree to ensue, although desks noted the presence of specs, CTAs and real money all buying on weakness. Meanwhile, the corporate issuance market continues to claw back, seven IG issuers coming to the dollar market on Monday, including a USD 4bln 5-parter from General Dynamics (GD), USD 5bln 5-parter from Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG), and a USD 6bln 2-parter from Wells Fargo (WFC). By settlement, the TPLEX had bull flattened, 2s30s -4bps, 2s10s -5bps, and 2s5s -5bps; 2-year -7bps, 10-year -16bps, and 30-year -20bps.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: SPX -2.93% at 2237, NDX +0.18% at 7007, DJIA -3.04% at 18592.</strong></p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy -6.65%, Financials -6.11%, Real Estate -5.56%, Utilities -5.33%, Health -4.97%, Materials -4.91%, Industrials -4.49%, Cons Stpl -2.97%, Technology -0.98%, Communication Svs -0.39%, Cons Disc +0.35%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing (BA) saw solid gains and outperformed the DJ after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs, who stated it has adequate liquidity to cover negative free cash flow for the year given its current cash balance and the remainder of its revolving credit facility. During hours, BA were halted as it announced its Puget Sound, Washington, factory (which holds nearly half of its global workforce) is to halt production for two weeks and start reducing capacity from Monday, although it will continue to pay those who work from home and will pay 10 days sick leave for those who do not. Hasbro (HAS) saw solid gains after up-beat comments from its CEO noting its financial position is very good and it does not expect to make any layoffs, and its production partners in China are back up and running. Royal Caribbean (RCL) confirmed it has entered a USD 2.2bln, 1-year secure term loan facility and has over USD 3.6bln of liquidity composed of cash deposits and existing undrawn revolving credit facilities. Macy's Inc. (M) withdrew its FY20 guidance and suspended its regularly quarterly cash dividend while drawing down USD 1.5bln from its revolving credit facility; VF Corp (VFC) also withdrew guidance. Kohl’s (KSS) debt was downgraded to BBB; outlook negative from BBB; outlook stable. Nike (NKE) traded lower ahead of earnings tomorrow after PT cuts from Needham &amp; Piper to USD 80/shr and USD 82/shr, respectively, (Friday close @ 67.45/shr) as both desks lower its earnings estimates for FY21. Microchip (MCHP) saw solid gains after it announced a restructuring of a small amount of its debt, which led to a positive commentary from CSFB &amp; Wells Fargo.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>EZ CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (MAR): </strong>While flash Eurozone consumer confidence fell by less than feared (-11.6, expected -14.2, previous -6.6), only 15% of consumer responses were collected, given that confinement measures implemented in the bloc's countries, making it somewhat difficult to draw any firm conclusions. Analysts noted that at -11.6 points, the indicator for the euro area was now below its long-term average of -11.0.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> An initial down day for the dollar as the Fed expanded its QE programme to USD 75bln a day on treasury purchases and USD 50bln a day on MBS which desks are labelling as ‘unlimited QE’ as the Fed notes it is to continue purchases “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy”. Although DXY remains above 102 after a low of 101.64, lower yields and a disagreement on the coronavirus bill is limiting upside as the Senate failed to pass its second procedural vote. Schumer last night stated he believes it can be resolved within 24 hours which would be welcomed, notes ING, although after the second failure Senate Majority Leader McConnell stated the delays could push the stimulus package to Friday. The dollar index, however, clawed back its Fed-induced losses as demand for dollars remains elevated although has eased somewhat while SocGen analysts suggest the recent gains in the buck are likely to hold, at least for a few days and ING believes the Federal reserve will find the tools to help with USD liquidity but expects the buck “may stay tight this week”. Looking ahead, This Thursday's jobless claims data are, arguably, one of the most important in the history of the series; last week, claims jumped to 280k; for the week ending 21st March, and are seen spiking to 750k this week -- which would top the all-time high 695k in Oct/1982 -- although the street thinks the print could be anywhere between 250k to 3mln. The market's reaction to the data will partly depend on what sort of coronavirus bill policymakers pass, and how much support it contains for Americans, as well as other measures to backstop the economy amid the coronavirus shutdown.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Firmer against the buck today as the cross briefly reclaimed 1.08 to the upside boosted by weakness in the greenback after the Fed’s QE expansion while Germany approved a EUR 750bln coronavirus package. Gains in the single currency, however, tailed off amid a rebound in the buck in afternoon trade as demand for dollars continues; EURUSD remains marginally firmer on the day. ING note it cannot rule out a downwards extension on EURUSD to 1.05 this week but believes once market dislocation is fixed the cross should regain 1.10 to the upside.&nbsp; Technicians see 1.0839 (23.6% fib of 1.1495-1.0636 fall in March) as key to the upside, though shorts will look to get involved at 1.0825. Tuesday's flash PMIs are in focus; the survey is usually carried out in the second half of the month, with the 'flash' data typically collecting data within approximately one week of the release (which this month corresponds to the French and Spanish announcing lockdowns). Analysts expect the flash PMI headlines may see 'the sharpest fall on record', but there will also be attention on the forward-looking measures. Additionally, analysts compare the severity of the economic disruptions in Italy and Spain against the rest of Europe (which will be made somewhat tricky since Italy isn't included in the 'flash' data), and will be watching for evidence of supply chain disruptions beyond those related to factory shutdowns in China.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> Tokyo 2020 organisers are reportedly considering a delay with Veteran Dick Pound suggesting a delay until 2021 as a possibility. Nevertheless, JPY started the week on the front foot amid risk-off sentiment, equities sliding, and yields falling. The 109.62 level is key (76.4% of 112.23 to 101.18 fall), a level USDJPY has closed above for the previous two sessions; technicians say it opens the door to 112.23 (20th Feb high). Some desks have talked about going long on dips to 109.70. In today’s trade USDJPY fell as low as 109.70 before rebounding throughout the rest of the session where the JPY lost ground and the cross reached highs of 111.60.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable saw highs of 1.1740 before a rebound back to the 1.15 mark before the announcement from the Federal Reserve which provided support to the cross back up to 1.1680. Desks highlighted a tightening in the GBP, JPY and EUR currency basis swaps following the announcement, showing signs of reduced funding pressures. The bounce, however, was shortlived for Cable as it fell through 1.15 in afternoon trade as dollar regained some losses and after comments from UK PM Johnson urged citizens to listen to advice or risk more “draconian measures”, however the cross pared somewhat and now remains around the level after the procedural vote in the Senate failed once again. Analysts do note that further weakness in sterling is not out of the question with the coronavirus in early stages and a drop towards 1.10 is not ruled out. Note, aftermarket UK PM Johnson is set to provide an update at 16:30 ET / 20:30 GMT on how to tackle the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> RBNZ announced NZD 30bln govt bond purchases programme, representing about half of the available stock of bonds. The Government is set for more issuance this year to fund its NZD 12bln fiscal support programme. Westpac said that, at around 10% of annual GDP, the programme was of a similar size to QE in other nations during the GFC, which were effective in bringing longer-term interest rates down. But Westpac says it still does not change its forecast of a 3.1% decline in GDP, but the measures will prevent an even worse outcome. The kiwi initially was hit on the RBNZ’s NZD QE programme where NZDUSD found support at the 0.56 handle before bouncing back above 0.57 in wake of the Feds QE expansion, a level it resided around heading into overnight trade.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The Australian government added AUD 66.4bln of stimulus, and also stepped-up lockdown measures. Aussie regulators said they would be announcing further plans to reduce the burden facing banks. AUD volatility has also picked-up notably within G10, making it expensive for traders to protect against Aussie swings. AUDUSD was fairly contained between 0.57-0.5844 ahead of the March PMI’s later tonight.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie could not vault the 2016 high at 1.4690, which technicians suggest points to some exhaustion after the ~10% rally in USDCAD this month. Canadian bank RBC sees initial resistance at 1.4536 and 1.4600, a warns that a return below support at 1.4103 would add more weight to the exhaustion thesis, with secondary support at 1.4014.</p><p><strong>CNY:</strong> PBOC Deputy Governor Chen expects to see USDCNY remaining around 7.00 in the near-term. Chen on the weekend called for increased global policy coordination. Spot yuan closed onshore trade at the weakest since October 2019, at 7.1187 vs the USD.</p><p><strong>NOK:</strong> The Norwegian Krona outperformed counterparts despite the initial weakness in the crude complex, although WTI &amp; Brent both settled firmer due to a pre-settlement rally. EURNOK remained off lows heading into overnight trade within the 12.0460 – 12.742 parameters.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was mixed with RUB faring stronger against the buck benefitting from a pre-energy settlement rally in the crude complex, although USDRUB still remains elevated just beneath the 80.00 figure. MXN continued to weaken after the emergency 50bp rate cut from Banxico on Friday, while the BRL also weaker amid the BCB minutes which stated it will use all tools available in monetary, financial and exchange policy to face the current crisis.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>USD:</strong> An initial down day for the dollar as the Fed expanded its QE programme to USD 75bln a day on treasury purchases and USD 50bln a day on MBS which desks are labelling as ‘unlimited QE’ as the Fed notes it is to continue purchases “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy”. Although DXY remains above 102 after a low of 101.64, lower yields and disagreement on the coronavirus bill are limiting upside as the Senate failed to pass its second procedural vote. Schumer last night stated he believes it can be resolved within 24 hours which would be welcomed, notes ING, although after the second failure Senate Majority Leader McConnell stated the delays could push the stimulus package to Friday. The dollar index, however, clawed back its Fed-induced losses as demand for dollars remains elevated although has eased somewhat while SocGen analysts suggest the recent gains in the buck are likely to hold, at least for a few days and ING believes the Federal reserve will find the tools to help with USD liquidity but expects the buck “may stay tight this week”. Looking ahead, This Thursday's jobless claims data are, arguably, one of the most important in the history of the series; last week, claims jumped to 280k; for the week ending 21st March, and are seen spiking to 750k this week -- which would top the all-time high 695k in Oct/1982 -- although the street thinks the print could be anywhere between 250k to 3mln. The market's reaction to the data will partly depend on what sort of coronavirus bill policymakers pass, and how much support it contains for Americans, as well as other measures to backstop the economy amid the coronavirus shutdown.</li><li><strong>EUR:</strong> An outperformer against the buck today as the cross briefly reclaimed 1.08 to the upside boosted by weakness in the greenback after the Fed’s QE expansion while Germany approved a EUR 750bln coronavirus package. Gains in the single currency, however, tailed off amid a rebound in the buck in afternoon trade as demand for dollars continues; EURUSD remains marginally firmer on the day. ING note it cannot rule out a downwards extension on EURUSD to 1.05 this week but believes once market dislocation is fixed the cross should regain 1.10 to the upside.&nbsp; Technicians see 1.0839 (23.6% fib of 1.1495-1.0636 fall in March) as key to the upside, though shorts will look to get involved at 1.0825. Tuesday's flash PMIs are in focus; the survey is usually carried out in the second half of the month, with the 'flash' data typically collecting data within approximately one week of the release (which this month corresponds to the French and Spanish announcing lockdowns). Analysts expect the flash PMI headlines may see 'the sharpest fall on record', but there will also be attention on the forward-looking measures. Additionally, analysts compare the severity of the economic disruptions in Italy and Spain against the rest of Europe (which will be made somewhat tricky since Italy isn't included in the 'flash' data) and will be watching for evidence of supply chain disruptions beyond those related to factory shutdowns in China.</li><li><strong>JPY:</strong> Tokyo 2020 organisers are reportedly considering a delay with Veteran Dick Pound suggesting a delay until 2021 as a possibility. Nevertheless, JPY started the week on the front foot amid risk-off sentiment, equities sliding, and yields falling. The 109.62 level is key (76.4% of 112.23 to 101.18 fall), a level USDJPY has closed above for the previous two sessions; technicians say it opens the door to 112.23 (20th Feb high). Some desks have talked about going long on dips to 109.70. In today’s trade USDJPY fell as low as 109.70 before rebounding throughout the rest of the session where the JPY lost ground and the cross reached highs of 111.60.</li><li><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable saw highs of 1.1740 before a rebound back to the 1.15 mark before the announcement from the Federal Reserve which provided support to the cross back up to 1.1680. Desks highlighted a tightening in the GBP, JPY and EUR currency basis swaps following the announcement, showing signs of reduced funding pressures. However, the bounce was shortlived for Cable as it fell through 1.15 in afternoon trade as the dollar regained some losses and after comments from UK PM Johnson urged citizens to listen to advice or risk more “draconian measures”, although the cross pared somewhat and now remains around the level after the procedural vote in the Senate failed once again. Analysts do note that further weakness in sterling is not out of the question with the coronavirus in early stages and a drop towards 1.10 is not ruled out. Note, aftermarket UK PM Johnson is set to provide an update at 16:30 ET / 20:30 GMT on how to tackle the coronavirus.</li><li><strong>NZD:</strong> RBNZ announced NZD 30bln govt bond purchases programme, representing about half of the available stock of bonds. The Government is set for more issuance this year to fund its NZD 12bln fiscal support programme. Westpac said that, at around 10% of annual GDP, the programme was of a similar size to QE in other nations during the GFC, which were effective in bringing longer-term interest rates down. But Westpac says it still does not change its forecast of a 3.1% decline in GDP, but the measures will prevent an even worse outcome. The kiwi initially was hit on the RBNZ’s NZD QE programme where NZDUSD found support at the 0.56 handle before bouncing back above 0.57 in wake of the Feds QE expansion, a level it resided around heading into overnight trade.</li><li><strong>AUD:</strong> The Australian government added AUD 66.4bln of stimulus, and also stepped-up lockdown measures. Aussie regulators said they would be announcing further plans to reduce the burden facing banks. AUD volatility has also picked-up notably within G10, making it expensive for traders to protect against Aussie swings. AUDUSD was fairly contained between 0.57-0.5844 ahead of the March PMI’s later tonight.</li><li><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie could not vault the 2016 high at 1.4690, which technicians suggest points to some exhaustion after the ~10% rally in USDCAD this month. Canadian bank RBC sees initial resistance at 1.4536 and 1.4600 and warns that a return below support at 1.4103 would add more weight to the exhaustion thesis, with secondary support at 1.4014.</li><li><strong>CNY:</strong> PBOC Deputy Governor Chen expects to see USDCNY remaining around 7.00 in the near-term. Chen on the weekend called for increased global policy coordination. Spot yuan closed onshore trade at the weakest since October 2019, at 7.1187 vs the USD.</li><li><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was mixed with RUB faring stronger against the buck benefitting from a pre-energy settlement rally in the crude complex, although USDRUB still remains elevated just beneath the 80.00 figure. MXN continued to weaken after the emergency 50bp rate cut from Banxico on Friday, while the BRL also weaker amid the BCB minutes which stated it will use all tools available in monetary, financial and exchange policy to face the current crisis.</li></ul>",

Over the weekend, comments from Russia speaking to Tass stated Russia did not look for an end to cooperation with OPEC, nor the sudden fall in oil prices, putting the blame on to the Gulf nations, once again suggesting no sign of easing between the two sides. &nbsp;Energy Minister Novak reportedly met with oil companies today but there was no mention of the price war, according to Energy Intel, who also stated there would be no talks of production cuts. Elsewhere in Russia, it has reportedly agreed to increase the discount for its oil supplies to Belarus by USD 12/tonne to USD 15.7/tonne, but Belarus is yet to say how much oil it will purchase, according to sources. Meanwhile in Saudi, crude oil exports averaged 7.2-7.3mln BPD for March so far, according to Tanker Trackers, which is relatively unchanged from February despite previous reports suggesting the Kingdom would increase its exports to 10mln BPD. Elsewhere, two vessels scheduled to export 2.9mln bbls of Venezuelan crude have been delayed, Kuwait is taking all steps necessary to ensure production continues (Kuwait was producing 2.66mln BPD at the end of February), and Libya’s NOC announced it is to reduce staffing at its oil fields and ports, all due to the coronavirus, which has seen oil giants Shell (RDSA.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Buck bulls have been thwarted again by Fed policy action, but this time on QE grounds rather than swap lines designed to easy liquidity strains as US Treasury and MBS purchases are ramped up to Usd125.bn on a daily basis this week in an open-ended buying program from an initial Usd700 bn tranche to combat the adverse impact of COVID-19. The <strong>DXY </strong>looked all set to revisit and potentially surpass last Friday’s near 103.00 pinnacle before the announcement, but subsequently slipped back below 102.00 and is now attempting to regroup again awaiting news from Washington on fiscal stimulus.</p><p><strong>NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona is off best levels, though still head and shoulders above G10 counterparts irrespective of renewed weakness in crude prices that have taken a toll on the likes of the Canadian Dollar, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso, albeit the latter also caught off guard by Banxico’s 50 bp emergency rate cut last Friday. Eur/Nok has retreated further from around 12.7400 through 12.1500 in contrast to Usd/<strong>CAD</strong> now back up over 1.4500, Usd/<strong>RUB</strong> at 80.0000+ and Usd/<strong>MXN</strong> hitting a new 25.2560 or so ATH.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has lost more recovery momentum in the run up to UK PM Johnson’s daily nCoV update amidst speculation that containment measures could be tightened again given many citizens flouting firm advice to stay indoors or to stick strictly to distancing guidelines if venturing out. Latest word in certain media circles suggest that all non-essential shops will be ordered to close, and the next step would be a blanket lockdown. Cable is back down under 1.1500 from 1.1730+ and almost 1.1900 at one stage last Friday, while Eur/Gbp has now rebounded above 0.9350 vs sub-0.9150 earlier.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi have both pared some declines vs their US rival , but remain on the backfoot on coronavirus contagion between 0.5844-0.5702 and 0.5736-0.5596 respective parameters ahead of March PMIs and after RBNZ QE.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>The Euro and Franc have emerged from choppy Monday sessions to hold gains vs the Buck around 1.0740 and 0.9830, but the Yen has unwound all and more of its safe-haven premium to test support and underlying bids at 111.50 following headlines suggesting that a supplementary budget may be approved by May 1st. Note, preliminary Eurozone consumer sentiment deteriorated sharply, but not as much as it might have done if more than 15% filed their responses after pandemic containment measures were rolled out.</p>",

The announcement initially saw US equity futures enter positive territory, although since the open all gains were lost and futures join cash and trade in the red. Boeing (BA) is leading gains in the Dow after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs, who stated it has adequate liquidity to cover negative free cash flow for the year given its current cash balance and the remainder of its revolving credit facility.

The legislation involved would have amounted to around USD 2trl vs. the touted USD 1trl last week; includes around USD 1.3-1.4trl of spending with the remainder coming in the form of loans that would eventually be paid back. Senate Democrats were reportedly sending signals to Republicans on the need to revise the bill while negotiations continue. Following the defeat, <strong>US Senate Majority Leader McConnell initially said the Senate will re-vote on the motion to proceed at 0945EDT on Monday</strong>, <strong>although reports later noted that this will be later than previously planned as the Senate is to return at 1200EDT</strong>, while Senate Democratic Leader Schumer believes coronavirus bill issues can be resolved in next 24 hours.

(Newswires/JiJi)</p><h2>ASIA</h2><p><strong>Asian stock markets mostly traded with hefty losses amid further coronavirus-related disruptions and a rising death toll</strong>. As such, risk sentiment was spooked which was exacerbated as US equity futures hit limit down within a matter of minutes from the open to set the gloomy tone across the Asia-Pac region with <strong>ASX 200 (-5.6%)</strong> weighed heavily amid double digit losses across the big 4 banks and with <strong>NZX 50 (-7.6%) </strong>registering its worst intraday drop on record of more than 10% after the announcement of shutdown measures. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-4.9%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-3.1%)</strong> were lower as China conformed to the global coronavirus fears and after continued PBoC liquidity inaction. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+2.0%)</strong> bucked the trend on return from its extended weekend and with some finding comfort after Japanese PM Abe ruled out the cancellation of the Olympics but was instead open to a postponement, while SoftBank shares surged on the announcement of a JPY 4.5tln asset sale to fund a share buyback in which the Co. will retire 45% of stock. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the predominantly negative overnight risk tone and with the BoJ also present in the market today which includes unscheduled purchases of JPY 300bln in 3-5yr and JPY 500bln in 5yr-10yr JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

With three cited options: ESM credit lines, narrow liquidity facilities for emergency health-care and introduction of coronabonds. (FT)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Another detrimental start to the week for European equities (Euro Stoxx 50 -3.0%), as the negative APAC sentiment reverberated to Europe after US Senate failed to reach the required number of votes to pass its coronavirus bill, although Senate Majority Leader McConnel stated that a re-vote of the motion will proceed 15 minutes after the US Cash open. US equity futures briefly hit the 5% limit down but clambered off lows, whilst major European bourses experience broad-based losses, with the DAX having briefly lost the 8500 level and the FTSE 100 south of 5000. Sectors again reside deep in negative territory, although Telecom names fare somewhat better given the increasing broadband demand as large parts of the world are forced to work from home. Travel &amp; Leisure names meanwhile see more pronounced downside on continued decaying demand. In terms of individual movers, CAC-giant Airbus (-0.4%) fell as much as 10% at the open after withdrawing FY20 guidance, pulling FY19 dividend proposals whilst it also secured a EUR 15bln credit line which will not be covered by the French government’s guarantee scheme. Elsewhere, ITV (-11.0%) sees downside after withdrawing its respective FY20 guidance whilst also announcing cost-cutting measures. Finally, Swedbank (-3.8%) sees losses relatively in-line with the broader market following a report into its money laundering practices which noted that the bank’s Estonian and Latvian arms actively pursued high-risk customers, but the report stopped short of concluding that money laundering practices took place.</p><h2>FX</h2><p><strong>USD/NZD/AUD/CAD -</strong> The Greenback has resumed its march higher after a relatively brief bout of consolidation, with the DXY back above 102.50 and aiming for a retest of resistance just below 103.00 where it faded on Friday following the Fed’s enhanced and expanded liquidity lines to other global Central Banks. However, the ensuing recovery in rival currencies has been rather short-lived as the Kiwi retreats towards 0.5600 in wake of the RBNZ rolling out a Nzd30 bn asset purchase program for 12 months, while the Aussie is back below 0.5800 alongside renewed Yuan weakness circa 7.1400 and Loonie looks destined to test 1.4500 again ahead of Canadian wholesale trade and against the backdrop of waning WTI.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP -</strong> Also unwinding corrective gains vs the US Dollar as the nCoV pandemic prompts the ECB and BoE to pledge more stimulus via additional QE and/or funding, while the latest rise in Swiss sight deposit balances reveal the extent of heightened SNB intervention to curb the Franc’s appreciation. Eur/Usd has subsequently lost grip of the 1.0700 handle, Usd/Chf is approaching 0.9900 and Cable has recoiled through 1.1600 as Eur/Gbp hovers above 0.9200 in the run up to preliminary EU PMIs on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>NOK/JPY -</strong> The G10 outperferformers, with the Norwegian Krona deriving a degree of protection from crude price erosion via heftier Norges Bank foreign currency selling, while the Yen has pared declines on renewed safe-haven demand. Eur/Nok has pulled back from 12.7400+ peaks and Usd/Jpy is meandering within a wide 111.24-109.68 band after another record amount of BoJ ETF buying and Japanese Government supplementary budget reports.</p><p><strong>SEK/EM -</strong> Risk off sentiment and the Riksbank’s QE activity are keeping Eur/Sek afloat above 10.1500, while EM currencies are broadly weaker with Usd/Mxn, Usd/Rub and Usd/Try circa 24.8660, 80.6000 and 6.6000 after the Banxico’s pre-meeting ease, in advance of Russia’s next meeting with oil companies circa 14.00GMT and as the coronavirus toll jumps in Turkey.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries are all retaining the bulk of their latest recovery gains having topped out at 171.39, 134.56 and 138-02 respectively, but the big moves in debt markets of late have been at the Eurozone margins where Spanish bonds have erased all and a bit more of their hefty declines to trade at 154.00 vs 152.71 at one stage, while Italian BTPs have popped just over 140.00 from 138.74. Nothing to substantiate the notion, but it could be that ESCB management and intervention could have kept yields/spreads from spiking/diverging further, or simply the ECB steering QE in that direction according to market conditions. Ahead, the next round BoE APF buying and EZ preliminary consumer sentiment.</p><h2>COMMODITIES</h2><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front-month futures have been unable to escape the broader market selloff in the aftermath of a roadblock in the US Senate amid a failure among lawmakers to agree on a COVID financial aid package. WTI May contract briefly slipped below the USD 21/bbl mark to levels last seen in Q1 2002, whilst similarly, its Brent counterpart dipped below USD 25/bbl to hit Q1 2003 levels. Prices continue to feel underlying pressure from parts of the global economy coming to a halt amid coronavirus lockdowns, whilst OPEC+ indecision/uncertainty only adds further pain for the complex. On that front, Russian Energy Minister Novak will be convening with Russian oil producers (1400GMT/1700 local time) to discuss the current environment and low energy prices. This meeting is key to determine Moscow’s stance in OPEC+ and will give an insight as to how much longer Russia can tolerate the continuing slide in crude prices – with the Kremlin noting at the back-end of last week that low prices are unpleasurable but not a catastrophe. Meanwhile, Energyintel’s Bakr has played down the prospect of consensus being reached on an output cut ahead of the meeting. One thing to keep an eye on will be any reaction aimed at Saudi after the Kingdom’s output hike and OSP cuts. As a reminder, Russia's government spokesperson Peskov on Friday said Moscow sees Saudi oil plan to ramp production as blackmail and will not back down but stated that the country remains ready for contact on prices. Elsewhere<strong>, spot gold</strong> continues to suffer from position liquidations as investors convert to cash/fund margins – with the yellow metal hovering below the USD 1500/oz mark ahead of last week’s USD 1451/oz low.<strong> Copper</strong> meanwhile, resumes its slide as COVID’s impact on fundamentals, supply chain and sentiment continues to pressure the red metal which hovered just above the USD 2/lb mark, having dipped below the figure last week.</p><p>Energyintel's Bakr states that there are currently no signs that Russian Energy Minister and Russian energy companies will be talking about production cuts. (Twitter)</p><h2>US</h2><p><strong>Fed's Kashkari (Voter, Dove)</strong> said the US will at least have a mild recession and that that the Fed will ensure banks have enough cash to meet demand. Kashkari also stated the Fed is being very aggressive but there is more we can do if needed and that the Fed has infinite cash to support the financial system. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Bullard (non-voter, dove)</strong> reiterated that the Fed was willing to do more to help address the coronavirus crisis and warned that unless more was fiscally done, unemployment could reach 30% in Q2 due to virus shutdowns, while he also suggested that GDP could decline greater than 50%.

Finally, Swedbank (-3.8%) sees losses relatively in-line with the broader market following a report into its money laundering practices which noted that the bank’s Estonian and Latvian arms actively pursued high-risk customers, but the report stopped short of concluding that money laundering practices took place.</p><p><strong>FX</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD/NZD/AUD/CAD</strong> - The Greenback has resumed its march higher after a relatively brief bout of consolidation, with the DXY back above 102.50 and aiming for a retest of resistance just below 103.00 where it faded on Friday following the Fed’s enhanced and expanded liquidity lines to other global Central Banks. However, the ensuing recovery in rival currencies has been rather short-lived as the Kiwi retreats towards 0.5600 in wake of the RBNZ rolling out a Nzd30 bn asset purchase program for 12 months, while the Aussie is back below 0.5800 alongside renewed Yuan weakness circa 7.1400 and Loonie looks destined to test 1.4500 again ahead of Canadian wholesale trade and against the backdrop of waning WTI.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP</strong> - Also unwinding corrective gains vs the US Dollar as the nCoV pandemic prompts the ECB and BoE to pledge more stimulus via additional QE and/or funding, while the latest rise in Swiss sight deposit balances reveal the extent of heightened SNB intervention to curb the Franc’s appreciation. Eur/Usd has subsequently lost grip of the 1.0700 handle, Usd/Chf is approaching 0.9900 and Cable has recoiled through 1.1600 as Eur/Gbp hovers above 0.9200 in the run up to preliminary EU PMIs on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>NOK/JPY </strong>- The G10 outperferformers, with the Norwegian Krona deriving a degree of protection from crude price erosion via heftier Norges Bank foreign currency selling, while the Yen has pared declines on renewed safe-haven demand. Eur/Nok has pulled back from 12. - 7400+ peaks and Usd/Jpy is meandering within a wide 111.24-109.68 band after another record amount of BoJ ETF buying and Japanese Government supplementary budget reports.</p><p><strong>SEK/EM</strong> - Risk off sentiment and the Riksbank’s QE activity are keeping Eur/Sek afloat above 10.1500, while EM currencies are broadly weaker with Usd/Mxn, Usd/Rub and Usd/Try circa 24.8660, 80.6000 and 6.6000 after the Banxico’s pre-meeting ease, in advance of Russia’s next meeting with oil companies circa 14.00GMT and as the coronavirus toll jumps in Turkey.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong>,<strong> Gilts</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are all retaining the bulk of their latest recovery gains having topped out at 171.39, 134.56 and 138-02 respectively, but the big moves in debt markets of late have been at the Eurozone margins where Spanish bonds have erased all and a bit more of their hefty declines to trade at 154.00 vs 152.71 at one stage, while Italian BTPs have popped just over 140.00 from 138.74. Nothing to substantiate the notion, but it could be that ESCB management and intervention could have kept yields/spreads from spiking/diverging further, or simply the ECB steering QE in that direction according to market conditions. Ahead, the next round BoE APF buying and EZ preliminary consumer sentiment.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures have been unable to escape the broader market selloff in the aftermath of a roadblock in the US Senate amid a failure among lawmakers to agree on a COVID financial aid package. <strong>WTI</strong> May contract briefly slipped below the USD 21/bbl mark to levels last seen in Q1 2002, whilst similarly, its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart dipped below USD 25/bbl to hit Q1 2003 levels. Prices continue to feel underlying pressure from parts of the global economy coming to a halt amid coronavirus lockdowns, whilst OPEC+ indecision/uncertainty only adds further pain for the complex. <strong>On that front, Russian Energy Minister Novak will be convening with Russian oil producers (1400GMT/1700 local time)</strong> to discuss the current environment and low energy prices. This meeting is key to determine Moscow’s stance in OPEC+ and will give an insight as to how much longer Russia can tolerate the continuing slide in crude prices – with the Kremlin noting at the back-end of last week that low prices are unpleasurable but not a catastrophe. Meanwhile, Energyintel’s Bakr has played down the prospect of consensus being reached on an output cut ahead of the meeting. One thing to keep an eye on will be any reaction aimed at Saudi after the Kingdom’s output hike and OSP cuts. As a reminder, Russia's government spokesperson Peskov on Friday said Moscow sees Saudi oil plan to ramp production as blackmail and will not back down but stated that the country remains ready for contact on prices. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> continues to suffer from position liquidations as investors convert to cash/fund margins – with the yellow metal hovering below the USD 1500/oz mark ahead of last week’s USD 1451/oz low. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile, resumes its slide as COVID’s impact on fundamentals, supply chain and sentiment continues to pressure the red metal which hovered just above the USD 2/lb mark, having dipped below the figure last week.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian stock markets mostly traded with hefty losses following the worst week on Wall St since the global financial crisis and amid further coronavirus-related disruptions including the UK which announced a nationwide shutdown including restaurants, pubs and clubs, while New York and New Jersey also recently issued stay at home orders in an attempt to curb the spread of the deadly outbreak. As such, risk sentiment was spooked which was exacerbated as US equity futures hit limit down within a matter of minutes from the open to set the gloomy tone across the Asia-Pac region with ASX 200 (-5.6%) weighed heavily amid double digit losses across the big 4 banks and with NZX 50 (-6.6%) registering its worst intraday drop on record of more than 10% after the announcement of shutdown measures. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-4.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.7%) were lower as China conformed to the global coronavirus fears and after continued PBoC liquidity inaction, although not all was doom and gloom with Li &amp; Fung shares almost doubling after it received an offer to go private valued at a 150% premium. Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) also bucked the trend on return from its extended weekend and with some finding comfort after Japanese PM Abe ruled out the cancellation of the Olympics but was instead open to a postponement, while SoftBank shares surged on the announcement of a JPY 4.5tln asset sale to fund a share buyback in which the Co. will retire 45% of stock. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the predominantly negative overnight risk tone and with the BoJ also present in the market today which includes unscheduled purchases of JPY 300bln in 3-5yr and JPY 500bln in 5yr-10yr JGBs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian stock markets mostly trade with hefty losses following the worst week on Wall St since the global financial crisis and amid further coronavirus-related disruptions including the UK which announced a nationwide shutdown including restaurants, pubs and clubs, while New York and New Jersey also recently issued stay at home orders in an attempt to curb the spread of the deadly outbreak. As such, risk sentiment was spooked which saw US equity futures hit limit down within a matter of minutes from the open to set the gloomy tone across the Asia-Pac region with ASX 200 (-5.9%) weighed heavily amid double digit losses across the big 4 banks and with NZX 50 (-8.3%) registering its worst intraday drop on record of more than 10% after both governments also announced shutdown measures. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.1%) are lower as China conforms to the global coronavirus fears and after continued PBoC liquidity inaction, although not all was doom and gloom with Li &amp; Fung shares almost doubling after it received an offer to go private valued at a 150% premium, while Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) bucked the trend on return from its extended weekend and with some finding comfort after Japanese PM Abe ruled out the cancellation of the Olympics but was instead open to a postponement.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY continues to retreat from resistance near the 103.00 level as it reverses some of last week’s stellar gains, with price action not helped after the coronavirus relief bill failed to get enough votes to pass through the first procedural hurdle at the Senate amid ongoing negotiations, although there will be another attempt on Monday morning. The pullback in USD provided some reprieve for its transatlantic peers in which EUR/USD rebounded from its lowest since 2017 to reclaim the 1.0700 handle and with GBP/USD unchanged around 1.1650 as it takes a breather from the recent sell-off which saw the pair slump to its weakest since 1985. Elsewhere, USD/JPY tests 110.00 to the downside and JPY-crosses are pressured on the broad safe-haven flows, while antipodeans are weighed on the risk averse tone and following lockdown announcements on both sides of the Tasman, with NZD also pressured from the recent RBNZ announcement of a NZD 30bln large scale asset purchase programme.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the predominantly negative overnight risk tone and with the BoJ also present in the market today which includes unscheduled purchases of JPY 300bln in 3-5yr and JPY 500bln in 5yr-10yr JGBs.</p>",
