The rally got a boost around midday when Fed Funds futures began pricing negative rates in the US from December 2020, however, action once stalled after failing to vault the crucial 2,900; the negative ticks were given some impetus after headlines noted that the Senate had failed to override a Trump veto of the resolution limiting his abilities to declare a war on Iran, however, the timing may have been a coincidence, since crude didn’t catch a bid on the headline, which one would expect amid increasing geopolitical tensions. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) comparable SSS -4.7% in April. Liberty Global (LBTYA) and Telefonica (TEF) announced an agreement to merge its UK business to create a 50:50 JV. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) (Information Technology/Software) has reportedly been made accessible to teachers by the NYC education department after the DoE withdrew its ban on the app. Tesla (TSLA) has halted production at its Chinese factory. It is also worth noting CEO Musk will be appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast again; last time TSLA stock was hit after he smoked marijuana on the show. TSLA is also reportedly planning to restart production at its Fremont, California factory. Moderna (MRNA) is finalising the protocol for its Phase 3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine MRNA-1273 and is expected to begin in early summer in 2020. Elsewhere, NIH Dr. Fauci highlighted the vaccine candidate, as well as Oxford University’s, accompanied by comments he expects the US to have a vaccine as soon as January. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Kohl’s (KSS) are to reopen select stores across the US. SPX +1.2% at 2881, NDX +1.3% at 9102, DJIA +0.9% at 23,876.</p><p>The TPLEX was heavily bid on Thursday, reversing all of the losses incurred after Wednesday’s bazooka refunding announcement. The short-end was particularly sought, where Fed Funds futures began pricing US negative rates in December out. By settlement, 2s -5bps at 0.13%, 5s -8bps at 0.30%, 10s 9bps at 0.63%, 30s -10bps at 1.31%. The grind lower in yields got going as the US session got underway, having risen in APAC and early European trade. There was no new/immediate catalyst for the strength, although desks note the likelihood of participants seizing the rate back-up from Wednesday in anticipation that the Fed would not let the UST curve continue to steepen. Tomorrow’s weekly Fed purchases schedule will be key for gauging the Fed’s tolerance for curve steepening, where it has up to now been tapering its weekly purchases, albeit at a declining rate each week; Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe the two most likely scenarios are either a lowering to USD 30bln per week, or to be maintained at USD 40bln per week, which if the former, the bank expects a steepening of the curve amid the supply/demand dynamic becoming “unfavourable”, while the latter would see little reaction. The TPLEX also continued to rally in the face of record corporate issuance – IFR noted this week marked the third largest for supply ever – where over ten IG issuers came to the dollar market today, including CVX, which is still to announce the size and pricing of its announced seven-parter. US T-note futures (M0) settled 24 ticks higher at 139-09+.</p>",

The rally got a boost around midday when Fed Funds futures began pricing negative rates in the US from December 2020, however, action once stalled after failing to vault the crucial 2,900; the negative ticks were given some impetus after headlines noted that the Senate had failed to override a Trump veto of the resolution limiting his abilities to declare a war on Iran, however, the timing may have been a coincidence, since crude didn’t catch a bid on the headline, which one would expect amid increasing geopolitical tensions.&nbsp; In the Treasury complex, yesterday’s refunding-induced jump higher in yields was pared back, with some suggesting that the afternoon moves may have come following supportive remarks from ECB President Lagarde, which helped the FI complex; others noted that Japanese players had returned, and Wednesday’s rise in yields may have enticed buyers; others, meanwhile, suggested it may be technical in nature. Elsewhere, crude was lower, unable to cling to gains. The dollar ended a three-day run of higher closes, while gold jumped as real rates were squashed. The market was happy to look through weekly jobless claims data since the narrative has been so heavily discounted. Fedspeak was again repetitive, although we will be paying extra attention to commentary on negative rates in the days ahead, given the implications of market pricing; some desks suggest that the Fed will have to address negative rates very quickly or risk falling into a self-fulfilling dynamic, and having to implement aggressive, hawkish commentary down the road.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> This morning sources reports noted the two sides will conduct a phone call among top trade chiefs regarding the progress in implementing the Phase One trade deal. USTR Lighthizer and his Chinese counterpart Liu He will partake in the call, and this will be the first time the two sides hold discussions since January. The trade deal calls for the two negotiators to convene every six months, therefore this call will be taking place ahead of schedule. The call comes amid a backdrop of punchy rhetoric from the US who have threatened tariffs if the Phase One trade agreement is not met, a condition mentioned when the deal was signed. Overnight, the trade data saw trade with US continued to decline in Q1 with the total value of China US-trade -12.8%, while imports from the US fell 3%, and exports down 15.9%, Global Times highlighted. However, editor in Chief, Hu Xijin, later noted China is seriously implementing the Phase One deal with purchases of US soybeans +210% in Q1, although the pandemic would inevitably influence the schedule.</p><p><strong>US STIMULUS:</strong> US President Trump noted it is possible the administration will come up with further economic measures to help the people, where earlier source reports noted the White House is considering actions it could take to stimulate the economy without requiring legislation, adding it is mulling a delay in the tax filing deadline to September 15th from July, or even back to December, NBC reported.</p><p><strong>REOPENING:</strong> Nevada is set to reopen on May 15th, while the Michigan Governor is reportedly set to announce the reopening of its manufacturing sector starting from as early as next week. Elsewhere, stores are slowly starting to return with Kohl’s (KSS) starting to resume operations in 10 states from May 11th, Gap (GPS) set to reopen 800 stores from this weekend, while Macy’s (M), Best Buy (BBY) and Nordstrom (JWN) are also looking towards a reopening shortly. Analysts are keeping an eye on the positive linearity of the reopening and will be paying close attention to sales figures and guidance in comparison to pre-COVID levels.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>BOE:</strong> The BoE opted to stand pat on rates at the “effective lower bound” of 0.1%, as expected; the decision was unanimous. Bond purchases were also held at the current envelope of GBP 645bln (GBP 625bln Gilts, GBP 20bln corporates), however, policymakers were split 7-2 on this decision, with Haskell and Saunders pushing for a GBP 100bln increase. Heading into the announcement, ING noted that purchases remain below the current ceiling of GBP 645bln and will likely remain so for another two months; i.e the Bank need not rush into making a decision at this stage. This view was reflected in the MPC’s statement, with members noting that existing policy was “appropriate” but the Bank stood ready to “take further action as is necessary to support the economy”. Furthermore, in a follow-up interview, Governor Bailey noted that the Bank “could do more QE in June”. Interestingly, in the same interview, the Governor refused to rule out negative rates, but noted that “discussions have a long way to go”. In terms of the findings of the Monetary Policy Report, the MPC’s central scenario (predicated upon a gradual unwinding of lockdown measures by the end of Q3), policymakers look for GDP to contract by 14% this year before rebounding by 15% in 2021. More specifically, “activity picks up materially in the latter part of 2020 and into 2021 after social distancing measures are relaxed, although it does not reach its pre‑COVID level until the second half of 2021”. Some desks viewed this as a potential over-optimistic view for the UK’s economic outlook; ING does not expect the UK economy to recover lost ground until at least 2022, and perhaps later. Furthermore, little reference was made to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU; another likely headwind to the economy. Additionally, some eyebrows were raised over the 8% unemployment forecast for 2020 despite almost a quarter or the private working population being supported by the government’s working scheme, which is due to be curtailed at some point. Overall, the BoE did not feel compelled to act at this meeting, albeit an adjustment to the Bank’s QE remit seems likely. What comes thereafter remains to be seen, however, any further deterioration in the UK economy will likely lead to a revision to the current planning scenarios on Threadneedle St.</p><p><strong>NORGES: </strong>Norges Bank defied consensus and cut rates by 25bp to a record low 0.0% in a unanimous decision, as well as announcing the provision of further F-loans; given the downbeat domestic outlook which has been exacerbated by the oil market turmoil. Going into the meeting expectations were almost unanimously in favour of the decision being unchanged given the 125bp worth of easing during the COVID-19 crisis taken prior to the 25bp cut. The surprise move lower prompted significant weakness in the NOK; however, this was somewhat short-lived as Governor Olsen’s meeting remarks highlighted that rates are expected to remain unchanged at this period for the horizon ahead. It’s worth noting, that in slight contrast to this, Olsen commented that NIRP is a possibility; albeit, a very unlikely one – which isn’t too surprising given the well know reservations amongst the Norges Bank’s Governing Council to negative rates. Within the Monetary Policy Update, it was revealed that the Bank has undertaken NOK 3.5bln worth of extraordinary NOK purchases in the month of March – no details on April – to support proper market function; also, emphasising that they have no perception on EUR/NOK itself. Looking ahead, two sets of alternative forecasts have been released due to the unusually high levels of uncertainty the first ‘Alternative 1’ is based on the assumption that activity rapidly picks up faster than the baseline forecasts and sees rates gradually increase at the end of the projection period. While ‘Alternative 2’ is predicated on the domestic downturn being deeper and longer than the baseline, and sees rates at ‘close to zero’ throughout the projection timeframe; even with substantial fiscal support.</p><p><strong>BCB: </strong>The Brazilian central bank cut rates by 75bps, taking the Selic rate to 3.00%; the move was deeper than the analyst consensus (-50bps) and money market pricing (around -60bps). The central bank said that the COVID-19 impact was deeper than expected. It also considered a rate cut for its next meeting that would not exceed this month’s move (75bps), with the argument of how much to lower the Selic hinging on fiscal policy and reforms. “We expect the curve to bull steepen as the market prices in the terminal rate to be 2.25-2.50% in line with BCB’s guidance,” Morgan Stanley said, “in addition, we also anticipate front-end DI outperformance as markets price in lower rates for longer, especially as two members explicitly suggested the introduction of forward guidance to enhance the stimulus.” In terms of the impact for the currency, MS expects BRL to continuing underperforming as the BCB pushes monetary policy to its limits.</p><p><strong>ECB</strong> President Lagarde said the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament and are driven by its mandate alone – coming amid the ramp up of tension between German policymakers and the central bank.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 24 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-09+.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX was heavily bid on Thursday, reversing all of the losses incurred after Wednesday’s bazooka refunding announcement. The short-end was particularly sought, where Fed Funds futures began pricing US negative rates in December out. By settlement, 2s -5bps at 0.13%, 5s -8bps at 0.30%, 10s 9bps at 0.63%, 30s -10bps at 1.31%. The grind lower in yields got going as the US session got underway, having risen in APAC and early European trade. There was no new/immediate catalyst for the strength, although desks note the likelihood of participants seizing the rate back-up from Wednesday in anticipation that the Fed would not let the UST curve continue to steepen. Tomorrow’s weekly Fed purchases schedule will be key for gauging the Fed’s tolerance for curve steepening, where it has up to now been tapering its weekly purchases, albeit at a declining rate each week; Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe the two most likely scenarios are either a lowering to USD 30bln per week, or to be maintained at USD 40bln per week, which if the former, the bank expects a steepening of the curve amid the supply/demand dynamic becoming “unfavourable”, while the latter would see little reaction. The TPLEX also continued to rally in the face of record corporate issuance – IFR noted this week marked the third largest for supply ever – where over ten IG issuers came to the dollar market today, including CVX, which is still to announce the size and pricing of its announced seven-parter.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong> the speculation around negative interest rates in the US grew louder today as Fed Funds futures, at the turn of the year maturities, rose above par, while the same time 2-year yields made all-time lows too, and still continues to print new lows below 13bps. The Fed has previously stated its strong aversion to negative rates (Fed Chair Powell noted the current target range as the ‘effective lower bound’), although some draw attention to (non-voter) Bostic’s comments today that all tools remain available for the Fed and that it is in a “whatever it takes” mode. Signalling from the Fed will become even more crucial, where if it does indeed want to stamp out any expectation of a negative FFR, it will need to make that clear to the market; BMO’s strategists to wit, “...if the FOMC drags their feet too much, they run the risk of creating either a self fulfilling dynamic and/or having to effectively implement ‘hawkish’ Fedspeak later down the road.” Note that Fed’s Barkin (non-voter) said later that negative rates have been tried in other place but there is nothing to make him think they are worth a try in the US.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLES USD 0.44 LOWER AT USD 23.55; WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 0.79 LOWER AT USD 24.83; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 0.26 LOWER AT USD 29.46</strong></p><p>Oil had a choppy session after it made strong gains overnight and in the European session to then retreat towards settlement. Futures had found some support from the Chinese trade data, which showed the world’s largest crude buyer’s imports in April rose by 1.7% from their March levels to 9.88mln BPD; Citi highlights that although it was an increase, the Y/Y figure is still down by 7.5%, “As with other data, the market currently seems to prefer a more optimistic interpretation, preferring to view the glass as 25% full rather than 75% empty.” Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco raised its June Arab Light Official Selling Prices to Asia by USD 1.40 to USD -5.90 vs Oman/Dubai average (Prev. USD -7.30); NW Europe at USD -3.70 vs ICE Brent (Prev. USD -10.25); US at USD +0.75 vs ASCI (Prev. -0.75). Equinor’s CEO said he does not believe in a quick rebound in the oil market and that it could take until 2022 to see markets normalise, noting that deeper cuts would improve the situation.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>NFP PREVIEW</strong>: The April jobs report is due for release at 0830 ET/1330 BST on Friday; the consensus looks for -22mln and for the unemployment rate to spike to 16.0%; our full preview can be accessed <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-nonfarm-payrolls-april-to-be-released-at-0830-et-1330-bst-on-8th-may-2020-07-05-2020\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> Weekly initial jobless claims data printed 3.17mln, higher than the 3mln consensus; the prior was revised up slightly to 3.85mln -- the cumulative total since mid-March is now around 33.5mln. Continuing claims, meanwhile, jumped to 22.65mln, above the 19.91mln forecast, while the prior was revised higher -- that 22.65mln is around three times greater than the peak in the great recession. Oxford Economics said that while initial claims continue to slowly recede from their peaks (this was the fifth straight week lower), they remain at painfully high levels - claims at 3.17mln are around 15 times the level of claims before the pandemic, OxEco notes, and the consultancy sees continuing claims numbers continuing to rise given it lags initial claims. Others have noted that weekly claims are decaying at rate of around 15-18% per week, and if the current trajectory continues, claims will be sub-1mln in the second or third week of June.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.2% at 2881, NDX +1.3% at 9102, DJIA +0.9% at 23,876</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy +2.5%, Financials +2.2%, Materials +2.1%, IT +1.5%, Discretionary +1.3%, Industrials +1.1%, Real Estate +0.9%, Communicatons +0.6%, Utilities +0.4%, Health Care -0.1%, Staples -0.4%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) comparable SSS -4.7% in April. Liberty Global (LBTYA) and Telefonica (TEF) announced an agreement to merge its UK business to create a 50:50 JV. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) (Information Technology/Software) has reportedly been made accessible to teachers by the NYC education department after the DoE withdrew its ban on the app. Tesla (TSLA) has halted production at its Chinese factory. It is also worth noting CEO Musk will be appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast again; last time TSLA stock was hit after he smoked marijuana on the show. TSLA is also reportedly planning to restart production at its Fremont, California factory. Moderna (MRNA) is finalising the protocol for its Phase 3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine MRNA-1273 and is expected to begin in early summer in 2020. Elsewhere, NIH Dr. Fauci highlighted the vaccine candidate, as well as Oxford University’s, accompanied by comments he expects the US to have a vaccine as soon as January. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Kohl’s (KSS) are to reopen select stores across the US.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>T-Mobile (TMUS) beat on EPS, missed on revenue, ARPU fared better than expected although net subscriber additions missed expectations. Raytheon Technologies (RTX) beat on both EPS and revenue. Paypal (PYPL) missed on EPS and revenue while it forecasts Q2 Adj. EPS growth of 15-20% and revenue growth of 13%. Hilton (HLT) beat on EPS and revenue; noted systemwide comparable RevPAR -22.6%. Lyft (LYFT) saw an EPS miss, although revenue was better than expected, it also announced it is planning to cut costs by USD 300mln by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>JPM EARNINGS TRACKER: </strong>The bank notes that 66% of S&amp;P500 companies have topped EPS estimates, with overall EPS growth improving since the start of the season (now -9% Y/Y); however, the bank says that earnings beats have not picked up, with the percentage of companies beating EPS estimates still at 10-year lows. In terms of sectors, Materials, Discretionary and Financials are showing double-digit negative EPS growth. Meanwhile, revenue growth is more or less flat.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>EU COMMISSION </strong>said that ESM use will not require a macro adjustment programme. The Commission said that enhanced surveillance linked to the ESM use will only focus on funds being used for COVID-19 health care costs, and that use by countries will not involve ad hoc on-site missions from the Commission. Furthermore, surveillance linked to ESM use would end as soon as the money has been spent. The announcement appears to make it more politically palatable for countries to utilise the ESM, such as Italy, which has raised issues with the potential conditions alongside it, which opponents fear could be too arduous.</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>DXY snaps three-day run of gains, while XAU spikes as markets start pricing US negative rates</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The buck’s rally has hit a wall, and looks likely to snap a three day run of higher closes, amid an improved risk sentiment after China trade data overnight, and reports that senior US/China trade officials have scheduled a call for next week. DXY managed to hold 100.00 in morning trade, however as the session progressed, downside continued as Fed Funds Futures for 2021 began pricing negative rates, dragging DXY sub-100.00. Despite constructive risk sentiment (equities higher, cyclical FX firmer) Treasury yields were lower, likely hampering the dollar, albeit this week still has seen decent appreciation in yields. Once again data had little impact as participants look towards the reopening the economy and medical updates.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> Unlike in previous sessions, the Yen seemingly tracked risk appetite today while USDJPY bounced off support at the 106.00 level. It is worth noting Japanese players have returned from Golden week, although JPM believes activity will not return to normal until next week, therefore, next week could see a bit more volatility. JPMorgan also highlights the 106.00/10 support once again (which held very well overnight) with 105.15/25 beneath the key figure. On the upside, 106.35/40 is interim resistance.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency reclaimed 1.08 to the upside against the greenback while EURJPY also found some reprieve amid a EUR rebound and JPY weakness, and is now back above the 3-year low which was printed yesterday. The single currency also will likely find some solace in the EU commission, which said the use of the ESM will not require a macro adjustment programme and the use by countries will not involve ad hoc on site missions from the Commission, so seemingly making use of the ESM more accessible for those who wish to use the funding, and potentially removing some of the stigma; it does not appear US players have reacted to the news with any conviction, so it is worth paying attention when the Europeans arrive on Friday (UK is away for bank holiday), and worth keeping an eye on BTP yields in Italy.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> The precious metal is seeing solid gains today despite fairly constructive risk sentiment. The yellow metal is back above the USD 1,700/oz mark from USD 1685/oz at the intraday lows. The rally occurred while Fed Funds Futures in 2021 begun to price in negative rates, as real yields came in, which tends to be supportive for gold; and also as Treasury yields fall across the curve, paring back some of yesterday’s upside/steepening (see here), while USD weakness is also a traditional supporting factor. RBC yesterday revised its price target cases for gold, noting elevated gold prices are here to stay for now. RBC’s base case sees gold rising to USD 1,788/oz in 2020, and then USD 1,893/oz in 2021. RBC believes gold can continue to win if equities continue to improve as investors are acutely aware of the risks taken and will look for hedges in gold. It also says that low nominal real rates and eased monetary conditions will likely keep gold elevated, and the rate correlation to gold will reassert itself.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, CAD):</strong> With equities firmer risk sensitive currencies are performing well, particularly AUD, NZD and CAD.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> however is still firmer but lacklustre in comparison. The BoE rate decision saw sterling strength as some bets for an expansion of QE were unwound, however, two policymakers did opt for an expansion at this meeting while Governor Bailey signalled an expansion of QE could come as early as June, likely capping any GBP upside. Bailey also did not slam the door shut on the idea of negative rates, although he intimated it wasn’t likely to be seen in the short term.</p><p><strong>AUD </strong>the G10 outperformer buoyed by risk sentiment while overnight data showed the highest ever monthly surplus in March, blitzing expectations. The trade data is likely to support Q1 GDP data, analysts said. Citi, however, thinks that AUD remains overvalued, and if the currency “starts to dribble off”, its Sydney desk sees AUD eying a break below the recent range low around 0.6370, potentially targeting a move on to 62 handle before the week closes out. AUD also likely caught a tailwind from solid China trade data given the strong ties between the two.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong> gains also benefiting from risk sentiment but more so from the early gains in oil, although oil gains had pared but the CAD strength did not. Ivey PMI saw little reaction to the Looney. Scotia highlights “with broader market volatility contained and crude oil picking up, we think the CAD should be able to pick up a bit more support in the near term at least even if broader range trading around 1.40 persists for now.”</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong>&nbsp; EMFX was mixed, the majority were firmer against a falling greenback although BRL failed to take suit given the deeper than expected 75bps cut from the BCB last night while leaving the door open for further easing, but perhaps not another 75bps cut. Elsewhere, EMFX was firmer with decent appreciation in TRY and MXN, with the latter benefitting from firmer oil prices while its inflation was slightly firmer than expected although headline inflation still printed -1%. The lira saw heavy support after a Turkish FX regulator banned FX trades from three foreign banks after local reports noted the recent weakness was an attack organised by banks while Turkey recently expanded its FX manipulation definition. RUB was also firmer but off highs as the currency tracked oil prices as oil off highs.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The TPLEX was heavily bid on Thursday, reversing all of the losses incurred after Wednesday’s bazooka refunding announcement. The short-end was particularly sought, where Fed Funds futures began pricing US negative rates in December out. By settlement, 2s -5bps at 0.13%, 5s -8bps at 0.30%, 10s 9bps at 0.63%, 30s -10bps at 1.31%. The grind lower in yields got going as the US session got underway, having risen in APAC and early European trade. There was no new/immediate catalyst for the strength, although desks note the likelihood of participants seizing the rate back-up from Wednesday in anticipation that the Fed would not let the UST curve continue to steepen. Tomorrow’s weekly Fed purchases schedule will be key for gauging the Fed’s tolerance for curve steepening, where it has up to now been tapering its weekly purchases, albeit at a declining rate each week; Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe the two most likely scenarios are either a lowering to USD 30bln per week, or to be maintained at USD 40bln per week, which if the former, the bank expects a steepening of the curve amid the supply/demand dynamic becoming “unfavourable”, while the latter would see little reaction. The TPLEX also continued to rally in the face of record corporate issuance – IFR noted this week marked the third largest for supply ever – where over ten IG issuers came to the dollar market today, including CVX, which is still to announce the size and pricing of its announced seven-parter.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong>&nbsp;the speculation around negative interest rates in the US grew louder today as Fed Funds futures, at the turn of the year maturities, rose above par, while the same time 2-year yields made all-time lows too, and still continues to print new lows below 13bps. The Fed has previously stated its strong aversion to negative rates (Fed Chair Powell noted the current target range as the ‘effective lower bound’), although some draw attention to (non-voter) Bostic’s comments today that all tools remain available for the Fed and that it is in a “whatever it takes” mode. Signalling from the Fed will become even more crucial, where if it does indeed want to stamp out any expectation of a negative FFR, it will need to make that clear to the market; BMO’s strategists to wit, “...if the FOMC drags their feet too much, they run the risk of creating either a self fulfilling dynamic and/or having to effectively implement ‘hawkish’ Fedspeak later down the road.” Note that Fed’s Barkin (non-voter) said later that negative rates have been tried in other place but there is nothing to make him think they are worth a try in the US.</p>",

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD: </strong>The buck’s rally has hit a wall, and looks likely to snap a three day run of higher closes, amid an improved risk sentiment after China trade data overnight, and reports that senior US/China trade officials have scheduled a call for next week. DXY managed to hold 100.00 in morning trade, however as the session progressed, downside continued as Fed Funds Futures for 2021 began pricing negative rates, dragging DXY sub-100.00. Despite constructive risk sentiment (equities higher, cyclical FX firmer) Treasury yields were lower, likely hampering the dollar, albeit this week still has seen decent appreciation in yields. Once again data had little impact as participants look towards the reopening the economy and medical updates.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>Unlike in previous sessions, the Yen seemingly tracked risk appetite today while USDJPY bounced off support at the 106.00 level. It is worth noting Japanese players have returned from Golden week, although JPM believes activity will not return to normal until next week, therefore, next week could see a bit more volatility. JPMorgan also highlights the 106.00/10 support once again (which held very well overnight) with 105.15/25 beneath the key figure. On the upside, 106.35/40 is interim resistance.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The single currency reclaimed 1.08 to the upside against the greenback while EURJPY also found some reprieve amid a EUR rebound and JPY weakness, and is now back above the 3-year low which was printed yesterday. The single currency also will likely find some solace in the EU commission, which said the use of the ESM will not require a macro adjustment programme and the use by countries will not involve ad hoc on site missions from the commission, so seemingly making use of the ESM more accessible for those who wish to use the funding, and potentially removing some of the stigma; it does not appear US players have reacted to the news with any conviction, so it is worth paying attention when the Europeans arrive on Friday (UK is away for bank holiday), and worth keeping an eye on BTP yields in Italy.</p><p><strong>XAU: </strong>The precious metal is seeing solid gains today despite fairly constructive risk sentiment. The yellow metal is back above the USD 1,700/oz mark from USD 1685/oz at the intraday lows. The rally occurred while Fed Funds Futures in 2021 begun to price in negative rates, as real yields came in, which tends to be supportive for gold; and also as Treasury yields fall across the curve, paring back some of yesterday’s upside/steepening (see here), while USD weakness is also a traditional supporting factor. RBC yesterday revised its price target cases for gold, noting elevated gold prices are here to stay for now. RBC’s base case sees gold rising to USD 1,788/oz in 2020, and then USD 1,893/oz in 2021. RBC believes gold can continue to win if equities continue to improve as investors are acutely aware of the risks taken and will look for hedges in gold. It also says that low nominal real rates and eased monetary conditions will likely keep gold elevated, and the rate correlation to gold will reassert itself.</p><p><strong>CLYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, CAD): </strong>With equities firmer risk sensitive currencies are performing well, particularly AUD, NZD and CAD.</p><p><strong>GBP </strong>however is still firmer but lackluster in comparison. The BoE rate decision saw sterling strength as some bets for an expansion of QE were unwound, however, two policymakers did opt for an expansion at this meeting while Governor Bailey signaled an expansion of QE could come as early as June, likely capping any GBP upside. Bailey also did not slam the door shut on the idea of negative rates, although he intimated it wasn’t likely to be seen in the short term.</p><p><strong>AUD </strong>the G10 outperformer buoyed by risk sentiment while overnight data showed the highest ever monthly surplus in March, blitzing expectations. The trade data is likely to support Q1 GDP data, anlaysts said. Citi, however, thinks that AUD remains overvalued, and if the currency \"starts to dribble off\", its Sydney desk sees AUD eying a break below the recent range low around 0.6370, potentially targeting a move on to 62 handle before the week closes out. AUD also likely caught a tailwind from solid China trade data given the strong ties between the two.</p><p><strong>CAD </strong>gains also benefiting from risk sentiment but more so from the early gains in oil, although oil gains had pared but the CAD strength did not. Ivey PMI saw little reaction to the Looney. Scotia highlights “with broader market volatility contained and crude oil picking up, we think the CAD should be able to pick up a bit more support in the near term at least even if broader range trading around 1.40 persists for now.”</p><p><strong>EMFX: &nbsp;</strong>EMFX was mixed, the majority were firmer against a falling greenback although BRL failed to take suit given the deeper than expected 75bps cut from the BCB last night while leaving the door open for further easing, but perhaps not another 75bps cut. Elsewhere, EMFX was firmer with decent appreciation in TRY and MXN, with the latter benefitting from firmer oil prices while its inflation was slightly firmer than expected although headline inflation still printed -1%. The lira saw heavy support after a Turkish FX regulator banned FX trades from three foreign banks after local reports noted the recent weakness was an attack organized by banks while Turkey recently expanded its FX manipulation definition. RUB was also firmer but off highs as the currency tracked oil prices as oil off highs.&nbsp;</p>",

The yellow metal is back above the USD 1,700/oz mark from USD 1685/oz at the intraday lows. The rally occurred while Fed Funds Futures in 2021 begun to price in negative rates, as real yields came in, which tends to be supportive for gold; and also as Treasury yields fall across the curve, paring back some of yesterday’s upside/steepening (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/price-action-2-year-yields-fall-to-fresh-record-low-fed-funds-jan-2021-priced-negative-rates-07-05-2020\">see here</a>), while USD weakness is also a traditional supporting factor.</li><li>RBC yesterday revised its price target cases for gold, noting elevated gold prices are here to stay for now. RBC’s base case sees gold rising to USD 1,788/oz in 2020, and then USD 1,893/oz in 2021. RBC believes gold can continue to win if equities continue to improve as investors are acutely aware of the risks taken and will look for hedges in gold. It also says that low nominal real rates and eased monetary conditions will likely keep gold elevated, and the rate correlation to gold will reassert itself.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

Cable knee-jerked from the low 1.2300 area to just over 1.2400, but failed to sustain short covering momentum as the Dollar remained firm independently and garnering impetus from the demise of others, like the Yen that could not breach 106.00 before the re-open of Japanese markets following Golden Week. On that note, Usd/Jpy has now rebounded through 106.50 where 1.1 bn option expiries ran off, with the <strong>DXY </strong>largely<strong> </strong>undaunted by the latest multi-million US initial claims tally on its way to a new post-month end/early May high at 100.4000. Back to Sterling, 1.2300 vs the Greenback has given way to leave April 21’s 1.2248 low exposed and Eur/Gbp is edging towards 0.8800 even though the single currency has slipped a bit deeper below 1.0800 against the Buck amidst more evidence of Eurozone economic fallout from COVID-19 and ECB President Lagarde underlining the GC’s determination to implement its PSPP (and PEPP by the same token) regardless of GCC challenges on the grounds of proportionality.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All benefiting from renewed risk appetite, initially prompted by rises in Chinese and Aussie exports boosting respective trade surpluses, and then supplemented by reports that high level trade talks between the US and China are scheduled to take place by phone next week. The Loonie also got a lift from crude prices resuming their rebound, with Saudi Aramco lifting Arab Light OSPs, to the extent that Usd/Cad is back within striking distance of 1.4000 even though Canadian Ivey PMIs fell again, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both holding the bulk of their gains near 0.6450 and 0.6040 respectively.</p><p><strong>CHF/NOK</strong></p><p>Contrasting sessions for the Swiss Franc and Norwegian Crown, as Usd/Chf climbed beyond 0.9750 and Eur/Chf bottomed at 1.0525 after a marked increase in SNB FX reserves, but Eur/Nok pared post-Norges Bank gains to get even closer to the psychological 11.0000 mark. To recap, the benchmark depo rate was cut to zero from 0.25% against consensus for no change and F-loans were extended from end May to end August, but Governor Olsen implied no more easing even though NIRP is not ruled out in line with the rate path.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>At last some joy if not quite delight for the Try, but only after drastic measures from Turkey’s banking authority banning 3 foreign banks from trading FX, as the Lira recovers from new record lows near 7.2700, but the baton passed to the Brl after the BCB decided to lower the Selic rate by 75 bp vs -1/2 point consensus late yesterday and the Czk also had to contend with the CNB matching the move to 0.25% from 1%. Real nursing some losses from around 5.8760 at worst and Eur/Czk towards the upper end of a 27.081-323 range.</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO SNAPSHOT:</strong> US equity futures are trading with a risk-on bias after Wednesday’s declines, which has been attributed to better than expected trade data out of China, notably exports which rose at a rate of 3.5% against expectations of an 11% decline; however, China's trade with the US continued to decline from January to April, the total value of China-US trade dropped 12.8% whilst China's imports from the US slid 3% and exports plunged 15.9%, and most of the export component is buoyed by medical shipments. Top US/China trade officials have also scheduled a call for next week, the first since January, and ahead of schedule (it is supposed to take place every six months); the news followed remarks from Trump yesterday that he'd be able to report in a week or two whether China's purchases were in line with its Phase 1 commitments. On that note, it was interesting that the PBOC fixed the USDCNY stronger for a second day, which has been taken as a positive by traders (this is definitely one to keep an eye on). There has been quite a bit of central bank activity to note: BOE left rates unchanged, but two policymakers called for more QE; the Norges Bank cut by 25bps rates to zero and sees no more cuts; while BCB delivered a larger than expected 75bps rate cut aftermarket on Wednesday. US Treasury yields are little changed after yesterday’s supply-induced steepening, the DXY is flat; remains above 100, gold and oil are higher.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>All sectors open in positive territory, painting a risk friendly picture, with Energy outperforming amid firmer crude prices while Financials are also doing well after Ameriprise Financial (AMP) reported. The defensive Health Care, Staples, and Real Estate sectors are the laggards today, although still positive.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) comparable SSS -4.7% in April. Liberty Global (LBTYA) and Telefonica (TEF) announced an agreement to merge its UK business to create a 50:50 JV. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) (Information Technology/Software) has reportedly been made accessible to teachers by the NYC education department after the DoE withdrew its ban on the app. Tesla (TSLA) has halted production at its Chinese factory. It is also worth noting CEO Musk will be appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast again; last time TSLA stock was hit after he smoked marijuana on the show. TSLA is also reportedly planning to restart production at its Fremont, California factory. Moderna (MRNA) is finalizing the protocol for its Phase 3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine MRNA-1273 and is expected to begin in early summer in 2020. Elsewhere, NIH Dr. Fauci highlighted the vaccine candidate, as well as Oxford University’s, accompanied by comments he expects the US to have a vaccine as soon as January. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Kohl’s (KSS) are to reopen select stores across the US.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> T-Mobile (TMUS) beat on EPS, missed on revenue, ARPU fared better than expected although net subscriber additions missed expectations. Raytheon Technologies (RTX) beat on both EPS and revenue. Paypal (PYPL) missed on EPS and revenue while it forecasts Q2 Adj. EPS growth of 15-20% and revenue growth of 13%. Hilton (HLT) beat on EPS and revenue; noted systemwide comparable RevPAR -22.6%. Lyft (LYFT) saw an EPS miss, although revenue was better than expected, it also announced it is planning to cut costs by USD 300mln by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>JPM EARNINGS TRACKER: </strong>The bank notes that 66% of S&amp;P500 companies have topped EPS estimates, with overall EPS growth improving since the start of the season (now -9% Y/Y); however, the bank says that earnings beats have not picked up, with the percentage of companies beating EPS estimates still at 10-year lows. In terms of sectors, Materials, Discretionary and Financials are showing double-digit negative EPS growth. Meanwhile, revenue growth is more or less flat.</p><p><strong>HOW FAR CAN S&amp;P 500 RALLY GO: </strong>We have noted several times that the downside in stocks has been backstopped by the Fed, while the upside is subject to risks around the pace and extent of normalisation of global economies, putting a lid on upside. From a valuation perspective, with forward earnings expected around USD 170 in FY 2021, and assuming a p/e of 17 or 18 suggests that the S&amp;P 500 at 2,890-3,060 is consistent with the current narrative. Much has been made about how incoming economic data has been dire, and the S&amp;P 500 may not be reflecting that, given that we are up around 30% from March lows, and US stocks have pared losses more quickly than other bear markets. Capital Economics thinks the gloom is now reflected in analysts’ expectations for earnings, noting that the latest estimates see EPS 40% lower in Q2 2020 than in Q4 2019, and while it is expected to recover as lockdowns are lifted, it is only seen returning to its pre-crisis levels by mid-2021. CapEco notes that sectors like IT, Communication and Health Care, which are likely to do relatively well out of the crisis, are heavily weighted in the index, while sectors like Energy and Financials, which have been hit really hard by the crisis, have a much smaller weight. “With all this in mind, the strength of the S&amp;P 500 is not as irrational as it first appears,” CapEco writes, “and assuming that the virus outbreak is slowly brought under control in the coming months, and economies gradually begin to re-open in that time, we would not be surprised to see the index advance a bit further.” The consultancy notes that two key risks remain: “success in containing the virus could be reversed as economies reopen, and the consensus for maintaining current levels of policy support might break down. But assuming neither materialises, the rally in equities may have a bit further to run.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO SNAPSHOT:</strong> US equity futures are trading with a risk-on bias after Wednesday’s declines, which has been attributed to better than expected trade data out of China, notably exports which rose at a rate of 3.5% against expectations of an 11% decline; however, China's trade with the US continued to decline from January to April, the total value of China-US trade dropped 12.8% whilst China's imports from the US slid 3% and exports plunged 15.9%, and most of the export component is buoyed by medical shipments. Top US/China trade officials have also scheduled a call for next week, the first since January, and ahead of schedule (it is supposed to take place every six months); the news followed remarks from Trump yesterday that he'd be able to report in a week or two whether China's purchases were in line with its Phase 1 commitments. On that note, it was interesting that the PBOC fixed the USDCNY stronger for a second day, which has been taken as a positive by traders (this is definitely one to keep an eye on). There has been quite a bit of central bank activity to note: BOE left rates unchanged, but two policymakers called for more QE; the Norges Bank cut by 25bps rates to zero and sees no more cuts; while BCB delivered a larger than expected 75bps rate cut aftermarket on Wednesday. US Treasury yields are little changed after yesterday’s supply-induced steepening, the DXY is flat, gold and oil are higher.</p><p><strong>JPM EARNINGS TRACKER:</strong> The bank notes that 66% of S&amp;P500 companies have topped EPS estimates, with overall EPS growth improving since the start of the season (now -9% Y/Y); however, the bank says that earnings beats have not picked up, with the percentage of companies beating EPS estimates still at 10-year lows. In terms of sectors, Materials, Discretionary and Financials are showing double-digit negative EPS growth. Meanwhile, revenue growth is more or less flat.</p><p><strong>HOW FAR CAN S&amp;P 500 RALLY GO:</strong> We have noted several times that the downside in stocks has been backstopped by the Fed, while the upside is subject to risks around the pace and extent of normalisation of global economies, putting a lid on upside. From a valuation perspective, with forward earnings expected around USD 170 in FY 2021, and assuming a p/e of 17 or 18 suggests that the S&amp;P 500 at 2,890-3,060 is consistent with the current narrative. Much has been made about how incoming economic data has been dire, and the S&amp;P 500 may not be reflecting that, given that we are up around 30% from March lows, and US stocks have pared losses more quickly than other bear markets. Capital Economics thinks the gloom is now reflected in analysts’ expectations for earnings, noting that the latest estimates see EPS 40% lower in Q2 2020 than in Q4 2019, and while it is expected to recover as lockdowns are lifted, it is only seen returning to its pre-crisis levels by mid-2021. CapEco notes that sectors like IT, Communication and Health Care, which are likely to do relatively well out of the crisis, are heavily weighted in the index, while sectors like Energy and Financials, which have been hit really hard by the crisis, have a much smaller weight. “With all this in mind, the strength of the S&amp;P 500 is not as irrational as it first appears,” CapEco writes, “and assuming that the virus outbreak is slowly brought under control in the coming months, and economies gradually begin to re-open in that time, we would not be surprised to see the index advance a bit further.” The consultancy notes that two key risks remain: “success in containing the virus could be reversed as economies reopen, and the consensus for maintaining current levels of policy support might break down. But assuming neither materialises, the rally in equities may have a bit further to run.”</p><p><strong>JOBLESS CLAIMS COMING UP:</strong> Weekly initial jobless claims are seen lower for the fifth straight week at 3.0mln (range: 1.5mln to 9mln) in the week through 2/May, down from last week’s 3.8mln. Pantheon Macroeconomics is forecasting 3.2mln, basing its projection on hard data from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona, and Google trends data on searches for \"file for unemployment\". \"This approach to the data has been reasonably successful, but the history is very short and we can't be sure it will remain reliable,\" but with that said, it says that is forecast is consistent with the recent decay in claims (around 16%/week); \"if that continues, claims will slip below one million per week by the third week of June. That would still be horrendous, bearing in mind that claims rose by only 665K in the worst single week after the crash of 2008, but it would be a world away from the nightmare of March and April.\" Full primer <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-initial-jobless-claims-due-at-0830-et-1330-bst-seen-lower-for-a-fifth-straight-week-07-05-2020\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GET OUT OF CASH: </strong>UBS is telling its clients to get out of cash, and that waiting for absolute clarity before deploying cash will leave investors on the sidelines for a prolonged period. \"Instead, those that have sat out the rally can build up long-term positions by combining an averaging-in strategy with put writing,\" the bank says, explaining that averaging into riskier assets enables investors to deploy capital while smoothing near-term bumps. \"In addition, we think a selective approach in equities may help side-step some risks, with particular opportunity in select cyclicals, stable, and defensive stocks.\" UBS has also previously suggested moving into themes accelerated by COVID-19. \"Many of the changes the coronavirus imposes on our everyday lives will hopefully be relatively short-lived. But the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to accelerate some longer-term trends, from e-commerce and fintech to automation, robotics, and genetic therapies.\"</p>",

That being said, it is difficult to pre-judge what the sentiment will be during the call, notably due to recent rhetoric emanating from the two nations, whilst US-China trade data does not bode well regarding the Phase One deal. Nonetheless, broad-based gains are seen across Europe, albeit the SMI (+0.3%) lags the region as its heavyweight healthcare names remain in modest negative territory, potentially on a risk-move as the sector lags. Energy and Materials meanwhile show slight outperformance as the oil and base metal complexes regain ground. The sector breakdown reflects a similar performance. In terms of individual movers – Telefonica (+0.2%) gave up most of its opening gains after rising some 3% on the back of a finalised deal with Liberty Global to merge UK assets worth just over GBP 31bln, set to reshape the UK telecom market. As such, Vodafone (-0.9%) and BT (-9.6%) see losses with the latter also exacerbated by dividend cancellation alongside its earnings.

Aud/Usd is consolidating around 0.6450 and comfortably above a hefty option expiry at 0.6415 (1.2 bn), while Nzd/Usd has regained a firm foothold over 0.6000. Elsewhere, the Loonie has pared losses vs its US counterpart following a sharp slide to a fresh wtd trough circa 1.4173 on Wednesday by a full point in similar vein to crude prices after their midweek setback, eyeing Canadian Ivey PMIs on the eve of the big NA jobs showdown.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF -</strong> The return of Japanese participants from their Golden Week holidays has dampened demand for the Yen along with the aforementioned US-China trade talk news, with Usd/Jpy bouncing from 106.00 to 106.50 or so and the base of decent 1 bn+ expiry interest at the half round number, but not reaching those sitting between 106.65-75 in the same amount. In contrast, expiries may help the Euro deeper depreciation below 1.0800 after yet more worrying Eurozone economic releases, as 1.4 bn resides from 1.0780-75, though recoveries could also be thwarted by 2.3 bn at the 1.0800 strike or 1 bn just above (1.0805-10), especially if the DXY continues to make headway on the 100.000 handle having eclipsed its pre-month peak at 100.270.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Most regional currencies are benefiting from a broad upturn in risk sentiment and oil returning to its recovery path, but for the Lira very little respite as Usd/Try rallies through the apex of Turkey’s 2018 crisis and remains in a seemingly endless uptrend approaching 7.2600.

However, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> appear to have calmed down and found a base after yesterday’s pronounced bear-steepening on supply issues as attention shifts to more anecdotal jobs data (Challenger and initial claims) ahead of NFP on Friday.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures initially traded within a tight range relative to recent performance, with the benchmarks fluctuating between gains and losses in early trade. The contracts found a floor early-doors amid reports of a phone call next week between the top US and Chinese negotiators. Looking at the oil market itself, the forward Brent curve has tightened in recent days, reflecting an ease in the oil market glut – aided by production cuts and reviving demand as economies re-open from lockdown. On that front, Saudi Aramco raised its Arab Light OSPs to Asia following two consecutive cuts – signaling resurfacing demand in the region. That being said, Equinor’s CEO does not believe in a quick rebound in the oil market and added it could take until 2022 to see oil markets back normalise. The CEO said deeper cuts would improve the situation. WTI June now resides north of USD 25/bbl, and extends its intraday range (low USD 23.41/bbl), whilst Brent July sees itself printing fresh session highs, having rebounded from a low of USD 29.22/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> saw some impetus from a softer Buck but remains below the USD 1700/oz mark (daily range USD 1685-1693.40/oz). <strong>Copper prices</strong> meanwhile remain underpinned by the rebound in the Chinese Trade Balance, coupled with upside seen in stocks supported by the US-China headlines.</p><p><strong>Saudi Aramco raises June Arab Light Official Selling Prices to Asia by USD 1.40 to USD -5.90 vs. Oman/Dubai average (Prev.

The contracts found a floor early-doors amid reports of a phone call next week between the top US and Chinese negotiators. Looking at the oil market itself, the forward <strong>Brent</strong> curve has tightened in recent days, reflecting an ease in the oil market glut – aided by production cuts and reviving demand as economies re-open from lockdown. On that front, Saudi Aramco raised its Arab Light OSPs to Asia following two consecutive cuts – signaling resurfacing demand in the region. That being said, Equinor’s CEO does not believe in a quick rebound in the oil market and added it could take until 2022 to see oil markets back normalise. The CEO said deeper cuts would improve the situation. <strong>WTI</strong> June now resides north of USD 25/bbl, and extends its intraday range (low USD 23.41/bbl), whilst <strong>Brent</strong> July sees itself printing fresh session highs, having rebounded from a low of USD 29.22/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> saw some impetus from a softer Buck but remains below the USD 1700/oz mark (daily range USD 1685-1693.40/oz). <strong>Copper</strong> prices meanwhile remain underpinned by the rebound in the Chinese Trade Balance, coupled with upside seen in stocks supported by the US-China headlines.</p>",

That would still be horrendous, bearing in mind that claims rose by only 665K in the worst single week after the crash of 2008, but it would be a world away from the nightmare of March and April.\"</li><li>NOTE, this week’s initial jobless claims will not feature in the official BLS employment situation report, due tomorrow (the BLS survey period was two weeks ago).</li><li>Yesterday’s ADP private payrolls gauge showed 20.236mln jobs were shed from the US economy in April, close to the consensus view looking for -20mln; analysts had noted the uncertainty heading into the release, which had left expectations wide. It is difficult to read too much into the data, given much of the gloom had been signalled by other metrics in advance (primarily, the more timely weekly initial jobless claims data), and as such, the data merely confirms what the market was already discounting (hence the muted reaction in asset prices).</li><li>In terms of the breakdown, Capital Economics noted that ADP job losses came predominantly in the services sector, though the health care sector was hit as well. CapEco says that the report is a bit light on details of any potential methodological problems this month: “The ADP counts anyone on the active payroll rather than just people who were paid during the month, which is the official non-farm payroll definition,” and with many folks temporarily laid off, “that could have created a discrepancy, with those people still on the active payroll, but not counted in the official non-farm payroll figures and also qualifying as unemployed in the other official household survey.” The takeaway, Capital Economics says, is that the official BLS print on Friday might look even worse than the ADP report implies. Currently, the consensus looks for -21.9mln (though this may be revised ahead of the release), and the jobless rate is seen jumping to 16.0% from 4.4%. The narrative on Friday may be focusing around the ‘largest monthly fall ever’ line.</li></ul>",

The trade deal calls for the two negotiators to convene every six months – this call will be takin place ahead of schedule.</p><p><strong>SENTIMENT</strong>: It is difficult to pre-judge what the sentiment will be during the call, notably due to recent rhetoric emanating from the two nations – initially sparked by the US’ complaints regarding China’s reporting and handling on the coronavirus. However, participants note that some discussions are better than none.</p><p><strong>RECENT RHETORIC:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>US</strong>: US President Trump recently threatened to terminate the deal with China should it not adhere to its commitments under the Phase One deal. Furthermore, the US President floated the idea of tariffs as a potential punishment for China’s handling of the pandemic. Trump has blamed China for playing down the scale and risks of the virus – a move believed to be correlated to the US Presidential Election.</li><li><strong>CHINA</strong>: China has blamed US officials for attempting to shift their “poor handling” of the pandemic. Analysts via SCMP noted that China can retaliate by dumping its US Treasury holdings whilst imposing tariffs of their own, albeit Chinese officials yesterday noted that tariffs should not be used as a weapon. Meanwhile, underlying soured sentiment remains on the Hong Kong front – Chinese Foreign Ministry said it opposes US interference on China's affairs with Hong Kong.</li></ul><p><strong>TRADE DATA:</strong> The Chinese trade data released overnight for April printed a substantially larger than the expected surplus in CNY and USD terms as the nation resurfaces from lockdown. However, China's trade with the US continued to decline from January to April, the total value of China-US trade dropped 12.8% whilst China's imports from the US slid 3% and exports plunged 15.9%, according to Global Times.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX saw pronounced bear steepening after the US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement came in above many expectations, particularly in the longer-dated tenors, in addition to further chunky corporate issuance volumes. Analysts also suggested that the lack of 4-year or 6-year announcement in the headlines seems to suggest the play of curve steepening will likely continue as the Treasury extends the average maturity of its outstanding debt. TD’s analysts noted, “USTs will need more setup into the auctions next week, which should steepen the curve and underperform OIS and swaps (i.e., tighter swap spreads).” The raised issuance naturally draws attention onto the Fed, and whether it will be able to continue tapering purchases as it has been if the market lets yields rise further. TD believes the Fed will ultimately rise to the challenge given that growth is unlikely to rebound, “But the Fed’s “pain point” may be higher rates with better Treasury market functioning and easier financial conditions.” By settlement today, 2s and 5s little changed at 0.18% and 0.38%, respectively, with 10s +5bps at 0.71%, and 30s +8bps at 1.41%.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade subdued following the uninspiring handover from US where risk appetite was sapped by weak ADP jobs data, US-China tensions and a decline in the energy complex in which oil prices snapped a 5-day win streak. Furthermore, the region is mulling over key releases from China including Caixin PMIs and the latest trade data. ASX 200 (-0.3%) is lower with the declines led by losses in energy names and gold miners due to the pressure in oil and after the precious metal gave up the USD 1700/oz status, while financials are also weaker with the largest bank CBA downbeat as reports speculate the Co. could have been impacted the worst from the coronavirus among the big 4 banks ahead of next week’s quarterly update. Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) initially underperformed on return from the 5-day Golden Week closure to take its first opportunity to digest the nationwide state of emergency extension in Japan, with index heavyweight Fast Retailing pressured pre-earnings and Softbank is depressed after being sued by WeWork, although the losses in the index were retraced amid favourable currency moves. Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are both cautious due to the increased US-China tensions and after Caixin Services and Composite PMI figures remained in contraction territory, although losses were stemmed by the Chinese trade data which showed a higher surplus and surprise expansion in exports although imports remained at a significant contraction.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer and remains above the 100.00 level amid the risk averse tone and following the weakness in its major counterparts, in particular, EUR/USD which fell below the 1.0800 handle as the German court ruling on ECB purchases continued to reverberate in the single currency. Sources have noted that the ECB is said to be keen to avoid a direct role in the German constitutional court legal case and are also reportedly divided on who will respond to the German courts request, with recent bleak Eurozone economic forecasts also providing the currency with no favours. GBP/USD is lacklustre and extended on yesterday’s losses despite PM Johnson hinting they could begin easing lockdown restrictions from Monday, while focus turns to the BoE’s policy announcement which is scheduled for the earlier time of 0700BST. Elsewhere, USD/JPY attempts to nurse losses after rebounding from support at 106.00, while antipodeans were choppy but found some mild support after Australia trade figures showed a wider than expected surplus and a 15% M/M jump in exports and following the mostly better than expected China trade data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower despite the cautious risk tone as prices track the recent downside in T-notes which had been pressured after a larger than expected US Treasury quarterly refunding announcement, although the losses in JGBs are stemmed amid the BoJ’s presence in the market for nearly JPY 800bln of JGBs.</p>",
