Novak also stated that Q1 output reductions will total 1.7mln bpd and that OPEC+ are to meet again in March. (Newswires)</p><p>OPEC+ ministerial panel was said to have recommended output cuts until June according to two sources and sources also noted OPEC+ recommendation for deeper oil cuts is conditional on full compliance by all members. Furthermore, other reports stated OPEC have reportedly agreed on a 500k bpd output-quota reduction according to a delegate and Energy Intel's Amena Bakr later tweeted that the oil ministers still didn’t start discussing the 500k proposed cut citing a delegate.

OPEC news flow was heavy, with reports gyrating on whether the cartel would be deepening output cuts, and by how much. Ultimately, at time of writing, the committee is reportedly warming to a 500k additional cut to output, although the meeting is yet to conclude, with supposed issue on Iraq remaining; also, the 500k cut was slightly overshadowed by reports that non-OPEC members, such as Russia, could exclude condensate from their output, a seemingly arbitrary measure to bring down output on paper.

OPEC news flow was heavy, with reports gyrating on whether the cartel would be deepening output cuts, and by how much. Ultimately, at time of writing, the committee is reportedly warming to a 500k additional cut to output, although the meeting is yet to conclude, with supposed issue on Iraq remaining; also, the 500k cut was slightly overshadowed by reports that non-OPEC members, such as Russia, could exclude condensate from their output, a seemingly arbitrary measure to bring down output on paper. Brent outperformed its Texan other half, settling over half a buck stronger, whilst WTI settled flat. The T-Note sold-off again, albeit less pronounced, whilst finding some support after the US cash equity open as bourses sold off, although equities found some support towards the close. In FX space, the USD continued its move lower against the majority of its crosses, barring JPY, with the greenback little phased by the narrowing trade deficit and inline factory orders. Friday is not short of risk events, where the focal part remains November’s NFP report where the street looks for an above trend 180k jobs added; meanwhile, participants await an official press conference and decision from OPEC+.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED UNCHANGED AT USD 58.43/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLED USD 0.39 HIGHER AT USD 63.39/BBL. </strong>The crude complex saw choppy trade today as participants reacted to a slew of OPEC headlines, but ultimately mixed after coming off highs. This morning’s price action started off rising after source reports that OPEC+ are to discuss deeper oil cuts of greater than 400k BPD as the main scenario, where Iran reportedly announced it would agree to any majority decision amongst OPEC members. Shortly after midday ET, an OPEC delegate told energy intel that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are proposing a 500k BPD additional output cut, on condition on total compliance, although the kingdom later denied such reports on the exact figure, although no comment was made on the ‘condition on total compliance’ comment. Russia’s Energy Minister Novak later announced that the decision was taken to fully comply with the oil output reduction deal of 500k BPD from Q1 2020 to April first with a review scheduled in March. Some of the gains in oil were pared, amid the announcement that the OPEC+ committedly recommended excluding numbers on gas condensate on Non-OPEC members, where all OPEC+ members reportedly agreed with the recommendation, where 760k BPD of Russia’s production will be excluded. Further sources towards the end of the session spoke of a 350k BPD cut from OPEC and a 150k BPD cut from Non-OPEC members including Russia. Also, Angola reportedly left the meeting stating they want to quit the OPEC cartel. The meeting heavily over run, reportedly over issues which includes Iraq, and not because of Iran, with an official noting that the press conference for Thursday would be cancelled until Friday.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> This morning China's MOFCOM announced the US and China maintain close communication whilst reiterating that if a Phase One deal is reached, tariffs should be reduced, although had no more details on the talks. However, during the session US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said talks are on track and that the two sides held a deputy level phone call on Wednesday night. Mnuchin’s comments were then followed by US President Trump who also stated the two sides are in meeting, which are going well. Trump added that something could happen on the December 15th tariffs, but that is currently not in discussion. In the tail-end of the session, WSJ also reported that talks were going well, citing comments from Beijing, however it did state that the two are at differences between the amount of agricultural goods to be purchased by China, although the article did not cite an official on that point. Meanwhile, Mnuchin said the market is in charge of the dollar, not the government or the Fed; Mnuchin has previously stressed the FX rate as a key component of a trade deal with China.</p><p><strong>* US INTERNATIONAL TRADE:</strong>&nbsp;The US trade deficit narrowed to USD 47.2bln from USD 51.1bln in October, which was revised from USD 52.5bln, narrower than the expected deficit of USD 48.7bln. The decrease in the trade deficit was driven by a 1.7% fall in imports, which managed to outstrip a 0.2% decline in exports. The decline in imports was driven by a fall in consumer goods imports; CapEco remind us that consumer goods imports had surged in August ahead of the imposition of further tariffs on imported Chinese goods, so the decline could represent the continued adjustment back to the normality. However, there was also a fall in auto &amp; parts imports, which CapEco suggest represents the disruption to GM’s cross-border supply chain from the UAW strike. “Both effects will be temporary, meaning imports are likely to bounce back in November and December”, concludes the consultancy. The US’ trade deficit with China narrowed to USD 31.26bln, slightly less than the prior deficit of USD 31.62bln.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN TRADE BALANCE:&nbsp;</strong>The Canadian economy experienced a narrower than expected trade deficit in the month of October, at CAD 1.08bln vs. the expected CAD -1.37bln. September’s original CAD 0.98bln deficit was revised lower to a deficit CAD 1.23bln. RBC note that the GM strike in the US, which also prompted temporary layoffs in Canada, was likely to have played a role in the decline; in the US, the strike resulted in a drop auto &amp; parts imports, weighing on imports more than exports and likely had a similar effect in Canada. “Despite a slightly better than expected outcome in October, we continue to think trade will act as a drag on growth again in Q4” RBC continue, observing that “a challenging global backdrop has made 2019 a year to forget for exporters”. However, non-energy export volumes still managed to post a decent increase, although they are only displaying a faint pulse, observes the bank, still down 0.3% from a year earlier.</p><p><strong>* BOC:</strong> Deputy Governor Lane said global economic uncertainty is likely to persist even if US and China reach a trade deal, with the uncertainty likely to have a lasting effect. He added that the damaging trade impact is only partly offset by easy monetary policy, however, the improved tone of developments in recent weeks gives BOC more confidence in October outlook for growth and inflation. The comments came across slightly more cautious than the tone struck in the statement of the BoC’s rate decision yesterday, although there was little by way of market impact at the time; as a reminder, the BOC yesterday said there was \"nascent evidence\" that the global economy is stabilising. The BoC statement added that future decisions will be guided by the adverse impact of trade conflicts vs. sources of resilience in the Canadian economy.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Britain, France and Germany accused Iran of working on nuclear capable missiles, AFP reported. Earlier, the country had had said that it was determined to continue with its ballistic missile programme in a letter to the UN.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE (Z0) FUTURES SETTLED 3 TICKS LOWER AT 129-10:</strong> The T-Note continued to sell-off on Thursday, albeit less pronounced than Wednesday, with the prior session’s trade optimism reducing demand for the haven. Prices found some support close to the US cash equity open, where major equity bourses were offered in lack of immediate news flow, with some desks noting profit taking, bringing the TPLEX off lows into settlement, where the curve steepened slightly, mainly in the front to belly; the 2-year yield was little changed, 5-year yield up by 1.8bps and the 10- and 30-year yields both up by 1.5bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 +0.15% at 3118, Nasdaq-100 +0.14% at 8308, Dow Jones +0.10% at 27678.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> : Biogen (BIIB) released results of its Alzheimers drug Aducanumab, (the drug which saw the stock rally 40% in one day back in October), which found in its EMERGE study, a high dose reduced clinical decline; however in its ENGAGE study, it did not reduce clinical decline. The initial result saw the stock fall ~5%, however some analysts announced the results could be seen as a positive in comparison to the previous results. United Airlines (UAL) traded slightly lower after its CEO Munoz announced he is to step down, with President Scott Kirby to be the successor. Amazon (AMZN) had its cloud computing operations join FTC scrutiny who were initially only targeting its retail business.&nbsp; Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) lost over 50% in value after its experimental depression study failed to meet its primary endpoint.

Tractor Supply (TSCO) announced a CEO succession plan with Hal Lawton, formerly President of Macy’s (M), to become CEO from January 13th, 2020.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Dollar General (DG) performed well after EPS &amp; Revenue beats whilst also increasing its guidance.&nbsp; Brown-Forman (BF.B) traded lower despite EPS &amp; revenue beats as it provided poor FY guidance, and Synopsys (SNPS) also lower after issuing soft guidance. Tiffany (TIF) were subdued slightly after it missed top and bottom line estimates ahead of it being acquired by LVMH (MC FP).</p><p><strong>* BROKER MOVES:</strong> Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Stifel with a USD 1,525 PT from USD 1,325, highlighting revenue trends have subsequently re-accelerated, and noting the recent CEO move was a positive for investors. Elsewhere, employees are reportedly frustrated that Larry Page and Sergey Brin have stepped down, according to Business Insider. Facebook, Inc. (FB) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Stifel, with a PT of USD 240 from USD 215; analyst John Egbert is incrementally positive on its ability to sustain above-market advertisement revenue growth and maintain a healthy level of user engagement and growth following its latest earnings report. F5 Networks (FFIV) traded lower amid a downgraded to Underperform from Buy and BofAML. Nike (NKE) had an upgrade to Conviction Buy from Neutral at Goldman Sachs, with a PT of USD 112, as analyst Alexandra Walvis believes the co. is on the cusp of a sharp acceleration in earnings growth; GS also expects earnings to grow 19% annually over the next three years, adding China is the key driver to aid the co. driving revenues at a high teens pace.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD continued its fall on the week, falling beneath 97.50 to lows of 97.35, the 6th consecutive drop amid some of this week’s less-than-rosy data. Participants are eyeing tomorrows NFP report tomorrow where estimates are for an above trend rise of 180k to the headline figure. GBP continued its rally to breach 1.3150 from lows just above 1.31 to peak at 1.3165, just shy of a fib retracement level at 1.3168. Participants continue to eye polls to determine the Tory lead on Labour, with the latest ComRes poll maintaining the differential at 10 points, slightly higher than some of the polls over the weekend where BMG had the differential as low as 6 points. CAD also traded firmer today continuing its rally from the hawkish BOC yesterday, which was followed with comments from BoC’s Lane who noted there was no discussion of an insurance cut although he did mention global economic uncertainty is likely to persist even if US and China pursue a trade deal. Yesterday, The BoC yesterday stated there is nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilising and will be guided by the adverse impact of trade conflicts vs. sources of resilience in the Canadian economy. Inline trade data and a strong IveyPMI failed to move the Looney given the upbeat tone from the BoC Yesterday, and as participants were eyeing updates from the JMMC meeting today for price action on crude. Havens were marginally firmer today paring some of the prior day gains amid a lack of China trade updates, although President Trump did reiterate talks are going well and Mnuchin stated deputy phone calls are ongoing.

This morning’s price action started off rising after source reports that OPEC+ are to discuss deeper oil cuts of greater than 400k BPD as the main scenario, where Iran reportedly announced it would agree to any majority decision amongst OPEC members. Shortly after midday ET, an OPEC delegate told energy intel that Saudi Arabia and Venezuala are proposing a 500k BPD additional output cut, on condition on total compliance, although the kingdom later denied such reports on the exact figure, although no comment was made on the ‘condition on total compliance’ comment. Russia’s Energy Minister Novak later announced that the decision was taken to fully comply with the oil output reduction deal of 500k BPD from Q1 2020 to April first with a review scheduled in March. Some of the gains in oil were pared, amid the announcement that the OPEC+ committedly recommended excluding numbers on gas condensate on Non-Opec members, where all OPEC+ members reportedly agreed with the recommendation, where 760k BPD of Russia’s production will be excluded.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CAD, GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>All poised to end the European session in the green with the Loonie supported by lingering effects from yesterday’s BoC alongside comments from Deputy Governor Lane who noted developments in recent weeks have given the Central Bank more confidence in its October outlook for growth and inflation. Additionally, recent favourable price action in the energy complex could also be providing tailwinds to the Canadian currency, although could be subject to volatility as the OPEC meeting gets underway. USD/CAD looks on course to end the European session towards the bottom of its 1.3158-3203 intraday range, with Canadian labour market data on tomorrow’s docket. Meanwhile, Sterling remains the outperformer heading into the EU close and supported by the Tory party maintaining its lead over the opposition Labour Party in the latest poll (Savana/ComRes) as election day looms. Cable looks to end the session retaining a 1.31+ status having traded within a daily range of 1.3102-1.3148 ahead of potential resistance at 1.3168 (Fib) and 1.3185. Elsewhere, EUR/USD eked mild gains, more so on the back of a softer Buck, and largely side-lined a slump (and significant miss) in German industrial orders – with the pair eclipsing 1.1100 to the upside at one point before retreating below the figure having clocked in an daily parameter of 1.1077-1.1101.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Both heading into session-end on the backfoots, but more-so the Aussie - on the back of further sub-par data, this time in the form of retail sales and trade balance, with the former printing flat MM and the latter a smaller surplus than had hoped. US-China news-flow has been light today and thus provided little impetus to price action. AUD/USD is poised to end the EU day at the bottom of the today’s 0.6823-6855 ahead of its 100 and 50 DMAs both around 0.6810-13. Meanwhile, earlier gains in the NZD/USD has gradually waned but the pair remains somewhat cushioned by the RBNZ’s attempt to bulletproof its financial system via a capital requirement hike. The pair has lost more ground below its 200 DMA (0.6541) and hovers around session lows heading into the end of the EU day, having printed a 0.6520-6562 intraday parameter.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Another session of losses for the broad Dollar and index with DXY heading into the European close at fresh daily lows in a continuation of the downside seen by the string of recent downbeat US data. All eyes turn to tomorrow’s US Labour market report, with the Street looking for an above trend 180k payrolls to be added to the US economy in November (full preview available on the NEWsquawk Research Suite). DXY resides nearer to the bottom of today’s 97.41-60 range with potential support at its 50 WMA at 97.16.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Little changed on the day, but USD/JPY dipped back below its 200 DMA (108.87) in early US trade, but remains in a relatively tight intraday band of 108.77-99 with little by way of new substance on the trade front, and on standby for tomorrow’s US payroll numbers.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/23402/download\">here</a>. The Street looks for an above trend 180k in November. The unemployment rate is seen unchanged, though some gauges suggest the jobless rate could be subject to upside risk. The pace of wage growth is seen rising a touch in the month. Other indicators have been mixed; the ADP gauge of payrolls missed expectations, but did not contain the positive impact from GM workers returning from strikes; jobless claims data surged to a five-month high in the survey week, though has subsequently fallen towards the low end of its recent range, providing a mixed signal. The ISM manufacturing survey's employment sub index was weak, though the services gauge, which is more representative of the US economy, ticked up slightly. Meanwhile, announced job cuts are down on a monthly and yearly basis, though the YTD measure in November was the highest since 2015. The report will be released on 6th December 2019 at 1330 GMT/0830 EDT. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/23402/download\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>&nbsp;<i>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the Research Suite section of the portal.

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.6%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%)</strong> were also lifted on the trade hopes and following the announcement of measures to support the Hong Kong economy, but with gains capped given the lack of actual meaningful breakthrough on the trade front and amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction.

The FTSE 100 (-0.1%) is again the laggard, amid a firmer Pound. Elsewhere, the CAC 40 (+0.4%) is holding up well despite France being hit by nationwide strikes, as workers across a range of professions protest French President Macron’s proposed pension reforms. Subsequently, a walk out by air traffic controllers has however resulted in some airlines being hit; Air France (-1.0%) said it was axing 30% of internal flights and 15% of short-haul international routes and easyJet (-0.8%) reportedly cancelled 223 domestic and short-haul international flights and warned that others risk being delayed, although yesterday’s approximate 4% rally in crude oil prices is also likely weighing on airlines in general – other names including IAG (-1.1%) and Deutsche Lufthansa (-1.2%) are also lower. Elsewhere, luxury names including Hermes (+1.6%) and Swatch Group (+1.6%) are on the front foot after Kering (+1.6%) reportedly held explanatory talks with Moncler (+9.2%) regarding a potential combination, which would mark continued consolidation within the sector following LVMH’s (+0.9%) buyout of Tiffany &amp; Co. last month. Sectors are mostly in the green, barring Tech (unch.), Materials (unch.) and Telecoms (-0.1%), the latter weighed by continued underperformance in Orange (-0.7%), with the Co. still suffering following yesterday’s disappointing dividend outlook. In terms of other individual movers; Novartis (+0.7%) shares are underpinned by the news that around 90 innovative new molecular entities are emerging from the Co.’s institutes for BioMed research. Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (-0.9%) shares are under pressure after reports that the Co. is in talks with Italian tax authorities regarding an audit, which added that the Co. may be liable for up to USD 1.5bln in “exit tax”. Metro Bank (+0.6%) shares are supported following the resignation of its CEO Donaldson, who will be replaced by Frumkin on an interim basis.

Aside from that, little pertinent news flow thus far to influence price action. GBP/USD extends gains above 1.3100 before hitting a wall just under the 1.3150 mark, ahead of resistance in the form of a Fib level at 1.3168 followed by 1.3185. Meanwhile, the EUR derives support from a marginally softer USD and largely side-lined a slump (and significant miss) in German industrial orders, albeit the country’s construction PMI indicated a decent rebound. EUR/USD continues to eke modest gains to session highs just under the 1.1100 mark (1.1078-93 intraday range thus far), with hefty options eyeing today’s NY cut – EUR 1.0bln between 1.1090-1.1100 and EUR 2.4bln around 1.1110-25.</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD, CAD - </strong>Mixed trade down under with the Kiwi buoyed by the RBNZ’s attempt to bulletproof its financial system via a capital requirement hike in order to withstand economic volatility. The Central Bank also gave lenders an extra two years to raise the required capital and flexibility on how they raise it. NZD/USD remains underpinned but has subsided a bulk of its overnight gains with the pair still in the green but back below its 200 DMA (~0.6540), having hit resistance around 0.6562-65. Meanwhile, the Aussie remains lacklustre on the back of further sub-par data, this time in the form of retail sales and trade balance, with the former printing flat and the latter a smaller surplus than had hoped. AUD/USD remains in the red and closer to the bottom of the current intraday band (0.6855-31) with the pair’s 100 and 50 DMAs (0.6814 and 0.6811 respectively) in the way of the psychological 0.6800. Elsewhere, the CAD remains modestly firmer in the aftermath of yesterday’s BoC hawkish hold and upbeat view on the economy, although traders will be eyeing BoC’s Lane on the docket later today (1245GMT) who is likely to speak on the economy. USD/CAD remains sub-1.3200 having touched a base around 1.3180.</p><p><strong>DXY, JPY - </strong>The broad Dollar and Index remain under pressure given the recent string of downbeat data and ahead of the monthly US jobs report tomorrow. DXY manages to stay afloat above 97.50 (just about) having clocked in a current range of 97.49-60 with little in terms of scheduled data/speakers to influence price action. Finally, USD/JPY is relatively flat and just a whisker away from the 109.00 mark, albeit above its 200 DMA at 108.87, with USD 1.4bln in options set to expire around 109.00-15.</p><p><strong>Indian Repo Rate 5.15% vs. Exp. 4.9% (Prev. 5.15%);</strong> Decision was unanimous.

European bonds are currently subdued by around 20/30 ticks, with the <strong>Bund</strong> having moved below yesterday’s low of 172.44 to a session low of 172.18. From a technical perspective, below the 172.0 handle support resides at 171.97 and then we have Tuesday’s low of 171.61 if the move was to extend. Data wise, this mornings Industrial orders out of Germany missed, but didn’t dictate too much price action and contributed to the assessment that the Germany economy is not beginning a turnaround. Additionally, the EZ GDP metrics were unrevised though retail sales were slightly softer than expected. Elsewhere, <strong>Gilts </strong>are similarly subdued in-line with European counterparts; note, the most recent election polling out of Savanta/ComRes maintaining the Conservative-Labour lead at 10pp; looking ahead for the UK tomorrow sees the next UK election debate featuring Johnson and Corbyn. Stateside, <strong>USTs</strong> are little changed at present and as such holding up better than their European peers ahead of a number of US data prints and potential comments from Fed’s Quarles; and with tomorrow’s jobs report moving into focus.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES – OPEC Meeting scheduled to begin at 14:00GMT/09:00ET&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Crude markets eke mild gains as the complex consolidates following yesterday’s strong price action and with participants cautious as they await the outcome of today’s JMMC and OPEC meetings</strong>; the former has already begun, while the latter is scheduled to begin at 14:00 GMT. Tomorrow OPEC+ will meet and the final decision on the cartels production cuts will be made. Sources this morning suggested that OPEC+ are to discuss deeper oil output cuts of more than 400k BPD as the main scenario, news which triggered some fleeting upside in crude markets and something which has been alluded to by the Iraqi oil minister on multiple occasions in recent days. This contrasts somewhat with the reported consensus amongst OPEC minister yesterday that a deeper cut will \"be harder to pull off this time\". Russian Oil Minister Novak has so far declined to reveal the country’s stance for the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, but the country is expected to resist any push for further cuts; \"Russia's reluctance to deepen the cuts at the risk of compromising its market share and undermining the predictability of its oil rent is now well-known,\" said Aperio Intelligence, adding \"Russia's strategy will be to seek to preserve the status quo without either overplaying its hand or overreaching\". Moreover, the country is also pushing to have its condensate output to become exempt from its quota, a request which may prove contentious, especially with Iranian Energy Minister stating that condensates of gas in the OPEC quota system is not a OPEC discussion. In terms of other crude specific news flow; the latest Platts Oil Survey revealed that OPEC pumped 29.65mln BPD of crude in November, with 11 quota members achieving cut compliance of 145%. The survey found that Iraq and Nigeria are still supplying in excess of the cap but are moving closer to compliance. Poor compliance by these members is a point of frustrations for the Saudis; just yesterday, it was reported that the Saudis are threatening to increase production back to its quota level, rather than reducing production by more than is required, due to growing frustration with those not complying with the existing OPEC cut agreement. Thus far, the Saudi’s have shouldered the bulk of the cuts, with recent analysis suggesting that without the Saudi’s overcompliance, OPEC+ compliance would be just 70%. On a different note, Goldman and Barclays provided some updates oil market forecasts; Goldman expects a Brent-WTI differential of USD 4.50/bbl in 2020, from the YTD levels of close to USD 7.0/bbl, while Barclays forecasts Brent to average USD 62/bbl and WTI to average USD 57/bbl for Q4 2019 and 2020. Moving over to metals; gold is slightly lower, amid a lack of demand for havens, but is relatively rangebound about the USD 1480/oz level. Meanwhile, positive risk tone has underpinned copper, which has this morning managed to eclipse yesterday’s USD 2.6655/lbs high, albeit only slightly.</p><p><strong>OPEC+ are to discuss deeper oil output cuts of more than 400k BPD as the main scenario, according to sources.

Finally, USD/JPY is relatively flat and just a whisker away from the 109.00 mark, albeit above its 200 DMA at 108.87, with USD 1.4bln in options set to expire around 109.00-15.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>European debt is downbeat today as market sentiment remains positive for now as the risk landscape gradually improved overnight, today’s notable risk factors are largely crude based as the OPEC meeting begins; while, as always, US-China updates may well dominate with this morning’s news flow has been neutral/positive. European bonds are currently subdued by around 20/30 ticks, with the Bund having moved below yesterday’s low of 172.44 to a session low of 172.18. From a technical perspective, below the 172.0 handle support resides at 171.97 and then we have Tuesday’s low of 171.61 if the move was to extend. Data wise, this morning’s Industrial orders out of Germany missed, but didn’t dictate too much price action and contributed to the assessment that the Germany economy is not beginning a turnaround. Additionally, the EZ GDP metrics were unrevised though retail sales were slightly softer than expected. Elsewhere, Gilts are similarly subdued in-line with European counterparts; note, the most recent election polling out of Savanta/ComRes maintaining the Conservative-Labour lead at 10pp; looking ahead for the UK tomorrow sees the next UK election debate featuring Johnson and Corbyn. Stateside, USTs are little changed at present and as such holding up better than their European peers ahead of a number of US data prints and potential comments from Fed’s Quarles; and with tomorrow’s jobs report moving into focus.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude markets eke mild gains as the complex consolidates following yesterday’s strong price action and with participants cautious as they await the outcome of today’s JMMC and OPEC meetings; the former has already begun, while the latter is scheduled to begin at 14:00 GMT. Tomorrow OPEC+ will meet and the final decision on the cartels production cuts will be made. Sources this morning suggested that OPEC+ are to discuss deeper oil output cuts of more than 400k BPD as the main scenario, news which triggered some fleeting upside in crude markets and something which has been alluded to by the Iraqi oil minister on multiple occasions in recent days. This contrasts somewhat with the reported consensus amongst OPEC minister yesterday that a deeper cut will \"be harder to pull off this time\". Russian Oil Minister Novak has so far declined to reveal the country’s stance for the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, but the country is expected to resist any push for further cuts; \"Russia's reluctance to deepen the cuts at the risk of compromising its market share and undermining the predictability of its oil rent is now well-known,\" said Aperio Intelligence, adding \"Russia's strategy will be to seek to preserve the status quo without either overplaying its hand or overreaching\". Moreover, the country is also pushing to have its condensate output to become exempt from its quota, a request which may prove contentious, especially with Iranian Energy Minister stating that condensates of gas in the OPEC quota system is not a OPEC discussion. In terms of other crude specific news flow; the latest Platts Oil Survey revealed that OPEC pumped 29.65mln BPD of crude in November, with 11 quota members achieving cut compliance of 145%. The survey found that Iraq and Nigeria are still supplying in excess of the cap but are moving closer to compliance. Poor compliance by these members is a point of frustrations for the Saudis; just yesterday, it was reported that the Saudis are threatening to increase production back to its quota level, rather than reducing production by more than is required, due to growing frustration with those not complying with the existing OPEC cut agreement. Thus far, the Saudi’s have shouldered the bulk of the cuts, with recent analysis suggesting that without the Saudi’s overcompliance, OPEC+ compliance would be just 70%. On a different note, Goldman and Barclays provided some updates oil market forecasts; Goldman expects a <strong>Brent</strong>-<strong>WTI</strong> differential of USD 4.50/bbl in 2020, from the YTD levels of close to USD 7.0/bbl, while Barclays forecasts Brent to average USD 62/bbl and <strong>WTI</strong> to average USD 57/bbl for Q4 2019 and 2020. Moving over to metals; g<strong>old</strong> is slightly lower, amid a lack of demand for havens, but is relatively rangebound about the USD 1480/oz level. Meanwhile, positive risk tone has underpinned <strong>copper</strong>, which has this morning managed to eclipse yesterday’s USD 2.6655/lbs high, albeit only slightly.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was kept afloat by the risk appetite with comments from BoJ board member and dissenter Harada not providing much to sway the currency, while antipodeans saw mixed price action with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> pressured by disappointing Trade and Retail Sales data, whereas <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> gained from the increased bank capital requirement rules by the RBNZ which Westpac suggested will not spur a rate cut.</p><p><strong>Indian Repo Rate 5.15% vs. Exp. 4.9% (Prev. 5.15%);</strong> Decision was unanimous.

Conversely, there were reports that suggested consensus within OPEC that a deeper cut will be harder to pull off this time and that Saudi is threatening to increase production to its quota level amid growing frustration by other producers’ insufficient compliance with the deal, although this did little to halt the rally in WTI which surged to above the USD 58.00/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices edged marginal gains as support from the subdued greenback was mostly offset by a lack of safe-haven demand, while copper conformed to the uneventful tone across the complex and failed to benefit from the improved risk appetite.</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>US is considering sending 14k more troops to the Middle East to counter threats from Iran, according to WSJ.

The sell-off saw some additional pressure after the release of the non-manufacturing ISMs, where participants weren’t dissuaded by the headline miss (sub-components fared better), with the T-Note continuing to move lower after the release. The curve bear-steepened, but not to the same magnitude as yesterday’s bull-flattening; 2s10s rose by 2bps to approximately 20bps, as the 2-year yield rose by 5.2bps whilst the 7-/10-/30-year yields rose collectively by 7.2bps. T-note (z9) futures settled 18 ticks lower at 129-13.</p><p>The mood is reportedly not upbeat after USMCA talks between Mexico’s Seade and USTR Lighthizer, while Seade commented there is no deal yet and they need to resolve “very difficult issues”, according to Politico's Rodriguez.

        "content": "<p>RBI will conclude its 3-day policy meeting on Thursday in which the central bank is expected to lower the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate by 25bps each to 4.90% and 4.65% respectively, according to a majority of analysts across numerous surveys. Furthermore, an Economic Times poll showed all financial institutions surveyed unanimously forecast at least a 25bps cut with nearly a quarter of the respondents open to the potential of a deeper cut.</p><p>The one-sided expectations for the RBI to cut rates again is not much of a surprise given the central bank's aggressive policy action under the stewardship of RBI Governor Das and would complete a year of back-to-back cuts after having reduced rates at every meeting so far in 2019 with a total of 135bps in rate cuts delivered. In addition, when the RBI cut at the last meeting due to economic weakness, it maintained an accommodative stance which essentially leaves the door open to further reductions, while Governor Das also pledged to continue easing if needed and MPC member Dua noted during that meeting that there was policy space to further lower rates to boost domestic growth within the flexible inflation targeting mandate.</p><p>Since then, the data from India has continued to deteriorate with GDP growth for Q2 at its weakest in more than 6 years of 4.5% vs. Exp. 4.7% (Prev. 5.0%), while the latest Industrial Production was at -4.3% vs. Exp. -2.0% (Prev. -1.1%, Rev. -1.4%) and Manufacturing Production also showed a wider contraction of -3.9% (Prev. -1.2%). These soft releases therefore support the case for additional policy action and although Inflation has edged to above the RBI’s 4% target at a 16-month high of 4.62% vs. Exp. 4.25% (Prev. 3.99%), this is seen as unlikely to trigger a pause from the central bank and is not as drastic as the double digit inflation the nation was battling several years ago.</p><p>The announcement is scheduled at 0615GMT/0015CST/1415HKT where aside from the actual rate decision, focus will be on whether the central bank maintains its accommodative stance and if there are any clues in the statement whether the RBI will continue its aggressive policy action into 2020. As a reminder, reactions to RBI policy announcements can be irregular as there have been past occasions when easing surprisingly supported INR due to anticipation of fund inflows from more favourable policies, although with that being said, it is also worth noting that the USD/INR is roughly around the same level now as it was before the RBI embarked on its relentless easing cycle earlier this year.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls</p><ul><li>Deutsche Bank forecasts RBI to cut rates by 25bps at this meeting but doesn't rule out a deeper cut of 35bps.</li><li>HSBC also expects a 25bps cut followed by a similar cut early next year, as it anticipates growth to remain below 5% during the current quarter.</li><li>Nomura sees RBI to cut by 25bps then pause in the first 3 months of 2020, before easing again in April.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are positive across the board as they take impetus from global peers after the trade mood flip-flopped once again to a more positive tone after reports suggested US and China are moving closer to a trade deal despite the heated rhetoric, while US President Trump also reiterated that discussions with China are going very well. ASX 200 (+0.9%) is led by outperformance in tech and energy sectors amid the trade optimism and recent 4% surge in crude prices, with banks also welcoming the RBNZ’s increased capital requirements as some now expect a lower impact than they had previously anticipated. Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) is underpinned by recent currency moves and with Japan set for a multi-trillion stimulus package, as well as talks with South Korea this month to address the trade spat. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are positive on the trade hopes and following the announcement of measures to support the Hong Kong economy, but with gains capped given the lack of any solid breakthrough on the trade front and amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is subdued and looks to retest the 97.50 level to the downside after recent weak data including softer than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and miss on ADP National Employment which comes ahead of Friday’s NFPs, with the greenback also suffering by the gains in its major counterparts including CAD following a hawkish hold at the BoC rate decision where it maintained rates at 1.75% as expected and provided an optimistic tone on the global and domestic economy. In addition, EUR/USD is steady after its recent attempt to surmount the 1.1100 level and with GBP/USD resting on the prior day’s outperformance in which it steamrolled through stops and took out longer-term moving weekly average levels (100 WMA and 200WMA) on its climb to above 1.3100. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is kept afloat by the risk appetite with comments from BoJ board member and dovish dissenter Harada not providing much to sway the currency, while antipodeans saw mixed price action with AUD/USD pressured by disappointing Trade and Retail Sales data, whereas NZD/USD gained from the increased bank capital requirement rules by the RBNZ which Westpac suggested will not spur a rate cut.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGB are lower on spill-over selling from USTs, with demand sapped by the gains across equities and participants sidelined ahead of a 30yr JGB auction.</p>",
