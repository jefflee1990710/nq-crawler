In pharma, Eli Lilly (LLY) dipped after lowering its EPS guidance, Regeneron (RGN) and Vertex (VRTX) both beat estimates but drifted lower through the day. Video game developers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) both nosedived following a miss on top and bottom line estimates as well as lowering guidance; consequentially, competitor Activision Blizzard (ATVI) fell too.

The complex remained bid for most of the European session, moving in tandem with Bunds, but caught a leg lower following a soft 10yr auction. Losses however were quickly pared back and pushing treasuries in flat territory. Yields were mixed across the curve and moves were less than 1bpsm spreads towards a steepening bias. The US sold USD 27bln of 10-year notes on Wednesday at 2.689%, the lowest yield since January 2018. However, demand was fairly weak, the auction tailed by 0.8bps and the bid/cover came in at 2.35x, both worse than average. The composition of buyers pointed to weaker demand too, where primary dealers took the biggest allocation since October 2018. US T-note futures (H9) settled half a tick higher at 121-28+.</p>\r\n",

However, Mnuchin pointed out that US President Trump currently has no plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Republican Senator Grassley, after a briefing with USTR Lighthizer, said the China deal will be done by &ldquo;executive agreement&rdquo; but what happens to the tariffs on March 1 is &ldquo;not definitive&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BoC&#39;s Lane said the bank is closely monitoring the relatively recent use of the CAD as a foreign reserve currency by other nations and that a lower CAD will support the Canadian economy through this period. He explained the lower CAD from a combination of the temporary slowdown in the Canadian economy and the US&rsquo; rising rates. He added that the bank is ready to intervene in the markets if need be, although it hasn&#39;t done in the past twenty years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> EU Council President Tusk said that the EU 27 will make no new Brexit offers, saying that he believes a common solution was still possible and hopes to hear a realistic suggestion from UK PM May to end the impasse. Also, EU Commission President Juncker said the Irish backstop is necessary and the EU can&rsquo;t abandon the idea. In the UK, there were reports that the Malthouse Compromise (which would extend the transition period from the end of 2020 till December 2021 to allow more preparation time for WTO rules) would be prepared by Wednesday evening for PM May to take to the EU tomorrow; however, later reports suggested there was division amongst the Brexiteer group ERG over Malthouse, where a growing number of MPs are becoming increasingly concerned over the time period of the backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BRAZIL CENTRAL BANK:</strong> The bank held rates unchanged at 6.50% in a unanimous decision. It reiterated the need for simulative monetary policy and highlighted that the next move will depend on data, risk outlook and CPI forecasts. It warned that global outlook remains challenging while inflationary pressures, especially from overseas, have cooled down since last meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.35 HIGHER AT USD 54.01/BBL, BRENT (J) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.71 HIGHER AT USD 62.69/BBL</strong>. Oil prices held in the green on Wednesday, supported by the latest EIA data reporting a smaller than expected build in crude stocks (+1.263mln vs. Exp. -2.179mln), while indicating a strong demand for distillates (-2.257mln vs. Exp. -1.814mln). The unplanned outage in Libya, where all ports are reportedly to shut due to poor weather, has also contributed to a lift in prices. UBS argues that near-term pressure indicates weaker supply than what is currently priced in and stated that &ldquo;oil has found a good level of fundamental support&rdquo;, with potential for a move higher in the first half of the year. In news flow, the situation in Venezuela remains in focus with US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reiterating that all options remain on the table. There were also reports that Venezuela&rsquo;s opposition leader Guaido has been in contact with PDVSA partners who have expressed willingness to continue operating in the region. Elsewhere, Azerbaijan is seeing the need to extend OPEC+ oil cuts agreement. Meanwhile, Commerzbank sees Brent prices rising to USD 70/bbl by year-end, and sees Brent averaging USD 65/bbl and WTI averaging USD 60/bbl this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.22% at 2732, NASDAQ -0.37% at 6998, DJI -0.08% at 25390. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -0.73%, Materials -0.68%, Industrials -0.02%, Cons Discretionary -0.51%, Cons Staples +0.07%, Healthcare +0.37%, Financials -0.27%, Tech +0.24%, Telecoms -1.49%, Utilities -0.11%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>General Motors (GM), Walt Disney (DIS) and Fox (FOXA) all opened higher after beating EPS and revenue estimates, GM raided its guidance too. In pharma, Eli Lilly (LLY) dipped after lowering its EPS guidance, Regeneron (RGN) and Vertex (VRTX) both beat estimates but drifted lower through the day. Video game developers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) both nosedived following a miss on top and bottom line estimates as well as lowering guidance; consequentially, competitor Activision Blizzard (ATVI) fell too. Insurance provider Chubb (CB) opened lower after missing its EPS estimate. Arconic (ARNC) underperformed on the back of it appointing its Chairman to its CEO position. Tesla (TSLA) traded lower on the open following it cutting prices on its flagship Model 3 car. Broker moves saw DowDuPont (DWDP) and PayPal (PYPL) underperform after downgrades at Cowen and Guggenheim respectively; Vodafone (VOD) outperformed following an upgrade at BAML. Illumina (ILMN) traded in the green on the back of it appointing former General Electric (GE) executive Sysan Siegel to its board. 3M (MMM) moved higher on appointing its CEO to Chairman position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED HALF A TICK HIGHER AT 121-28+.</strong> Treasuries ended the session mixed and close to the unchanged mark on Wednesday. The complex remained bid for most of the European session, moving in tandem with Bunds, but caught a leg lower following a soft 10yr auction. Losses however were quickly pared back and pushing treasuries in flat territory. Yields were mixed across the curve and moves were less than 1bpsm spreads towards a steepening bias. The US sold USD 27bln of 10-year notes on Wednesday at 2.689%, the lowest yield since January 2018. However, demand was fairly weak, the auction tailed by 0.8bps and the bid/cover came in at 2.35x, both worse than average. The composition of buyers pointed to weaker demand too, where primary dealers took the biggest allocation since October 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 30-YEAR BOND AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 84bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday), and with no coupon or redemptions, net supply is implied at USD 84bln. The Fed will reinvest USD 9.2bln at the 3-year, USD 6.5bln at the 10-year, and USD 4.6bln at the 30-year auction. Barclays analysts note the lacking demand in January&rsquo;s auction where the b/c came in lower than average at 2.2x, as well as the auction tailing by 1.1bps; although domestic investors boosted their allocation to 67%, the highest monthly takedown on record, whilst weaker foreign participation was evident in the indirect&rsquo;s share, which fell to 4% in January from December&rsquo;s 14%. Analysts at SocGen note &ldquo;the 30y sector does not seem to have a clear set-up for the upcoming bond auction and will likely need a concession to be underwritten smoothly.&rdquo; On a positive note they go on to highlight that, &ldquo;the 30y WI yield is trading above the last two auction stops, which should help with the auction takedown.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index marched further north of 96.000 end extended gains, in US afternoon trade, breaking through its 50 DMA at 96.370 towards 96.500. The broad Dollar and index were little budged by comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who downplayed reports of a Trump-Xi meeting later this month. Furthermore, a narrow-than-forecast trade deficit failed to provide the Greenback with any sustainable impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The Aussie remained the marked G10 underperformer after RBA Governor Lowe shifted forward guidance to a more neutral bias vs. the prior tightening stance, with a potential rate cut on the slate if the domestic economy continues to weaken. As such, AUD/USD fell through its 50, 100 DMAs (0.7175,0.7172 respectively) and traded below 0.7150 throughout most of the EU session ahead of reported bids at 0.7100 and then 0.7075. Currently sitting just above 0.7100.The Kiwi fell in sympathy with its antipodean counterpart, but to a lesser extent, with NZD/USD losing more ground below 0.6900 to an intraday low of 0.6829. Meanwhile, the antipodean cross hovered just above 1.0400 (vs. 1.0500 high) for most of the day, having tested the big figure multiple times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:</strong> The next G10 laggard, albeit off lows amid choppy oil action and a rising Buck, with downside exacerbated by BOC Deputy Governor Lane who highlighted that the temporary slowdown in Canada and rising US rates are pressuring the CAD, while stating the CB is ready to intervene if needs be. The release of Canadian housing start did provide the Loonie with some brief support. USD/CAD rose further above 1.3100 to test its 100 DMA just above 1.3200 and ending the US session just off highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP:</strong> Mixed vs. the buck with the EUR pressured in early European trade in light of disappointing German data in the form of factory orders and construction PMI, EUR/USD remained below 1.1400 and tested 1.1370 to the downside, below its 50 DMA at 1.1393, falling victim of US strength. Meanwhile, the Pound was largely dictated by the Greenback amidst the ongoing Brexit uncertainty as PM May spent her second day in Belfast speaking to Irish parties. Cable based around 1.2930 (ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.2900 the figure) before recovering to levels in close proximity to its 21 DMA around 1.2975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The Japanese currency remained the outperformer amidst the overall risk sentiment in the market after the JPY failed to sustain gains about 110.00 in early trade. JPY ended the US session closer towards the middle of a 109.57-110.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW:</strong> Bank of England Monetary Policy Decision, Minutes and QIR Thursday 7th February at 12:00GMT (07:00ET), Press Conference with Governor Carney at 12:30GMT (07:30ET). MPC expected to vote 9-0 in favour of standing pat on rates at 0.75%. Brexit continues to tie the hands of policymakers.

        "content": "<p>The US Treasury will auction USD 84bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday), and with no coupon or redemptions, net supply is implied at USD 84bln. The Fed will reinvest USD 9.2bln at the 3-year, USD 6.5bln at the 10-year, and USD 4.6bln at the 30-year auction. Analysts at Barclays note that recent 10-year auctions have seen decent demand; at the last auction, b/c rose to 2.51x, while dealer participation eased to 22%, the lowest in a year. Last month&#39;s auction also stopped through the screens by 0.8bps (versus a tail of 0.3bps for the six prior auctions). &quot;The 10-year sector seems to have set-up from a relative-value perspective,&quot; Societe Generale&#39;s analysts write, &quot;however, it is rich on an outright basis and will likely warrant concession going into the auction, as the WI yield is below all 10y auction stops since January 2018.&quot; SocGen also says that the sector has cheapened on the 2s10s curve since 31 January. &quot;The current 10y is trading cheap on the Treasury spline versus old 10s, which will likely benefit the auction. The last 10y auction stopped through, with an uptick in the bid/cover ratio, which is a positive for the upcoming auction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent auction history:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>High Yield: (Prev. 2.73, six auction avg 3.02%)<br />Tail: (Prev. -0.8bps, six auction avg 0.1bps)<br />Bid/cover: (Prev. 2.51x, six auction avg 2.49x)<br />Dealers: (Prev. 22%, six auction avg 25.5%)<br />Directs: (Prev. 21%, six auction avg 10.3%)<br />Indirects: (Prev. 57%, six auction avg 63.8%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aussie remained the marked G10 underperformer after RBA Governor Lowe shifted forward guidance to a more neutral bias vs. the prior tightening stance, with a potential rate cut on the slate if the domestic economy continues to weaken. As such, AUD/USD fell through its 50, 100 DMAs (0.7175,0.7172 respectively) and traded below 0.7150 throughout most of the EU session ahead of reported bids at 0.7100 and then 0.7075. The Kiwi fell in sympathy with its antipodean counterpart, but to a lesser extent, with NZD/USD losing more ground below 0.6900 to an intraday low of 0.6845. Meanwhile, the antipodean cross hovered just above 1.0400 (vs. 1.0500 high) for most of the day, having tested the big figure multiple times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next G10 laggard, albeit off lows amid choppy oil action and a rising Buck, with downside exacerbated by BOC Deputy Governor Lane who highlighted that the temporary slowdown in Canada and rising US rates are pressuring the CAD, while stating the CB is ready to intervene if needs be. The release of Canadian housing start did provide the Loonie with some brief support. USD/CAD rose further above 1.3100 to test its 100 DMA just above 1.3200 before easing off highs as the oil complex trimmed losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poised to end the EU session with a 5th&nbsp;day of gains as the index marched further north of 96.000. The broad Dollar and index were little budged by comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who downplayed reports of a Trump-Xi meeting later this month. Furthermore, a narrow-than-forecast trade deficit failed to provide the Greenback with any sustainable impetus.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led higher by tech as it mirrored the sector&rsquo;s outperformance stateside, although the index was initially pressured and briefly retreated below the 6000 level amid weakness in financials due to profit taking and after its top component CBA posted a decline in H1 net. Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) also benefitted from the tailwinds and with focus centred on earnings releases, which has seen the list of best and worst performing stocks in Japan dominated by recent corporate updates.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are in the red [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%], with the exception of the AEX (+0.4%) following earnings from ING Groep (+5.3%). Sectors are broadly in the red, with the exception of IT names who are outperforming slightly following on from their strong performance in the US and overnight. Other notable movers include, CYBG (+15.2%) who are at the top of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. guides their net interest margin to the upper end of their prior range. Also firmly in the green after a 13% increase in their Q4 non-IFRS revenue are Dassault Systemes (+8.6%). This mornings significant earnings came from BNP Paribas (-2.0%) and Daimler (-3.2%) who are both in the red after lowering guidance and missing on Q4 EBIT respectively. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Ocado (-7.9%) as yesterday&rsquo;s fulfilment enter incident will lead to a sales growth reduction until capacity can be increased elsewhere. Separately, GlaxoSmithKline (-1.5%) are expected to report their earnings today at 12:00 GMT. In recent news flow the proposed merger between Alstom (+2.1%) and Siemens (-0.5%) has been rejected by the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; Having rallied in relief after the RBA policy meeting yesterday, the Aussie has recoiled sharply following comments from Governor Lowe signalling a shift in rate guidance via the omission of tightening as the next move and a cut now on the agenda if the jobs market and economy overall weakens. Aud/Usd is now at risk of filling bids ahead of 0.7100 and then 0.7075, while Aud/Nzd is hovering just above 1.0400 vs 1.0500+ in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday&rsquo;s RBA decision and statement, even though the Kiwi has been dragged down with its Antipodean peer &ndash; Nzd/Usd now hovering around 0.6850 from circa 0.6900 overnight. Note, the delayed GDT auction could help the Nzd pare some losses if prices rise again per indications via futures, but a decline after 4 increases in a row cannot be ruled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; Another G10 underperformer and victim of a broad downturn in risk sentiment that has spread to oil, with the Loonie retreating further from sub-1.3100 highs vs its US counterpart and now testing support near 1.3200. Ahead, Canadian building permits may provide some independent impetus along with comments from BoC&rsquo;s Lane not long after the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Bucking the overall trend of losses against the Greenback, as the DXY consolidates above 96.000, after another failure to sustain gains above 110.00, has seen the headline pair pull-back towards 109.50 again, and with hefty option expiries between 109.50-65 (2.2 bn) also a potential draw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/EUR - All narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, but with the Pound paring losses on the back some technical buying as Cable based around 1.2925 for a 2nd time and leverage accounts reportedly took profit on short positions instigated from 1.3050 to 1.3000 yesterday. Recovery high 1.2973, just shy of the 21 DMA at 1.2975. Meanwhile, the Franc remains anchored around parity and the single currency probed a bit further below 1.1400 to test bids at 1.1380 before regaining some composure ahead of 1.1375 Fib support. However, Eur/Usd still looks fundamentally bearish amidst yet more disappointing German data/surveys (factory orders and construction PMI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again no standout or clear driver, but Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from best levels, with the former forging a slender new Eurex high at 165.68 (+19 ticks) before revisiting intraday lows, while the latter declined to a fresh Liffe intraday low of 123.47 (-5 ticks vs +23 ticks at best). Tech impulses are almost certain to have played a part as the 10 year German benchmark continues to meet offers/resistance around the 0.15% cash to futures conversion level, and its UK counterpart had a chart gap to plug having kicked off higher. Supply issues may also be hampering bulls given Italy&rsquo;s 30 year syndication that is drawing strong investor interest, and with 10 year US T-notes looming that may require some concession as Treasury futures retain a mild bid and flattening bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively downbeat session in the energy complex thus far, with WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-0.6%) pressured by the overall risk-averse sentiment, alongside a firmer dollar and latest release of the API crude stocks. US crude stocks increase by 2.514mln barrels last week, a wider build than the expected 2.200mln barrels while distillate fuel oil inventories printed a surprise build. News flow has been light for the complex, though prices failed to gain any lasting support from reports that all Libyan oil exporting ports are shut due to adverse weather conditions. Looking ahead, participant will be eyeing the DoE crude inventory at 15:30GMT today alongside US production numbers which remained at a record for three consecutive weeks. Elsewhere, metals are mixed with spot gold (-0.2%) largely dictated by Dollar moves rather than the risk-sentiment. Meanwhile, iron ore May&rsquo;19 futures rose in excess of 3% after Brazilian mining giant Vale declared a force majeure on some contracts, including one affecting 30mln tonnes of iron ore production a year, amid health and safety concerns. Finally, copper prices found some support amid hopes of easing trade tensions after US President Trump said he is to meet with Chinese President Xi later this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Vale declared force majeure in iron ore sale contracts. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Libyan oil exporting ports are reportedly to shut due to poor weather.

Sectors are broadly in the red, with the exception of IT names who are outperforming slightly following on from their strong performance in the US and overnight. Other notable movers include, CYBG (+15.2%) who are at the top of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. guides their net interest margin to the upper end of their prior range. Also firmly in the green after a 13% increase in their Q4 non-IFRS revenue are Dassault Systemes (+8.6%). This mornings significant earnings came from BNP Paribas (-2.0%) and Daimler (-3.2%) who are both in the red after lowering guidance and missing on Q4 EBIT respectively. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Ocado (-7.9%) as yesterday&rsquo;s fulfilment enter incident will lead to a sales growth reduction until capacity can be increased elsewhere. Separately, GlaxoSmithKline (-1.5%) are expected to report their earnings today at 12:00 GMT. In recent news flow the proposed rail merger between Alstom (+2.1%) and Siemens (-0.5%) has been rejected by the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; Having rallied in relief after the RBA policy meeting yesterday, the Aussie has recoiled sharply following comments from Governor Lowe signalling a shift in rate guidance via the omission of tightening as the next move and a cut now on the agenda if the jobs market and economy overall weakens. Aud/Usd is now at risk of filling bids ahead of 0.7100 and then 0.7075, while Aud/Nzd is hovering just above 1.0400 vs 1.0500+ in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday&rsquo;s RBA decision and statement, even though the Kiwi has been dragged down with its Antipodean peer &ndash; Nzd/Usd now hovering around 0.6850 from circa 0.6900 overnight. Note, the delayed GDT auction could help the Nzd pare some losses if prices rise again per indications via futures, but a decline after 4 increases in a row cannot be ruled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; Another G10 underperformer and victim of a broad downturn in risk sentiment that has spread to oil, with the Loonie retreating further from sub-1.3100 highs vs its US counterpart and now testing support near 1.3200. Ahead, Canadian building permits may provide some independent impetus along with comments from BoC&rsquo;s Lane not long after the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Bucking the overall trend of losses against the Greenback, as the DXY consolidates above 96.000, after another failure to sustain gains above 110.00, has seen the headline pair pull-back towards 109.50 again, and with hefty option expiries between 109.50-65 (2.2 bn) also a potential draw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/EUR - All narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, but with the Pound paring losses on the back some technical buying as Cable based around 1.2925 for a 2nd time and leverage accounts reportedly took profit on short positions instigated from 1.3050 to 1.3000 yesterday. Recovery high 1.2973, just shy of the 21 DMA at 1.2975. Meanwhile, the Franc remains anchored around parity and the single currency probed a bit further below 1.1400 to test bids at 1.1380 before regaining some composure ahead of 1.1375 Fib support. However, Eur/Usd still looks fundamentally bearish amidst yet more disappointing German data/surveys (factory orders and construction PMI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again no standout or clear driver, but Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from best levels, with the former forging a slender new Eurex high at 165.68 (+19 ticks) before revisiting intraday lows, while the latter declined to a fresh Liffe intraday low of 123.47 (-5 ticks vs +23 ticks at best). Tech impulses are almost certain to have played a part as the 10 year German benchmark continues to meet offers/resistance around the 0.15% cash to futures conversion level, and its UK counterpart had a chart gap to plug having kicked off higher. Supply issues may also be hampering bulls given Italy&rsquo;s 30 year syndication that is drawing strong investor interest, and with 10 year US T-notes looming that may require some concession as Treasury futures retain a mild bid and flattening bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively downbeat session in the energy complex thus far, with WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-0.6%) pressured by the overall risk-averse sentiment, alongside a firmer dollar and latest release of the API crude stocks. US crude stocks increase by 2.514mln barrels last week, a wider build than the expected 2.200mln barrels while distillate fuel oil inventories printed a surprise build. News flow has been light for the complex, though prices failed to gain any lasting support from reports that all Libyan oil exporting ports are shut due to adverse weather conditions. Looking ahead, participant will be eyeing the DoE crude inventory at 15:30GMT today alongside US production numbers which remained at a record for three consecutive weeks. Elsewhere, metals are mixed with spot gold (-0.2%) largely dictated by Dollar moves rather than the risk-sentiment. Meanwhile, iron ore May&rsquo;19 futures rose in excess of 3% after Brazilian mining giant Vale declared a force majeure on some contracts, including one affecting 30mln tonnes of iron ore production a year, amid health and safety concerns. Finally, copper prices found some support amid hopes of easing trade tensions after US President Trump said he is to meet with Chinese President Xi later this month.</p>\r\n",

Tech impulses are almost certain to have played a part as the 10 year German benchmark continues to meet offers/resistance around the 0.15% cash to futures conversion level, and its UK counterpart had a chart gap to plug having kicked off higher.

Moreover, the NIESR has downgraded its 2018 growth forecast even in the event that a Brexit deal is secured by March 29, while the CBI warns that 40 trade agreements spanning 5 continents could be in jeopardy if Britain leaves without an agreement. Looking at early Liffe price moves in more detail, Gilts started at 123.72 vs their previous 123.52 settlement and advanced a bit further to 123.75 before running out of steam around chart resistance, while the 3 month strip is hovering just below highs of +0.5 to +2 ticks on the day.</p>\r\n",

In related news, US Trade Representative Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will visit Beijing early next week for trade discussions, while reports also noted that China is said to have agreed to negotiate on items which were previously off-limits according to a senior administration official.

There were separate reports that the Department for exiting the EU are looking at a plan that would use technology to keep the Irish border open; to be tested in March. (Telegraph/Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to have suggested to business leaders during a meeting yesterday that she was seeking a legally binding limit to the backstop rather than negotiating a new one, which is not what Brexiteers expect of her according to ITV&#39;s political correspondent. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cabinet ministers told PM May it&#39;s time to go public with the reality of no deal in which Work and Pensions Minister Rudd said the government needs to be &#39;straight with the British people&#39; and lift lid on implications for national security, according to Telegraph&#39;s Swinford. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBI has warned that the UK risks &quot;crashing out&quot; of 40 trade agreements across five continents in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action was mostly tentative amid the widespread closures and uneventful State of the Union Address, which kept the DXY relatively unchanged at the recently reclaimed 96.00 level, while its major counterparts languished with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1400 to the downside. GBP/USD was also subdued below the 1.3000 handle following weaker than expected Services PMI data and lack of Brexit progress, with PM May said to be seeking a legally binding limit to the backstop which is against what Brexiteers were hoping for. Elsewhere, antipodeans underperformed as AUD/USD slumped on comments from RBA Governor Lowe that the interest rate outlook is more evenly balanced which is in contrast with the central bank&rsquo;s previously held view of the next move likely to be up. This weakened NZD/USD in sympathy and pressured the relevant JPY-crosses, in which USD/JPY followed suit shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Governor Lowe said interest rate outlook is more evenly balanced and that lower rates may be appropriate if unemployment increases and inflation stalls, while he added that there are scenarios when next move in rates is up and scenarios when next move is down. Furthermore, Governor Lowe commented that the board does not view strong case for near term move and that the central bank is in position to maintain current policy while assessing shifts in global economy and household spending. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were relatively unchanged amid a similar muted tone seen across most asset classes which kept WTI crude futures sideways below the USD 54.00/bbl, while the latest API report also failed to spur any significant reaction as inventories didn&rsquo;t deviate much from expectations. Elsewhere, gold was also kept rangebound amid an uneventful greenback and copper marginally extended on the risk-driven gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (1 Feb) 2.514mln vs. Exp. 2.200mln (prev. +2.098mln).

Yields were lower by c.2bps across the curve at settlement. Spreads were mixed with some modest steepening from the belly to the long end and flatter elsewhere. The US Treasury sold USD 38bln in 3yr notes stopping through by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.502%, the lowest since April. Overall a decent auction with the bid-to-cover indicating that demand was close to recent averages. Also, the breakdown showed foreign buyers taking most of the supply, directs were awarded the biggest share since December 2015 and dealers were left with the smallest portion since January. * US T-note futures (H9) settled 5 ticks higher at 121-28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump delivered the State of the Union Address in which he said the state of the union is strong and unemployment has reached its lowest level in half a century. President Trump also noted that he sent a proposal to Congress that includes plans for a physical barrier or wall on the southern border and said that he will get the border wall built, while he also commented that a new trade agreement with China must include end to unfair trade practices, reduce chronic trade deficit and protect American jobs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said Fed should be patient and do nothing on rates until there is greater clarity on economic outlook and financial condition, while he added it is highly appropriate to be open to adjusting balance sheet plan.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded quiet with most bourses in the region closed for holidays, although the few that opened were kept afloat after the gains of their counterparts in US where earnings remained in focus and the S&amp;P 500 notched a 5th consecutive win streak. ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led higher by tech as it mirrored the sector&rsquo;s outperformance stateside, although the index was initially pressured and briefly retreated below the 6000 level amid weakness in financials due to profit taking and after its top component CBA posted a decline in H1 net. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) also benefitted from the tailwinds and with focus centred on earnings releases, which has seen the list of best and worst performing stocks in Japan dominated by recent corporate updates. Finally, price action in 10yr JGBs was contained as the lack of demand due to the positive risk tone in Japan, was counterbalanced by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) also benefits from the tailwinds and with focus centred on earnings releases, which has seen the list of best and worst performing stocks in Japan dominated by recent corporate updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action is mostly tentative amid the widespread closures and with participants awaiting US President Trump&rsquo;s State of the Union Address which has kept the DXY relatively unchanged at the recently reclaimed 96.00 level, while its major counterparts languish with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1400 to the downside. GBP/USD is firmly below 1.3000 following weaker than expected Services PMI data and lack of Brexit progress, with PM May said to be seeking a legally binding limit to the backstop which is against what Brexiteers were hoping for. Elsewhere, antipodeans underperform with AUD/USD slumping on comments from RBA Governor Lowe that the interest rate outlook is more evenly balanced which is in contrast with the central bank&rsquo;s previously held view of the next move likely to be up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price action contained as the lack of demand due to the positive risk tone in Japan, is counterbalanced by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market.</p>\r\n",
