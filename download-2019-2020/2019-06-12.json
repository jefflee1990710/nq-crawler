Micron (MU) sunk on the news that a Chinese company is about to become the China's first mass producer of locally designed DRAM memory chips; the move signals how Beijing is looking to move towards self-sufficiency in core technologies, and as a result, the wider semiconductor sector was also under pressure, including the likes of Applied Materials (AMAT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Microchip Technology (MCHP). Qualcomm (QCOM) were under pressure after news emerged that the chipmaker is facing opposition to its attempts to appeal a sweeping U.S. antitrust decision. Raytheon (RTN) were under pressure on the news that activist investor Ackman opposed its proposed merger with United Technologies (UTX). Facebook (FB) sunk after reports emerged alleging that internal emails showed CEO Zuckerberg and other executives didn't prioritize compliance with the FTC consent decree, and were aware of privacy malpractices. Lam Research (LAM) shares fell pre-market after being downgraded by Evercore ISI. Mattel (MAT) opened higher after reports emerged that the co. had rejected an offer from Bratz doll maker MGA Entertainment last week, and saw more upside after Dealreporter suggested that Hasbro may be eyeing the Co. Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) sunk, nearing 20 year lows, after a judge sought clarification on the drug makers opioid related settlement. McDonalds (MCD), Chipotle (CMG) and Yum Brands (YUM) all moved higher after being recommended by Evercore, who favours fast food. Beyond Meat (BYND) shot higher on fast food chain Tim Horton’s rollout of their burger product. Energy names, including Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), were all under pressure as the crude complex sunk. Investment banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM), were all under pressure after Wells Fargo's Treasurer announced that the Co. sees net interest income at the low end of the previously guided down 2-5% range, meanwhile yield continued their recent fall. S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 2880, NASDAQ-100 -0.6% at 7472, Dow Jones -0.2% at 26008.</p><p>The curve bull-steepened after a slightly soft CPI report resulted in further bets of looser Fed policy. Trump optimism (though a repeat of his comments from this week) saw a small selling. The Treasury sold 10s, which tailed 0.1bps, and sold at the lowest yield since 2016. The internals were also encouraging, and there has been no sign of a collapse in the foreign bid so far at the Treasury auctions, with indirects taking 65.6% (six auction average 61.8%), and up from the 53.3% at the May auction. Cover was also decent at 2.49, above recent averages. At settlement, the 2s30s part of the curve was almost 5bps steeper. On Thursday, the Treasury will sell USD 16bln of 30s; recent auctions in the 30-year sector have tailed. However, TD Securities suggests that curve steepening might provide demand for long-end debt. Recent averages imply a tail of around 0.4bps, with a 74% buy side takedown (14% directs, 60% indirects). T-note futures (M9) settled 6+ ticks higher at 126-20+.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites down, Treasuries up, Dollar up, Crude down.</li><li><strong>REAR VIEW: </strong>US CPI just under expectations; Trump mulling Nord Stream 2 sanctions; Italy looking to delay EU debt procedure; bearish EIA inventories, but not as gloomy as API</li><li><strong>COMING UP:</strong> Data: Australian Employment, German CPI, EZ Industrial Production, US Import &amp; Export Prices, New Zealand Manufacturing PMI.

The year-on-year figure stands at 1.8%, below the expected 1.9%. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlights the faltering US auto industry feeding through to core CPI again, with used car prices falling 1.4% M/M, the fourth consecutive drop. However, it notes that auto prices are likely to flatline now, citing the strong gains following hurricanes in September/October 2018 had led to the recent sharp fall. Nothing was too out of the ordinary in the rest of the breakdown, rents rose less quickly than their extremes in the prior market, and apparel prices were unchanged following recent declines. PM concludes, “Overall, these data show that core CPI inflation is stable at about 2%... we’re expecting a return to 0.2% (M/M) increases.”</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China’s Global Times Editor said China state media will publish more heavyweight commentaries criticizing the US, demonstrating China's determination, and showing Beijing is preparing for China-US ties to worsen. Earlier, US President Trump reiterated his “feeling” for a good deal with China, but also his stance that the next round of tariffs will proceed if no deal is reached. In later trade, he also said that he had no deadline for implementing the next round of tariffs on China, somewhat in contrast of previous comments, where he has said he would be raising tariffs if talks at the G20 between the US and China are unsuccessful. The USTR office said that bifacial solar panels are set to be excluded from the section 201 tariffs on foreign made solar panels. Elsewhere, As Mexico falls in-line with the US’ demands, it announced it would be deploying national guards to its southern border on Wednesday in its efforts to stop immigration; Mexico said it will announce the cost of its new immigration policies on Friday.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>On the US/Iran front; this morning saw a mild injection of optimism regarding a possible de-escalation of US/Iran tensions, as reports emerged that Japan had agreed with Iran to act as a mediator to ease US oil sanctions. This comes amidst Japanese Prime Minister Abe’s two day visit to the Middle Eastern nation; in which he will likely aim to secure Japan’s energy security (Japan have historically been a major export market for Iranian crude) whilst attempting to encourage the US to the negotiating table. On which note, Iranian President Rouhani said that his first meeting with Japanese PM Abe had been successful and that Tehran welcomes improving Japanese ties. Rouhani noted that economic ties between the nations had been a talking point and that Japan is still interested in continuing purchasing Iranian oil. Rouhani did reiterate, however, that Iran will not a start a war, but will defend itself firmly if attacked; on the topic of self-defence, Iran unveiled its Khordad 15th surface-to-air missile system this morning. Also of note on Wednesday; the Saudis, who were the victim of a Yemeni Houthi led attack at their Abha airport this morning, claimed that they had evidence that it had been the Iranian Revolutionary Guards who supplied the Houthis with the weapons to do the job. Elsewhere, US President Trump turned his attention back to Europe, this time with German/Russian ties in his sights; suggesting the US is considering sanctions to block Nord Stream 2 as it puts Germany at risk of depending on Russian energy. On the US/Turkey front, President Erdogan reiterated that the Russian S-400 missile defence system will be delivered next month, but said that he hopes to resolve the F-35 issue with the US ahead of the June G20 meeting.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Commerce Secretary Ross said the Fed should reconsider their last rate increase, which he sees as being premature. This follows on from Trump’s renewed Fed criticism on Tuesday. However, with futures markets pricing in a rate cuts for the year, their wishes may come true regardless of whether government officials had any sway in the Fed’s decisions.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Coalition sources out of Rome on Wednesday reported that the government is looking to convince the EU to delay the decision on the debt procedure until after the summer, believing that Italy's public finances will be better following July's tax revenue data. PM Conte later affirmed this saying that tax revenues and debt cutting will exceed expectations. The sources also suggested that the outgoing European Commission (whose term ends in October) will be somewhat of a sitting duck at the end summer, believing this will give Rome more time to argue its case. If the delay is not possible a procedure could be initiated as soon as June 26th, according to an EU official, with potential fines and scrutiny to be received by Italy.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>A private members bill to stop the future PM from passing through a no deal Brexit was defeated by 309 votes vs. 298, seeing sterling weakness and Gilt strength since it keeps a no-deal scenario alive. Labour’s Brexit policy chief Starmer said after that this would not be the last effort to stop a no-deal and would be using any mechanism available to do so.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB’s Villeroy said that monetary policy must be kept accommodative as long as the EZ is not at its inflation target, and that if conditions worsen the ECB can do more. ECB’s Coeure spoke on APP, saying that it had remained a considerable source of financial easing also after the end of net purchases.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: SNB RATE DECISION Thursday, 13th June at 08:30BST (09:30CET/03:30ET) </strong>SNB is expected to keep policy unchanged with the 3-month Libor target at -0.75%, (range -1.25% and -0.25%); with expectations for standing pat on policy further cemented by the ECB pushing back forward guidance on rates again. For more in depth analysis, <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22051/download\">click here.</a></p><p><strong>* CBRT:</strong> As expected, the CBRT kept rates unchanged. USDTRY fell from 5.8103 to 5.8000 in an immediate reaction. The central bank was always under less pressure to move rates, given that the TRY has appreciated against the USD between the last meeting and today’s meeting, leaving the central bank with less urgency to defend the currency. Analysts have said that in the near-term, the biggest factor for Turkey is its geopolitical dispute with the US over the Russian S-400 missile system.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 126-20+: </strong>The curve bull-steepened after a slightly soft CPI report resulted in further bets of looser Fed policy. Trump optimism (though a repeat of his comments from this week) saw a small selling. The Treasury sold 10s, which tailed 0.1bps, and sold at the lowest yield since 2016. The internals were also encouraging, and there has been no sign of a collapse in the foreign bid so far at the Treasury auctions, with indirects taking 65.6% (six auction average 61.8%), and up from the 53.3% at the May auction. Cover was also decent at 2.49, above recent averages. At settlement, the 2s30s part of the curve was almost 5bps steeper. On Thursday, the Treasury will sell USD 16bln of 30s; recent auctions in the 30-year sector have tailed. However, TD Securities suggests that curve steepening might provide demand for long-end debt. Recent averages imply a tail of around 0.4bps, with a 74% buy side takedown (14% directs, 60% indirects).</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 2.13 LOWER AT USD 51.14/BBL; BRENT (Q9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 2.32 LOWER AT USD 59.97/BBL:</strong> Having sunk overnight in the aftermath of bearish API data (in which the headline showed a surprise 4.9mln bbl build), the crude complex consolidated during US trading hours, before selling off into the close. EIA Inventory Data, which confirmed last night’s API data with a surprise build of its own, caused prices to actually rise given it printed a 2.2mln bbl build due to it being smaller than the API figure. Later, OPEC sources, suggested that Algeria is mulling the idea of an OPEC+ supply cut of 1.8mln BPD in H2, brought a leg up for the complex, but any significant move higher failed to materialise; with desks arguing that the market remains focused on demand side risks, not least in the wake of yesterday’s EIA report, in which 2019 and 2020 global oil demand forecasts were cut. Moreover, desks note that a roll-over of 1.2mln BPD in OPEC+ supply cuts has now been largely baked into expectations, given Russia’s hesitance to a continuation of cuts, an increase in the size of the cuts currently seems unlikely.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 2880, NASDAQ-100 -0.6% at 7472, Dow Jones -0.2% at 26008; SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary -0.1%, Consumer Staples 0.1%, Energy -1.4%, Financials -1%, Health Care 0.5%, Industrials 0.2%, Information Technology -0.6%, Materials 0.3%, Telecommunication Services -0.3%, Utilities 1.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) reversed premarket gains which were spurred from CEO Musk’s positive stoked investor appetite. Micron (MU) sunk on the news that a Chinese company is about to become the China's first mass producer of locally designed DRAM memory chips; the move signals how Beijing is looking to move towards self-sufficiency in core technologies, and as a result, the wider semiconductor sector was also under pressure, including the likes of Applied Materials (AMAT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Microchip Technology (MCHP). Qualcomm (QCOM) were under pressure after news emerged that the chipmaker is facing opposition to its attempts to appeal a sweeping U.S. antitrust decision. Raytheon (RTN) were under pressure on the news that activist investor Ackman opposed its proposed merger with United Technologies (UTX). Facebook (FB) sunk after reports emerged alleging that internal emails showed CEO Zuckerberg and other executives didn't prioritize compliance with the FTC consent decree, and were aware of privacy malpractices. Lam Research (LAM) shares fell pre-market after being downgraded by Evercore ISI. Mattel (MAT) opened higher after reports emerged that the co. had rejected an offer from Bratz doll maker MGA Entertainment last week, and saw more upside after Dealreporter suggested that Hasbro may be eyeing the Co. Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) sunk, nearing 20 year lows, after a judge sought clarification on the drug makers opioid related settlement. McDonalds (MCD), Chipotle (CMG) and Yum Brands (YUM) all moved higher after being recommended by Evercore, who favours fast food. Beyond Meat (BYND) shot higher on fast food chain Tim Horton’s rollout of their burger product. Energy names, including Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), were all under pressure as the crude complex sunk. Investment banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM), were all under pressure after Wells Fargo's Treasurer announced that the Co. sees net interest income at the low end of the previously guided down 2-5% range, meanwhile yield continued their recent fall.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: EUR</strong>: 1.1300 (EURUSD) held up well for most of the session, with price action breaking below in later trade after China’s Global Times editor hinted that China is preparing for a prolonged trade war; on this news, <strong>USD</strong> caught a bid, with DXY moving back up to 97.00. <strong>JPY</strong> was more range-bound, essentially consolidating around 108.50 in US hours. Likewise, <strong>CHF</strong> was fairly flat. <strong>GBP </strong>slipped below 1.2700 after parliament voted down a bill aimed at preventing the next conservative leader from pursuing a no deal Brexit. <strong>AUD</strong> continues to consolidate around 0.6950 ahead of key jobs data overnight that will set the tone for the upcoming RBA. <strong>BRL</strong> saw upside after the govt announced it will use funds from state-owned banks to reduce public debt levels. <strong>ZAR</strong> weaker on news that President Ramaphosa is implicated in an investigation into the donations he received, and prosecutors are investigating whether Ramaphosa deliberately lied to parliament about that donation.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> SocGen notes that the buck is holding up well despite the fall in short-dated yields, of late. It points out that since last year, global growth expectations have declined (from around 3.7% to 3.3%), but expectations of US growth in 2019 has actually risen in that time (to 2.5% from 2.4%). The bank suggests that it is this which is keeping the USD resilient. US President Trump has expressed his unhappiness with the USD’s strength relative to its rivals; SocGen says that “The US has enjoyed more growth than its trading partners and the Fed has raised rates and reversed the growth in its balance sheet. In 1985, US unhappiness ended up with the Plaza accord. A Mar-a-Lago accord isn’t inconceivable.”</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> has ignored the rise in iron ore prices, as well as data showing Aussie consumer confidence fell back to pre-election levels, in spite of the RBA’s recent rate cut; the data is in keeping with the softer tone of releases post the Aussie elections. The 0.6950 level gave way overnight, but we have been consolidating around the area in EZ/US trade, with attention now moving onto the jobs report overnight (+28.4k expects vs +13k previous; jobless rate seen unchanged at 5.2%), and if there is any disappointment, it will likely be used as a justification for the RBA to cut rates further, analysts say.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> China CPI printed 2.7% Y/Y, in line with the consensus. Higher pork and fruit prices underpinned, and could continue to put upward pressure on CPI in the months ahead. High inflation has been one of the reasons why investors are concerned the PBOC would not be dovish enough to support the economy, Morgan Stanley explains. \"The 10-year interest rate differential between China and US is at the widest level since early 2018. However, we believe the PBOC is likely to react to economic data should growth slow down further,\" MS writes. \"The PBOC will support the government’s plan to issue local government special bonds, while our economists expect broad-based RRR cuts in response to rolling-off of MLF and the weaker economy.\" MS says that this should narrow the spreads and lend less support for CNY.</p><p><strong>* INR:</strong> Despite the rise in inflation, analysts still think the RBI is still likely to cut rates further over the months ahead. SocGen’s analysts note that although INR yields have rebounded to over 7.00% from last week’s lows, but daily net foreign inflows are a supporting factor. The bank says the next signpost for INR traders will be how the 5th July budget is received (the first of finance minister Sitharaman).</p>",

Trump optimism (though a repeat of his comments from this week) saw a small selling. The Treasury sold 10s, which tailed 0.1bps, and sold at the lowest yield since 2016. The internals were also encouraging, and there has been no sign of a collapse in the foreign bid so far at the Treasury auctions, with indirects taking 65.6% (six auction average 61.8%), and up from the 53.3% at the May auction. Cover was also decent at 2.49, above recent averages. At settlement, the 2s30s part of the curve was almost 5bps steeper. On Thursday, the Treasury will sell USD 16bln of 30s;<strong> </strong>recent auctions in the 30-year sector have tailed. However, TD Securities suggests that curve steepening might provide demand for long-end debt. Recent averages imply a tail of around 0.4bps, with a 74% buy side takedown (14% directs, 60% indirects).</p>",

Later, OPEC sources, suggested that Algeria is mulling the idea of an OPEC+ supply cut of 1.8mln BPD in H2, bringing a leg up for the complex, but any significant move higher failed to materialise; with desks arguing that the market remains focused on demand side risks, not least in the wake of yesterday’s EIA report, in which 2019 and 2020 global oil demand forecasts were cut. Moreover, desks note that a roll-over of 1.2mln BPD in OPEC+ supply cuts has now been largely baked into expectations, given Russia’s hesitance to a continuation of cuts, an increase in the size of the cuts currently seems unlikely.&nbsp;</p>",

TD Securities points out that the Fed’s portfolio run-ff has slowed to USD 15bln in Treasuries, versus USD 30bln previous, however, with no SOMA maturities in the mid-month, the Fed is set to conduct its add-ons later in the month. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> Last month’s auction was weak, seeing a 1.2bps tail. Investment funds cut their takedown (to 45% from 62% at the previous 10-year auction. Recent averages suggest the auction will stop on the screw, with a 75% buy-side takedown (13% direct, 62% indirect). TD Securities notes that the 10-year trades special in repo, which could signal strong demand at the auction.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/505f205f-41c2-4242-bcb6-07df32ff0858.jpg\"></figure>",

The upshot or inference, although all inflation prints were softer than forecast and previous in several instances the misses were not big enough to alter Fed rate cut probabilities significantly as June FOMC easing remained sub-25% and July just over 80%.</p><p><strong>AUD/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All on course to end the midweek EU session at the bottom of the G10 ranks, and for the Aussie where it has been since Westpac consumer confidence deteriorated overnight. Aud/Usd is still vulnerable just above a Fib around 0.6945 and as the Aud/Nzd cross retreats to 1.0550 from 1.0580 at one stage, as attention switches to Australian jobs data that could prompt the RBA into policy action again after last week’s 25 bp OCR reduction. Similarly, the Franc is erring towards the side caution ahead of tomorrow’s quarterly SNB policy assessment amidst dovish market expectations, with Usd/Chf peering above 0.9950 at one stage and Eur/Chf firm within a 1.1265-25 range. However, the single currency also faded vs the Greenback and retested bids closer to 1.1300 post-US data (after the initial knee-jerk higher), albeit not quite touching 800+ mn option expiries at the big figure.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>Holding up better vs the relatively resilient Usd as the Kiwi nudged back up towards 0.6600, but partly due to the aforementioned Aud/Nzd retracement, while the Yen made further safe-haven progress through 108.50 before meeting some resistance in the form of expiry interest spanning 108.00-10 to 108.25-40 in a total of 2.2 bn. Elsewhere, Cable extended gains beyond 1.2750 as Tory leader front-runner BoJo contended that the EU may return to the Brexit negotiating table before fading and the Loonie regained momentum following a dip under 1.3300 to probe the 1.3275 level where 1.3275 expiries rolled off at the NY cut.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira has pared losses between 5.8280-7660 parameters vs the Buck in wake of the CBRT decision to retain a tightening policy bias and not explicitly shift further towards unwinding hikes even though it expects inflation to continue to slow and more pronounced economic rebalancing. However, the Rand failed to derive much encouragement from significantly stronger than expected SA retail sales as President Ramaphosa became the latest subject of graft investigations and Usd/Zar hovered nearer the upper end of a 19.8445-6360 band.&nbsp;</p>",

Hence, Bunds have backed off further from new 171.62 Eurex highs, while Gilts are just off a deeper 129.90 Liffe low and the underperformance in Short Sterling has also become more pronounced (strip down as much as 6 ticks at one stage). Similarly, the Dollar only dipped briefly post-CPI as the DXY tested, but held just off previous session lows and has subsequently nudged up to a marginal high at 96.807 with the inference that the benign prints are not weak enough to materially alter odds on Fed easing that are still centred on the July FOMC vs June.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Another bearish API data release is seeing energy markets dip lower on Wednesday.</strong> The API reported a surprise build in crude stocks of 4.9mln bbls (exp. -0.5mln), while gasoline stocks came in just above expectations at a build of 0.8mln bbls, and Cushing built above expectations at 2.4mln bbls; however, distillates drew a sizeable 3.5mln bbls (exp. +1.1mln). If last week is anything to go by, the market will likely see another leg lower if the EIA confirms the bearish tone struck by the API as oversupply concerns exacerbate.</li><li>Around a month ago concerns over geopolitical strains were rife in the Persian Gulf following the attacks on various Saudi infrastructure from the Yemen Houthis (which are widely believed to be backed by Iran). However, a deteriorating US-China trade outlook, in addition to signs of faltering global demand, took hold of market sentiment and saw prices tumble. The past few weeks have been somewhat peaceful, but earlier on Wednesday it was reported by Saudi Arabia that the Houthis had made an attack on its Abha airport, with double-digit injuries recorded. There has been muted reaction in the market, but<strong> if more attacks unfold, renewed supply concerns out of the region, on top of extended OPEC+ supply cuts, could prompt the bounce that bulls have been yearning for.</strong></li><li><strong>Goldman Sachs has maintained its Brent forecast for Q3 19 at USD 65.50/bbl, and maintains its WTI 2yr forward forecast at USD 50/bbl.</strong> The bank sees OPEC attempts to balance the market only mildly supportive of prices for the second half of 2019, citing the de-bottlenecking of supply out of the US Permian Basin as a new downside factor. Goldman says that absent weak demand growth, it sees extended supply cuts unlikely next year as this would incentivise higher-cost suppliers to come to market, and “this reinforces our conviction that long-dated prices will need to decline from current levels to limit investment.”</li></ul>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%)</strong> were negative following another net liquidity drain by the PBoC and pessimism regarding the ability to reach a US-China trade deal at the G20, with underperformance in Hong Kong amid increases in money market rates and mass protests outside government buildings in opposition against the controversial extradition bill. Finally, 10yr JGBs kept rangebound with price action hampered by the indecisiveness in the region and amid a lack of BoJ presence in the market today.</p><p><strong>PBoC injected CNY 15bln via 7-day and CNY 20bln via 28-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 25bln.

Subsequently, Iranian officials will ask Japanese PM Abe to act as a mediator to ease oil sanctions, according to reports; and Iran would see any facilitation of oil exports by the US as a gesture of goodwill in the lowering of tensions.

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>European equities are mostly lower [Eurostoxx 50 -0.5%] in a continuation of the subdued lead from Asia in which Hong Kong’s stock index suffered heavy losses due to the mass protests against the controversial extradition bill. Sectors are mixed, with heavy underperformance across energy names (sector -1.2%) amid the slide in oil prices. Meanwhile, defensive sectors (utilities +0.3%, healthcare +0.4%) are in the green as investors flock to the ‘safer’ and more stable stocks. In terms of individual movers, shares in British American Tobacco (-6.0%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 index as the cigarette maker expects global industry volume to fall by around 3.5%, although the Co. reiterated guidance despite its peer Imperial Brands (-1.8%) cutting guidance for their tobacco business yesterday. Elsewhere, shares in Axel Springer (+11.8%) rocketed after KKR’s Traviata confirmed that it is to make a takeover offer for the company for EUR 63/shr (vs. yesterday’s close at EUR 55.85/shr). Meanwhile, SMI’s LafargeHolcim (-3.1%) fell to the bottom of the index after a major shareholder cut his stake in the company.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - The Dollar is on the defensive ahead of US headline inflation data that could provide more justification for the Fed to consider a rate cut, with the index only just holding above chart support ahead of 96.500 in the form of the 200 DMA within a 96.578-722 range.</p><p>JPY/GBP/EUR/CHF - All taking advantage of the softer Greenback, as the Yen rebounds towards 108.00 and into decent option expiry territory with 1 bn sitting between 108.40-25 before a further 1.2 bn from 108.10 down to the big figure. Note, Usd/Jpy has also pared gains on a partial retracement in global stocks as improving risk sentiment wanes, but the Franc has not regained as much safe-haven allure given Thursday’s SNB quarterly policy review and the likelihood of more NIRP and intervention iterations – check out the headline feed or Research Suite for a detailed preview. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf remain above 0.9900 and 1.1200 respectively, with the single currency also consolidating above 1.1300 vs the Dollar and inching closer towards last Friday’s post-NFP highs circa 1.1348 where stops are anticipated, but could be countered by hedges for a 1.2 bn expiry at the 1.1350 strike. Meanwhile, Cable has retested yesterday’s post-UK data/BoE commentary peaks just shy of 1.2750 and Eur/Gbp is pivoting 0.8900 awaiting Tory leadership front-runner BoJo’s official campaign launch.</p><p>NZD/CAD/AUD - Ongoing global trade concerns are undermining the non-US Dollars, as the Kiwi remains capped below 0.6600 and Loonie retreats further from best levels towards 1.3300, and perhaps takes heed of the more pronounced recoil in crude prices having decoupled somewhat in wake of supportive Canadian jobs data and the fillip from the US and Mexico clinching a deal to avert tariffs. However, the Aussie is underperforming in the run up to tomorrow’s labour report and probing key Fib support circa 0.6945.</p><p>EM - Usd/Try is back above 5.8000 amidst latest Turkish remonstrations about the US not adhering to the spirit of alliance on the missile front and reports that an official response to a letter from Washington is being prepared. Meanwhile, the Lira is also looking pressured ahead of the looming CBRT that could turn more dovish given recent inflation data showing a slowdown in CPI, weaker oil and Try appreciation from worst levels – for more see Ransquawk’s headline feed and/or Research Suite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notable FX expiries:</p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.1300 (818M), 1.1325 (726M), 1.1350 (1.2BLN)</p><p>- USD/CAD: 1.3275 (1.1BLN), 1.3325-35 (900M)</p><p>- USD/JPY: 108.00-10 (1.2BLN), 108.25-40 (1BLN), 108.60 (400M), 109.20-30 (800M)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core EU bonds slipped to fresh intraday lows and into negative territory before finding more underlying bids, but haven’t traded in lock-step since as the 10 year benchmarks resume their recent divergent trend. Possibly encouraged by a relatively well received 10 year tap, especially given competition from peripheral and other syndications that are seeing plenty of investor interest, Bunds are back above par in contrast to Gilts hovering just above a 130.13 Liffe low (-9 ticks vs +17 ticks at best). Meanwhile, Short Sterling futures are now down 0.5-2 ticks and have been 2.5 ticks adrift in wake of Tuesday’s toppy AHE ex-bonus outcome and hawkish-leaning BoE utterings, but also amidst the ongoing UK political paralysis pending a new PM and the resumption of Brexit. However, market contacts note decent call option buying in Mar20 where 99.375 and 99.50 strikes have both been purchased in 5k clips. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are holding a firmer and flatter line into CPI and the 10 year note auction after a successful 3 year sale to start this week’s issuance schedule.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Another day of losses for the energy complex with WTI (-2.7%) and Brent (-2.8%) futures heavily pressured amid the latest surprise build in API crude stocks (+4.9mln vs. Exp. -0.5mln) coupled with risk aversion around the market, whilst the EIA’s downgrade in global oil demand forecast only adds to the bearish sentiment. </strong>WTI futures currently hover just above the USD 51.50/bbl level, having dipped below its 200 WMA (52.59) whilst its Brent counterpart briefly fell under the USD 60.50/bbl mark. News flow for the complex has been light thus far with participants now gearing up for the weekly DoEs to potentially reinforce the build in stockpiles seen in the APIs.</p><p>Elsewhere,<strong> gold </strong>(+0.8%) resumes its climb as the recent relief rally dissipated. The yellow metal is comfortably above the USD 1325/oz level ahead of US CPI data. Turning to base metals<strong>, copper</strong> prices are sliding despite a weaker Buck amid the absence of risk appetite in the market, although it is worth noting from a supply point of view that Labour unions at Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine are set to reject the latest wage offer in a vote tomorrow, which could see a operations come to a halt at the largest open pit copper mine. Finally, given the recent supply-driven surge in <strong>iron ore</strong> prices, Chinese <strong>steel mills</strong> are facing a slump in profit margins and are reportedly seeking lower grade iron ore to cut costs, thus the spread between medium and low grade iron ore in China has narrowed to two-and-half year lows.</p><p><strong>UAE Energy Minister Al-Mazrouei</strong> <strong>said OPEC+ is very close to an agreement for an extension</strong>, while he added that current inventories suggest <strong>curb should remain in place</strong> and that the deal should be extended at least until the end of the year. (Newswires)</p><p>CME raised NYMEX Crude Oil July futures margins by 9.5% to USD 3450/contract and raised NY Harbor Heating Oil July futures margins by 7.9% to USD 3775/contract.

Sectors are mixed, with heavy underperformance across energy names (sector -1.2%) amid the slide in oil prices. Meanwhile, defensive sectors (utilities +0.3%, healthcare +0.4%) are in the green as investors flock to the ‘safer’ and more stable stocks. In terms of individual movers, shares in British American Tobacco (-6.0%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 index as the cigarette maker expects global industry volume to fall by around 3.5%, although the Co. reiterated guidance despite its peer Imperial Brands (-1.8%) cutting guidance for their tobacco business yesterday. Elsewhere, shares in Axel Springer (+11.8%) rocketed after KKR’s Traviata confirmed that it is to make a takeover offer for the company for EUR 63/shr (vs. yesterday’s close at EUR 55.85/shr). Meanwhile, SMI’s LafargeHolcim (-3.1%) fell to the bottom of the index after a major shareholder cut his stake in the company.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The Dollar is on the defensive ahead of US headline inflation data that could provide more justification for the Fed to consider a rate cut, with the index only just holding above chart support ahead of 96.500 in the form of the 200 DMA within a 96.578-722 range.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/EUR/CHF</strong> - All taking advantage of the softer Greenback, as the Yen rebounds towards 108.00 and into decent option expiry territory with 1 bn sitting between 108.40-25 before a further 1.2 bn from 108.10 down to the big figure. Note, Usd/Jpy has also pared gains on a partial retracement in global stocks as improving risk sentiment wanes, but the Franc has not regained as much safe-haven allure given Thursday’s SNB quarterly policy review and the likelihood of more NIRP and intervention iterations – check out the headline feed or Research Suite for a detailed preview. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf remain above 0.9900 and 1.1200 respectively, with the single currency also consolidating above 1.1300 vs the Dollar and inching closer towards last Friday’s post-NFP highs circa 1.1348 where stops are anticipated, but could be countered by hedges for a 1.2 bn expiry at the 1.1350 strike. Meanwhile, Cable has retested yesterday’s post-UK data/BoE commentary peaks just shy of 1.2750 and Eur/Gbp is pivoting 0.8900 awaiting Tory leadership front-runner BoJo’s official campaign launch.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong> - Ongoing global trade concerns are undermining the non-US Dollars, as the Kiwi remains capped below 0.6600 and Loonie retreats further from best levels towards 1.3300, and perhaps takes heed of the more pronounced recoil in crude prices having decoupled somewhat in wake of supportive Canadian jobs data and the fillip from the US and Mexico clinching a deal to avert tariffs. However, the Aussie is underperforming in the run up to tomorrow’s labour report and probing key Fib support circa 0.6945.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Usd/Try is back above 5.8000 amidst latest Turkish remonstrations about the US not adhering to the spirit of alliance on the missile front and reports that an official response to a letter from Washington is being prepared. Meanwhile, the Lira is also looking pressured ahead of the looming CBRT that could turn more dovish given recent inflation data showing a slowdown in CPI, weaker oil and Try appreciation from worst levels – for more see Ransquawk’s headline feed and/or Research Suite.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core EU bonds</strong> slipped to fresh intraday lows and into negative territory before finding more underlying bids, but haven’t traded in lock-step since as the 10 year benchmarks resume their recent divergent trend. Possibly encouraged by a relatively well received 10 year tap, especially given competition from peripheral and other syndications that are seeing plenty of investor interest, Bunds are back above par in contrast to <strong>Gilts</strong> hovering just above a 130.13 Liffe low (-9 ticks vs +17 ticks at best). Meanwhile, Short Sterling futures are now down 0.5-2 ticks and have been 2.5 ticks adrift in wake of Tuesday’s toppy AHE ex-bonus outcome and hawkish-leaning BoE utterings, but also amidst the ongoing UK political paralysis pending a new PM and the resumption of Brexit. However, market contacts note decent call option buying in Mar20 where 99.375 and 99.50 strikes have both been purchased in 5k clips. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are holding a firmer and flatter line into CPI and the 10 year note auction after a successful 3 year sale to start this week’s issuance schedule.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Another day of losses for the energy complex with <strong>WTI</strong> (-2.7%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (-2.8%) futures heavily pressured amid the latest surprise build in API crude stocks (+4.9mln vs. Exp. -0.5mln) coupled with risk aversion around the market, whilst the EIA’s downgrade in global oil demand forecast only adds to the bearish sentiment. WTI futures currently hover just above the USD 51.50/bbl level, having dipped below its 200 WMA (52.59) whilst its Brent counterpart briefly fell under the USD 60.50/bbl mark. News flow for the complex has been light thus far with participants now gearing up for the weekly DoEs to potentially reinforce the build in stockpiles seen in the APIs. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> (+0.8%) resumes its climb as the recent relief rally dissipated. The yellow metal is comfortably above the USD 1325/oz level ahead of US CPI data. Turning to base metals, <strong>copper</strong> prices are sliding despite a weaker Buck amid the absence of risk appetite in the market, although it is worth noting from a supply point of view that Labour unions at Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine are set to reject the latest wage offer in a vote tomorrow, which could see a operations come to a halt at the largest open pit copper mine. Finally, given the recent supply-driven surge in <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices, Chinese steel mills are facing a slump in profit margins and are reportedly seeking lower grade iron ore to cut costs, thus the spread between medium and low grade iron ore in China has narrowed to two-and-half year lows.</p>",

However, the stand-off between Beijing and Washington shows little sign of ending ahead of the G20 and oil has been rattled again by another unexpected jump in US crude inventories, while Italian debt is back under pressure ahead of the official EC assessment of the country’s budget policy that could trigger excessive deficit measures. Bunds are also deriving some encouragement from a rebound in US Treasuries and return to flattening ahead of CPI data that alongside retail sales on Friday could tip the Fed into easing mode from the current patient, pause stance with a dovish leaning. No sign of further supply concession, but this could yet manifest into German and US 10 year auctions, though more ECB speakers are slated, including President Draghi, and this may keep bonds underpinned on the prospect of additional stimulus.</p>",

Conversely<strong>, gold</strong> was marginally supported, and copper was subdued amid the cautious risk tone, while <strong>iron ore</strong> outperformed in which <strong>Dalian futures</strong> surged by 4% at the open to hit a fresh record high amid dwindling stockpiles and anticipation of increased demand as well as tight supply.</p><p><strong>API Crude Inventories +4.9mln bbls vs. Exp. -0.5mln bbls (Prev. +3.55mln bbls). (Newswires)</strong> <strong>UAE Energy Minister Al-Mazrouei</strong> <strong>said OPEC+ is very close to an agreement for an extension</strong>, while he added that current inventories suggest <strong>curb should remain in place</strong> and that the deal should be extended at least until the end of the year.

(Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>A roller-coaster session saw the T-Note future slip to 126-07 in European trade, after China stimulus measures stoked risk sentiment; however, the risk tone became more neutral (some desks cited \"fading trade optimism\", although a more distinct and convincing reason for the Treasury bid and the equity downside was more ellusive), the complex slowly grinded its way up towards flat levels by settlement. The 3-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps on cover above recent averages. Crucially, the indirect bid (a proxy for foreign participation) actually rose to 56.6% from 37.9% (average 44.7% over the previous six), which was a relief to the analysts that had expected a weak showing after recent data showed foreign central banks reduced their UST holdings in the latest week by the most since April 2018. Some have speculated that the recent foreign cbank selling might be linked to China selling Treasuries to stem the slide in the yuan since May. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower, with 2s30s coming in by around 3bps, 2s5s flatter by around 2bps. T-note futures (M9) settled unchanged at 126-14.</p>",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) were negative following another net liquidity drain by the PBoC and pessimism regarding the ability to reach a US-China trade deal at the G20, with underperformance in Hong Kong amid increases in money market rates and mass protests outside government buildings in opposition against the controversial extradition bill. Finally, 10yr JGBs kept rangebound with price action hampered by the indecisiveness in the region and amid a lack of BoJ presence in the market today.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) are mixed with Australia kept afloat by mining names as iron prices in China surged to fresh record highs, while the Japanese benchmark mirrors the indecisiveness of its US peers amid a firmer JPY and with SoftBank among the laggards as a group of US states attempt to block the merger between its unit Sprint and T-Mobile. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are negative following another net liquidity drain by the PBoC and wide pessimism regarding the ability to reach a US-China trade deal at the G20, with underperformance in Hong Kong amid mass protests outside government buildings in opposition against the controversial extradition bill.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is uneventful and trades sideways despite the recent softer than expected PPI and renewed criticism by US President Trump on the Fed for rates being too high and for quantitative tightening, with participants awaiting the latest US CPI data later today. The greenback’s major counterparts are also steady with EUR/USD contained near a large option expiry for today’s New York cut at 1.1325 and as GBP/USD holds on to the prior day’s employment- and wage-driven gains. In terms of the latest reports regarding the UK leadership race, Business Minister Clark announced to support Foreign Minister Hunt and Brexit Minister Barclay is to back front-runner Boris Johnson for next PM, while polls have also suggested that the Tory party could win a 140-seat majority at the next general election under the leadership of the bookie favourite.
