Stocks were given a boost above the record closing high after positive noises from the US/China phone call that took place today, though there was some fading in later trade after reports that the US was pushing for tougher language on IP. Next week’s slate is jam packed, including FOMC, NFP, ISM, BOC, BOJ.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>As was hinted at on Thursday, China reportedly asked the US trade team today over the phone not to impose the 15th December tariffs, further reports suggested, and will only then boost US ags purchases to the USD 40-50bln touted in the Phase One trade deal. According to other reports, both are close to finalising some sections of the Phase One deal following the phone call between USTR Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and China’s Vice Premier Liu He, and there will be continuous discussions at the deputy level, while principals will have another call in the near future. Markets were very encouraged by White House Trade Adviser Navarro’s take on the call, after he described it as excellent. Elsewhere, VP Pence’s speech was not received very enthusiastically in China, particularly the human rights aspects, and has some – who are bullish on US/China talks – a little concerned. China described parts of his speech as “lies,” and told the US to get its own house in order with regards to income inequality and racism. A combination of both stories keeps risks of the Phase One unravelling before a text can be agreed and signed at the mid-November APEC summit, analysts said.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The primary catalyst for how Brexit unfolds in the short/medium-term is centred around how long of an extension the EU will offer the UK. France reportedly wants a shorter extension (some reports suggest through to the end of November) while other EU nations are happy to go with the end-January 2020 date, as had been mandated by the Benn Act. Simply, a longer extension makes the chances of a UK election higher, a shorter extension would apply pressure to lawmakers to push through Johnson’s WAB speedily, though potential amendments complicates the situation. EU Ambassadors are to meet on Monday to decide the length. See our <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23085/download\">Week in Focus</a> for more detailed analysis.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN OCTOBER IFO: </strong>A mixed report, where the business climate indicator held steady, though at a low level, and is generally consistent with the recent PMI data signalling the German economy had a tough start at the start of Q4. Current conditions fell, but the expectations component improved. Capital Economics said that the data, overall, confirmed its view that the German economy will continue to shrink into 2020, especially given the limited fiscal stimulus announced by the government recently.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 3022, NASDAQ-100 0.8% at 8029, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.6% at 26956; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.2%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; -0.5%, Energy&nbsp; 0.8%, Financials&nbsp; 0.5%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.2%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.6%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1.2%, Materials&nbsp; 1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.7%, Utilities&nbsp; -1.1%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Amazon (AMZN) traded lower initially after Q4 revenue forecasts came in below street expectations, and AWS revenue fell slightly short. Its core metrics, Adj. EPS and revenue did beat, although non-adjusted did miss by a fair amount. Intel (INTC) led the performance in DJI to end the week after top and bottom line beats and a beat in FY EPS; INTC announced a USD 20bln share repurchase programme. Charter Communications (CHTR) rallied after EPS and revenue beats, it also announced it is working with Comcast (CMCSA) on a potential new streaming device. Visa (V) beat on EPS and revenues and announced a 20% dividend increase, which saw the name higher on Friday. Illumina (ILMN) traded lower despite EPS and revenue beats, and a raise in guidance. As it’s microarrays sales, were soft sparking worries on consumer genomics.&nbsp; Revenue growth was also expected at 8% in Q4, which is beneath analyst expectations. Other desks have noted that the big beat was driven by the Qiagen licensing agreement and other elements, which was responsible for the raised guidance. Gilead (GILD) earnings were in line with expectations, although analysts note there are concerns about near term growth prospects. Note, its CEO expressed interest in NASH and cancer assets at the market open, with the co. potentially eyeing Intercept Pharma (ICPT). Mohawk (MHK) surged after an EPS beat.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) were lower as South Korea grounded 9 737 NG planes as it found structural cracks in the jets following a request from the US FAA to investigate older jets for said cracks. Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG) were halted after falling >20% as another fire broke out in California, PCG noted they were currently undergoing a Public Safety Power Shut off, with Citibank noting this fire increases the chances that the utility company goes to zero. Dick’s Sporting Good’s (DKS) traded in the green after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. Facebook (FB) talks with states on privacy probe settlement have reportedly stalled, though shares were little moved on the news.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLE 10 TICKS LOWER AT 129-17: </strong>At settlement, the curve had bear-flattened, shaking off an early risk-off feeling; downside today was sponsored by constructive chatter after a phone call between US/China negotiators, which even trade hawk Navarro described as ‘excellent’. The complex did find a modest bid in quiet afternoon trade, as equities faded from near-record highs, perhaps also aided later by news that trade advisor Navarro was pushing for tougher language on IP protections. Next week, the complex will take more cues from the fundamental side of the equation, with FOMC, NFP and ISMs on tap; currently, markets are pricing with near certainty a 25bps rate cut to 1.50-1.75%; key will be how the Fed guides after it has completed its ‘insurance cuts’; currently, money markets imply easing of a 29bps into year end (just over one cut priced), and 57bps of cuts is priced through end-2020 (implying just over 2 rate cuts by the end of next year, include the potential cut on Wednesday)</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.43 HIGHER AT USD 56.66; BRENT (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.35 HIGHER AT USD 62.02: </strong>Oil<strong> </strong>benchmarks traded sideways on Friday after a week of gains, settling above their September 13th closing levels, the Friday prior to the Abqaiq drone attacks, which Citi analysts suggest proves that the event ultimately influenced the market’s balance. Supply factors have had more impetus on the energy markets this week, where US inventories reported a surprise build, North Sea Buzzard oilfield had more disruptions, though in afternoon trader, it was announced that pipework defect has been repaired and production safely resumed; OPEC+ chatter of deeper production cuts and global shipping rates lowering from their extreme levels following US sanctions on Chinese shipper COSCO. Rabobank highlights the short oil position as crowded trade among CTAs, giving credence to the view of short covering supporting oil prices this week as demand concerns took a back seat; looking forward, the bank speculates further upside as momentum and trend signals turn positive, seeing CTAs go long. Baker Hughes Rig Count showed US Oil rigs -17 at 696, a record 11th consecutively monthly cut), gas rigs -4 at 133, leaving total rigs -21 at 830.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:&nbsp; EUR, GBP: </strong>Both ending the week on the back foot vs the Dollar and for the most part trading in tandem if not quite lock-step. However, the Euro is much closer its highs against the Pound as an encouraging German Ifo survey compensates somewhat for another bleak set of preliminary PMIs, while Sterling succumbs to more Brexit and UK political uncertainty. In sum, PM Johnson succeeded where his predecessor failed 3 times by getting his version of a WAB over the Parliamentary line, but the HoC blocked his Programme Motion designed to fast-track legislation and meet the October 31 deadline and also resisted his latest attempt to call a snap election. Meanwhile, the EU has yet to respond or decide whether to grant the Benn extension request for a further Article 50 delay to January 2020, with France especially dragging its heels and reportedly more inclined to a shorter prolongation to mid/end of November. The upshot could be some form of compromise, such as a flextension and the latest from Brussels points to an announcement next Monday or Tuesday, which coincides with PM Johnson’s intention to invoke the FTPA for a December 12 GE probably on Monday. Back to the single currency, ECB President Draghi’s final act was largely a non-event, as widely expected following the big stimulus package unfurled in September, but he did underline the rationale for the measures, clarify GC division and opinion over various elements and reiterate the unanimous view that Governments need to take the strain by loosening the fiscal reins. <strong>JPY, DXY: </strong>The Yen has largely tracked Greenback moves on broader fluctuations in risk sentiment on US-China/global trade and geopolitical developments in the absence of much Japanese-centric drivers and with markets closed on Tuesday. Usd/Jpy has been relatively rangebound between 108.75-25 and currently closer to the top as the US Dollar index nudges over 97.800 to a marginal new 97.816 wtd peak, mainly as a by-product of counterpart currency weakness, but also in wake of firmer than forecast Markit PMIs yesterday. <strong>AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>The Aussie and Kiwi have been on another roller-coaster ride and dovetailing each other on fluctuating cross-flows and more repositioning after RBA minutes and RBNZ guidance indicating pauses in rates after recent easing. Aud/Usd has held above 0.6800, albeit some distance from best levels and Aud/Nzd is back over 1.0700, as Nzd/Usd loses altitude towards 0.6350 having relinquished 0.6400. Conversely, the Loonie is maintaining bullish momentum even though Canadian data ahead of next week’s BoC policy meet has been somewhat disappointing, as the Q3 BoS was more robust/upbeat and investors seemed to be relieved if not enthused by PM Trudeau’s re-election. <strong>CHF: </strong>The Franc was bereft of independent inspiration and hostage to moves elsewhere after weekly Swiss sight deposits at the start of the week revealed a decline in balances after a run of intervention style rises. Usd/Chf is probing new peaks around 0.9940 alongside the Buck overall as noted above, <strong>NOK, SEK, TRY, RUB, BRL, ZAR: </strong>The Scandi Crowns and Turkish Lira all featured in a Central Bank bonanza on Thursday, though to varying degrees as the Riksbank confounded expectations with a more hawkish twist and refined timeframe for a repo hike (December rather than end of 2019/early next year previous indication), but then softened the blow via a lower rate path and caveat to ease monetary policy via conventional and/or non-standard policy if the Swedish economy deteriorates. Next up, a bland unchanged assessment and on hold Norges Bank before the CBRT grabbed headlines with a whopping 250 bp cut and accompanying statement suggesting more easing to come based on weaker than anticipated inflation developments and CPI outlook. The CBR followed suit with a 50 bp rate reduction vs -1/4 point forecast in keeping with the cycle prior to that (-75 bp in total before October) and also delivered dovish guidance based on inflation undershooting target and soft CPI ahead of the meeting. Elsewhere, Brazil’s Real derived traction from Senate approval of the pension reform bill with some less detracting amendments attached and the Rand was bulled up by positive technical impulses and long positioning ahead of the SA budget with provisions for Eskom eagerly awaited. <strong>YUAN: </strong>Some late gains for the Cnh amidst reports from US officials suggesting the Phase 1 trade deal phone call with Chinese peers went very well, with Navarro even using the word 'excellent'.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Both ending the week on the back foot vs the Dollar and for the most part trading in tandem if not quite lock-step. However, the Euro is much closer its highs against the Pound as an encouraging German Ifo survey compensates somewhat for another bleak set of preliminary PMIs, while Sterling succumbs to more Brexit and UK political uncertainty. In sum, PM Johnson succeeded where his predecessor failed 3 times by getting his version of a WAB over the Parliamentary line, but the HoC blocked his Programme Motion designed to fast-track legislation and meet the October 31 deadline and also resisted his latest attempt to call a snap election. Meanwhile, the EU has yet to respond or decide whether to grant the Benn extension request for a further Article 50 delay to January 2020, with France especially dragging its heels and reportedly more inclined to a shorter prolongation to mid/end of November. The upshot could be some form of compromise, such as a flextension and the latest from Brussels points to an announcement next Monday or Tuesday, which coincides with PM Johnson’s intention to invoke the FTPA for a December 12 GE probably on Monday. Back to the single currency, ECB President Draghi’s final act was largely a non-event, as widely expected following the big stimulus package unfurled in September, but he did underline the rationale for the measures, clarify GC division and opinion over various elements and reiterate the unanimous view that Governments need to take the strain by loosening the fiscal reins.</p><p><strong>JPY/DXY</strong></p><p>The Yen has largely tracked Greenback moves on broader fluctuations in risk sentiment on US-China/global trade and geopolitical developments in the absence of much Japanese-centric drivers and with markets closed on Tuesday. Usd/Jpy has been relatively rangebound between 108.75-25 and currently closer to the top as the US Dollar index nudges over 97.800 to a marginal new 97.816 wtd peak, mainly as a by-product of counterpart currency weakness, but also in wake of firmer than forecast Markit PMIs yesterday.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi have been on another roller-coaster ride and dovetailing each other on fluctuating cross-flows and more repositioning after RBA minutes and RBNZ guidance indicating pauses in rates after recent easing. Aud/Usd has held above 0.6800, albeit some distance from best levels and Aud/Nzd is back over 1.0700, as Nzd/Usd loses altitude towards 0.6350 having relinquished 0.6400. Conversely, the Loonie is maintaining bullish momentum even though Canadian data ahead of next week’s BoC policy meet has been somewhat disappointing, as the Q3 BoS was more robust/upbeat and investors seemed to be relieved if not enthused by PM Trudeau’s re-election.</p><p><strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc was bereft of independent inspiration and hostage to moves elsewhere after weekly Swiss sight deposits at the start of the week revealed a decline in balances after a run of intervention style rises. Usd/Chf is probing new peaks around 0.9940 alongside the Buck overall as noted above,</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/TRY/RUB/BRL/ZAR</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns and Turkish Lira all featured in a Central Bank bonanza on Thursday, though to varying degrees as the Riksbank confounded expectations with a more hawkish twist and refined timeframe for a repo hike (December rather than end of 2019/early next year previous indication), but then softened the blow via a lower rate path and caveat to ease monetary policy via conventional and/or non-standard policy if the Swedish economy deteriorates. Next up, a bland unchanged assessment and on hold Norges Bank before the CBRT grabbed headlines with a whopping 250 bp cut and accompanying statement suggesting more easing to come based on weaker than anticipated inflation developments and CPI outlook. The CBR followed suit with a 50 bp rate reduction vs -1/4 point forecast in keeping with the cycle prior to that (-75 bp in total before October) and also delivered dovish guidance based on inflation undershooting target and soft CPI ahead of the meeting. Elsewhere, Brazil’s Real derived traction from Senate approval of the pension reform bill with some less detracting amendments attached and the Rand was bulled up by positive technical impulses and long positioning ahead of the SA budget with provisions for Eskom eagerly awaited.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>YUAN</strong></p><p>Some late gains for the Cnh amidst reports from US officials suggesting the Phase 1 trade deal phone call with Chinese peers went very well, with Navarro even using the word 'excellent'.</p>",

(+0.4%)</strong> were subdued despite the PBoC’s liquidity efforts that resulted to a net injection of CNY 560bln this week, with weakness seen in financials and participants cautious as earnings season in the region began to pick up. There were also recent mixed comments from US Vice President Pence who suggested the US will continue to seek better relations with China and that if the sides can get an economic relationship right, they can make progress on other issues, although he noted the curtailing of rights and liberties in Hong Kong and criticized US businesses for kowtowing to Beijing.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Major European Bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.3%) are mostly lower amid a lack of fresh drivers, with most indices well within yesterday’s ranges. Dax and Euro Stoxx 50 (cash) both made fresh YTD highs this week; fears of a no deal Brexit have faded substantially and earnings, by and large, have not been as bad as feared. Sectors are mixed, with some divergence seen in the consumer sectors; Consumer Discretionary (+0.9%) outperforms after luxury apparel maker Kering’s (+9.9%) earnings topped expectations, while Consumer Staples (-1.0%) lags, with poor AB InBev () earnings weighing on beverage makers. In terms of other individual movers; Michelin (+3.5%), WPP (+5.8%), LafargeHolcim (+2.0%) and Moncler (+8.5%) were all buoyed by strong earnings. Moreover, Barclays (+0.9%) results were firm; the bank beat on top line expectations, including healthy CIB revenue, and adjusted pretax posted firm Q/Q gains. Despite a GBP 1.4bln provision for compensating customers caught up in the PPI mis-selling scandal, Barclay shares rose to the highest since November 2018. Conversely, Capgemini (-6.7%), Eni (-1.0%) and MTU Aero Engines (-1.5%) earnings were poor, seeing their stocks come under pressure.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> The single currency has extended its recovery from sub-1.1100 lows vs the Dollar in wake of October’s German Ifo readings that were broadly better anticipated and prompted the institute to conclude that the economy may be finding a base, with modest growth likely in Q4. However, Eur/Usd still looks leggy between decent option expiries (1.5 bn from 1.1090 to 1.1100 and 1 bn at 1.1150-55) and a broadly firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 97.500 within a 97.573-712 range following Thursday’s encouraging US Markit PMIs.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK -</strong> The G10 outliers, with the Aussie outperforming vs US and NZ counterparts after holding above 0.6800 and reclaiming 1.0700+ status respectively, while the Kiwi has lost more momentum below 0.6400. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are retreating further from best levels seen in the immediate aftermath of yesterday’s Riksbank policy declaration about a probable rate hike in December on the assumption that it will be one more and done akin to the Norges Bank after September’s 25 bp tightening. Eur/Nok is nudging 10.1900 and also being driven by the aforementioned incremental Euro incline, while Eur/Sek has been back above 10.7500 compared to just under 10.6500 at one stage on Thursday.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY/GBP -</strong> All narrowly mixed against the Buck, as the Franc pares some losses from 0.9930, but remains below 0.9900 and the Loonie meanders between 1.3060-75 ahead of Canadian budget balance updates for August due later. Meanwhile, the Yen is holding within 108.70-57 parameters and even the Pound is relatively restrained due to less Brexit buffeting (for now), as Cable pivots 1.2850 and Eur/Gbp straddles 0.8650.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Central Bank vibes in play, as the Lira concedes more ground after the CBRT’s 250 bp rate cut and Turkish President Erdogan piles on the pressure for further aggressive easing via a single digit call for the benchmark 1 week repo vs 14% at present. Usd/Try has touched 5.7900 before paring back, but the Rouble seems to be taking a widely expected CBR cut in stride ahead of the 11.30BST decision even though weaker than forecast inflation opens the door to -1/2 point after 3 cuts of 25 bp in a row. Usd/Rub sub-64.0000.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.1050 (865M) <strong>1.1090-1.1100 (1.5BLN), 1.1150-55 (1BLN),</strong> 1.1165-75 (835M), 1.1200 (500M), 1.1225-30 (800M), 1.1240-50 (1.2BLN)</p><p>- USD/CAD: <strong>1.3000-20 (1.7BLN),</strong> 1.3100 (425M), 1.3120 (366M), 1.3150-55 (750M)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Debt futures have halted their post-Ifo declines, but remain depressed after hitting fresh intraday lows of 171.35 for Bunds, 132.29 for Gilts and 129-24+ for the 10 year US T-note at the end of a hectic week of Brexit, US-China/global trade and geopolitical headline-watching. Moreover, the supply pipeline has been heavy, albeit well received on the US-side especially and stocks have performed strongly, albeit not closely correlated with bonds in the traditional or classic inverse asset manner. Ahead, final Michigan sentiment is unlikely to rock the boat, but pre-weekend squaring may impact and at some stage fixed traders could begin to position for month end with a lengthy Eurozone extension for October.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Crude futures</strong> are marginally lower in uninspired trade amid a lack of fresh fundamental developments and look set to end the week on a firmer footing; the key driver of Crude’s strong performance this week was a surprise draw in EIA inventories on Wednesday, slightly over 10mln bbls in total. Additionally, further disruptions to the North Sea Buzzard Oil field and a temporary shutdown to the Forties Pipeline System also lent support. WTI futures have made substantial strides from early October lows, with the Dec’ 19 future currently residing just shy of the USD 56.00/bbl mark, while Brent sits at the USD 61.50/bbl mark. The USD 50.50/bbl – USD 51.00/bbl region for WTI, a quadruple bottom for June, August and early October, remains impenetrable for now. Though demand side concerns continue to cap gains, as evidenced by crude’s inability to hold on to last month’s post Aramco attack related gains, geopolitical risk premia remains ever present, as does the prospect for further OPEC+ cuts (sources hinted at the latter earlier in the week, although Russia’s Novack played things down). Metals are similarly lacklustre; <strong>Gold</strong> yesterday reclaimed the USD 1500/oz mark and sits below USD 1510/oz. Copper, meanwhile, hold on to decent gains for the week, supported by unrest and strikers in Chile that has affected supply of the red metal.</p><p>US to deploy additional military assets to safeguard Syrian oil, according to Pentagon.

Dax and Euro Stoxx 50 (cash) both made fresh YTD highs this week; fears of a no deal Brexit have faded substantially and earnings, by and large, have not been as bad as feared. Sectors are mixed, with some divergence seen in the consumer sectors; Consumer Discretionary (+0.9%) outperforms after luxury apparel maker Kering’s (+9.9%) earnings topped expectations, while Consumer Staples (-1.0%) lags, with poor AB InBev () earnings weighing on beverage makers. In terms of other individual movers; Michelin (+3.5%), WPP (+5.8%), LafargeHolcim (+2.0%) and Moncler (+8.5%) were all buoyed by strong earnings. Moreover, Barclays (+0.9%) results were firm; the bank beat on top line expectations, including healthy CIB revenue, and adjusted pretax posted firm Q/Q gains. Despite a GBP 1.4bln provision for compensating customers caught up in the PPI mis-selling scandal, Barclay shares rose to the highest since November 2018. Conversely, Capgemini (-6.7%), Eni (-1.0%) and MTU Aero Engines (-1.5%) earnings were poor, seeing their stocks come under pressure.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> The single currency has extended its recovery from sub-1.1100 lows vs the Dollar in wake of October’s German Ifo readings that were broadly better anticipated and prompted the institute to conclude that the economy may be finding a base, with modest growth likely in Q4. However, Eur/Usd still looks leggy between decent option expiries (1.5 bn from 1.1090 to 1.1100 and 1 bn at 1.1150-55) and a broadly firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 97.500 within a 97.573-712 range following Thursday’s encouraging US Markit PMIs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK -</strong> The G10 outliers, with the Aussie outperforming vs US and NZ counterparts after holding above 0.6800 and reclaiming 1.0700+ status respectively, while the Kiwi has lost more momentum below 0.6400. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are retreating further from best levels seen in the immediate aftermath of yesterday’s Riksbank policy declaration about a probable rate hike in December on the assumption that it will be one more and done akin to the Norges Bank after September’s 25 bp tightening. Eur/Nok is nudging 10.1900 and also being driven by the aforementioned incremental Euro incline, while Eur/Sek has been back above 10.7500 compared to just under 10.6500 at one stage on Thursday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY/GBP -</strong> All narrowly mixed against the Buck, as the Franc pares some losses from 0.9930, but remains below 0.9900 and the Loonie meanders between 1.3060-75 ahead of Canadian budget balance updates for August due later. Meanwhile, the Yen is holding within 108.70-57 parameters and even the Pound is relatively restrained due to less Brexit buffeting (for now), as Cable pivots 1.2850 and Eur/Gbp straddles 0.8650.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Central Bank vibes in play, as the Lira concedes more ground after the CBRT’s 250 bp rate cut and Turkish President Erdogan piles on the pressure for further aggressive easing via a single digit call for the benchmark 1 week repo vs 14% at present. Usd/Try has touched 5.7900 before paring back, but the Rouble seems to be taking a widely expected CBR cut in stride ahead of the 11.30BST decision even though weaker than forecast inflation opens the door to -1/2 point after 3 cuts of 25 bp in a row. Usd/Rub sub-64.0000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Debt futures have halted their post-Ifo declines, but remain depressed after hitting fresh intraday lows of 171.35 for Bunds, 132.29 for Gilts and 129-24+ for the 10 year US T-note at the end of a hectic week of Brexit, US-China/global trade and geopolitical headline-watching. Moreover, the supply pipeline has been heavy, albeit well received on the US-side especially and stocks have performed strongly, albeit not closely correlated with bonds in the traditional or classic inverse asset manner. Ahead, final Michigan sentiment is unlikely to rock the boat, but pre-weekend squaring may impact and at some stage fixed traders could begin to position for month end with a lengthy Eurozone extension for October.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Crude futures</strong> are marginally lower in uninspired trade amid a lack of fresh fundamental developments and look set to end the week on a firmer footing; the key driver of Crude’s strong performance this week was a surprise draw in EIA inventories on Wednesday, slightly over 10mln bbls in total. Additionally, further disruptions to the North Sea Buzzard Oil field and a temporary shutdown to the Forties Pipeline System also lent support. WTI futures have made substantial strides from early October lows, with the Dec’ 19 future currently residing just shy of the USD 56.00/bbl mark, while Brent sits at the USD 61.50/bbl mark. The USD 50.50/bbl – USD 51.00/bbl region for WTI, a quadruple bottom for June, August and early October, remains impenetrable for now. Though demand side concerns continue to cap gains, as evidenced by crude’s inability to hold on to last month’s post Aramco attack related gains, geopolitical risk premia remains ever present, as does the prospect for further OPEC+ cuts (sources hinted at the latter earlier in the week, although Russia’s Novack played things down). Metals are similarly lacklustre; <strong>Gold</strong> yesterday reclaimed the USD 1500/oz mark and sits below USD 1510/oz. Copper, meanwhile, hold on to decent gains for the week, supported by unrest and strikers in Chile that has affected supply of the red metal.</p>",

(Twitter/Global Times)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>MPs have approved the Queen's Speech, which sets out Boris Johnson's priorities for the parliamentary session, by 310 votes to 294. (BBC)</strong></p><p><strong>UK PM Johnson is calling for an election on December 12th under the fixed term parliament act which would need 2/3 of MPs (434) to vote in favour</strong>, while it was also reported the government is to table motion for GE on Monday and that Parliament can still study and pass the WAB, as long as they agree to the proposed election. The government was said to have threatened to go on strike if the opposition refuses the election on Monday and it also officially pulled the November 6th budget. (Twitter/The Sun) <strong>UK opposition party Labour is to reject PM Johnson’s offer for an early election and is said to have told Labour MPs to abstain on Monday's election vote but later stated they will back a general election if a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table</strong>. Scotland First Minister Sturgeon is also said to have asked Labour leader Corbyn to back a snap winter election in a secret meeting. (The Sun/Sky)</p><p><strong>EU is considering UK PM Johnson’s call to get Parliament onboard for 12 December election and might wait to announce its decision on length of new Brexit extension on Monday</strong>, while a separate report also noted that EU27 envoys are unlikely to decide on Brexit delay today and may decide on Monday or Tuesday but are seeking more clarity. (Newswires/BBC)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> remained firm and sat near this week’s best levels following recent encouraging US data in which Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and Services PMI printed inline. The <strong>greenback</strong> had also benefitted from weakness across its major counterparts including <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which briefly gave up the 1.1100 handle. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was lacklustre amid ongoing political stalemate with UK PM Johnson now calling for an election on 12th December and warned the government will go on a strike if the opposition Labour Party refuses, although its leader Corbyn remained unwilling to back an election until a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was uneventful amid a light calendar and mixed risk-tone, while antipodeans traded lacklustre and were restricted by a firm greenback.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were uneventful overnight with trade hampered by the lacklustre risk appetite which saw <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures pullback from resistance at the USD 56.50/bbl level to trade slightly below 56.00/bbl, with a lack of fresh supply or demand factors also contributing to its loss of steam. <strong>Gold</strong> held on to most the prior day’s above the USD 1500/oz level despite recent strength in the greenback with the precious metal benefitting from some touted positioning ahead of next week’s FOMC where markets are pricing an over 90% probability the Fed will lower rates again, while copper traded sideways due to the mixed sentiment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The T-Note again traded sideways in the lacklustre session, at least from a risk appetite perspective. The much feared/anticipated VP Pence speech on China took a rather balanced stance and provided no further indication for participants on how the trade war will pan out. The ECB was also a non-event given the last meeting’s fireworks. Earnings were mixed too, seeing equity bourses edge slightly higher, again little to sway participants either in or out of the debt complex. The US 7-year auction was fairly solid, stopping through by 0.7bps, covering above the 6-auction average, with a strong takedown, too – although the TPLEX didn’t blink. US T-note (Z9) settled half a tick lower at 129.27.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equities traded mixed with a lack of conviction amid the absence of any firm macro drivers and as earnings releases remained centre stage. ASX 200 (+0.7%) outperformed led by gold miners after the precious metal reclaimed the psychological USD 1500/oz level and with broad gains seen across sectors amid recent currency weakness, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was choppy and stalled after reaching its highest level in over a year with continued losses in SoftBank amid speculation of a USD 5bln write down to its Vision Fund. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were subdued despite the PBoC’s liquidity efforts that resulted to a net injection of CNY 560bln this week, with weakness seen in financials and participants cautious as earnings season in the region began to pick up. There were also recent mixed comments from US Vice President Pence who suggested the US will continue to seek better relations with China and that if the sides can get an economic relationship right, they can make progress on other issues, although he noted the curtailing of rights and liberties in Hong Kong and criticized US businesses for kowtowing to Beijing. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy as they mirrored the indecisiveness in Japan and with demand subdued by a lack of BoJ buying in the market today.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equities trade mixed with the region lacking conviction amid the absence of any firm macro drivers and as earnings releases remain centre stage. ASX 200 (+0.7%) outperforms led by gold miners after the precious metal reclaimed the psychological USD 1500/oz level and with broad gains seen across its sectors amid recent currency weakness, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) is choppy and has stalled after reaching its highest level in over a year with continued losses seen in SoftBank amid speculation of a USD 5bln write down to its Vision Fund. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are subdued despite the PBoC’s liquidity efforts resulting to a net injection of CNY 560bln this week, with weakness seen across financials and as earnings season in the region also begins to pick up. There were also recent mixed comments from US Vice President Pence who suggested the US will continue to seek better relations with China and that if the sides can get an economic relationship right, they can make progress on other issues, although he also noted the curtailing of rights and liberties in Hong Kong and criticized US businesses for kowtowing to Beijing.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firm and sits near this week’s best levels following recent encouraging US data in which Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and Services PMI printed inline. The greenback had also benefitted from weakness across its major counterparts including EUR/USD which briefly gave up the 1.1100 handle after a miss on Eurozone and German PMI data, with comments from ECB Draghi’s final press conference not providing much help as he noted risks remain on the downside but reiterated calls for fiscal measures. GBP/USD is lacklustre amid ongoing political stalemate with UK PM Johnson now calling for an election on 12th December and warning the government will go on a strike if the opposition Labour party refuses, although its leader Corbyn remains unwilling until a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are uneventful amid a light calendar and mixed risk-tone, while antipodeans trade lacklustre and are restricted by a firm greenback.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand dampened by the indecisiveness in Japan and lack of BoJ buying in the market today.</p>",
