The opposition Labour Party tabled a motion of no confidence in the government; debate will take place at 1300 GMT on Wednesday, with a vote scheduled for 1900 GMT. May spokesperson said the PM believes she has the confidence of the House (indeed, the coalition partner DUP has pledged to support the Prime Minister, as has the ERG group of Conservative Party Brexiteers, suggesting there is a very good chance May survives). If however May loses the confidence vote, then she will have fourteen days to attempt to regain the confidence of the House. The PM&rsquo;s spokesperson also suggested that May does not necessarily agree that Article 50 will now have to be extended; a Welt reporter, citing several EU sources, said EU27 leaders would be ready to extend Article 50 until the end of June. Officially, the EU called on the UK to clarify its position and intentions as soon as possible, noting that the risk of a disorderly Brexit has now increased; the EU also stated tat the deal is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Politico reported that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to return to Washington for talks at the end of this month. In comments, Senator Grassley said that US Trade Representative Lighthizer saw little progress in last week&#39;s talks with China on structural issues and IP protections; he added that Lighthizer made positive comments to him at the Friday&#39;s meeting regarding Chinese soybean purchases. Elsewhere, Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said that now is the time to continue working energetically on having the US metals tariffs removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED DISCOUNT MINUTES:</strong> Half of the Fed&#39;s 12 regional banks voted to leave the discount rate unchanged in December, votes came just ahead of FOMC decision to hike rate in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dovish) sees no need to tap the brakes on the economy as long as inflation is low; he added that monetary policy is not meant to be political and he noted the historic 3.9% would be full-employment. He stressed that Fed&rsquo;s rate hikes in 2019 will depend on data. So far, he has not seen investment boom in the real economy. Fed&rsquo;s George (Voter, Hawkish) shifted from its usual hawkish stance and stated that it &quot;might be a good time to pause&quot; on rate hikes as the Fed should be patient and more cautious. He believes rates are not yet at neutral but are close. He noted it is unclear whether and how much the balance sheet runoff is removing accommodation. He stated the rate-setting panel will be data dependent at their meeting in two weeks; he said the Fed always has to be ready to pivot and needs to continually reassess how its balance sheet affects the economy. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Dovish, Non-voter) reiterated that due to many risks, Fed would be &quot;wise&quot; to hold off on further policy action. He warned that global growth is decelerating posing a risk to the US economy; further risks include weakness in interest sensitive industries and tightening financial conditions. He believes an extended govt shutdown would weigh on consumer spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB President Draghi (Dovish) highlighted that recent economic developments have been weaker than forecasts while uncertainties, especially related to global factors, remain prominent. He believes significant amount of monetary policy stimulus is still needed, but stated the present stance is very accommodative already. The snapshot still shows consumption and investment expanding, export less but still good and strong labour market. He believes the economy is currently experiencing a slowdown and is not heading towards a recession, though this could be longer than previously expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NY FED MANUFACTURING </strong>fell sharply in January to 3.9 from 10.9, missing the 10.75 consensus; prior month&rsquo;s print was revised marginally higher to 11.5. The index has pulled back significantly from the levels around 20 seen in the previous months, but not yet near weakness seen in 2015/16 around -2.5. Analysts at UBS attributed the softer data to higher tariffs and expect the drag to hit growth temporarily. They also note that recent disappointing Chinese trade data translates into &ldquo;less factory inputs and activity here, consistent with the recent deterioration in manufacturing surveys&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PPI</strong> fell by 0.2% from the previous +0.1%, a slightly larger drop than the expected -0.1%. Headline price index was steady at 2.5% y/y and the core rate was unchanged at 2.7% y/y. Energy prices weighed on this reading falling 0.2% amid the slump in Q4; goods prices were down 0.4% unchanged from November. On the flip side food prices climbed 2.6% from 1.3%. Analysts at Wells Fargo argue that &ldquo;while the government shutdown may delay the release of the FOMC&rsquo;s preferred inflation measure later this month, the PPI and CPI suggest core PCE remains close to 2.0%&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLES USD 1.60 HIGHER AT USD 52.11/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.65 HIGHER AT USD 60.64/BBL. </strong>Crude traded higher on Tuesday after overnight news that China would boost fiscal stimulus in order to counteract slowing economic growth momentum, which helped support risk assets. In European trading hours, the complex was lifted on reports that East Libyan forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar were heading to the South in order to try and secure oil sites to protect domestic and foreign oil firms, with the move expected to alarm officials in Tripoli; earlier in the session, Libyan oil and non-oil ports were said to be closed due to bad weather. In trade news, the first US crude cargoes since last September are heading to China this week. Also in newsflow, CNBC reports suggested the Trump administration still might let Iran export oil, which could lower prices while considering an embargo on Venezuelan crude. Elsewhere, the EIA forecasts 2019 world oil demand growth by 20k BPD to 1.54mln BPD, 2020 world oil demand to hit 103.07mln, up 1.53mln BPD from 2019; it also sees 2019 US crude oil output to rise by 1.14mln BPD to 12.07mln BPD (prev. 1.18mln BPD) and 2020 US crude oil outputs to rise by 790,000 BPD to 12.86mln BPD in its firsts 2020 forecast. After the bell on Tuesday, the API will report weekly inventories ahead of Wednesday EIA report; this week, the Street looks for headline crude stocks to draw by 1.3mln, Cushing stocks are expected to build 0.9mln (according to Genscape), distillates are seen building 1.6mln, while gasoline is expected to build by 2.8mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.07% at 2610, NDX +1.97% at 6670, DJI +0.65% at 24065. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.30%, Materials -0.64%, Industrials -0.32%, Cons Discretionary +1.13%, Cons Staples +0.98%, Healthcare +1.74%, Financials +0.81%, Tech +1.48%, Telecoms +1.74%, Utilities +1.27%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> DJIA heavyweight, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), beat both EPS and revenue estimates causing it to trade higher. Financials&rsquo; earnings reports today saw JPMorgan (JPM) dip lower after missing EPS estimates, as well as Wells Fargo (WFC) after it missed revenue estimates. Netflix (NFLX) lead the FAANG stocks on announcements of price increases to its US subscribers. Microsoft (MSFT) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) outperformed following the announcement of a digital healthcare services partnership. Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edward Lifesciences (EW) moved higher after they agreed to dismiss all patent litigation. PG&amp;E (PCG) continued its decline as the market digests its bankruptcy filing. Sherwin Williams (SHW) opened lower after lowering its guidance, Home Depot (HD) also suffered on the back of this. Albemarle (ALB) underperformed after a downgrade at Nomura. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT) dipped lower in later trade after it announced disappointing sales for its Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) UNCHANGED AT 131-90.</strong> Treasuries ended Tuesday&rsquo;s section mixed; the complex continued to edge higher at the European open amid soft growth data in Germany and ahead of the Brexit vote. The complex remained unreactive to worse than expected Fed Mfg and PPI data as well as cautious comments from ECB&rsquo;s President Draghi on the economy. Yields turned negative as Parliament begun to vote on PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal where PM May suffered the biggest defeat since 1920. Treasuries however pared back gains heading into the close and ended Tuesday&rsquo;s session on the unchanged mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>More bang for the buck as the dollar advanced further above 95.500 having commenced the session below the figure. DXY continued to creep higher throughout the session and came in close proximity to 96.000 after Parliament rejected UK PM May&rsquo;s plan and after the release of the Fed discount minutes later today. DXY briefly retested 95.750 to the downside, before recouping to around 95.800 as US Senator Grassley highlighted little progress in US-Sino trade talks on key sticking points such as IP, citing USTR Lighthizer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR:</strong> GBP had rose to above 1.29 overnight ahead of the Brexit vote, however, fell all the way back to 1.27 before voting got underway; when the initial rejection came through, GBP fell in a knee jerk reaction, however, GBP then pared back losses to move towards flat for the session as traders reasoned that the rejection of May&rsquo;s deal along with a Parliament committed to leaving the EU with a deal lessens the chance of a disorderly, no-deal Brexit, and the rejection of May&rsquo;s deal compels lawmakers to explore other options and models. Meanwhile, the EUR bore the brunt of the strengthening greenback alongside the release of German annual GDP which printed in-line with forecasts at 1.50% Y/Y, the weakest performance in five years with market participants noting that a German technical recession could have been narrowly missed (with the Q4 release scheduled on 14th Feb). AS US participants entered the market, EUR/USD declined to levels just shy of 1.1410 (vs high of 1.1491), taking out its 100 DMA (1.1474) along the way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>The high-beta currencies mitigated Dollar-induced losses on the back of rising commodities as AUD/USD trading close to 0.7200 and NZD/USD remained north of its 200 and 50 DMAs at 0.6795 and 0.6793 and tested resistance at 0.68500. Meanwhile, the Loonie was heavily influenced by energy price action and felt a gush of tailwind as oil posted gained in excess of a dollar. Subsequently, USD/CAD fell through 1.3250 at one point to an intraday low of around 1.3230, taking out its 100 HMA (1.3245) on the way. USD/CAD currently sitting around 1.38270.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF:</strong> Both dominated on by the buck rather than experiencing an unwind in risk premium. USD/JPY tested 108.75 at one point before a pullback in the dollar sent the pair lower to test resistance at 108.35 ahead of its 50 and 200 DMA just below the resistance level. Similarly, albeit to a slightly greater extent, USD/CHF tested 0.9870 to the upside. The currency pair resided in close proximity to its 100 and 200 DMA at 0.9878 and 0.9889 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>The marked G10 outperformers as the Scandi Crown benefitted from a weaker EUR while the NOK took impetus from the rising oil prices and the SEK followed suit. EUR/NOK declined further below 9.80 with the double-whammy sent the pair lower to test its 50DMA at 9.7437 (vs. high of 9.8089). Over in Sweden, following yesterday&rsquo;s inflation figures (where the CPIF printed above expectation), Riksbank board member Jochnick emerged on the wires to state that the Swedish inflation will remain around their 2% target and added that the Central Bank can tolerate fluctuations around this target. SEK however was largely unmoved by the comments and derived most of its impetus from the EUR. EUR/SEK declined lost the 10.25 level and tested 10.22 at one point before paring back some downside to stabilise just under 10.24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In European trading hours, the complex was lifted on reports that East Libyan forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar were heading to the South in order to try and secure oil sites to protect domestic and foreign oil firms, with the move expected to alarm officials in Tripoli; earlier in the session, Libyan oil and non-oil ports were said to be closed due to bad weather. In trade news, the first US crude cargoes since last September are heading to China this week. Also in newsflow, CNBC reports suggested the Trump administration still might let Iran export oil, which could lower prices while considering an embargo on Venezuelan crude. Elsewhere, the EIA forecasts 2019 world oil demand growth by 20k BPD to 1.54mln BPD, 2020 world oil demand to hit 103.07mln, up 1.53mln BPD from 2019; it also sees 2019 US crude oil output to rise by 1.14mln BPD to 12.07mln BPD (prev. 1.18mln BPD) and 2020 US crude oil outputs to rise by 790,000 BPD to 12.86mln BPD in its firsts 2020 forecast. After the bell on Tuesday, the API will report weekly inventories ahead of Wednesday EIA report; this week, the Street looks for headline crude stocks today 1.5mln, Cushing stocks are expected to build 0.9mln (according to Genscape), distillates are seen building 1.5mln, while gasoline is expected to build by 3.2mln.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Wrap: Sterling eyes May’s vote as a rising Dollar weighs on most G10s ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; More bang for the buck as the dollar advanced further above 95.500 having commenced the session below the figure. DXY continued to creep higher throughout the session and came in close proximity to 96.000 at one point (high of 95.941) ahead of the downbeat US PPI release wherein a forecast-miss in the Final Demand M/M and the super-core figures sent the index lower to test 95.750 before stabilising around 95.800 ahead of the release of the Fed discount minutes later today. DXY briefly retested 95.750 to the downside, before recouping to around 95.800 as US Senator Grassley highlighted little progress in US-Sino trade talks on key sticking points such as IP, citing USTR Lighthizer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; Sterling had its guard up ahead of the looming meaningful vote defeat PM May is expected to face. Regarding the latest, the UK House Speaker did not select the Murrison and Swire amendments (which sets an expiry date for the Northern Irish backstop), he did however select four other amendments: Labour, SNP, Leigh and Baron. Labour leader Corbyn&rsquo;s amendment will be voted on shortly after 1900GMT, followed by the other three ahead of the meaningful vote between 2000GMT and 2100GMT. According to the Sun&rsquo;s Political Editor, Senior Tories believe the Premier is poised for a 150-160 vote defeat tonight, while Sky analysis believes that the UK Government are to lose the meaningful vote by 226 votes. Thus, against the backdrop of a rising buck, Cable retreated further below 1.2900 &nbsp;to print fresh a intra-day low at 1.2826 ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.2813 and 1.2800 the figure. Meanwhile, the EUR also bore the brunt of the strengthening greenback alongside the release of German annual GDP which printed in-line with forecasts at 1.50% Y/Y, the weakest performance in five years with market participants noting that a German technical recession could have been narrowly missed (with the Q4 release scheduled on 14th Feb). AS US participants entered the market, EUR/USD declined to levels just shy of 1.1410 (vs high of 1.1491), taking out its 100 DMA (1.1474) along the way. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD </strong>&ndash; The high-beta currencies mitigated Dollar-induced losses on the back of rising commodities as AUD/USD reclaimed .0.7200 to the upside and NZD/USD remained north of its 200 and 50 DMAs at 0.6795 and 0.6793 and tested resistance at 0.68500. Meanwhile, the Loonie was heavily influenced by energy price action and felt a gush of tailwind as oil posted gained in excess of a dollar. Subsequently, USD/CAD fell through 1.3250 to an intraday low of around 1.3230, taking out its 100 HMA (1.3245) on the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong>- Both dominated on by the buck rather than experiencing an unwind in risk premium as participants eye developments in Westminster ahead of PM May&rsquo;s meaningful vote. USD/JPY tested 108.75 at one point before a pullback in the dollar sent the pair lower to test resistance at 108.35 ahead of its 50 and 200 DMA just below the resistance level. Similarly, albeit to a slightly greater extent, USD/CHF tested 0.9870 to the upside shortly before the greenback pulled back. The currency pair resided in close proximity to its 100 and 200 DMA at 0.9878 and 0.9889 respectively .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOK, SEK</strong> &ndash; The marked G10 outperformers as the Scandi Crown benefitted from a weaker EUR while the NOK took impetus from the rising oil prices and the SEK followed suit. EUR/NOK declined further below 9.80 with the double-whammy sent the pair lower to test its 50DMA at 9.7437 (vs. high of 9.8089). Over in Sweden, following yesterday&rsquo;s inflation figures (where the CPIF printed above expectation), Riksbank board member Jochnick emerged on the wires to state that the Swedish inflation will remain around their 2% target and added that the Central Bank can tolerate fluctuations around this target. SEK however was largely unmoved by the comments and derived most of its impetus from the EUR. EUR/SEK declined lost the 10.25 level and tested 10.22 at one point before paring back some downside to stabilise just under 10.24.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, risk appetite improved overnight with both ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) positive, in which the latter recovered from early selling pressure as it initially tracked the prior day&rsquo;s losses on return from its long weekend. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) and Hang Seng (+2.0%) were underpinned amid a deluge of comments from Chinese agencies including the Finance Ministry which stated that China will implement larger tax and fee cuts, while the NDRC said China will continue implementing proactive fiscal policies. In addition, the PBoC conducted a respectable liquidity injection of CNY 180bln but expects a rapid decline of banking liquidity in the approaching days, while there were also hopes for an improvement in the trade environment after reports that super tankers carrying 6mln bbls of crude left the Texas coast and are likely heading to China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as the gains in stocks sapped demand for safe-havens and following the recent similar pressure in T-notes, but with losses stemmed amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 1tln of JGBs with maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day and CNY 100bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 180bln.

Furthermore, PBoC Deputy Governor Zhu said prudent policies does not mean there will be no changes and that prudent policies should remain in line with economic conditions, while Zhu also commented they will encourage banks to lend more to small firms.

Opposition for the amendment comes from Labour leadership believing that it&rsquo;s passage would offer PM May the opportunity to pull her deal, therefore sparing her a crushing defeat.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are relatively flat [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%] as equity markets gave up initial gains post German FY GDP of +1.5%. Marginal underperformance is seen in the FTSE MIB (-0.2%) where banking names such as UBI Banca (-5.7%), Bper Banca (-4.3%) and Banco BPM (-3.8 %) are at the bottom of the index following the ECB asking Italian banks to set aside additional money to fully cover impaired loans by 2026. Sectors are similarly all in the green, with outperformance in materials and industrials. Other notable movers include gambling names after the US Justice Department stated that all online gambling is now illegal; as such William Hill (-1.6%) and Paddy Power (-1.8%) are in the red. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Provident Financial (-18.0%) following the Co stating that they expect 2018 profits to report towards the lower end of market expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Choppy session for the Pound thus far as traders eye the long-awaited House of Commons meaningful vote scheduled for later today (full schedule available on the headline feed), as PM May attempts to accumulate MP backing to pass her deal. According to the Sun&rsquo;s Political Editor, Senior Tories believe the Premier is poised for a 150-160 vote defeat tonight, though a list of amendments will be released at the start of the Parliamentary session around 12.45GMT with special focus on Murrison amendment (setting an expiry date of 31st December 2021 to the NI backstop) as a way of snatching a narrow defeat. Tory Brexiteers and the DUPs are known to not support a deal which includes a timeless backstop or a unilateral exit clause, Murrison&rsquo;s amendment seeks to readdress this and if passed, may shore up some support from the rebels, DUP are said to have rejected this amendment in belief the EU will not be bound by the expiry date. Earlier in the day Hilary Benn&rsquo;s amendment was pulled out amid the opposition leaders&rsquo; desire for PM May to suffer a crushing defeat (the amendment, if it was to be passed, would have rejected the withdrawal agreement, convey a lack of support for no deal and pave the way for MPs to put forward alternative plans for Brexit). As such, Cable pared back overnight gains and gave up the 1.2900 handle to test the psychological (and 50 HMA) at 1.2850 to the downside and currently resides at the bottom of a 1.2831-1.2915 intraday range. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley assumes that Cable at current levels is pricing in a lot of uncertainty and assumes GBP/USD to reach 1.30 in around 6-month and 1.50 by year-end as Cable&rsquo;s PPP fair value estimate stands at 1.40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, DXY &ndash; EUR largely on the backfoot amid a strengthening Dollar and following the release of German annual GDP which printed in-line with forecasts at 1.50% Y/Y, the weakest performance in five years with market participants noting that a German technical recession could have been narrowly missed (with the Q4 release scheduled on 14th Feb). EUR/USD sits around the bottom of a 1.1423-91 band ahead of a double-Draghi day, his first speech however provided little in way of monetary policy commentary. Back to the dollar, DXY received a wave of demand shortly after the German numbers with DXY spiking to highs of around 95.900 from overnight lows of 95.450 with State-side news flow on the light side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF &ndash; Conforming more to the bout of dollar strength rather than an unwind in safe-haven positions with both USD/JPY and USD/CHF higher by around 0.4% on the day ahead of the Brexit meaningful vote. USD/JPY advances further above 108.00 after having reclaimed the handle during overnight trade and currently resides nearer to the top of a 108.15-75 range ahead of a Fib a 109.16 with little to report on the options expiry front. Similar action with the Franc as USD/CHF breached 0.9850 to the upside ahead of its 100 and 200 DMAs at 0.9878 and 0.9889 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD, CAD &ndash; High beta currencies also bear the brunt of a rising buck, though price action in the commodities complex have somewhat underpinned the antipodeans, though the Loonie feels the headwinds of easing oil prices. AUD/USD briefly reclaimed the 0.7200 handle after breaching the its 50 DMA and HMA at 0.7193 and 0.7203 to the upside while NZD/USD remains north of 0.6820 (just about) as its 50 and 200 DMAs are still poised to form a golden cross below just below 0.6800. Finally, USD/CAD trades above its 100 DMA at 1.3245 and in close proximity to its 50 HMA at 1.3223 as the pair trades near the middle of a 1.3244-85 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU fixed income trades tentatively and is marginally positive as Bunds are marginally outperforming their UK counterparts (+30 ticks) with the German benchmark gaining a little bit of steam after the country posted their worst annual GDP figures since 2013 (1.5% YY), whilst the stats office stated that Q4 posted a marginal gain. In the periphery, BTP futures have turned around a negative start and moved into positive territory (+2 ticks) following the announcement from the Italian Treasury that initial price guidance on their 2033 bond is at 20-22bps. European traders will now be looking ahead to two upcoming speeches by ECB head Draghi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the vote on UK PM May&rsquo;s deal at 7pm Gilt futures are stable around the 123.00 mark and trade within a 31-tick range, with traders mindful of any more indications of backing or lambasting of the deal by MPs, with the DUP having given no indication of support yet. Rumblings of a Labour no-confidence vote have also picked up, with MP Benn pulling his amendment that paves the way for a no-confidence vote today. With expectations firmly set on a loss for the Prime Minister, lawmakers have suggested that should this be a heavy one, a resignation by the British PM should be anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are in the green and seeing similar rangy price action with most of the action in the long of the curve. 10-yr futures are stable around the 122-00 mark after the first Fed comments of the week last night from Fed&rsquo;s Clarida, who reaffirmed that the Fed can be &ldquo;very patient&rdquo;. Further Fed speak can be expected today from Kashkari, Kaplan and George after the start of big US bank earnings kicked off by JPM, with traders mindful of the ongoing Government shutdown with lawmakers set to meet with President Trump today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.7%) and WTI (+1.6%) are higher as the risk tone improves from the Chinese-trade sparked downturn seen in yesterday&rsquo;s session, with prices just under the USD 60/bbl and USD 51/bbl respectively. Focus is on the API weekly release later in the day, where crude oil inventories are expected to have declined by 2.5mln/bbl; separately, the EIA are to release their Short-Term Energy Outlook today which contains their expanded forecast discussion. Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih says he sees oil demand growth for the foreseeable future, and that the 1.2mln BPD OPEC+ cut will have a strong impact which will take some time to be reflected within the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.1%) prices are down as the demand for safe havens has declined with the improvement in risk sentiment; with the yellow metal trading towards the bottom of its USD 5/oz range. Elsewhere, the US Senate are to begin voting today on a resolution which criticises the Trump administration&rsquo;s decision to reduce sanctions on companies which are connected to Russian oligarch Deripaska; which includes aluminium company Rusal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih says he sees growth in oil demand for the foreseeable future.

Underperformance is seen in the FTSE MIB (-0.6%) where banking names such as UBI Banca (-9.6%), Bper Banca (-6.8%) and Banco BPM (-8.6%) are at the bottom of the index following the ECB asking Italian banks to set aside additional money to fully cover impaired loans by 2026. Sectors are similarly all in the green, with outperformance in materials and industrials. Other notable movers include gambling names after the US Justice Department stated that all online gambling is now illegal; as such William Hill (-0.9%) and Paddy Power (-4.0%) are in the red. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Provident Financial (-17.7%) following the Co stating that they expect 2018 profits to report towards the lower end of market expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Choppy session for the Pound thus far as traders eye the long-awaited House of Commons meaningful vote scheduled for later today (full schedule available on the headline feed), as PM May attempts to accumulate MP backing to pass her deal. According to the Sun&rsquo;s Political Editor, Senior Tories believe the Premier is poised for a 150-160 vote defeat tonight, though between 10:30 and 11:30 GMT, a list of voteable amendments with special focus on Murrison amendment (setting an expiry date of 31st December 2021 to the NI backstop) as a way of snatching a narrow defeat. Tory Brexiteers and the DUPs are known to not support a deal which includes a timeless backstop or a unilateral exit clause, Murrison&rsquo;s amendment seeks to readdress this and if passed, may shore up some support from the rebels, DUP are said to have rejected this amendment in belief the EU will not be bound by the expiry date. Earlier in the day Hilary Benn&rsquo;s amendment was pulled out amid the opposition leaders&rsquo; desire for PM May to suffer a crushing defeat (the amendment, if it was to be passed, would have rejected the withdrawal agreement, convey a lack of support for no deal and pave the way for MPs to put forward alternative plans for Brexit). As such, Cable pared back overnight gains and gave up the 1.2900 handle to test the psychological (and 50 HMA) at 1.2850 to the downside and currently resides at the bottom of a 1.2850-1.2915 intraday range. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley assumes that Cable at current levels is pricing in a lot of uncertainty and assumes GBP/USD to reach 1.30 in around 6-month and 1.50 by year-end as Cable&rsquo;s PPP fair value estimate stands at 1.40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, DXY &ndash;EUR largely on the backfoot amid a strengthening Dollar and following the release of German annual GDP which printed in-line with forecasts at 1.50% Y/Y, the weakest performance in five years with market participants noting that a German technical recession could have been narrowly missed (with the Q4 release scheduled on 14th Feb). EUR/USD sits around the bottom of a 1.1423-91 band ahead of a double-Draghi day, his first speech however provided little in way of monetary policy commentary. Back to the dollar, DXY received a wave of demand shortly after the German numbers with DXY spiking to highs of around 95.900 from overnight lows of 95.450 with State-side news flow on the light side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF &ndash; Conforming more to the bout of dollar strength rather than an unwind in safe-haven positions with both USD/JPY and USD/CHF higher by around 0.4% on the day ahead of the Brexit meaningful vote. USD/JPY advances further above 108.00 after having reclaimed the handle during overnight trade and currently resides nearer to the top of a 108.15-75 range ahead of a Fib a 109.16 with little to report on the options expiry front. Similar action with the Franc as USD/CHF stabilises in close proximity to 0.9850 to the upside ahead of its 100 and 200 DMAs at 0.9878 and 0.9889 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD, CAD &ndash; High beta currencies also bear the brunt of a rising buck, though price action in the commodities complex have somewhat underpinned the antipodeans, though the Loonie feels the headwinds of easing oil prices. AUD/USD reclaimed the 0.7200 handle after breaching the its 50 DMA and HMA at 0.7193 and 0.7203 to the upside while NZD/USD remains north of 0.6820 as its 50 and 200 DMAs are still poised to form a golden cross below just below 0.6800. Finally, USD/CAD trades above its 100 DMA at 1.3245 and in close proximity to its 50 HMA at 1.3223 as the pair trades near the middle of a 1.3244-85 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU fixed income trades tentatively and is marginally positive as Bunds are marginally outperforming their UK counterparts (+30 ticks) with the German benchmark gaining a little bit of steam after the country posted their worst annual GDP figures since 2013 (1.5% YY), whilst the stats office stated that Q4 posted a marginal gain. In the periphery, BTP futures have turned around a negative start and moved into positive territory (+2 ticks) following the announcement from the Italian Treasury that initial price guidance on their 2033 bond is at 20-22bps. European traders will now be looking ahead to two upcoming speeches by ECB head Draghi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the vote on UK PM May&rsquo;s deal at 7pm Gilt futures are stable around the 123.00 mark and trade within a 31-tick range, with traders mindful of any more indications of backing or lambasting of the deal by MPs, with the DUP having given no indication of support yet. Rumblings of a Labour no-confidence vote have also picked up, with MP Benn pulling his amendment that paves the way for a no-confidence vote today. With expectations firmly set on a loss for the Prime Minister, lawmakers have suggested that should this be a heavy one, a resignation by the British PM should be anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are in the green and seeing similar rangy price action with most of the action in the long of the curve. 10-yr futures are stable around the 122-00 mark after the first Fed comments of the week last night from Fed&rsquo;s Clarida, who reaffirmed that the Fed can be &ldquo;very patient&rdquo;. Further Fed speak can be expected today from Kashkari, Kaplan and George after the start of big US bank earnings kicked off by JPM, with traders mindful of the ongoing Government shutdown with lawmakers set to meet with President Trump today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.9%) and WTI (+0.9%) are higher as the risk tone improves from the Chinese-trade sparked downturn seen in yesterday&rsquo;s session, with prices just under the USD 60/bbl and USD 51/bbl respectively. Focus is on the API weekly release later in the day, where crude oil inventories are expected to have declined by 2.5mln/bbl; separately, the EIA are to release their Short-Term Energy Outlook today which contains their expanded forecast discussion. Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih says he sees oil demand growth for the foreseeable future, and that the 1.2mln BPD OPEC+ cut will have a strong impact which will take some time to be reflected within the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.2%) prices are down as the demand for safe havens has declined with the improvement in risk sentiment; with the yellow metal trading towards the bottom of its USD 5/oz range. Elsewhere, the US Senate are to begin voting today on a resolution which criticises the Trump administration&rsquo;s decision to reduce sanctions on companies which are connected to Russian oligarch Deripaska; which includes aluminium company Rusal.</p>\r\n",

In the periphery, BTP futures have turned around a negative start and moved into positive territory (+15 ticks) following the announcement from the Italian Treasury that initial price guidance on their 2033 bond is at 20-22bps. European traders will now be looking ahead to two upcoming speeches by ECB head Draghi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the vote on UK PM May&rsquo;s deal at 7pm Gilt futures are stable around the 123.00 mark and trade within a 31-tick range, with traders mindful of any more indications of backing or lambasting of the deal by MPs, with the DUP having given no indication of support yet. Rumblings of a Labour no-confidence vote have also picked up, with MP Benn pulling his amendment that paves the way for a no-confidence vote today. With expectations firmly set on a loss for the Prime Minister, lawmakers have suggested that should this be a heavy one, a resignation by the British PM should be anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are in the green and seeing similar rangy price action with most of the action in the belly of the curve. 10-yr futures are stable around the 122-00 mark after the first Fed comments of the week last night from Fed&rsquo;s Clarida, who reaffirmed that the Fed can be &ldquo;very patient&rdquo;. Further Fed speak can be expected today from Kashkari, Kaplan and George after the start of big US bank earnings kicked off by JPM, with traders mindful of the ongoing Government shutdown with lawmakers set to meet with President Trump today.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, risk appetite improved overnight with both ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) positive, in which the latter recovered from early selling pressure as it initially tracked the prior day&rsquo;s losses on return from its long weekend. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) and Hang Seng (+1.6%) were underpinned amid a deluge of comments from Chinese agencies including the Finance Ministry which stated that China will implement larger tax and fee cuts, while the NDRC said China will continue implementing proactive fiscal policies. In addition, the PBoC conducted a respectable liquidity injection of CNY 180bln but expects a rapid decline of banking liquidity in the approaching days, while there were also hopes for an improvement in the trade environment after reports that super tankers carrying 6mln bbls of crude left the Texas coast and are likely heading to China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as the gains in stocks sapped demand for safe-havens and following the recent similar pressure in T-notes, but with losses stemmed amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 1tln of JGBs with maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day and CNY 100bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 180bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7542 (Prev. 6.7560)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC said it will make monetary policy more forward-looking, flexible and targeted, while it added that it will not make monetary policy too tight nor too loose and that it expects banking liquidity to decline rapidly in approaching days. Furthermore, PBoC Deputy Governor Zhu said prudent policies does not mean there will be no changes and that prudent policies should remain in line with economic conditions, while Zhu also commented they will encourage banks to lend more to small firms. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Finance Ministry said will implement larger tax and fee reductions, while it added the government will reduce general expenditures by over 5%. There were also comments from Vice Finance Minister Xu that detailed tax cuts will be included in government work report or budget plan. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NDRC said China will strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments in its macro policies, while it will also implement larger tax and fee cuts this year, as well as ease funding difficulties for small and private firms. Furthermore, NDRC Vice Chairman Lian said China will speed up investment projects and local bond issuances but will not resort to flood-like stimulus.

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Labour MP Benn is to pull amendment this morning as part of an effort by Labour party to table vote of no confidence this evening. The amendment, if passed, would reject the withdrawal agreement, convey a lack of support for no deal and pave the way for MPs to put forward alternative plans for Brexit. Opposition for the amendment comes from Labour leadership believing that it&rsquo;s passage would offer PM May the opportunity to pull her deal, therefore sparing her a crushing defeat.

The consensus remains for parliament to vote against PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal and some have even suggested a potential no-confidence vote against the government or that PM May will be expected to stand down if she is heavily defeated, although there were also reports that German Chancellor Merkel has offered certain last minute assistance and that PM May is considering a 2nd vote on the Brexit deal if the first one is rejected. Elsewhere, antipodeans were lifted with AUD/USD back at the 0.7200 handle, amid the improvement in risk appetite which also underpinned USD/JPY and JPY-crosses due to safe-haven outflows from the JPY.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly higher with the improvement in risk tone overnight driving price action, which saw WTI crude futures pare most the prior day&rsquo;s losses to trade back above the USD 51.00/bbl level, while focus for the energy complex now shifts to the upcoming API inventory report later today. Elsewhere, copper was also underpinned by the rebound in sentiment, which conversely kept gold subdued due to lack of safe-haven demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised NatGas Henry Hub futures margins to USD 4200 from USD 3600 per contract.

Furthermore, it was also reported that US Secretary of State Pompeo may conduct talks this week with North Korea.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as sentiment in the region recovers from the recent China-triggered weakness, in which slowdown concerns following disappointing trade data from the world&rsquo;s 2nd largest economy weighed on global sentiment and saw the US majors post their first consecutive loss for the year. Nonetheless, risk appetite has improved overnight with both ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) in the green, with the latter recovering from early selling pressure as it initially tracked the prior day&rsquo;s losses on return from its long weekend. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) is kept afloat and Hang Seng (+1.5%) outperforms amid a deluge of comments from Chinese agencies including the Finance Ministry which stated that China will implement larger tax and fee reductions, while the NDRC said China will continue implementing proactive fiscal and prudent monetary policies. In addition, PBoC conducted a respectable liquidity injection of CNY 180bln but expects a rapid decline of banking liquidity in the approaching days, while there are also hopes for an improvement in the trade environment after reports that supertankers carrying 6mln bbls of crude left the Texas coast and are likely heading to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is slightly subdued with the DXY stuck near the 95.50 level as its major counterparts eke mild gains, with GBP/USD just about reclaiming the 1.2900 handle ahead of today&rsquo;s key Brexit deal vote. The consensus remains for parliament to vote against PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal and some have even suggested a potential no-confidence vote against the government or that PM May will be expected to stand down if she is heavily defeated, although there were also reports that German Chancellor Merkel has offered PM May certain last minute assistance and that PM May is considering a 2nd vote on the Brexit deal if the first one is rejected. Elsewhere, antipodeans are lifted with AUD/USD reclaiming the 0.7200 handle amid the improvement in risk appetite, which has also underpinned USD/JPY and JPY-crosses due to safe-haven outflows from the JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued as the gains in stocks sap demand for safe-havens and following the recent similar pressure in T-notes, but with losses stemmed amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 1tln of JGBs with maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n",
