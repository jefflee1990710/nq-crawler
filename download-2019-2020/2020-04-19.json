(Newswires/Sky News)</p><p>BoE Governor Bailey stated that global policy makers at the IMF meeting showed a very clear commitment to do what is necessary and the OBR scenario of a 35% decline in UK GDP in second quarter is not implausible. Bailey added that the MPC will set out its view clearly in May on how much \"scarring\" the UK economy is facing and cannot currently say how long the Central Bank will hold onto purchased Gilts for.

Bullard commented the upcoming FOMC meeting will be a good time to review the impact of programmes so far and is not expecting much on forward guidance at the meeting as the story is about the virus and not rates. Bullard also noted&nbsp; that one thing that the Fed could do in its next statement is emphasize that data right now isn't meaningful and that the Fed should be careful about the next steps and reserve some firepower for clearly identified problems, while he suggested it is unlikely the Fed would move to purchase equities and not sure it would have much impact anyway given the size and liquidity of the US market.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks firmed on news after-market Thursday that a COVID-19 vaccine is close (despite the drugmaker Gilead stating there were anecdotal reports did not provide statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the drug as a treatment). Additionally, the news that Boeing is set to restart commercial jets production, following on from similar updates at European manufacturers such as Daimler, Volkswagen and Volvo. Stocks pared back some of the initial enthusiasm; equities that benefited from 'stay at home' underperformed amid talk of global economies re-opening. In terms of the strategies, high dividend shares did well on Friday after lagging for much of the week; momentum strategies have generally performed well this week, although lagged on Friday; value strategies had a decent session, although they are still down on the week. Gilead (GILD) remdesivir was reported to have made rapid progress in treating severe COVID-19 patients in Chicago, seeing speedy recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, with nearly all in the closely observed clinical trial, were discharged in a week. Gilead later said that anecdotal reports did not provide statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs, which sees a decline of 36% in Q2 iPhone units. Boeing (BA) is planning to resume commercial jet production in Seattle, Washington as early as Monday, providing some support to suppliers, such as Spirit AeroSystems (SPR). Ford Motor (F) looks for a net loss of around USD 2bln for Q1 2020, according to an SEC filing; expects an approximate USD 800mln tax expense in Q1. SPX +2.7% at 2875, NDX +0.8% at 8832, DJI +3% at 24242.</p><p>A choppy session for the Treasury curve; by settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 10s +3bps at 0.64% and 30s +5bps at 1.26bps. An initial Gilead-induced risk bounce, which sequentially faded, only for Treasuries to be offered after the release of the NY Fed’s new (reduced) scheduled of purchases for next week’s asset buys. After the 10-year yield found solace around the 0.60% figure on Thursday, the risk rally in later trade saw it back up to just beneath 0.70%, with the Fed set to by USD 15bln per day next week, down from USD 30bln. The further tapering of the Fed’s purchases saw the curve bear steepen. However, the cuts will be evenly distributed across maturities, which some analysts suggesting that gives credence to the view that the increasingly Fed-lite market could be expressing its view of increased inflation expectations; one strategist at Janney Montgomery noted that in the wake of the Fed’s QE1 and ZIRP announcement in 2008/09, there was a +75bps back up in long-end yields in the face of a deflationary environment, which saw 2s10s widen to around the 100bps area (2s10s currently sits just below 45bps). T-note futures (M20) settled 11 ticks lower at 138-28+.</p>",
