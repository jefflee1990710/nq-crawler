Event: FOMC Minutes, Riksbank Financial Stability Report. Speakers: BoE Governor Bailey. Supply: France, UK, German &amp; US. Earnings: Target &amp; Analog Devices.</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>After a choppy start amid further negative US/China headlines, stocks had managed to add to gains, with consumer discretionary and communications leading (energy and financials lagged); momentum and growth baskets were performing well, while dividend, min vol and size strategies were lower. However, it got a little hairy in afternoon trade, on negative news flow about Moderna’s COVID vaccine, which saw bourses move significantly into the red. Prior to the slide, the Dow was lagging the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 after downside in energy names, as well as WMT and HD trading lower after earnings. The dollar is a touch lower, which has allowed pretty much everything else to rise against it; notably commodity FX was putting in a strong show, despite crude settling mixed (and on little news flow); risk-sensitive FX also had a decent session. Treasury yields are lower, but major curve spreads are mixed (2s5s and 2s10s slightly narrower, while 2s30s,, 5s10s, 5s30s and 10s30s all a touch wider); some desks had suggested that the steepening, particularly in 5s30s was a function of concession ahead of the return of 20-year Treasury supply on Wednesday. Fed’s Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin didn’t have any major updates in their testimony to Senate lawmakers.</p><h2>VACCINE</h2><p><strong>MODERNA</strong> (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine reportedly did not produce data critical to assessing the vaccine, according to a STAT News report citing experts. The piece didn’t provide new details necessarily of the Phase 1 results presented yesterday, which had been supporting risk assets, but it instead phrased the results in a more cautious tone, noting the problems with the eight-person sample size used in the study. Elsewhere, a study completed by UnitedHealth (UNH) with Yale Medicine School has found that elderly COVID-19 patients taking hypertension medication are at lower risk of hospitalisation and a clinical trial is to follow immediately.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>TRADE:</strong> US President Trump said the US should consider terminating trade deals under which it imports cattle. The remarks were made in reference to a new USD 19bln farmer aid programme, which is likely a campaign effort for farmers ahead of the elections. Trump also said he is talking to Canada about relaxing the ban on non-essential trade. The US Chamber of Commerce also said today that protecting the resiliency of US supply chains does not mean having to reshore all production to the US – note, AAPL announced it was shifting earphone production to Vietnam.</p><p><strong>WHO/CHINA: </strong>Chinese Foreign Ministry, regarding US President Trump’s letter to WHO, said the US’ letter attempts to mislead public, to smear China and tries to shift the blame of its own “incompetent” response. This came after US President Trump criticised the World Health Organization in which he stated it has done a sad job and is a puppet of China, while he is to make a decision soon and was considering reducing the US contribution to the WHO to USD 40mln (currently around USD 400mln) but said some felt that was too much. Furthermore, he later shared the letter he sent to the WHO which warned if they do not commit to substantive improvements within next 30 days, the US will permanently freeze its funding and reconsider membership.</p><p><strong>CHINESE STOCK LISTINGS: </strong>China will push ahead with listings of domestic companies in London, as its seeks to move away from US amid an escalation in tensions, SCMP reported. “In a revival of the virtually suspended cross-border investment programme, Beijing will resume vetting applications by Chinese companies looking to sell global depository receipts (GDR) on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) through a link with the Shanghai bourse, according to a source familiar with the matter.” Earlier, sources had noted that Nasdaq is said to be tightening listing rules and restricting IPOs of Chinese companies. Nasdaq has not yet confirmed the reports, although it did announce the delisting of Luckin Coffee (LK) amid the accounting scandals at the Chinese Co.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>US President Trump said he had a good meeting with Republican senators and that progress was made on many issues.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile, US Senate Majority Leader McConnell said over the next couple of weeks he will assess the need for additional coronavirus aid legislation; additionally, GOP Leader McCarthy does not see the need right now for another relief bill, CNN reported.<strong> </strong>FBN’s Gasparino reported that<strong> </strong>there is a growing congressional consensus on another round of stimulus after Memorial Day, possibly as much as USD 1 trillion. Note, the House Democrats tabled a USD 3trln bill although the Senate is very unlikely to accept this as many Republicans have expressed opposition to it as many GOP’s want to see how the current stimulus plays out, and some believed the Democrats were attempting to use it as a way of funding their desired policies. Morgan Stanley’s analysts have a base case that the next tranche of stimulus will be sized at between USD 700bln to USD 1.1trln - short of the USD 3trln that the House Bill passed Friday is looking for; Morgan Stanley said that, in a bull case, they can see between USD 1.6trln to USD 2.4trln size. Meanwhile, NEC Director Kudlow said in an FBN interview that the White House looking a corporate tax cut; need to wait and see on payroll protection program changes to relax rules. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that a reduction in taxes for middle class households should be “seriously considered”.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>RECOVERY FUND:</strong> European Commission Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis said the recovery instrument proposal will surpass EUR 1tln, comprised of a mix of loans and grants; Commission is exploring the possibility of using some funds this year, it’s not straightforward. It was earlier reported in April noted that Spain is to propose EUR 1.5tln backed by perpetual bonds, other reports in said the EU recovery plan could trigger EUR 2tln of spending and investment. It was also earlier reported of a touted Recovery Fund launch date in 2021, some fear this could be hit less resilient economies, namely the likes of Italy, Spain, Greece. Meanwhile, French Finance Minister Le Maire said the EU recovery fund will not be available until 2021. Looking ahead, the official EU proposal is to be unveiled on May 27th, and European Council President Michel has to broker final accord, with a meeting yet to be scheduled.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>POWELL TESTIMONY: </strong>Nothing too new in Powell’s remarks infront of the Senate Banking Committee today. However, the Fed Chair did say that the Fed is continuing to look into ways to accommodate additional borrowers, and is particularly looking at extending borrowing to states with low populations. Powell said he expects the balance sheet to gradually shrink over time; what matters is the size of the balance sheet relative to the size of the US economy, and the balance sheet does not yet raise financial stability concerns.</p><p><strong>FED SPEAK: </strong>Kashkari (voter, dove) said that US GDP growth is probably one or two years away; US has extraordinary fiscal capacity to borrow/spend what is needed to get through the current crisis. Rosengren (non-voter, hawk) said policymakers will do whatever they can to support the return to full employment; the unemployment rate will likely remain at double digit levels by year-end.</p><p><strong>ECB: </strong>Lane said the ECB is fully prepared to further adjust instruments if needed, including increasing PEPP size and tweaking composition as much as needed. Lane said the APP and PEPP are expected to compress term premium by ~80bps at the 10yr tenor. Reiterated that in all scenarios, a deep recession is envisaged: in the severe scenario, real GDP would fall by 12% in 2020.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 8+ TICKS HIGHER AT 138-27+</strong></p><p>Treasury yields were lower across the curve, and major curve spreads were mixed on Tuesday; 2s unchanged at 17bp, 10s –3bp at 71bp, and 30s -2bp at 144bp. After the chunky UST sell off on Monday, real money was said to have lifting offers across the curve in the APAC session (yield thirsty Japanese funds have been noted as the marginal buyer in recent weeks as FX hedging costs declined). However, as US participants returned, hedge fund reallocation flows were said by one desk to have continued to exert pressure on USTs, creating somewhat of a tug-of-war with buyers in Asia. Some suggested that the long-end underperformance was a function of concession heading into Wednesday’s sale of new 20-year bonds.</p><p><strong>US 20-YEAR BOND AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>At its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it would finally issue its new 20-year maturities on 20th May, for a size of USD 20bln (cue ‘20-20-20’ “jokes”). The size was bigger than anticipated (USD 12-14bln was touted), and with heavier supply at the long-end of the curve, combined with no announcement of a 4- or 6-year tenor, resulted in sharp curve steepening in the wake of the announcement, though this has been pared somewhat as risk conditions soften in recent trade. UBS estimates that the market has cheapened the 20-year sector, noting that the sector was cheap versus 10s30s curve as well, although now seems fair; hence, UBS says, it is cheap outright. “In general, we think the sector has already been cheap due to less liquidity and the fact that the Fed owns a large portion of the issues in the 20-year sector so its future purchases are limited.” The bank argues that, given where the 3.375% May 2044 bond is trading, fair value for the 20-year issue is implied at around 1.27%; If we assume 1-2bps of liquidity premia for the new issue, the issue is likely to trade at 1.26%, the bank writes, speculating that the issue should see strong demand since a lot of indexers and Asset Liability Management hedgers will need to buy it. “You can pick-up a lot of yield as the steepest part of 10s30s curve (around 70bps) where fair value is actually 10s20s curve (60bps),” UBS says, noting that the 30-year bond has a duration of 23-years, and comparatively, the 20-year will have a duration of 17.6yrs (5.4yrs shorter), and therefore, it makes more sense to extend duration with a 20-year than a 30- year. “Clearly, if the roll opens cheap to our fair-value estimate, we recommend owning the WI vs comparator,” UBS writes, “post-auction on Wednesday May 20th, into month-end, we recommend putting on 10s20s curve flatteners,” adding that we are likely to see larger than normal index extension because of heavy long-end issuance this month.”</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 31.96; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 0.16 LOWER AT USD 34.65</strong></p><p>Crude prices traded subdued and choppy after the strong gains on Monday that resulted from a market-wide reflation trade. Part of the recent strength is likely a function of short-covering ahead of June contract expiry, Citi notes, as several speculators likely grew short positions in the wake of last month’s WTI expiry, in hope of another move towards the negative prices seen back then. Citi says that participants are taking bullish enthusiasm from the front-month spread backwardation in WTI as signal of growing tightness in the physical market, as well as looking past near term demand weakness as a temporary factor, as evidenced by weak data points being shrugged off. News flow in the energy space was light today, although US Energy Secretary Brouillette said, in an Axios Q&amp;A talking about US energy companies, that if these companies borrowed too much,&nbsp; or borrowed at a ‘bad’ rate, those decisions are going to have consequences, and the government should not step in to change the ultimate outcome. Brouillette also said that he thinks as demand comes back, we will see increasing production return in the US once again. Looking ahead, bulls will be looking for further signs of physical market tightness in this week’s US inventories. Current expectations (bbls): crude +1.2mln, Cushing -5.1mln, distillate +1.4mln, gasoline -2.1mln.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.07% at 2922, NDQ -0.36% at 9299, DJIA -1.59% at 24,207</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy -2.89%, Financials -2.52%, Real Estate -1.85%, Cons Stpl -1.75%, Utilities -1.7%, Industrials -1.28%, Health -1.21%, Materials -1%, Communication Svs -0.41%, Technology -0.4%, Cons Disc -0.09%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Walmart opened higher after beating on both the top- and bottom-lines, saying that unprecedented demand for products across multiple categories led to strong top-line results, and US comp sales were above estimates, and accelerated in mid-April owing to government stimulus cheques. It said net sales and operating results were significantly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, and it has withdrawn FY guidance. Certain incremental costs negatively affected operating income, including costs associated with enhanced wages and benefits as well as safety and sanitation. Company will discontinue Jet.com. Home Depot (HD) open in the red (6.8% Dow weight, 1.1% SPX weight), after it missed on EPS, beat on revenue; comparable sales were above consensus; dividend was maintained; HD said that while sales trends were strong at the end of Q1 and into the first two weeks of Q2, it was suspending Fy20 guidance due to COVID uncertainty. HD took actions to support staff in light of COVID and incurred a total of approximately USD 850mln of pre-tax expenses, equaling around 0.60 per diluted share. Baidu (BIDU) saw top and bottom-line beats and solid guidance. Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) missed on EPS and revenue, although it noted that its comp sales improved week by week in May.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Facebook (FB) launched a new product, Facebook Shops which initially weighed on Shopify (SHOP) however the new product is actually powered by SHOP and thus a reversal was seen, and SHOP gained. Spotify (SPOT) announced a multi-year licensing deal for the Joe Rogan Podcast. Nasdaq is to release new restrictions on IPO’s in a move that makes it harder to Chinese companies to debut on its stock exchange, according to sources. Reports in WWD suggest Amazon (AMZN) is eyeing JCPenney (JCP) and the two are apparently in talks over a deal. However, trading is to be suspended on NYSE. United Airlines (UAL) notes as of May it has seen a reduction in customer cancellations, while Southwest (LUV) announced it has experienced a modest improvement in June bookings and April capacity was -58% and Delta (DAL) are running more flights to prevent overcrowded planes. SoftBank (9984 JT) is to sell a sizeable stake in T-Mobile (TMUS) in a secondary offering, according to sources. Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal is being sued by SmileDirectClub (SDC). Morderna (MRNA) is said to be offering around USD 187.5mln of common shares at a price range of USD 75-77.50/shr to fund capital needs for its MRNA-1273 COVID vaccine; note that a Stat News report citing health experts highlighted that the positive news on a vaccine from Monday warrants caution due to the low sample size of the study.</p><h2>FX WRAP</h2><p><strong>DXY slides while risk sensitive currencies outperform</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The dollar continued its decline, despite subdued risk appetite in pre-market trade on the back of US/WHO/China headline risk, but as the US session progressed the buck rose off its lows. Technicians are eyeing the May low of 99.239 on the DXY, which seems to have held in today’s session with DXY finding support within a whisker above the level. Capital Economics believes that although uncertainty on the economic recovery should continue to support the dollar, the risk asset recovery and fall in US interest rates will start to pull the currency down in the weeks ahead.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency continues to benefit from the Franco-German EU recovery fund proposal, while dollar weakness was also supportive. Analysts are cognizant of the proposal given that they still needs to be backed by al 27 member states, and some nations like Austria have already pushed back on the idea, while those like Netherlands have previously objected the grants (vs loans) and “coronabonds”. Analysts at Citi note that the announcement reinforces its expectation that pro-EU forces will avoid a major escalation in break up risks and that it is in fitting with their view that near term risks are skewed to a positive surprise on the plan. The bank however remains bearish on the currency as there are significant uncertainties and expect some pushback to the idea; Citi look to fade the EUR rally.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling continued to rise today given the risk appetite of the currency with other cyclicals also performing well amid a falling dollar however risks remain with Brexit talks yielding little to no progress with the June extension deadline approaching. Elsewhere, there is a wide consensus the BoE are to expand its QE programme by USD 200bln at its June meeting. JPMorgan notes they are selling GBP on this bounce against both the USD and EUR, as UK issues have not gone away while there is positive news elsewhere, although the desk caveats with more risk-on could see cable push higher, but overall it is selling into the recent strength.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The yen continues to see downside against the dollar as risk improves, albeit not to the same extend as yesterday given some concerns overnight with the US, WHO, and China. Losses are only modest, however, and ING points out the “heavily reduced USD advantage” and expect to see USDJPY at 105 this summer.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> Risk sensitive currencies continue to perform well with particular outperformance in NZD; commentary from RBNZ deputy Governor Bascand noted that no decision had been made on negative rates (after the RBNZ left the door open for them in its latest meeting) while Assistant Governor Hawkesby suggested there is no need to adjust stimulus in wake of the budget but is open to all tools, adding there may not be the need to increase the size of its QE programme (recently increased the size to NZD 60bln).</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The Aussie also performed well on risk, but not to the same extent as its Antipodean counterpart. The latest RBA minutes saw members assess the best course of action was to maintain current policy while it highlighted what is required before policy is adjusted “It would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it is confident inflation will be sustainably within the 2-3% target band”, and 3-year yields would be maintained until progress was made towards its full employment and inflation target. Westpac believes the “progress towards” can mean if the bank is confident that any move towards full employment will be sustained, it can remove the target for the three-year yield. And WPAC also believes that the 3-year target rate will be lifted to around 0.4% during 2022, although the overnight cash rate will not be lifted before the end of 2023 and dismiss the possibility of negative rates.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> The majority of EMFX traded in line with risk appetite, apart from the BRL which was weaker on the day with Brazil becoming one of the most infected nations as it now has more COVID cases than the UK while lingering worries over the political state continue to add concern. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs cut its Brazil 2020 GDP growth forecast to -7.4% from -3.4%. Petro currencies (MXN, RUB) were also firmer although MXN led the way. TRY, however, outperformed, with USDTRY seeing lows of 6.75 despite Treasury Officials announcing they are still in discussions for swap lines and that talks of a deal with the BoE and BoJ were not true, dismissing earlier reports.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Treasury yields were lower across the curve, and major curve spreads were mixed on Tuesday; 2s unchanged at 17bp, 10s –3bp at 71bp, and 30s -2bp at 144bp. After the chunky UST sell off on Monday, real money was said to have lifting offers across the curve in the APAC session (yield thirsty Japanese funds have been noted as the marginal buyer in recent weeks as FX hedging costs declined). However, as US participants returned, hedge fund reallocation flows were said by one desk to have continued to exert pressure on USTs, creating somewhat of a tug-of-war with buyers in Asia. Some suggested that the long-end underperformance was a function of concession heading into Wednesday’s sale of new 20-year bonds.</p><p><strong>US 20-YEAR BOND AUCTION PREVIEW</strong>: At its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it would finally issue its new 20-year maturities on 20th May, for a size of USD 20bln (cue ‘20-20-20’ “jokes”). The size was bigger than anticipated (USD 12-14bln was touted), and with heavier supply at the long-end of the curve, combined with no announcement of a 4- or 6-year tenor, resulted in sharp curve steepening in the wake of the announcement, though this has been pared somewhat as risk conditions soften in recent trade. UBS estimates that the market has cheapened the 20-year sector, noting that the sector was cheap versus 10s30s curve as well, although now seems fair; hence, UBS says, it is cheap outright. “In general, we think the sector has already been cheap due to less liquidity and the fact that the Fed owns a large portion of the issues in the 20-year sector so its future purchases are limited.” The bank argues that, given where the 3.375% May 2044 bond is trading, fair value for the 20-year issue is implied at around 1.27%; If we assume 1-2bps of liquidity premia for the new issue, the issue is likely to trade at 1.26%, the bank writes, speculating that the issue should see strong demand since a lot of indexers and Asset Liability Management hedgers will need to buy it. “You can pick-up a lot of yield as the steepest part of 10s30s curve (around 70bps) where fair value is actually 10s20s curve (60bps),” UBS says, noting that the 30-year bond has a duration of 23-years, and comparatively, the 20-year will have a duration of 17.6yrs (5.4yrs shorter), and therefore, it makes more sense to extend duration with a 20-year than a 30- year. “Clearly, if the roll opens cheap to our fair-value estimate, we recommend owning the WI vs comparator,” UBS writes, “post-auction on Wednesday May 20th, into month-end, we recommend putting on 10s20s curve flatteners,” adding that we are likely to see larger than normal index extension because of heavy long-end issuance this month.”</p>",

Part of the recent strength is likely a function of short-covering ahead of June contract expiry, Citi notes, as several speculators likely grew short positions in the wake of last month’s WTI expiry, in hope of another move towards the negative prices seen back then. Citi says that participants are taking bullish enthusiasm from the front-month spread backwardation in WTI as signal of growing tightness in the physical market, as well as looking past near term demand weakness as a temporary factor, as evidenced by weak data points being shrugged off. News flow in the energy space was light today, although US Energy Secretary Brouillette said, in an Axios Q&amp;A talking about US energy companies, that if these companies borrowed too much, &nbsp;or borrowed at a ‘bad’ rate, those decisions are going to have consequences, and the government should not step in to change the ultimate outcome. Brouillette also said that he thinks as demand comes back, we will see increasing production return in the US once again. Looking ahead, bulls will be looking for further signs of physical market tightness in this week’s US inventories.

Capital Economics believes that although uncertainty on the economic recovery should continue to support the dollar, the risk asset recovery and fall in US interest rates will start to pull the currency down in the weeks ahead.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The single currency continues to benefit from the Franco-German EU recovery fund proposal, while dollar weakness was also supportive. Analysts are cognizant of the proposal given that they still needs to be backed by al 27 member states, and some nations like Austria have already pushed back on the idea, while those like Netherlands have previously objected the grants (vs loans) and “coronabonds”. Analysts at Citi note that the announcement reinforces its expectation that pro-EU forces will avoid a major escalation in break up risks and that it is in fitting with their view that near term risks are skewed to a positive surprise on the plan. The bank however remains bearish on the currency as there are significant uncertainties and expect some pushback to the idea; Citi look to fade the EUR rally.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling continued to rise today given the risk appetite of the currency with other cyclicals also performing well amid a falling dollar however risks remain with Brexit talks yielding little to no progress with the June extension deadline approaching. Elsewhere, there is a wide consensus the BoE are to expand its QE programme by USD 200bln at its June meeting. JPMorgan notes they are selling GBP on this bounce against both the USD and EUR, as UK issues have not gone away while there is positive news elsewhere, although the desk caveats with more risk-on could see cable push higher, but overall it is selling into the recent strength.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The yen continues to see downside against the dollar as risk improves, albeit not to the same extend as yesterday given some concerns overnight with the US, WHO, and China. Losses are only modest, however, and ING points out the “heavily reduced USD advantage” and expect to see USDJPY at 105 this summer.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> &nbsp;Risk sensitive currencies continue to perform well with particular outperformance in NZD; commentary from RBNZ deputy Governor Bascand noted that no decision had been made on negative rates (after the RBNZ left the door open for them in its latest meeting) while Assistant Governor Hawkesby suggested there is no need to adjust stimulus in wake of the budget but is open to all tools, adding there may not be the need to increase the size of its QE programme (recently increased the size to NZD 60bln).</p><p><strong>AUD: </strong>The Aussie also performed well on risk, but not to the same extent as its Antipodean counterpart. The latest RBA minutes saw members assess the best course of action was to maintain current policy while it highlighted what is required before policy is adjusted “It would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it is confident inflation will be sustainably within the 2-3% target band”, and 3-year yields would be maintained until progress was made towards its full employment and inflation target. Westpac believes the “progress towards” can mean if the bank is confident that any move towards full employment will be sustained, it can remove the target for the three-year yield. And WPAC also believes that the 3-year target rate will be lifted to around 0.4% during 2022, although the overnight cash rate will not be lifted before the end of 2023 and dismiss the possibility of negative rates.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>The majority of EMFX traded in line with risk appetite, apart from the BRL which was weaker on the day with Brazil becoming one of the most infected nations as it now has more COVID cases than the UK while lingering worries over the political state continue to add concern. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs cut its Brazil 2020 GDP growth forecast to -7.4% from -3.4%. Petro currencies (MXN, RUB) were also firmer although MXN led the way. TRY, however, outperformed, with USDTRY seeing lows of 6.75 despite Treasury Officials announcing they are still in discussions for swap lines and that talks of a deal with the BoE and BoJ were not true, dismissing earlier reports.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Yen is underperforming across the board amidst another rebound in US Treasury alongside other core global bond yields from recent lows, and with curves still braced or making room for heavy issuancef. Usd/Jpy surpassed prior mtd peaks around 107.77 on the way through 108.00 to test mid-April highs at 108.08 before paring back on a broad downturn in risk sentiment, but a close above the big figure could see technical momentum build further towards the 200 DMA (108.27) ahead of Friday’s BoJ meeting on bank lending measures already signalled by Governor Kuroda last month. Conversely, the Kiwi has inched beyond 0.6100 vs its US counterpart on a combination less dovish sounding commentary from the RBNZ (Deputy Governor Bascand advocating a wait-and-see stance overnight) and an element of ‘safe-haven’ positioning via the Aud/Nzd cross in view of heightened trade tensions between Australia and China over the former’s push for a full COVID-19 probe. As a result, the Aussie reversed gains above 1.0800 to sub-1.0750 relative to its Antipodean peer and Aud/Usd pulled up short of multi-tops circa 0.6570 yet again.</p><p><strong>GBP/NOK/CAD/MXN/RUB</strong></p><p>Sterling derived some early support and traction from a rather timely announcement of a new favoured nation tariff scheme to replace the EU’s Common External Tariff regime after the Brexit transition that will remove Gbp 30 bn taxes on imports from the start of next year. The headlines hit in tandem with a bigger than anticipated jump in the UK claimant count and marginally weaker than consensus earnings to the benefit of the Pound, as Cable sustained its recovery from sub-1.2200 lows and Eur/Gbp backed off within a 0.8958-16 range. Meanwhile, strength in the Norwegian Crown, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Russian Rouble emanated mainly from oil maintaining its buoyancy into the June WTI crude contract expiry in stark contrast to the collapse in May and unprecedented/uncharted plunge below parity when the May future rolled off. Indeed, the Nok resisted persistent Eur strength and comments from Norges Bank Governor Olsen highlighting room to manoeuvre on the economic policy side of the equation even if the depo rate has hit a floor, while the Rub took dovish CBR commentary and softer than forecast Q1 GDP in stride.</p><p><strong>EUR/DXY</strong></p><p>The Euro extended post-EU recovery fund and joint debt issuance gains to 1.0976 vs the Buck and 118.00+ against the Yen, but failed to reach 1.1100 and 118.50 respectively after French Finance Minister Le Maire dampened some euphoria by underlining that the extra Eur500 bn cash will not be available until 2021. However, the Greenback failed to take advantage due to the aforementioned vs most major rivals and the bulk of EM currencies, as the index pivoted 99.500 between 99.735-225 extremes with no independent impetus from Fed chair Powell or US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin given pre-releases of their testimonies yesterday.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira and Rand continue their renaissance regardless of disappointment for the Try in terms of CBRT efforts to try and secure swap lines still not proving successful, while the Zar got some encouragement from better than expected SA mining production data to offset a drop in manufacturing output in the run up to Thursday’s SARB policy meeting that is tipped to culminate in a 50 bp rate cut.</p>",

Further<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/chinese-foreign-ministry-regarding-us-president-trump-s-letter-to-who-says-us-letter-attempts-to-mislead-public-to-smear-china-and-tries-to-shift-blame-of-its-own-incompetent-response-19-05-2020\"> prickly US/China headlines</a> were partly responsible this morning, although the S&amp;P 500 Emini has been gradually easing after an overnight report that Nasdaq may unveil <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-nasdaq-china-listings-exclusive/exclusive-nasdaq-to-tighten-listing-rules-restricting-chinese-ipos-sources-idUKKBN22V01Q\">new restrictions on IPOs</a>, which will make it more difficult for some Chinese companies to list on the exchange. SPX and DJI open lower, NDX higher. The VIX has ticked up but remains sub-30. The Treasury curve is steeper slightly, though yields are lower across the curve (note: The Fed’s single operation in the short-end today is sized above the daily average). The Dollar Index is softer for the second day (just), towards the bottom of its May range (May low 99.239 for your reference); the buck’s weakness is allowing risk-sensitive FX and EMFX to rally. Commodity FX is also higher despite crude benchmarks being mixed. Gold trades slightly higher. The focus continues to remain on reopening economies, progress on vaccines and treatments, commentary from corporates that shows the process of recovering is underway, and of course stimulus measures (Powell and Mnuchin testify to Senate later today; BOJ to take more measures to support banks; Europe’s relief package proposals are a positive development on Monday, in that they will offer grants not loans, though will likely face some hurdles among national governments due to proposals of joint debt issuance).</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Sectors open mostly in the red with underperformance in Energy and Financials after solid gains yesterday (+7.6 and +5.3%, respectively). Note, crude prices and yields are both modestly lower today. Technology outperforms and is the only sector in the green, with heavy weights Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) both up slightly at the open.&nbsp; Tech gains sees NDX outperform, which is also boosted by gains in Baidu (BIDU) post earnings.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Walmart opened higher after beating on both the top- and bottom-lines, saying that unprecedented demand for products across multiple categories led to strong top-line results, and US comp sales were above estimates, and accelerated in mid-April owing to government stimulus cheques. It said net sales and operating results were significantly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, and it has withdrawn FY guidance. Certain incremental costs negatively affected operating income, including costs associated with enhanced wages and benefits as well as safety and sanitation. Company will discontinue Jet.com. Home Depot (HD) open in the red (6.8% Dow weight, 1.1% SPX weight), after it missed on EPS, beat on revenue; comparable sales were above consensus; dividend was maintained; HD said that while sales trends were strong at the end of Q1 and into the first two weeks of Q2, it was suspending Fy20 guidance due to COVID uncertainty. HD took actions to support staff in light of COVID and incurred a total of approximately USD 850mln of pre-tax expenses, equaling around 0.60 per diluted share. Baidu (BIDU) saw top and bottom-line beats and solid guidance. Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) missed on EPS and revenue, although it noted that its comp sales improved week by week in May.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Nasdaq is to release new restrictions on IPO’s in a move that makes it harder to Chinese companies to debut on its stock exchange, according to sources. Reports in WWD suggest Amazon (AMZN) is eyeing JCPenney (JCP) and the two are apparently in talks over a deal. However, trading is to be suspended on NYSE. United Airlines (UAL) notes as of May it has seen a reduction in customer cancelations, while Southwest (LUV) announced it has experienced a modest improvement in June bookings and April capacity was -58% and Delta (DAL) are running more flights to prevent overcrowded planes. SoftBank (9984 JT) is to sell a sizeable stake in T-Mobile (TMUS) in a secondary offering, according to sources. Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal is being sued by SmileDirectClub (SDC). Morderna (MRNA) is said to be offering around USD 187.5mln of common shares at a price range of USD 75-77.50/shr to fund capital needs for its MRNA-1273 COVID vaccine.</p><p><strong>ES KEY LEVELS: </strong>The S&amp;P 500 Emini took out the April high in overnight trade, rising to 2,976.25, bringing the 200dma just under 3,000 into focus; however, the air remains thin at those levels, and ES has fallen back to just above the key 2,930 region. To the topside, 2,950-2,955 is worth keeping an eye from a valuation perspective (consensus FY20 expected EPS 138 x 21.4 p/e; FY21 EPS expected 163 x 18.1 p/e). On the downside, desks are continuing to watch 2,930 (61.8% Feb hi-Mar lo) and the region around 2,900, and then Monday’s low around 2,850.</p><p><strong>SHORT-TERM TRADERS LIQUIDATING SHORTS:</strong> Nomura’s quant team thinks many speculative investors have had to reconsider the 'sell in May' play, or trades based on a stock market 'double-dip'. The bank suggests that short-term traders are liquidating short positions in US equities, and it believes that these investors think the 'sell in May' opportunity has passed. It also observes that fundamentally focused global macro hedge funds are being pressed into covering shorts in DM equities again; these funds have been trading on the assumption that DM equity markets are in for a double dip may be facing pressure, not only from the swing back to improvement in the economic surprise index, but also increasing news reports suggesting that a COVID-19 vaccine may become widely available sooner than previously expected, Nomura says. However, global macro hedge funds have kept their net exposure to DM equities steady at a fairly low level, and Nomura sees no sign of across-the-board buying push that one might expect if investors were feeling FOMO, and the bank does not expect there to be many of these investors inclined to sell the rally in DM equities, unless some unexpected market-negative news pops up. Meanwhile, the quants observe that CTAs appear to have already put a stop to their exits from long positions in NASDAQ 100 futures, which have been holding up well, though it believes that these CTAs may become net buyers again around 5th June, “but it is possible that they could start accumulating longs again even sooner than that,” Nomura says.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>WHAT’S GOING ON: </strong>Monday’s optimism seems to have cooled, and major European bourses gave up gains after the open. Further <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/chinese-foreign-ministry-regarding-us-president-trump-s-letter-to-who-says-us-letter-attempts-to-mislead-public-to-smear-china-and-tries-to-shift-blame-of-its-own-incompetent-response-19-05-2020\">prickly US/China headlines</a> were partly responsible this morning, although the S&amp;P 500 Emini has been gradually easing after an overnight report that Nasdaq may unveil <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-nasdaq-china-listings-exclusive/exclusive-nasdaq-to-tighten-listing-rules-restricting-chinese-ipos-sources-idUKKBN22V01Q\">new restrictions on IPOs</a>, which will make it more difficult for some Chinese companies to list on the exchange. The VIX has ticked up, but remains sub-30. The Treasury curve is bull-flattening moderately after Monday's bear steepener (note: the Fed’s single operation in the short-end today is sized above the daily average). The Dollar Index is softer for the second day, towards the bottom of its May range (May low 99.239 for your reference); the buck’s weakness is allowing risk-sensitive FX and EMFX to rally. Commodity FX is also higher despite crude benchmarks being mixed. Gold trades slightly higher. The focus continues to remain on reopening economies, progress on vaccines and treatments, commentary from corporates that shows the process of recovering is underway, and of course stimulus measures (Powell and Mnuchin testify to Senate later today; BOJ to take more measures to support banks; Europe’s relief package proposals are a positive development on Monday, in that they will offer grants not loans, though will likely face some hurdles among national governments due to proposals of joint debt issuance).</p><p><strong>ES KEY LEVELS: </strong>The S&amp;P 500 Emini took out the April high in overnight trade, rising to 2,976.25, bringing the 200dma just under 3,000 into focus; however, the air remains thin at those levels, and ES has fallen back to just above the key 2,930 region. To the topside, 2,950-2,955 is worth keeping an eye from a valuation perspective (consensus FY20 expected EPS 138 x 21.4 p/e; FY21 EPS expected 163 x 18.1 p/e). On the downside, desks are continuing to watch 2,930 (61.8% Feb hi-Mar lo) and the region around 2,900, and then Monday’s low around 2,850.</p><p><strong>WMT/HD EARNINGS: </strong>Home Depot (HD) lower in pre-market action (6.8% Dow weight, 1.1% SPX weight), missed on EPS, beat on revenue; comparable sales were above consensus; dividend was maintained; HD said that while sales trends were strong at the end of Q1 and into the first two weeks of Q2, it was suspending Fy20 guidance due to COVID uncertainty. HD took actions taken to support staff in light of COVID, and incurred a total of approximately USD 850mln of pre-tax expenses, equalling around 0.60 per diluted share. Walmart is higher in pre-market action, beating on both the top- and bottom-lines, saying that unprecedented demand for products across multiple categories led to strong top-line results, and US comp sales were above estimates, and accelerated in mid-April owing to government stimulus cheques. It said net sales and operating results were significantly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, and it has withdrawn FY guidance. Certain incremental costs negatively affected operating income, including costs associated with enhanced wages and benefits as well as safety and sanitation. Company will discontinue Jet.com.</p><p><strong>POWELL AT 10AM EDT: </strong>This week’s testimony by Chair Powell on Tuesday, the meeting minutes from the FOMC’s April confab on Wednesday, and the Fed Listens event to be attended by Powell on Thursday are not likely to reveal much by way of new information, given the proximity of the recent meeting and the subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Powell. Accordingly, the message from these events is likely to be a reiteration that the Fed will take action it deems necessary towards supporting the economy and aiding its bounce back from COVID, although that is not likely to include negative rates at this stage; the Fed is also likely to again call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-fed-chair-powell-and-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-will-deliver-quarterly-cares-act-report-to-congress-at-1000-et-1500-bst-19-05-2020\">Full preview here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BOJ:</strong> On the subject of central banks and stimulus, the BOJ said it would hold an off-schedule meeting on 22nd May to discuss further funding measures for the banking sector. In April, the BOJ said it would create a new scheme as soon as possible that rewards financial firms for lending to smaller companies hit by the pandemic. In April, Kuroda said the BOJ would finance loans that commercial banks extend to small businesses via the government programmes, and the central bank would also pay 0.1% interest to commercial banks that boost such lending.</p><p><strong>SHORT-TERM TRADERS LIQUIDATING SHORTS: </strong>Nomura’s quant team thinks many speculative investors have had to reconsider the 'sell in May' play, or trades based on a stock market 'double-dip'. The bank suggests that short-term traders are liquidating short positions in US equities, and it believes that these investors think the 'sell in May' opportunity has passed. It also observes that fundamentally focused global macro hedge funds are being pressed into covering shorts in DM equities again; these funds have been trading on the assumption that DM equity markets are in for a double dip may be facing pressure, not only from the swing back to improvement in the economic surprise index, but also increasing news reports suggesting that a COVID-19 vaccine may become widely available sooner than previously expected, Nomura says. However, global macro hedge funds have kept their net exposure to DM equities steady at a fairly low level, and Nomura sees no sign of across-the-board buying push that one might expect if investors were feeling FOMO, and the bank does not expect there to be many of these investors inclined to sell the rally in DM equities, unless some unexpected market-negative news pops up. Meanwhile, the quants observe that CTAs appear to have already put a stop to their exits from long positions in NASDAQ 100 futures, which have been holding up well, though it believes that these CTAs may become net buyers again around 5th June, “but it is possible that they could start accumulating longs again even sooner than that,” Nomura says.</p>",

As such, <strong>ASX 200 (+1.8%) </strong>shrugged off the increasing Aussie-Sino tensions from China’s import duties on Australian barley and briefly climbed above the 5600 level with upside led by the energy sector after the gains in oil prices and as its top-weighted financial sector also outperformed. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+1.5%)</strong> coat-tailed on the recent favourable currency moves which helped participants overlook the weak earnings from the likes of Panasonic, while SoftBank shares eventually slumped as plans to tap into its Alibaba and T-Mobile stakes to raise funds failed to offset selling pressure from a record FY loss. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.9%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%)</strong> conformed to the upbeat tone as China continued to tout more favourable policies including SOE reforms, interest rate liberalization, further opening up and lower tariffs, with the gains in Hong Kong exacerbated after rule changes in the Hang Seng Index which paves the way for the inclusion of Chinese internet giants such as Alibaba, Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping.

Meanwhile, despite Germany and France proposing a EUR 500bln European Recovery Fund, the unanimous approval itself could prove to be complex. Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden are not fond of the fund being distributed as grants, whilst the touted launch in 2021 may further strain peripheries hit harder by the pandemic such as Italy and Spain. On that note, FTSE MIB (-1.4%) and IBEX (-2.3%) are the marked underperformers thus far whilst core indices see broad-based losses between 0.1-0.4%. Trade updates aside, today marks the first session since the European short-selling ban was remove, as per yesterday’s announcements, potentially providing price action with some influence. Sectors are mostly in the red; breakdown also sees broad-based losses across most sectors, but financials fare better on initial optimism on the EU recovery fund. In terms of individual movers: Thyssenkrupp (+5.4%) holds onto opening gains after it said it is mulling the sale of their steel and warships divisions. Sources also noted that talks with Tata Steel never broke off and both the Cos is still in talks about consolidation. Handelsblatt reported that SSAB and Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel were interested in a majority of the steel unit.

Meanwhile, despite Germany and France proposing a EUR 500bln European Recovery Fund, the unanimous approval itself could prove to be complex. Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden are not fond of the fund being distributed as grants, whilst the touted launch in 2021 may further strain peripheries hit harder by the pandemic such as Italy and Spain. On that note, FTSE MIB (-1.4%) and IBEX (-2.3%) are the marked underperformers thus far whilst core indices see broad-based losses between 0.1-0.4%. Trade updates aside, today marks the first session since the European short-selling ban was remove, as per yesterday’s announcements, potentially providing price action with some influence. Sectors are mostly in the red; breakdown also sees broad-based losses across most sectors, but financials fare better on initial optimism on the EU recovery fund. In terms of individual movers: Thyssenkrupp (+5.4%) holds onto opening gains after it said it is mulling the sale of their steel and warships divisions. Sources also noted that talks with Tata Steel never broke off and both the Cos is still in talks about consolidation. Handelsblatt reported that SSAB and Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel were interested in a majority of the steel unit. Meanwhile, Wirecard (-1.6%) extended on losses amid source reports Germany’s accountancy watchdog FREP last year opened a probe into the Co. following allegations of accounting fraud. Carnival (-0.5%) is weighed on after being downgraded to Junk at Moody’s.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>NZD/GBP/AUD - The Kiwi has extended recovery gains in wake of commentary from RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand indicating no rush to deliver more monetary stimulus via an expansion of QE or adopting NIRP, as the Bank waits so see how data pans out before deciding whether it needs to adjust policy further. Nzd/Usd topped out just shy of 0.6100 and Aud/Nzd has retreated sharply through 1.0800 as Aud/Usd respects resistance at recent peaks around 0.6570 and the Aussie reflects on reports that China may add more exports to the higher tariff list on top of barley.

Nzd/Usd topped out just shy of 0.6100 and Aud/Nzd has retreated sharply through 1.0800 as Aud/Usd respects resistance at recent peaks around 0.6570 and the Aussie reflects on reports that China may add more exports to the higher tariff list on top of barley. Note, no added insight on the RBA front from minutes overnight that merely reiterated the grounds for maintaining rates and asset purchases at present levels while monitoring the impact or recent actions including the introduction of YCC. Meanwhile, the Pound has regained some poise across the board following latest negative interest rate chat from the BoE via Tenreyro and irrespective of UK data revealing a bigger than forecast jump in the claimant count alongside slightly softer than expected wages, with Cable back up above 1.2200 and briefly nibbling stops at 1.2266 and Eur/Gbp easing from 0.8950+ even though the Euro remains elevated independently on additional fiscal support to combat the adverse effects of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The single currency is consolidating towards the top of a circa 1.0956-03 range vs the Dollar and contributing to a depressed <strong>DXY </strong>around 99.500 in advance of US housing data, testimony from Fed chair Powell and comments from Rosengren. As noted above, another financial recovery fund for the Eurozone and agreement between Germany and France to issue joint EU debt as a means of paying for the Eur500 bn pot has given the Euro a boost amidst formative signs of an improvement in ZEW’s forward-looking economic sentiment indices.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>A previously unscheduled BoJ meeting to discuss bank funding measures preannounced in April and timetabled for this Friday prompted a bit more Yen weakness against the Greenback within 107.60-30 parameters, but the headline pair may be capped ahead of decent option expiry interest between 107.65-75 in 1.5 bn into the NY cut.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona has pared gains alongside crude prices and waning risk appetite, with perhaps some acknowledgment of remarks from Norges Bank Governor Olsen repeating that the depo rate has likely reached its lower bound, but there is more room in terms of economic policy.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Try has now breached 6.8000 to the downside and reports that the CBRT has arranged swap lines with the BoE and BoJ are helping the Lira continue its retracement, while the Idr has been very volatile following the BI’s unchanged rate decision that confounded consensus for a 25 bp cut.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>WATCH:</strong>&nbsp;You can watch Tuesday’s testimony to the Senate Banking Committee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/the-quarterly-cares-act-report-to-congress\">here</a>&nbsp;(on 19th May 2020 at 1500 BST/1000 EDT).Powell will deliver opening remarks at Thursday’s ‘Fed Listens’ event, which will be broadcast via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/fed-listens-how-is-covid-19-affecting-your-community.htm\">webcast</a>&nbsp;(21st May 2020 at 1930 BST/1430 EDT).</p><p><strong>SUMMARY:&nbsp;</strong>This week’s testimony by Chair Powell on Tuesday, the meeting minutes from the FOMC’s April confab on Wednesday, and the Fed Listens event to be attended by Powell on Thursday are not likely to reveal much by way of new information, given the proximity of the recent meeting and the subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Powell. Accordingly, the message from these events is likely to be a reiteration that the Fed will take action it deems necessary towards supporting the economy and aiding its bounce back from COVID, although that is not likely to include negative rates at this stage; the Fed is also likely to again call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>POWELL PRE-RELEASED TESTIMONY:</strong>&nbsp;Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will deliver their Quarterly CARES Act Report to Congress on Tuesday at 1000 ET/1500 BST, a transparency requirement. According to pre-released testimony late Monday, Fed chair Powell will repeat his pledge to maintain rates at near-zero levels until the economy has weathered the crisis, and emphasise that the passage of the CARES Act was critical to the Fed’s ability to expand credit programmes to help support the economy, and as a result of these actions, market function has improved.</p><p><strong>POWELL TO URGE FISCAL ACTION: </strong>Powell has previously said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed – a strong hint to fiscal policymakers as they debate the next tranche of stimulus. Powell on the weekend said at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. The Fed chair seems to be arguing that further support is crucial to any recovery, and that if policymakers are careful about how the economy is reopened, and people take these social distancing measures forward, then the recovery can begin fairly soon, and job losses seen since mid-March may prove to be temporary; he also argued that, assuming there is no second wave of the coronavirus, the economy will begin to recover steadily through the second half of this year.</p><p><strong>POWELL TO LEAN BACK ON NEGATIVE RATES:&nbsp;</strong>Fed chair Powell has pushed-back heavily against the idea of negative rates, citing the mixed evidence that exists on its efficacy. However, it is worth noting that a lot of Powell’s language has clearly been structured to leave the option open to the Fed in the future, and other Fed participants (like Kashkari) have also retained this optionality. Such an approach seems sensible, analysts argue; the Fed would be able to exhaust other policy options first before resorting to more aggressive policies. The message, therefore, seems to be that negative rates are not on the radar in the near-term, but the market and policymakers seem to be retaining a non-zero chance of seeing them next year.</p><p><strong>POWELL TO IGNORE DEFICIT FOR NOW: </strong>Powell on the weekend stressed that medical metrics are far more important than other economic data, and that for the economy to fully recover, Americans will have to be fully confident and that may have to await for the arrival of a vaccine. Powell will likely face questions from Republican lawmakers about how much support is feasible before there are concerns about public finances; Powell is likely to reiterate his argument that now is not the time to think about debt and deficit levels, although fiscal authorities will need to step up eventually.</p><p><strong>BANK DIVIDENDS: </strong>Elsewhere, analysts also say that Powell may be quizzed about whether US banks should continue paying dividends, after some global authorities recently restricted banks from doing so.</p><p><strong>FOMC APRIL MEETING RECAP:</strong>&nbsp;The Fed’s 30th April rate decision was as expected; the federal funds rate target and the interest on excess reserves were left unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and 0.10% respectively. The Fed reiterated its commitment to keep rates at current low levels until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its inflation and labour market goals. One key omission from its statement was references to specific amounts of asset purchases (previously it indicated that it would buy “at least” USD 500bln of Treasuries and at least USD 200bln of MBS); instead, it said it would purchase in amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which might be taken as a pledge for limitless QE until the central bank is confident that its mandates can be met – in his press conference, Chair Powell said the Fed was waiting to see how economic conditions unfold before committing. Some traders were disappointed by the lack of explicit forward guidance within the statement; Powell reiterated that rates would remain low until the economy has ‘weathered’ the COVID impact, echoing the statement. He provided what has become customary warnings about the impending collapse of economic metrics in Q2, as a result of the virus, but thinks that Q3 might see ‘substantial growth’. The Fed chair also emphasised a willingness to do more if required. And in terms of the outlook, Powell identified medium-term risks: the virus and bringing it under control; the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy; the global dimension, where negative data abroad can weigh on the US; Powell believes that the Fed has the policies to address these, but not perfectly. Another key omission was clues about yield curve control; analysts believe that the Fed will need to eventually implement a Japan/Australia style yield curve control policy that keeps a lid on shorter-dated Treasury yields – this policy would be the strong arm to bolster the central bank’s guidance that rates will be kept low. This policy is expected to be hinted at in the months ahead, likely from June, as the Fed gains more clarity on how the virus will play out. Additionally, desks believe that the Fed will continue to taper its (what has been front-loaded) asset purchases (currently running at an average clip of around USD 50bln/week) to something like USD 60-80bln per month (NOTE: this publication is released before the NY Fed update on Friday afternoon, where it may again lower the pace of purchases). However, don’t expect any updates until the aforementioned clarity can be seen; for what it is worth, Powell emphasised that the Fed would not be removing the punch bowl too quickly, or any time soon. One theme that has been in vogue in recent days is negative rates, after some Federal Funds Futures contracts rose above par, signalling a non-zero probability of negative rates ahead; Powell and Co. have heavily leaned-back against this policy tool next week; analysts are of the view that the tool would only be used if the Fed had exhausted all other options.</p>",

Hang Seng (+2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) conformed to the upbeat tone as China continued to tout more favourable policies including SOE reforms, interest rate liberalization, further opening up and lower tariffs, with the gains in Hong Kong exacerbated after rule changes in the Hang Seng Index which paves the way for the inclusion of Chinese internet giants such as Alibaba, Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping.&nbsp;</p><p>Nasdaq is said to be tightening listing rules and restricting IPOs of Chinese companies according to sources.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Germany and France have for the first-time proposed joint EU debt issuance, a pivotal moment in the bloc’s history. The nations have proposed a EUR 500bln recovery fund to give grants–not loans–to member states</strong>. Merkel said the combined aid package now has a volume of EUR 3trln. The bonds would be paid back via the EU national budget, German Chancellor Merkel said, and repayment would be over a long-time frame (Germany’s share would be 27%, as in the EU budget). National Parliaments will also have to give the green light; there is the possibility of an EU Treaty change in the long-term, but this proposal is focussed on the short-term. French President Macron said the proposals had been made in conjunction with consulting the likes of Italy and Netherlands (the latter has reportedly been against the idea, while the former is set to be a key beneficiary).</p><p>ECB President Lagarde welcomed the Franco-German \"ambitious and targeted\" proposal for an EU recovery fund, while she added there is no risk to the euro and that the currency is irreversible. There were also comments from German Chancellor Merkel who stated the repayment of the EUR 500bln will be over a long time period and Germany's share will be as it is in the regular EU budget at 27%.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> was lacklustre below the 100.00 level after having suffered from the heightened risk appetite and recent strength across its major counterparts. There were also comments from Fed Chair Powell who reiterated the pledge to maintain near-zero rates until the economy has weathered the crisis and that the Fed will use its full range of tools to support the economy, which precedes his upcoming testimony at the Senate Banking Committee later and the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday. The greenback’s major counterparts held on to most their gains with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> above 1.0900 after it was boosted following the proposal by Germany and France for a EUR 500bln recovery fund to provide grants to member states hit worst by the coronavirus outbreak, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> attempts to hold on to the 1.2200 handle after benefitting from the USD-woes. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses remain underpinned due to the risk appetite which coupled with the strength in commodities, also lifted antipodean currencies although some of the gains in <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> were later pared after the RBA Minutes which noted that members assessed the best course of action was to maintain policy settings but were prepared to boost government bond purchases again if necessary to achieve the yield target.</p><p>RBA Minutes stated that members assessed the best course of action was to maintain current policy setting and monitor economic and financials outcomes closely as support package had been introduced only recently, while it noted that the board determined it would not raise cash rate until progress is made towards full employment and inflation targets. Furthermore, the RBA agreed that policy package was working broadly as expected but is prepared to scale up government bond purchases again if necessary, to achieve the yield target. (Newswires)</p><p>RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand said RBNZ could extend and expand asset purchase programme further but added they will see how data plays out and provide more stimulus if required. Bascand added no decision has been made to buy foreign assets or launch negative rates which are among the many options available to the committee, while he reiterated they asked banks to be ready to transact negative rates in wholesale markets by year-end. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mostly higher overnight in which oil prices extended on the prior day’s strength, while there also reports that China’s oil demand has nearly returned to pre-COVID levels and data began to show slight increases in US air travel. Nonetheless, WTI crude futures are off best levels heading into the European open following a pullback below USD 33/bbl for the June contract which expires today. <strong>Copper</strong> prices notched mild gains amid the heightened global risk appetite and <strong>gold</strong> was rangebound overnight.</p><p>EIA said total shale regions oil production for June expected to be down by 197k BPD to 7.822mln BPD.

(Newswires)</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>A rocket attack hit near the US Embassy in Baghdad's Green Zone although no casualties were reported according to security sources. (AFP/Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday amid a risk-on tone that swept across major assets to kickstart the week; yields rose from 3bps at the front-end to 13bps in the long bond. The downside in USTs and EGBs began in European trade as value/cyclical/’real-economy’ stocks found their footing, particularly after constructive Fed Chair Powell comments from the weekend, and the news on a successful Phase 1 study of Moderna’s COVID vaccination – the pedigree duration-sensitive stocks were underperformers. The back-up in yields sustained into the US session, with bullish flows sparse amid the surprise Franco-German announcement of proposals for joint Euro issuance (coronabonds), emboldening risk appetite further, as well as raising the probability of further supply for the sovereign markets – Wednesday’s USD 20bln 20-year auction draws nearer, too. Supply indigestion was also made worse after Pfizer served the IG market with a four tranche USD 4bln deal, as well as continued offerings from other corporates on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, the Fed has tapered its weekly asset purchases by another USD 1bln per day; analysts question how much further the Fed can realistically taper given the record debt issuance and strained primary dealer balance sheets – the recent easing of the supplementary leverage ratio will have provided a much needed cash buffer for such. US T-note futures (M0) settle 23+ ticks lower at 138-19.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell reiterated pledge to maintain near-zero rates until the economy has weathered the crisis and Fed will use full range of tools to support the economy, while he noted that the passage of CARES act in March is critical to Fed's ability to expand credit programmes to help the economy. (Newswires)</p><p>NY Fed intends to conduct a small value contingency securities lending operation for the purpose of testing its contingency operation infrastructure. Reports added that the small value contingency operation will be conducted in addition to the regularly scheduled securities lending operation which will occur this Thursday.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board as the region takes impetus from the global stock rally spurred by several bullish factors including the reopening of economies, coronavirus treatment hopes and stimulus efforts after Germany and France proposed a EUR 500bln recovery fund. As such, ASX 200 (+2.1%) shrugged off the increasing Aussie-Sino tensions from China’s import duties on Australian barley and briefly climbed above the 5600 level with upside led by the energy sector after the gains in oil prices and as its top-weighted financial sector also outperforms. Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) coat-tails on the recent favourable currency moves which has helped participants overlook the weaker earnings from the likes of Panasonic, while SoftBank shares eventually slumped as plans to tap into its Alibaba and T-Mobile stakes to raise funds failed to offset selling pressure from a record FY loss. Hang Seng (+2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) conform to the upbeat tone as China continues to tout more favourable policies including SOE reforms, interest rate liberalization, further opening up and lower tariffs, with the gains in Hong Kong exacerbated after rule changes in the Hang Seng Index which paves the way for the inclusion of Chinese internet giants such as Alibaba, Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre below the 100.00 level after having suffered from the heightened risk appetite and recent strength across its major counterparts. There were also comments from Fed Chair Powell who reiterated the pledge to maintain near-zero rates until the economy has weathered the crisis and that the Fed will use its full range of tools to support the economy, which precedes his upcoming testimony at the Senate Banking Committee later and the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday. The greenback’s major counterparts hold on to their gains with EUR/USD above 1.0900 after it was boosted following the proposal by Germany and France for a EUR 500bln recovery fund to provide grants to member states hit worst by the coronavirus outbreak, while GBP/USD just about holds on to the 1.2200 handle as it benefits from the USD-woes. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses remain underpinned due to the risk appetite which coupled with the strength in commodities, has also lifted antipodean currencies although some of the gains in AUD/USD were later pared after the RBA Minutes which noted that members assessed the best course of action was to maintain policy settings but are prepared to boost government bond purchases again if necessary to achieve the yield target.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid spillover selling in T-notes as the demand for safe havens was sapped by the heightened global risk appetite, while the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 770bln also did little to inspire a turnaround in JGBs.</p>",
