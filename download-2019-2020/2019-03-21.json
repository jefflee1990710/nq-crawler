Furthermore, Politco's Morning Money suggested a China deal remains very close and the Beijing trip next week is largely ceremonial in order for China to feel they are being respected by an equal amount of visits, while a deal signing is still planned to happen in Mar-a-Lago at the end of April. (Newswires/CNBC/Politico)</p><p>Chinese public will not accept the government reaching a deal where the US keeps the tariffs in Chinese goods and China cancels tariffs, if this is the deal US wants investors should sell their stocks soon according to Global Times Editor. (Global Times)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p>UK PM May said she is confident she can still get a Brexit deal passed. However, there were also reports that a cabinet source is sceptical that her deal will pass and sees UK PM May's choice at the end of next week could be between no-deal or a long extension, while the source thinks PM May will choose no-deal according to Sky News Political Editor Rigby. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>The EU earlier reiterated it will allow an extension until May 22nd and not beyond provided the WA is approved by UK parliament next week. However, there were other reports that suggested EU leaders were discussing a Brexit extension to May 7th whether May's deal passes or not, while EU was said to mull a 9-month Brexit delay if UK PM May's deal is defeated. Separately, diplomatic sources stated that EU leaders could agree a 2-tier approach in which extension will be until May 22nd if PM May’s deal is approved but if not, the UK will have until April 12th to tell EU if it would hold European Parliament elections. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>BoE MPC voted 9-0 in favour of maintaining rates at 0.75% as expected, while it also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases at GBP 435bln and to maintain the stock of corporate bonds at GBP 10bln. BoE stated that economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and the timing of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and that monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. Furthermore, the BoE said an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% inflation target if the economy develops broadly in line with the projections made in the Feb QIR.&nbsp; BoE added that Bank staff now expect GDP to grow by 0.3% in Q1 2019 which is marginally stronger than seen in the Feb QIR and that CPI rose marginally in February to 1.9% with inflation expected to remain close to the 2% target over the coming months.

(Newswires)</p><p>MARKET RECAP</p><p>Apple (AAPL) helped support indices on Thursday after an upgrade at Needham, as well as a price target rise at Citi. Biogen (BIIB) opened with losses of over 25% on the back of it pulling out of an Alzheimer’s trial. Micron (MU) opened higher after beating top- and bottom-line estimates. Conagra (CAG) and Darden Restaurants (DRI) surged on strong earnings reports. Nordstrom (JWN) suffered from a downgrade at Gordon Haskett. International Flavours (IFF) opened on a tailwind from an upgrade at Goldman. Caesars (CZR) traded higher on reports Golden Nugget Casino owner Tilman Fertitta is to make a second bid for the co. Tesla (TSLA) opened in the red as it was reported it had not raised auto prices by the full 3% it had previously pledged, however pared back in later trade after drone footage showed its Shanghai Gigafactory production had made progress. SPX +1.09% at 2855, NDX +1.52% at 7493, DJI +0.84% at 25963.</p><p>At settlement, changes in Treasuries yields were modest. Some desks noted that after the aggressive post-Fed buying on Wednesday, more measured trading was to be expected, and the buying was most likely short-covering, and with fewer shorts, the buyside action was naturally more subdued. It is interesting that the effective Fed Funds Rate rose 1bps today to 2.41%, vs 2.40% over the last few weeks, with 2s yields trading below that level for a lot of the session, while the Fed Funds Rate eclipsed the IOER for the first time since the rate was launched in 2008. There was also a lot of attention on the 3-month/10-year spread, which was compressed to just 3.9bps at one point on Thursday (folks look at this spread as a more accurate gauge of recession risks, rather than 2s10s). Mortgage rates also dropped, helping some of the homebuilding names. The Treasury's sale of USD 11bln of 10-year TIPS was soft, tailing 1.1bps; the internals provided some encouragement, with the indirect participation jumping to 77% from 69%, pushing direct buyers participation lower. Going forward, some expect that, given G10 central banks aren't likely to all follow the Norges Bank higher, Treasuries could still be attractive to yield-hunters. Next week, the Treasury will auction USD 113bln in 2s/5s/7s, sizes unchanged vs the priors. US T-note futures (M9) settled 1+ ticks lower at 123-11+</p>",

The same report said that the US officials seeking a deal are focused on making long-term changes to the nation's economy. In regard to US officials visiting China next week, Politico reported that this is largely ceremonial, a political move to make sure China feels the US makes an equal number of trips. Politico also gave some contrasting reports, saying that a signing deal is still planned to happen in Mar-a-Lago at the end of April, where previous guidance had suggested June; the report furthered optimism by saying a deal remains very close.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>As was to be expected, this week’s BoE policy announcement provided little in the way of fireworks as Brexit continues to tie the hands of policymakers. The decision to stand pat on rates at 0.75% came via a 9-0 vote with the MPC maintaining their guidance that “were the economy to develop broadly in line with the projections made in the Feb QIR, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% inflation target”. On the Brexit front, policymakers continued to highlight that “the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction”. Interestingly, an accompanying survey to the release showed that 80% of 300 surveyed firms felt that they were prepared for a no deal Brexit. From a data perspective, the main standout was an upward revision to 0.3% from 0.2% for Q1 2019 GDP growth, whilst the MPC stated that inflation is expected to remain close to the 2% target over the coming months. However, Capital Economics highlight “all of this is only relevant if there is a smooth transition to a new trading relationship between the UK and the EU”. Nonetheless, both Capital Economics and Pantheon Macro look for the Bank to lift rates to 1% in H2 with Cap Eco highlighting that a 25bps hike could take place in the context of a 12-month delay to Brexit, whilst PM believe that “the 20% chance of a 2019 rate hike currently priced-in looks too low”.</p><p><strong>* NORGES: </strong>The Norges Bank hiked rates by 25bps, as expected to 1.00%, steepened the path of its repo rate, and posited that probabilities of a rise in H2 2019 are now over 50%, with this boosting the NOK by over 1% vs. the EUR. The Monetary Policy report saw the bank pencil in a steeper rate path, with 10bps added to the exp. 2019 &amp; 2020 rate (1.1% vs. prev. 1.0% and 1.6% vs. 1.5%) and the curve signalling a hair more than one hike in 2021 and flattening at around 1.75%. The Central Bank also raised non-oil GDP growth forecast for both 2019 and 2020 (2.7% vs. prev. 2.3% and 1.8% vs. prev. 1.6% respectively), alongside a further upgrade for 2019 core CPI expectations (2.3% vs. prev. 2.0%). The decidedly hawkish turn from the Norges Bank led Danske Bank to conclude that “the main takeaway from this meeting is that the robustness of the economy speaks for a gradual normalisation of rates despite global weakness”, and expect Norges to hike in June, with another in December, lifting rates to 1.50% at the end of 2019. Capital Economics also state that the balance of risks is that policymakers take the chance to hike rates twice in H2. They do warn, however, that if they are proven right in their assertion that oil prices will fall this year, they expect the Norges Bank to keep rates on hold throughout 2020. HSBC also cite structural factors as a point of fragility, specifically household debt, after the executive board noted “persistently high debt growth has increased household vulnerability” and debt growth “remains higher than growth in disposable income”.</p><p><strong>* SNB: </strong>The Swiss National Bank kept rates unchanged at -0.75% as expected with the target range similarly steady between -1.25% and -0.25%. Comments from the bank were largely unaltered from the previous meeting, they still see the CHF as highly valued and the FX markets situation is still fragile. As such, the SNB states that negative interest rates and a willingness to intervene in markets remains essential. Key change at this meeting refers to the inflation outlook, with 2019 inflation seen at 0.3% and 2020 seen at 0.6%, down from the priors of 0.5% and 1.0% respectively; Morgan Stanley regard this as the meetings key dovish signal, stating that in spite of the positivity surrounding growth the overall tone was dovish. Morgan Stanley also highlight that the SNB’s comments were somewhat designed to keep up with global monetary policy trend of dovishness. Looking ahead, ING state that negative rates are likely the norm for some time; emphasised by comments from SNB’s Chair Jordan that negative rates are to remain an important instrument. Consensus remains that the SNB is most likely to remain on hold until 2020 at the earliest.</p><p><strong>* PHILLY FED: </strong>The March Philly Fed index rose to +13.7 from February’s plunge to -4.1, also exceeding the expected +4.5, bringing “the Philly index back into line with the Empire State survey,” Pantheon Macroeconomics (PM) analyst note. PM say they would “be surprised if this report means that the index has bottomed.” They go on to cite China’s manufacturing slowdown acting as a headwind to global PMIs and highlight the meagre 4.3 point rise in new orders; “in short, we think manufacturing remains in deep trouble, but remember that the sector accounts for only about 12% of GDP and less than 9% of payrolls,” concluding that they do not see the manufacturing slowdown having “a material, sustained difference to the labour market.”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> It now appears that traders are pricing the risks of a no deal Brexit more aggressively, seeing a negative reaction in GBP. At the heart of the issue is the length of the extension the UK is requesting (30 June, according to PM May on Wednesday). The EU is conscious that a Brexit delay beyond 23-26 March, the date of the European Parliament elections, would cause constitutional issues if the UK did not field candidates. Accordingly, there has been reports, citing drafts, which suggest the EU was looking at an extension to 22 May, though this was subsequently dismissed via sources reports. As a contingency, it seems that the EU might be prepared to allow a 9-month extension if May fails to pass her deal, though how this would be digested by hardliners is questionable. There was also a date floated of 7 May, whether May passes her deal or not, which was said to be favoured by France's Macron. Indeed, May's choice at the end of next week might be between a no-deal or a long extension, according to a cabinet source quoted by Sky; the source believes that May would more likely pursue a no deal to appease the Conservative Party hardliners, and was sceptical that her deal could pass. Separately, May's spokesperson reiterated that the UK would not be revoking A50. At pixel time, we are still waiting for comments from May/Juncker/Tusk.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 0.25 LOWER AT USD 59.98; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.64 LOWER AT USD 67.86. </strong>Oil prices came off slightly from Wednesday’s YTD highs, with participants likely to be capitulating profits after the bullish inventory data. Although the market jumped after the DOE data, it was by no means a spectacular move for a surprise draw by almost 10mln bbls, in addition to deep drawdowns in the products. The lack of exuberance could well be attributed to the China trade suspense, “Cautious bulls will become unreservedly bullish if or when an agreement is struck between the two biggest economic powers,” PVM analysts speculate. Also feeding into the sell-off today was a stronger dollar, with the euro and the pound both depreciating against the greenback, in the midst of a more cautious risk tone spurred from Brexit woes and a cautious Fed. In news-flow: Iranian crude oil exports averaged 1.0mln-1.1mln BPD for March, which is down from February's level of 1.30mln BPD; Rosneft's Ryazan refinery (360k BPD) has halted its primary crude unit from March 17th until March 31st.</p><p><strong>* SPX +1.09% at 2855, NDX +1.52% at 7493, DJI +0.84% at 25963.

International Flavours (IFF) opened on a tailwind from an upgrade at Goldman. Caesars (CZR) traded higher on reports Golden Nugget Casino owner Tilman Fertitta is to make a second bid for the co. Tesla (TSLA) opened in the red as it was reported it had not raised auto prices by the full 3% it had previously pledged, however pared back in later trade after drone footage showed its Shanghai Gigafactory production had made progress.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 1+ TICKS LOWER AT 123-11+. </strong>At settlement, changes in Treasuries yields were modest. Some desks noted that after the aggressive post-Fed buying on Wednesday, more measured trading was to be expected, and the buying was most likely short-covering, and with fewer shorts, the buyside action was naturally more subdued. It is interesting that the effective Fed Funds Rate rose 1bps today to 2.41%, vs 2.40% over the last few weeks, with 2s yields trading below that level for a lot of the session, while the Fed Funds Rate eclipsed the IOER for the first time since the rate was launched in 2008. There was also a lot of attention on the 3-month/10-year spread, which was compressed to just 3.9bps at one point on Thursday (folks look at this spread as a more accurate gauge of recession risks, rather than 2s10s). Mortgage rates also dropped, helping some of the homebuilding names. The Treasury's sale of USD 11bln of 10-year TIPS was soft, tailing 1.1bps; the internals provided some encouragement, with the indirect participation jumping to 77% from 69%, pushing direct buyers participation lower. Going forward, some expect that, given G10 central banks aren't likely to all follow the Norges Bank higher, Treasuries could still be attractive to yield-hunters. Next week, the Treasury will auction USD 113bln in 2s/5s/7s, sizes unchanged vs the priors.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Despite the dovish Fed, USD trades higher, with some suggesting technical factors (the range of 96-97 in DXY seems to be in play, still). The performance of the EUR certainly helped; desks have noted that the EUR has also been subject to Brexit headline risk, and as the probability of a no deal Brexit rises, the EUR and GBP have been pressured (the Buck's strength against the JPY, for instance, was more modest). Most analysts had their base case that a Brexit deal can be reached, and what we have seen today is that thesis being challenged. Analysts had also assumed that the risk currencies might benefit from a dovish Fed, but that wasn't seen in the AUD, NZD, nor the CAD, with the latter seeing a 1.34 handle on a strong USD and declining crude. EMFX was also not pretty, with domestic drivers weighing on the BRL (see below), while the ZAR cannot catch a break given the load shedding woes as Eskom putting South African output under pressure.</p><p><strong>* NOK:</strong> While the NOK usually benefits from positive oil price moves, today's price action was sponsored by a hawkish Norges Bank, which lifted rates by 25bps, and hinted that we could see another hike in H2, seeing EURNOK charge through its 200DMA at ~9.64, and then through the Dec low. TD Securities maintained its bullish NOK view, arguing that Norway remains the only game in town in terms of policy divergence among G10 currencies. \"We think EURNOK could find a home in a new trading range that spans down toward 9.57, while NOKSEK may also sustain a move above 1.09 in the days ahead,\" TD wrote (TD sees fair value for the latter around 1.11). From a technical perspective, technicians suggested that if EURNOK maintain the new ground, it would represent a significant technical break.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The real was smacked on Thursday, after news emerged that ex-President Temer was arrested as part of anti-corruption investigations. One trader suggested that the arrest makes political conditions for reform more challenging. Brazil is hoping to push through pension reform before Parliament breaks for summer in July. The news followed a souring of market conditions on Wednesday on government plans to generate savings of BRL 10.4bln by overhauling pensions within the military, Reuters reported. That savings target was short of the BRL 93bln the government had projected just a month ago.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The pound largest daily fall of the year, as fears of a no deal Brexit ramp up. One Cabinet source reportedly stated that they were sceptical UK PM May's deal can pass next week, so May's choice might be a long Brexit extension, or a no deal (May leans towards the latter, according to her own comments, of late, while the sources believe May is also likely to go for this option to appease the party). The kicker is that over the last few weeks, the market has been assuming that a no deal Brexit was off the table (we have repeatedly cautioned against accepting this view); that narrative now is being challenged. Of course, EU negotiations often go to the wire, as we saw through the GFC, and much of this could be aggressive negotiating by May and the EU to push their respective positions through. But with that said, there are severely negative implications for the EU, under the conditions of a long-extension (elections on 23-26 May - a draft seen by newswires reprtedly stated that the EU would be prepared to only offer an extension up to 22 May, unless the UK fielded candidates), and Brexit threatens to hijack the narrative going into those elections, which could embolden more extreme candidates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* AUD, XAU:</strong> Has been boosted by a dovish Fed, and better than expected domestic employment data (a tightening labour market, which seems at odds with easing activity data, though wage growth remains the key for the RBA here, which it yet to show signs of any meaningful boost; additionally, will the labour market strength persist?). The labour market data has helped to slightly ease concerns that the RBA will be imminently dropping its neutral bias in favour of an easing bias. Additionally, looking ahead, AUD could even benefit from firmer iron ore prices. Barclays expects short term disruption in Australia's iron ore shipments, since a cat 4 tropical cyclone Veronica is expected to make landfall on Western Australia over the weekend, and shipping activities have already been suspended already. Barclays argues that the balance of risks to iron ore prices is now higher, underpinned by the prospect of more mine closures in Brazil (although overnight authorities announced they would return an operating license to Vale's Laranjeiras dam at the Brucutu mine, Vale has temporarily suspended Alegria mine due to inconclusive stress test results, which follows last week's closure of the Timbopeba mine). \"In particular the market is factoring very little risk premium into forward expectations, and in addition, a more dovish Fed remaining on hold notionally for the next two years and accepting of higher inflation is clearly positive miners and commodity prices.\" Barclays believes that gold, which has been a laggard YTD, is also likely to benefit, and could make up some of that underperformance vs other industrial commodities. Naturally, risks to the thesis would be any negative news on the US/China trade front.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

EMFX was also not pretty, with domestic drivers weighing on the BRL (see below), while the ZAR cannot catch a break given the load shedding woes as Eskom putting South African output under pressure.</p><p><strong>* NOK: </strong>While the NOK usually benefits from positive oil price moves, today's price action was sponsored by a hawkish Norges Bank, which lifted rates by 25bps, and hinted that we could see another hike in H2, seeing EURNOK charge through its 200DMA at ~9.64, and then through the Dec low. TD Securities maintained its bullish NOK view, arguing that Norway remains theonly game in town in terms of policy divergence among G10 currencies. \"We think EURNOK could find a home in a new trading range that spans downtoward 9.57, while NOKSEK may also sustain a move above 1.09 in the days ahead,\" TD wrote (TD sees fai value for the latter around 1.11). From a technical perspective, tecnicians suggested that if EURNOK maintain the new ground, it would represent a signifiant technical break.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>The real was smacked on Thurday, after news emerged that ex-President Temer was arrested as part of anti-corruption investigations. One trader sugested that the arrest makes political conditions for reform more challenging. Brazil is hoping to push through pension reform before Parliament breaks for summer in July. The news followed a souring of market conditions on Wednesday on government plans to generate savings of BRL 10.4bln by overhauling pensions within the military, Reuters reported. That savings target was short of the BRL 93bln the government had projected just a month ago.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The pound largest daily fall of the year, as fears of a no deal Brexit ramp up. One Cabinet source reportedly stated that they were sceptical UK PM May's deal can pass next week, so May's choice might be a long Brexit extension, or a no deal (May leans towards the latter, according to her own comments, of late, while the sources believe May is also likely to go for this option to appease the party). The kicker is that over the last few weeks, the market has been assuming that a no deal Brexit was off the table (we have repeatedly cautioned against accepting this view); that narrative now is being challenged. Of course, EU negotiations often go to the wire, as we saw through the GFC, and much of this could be aggressive negotiating by May and the EU to push their respective positions through. But with that said, there are severely negative implications for the EU, under the conditions of a long-extension (elections on 23-26 May - a draft seen by newswires reprtedly stated that the EU would be prepared to only offer an extension up to 22 May, unless the UK fielded candidates), and Brexit threatens to hijack the narrative going into those elections, which could embolden more extreme candidates. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* AUD, XAU: </strong>Has been boosted by a dovish Fed, and better than expected domestic employment data (a tightening labour market, which seems at odds with easing activity data, though wage growth remains the key for the RBA here, which it yet to show signs of any meaningful boost; additionally, will the labour market strength persist?). The labour market data has helped to slightly ease concerns that the RBA will be immenently dropping its neutral bias in favour of an easing bias. Additionally, looking ahead, AUD could even benefit from firmer iron ore prices. Barclays expects short term disruption in Australia's iron ore shipments, since a cat 4 tropical cyclone Veronica is expected to make landfall on Western Australia over the weekend, and shipping activities have already been suspended already. Barclays argues that the balance of risks to iron ore prices is now higher, underpinned by the prospect of more mine closures in Brazil (although overnight authorities announced they would return an operating license to Vale's Laranjeiras dam at the Brucutu mine, Vale has temporarily suspended Alegria mine due to inconclusive stress test results, which follows last week's closure of the Timbopeba mine). \"In particular the market is factoring very little risk premium into forward expectations, and in addition, a more dovish Fed remaining on hold notionally for the next two years and accepting of higher inflation is clearly positive miners and commodity prices.\" Barclays believes that gold, which has been a laggard YTD, is also likely to benefit, and could make up some of that underperformance vs other industrial commodities. Naturally, risks to the thesis would be any negative news on the US/China trade front.</p>",

Although the market jumped after the DOE data, it was by no means a spectacular move for a surprise draw by almost 10mln bbls, in addition to deep drawdowns in the products. The lack of exuberance could well be attributed to the China trade suspense, “Cautious bulls will become unreservedly bullish if or when an agreement is struck between the two biggest economic powers,” PVM analysts speculate. Also feeding into the sell-off today was a stronger dollar, with the euro and the pound both depreciating against the greenback, in the midst of a more cautious risk tone spurred from Brexit woes and a cautious Fed. In news-flow: Iranian crude oil exports averaged 1.0mln-1.1mln BPD for March, which is down from February's level of 1.30mln BPD; Rosneft's Ryazan refinery (360k BPD) has halted its primary crude unit from March 17th until March 31st.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: marked Central Bank divergence offers a welcome Brexit diversion, for most",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Some consolidation, short covering and more pronounced weakness in certain major rivals has helped the Buck stem post-dovish FOMC losses, while the DXY seems to have drawn a degree of technical encouragement from the fact that a key chart support level in the form of the 200 DMA (95.843) was tried and tested, but not completely breached. Indeed, the index is gradually building recovery momentum back above 96.000 vs 95.829 at one stage, with some fundamental impetus emanating from a firm rebound in the Philly Fed’s headline business index, sub-consensus initial claims and a firmer than forecast leading indicator that was embellished up a back month upgrade. DXY now around 96.500.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>Although the Dollar staged a relatively robust comeback, the Norwegian Krona remains the G10 front-runner, and by some distance. Eur/Nok was perched just under 9.6900 ahead of the Norges Bank policy verdict and accompanying statements, then hit lows close to 9.5900 as the benchmark rate was raised to 1% from 0.75% in line with expectations and forward guidance, alongside a steeper tightening trajectory through to 2021. The Bank now envisages further gradual hikes in H2 this year and next culminating at 1.75% and Governor Olsen added that there is a better than even chance of another ¼ point move in June. Justification for the hawkish outlook came via upward revisions to GDP and core inflation forecasts, with at least one bank now predicting 2 more hikes in 2019 (June and December).</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi are marginally outperforming, or rather holding up better than other major rivals amidst the ongoing Greenback revival, as the former continues to benefit from a multi-year low jobless rate and the latter retains an underlying bid post-as expected NZ Q4 q/q GDP ahead of next week’s RBNZ policy meeting. However, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are well off overnight peaks within 0.7167-115 and 0.6938-0.6867 ranges respectively.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Only brief solace for Sterling via stronger than expected UK retail sales data, as heightened Brexit uncertainty into the EU Summit saw Cable lose grip of 2 big figure handles (1.3200 and 1.3100) and Eur/Gbp rebound to within a few pips of 0.8700. In short, amidst the usual barrage of conflicting headlines and reports, PM May looks set to have her request for an A 50 extension to June 30 turned down as EU officials want to avoid any short technical delay from March 29 to end before the May 23 elections, while insisting that a postponement is contingent of HoC backing for the WA, which still looks a tall if not impossible order given deep divisions within the Cabinet, Tory Party and Parliament overall. For reference and the record, hardly any reaction to an unchanged and still largely Brexit dependent BoE.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>Yet another volatile session for the Loonie as Usd/Cad retraced almost a full 100 pips from 1.3274 to 1.3370, shrugging off decent Canadian data (ADP and wholesale trade) amidst technical trading and positioning for Friday’s more pivotal CPI and retail sales reports. Meanwhile, the single currency lost impetus after failing to extend gains vs the Usd to 1.1450 having probed above Fib resistance at 1.1420 and eyeing hefty option expiries between 1.1415-30 (2.9 bn). However, the subsequent pull-back to around 1.1360 was partly due to the aforementioned Dollar rebound and contagion from ongoing Pound weakness/underperformance.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>The Franc is showing some resilience amidst the Brexit malaise, especially vs the Eur as the cross retreats below 1.1300, but lost out to the Usd within a 0.9905-45 range following the SNB’s policy review that reaffirmed the need to NIRP and FX intervention to curb Chf strength/demand given its high valuation. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy bounced sharply from 110.30 to 110.95 as the post-FOMC dust settled and UST yields pared losses, while technical signals also reversed somewhat as multiple/confluent chart supports held from 110.20 through 110.24 to 110.29 (including the 55 DMA, a Fib and a trend-line).</p>",

The 10 year UK benchmark has now been up to 128.59 (+93 ticks) and closer to the next upside technical target having cleared the 128.24 continuation high, while Bunds are just off a fresh intraday peak of 164.93 (+68 ticks), with 164.97 and obviously 165.00 exerting a stronger magnetic pull. However, the tide seems to be turning somewhat in FX as the Dollar regains more composure or gleans support from counterpart weakness, and with chart traction given that support around 200 DMA and WMAs in the index effectively held (95.855 and 95.902 respectively vs 95.829 low and 96.000+ at present). Note, very little reaction to US and Canadian data.</p>",

The latest quarterly monpo report shows the bank pencilling in one hike in Q4, followed by another at the start of 2020 (previously, it saw the first hike in Q1 2020). \"The change in the Bank's stance has come against a backdrop of robust economic growth and rising core inflation pressures,\" Capital Economics said. \"It has made no secret of its desire to raise rates to help to reduce financial risks from high levels of household debt too.\" Capital Economics warns that the balance of risks is that policymakers take the chance to hike rates twice in H2, however, and if the economic consultancy is proved correct that oil prices will fall this year, the Norges Bank is more likely to keep rates on hold throughout 2020.&nbsp;</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>Major European indices are mixed, but are generally little changed [Euro Stoxx 50 U/C], following the dovish FOMC; which has led to underperformance in financial names with the sector significantly lagging its peers and the likes of Lloyds (-2.8%) and RBS (-5.3%) underperforming (RBS are trading ex-dividends). The FTSE 100 (+0.3%) has been supported from the open by a rebound in material names such as Fresnillo (+5.3%), Antofagasta (+2.6%) and Glencore (+2.2%); with the broader sector outperforming its peers in a turn around from the significant underperformance seen yesterday in the material sector which was attributed to Vale surpassing a key milestone in resuming production. Other notable movers include, Inmarsat (+2.1%) in the green after speculation surrounding a counterbid for the Co. after reports yesterday that investors made a bid valued at GBP 2.5bln. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are IG Group (-7.6%) after poor earnings figures and the Co. stating they expect FY revenue to be lower than the priors. Separately, Skanska (-2.6%) are lower as the Co. states that they are not likely to hit their 2019-20 construction margin target.</p><p>FX</p><p>NOK - In stark contrast to the dovish FOMC and steady SNB, the Norges Bank delivered the 25 bp hike flagged at the start of the year and signalled another ¼ point tightening for the 2nd half of 2019 before 2 more next year. The accompanying statement was also more upbeat/hawkish than most expected, with upgrades to growth forecasts and 2019 core CPI, while the Board added that the domestic economy may even expand faster than previously envisaged. Moreover, Governor Olsen went one step further by assigning better than even odds of a 25 bp hike in June, and Eur/Nok has slumped in response from around 9.6900 to just over 9.5900 at one stage.</p><p>DXY - The broad Dollar and index have pared some post-Fed losses, albeit mainly due to several rival G10 currencies failing to build on gains at the expense of the Greenback. Indeed, Usd/majors are somewhat mixed as the DXY reclaims 96.000 status, just. To recap, the FOMC was more dovish than expected given no further policy normalisation this year vs 2 hikes previously and confirmation that QT will end sooner than planned, with a slower monthly run-off from May and end by September.</p><p>NZD/AUD/JPY - The other big beneficiaries of Usd weakness, with the Kiwi reclaiming the 0.6900 handle and gleaning independent support to a mostly solid NZ Q4 GDP update, while the Aussie is firmly back above 0.7100 as sub-forecast jobs growth in February was countered by a near 8 year low unemployment rate. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has reversed sharply through 111.00 and to the lower end of a 110.75-30 range as US Treasury yields recoil in wake of the aforementioned Fed policy shift.</p><p>CAD/CHF/EUR/GBP - All underperforming to varying degrees, as the Loonie failed to sustain momentum through 1.3300 and the Franc resists advances towards 0.9900 in wake of the SNB quarterly policy review that maintained a high value assessment of the Chf amidst still fragile FX market conditions and the ongoing need for NIRP alongside close monitoring and intervention if needed. Meanwhile, the single currency has faded ahead of 1.1450 having cleared a Fib level at 1.1420 temporarily, and now looks prone to hefty option expiries at 1.1400 in 2.8 bn, with further upside attempts potentially capped by similar size between 1.1415-30 (2.9 bn). Turning to the Pound, Brexit remains the overriding issue and currently a mainly negative factor given even more uncertainty surrounding the conclusion and whether the EU is willing to grant an A 50 extension. Indeed, Cable only got a knee-jerk lift from better than forecast UK retail sales data before extending losses from 1.3200+ to circa 1.3135.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Some signs of fatigue or perhaps merely consolidation and a refuel, as Bunds ease off 164.84 Eurex highs and Gilts hover just under their 128.20 Liffe peak, but both retain healthy ½ point+ gains on the day in the post-dovish FOMC limelight. Technically, 164.97 and 128.24 are still the nearest bullish targets, while the US Treasury complex remains firmer and the curve flatter ahead of weekly claims, Philly Fed and the leading index before 10 year TIPS supply (Usd11 bn).</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (-0.3%) and WTI (-0.3%) are marginally softer, and remain affixed within a USD 1/bbl range. WTI did surpass the USD 60.0/bbl level overnight on the back of a dovish FOMC, however the complex has since drifted somewhat with WTI now trading just below the key level. Regarding the 9.6mln draw in EIA Crude Inventories reported yesterday, UBS note that this is bullish in respect to both the API’s 2.1mln draw and compared to the 5yr average for this period; of around +5.4mln.</p><p>Gold (+0.4%) is firmer, although off of session highs of around USD 1320/oz, on the back of dollar weakness after yesterdays dovish Fed, base metals more broadly have garnered support from the weaker dollar with copper rising to around a 3-week high overnight. Elsewhere, Barclays note that the risks surrounding iron ore have not dissipated following the reopening of Vale’s Brucutu mine as two others have been temporarily closed recently and there is a risk of further mine closures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The FTSE 100 (+0.3%) has been supported from the open by a rebound in material names such as Fresnillo (+5.3%), Antofagasta (+2.6%) and Glencore (+2.2%); with the broader sector outperforming its peers in a turn-around from the significant underperformance seen yesterday in the material sector which was attributed to Vale surpassing a key milestone in resuming production. Other notable movers include, Inmarsat (+2.1%) in the green after speculation surrounding a counterbid for the Co. after reports yesterday that investors made a bid valued at GBP 2.5bln. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are IG Group (-7.6%) after poor earnings figures and the Co. stating they expect FY revenue to be lower than the priors. Separately, Skanska (-2.6%) are lower as the Co. states that they are not likely to hit their 2019-20 construction margin target.</p><p>FX</p><p>NOK - In stark contrast to the dovish FOMC and steady SNB, the Norges Bank delivered the 25 bp hike flagged at the start of the year and signalled another ¼ point tightening for the 2nd half of 2019 before 2 more next year. The accompanying statement was also more upbeat/hawkish than most expected, with upgrades to growth forecasts and 2019 core CPI, while the Board added that the domestic economy may even expand faster than previously envisaged. Moreover, Governor Olsen went one step further by assigning better than even odds of a 25 bp hike in June, and Eur/Nok has slumped in response from around 9.6900 to just over 9.5900 at one stage.</p><p>DXY - The broad Dollar and index have pared some post-Fed losses, albeit mainly due to several rival G10 currencies failing to build on gains at the expense of the Greenback. Indeed, Usd/majors are somewhat mixed as the DXY reclaims 96.000 status, just. To recap, the FOMC was more dovish than expected given no further policy normalisation this year vs 2 hikes previously and confirmation that QT will end sooner than planned, with a slower monthly run-off from May and end by September.</p><p>NZD/AUD/JPY - The other big beneficiaries of Usd weakness, with the Kiwi reclaiming the 0.6900 handle and gleaning independent support to a mostly solid NZ Q4 GDP update, while the Aussie is firmly back above 0.7100 as sub-forecast jobs growth in February was countered by a near 8 year low unemployment rate. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has reversed sharply through 111.00 and to the lower end of a 110.75-30 range as US Treasury yields recoil in wake of the aforementioned Fed policy shift.</p><p>CAD/CHF/EUR/GBP - All underperforming to varying degrees, as the Loonie failed to sustain momentum through 1.3300 and the Franc resists advances towards 0.9900 in wake of the SNB quarterly policy review that maintained a high value assessment of the Chf amidst still fragile FX market conditions and the ongoing need for NIRP alongside close monitoring and intervention if needed. Meanwhile, the single currency has faded ahead of 1.1450 having cleared a Fib level at 1.1420 temporarily, and now looks prone to hefty option expiries at 1.1400 in 2.8 bn, with further upside attempts potentially capped by similar size between 1.1415-30 (2.9 bn). Turning to the Pound, Brexit remains the overriding issue and currently a mainly negative factor given even more uncertainty surrounding the conclusion and whether the EU is willing to grant an A 50 extension. Indeed, Cable only got a knee-jerk lift from better than forecast UK retail sales data before extending losses from 1.3200+ to circa 1.3135.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Some signs of fatigue or perhaps merely consolidation and a refuel, as Bunds ease off 164.84 Eurex highs and Gilts hover just under their 128.20 Liffe peak, but both retain healthy ½ point+ gains on the day in the post-dovish FOMC limelight. Technically, 164.97 and 128.24 are still the nearest bullish targets, while the US Treasury complex remains firmer and the curve flatter ahead of weekly claims, Philly Fed and the leading index before 10 year TIPS supply (Usd11 bn).</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (-0.3%) and WTI (-0.3%) are marginally softer, and remain affixed within a USD 1/bbl range. WTI did surpass the USD 60.0/bbl level overnight on the back of a dovish FOMC, however the complex has since drifted somewhat with WTI now trading just below the key level. Regarding the 9.6mln draw in EIA Crude Inventories reported yesterday, UBS note that this is bullish in respect to both the API’s 2.1mln draw and compared to the 5yr average for this period; of around +5.4mln.</p><p>Gold (+0.4%) is firmer, although off of session highs of around USD 1320/oz, on the back of dollar weakness after yesterdays dovish Fed, base metals more broadly have garnered support from the weaker dollar with copper rising to around a 3-week high overnight. Elsewhere, Barclays note that the risks surrounding iron ore have not dissipated following the reopening of Vale’s Brucutu mine as two others have been temporarily closed recently and there is a risk of further mine closures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Note, the 10 year German/Eurozone benchmark has now eclipsed its previous contract pinnacle to set a fresh high at 164.84, and its UK counterpart is now gunning for 128.24 (continuation chart high). Similarly, the Short Sterling strip is latching on to post-Fed gains elsewhere, and with the added impetus of ongoing if not greater Brexit uncertainty, as 3 month futures rally up to 4.5 ticks from June 2020 out. Ahead, retail sales and public sector finances before the BoE, and any of these could provide bulls with more fodder.</p>",

In addition, the rumour mill was rife with speculation heading into PM May’s press statement that she could suggest a defeat next week may lead to a general election or could even set out a timetable for her resignation, although these failed to materialize as PM May remained true to form in her defiance of the naysayers and reiterated calls for MPs to support her Brexit deal.

The Fed intends to have the balance sheet primarily consisting of Tsys after it has concluded BSN, and Powell sees the size at just over USD 3.5trln (around 17% of GDP vs around 25% at its peak).

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed as the region follows suit to the indecision seen stateside in the wake of a dovish FOMC in which the Fed lowered dot plot projections and now sees no rate hikes for this year and one in 2020 (Prev. forecast was for 3 hikes over 2-year horizon), while it also lowered near-term growth and inflation forecasts and announced to slow the balance sheet run off in May which will end in September. This immediately supported the risk sentiment, although the gains in the major US indices were later pared due to the underlying growth and trade concerns. ASX 200 (-0.5%) is negative as financials track the underperformance of their US counterparts post-FOMC and with a broad subdued tone across most sectors aside from commodity-related names. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) remain afloat with CITIC Securities suggesting increased possibility of a PBoC rate cut from the dovish Fed stance, although gains are capped amid lingering trade uncertainty as US President Trump recently suggested tariffs on China will be kept in place for a \"substantial\" amount of time after a trade agreement is struck to ensure Beijing holds up its end of the bargain. As a reminder, Japanese markets are shut for Vernal Equinox.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback suffered in the wake of the dovish-FOMC as projections suggested rate hikes were off the table for 2019. This dragged the DXY below the 96.00 level to the benefit of most its major counterparts and EM alike, which lifted EUR/USD above several key MA levels to reclaim the 1.1400 handle before hitting resistance just shy of 1.1450. GBP/USD whipsawed as markets were also tuned into Brexit developments after PM May requested an Article 50 extension to June 30th and with EU's Tusk suggesting approval of the short extension was conditional on parliament approving the Brexit deal next week. In addition, the rumour mill was rife with speculation heading into PM May’s press statement that she could suggest a defeat next week may lead to a general election or could even set out a timetable for her resignation, although these failed to materialize as PM May remained true to form in defiance of the naysayers and reiterated calls for MPs to support her Brexit deal. Elsewhere, antipodeans were active overnight with AUD/USD underpinned after mixed jobs data in which Employment Change missed estimates but was accompanied by a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 4.9% from 5.0%, while NZD/USD ignored varied GDP figures for Q4 and revisited post-FOMC highs.&nbsp;</p>",
