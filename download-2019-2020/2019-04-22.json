The waivers are set to formally expire on 2 May, though a State Department Official said the waiver-wind down period would be one year. US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US will end Iranian oil waivers for eight countries in May, Iran import will go to zero, adding that Saudi Arabia and UAE, as well as the US, has committed to ensure appropriate oil supply, and suppliers were working with Iranian customers to help the switch. This was followed-up by US President Trump, who said that the Saudis (who have recently been cutting supply by more than was required for the OPEC+ output cut agreement) would make up for the absence of Iranian crude on the international market (a Saudi source previously said the nation will first assess the impact on the oil market before raising output, but the nation was willing to compensate for any loss of supply). China, the largest international buyer of Iranian crude, again said it opposes unilateral US sanctions on Iran. A few questions remained unanswered: what is the pace of the wind down to be? One Indian source stating that from the beginning, there was talk of a gradual reduction and not going to zero in one swipe (India is the second largest buyer of Iranian crude). Some desks have also noted that the news comes as crude participants are awaiting developments on OPEC+ production policy, after recent questions whether Russia is fully committed to extending the supply cut agreement with OPEC partners, as it faces a dilemma between losing market share to the US, or competing for market share at lower oil price. Elsewhere, Eastern Libyan National Army stepped up its assault on Tripoli with airs strikes and heavy clashes reported over the weekend, although reports suggested that the Zawiya port and El Sharara oilfield are both still open.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES: </strong>March existing home sales fell to 5.21mln from 5.48mln in February, a larger fall than the expected 5.3mln. “February’s leap in sales never looked sustainable so a hefty correction was inevitable,” analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics note. They go on to highlight that the fall was less than what the market had feared may have been the case due to the slump in the pending home sales index. Rates have come back down significantly from their peak at the end of last year, and there have been SALT changes, both working as a tail wind for this year’s mortgage applications. “The rising trend in mortgage applications points clearly to rising existing home sales over the next few months, so inventory should fall, and prices should firm somewhat. The trend rate of increase for single-family home prices is now just under 4%, having slowed from almost 7% in the spring of 2017, but we don’t expect a further significant downshift,” the consultancy concludes.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.10% at 2908, NDX +0.3% at 7713, DJI -0.2% at 26513.

Boeing (BA) traded lower after the NYT reported that workers were under pressure to not report safety violations in the production of its 787 Dreamliner. Netflix (NFLX) benefitted from a positive note at Morgan Stanley, whose streaming video survey sees the streaming co. extending its leadership in terms of both usage and original content. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell after reports circulated that one of its cars exploded in China, four of its board members announced that they would not stand for re-election and CEO Musk criticised its lithium battery supplier Panasonic. The electric automobile maker also announced that Samsung (028260 KS) would make its chips. Samsung also announced a delay to the rollout of their new foldable phone. Under Armour (UAA) fell after Piper Jaffray negative note, with Nike (NKE) also moving lower in sympathy. Pfizer (PFE) and Eli Lily (LLY) opened lower after their co-developed pain killer failed in an advanced stage of the study.&nbsp;Merck (MRK) shares were initially buoyed after the pharma co.’s Kidney cancer drug Keytruda won FDA approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimberly-Clark (KMB) shares rose after the personal care co. reported increased profits and sales that fell less than expected. W. W. Grainger Inc (GWW) fell after the industrial supply company reported mixed Q1 earnings and management pointed to a weaker demand environment. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) plummeted after the medical robotics firm missed bottom line expectations in its Q1 earnings report.&nbsp;Kraft Heinz (KHC) was initially lifted after the company announced it was bringing in Anheuser-Busch InBev CEO Miguel Patricio, before paring gains to finish flat.&nbsp;Constellations Brands (STZ) shares moved higher after the firm benefitted from an upgrade at Jeffries. Blackstone (BX) moved higher after the private equity firm agreed to acquire a majority stake in Indian packaging supplier Essel Propack.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>The WSJ on the weekend reported that Fed officials are to begin discussing conditions under which they would cut interest rates, including a scenario where inflation drifts lower even if the economic growth doesn't falter. Such a scenario isn't seen as particularly likely, the newspaper said, and a rate cut is not imminent or under consideration for their meeting 30/April to 1/May. US President Trump announced that Herman Cain had requested not to be nominated to board of the Federal Reserve, following the recent resistance from both the Republican and Democratic sides to his nomination.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 122-30.</strong> Action was thin, as players were away for the long-weekend. But the bias was towards bear-steepening, with shorter yields up around 1bps, while the long-end of the curve was up around 3bps by settlement. Reports suggested specs, day traders and dealers were sellers from the 10-year through the 30-year space, with HFs selling across the curve. Some had also suggested that the sharp rise in oil prices was applying upwards pressure on yields.</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 133bln in 2-year (USD 40bln, Tuesday), 5-year (USD 41bln, Wednesday), 7-year (USD 32bln, Thursday), as well as a 2yr FRN (USD 20bln, Wednesday); with USD 107.2bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise a net USD 25.8bln in new cash. The Fed will allow USD 29.8bln to run off its balance sheet at month-end,and will add on a modest USD 0.6bln to 2s and 5s, USD 0.5bln to 7s, and USD 0.3bln to the FRNs. Recent auctions have been decent, with investors starved for returns, TD Securities said. \"While the market has trimmed their pricing for Fed rate cuts to 12bp from 33bp in 2019, investors continue to expect cuts this year and in 2020,\" the bank says, \"we believe that despite solid underlying fundamentals, expectations of a dovish Fed stance will help keep 10y rates pinned in the 2.40-2.60% range,\" and adds \"we similarly expect the Treasury to trim 2-3y auction sizes, aiding demand at the front-end.\" Recent averages a stop on the screws with a 63% buyside takedown, the bank predicts. It also notes that the sector has cheapened on the curve, which might be supportive.</p><p><strong>* PETRO-CURRENCIES: </strong>The currencies of oil exporters were up and importers down after crude reached new YTD highs. This follows the US announcing an end to Iranian oil import waivers from May. RUB, CAD and NOK were trading higher against the dollar by between 0.2-0.4% and TRY, INR, KRW were down between 0.3-0.4%.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Has done very little, and trades around neutral heading into APAC, largely ignoring PM Abe's ruling block suffered two rare by-election losses on the weekend in Osaka and Okinawa, in an apparent warning from voters not to get complacent ahead of a national election for parliament’s upper house later this year, Reuters reported. Friday's news that the BOJ had cut the size of its long-end Rinban operations saw the Japanese curve bear-steepen; to recap, 10-25yr purchases were cut to JPY 160bln (from JPY 180bln) and 25y+ cur to JPY 40bln (from JPY 50bln). Additionally, UBS notes that for operations of 10yr+, dealers can now sell 100% of the Rinban amounts vs a prior limit of 50%. \"This isn't a green light for dealers to offload inventory at every long end operation, rather the sizes have now become much smaller such that it would allow for a more efficient functioning of the market.\" The BOJ's policy meeting this week will also feature an outlook report, and some desks suggest that the BOJ could announce a new policy, with speculation underpinned by the recent dovish pivot at the Fed and ECB, which might see the BOJ follow suit.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The Telegraph reports that MPC members are on course for a split decision on rates at its 2 May meeting, with at least one member to make the case for a rate rise, the newspaper said, citing a source. Elsewhere, Brexit could begin returning to news feeds this weeks, as policymakers return from recess on Tuesday; UK PM May will this week be told that she must step down before the end of June, or Tory lawmakers might change leadership rules to force her out, the Times reported, amid suggestions that 70% of Conservative MPs want her resignation for botching Brexit talks and seeing a collapse in Tory support.</p><p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> The AUD failed to capitalise on the commodity upside, trading down around 0.3% heading into APAC trade whilst the Kiwi fell 0.2%. The Aussie slipped beneath its 200dma, while the NZD saw a bearish outside week, technicians note. Some desks remind us there is no Tier one data out of China this week, which might support the Antipodes, while the market looks to Aussie CPI on Wednesday, with Citi's analysts expecting the AUD to react more to downside than upside given that the RBA is laying the ground for potential dovish policy. However, with the labour market in strong shape, it will likely require a turning of the labour market to the downside to catalyse an imminent cut from the RBA, rather than spot inflation, Citi said.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The Brazilian Pension Secretary said the government will announce changes in the Pension Bill later on Monday and on Tuesday morning. The House’s Constitution and Justice Commission will then vote on the constitutionality of the proposed changes on Tuesday. Rabobank’s baseline scenario remains that effective pension reform will go ahead, reducing pension spending by 30% over 10 years, supporting their BRL projection of 3.70 against the dollar for the end of the year. However, the bank suggests that “slow-moving negotiation is poised to keep feeding higher perceptions of execution risks.”</p>",

Elsewhere, Brexit could begin returning to news feeds this weeks, as policymakers return from recess on Tuesday; UK PM May will this week be told that she must step down before the end of June, or Tory lawmakers might change leadership rules to force her out, the Times reported, amid suggestions that 70% of Conservative MPs want her resignation for botching Brexit talks and seeing a collapse in Tory support.</p><p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> The AUD failed to capitalise on the commodity upside, trading down around 0.3% heading into APAC trade whilst the Kiwi fell 0.2%. The Aussie slipped beneath its 200dma, while the NZD saw a bearish outside week, technicians note. Some desks remind us there is no Tier one data out of China this week, which might support the Antipodes, while the market looks to Aussie CPI on Wednesday, with Citi's analysts expecting the AUD to react more to downside than upside given that the RBA is laying the ground for potential dovish policy. However, with the labour market in strong shape, it will likely require a turning of the labour market to the downside to catalyse an imminent cut from the RBA, rather than spot inflation, Citi said.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The Brazilian Pension Secretary said the government will announce changes in the Pension Bill later on Monday and on Tuesday morning. The House’s Constitution and Justice Commission will then vote on the constitutionality of the proposed changes on Tuesday. Rabobank’s baseline scenario remains that effective pension reform will go ahead, reducing pension spending by 30% over 10 years, supporting their BRL projection of 3.70 against the dollar for the end of the year. However, the bank suggests that “slow-moving negotiation is poised to keep feeding higher perceptions of execution risks.”</p>",

The waivers are set to formally expire on 2 May, though a State Department Official said the waiver-wind down period would be one year. US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US will end Iranian oil waivers for eight countries in May, Iran import will go to zero, adding that Saudi Arabia and UAE, as well as the US, has committed to ensure appropriate oil supply, and suppliers were working with Iranian customers to help the switch. This was followed-up by US President Trump, who said that the Saudis (who have recently been cutting supply by more than was required for the OPEC+ output cut agreement) would make up for the absence of Iranian crude on the international market (a Saudi source previously said the nation will first assess the impact on the oil market before raising output, but the nation was willing to compensate for any loss of supply). China, the largest international buyer of Iranian crude, again said it opposes unilateral US sanctions on Iran. A few questions remained unanswered: what is the pace of the wind down to be? One Indian source stating that from the beginning, there was talk of a gradual reduction and not going to zero in one swipe (India is the second largest buyer of Iranian crude). Some desks have also noted that the news comes as crude participants are awaiting developments on OPEC+ production policy, after recent questions whether Russia is fully committed to extending the supply cut agreement with OPEC partners, as it faces a dilemma between losing market share to the US, or competing for market share at lower oil price. Elsewhere, Eastern Libyan National Army stepped up its assault on Tripoli with airs strikes and heavy clashes reported over the weekend, although reports suggested that the Zawiya port and El Sharara oilfield are both still open.</p>",

        "content": "<p>CAD – The stand-out G10 outperformer, more-so on the rise of oil prices after the US refused to grant extensions to Iranian oil waivers. USD/CAD resides just above the 1.3350 level having fluctuated in a 1.3355-94 intraday range ahead of the BoC rate decision this week.</p><p>AUD, NZD – The Aussie meanders around its 100 DMA at 0.7136 (having fallen below its 200 DMA last week), potentially on the back of subdued base metal prices with copper briefly losing the 2.90/lb handle in intraday trade. Meanwhile, NZD moves lower in sympathy with its Antipodean counterpart. Some desks remind us there is no Tier one data out of China this week which might support the Antipodes, while the market looks to Aussie CPI on Wednesday, with Citi's analysts expecting the AUD to react more to downside than upside given that the RBA is laying the ground for potential dovish policy. However, with the labour market in strong shape, it will likely require a turning of the labour market to the downside to catalyse an imminent cut from the RBA, rather than spot inflation.</p><p>EUR, GBP – The single currently largely mirrored USD moves amid a catalyst-deprived environment. EUR/USD resides around the 1.1250 level ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.1292. Elsewhere, Sterling is marginally softer against its G10 counterparts with Brexit risk seemingly crawling back into focus as the UK parliamentary recess ends tomorrow. Weakness in the Pound ahead of the US open coincided with a tweet by ITV’s Paul Brand, noting that 1922 Committee Chair Brady seeks top inform PM May of her departure date, which could either be May 22nd (EU elections) or June 30th (her requested Brexit extension date). Cable currently trades little changed just under 1.3000 ahead of its 200 DMA (1.2967) and 100 DMA (1.2955)&nbsp;</p><p>JPY – The Japanese currency largely ignored PM Abe's ruling block suffered two rare by-election losses on the weekend in Osaka and Okinawa, in an apparent warning from voters not to get complacent ahead of a national election for parliament’s upper house later this year, Reuters reported. Friday's news that the BOJ had cut the size of its long-end Rinban operations saw the Japanese curve bear-steepen at the tail end of last week. As a reminder, Thursday will see the BoJ’s latest rate decision which will include the Inflation Outlook report. The report will also take the first look into FY 2021, with sources stating that the Central Bank are to project FY 21 inflation above 1.5% but short of its 2% target, and FY 19 growth and inflation forecasts are expected to be cut.</p><p>EM – Mostly dictated by the energy complex as exporters benefit more-so than the importers as oil prices climb to YTD highs. USD/RUB lost the 64 handle having trading in a 63.75-64.06 range whilst importers such as Turkey, China and South Korea all bear the brunt of the firmer energy prices. USD/TRY advances above 6.7000 (vs. high 6.7190) whilst USD/CNH, USD/INR and USD/KRW all drifted higher as US disallowed a renewal of waivers on Iranian oil.&nbsp;</p>",

However, with the labour market in strong shape, it will likely require a turning of the labour market to the downside to catalyse an imminent cut from the RBA, rather than spot inflation.</p><p>EUR, GBP – The single currently largely mirrored USD moves amid a catalyst-deprived environment. EUR/USD resides around the 1.1250 level ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.1292. Elsewhere, Sterling is marginally softer against its G10 counterparts with Brexit risk seemingly crawling back into focus as the UK parliamentary recess ends tomorrow. Weakness in the Pound ahead of the US open coincided with a tweet by ITV’s Paul Brand, noting that 1922 Committee Chair Brady seeks top inform PM May of her departure date, which could either be May 22nd (EU elections) or June 30th (her requested Brexit extension date). Cable currently trades little changed just under 1.3000 ahead of its 200 DMA (1.2967) and 100 DMA (1.2955)&nbsp;</p><p>JPY – The Japanese currency largely ignored PM Abe's ruling block suffered two rare by-election losses on the weekend in Osaka and Okinawa, in an apparent warning from voters not to get complacent ahead of a national election for parliament’s upper house later this year, Reuters reported. Friday's news that the BOJ had cut the size of its long-end Rinban operations saw the Japanese curve bear-steepen at the tail end of last week. As a reminder, Thursday will see the BoJ’s latest rate decision which will include the Inflation Outlook report. The report will also take the first look into FY 2021, with sources stating that the Central Bank are to project FY 21 inflation above 1.5% but short of its 2% target, and FY 19 growth and inflation forecasts are expected to be cut.</p><p>EM – Mostly dictated by the energy complex as exporters benefit more-so than the importers as oil prices climb to YTD highs. USD/RUB lost the 64 handle having trading in a 63.75-64.06 range whilst importers such as Turkey, China and South Korea all bear the brunt of the firmer energy prices. USD/TRY advances above 6.7000 (vs. high 6.7190) whilst USD/CNH, USD/INR and USD/KRW all drifted higher as US disallowed a renewal of waivers on Iranian oil.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES: On the tail-end of a long-weekend for Europeans and US players, interest in Asia equities was light. In stock specific news, Huawei unveiled its first ever quarterly results, where Q1 revenue was up 39% to USD 27bln, and its net profit margin was around 8% in the quarter (slightly higher than the same period last year, though it did not specify a figure). Elsewhere in tech, Samsung has postponed media events for its Galaxy Fold planned for this week days after reports of defects in models sent to reviewers. China equities were lower after the Politburo saw downward economic pressure as structural in nature, adding that external economic environment was 'tightening' and it would step up proactive fiscal policy; the Central Financial Committee reiterated plan to increase financial support for real economy, and will fine tune monetary policy on growth and prices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;* ENERGY: Crude traded at fresh YTD highs on multiple reports that the US will not renew waivers that allowed eight countries (China, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey) to continue buying Iranian crude without incurring US sanctions. The waivers are set to formally expire on 2 May, and US Secretary of State Pompeo is reportedly to announce the decision on Monday. Sources said that the US will offset the loss of Iranian crude by announcing commitments from Saudi Arabia and UAE - a Saudi source said the nation will first assess the impact on the oil market before raising output, but the nation was willing to compensate for any loss of supply; an Iraq oil ministry spokesperson, however, said any decision to adjust output but be collectively taken by OPEC. China, the largest international buyer of Iranian crude, again said it opposes unilateral US sanctions on Iran. The move would represent a victory for foreign policy hawk John Bolton, who have argued that the US take a firm approach to push Iranian crude exports to zero (the nation's exports are running at a pace of 0.8mln BPD in April, according to Eikon data), after the Trump Administration pulled out from the 2015 Nuclear Accord with Iran in May last year. However, hope remains that the US might allow some crude from Iran, with one Indian source stating that from the beginning, there was talk of a gradual reduction and not going to zero in one swipe (India is the second largest buyer of Iranian crude). Some desks have also noted that the news comes as crude participants are awaiting developments on OPEC+ production policy, after recent questions whether Russia is fully committed to extending the supply cut agreement with OPEC partners, as it faces a dilemma between losing market share to the US, or competing for market share at lower oil price. In recent news flow, as a sign of escalating tensions reports indicate that Iran are to close the strait of Hormuz if they are prevented from using it. Elsewhere, Eastern Libyan National Army stepped up its assault on Tripoli with air strikes and heavy clashes reported over the weekend. &nbsp;</p><p>* TREASURIES: Overnight, 10yr JGBs were flat amid the indecisive risk tone, and with prices nursing the weakness after last Friday’s BoJ Rinban reduction. The US Treasury will auction USD 133bln in 2s/5s/7s as well as a 2yr FRN; with USD 107.2bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise a net USD 25.8bln in new cash. The Fed will allow USD 29.8bln to run off its balance sheet at month-end, and will add on a modest USD 0.6bln to 2s and 5s, USD 0.5bln to 7s, and USD 0.3bln to the FRNs. The WSJ on the weekend reported that Fed officials are to begin discussing conditions under which they would cut interest rates, including a scenario where inflation drifts lower even if the economic growth doesn't falter. Such a scenario isn't seen as particularly likely, the newspaper said, and a rate cut is not imminent or under consideration for their meeting 30/April to 1/May.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;* USD: The USD seems more bid against EMs rather than G10 FX, after news that waivers allowing some nations to purchase Iranian crude could end or be tapered on 2 May, and traders take a cautious stance in thin trade, where European players are away for the long Easter weekend. Currencies of crude importers are facing pressure (INR, KRW both down around 0.3% vs the USD), but crude exporters fared better (CAD, RUB up around 0.2% and 0.3% vs the USD respectively). &nbsp;</p><p>* GBP: The Telegraph reports that MPC members are on course for a split decision on rates at its 2 May meeting, with at least one member to make the case for a rate rise, the newspaper said, citing course. Elsewhere, Brexit could begin returning to news feeds this weeks, as policymakers return from recess on Tuesday; UK PM May will this week be told that she must step down before the end of June, or Tory lawmakers might change leadership rules to force her out, the Times reported, amid suggestions that 70% of Conservative MPs want her resignation for botching Brexit talks and seeing a collapse in Tory support. &nbsp;</p><p>* JPY has largely ignored PM Abe's ruling block suffered two rare by-election losses on the weekend in Osaka and Okinawa, in an apparent warning from voters not to get complacent ahead of a national election for parliament’s upper house later this year, Reuters reported. Friday's news that the BOJ had cut the size of it's long-end Rinban operations saw the Japanese curve bear-steepen at the tail end of last week. To recap, 10-25yr purchases were cut to JPY 160bln (from JPY 180bln) and 25y+ cur to JPY 40bln (from JPY 50bln). Additionally, UBS notes that for operations of 10yr+, dealers can now sell 100% of the Rinban amounts vs a prior limit of 50%. \"This isn't a green light for dealers to offload inventory at every long end operation, rather the sizes have now become much smaller such that it would allow for a more efficient functioning of the market.\" The BOJ's policy meeting this week will also feature an outlook report, and some desks suggest that the BOJ could announce a new policy, with speculation underpinned by the recent dovish pivot at the Fed and ECB, which might see the BOJ follow suit. &nbsp;</p><p>* AUD, NZD: The Aussie slipped beneath its 200dma, while the NZD saw a bearish outside week, technicians note. Some desks remind us there is no Tier one data out of China this week which might support the Antipodes, while the market looks to Aussie CPI on Wednesday, with Citi's analysts expecting the AUD to react more to downside than upside given that the RBA is laying the ground for potential dovish policy. However, with the labor market in strong shape, it will likely require a turning of the labor market to the downside to catalyse an imminent cut from the RBA, rather than spot inflation, Citi said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>* SPAIN ELECTION: Spain's Socialists extended their lead in an ABC poll ahead of elections on Sunday, though at 31.5% still lack a majority. &nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SUMMARY:</strong>&nbsp;Overnight, multiple reports suggested that the US will cease Iranian oil purchasing waivers. US Secretary of State Pompeo is said to announce this in early US hours on Monday [at 8:45 ET], according to sources. Alongside the announcement, sources added that Pompeo will also unveil commitments from other suppliers (such as Saudi and UAE) to offset the loss from the waiver expiries. Oil prices spike to YTD highs on the news, with Brent crude jumping as much as 3%, to levels last seen in November; the WTI/Brent Arb widened to over -8.30/bbl vs. USD -8/bbl on Thursday (and around USD -7/bbl last Monday).</p><p><strong>* BACKGROUND:</strong>&nbsp;Last year, after the US pulled out of the 2015 between Iran and six other countries, it placed sanctions on Iran’s financial system before introducing a second set of sanctions on oil supply in November. To avoid a spike higher in oil prices, the US granted eight countries temporary waivers to import Iranian oil, set to expire on May 2nd, 2019, in return, the US asked for countries to reduce Iranian oil imports to zero.</p><p><strong>* CURRENT WAIVERS:</strong></p><ul><li>CHINA – Allowed to import as much as 360k BPD of Iranian oil</li><li>SOUTH KOREA – 200k BPD of ultra-light oil, i.e. condensate</li><li>INDIA – Permitted to import as much as 300k BPD of crude oil</li><li>JAPAN – Tanker tracker data showed March loadings of just over 100k BPD</li><li>TURKEY – Permitted to purchase around 60k BPD</li><li>TAIWAN - Reduced Iranian oil imports to zero</li><li>ITALY - Reduced Iranian oil imports to zero</li><li>GREECE - Reduced Iranian oil imports to zero</li></ul><p><strong>* RHETORIC:</strong>&nbsp;Some desks have also noted that the news comes as crude participants are awaiting developments on OPEC+ production policy, after recent questions whether Russia is fully committed to extending the supply cut agreement with OPEC partners, as it faces a dilemma between losing market share to the US, or competing for market share at lower oil price.</p><p><strong>* SAUDI</strong>&nbsp;– The Kingdom may reportedly be willing to increase output to offset the losses resulting from the waiver expiries, according to a Saudi source. It is however unclear how this will clash with the OPEC output reduction pact.</p><p><strong>* CHINA</strong>&nbsp;– China Foreign Minister spokesmen, when asked about the reports on waivers, noted that China has consistently opposed US’ implementation of unilateral sanctions.</p><p><strong>* INDIA</strong>&nbsp;– India is said to be hoping that US will provide some sort of flexibility regarding Iranian oil sanction waivers, according to sources familiar with US-India talks.</p><p><strong>* IRAN</strong>&nbsp;– Oil Ministry source stated that the US will fail at cutting Iranian oil exports to zero. Energy Journalist Reza Zandi noted that potential reactions from Iran may include: 1) Oil supply may be disturbed, 2) US is harming oil market stability via the sanctions and 3) Concerns on the security of global energy supply. There has been a suggestion that Iran might close the Straits of Hormuz if prevented from using it, it was reported on Monday, in a sign of increasing geopolitical tensions.</p><p><strong>* US</strong>&nbsp;– Iranian Special Representative Hook previously cautioned that the sudden removal of Iranian crude from the market (around 1mln BPD) could cause a spike in prices, he recently highlighted that the US was “on the fast track to zeroing out all purchases of Iranian crude”.</p>",

KOSPI (-0.2%) was stable above the 2200 level and Shanghai Comp.

Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat amid the indecisive risk tone and with prices nursing the weakness after last Friday’s BoJ Rinban reduction.</p><p>In FX markets, price action was mostly uneventful with the DXY marginally softer after a slight pullback from last week’s data-driven gains but remained above the 97.00 level amid a subdued tone in most its major counterparts. EUR/USD and GBP/USD were lacklustre amid European-wide market closures including the UK for Easter Monday with the latter also having recently given up the 1.3000 handle, although the quiet tone could be short-lived with Parliament set to return from the Easter recess on Tuesday and with PM May facing increased pressure from within the Tory party ranks to stepdown or face being ousted. Elsewhere, continued strength in crude prices has benefitted the CAD, while antipodeans were less emphatic amid weakness in China and with AUD/USD also dampened by cross-related flows in which AUD/NZD and AUD/JPY gave up the 1.0700 and 80.00 handles respectively.</p><p>Oil stole the limelight overnight in which Brent crude futures briefly broke above USD 74.00/bbl with gains of as much as 3.2%, while WTI crude closely followed and broke firmly above the USD 65.00/bbl level on several bullish supply-side factors including reports that the US is to announce the end of Iran oil sanction waivers and an increased offensive by Khalifa Hafter forces on Libya’s capital over the weekend. In addition, the latest Baker Hughes rig count also showed a decline in active rigs, while some also noted the recent win by United Conservative Party’s Kenney in Alberta, Canada was another tailwind for the energy complex as he had previously threatened legislation to ‘turn off the taps’ that would allow Alberta to restrict the amount of energy leaving the province. Elsewhere, gold prices were marginally higher amid mild softness in the greenback overnight and copper was subdued amid the indecisive risk appetite in the region but with downside stemmed amid strength in Chinese commodity prices in which Dalian iron ore and Shanghai Rebar gained around 3% at the open.</p>",
