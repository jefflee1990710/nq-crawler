Although, the same cannot be said for UK Parliament, as the DUP have stated they will be voting against the deal; for reference, the DUP have typically been propping up the Conservative parties’ former majority. The loss of the DUP is a significant blow to the prospects of the deal getting through parliament; although, given the ERG have stated they will not necessarily vote in lock-step with the DUP and as many see this as a deal or no-deal scenario, it may pass. But, as always with UK politics, will come down to the wire. Unsurprisingly, UK assets have had a very volatile session. Cable printing session and recent highs just shy of the 1.30 mark at best with the low at 1.2750 illustrating how volatile today has been. In terms of what lies ahead, UK Parliament is to hold a special Saturday sitting this weekend where PM Johnson will attempt to pass his deal through Parliament. If he fails, PM Johnson will be compelled by the Benn act to write to the EU seeking an extension until January; something he has said he will abide by, but simultaneously will ensure we leave on October 31st, with some suggesting he may have a trick up his sleeve. In the event the deal passes through Parliament it is then a race to complete the necessary legal process by October 31st otherwise a short technical extension becomes likely.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY/SYRIA: </strong>US Vice President Pence announced a deal has been reached with Turkey for a ceasefire in Northern Syria, where Turkey will pause its operation to allow the withdrawal of YPG forces for 120 hours. Consequentially, the US will not impose further sanctions with the implementation of the ceasefire, Pence said Trump has agreed to withdraw economic sanctions after the implementation of the deal. Turkish Foreign Minister threw some water on the fire later by saying this was not a ceasefire, ceasefires are only between two legitimate sides; adding that Turkey agreed with the US on the collection of heavy arms from the YPG and the destruction of their positions. Meanwhile, in the background, a bipartisan group of US Senators approved a bill that would hit Turkey with wide-ranging sanctions, and despite the aforementioned remarks from Trump and Pence, a senator spokeswoman announced they will still go ‘full steam ahead’ with the proposed sanctions. Elsewhere, the topic of the EU’s response to Turkey’s military incursion into Northern Syria will not feature at the EU Council Summit meeting, with Dutch PM Rutte looking for a stronger response from the EU on the incursion, although he is not optimistic, he will succeed.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 2998, NASDAQ-100 0.3% at 7942, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27026,</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.3%, Consumer Staples 0.4%, Energy 0%, Financials 0.1%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 0.5%, Information Technology -0.2%, Materials 0.2%, Telecommunication Services 0.6%, Utilities 0.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) surged on the open amid a strong profit and in-line revenues, despite disappointing Q4 subscriber guidance; many participants were cautious on the stock heading into the earnings therefore the strong profits were rather unsurprised.<strong> </strong>Morgan Stanley (MS) lead banks higher after its beat on both EPS and revenue with very strong FICC trading, NII higher Q/Q, although equity revenue fell Y/Y.<strong> </strong>Phillip Morris<strong> </strong>(PM) drifted higher on a mixed earnings report whilst raising its dividend. Honeywell (HON) beat on EPS, missed on revenue however raised its FY19 EPS and margin guidance.<strong> I</strong>BM (IBM) gapped lower as revenue fell short (again) and global tech service revenue fell 5.6% Y/Y, with the RedHat acquisition failing to hold up the DJIA component. Dover (DOV) surged on a profit beat. Union Pacific (UNP) took a hit after missing top and bottom line estimates amid declining Freight volume. Textron (TXT) lower as revenue fell short. M&amp;T Bank (MTB) lower as it missed expectations on EPS and NII was unchanged. Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) traded higher after being granted Chinese regulatory authority to begin production in the region. Apple (AAPL) was supported by positive mentions at Barclays and Wedbush.</p><p><strong>* US OCTOBER PHILLY FED: </strong>The Philly Fed headline fell by more than expected, to 5.6 from 12.0, against the consensus 7.6. Analysts have noted that index has recently been much stronger than other regional Fed surveys, and this still does little to narrow the gap. Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that the average level of the five Philly sub-indexes -- which also comprise the national ISM manufacturing index -- nudged down only slightly, and among them, new orders rose to a 17-month high. \"As a result, the Philly numbers continue to point to a much higher ISM, which will not happen as long as the trade war persists,\" Pantheon writes, noting that the Philly Fed region exports much less than the US as a whole, and China accounts for a relatively small share of those exports, so it is less exposed to the trade war, and argues that it will overstate the ISM for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, from a prices perspective, firms continued to report overall increases in prices paid for inputs, but the prices paid index fell 16 points to 16.8. Nearly 24% of respondents reported higher input prices, down from 38% in September; the current prices received index, reflecting the manufacturers' own prices, decreased 4 points to a reading of 16.4.</p><p><strong>* US SEPTEMBER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION:</strong> The headline fell by more than expected, at -0.4% M/M (exp. -0.1%), as did manufacturing (-0.5% M/M vs. exp. -0.2%), while capacity utilisation fell to 77.5%, against an expected decline to 77.7%. The GM strike was always likely to weigh on the data, analysts have said, although the 4.2% fall in production of autos and parts fared better than some analysts had predicted; while there has been a deal agreed between GM and unions, it may take a couple of weeks to ratify, suggesting the manufacturing output may provide further downside in the October data. Elsewhere, manufacturing output fell, with desks drawing on survey evidence to argue that the outlook does not look particularly encouraging for the months ahead, and some are warning that it could start hitting manufacturing jobs in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>* US SEPTEMBER HOUSING STARTS/BUILDING PERMITS: </strong>Mixed data, with starts coming in at 1.256mln, short of the 1.32mln view, however, revisions to the prior help offset the downside; while permits came in at 1.387mln, above the expected 1.35mln. BMO says the data was really all down to the notoriously volatile multifamily sector, with starts -28.2% M/M in the sector, and permits -8.2% M/M, while single-family gained.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said there is currently no invitation from China for further talks in Beijing, saying both him and Lighthizer are prepared to travel to China. On the Treasury currency report, Mnuchin has not yet decided how to treat China but had discussions with Chinese officials on currency that made the Treasury more comfortable. China’s MOFCOM reiterated that the US must lift all tariffs which were implemented from July last year to end the trade war, and that Beijing is open to a partial deal. Both sides have maintained close relations as they work towards a deal. Elsewhere, in response to the US implementing ‘reciprocal’ measures on Chinese diplomats to notify state dept. of their visits and what their plans are, the Chinese foreign ministry has urged the US to withdraw restrictions. Also of note, US has begun investigation into a dumping of glass containers imported from China.</p><p><strong>* US TREASURY SEMI-ANNUAL CURRENCY REPORT:</strong> The US Treasury's semi-annual currency report is due for release in October, but Politico has reported that the timing of the release could depend on whether the US administration's efforts to conclude the \"phase one\" deal with China proceed smoothly, or break down between now and the APEC meeting in mid-November. After the Treasury designated China a currency manipulator in August, markets will be eying its explanation. In its previous report, the Treasury tweaked the criteria required to receive such a designation, and analysts believe that China only meets one of the three criteria (it has a large bi-lateral trade surplus above USD 20bln; analysts do not believe conditions of a current account surplus above 2% and large one-sided FX interventions tests have been satisfied), whereas the designation of 'currency manipulator' requires two of the conditions to be met. There is, therefore, a possibility that the US could rescind its designation, has has been hinted by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in recent weeks; such a move will be seen by the market as a positive for US/China trade negotiations.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN GDP: </strong>German government has cut 2020 GDP GDP growth forecast to 1.0% (Prev. 1.5%), maintains 2019 at 0.5%, German Economy Minister says there is no risk of an economic crisis even if current outlook is subdued.</p><p>* <strong>AUSTRALIA SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT:</strong> The Australian economy added 17.7k jobs in September, with 26.2k of those full-time jobs; the jobless rate fell by one-tenth to 5.2%. Analysts said that, while the data provides little for the RBA to add to a dovish narrative, desks noted that the underlying softness in the trend is consistent with the central bank's easing undertaking already, and will likely support arguments for further easing ahead; with that said, some have noted that the strong data will dampen speculation of an imminent move from the central bank.</p><p><strong>WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.57 HIGHER AT USD 53.93/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.49 HIGHER AT USD 59.91/BBL: </strong>Crude prices were choppy on Thursday, but ultimately ramped higher into the close amid book squaring as WTI options expired. On the inventory report benchmarks did head lower, with headline EIA inventory data showing a large build in crude inventories, as API data had indicated the night before. However, the mixed nature of the release resulted in some back and forth action, as distillates showed a larger than expected draw and refinery utilisation unexpectedly declined. Inventory data releases aside, the crude complex moved as a function of broader risk sentiment; with (albeit brief) upside seen alongside equities on the news that the UK and EU had agreed a new Brexit deal. WTI Nov’ 19 futures, which expire today, managed to keep its head above the USD 52.80/bbl mark, and remain within recent USD 52.40/bbl – USD 53.80/bbl ranges. Similarly, Brent Nov 19’ futures remain within recent USD 58.00/bbl – USD 59.70/bbl parameters. Elsewhere, OPEC+ Technical Committee finds deal compliance in September at 236%, according to two OPEC sources.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 129-29. </strong>The TPLEX settled little changed after a choppy day of trade. Participants initially sold the haven assets on the completion of the Brexit deal in early trade but pared losses throughout the rest of the session, lacking much conviction in late doors. Curve was little changed at settlement with yields up approximately up 1bp across the curve.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX: GBP</strong> continued its rally this week as a Brexit deal between the EU and UK has been accepted and backed by all EU27 members. The GBP rally did fade slightly as worries persist around the parliamentary arithmetic, with all eyes on Saturday. GBPUSD rose to highs just shy of 1.30, a level not seen since May. <strong>DXY </strong>weaker today following a slew of mixed US data with Philly Fed business index falling to 5.8, missing expectations to for a reading of 8, Industrial production also fell further than expected. <strong>EUR </strong>was firmer today likely taking its cues from a falling greenback, however it is wroth noting despite EUR strength, the German government confirmed that its 2020 GDP growth forecast has been cut to 1% from a prior 1.5%, however it maintained its 2019 GDP forecast at 0.5%, but the German Economy Minister added there is no risk of an economic crisis even if the current outlook is subdued. EURUSD found resistance at 1.1140, as it traded in a range of 1.1066-1.1139, the top end of this range had not been seen in the cross since late August. <strong>Havens:</strong> <strong>JPY </strong>firmer against the buck, but not much else, USDJPY found resistance at former support level 108.43, trading in a range of 108.48-108.93 with participants still eyeing the 200dma at 109.08, albeit the cross trades in the middle of the aforementioned parameters heading into Asia-Pac trade. <strong>XAU </strong>remained under the make-or-break 1,500 psychological level on Thursday trade, finding highs at 1497 following rather weak US data and worries on UK parliamentary arithmetic. <strong>CHF </strong>among outperforming currencies today following strong swiss trade data and strong Swiss Watch exports. Both <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> higher today helped by a weaker greenback, AUD also largely benefited from an upbeat jobs report which saw strong fulltime employment, with NZD rising in the slipstream. In EMFX, <strong>TRY </strong>was volatile although headed into the US close on the front foot with USDTRY briefly breaching 5.82 to the downside as US VP Pence and President Trump announced the latest sanctions would not be implemented following a ceasefire agreement on Syria between the US and Turkey, although, there have been conflicting reports. <strong>ZAR </strong>also stronger amid a falling buck, although its state owned utility company Eskom announced some of its generating units are back in service and now the chances of power cuts over the weekend have narrowed, adding the government should announce the appointment of anew CEO before the end of October. <strong>MXN </strong>flat against the buck, and <strong>BRL </strong>weaker.</p>",

On the inventory report benchmarks did head lower, with headline EIA inventory data showing a large build in crude inventories, as API data had indicated the night before. However, the mixed nature of the release resulted in some back and forth action, as distillates showed a larger than expected draw and refinery utilisation unexpectedly declined. Inventory data releases aside, the crude complex moved as a function of broader risk sentiment; with (albeit brief) upside seen alongside equities on the news that the UK and EU had agreed a new Brexit deal. WTI Nov’ 19 futures, which expire today, managed to keep its head above the USD 52.80/bbl mark, and remain within recent USD 52.40/bbl – USD 53.80/bbl ranges. Similarly, Brent Nov 19’ futures remain within recent USD 58.00/bbl – USD 59.70/bbl parameters.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound remains hostage and at the whim of breaking Brexit news, with early reports that the DUP is still dissatisfied with the draft proposals drawn up by UK and EU negotiators late last night pushing Cable down further from highs and Eur/Gbp in the opposite direction. However, as the clock ticked down to the official start of the EU Summit Sterling was boosted by headlines hailing that the last few sticking points had been resolved and various EU diplomats claimed that the deal was back on or even done, with subsequent confirmation from UK PM Johnson that appeared to imply that the DUP was also now on side. Cable clawed back all and a whole lot more of its declines in the way to and through 1.2900 before surpassing 1.2950 and only just topping out ahead of 1.3000, while Eur/Gbp recoiled to circa 0.8575 only for the tables to spin round again when the Tory’s coalition party stated equivocally that it has not retracted any objections and cannot support the plan in its current form. Hence, MV4 beckons in Parliament on Saturday and the result looks set to go right down to the wire, as Cable ‘consolidates’ close to 1.2850 and Eur/Gbp hovers near 0.8650.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to the yo-yo trade noted above, it’s been pretty one-way traffic if not plain sailing for the Aussie and Kiwi that have steadily built on gains after scaling 0.6800 and 0.6300 handles respectively. Upbeat jobs data and less dovish RBA implications underpinned Aud/Usd, and Nzd/Usd has risen in the slipstream as the Aud/Nzd cross remains capped ahead of 1.0800.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>All benefiting from a generally weak Greenback, with the <strong>DXY </strong>rooted towards the base of a 98.118-97.476 range after more broadly downbeat US data (ip, housing starts and headline Philly Fed), but also gathering technical momentum following encouraging fundamental impulses in the case of the Franc (Swiss trade and watch exports) and Loonie (Canadian manufacturing sales eclipsing more dated ADP payrolls). Usd/Chf picked up pace on a breach of 0.9900, Eur/Chf once 1.1000 gave way and Usd/Cad when 1.3150 yielded, while the Euro is holding above 1.1100 against the Buck, but off best levels and largely tracking its UK counterpart and the Yen is mainly trading with overall risk sentiment between 108.54-93 parameters.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/TRY/ZAR</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona continues to underperform on a bearish concoction, with Eur/Nok retesting all time highs around 10.2000, but this indirectly aiding the Sek on cross positioning and despite bleak Swedish unemployment rates in the run up to next week’s Riksbank meeting. However, the recently woeful Lira and Rand have both managed to regroup and net some gains, with the former welcoming vibes from the US state visit and reports about a shift towards diplomacy and latter deriving stronger traction after rebounding through 15.0000.</p>",

        "subject": "BREXIT ANALYSIS: Can UK PM Johnson get the 320 votes needed to approve the latest Brexit deal",
        "content": "<p><strong>THE LATEST:</strong> The UK and EU have formally agreed a upon a Brexit deal, which will be put to EU27 leaders for approval at the EU Council Summit today and tomorrow, after which it will be put to the UK House of Commons for approval on Saturday. Expectations are that the deal should not face any difficulties in receiving approval from the EU side moving forward. The largest hurdle now appears to be getting the deal through the UK House of Commons, something current UK PM Johnson’s predecessor May failed at three times.</p><p><strong>PARLIAMENTARY ARITHMATIC:</strong></p><p><strong>259 are likely to back the deal</strong> – On former UK PM May’s final attempt to get her Brexit deal through parliament, 279 Conservatives backed her deal. However, since then a group of these MPs have been either expelled from the party or left. It is expected that the remainder, however, are likely to back the deal.</p><p><strong>The 19 expelled Tories – </strong>They were expelled from the party for voting for the passage of the Benn Act, which mandated UK PM Johnson to request an extension had he failed to reach an agreement with the EU before 19 October, a law that the government argued undermined their negotiating position. Desks have noted that some voted for the Benn Act out mistrust in UK PM Johnson, fearing his true strategy was to pursue a no deal exit. These MPs may be looking for a way back into the party, hence, they may be inclined to vote for the revised deal. However, other MPs, such as former Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond, have been pushing for a closer relationship with the EU that would see the UK stay in the EU’s customs union and may be more difficult to sway.</p><p><strong>The DUP 10</strong> – The Party released a statement saying they would vote against the deal, not abstain, in line with an earlier statement which raised concerns over the issues of consent and VAT.</p><p><strong>The 28 Eurosceptic “Spartans”</strong> - Conservative MPs who refused to vote for May’s deal, headed by MP Steve Baker. They would prefer a no deal to the deal in its current form. However, in recent weeks Baker has been less hawkish; on Tuesday he was optimistic Johnson could reach a “tolerable” deal. Given the fact that the Benn Act essentially takes no deal at the end of the month off of the table, after which there is likely to be either a general election or second referendum, these ultra-Eurosceptic MPs may fear that this deal could be there last opportunity to deliver Brexit. Two of the “Spartans” are in Johnson’s cabinet, and thus are fairly likely to back the deal.</p><p><strong>Labour rebels? A possible 20</strong> – A number of Labour members preside over leave voting constituents. Former UK PM May gambled that such MPs would want to honour the referendum and support her deal, but only managed to get 5 Labour rebels to back her deal. However, since then the sands have shifted; the Labour Party is officially backing a second referendum now rather than pursuing its own Brexit deal, while the Liberal Democrats want to revoke Article 50 rather than have a second referendum – an unequivocal shift towards more pro-remain positions. As such, 15 Labour MPs who didn’t back May’s deal signed a letter to the EU urging them to do a deal with the UK, indicating that this time around they would vote for a deal. However, a key part of Labour’s election strategy is to defeat the UK government by voting down a deal and forcing an extensions (something that would embarrass UK PM Johnson given his “do or die” pledge to leave with or without a deal). As such, Labour MP will be whipped to vote against any deal else they risk expulsion.</p><p><strong>5 Independents – </strong>Four of the five voted for former UK PM May’s deal, while the fifth, John Woodcock, may also be tempted.</p><p><strong>2 Other MPs</strong> – Liberal Democrat MP Lamb, who presides over a leave voting seat, has been critical of his party’s anti-Brexit stance. UK PM Johnson’s brother Jo Johnson voted for May’s last deal and, despite resigning from his post in the current government, may be inclined to vote for the government’s deal.</p><p><strong>IN TOTAL:</strong> Out of the pool of 84 MPs listed above, Johnson needs to secure the votes of 61 in order to get his deal through parliament. Saturday’s special Parliamentary sitting will be the crunch time, with the vote likely between the hours of 9.30-14.00 BST.</p>",

The FTSE 100 (+0.5%) enjoyed some early outperformance on an initially weaker pound but remain choppy as the currency surged on the latest Brexit updates, although the index is supported by domestic banks and housing names. Separately, some outperformance is being seen in periphery bourses (FTSE MIB +0.8%, IBEX 35 +0.8%); Italy’s Cabinet yesterday approved its draft 2020 budget and submitted it to the EU, while the latest polling out of Spain saw the country’s conservative People’s Party making healthy gains following the sentencing of Catalan separatist leaders at the expense of the ruling Socialist Party (ahead of 10 November elections). Sectors are mixed but mostly in the green, with outperformance seen in Health Care (+0.6%) and underperformance in Tech (-0.1%). Energy (+0.5%) is higher despite lower crude prices. Chip names, including Wirecard (-2.9%), were weighed after Taiwan’s TSMC warned of a single digit Y/Y decline in global semiconductor market growth this year in its earnings report (although Q3 earnings were strong). In terms of notable movers; Ericsson (+6.7%) shot higher after the Co. posted strong earnings, including an increase to its 2020 revenue guidance. Unilever (+1.0%) were also buoyed by decent earnings. Conversely, weak earnings from Faurecia (-4.3%), Telia (-5.2%) and Pernod Ricard (-3.4%) saw their respective stocks under pressure. Elsewhere, Iliad (+4.8%) shares moved higher after the Co. was upgraded at JPM.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD -</strong> The Antipodean Dollars are outperforming in wake of overnight data showing an unexpected dip in the Aussie unemployment rate and a jobless tally that would have almost doubled consensus barring a decline in the part time count. Aud/Usd has crossed the 0.6800 mark, with perhaps some added impetus from positive Chinese trade chat regarding the outcome of recent talks in Washington, and nudging towards one of several hefty option expiries spanning the big figure (see 7.02BST post on the headline feed for details of all today’s major NY cut rollovers). In similar vein, the Kiwi has reclaimed 0.6300, albeit lagging in cross terms as Aud/Nzd rebounds over 1.0750 and sets sights on 1.0800 again.</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> Sterling may not quite be the biggest G10 winner, but it remains well on top in cumulative price and volatility terms given another 200+ pip gap from top to toe in Cable and full point+ range in Eur/Gbp. Another cascade of Brexit-related headlines has been paramount, and especially those relating ongoing intransigence from the DUP over several components of the compromised draft treaty hammered out by UK and EU negotiators. In short, EU diplomats and PM Johnson have declared that a deal is finally back on or even done pending Parliament approval, but HoC approval remains in doubt even discounting DUP rejection. However, the Pound has emerged from its latest bout of whipsaw trade firmer, albeit off best levels and seemingly relieved if not completely satisfied that another hurdle has been overcome, or perhaps merely assuming that enough progress towards a final withdrawal agreement has been achieved to warrant a further (technical) extension rather than a no deal departure on October 31. Cable is holding above 1.2900 and Eur/Gpp around 0.8600.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Greenback is softer across the board, with the DXY dipping under 97.500 and only the safest-havens alongside a few other laggards faring worse than the Buck ahead of more top tier US data/Fed speak and post-disappointing retail sales on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD -</strong> All benefiting from a largely Brexit-inspired upturn in risk sentiment, not to mention the aforementioned US Dollar demise, with the single currency scaling 1.1100, Franc back up near 0.9900 and Loonie edging closer to 1.3150 in advance of Canadian manufacturing sales.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK -</strong> The Scandi Crowns are striving to stop the rot after plumbing new multi-year/record lows in wake of significantly weaker than forecast Swedish labour stats, but the Nok is lagging after slipping below 10.2000 even though the data may yet convince the Riksbank to roll back or possibly remove its rate hike guidance next week.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment Change (Sep) 14.7k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 34.7k). (Newswires) Australian Full Time Employment Change (Sep) 26.2k (Prev. -15.5k) Australian Unemployment Rate (Sep) 5.2% vs. Exp. 5.3% (Prev. 5.3%)</strong> Australian Participation Rate (Sep) 66.1% vs. Exp. 66.2% (Prev. 66.2%)</p><p>RBA watcher McCrann believes the RBA will leave its Cash Rate unchanged at the upcoming meeting following the Australian labour market report. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Although the DUP may still hold out and it remains far from certain whether PM Johnson is able to do what his predecessor could not, debt futures have only manged a partial recovery from lows posted on the back of the latter claiming that a great deal has finally been forged with the EU to replace the backstop. For the record, Gilts have been down to 130.80, Bunds 170.73 and 10 year T-notes 129-16+ awaiting the next episodes in the saga/drama ahead of Saturday’s HoC showdown, and with US data plus Central Bank rhetoric providing some passing interest in the interim.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>A choppy session thus far for WTI and Brent futures </strong>which initially received a double whammy from larger-than-forecast US crude stockpiles and as sentiment took a turn for the worse as Brexit developments reach a stalemate on the domestic front, albeit prices saw upside as EU announced that a Brexit deal has been reached. As a recap, the weekly API data (which was delayed due to Monday’s US Columbus Day holiday) showed a US inventory build of 10.5mln barrels vs. Exp. build of 2.9mln barrels. WTI and Brent futures immediately declined some 0.3-0.4/bbl and continued to be pressured throughout the APAC and early EU sessions. WTI futures reside just around the 53/bbl mark (having tested 52.75/bbl overnight) whilst Brent futures gained ground above 59/bbl level but pared some of the gains. Traders will continue eyeing Brexit/US-Sino newsflow for sentiment-driven action whilst the EIA is due to report weekly crude stocks at 1600BST with the headline forecast to show a build of 2.878mln barrels. Elsewhere, gold prices are flat intra-day and within a tight range below 1500/oz (1483-93/oz) as the yellow metal eyes Brexit developments, whilst copper recovered some losses and moved into positive territory amid mostly constructive comments from China’s MOFCOM whilst the red metal received a boost from the aforementioned Brexit headlines.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>API Crude Inventories +10.5mln vs. Exp. +2.9mln (Prev. +4.1mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p>",

The FTSE 100 (+0.5%) enjoyed some early outperformance on an initially weaker pound but remain choppy as the currency surged on the latest Brexit updates, although the index is supported by domestic banks and housing names. Separately, some outperformance is being seen in periphery bourses (FTSE MIB +0.8%, IBEX 35 +0.8%); Italy’s Cabinet yesterday approved its draft 2020 budget and submitted it to the EU, while the latest polling out of Spain saw the country’s conservative People’s Party making healthy gains following the sentencing of Catalan separatist leaders at the expense of the ruling Socialist Party (ahead of 10 November elections). Sectors are mixed but mostly in the green, with outperformance seen in Health Care (+0.6%) and underperformance in Tech (-0.1%). Energy (+0.5%) is higher despite lower crude prices. Chip names, including Wirecard (-2.9%), were weighed after Taiwan’s TSMC warned of a single digit Y/Y decline in global semiconductor market growth this year in its earnings report (although Q3 earnings were strong). In terms of notable movers; Ericsson (+6.7%) shot higher after the Co. posted strong earnings, including an increase to its 2020 revenue guidance. Unilever (+1.0%) were also buoyed by decent earnings. Conversely, weak earnings from Faurecia (-4.3%), Telia (-5.2%) and Pernod Ricard (-3.4%) saw their respective stocks under pressure. Elsewhere, Iliad (+4.8%) shares moved higher after the Co. was upgraded at JPM.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - The Antipodean Dollars are outperforming in wake of overnight data showing an unexpected dip in the Aussie unemployment rate and a jobless tally that would have almost doubled consensus barring a decline in the part time count. Aud/Usd has crossed the 0.6800 mark, with perhaps some added impetus from positive Chinese trade chat regarding the outcome of recent talks in Washington, and nudging towards one of several hefty option expiries spanning the big figure (see 7.02BST post on the headline feed for details of all today’s major NY cut rollovers). In similar vein, the Kiwi has reclaimed 0.6300, albeit lagging in cross terms as Aud/Nzd rebounds over 1.0750 and sets sights on 1.0800 again.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - Sterling may not quite be the biggest G10 winner, but it remains well on top in cumulative price and volatility terms given another 200+ pip gap from top to toe in Cable and full point+ range in Eur/Gbp. Another cascade of Brexit-related headlines has been paramount, and especially those relating ongoing intransigence from the DUP over several components of the compromised draft treaty hammered out by UK and EU negotiators. In short, EU diplomats and PM Johnson have declared that a deal is finally back on or even done pending Parliament approval, but HoC approval remains in doubt even discounting DUP rejection. However, the Pound has emerged from its latest bout of whipsaw trade firmer, albeit off best levels and seemingly relieved if not completely satisfied that another hurdle has been overcome, or perhaps merely assuming that enough progress towards a final withdrawal agreement has been achieved to warrant a further (technical) extension rather than a no deal departure on October 31. Cable is holding above 1.2900 and Eur/Gpp around 0.8600.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Greenback is softer across the board, with the DXY dipping under 97.500 and only the safest-havens alongside a few other laggards faring worse than the Buck ahead of more top tier US data/Fed speak and post-disappointing retail sales on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD </strong>- All benefiting from a largely Brexit-inspired upturn in risk sentiment, not to mention the aforementioned US Dollar demise, with the single currency scaling 1.1100, Franc back up near 0.9900 and Loonie edging closer to 1.3150 in advance of Canadian manufacturing sales.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK </strong>- The Scandi Crowns are striving to stop the rot after plumbing new multi-year/record lows in wake of significantly weaker than forecast Swedish labour stats, but the Nok is lagging after slipping below 10.2000 even though the data may yet convince the Riksbank to roll back or possibly remove its rate hike guidance next week.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Although the DUP may still hold out and it remains far from certain whether PM Johnson is able to do what his predecessor could not, debt futures have only manged a partial recovery from lows posted on the back of the latter claiming that a great deal has finally been forged with the EU to replace the backstop. For the record, <strong>Gilts</strong> have been down to 130.80, <strong>Bunds</strong> 170.73 and 10 year <strong>T-notes</strong> 129-16+ awaiting the next episodes in the saga/drama ahead of Saturday’s HoC showdown, and with US data plus Central Bank rhetoric providing some passing interest in the interim.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A choppy session thus far for <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures which initially received a double whammy from larger-than-forecast US crude stockpiles and as sentiment took a turn for the worse as Brexit developments reach a stalemate on the domestic front, albeit prices saw upside as EU announced that a Brexit deal has been reached. As a recap, the weekly API data (which was delayed due to Monday’s US Columbus Day holiday) showed a US inventory build of 10.5mln barrels vs. Exp. build of 2.9mln barrels. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> <strong>futures</strong> immediately declined some 0.3-0.4/bbl and continued to be pressured throughout the APAC and early EU sessions. WTI futures reside just around the 53/bbl mark (having tested 52.75/bbl overnight) whilst Brent futures gained ground above 59/bbl level but pared some of the gains. Traders will continue eyeing Brexit/US-Sino newsflow for sentiment-driven action whilst the EIA is due to report weekly crude stocks at 1600BST with the headline forecast to show a build of 2.878mln barrels. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices are flat intra-day and within a tight range below 1500/oz (1483-93/oz) as the yellow metal eyes Brexit developments, whilst <strong>copper</strong> recovered some losses and moved into positive territory amid mostly constructive comments from China’s MOFCOM whilst the red metal received a boost from the aforementioned Brexit headlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Nomura's quants expect little clear direction in sentiment until around 5th November, seeing the interim period as one during which the market will be “laying the foundation” for the next risk-on phase. Nomura acknowledges that its proprietary US equity sentiment gauge has formed a double-bottom pattern, with troughs in August and October, which it says may be a positive sign; the bank argues that the pattern suggests that US equity supply and demand is likely to take a turn for the better towards the end of the year. Although there are still areas of uncertainty in areas such as the global economy, and US-China trade issues, the bank says “if sentiment follows its usual distinctive rhythm, the risk of a predictable sell-off in US equity may have retreated somewhat.”</li><li>Moreover, Nomura adds that alongside the next phase of risk-on sentiment, there may be a factor rotation. “Heightened risk-taking appetite tends to cause the performance of the low-vol factor (low-beta longs and high-beta shorts) to go into reverse,” argues the bank, although they caveat that “low-vol tends to behave differently in different markets and warrants close observation.”</li><li>However, the bank notes there is one concerning signal, in that hedge funds' aggregate exposure to equities is still low, and has become largely decoupled from sentiment. Moreover, it adds, systematically trading CTAs have “put the brakes” on their allocation shift from bonds to stocks. Nomura speculates that hedge funds may be looking at the market's recent gains with some scepticism; in the time since the US-China trade stand-off re-escalated in early May, they have been repeatedly been burned when they have bought equities in anticipation of a resolution to the conflict.</li><li>Trend-chasing systematic CTA players seem to be in standby mode, Nomura observes. Since 15 October, they have halted exiting their long positions in US equities, as major US stock indices have all moved back above the key thresholds for trend-following strategies. Nomura estimate these levels to exist at around 2,970 for the S&amp;P 500, 7,750 for the NASDAQ 100, and 26,680 for the DJIA; should these indices hold above these levels, “it is probably only a matter of time before CTAs resume buying” the bank suggests.</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX ultimately settled firmer after a choppy session. Haven flows were price supportive as the buck weakened whilst gold firmed – participants were cautious ahead of an official Brexit deal announcement, in addition to a disappointing US retail sales report, which caused some concern on the resilient consumer segment. At settlement the curve had steepened slightly with the 30-year yield little changed, whilst the 2-year yield fell ~3.5bps. US T-note (Z9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 129-31+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Beige Book stated the US economy expanded at a slight to modest pace since the prior report</strong> as business activity varied across the country, Furthermore, household spending was solid on balance and the housing market conditions changed little, while manufacturing activity continued to edge lower and agricultural conditions deteriorated further.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed after the lacklustre tone initially rolled over from Wall St where all majors finished with marginal losses as participants digested earnings and with sentiment dampened by weak data in which US Retail Sales unexpectedly contracted for the 1st time in 7 months. ASX 200 (-0.5%) is led lower by underperformance in tech and with mining names closely behind including BHP after its quarterly updates showed iron ore output was flat Y/Y, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) is choppy around the 22500 level and near its YTD highs with mild JPY weakness just about keeping the index afloat. Conversely, Hang Seng (+1.0%) outperforms as property names surge and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) just about shrugged off early losses following recent comments by China’s Cabinet that it will step up efforts to attract foreign investment and will not allow forced technology transfers, while China will also ensure lower tax for manufacturing and other sectors.</p><p>In FX markets, USD remains subdued after the unexpected contraction in Retail Sales data placed doubts regarding the health of the US consumer which saw the DXY briefly give up the 98.00 level, while its major counterparts hold on to recent strength with EUR/USD consolidating near the prior day’s highs and in proximity to notable option expiries at 1.1090-92 for today’s New York cut. GBP/USD is also flat north of the 1.2800 level after the recent heightened Brexit-related optimism, although a deal has so far been elusive as VAT provisions have not yet been agreed upon with ERG and DUP support still hanging in the balance. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses marginally extend on recent gains and antipodeans are also firmer against the greenback with AUD/USD the outperformer following a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.2% from 5.3% which saw OIS prices in just a 27% chance of the RBA cutting rates next month from around 39% prior to the data release.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as Japanese stocks remain near 10-month highs and with participants also sidelined ahead of a 5yr JGB auction later.</p>",
