The minutes also noted that a couple of members said they supported the cut but it was a close call and a couple of policymakers also suggested the Fed should reinforce the statement with communications that another rate cut is unlikely without signs of a significant slowdown.</p><p>Policymakers were divided on the inflation outlook as some favoured maintaining rates and stated the outlook was favourable with inflation expected to rise, while some thought it is temporary and a couple saw inflation above 2% in 2020 due to tariff. Furthermore, policymakers said risks remained tilted to the downside and they all agreed negative rates are not an attractive tool but could reassess if need be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>Phase One US-China trade deal may not be completed this year, according to reports citing trade experts and people close to the White House.&nbsp; The reports added that US President Trump and US Trade Representative Lighthizer recognize that rolling back tariffs for a deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues will not be seen as a good deal for the US. In addition, there were reports in People's Daily that noted Chinese President Xi's trip to Brazil as the last international trip for him this year which suggests no international trade deal signing is scheduled. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump said we continue to talk with China and reiterated they want a deal, while he later reiterated that China wants to make a deal and suggested that the question is if he wants to make a deal because he likes what's happening right now with the US taking in billions and billions of dollars. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>White House Deputy Press Secretary said negotiations are continuing and progress is being made on the text of the US-China phase-one agreement.

US-China trade deal hopes were already called into question in the earlier session following US Congress voting in unanimous support for the pro-democracy, Hong Kong bill, something China Global Times referred to as the \"Support HK Violence Bill\". US equity bourses retreated from their winning streak, posting their largest losses in weeks, although thy did pare back some of the move heading into the close, the tech-focused NDQ failed to retreat as much as the SPX and DJIA. Boeing (BA) had a 777X jet order from Emirates cancelled and replaced with a smaller order for 30 787 Dreamline jets, although at list prices, is worth USD 8.8bln. Hologic (HOLX) traded higher on a USD 205mln sale of its Cynosure, its medical aesthetics unit, to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Carl Icahn announced a new short position on mall debt, which weighed on the REIT Macerich. AT&amp;T (T) traded in the red following a cautious Keybanc note, which cited a first look at data that shows poor subscriber trends for its October figures. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) were hit as its Opdivo study in combination with Yervoy did not meet a statistically significant benefit in its study for patients with high melanoma risk. Salesforce (CRM) updated it guidance and traded firmer, which also benefited Workday (WDAY). General Motors (GM) filed a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and three former executives; the suit comes from a federal corruption probe into illegal payments from FCA to UAW officials, with GM alleging a multiyear intentional scheme of unlawful payments to the union officials.

The haven asset was already on the front-foot throughout the Asia session, following the pro-democracy HK bill in the US, and then caught a second wind on reports the trade deal was unlikely to be signed this week. The curve continued to bull-flatten with the FOMC minutes confirming a Fed on pause, barring a material worsening of the outlook. The 2s30s flattened by 3bps, with the 30-year yield down 6bps.

US-China trade deal hopes were already called into question in the earlier session following US Congress voting in unanimous support for the pro-democracy, Hong Kong bill, something China Global Times referred to as the \"Support HK Violence Bill\". The bill comes at a crucial time for the Trump administration, throwing a spanner in the works for negotiations for the phase one deal. US equity bourses retreated from their winning streak, posting their largest losses in weeks, although thy did pare back some of the move heading into the close, the tech-focused NDQ failed to retreat as much as the SPX and DJIA. Interestingly, the usually China trade sensitive crude complex failed to give up its strong gains, reversing Tuesday's losses amid a bullish EIA inventory report. The T-Note held onto its gains post the Phase One signing delay news, although JPY faded its strength; XAU was little changed on the day after experiencing small fluctuations in sympathy with risk appetite on the day. CNH was an underperformer as the PBOC cut its 1&amp;5-year LPR rates by 5bps as expected, in addition to negative trade reports moving further away from the heavily eyed 7.00 handle.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>Overnight, US Commerce Secretary Ross said he believes there is hope US can get a China deal done, though added that the deal was still a work in progress. In pre-market European trade, it was reported that a phase one trade deal, that was supposed to be a limited agreement, may morph into something bigger if US President Trump agrees to Beijing’s demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, according to sources familiar with the talks. The sources added that Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling tranche of tariffs scheduled 15th December tariffs on USD 156bln of Chinese consumer goods, needed deeper concessions from China. Chinese Global Times Editor said that few Chinese believe that US/China can achieve a trade deal soon, adding that, given poor China policy from US, the belief is that the significance of a potential deal will be limited, and the Chinese were prepared for prolonged trade war. Elsewhere, after the Commerce Department this week said it would extend Huawei waivers, it confirmed that it has begun issuing some licenses for some US companies to supply non-sensitive goods to the China telecoms giant, although sources later stated companies are receiving mixed approvals of denials and requests to sell to Huawei from the commerce department. In later trade, Reuters reported that 'Phase One' US/China trade deal may not be completed this year, Reuters said citing trade experts and people close to the White House, noting that Trump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that rolling back tariffs for a deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues will not be seen as a good deal for the US, a person briefed on the matter said.<strong> </strong>Later, President Trump reiterated China wants to make a deal, but noting the question is whether he wants to make a deal, “because I like what’s happening right now, we’re taking in billions of dollars”. Heading to the closing bell, A Chinese publication, People’s Daily, noted in an article that Chinese President Xi’s trip to Brazil was the last international trip for him this year, indicating no international trade deal signing.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG: </strong>Following the US Senate's decision to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on Tuesday -- requiring annual reviews of HK's special status, which could see its special status under US law potentially being withdrawn if the City is not seen to be sufficiently autonomous from mainland China -- China threatened retaliation, with its Foreign Minister once again urging the US to stop meddling in China's affairs before it is 'too late'. For further analysis regarding the possible implications, please see our briefing <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-senate-passes-hong-kong-human-rights-bill-how-will-it-affect-trade-talks-20-11-2019\">here.</a></p><p><strong>* FOMC MINUTES: </strong>Most<strong> </strong>Fed policymakers judged that after the October 30th rate cut the policy level would be appropriate barring a material reassessment of the outlook, the Fed minutes revealed to little surprise, although specifics were slim. The usual suspects of global weakness and trade uncertainty were cited by many as their rationale for the cut, some cited the proximity of the FFR to the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) as to why they favoured a cut, although some favoured maintaining rates (Rosengren and George were the two voting dissenters, although other non-voters have suggested there opposition to the recent cut since), and perhaps more interestingly, some said their support for the cut was a close call, indicating there could be some people leaning towards the hawkish view, although recent Fed commentary has echoed this. The minutes showed a divided Fed regarding the inflation outlook, although they agreed that risks maintain tilted to the downside. However, the Fed was united in agreeing that negative rates were not an attractive tool, but the stance could be revaluated if need be, whilst several noted the importance of fiscal policy if monetary policy were to become constrained at the ELB. In regard to market operations, using balance sheet tools to limit long-term Treasury rates were discussed; majority saw more benefits from using the balance sheet to cap short-term rates as well as forward guidance, whilst only a few saw the benefit of using the balance sheet to cap long-term rates. Regarding the funding market pressures, the Desk noted a diminished willingness of some dealers to intermediate across money markets ahead of year-end could result in upward pressure on short-term money market rates; the Desk discussed its intentions to further adjust operation at year-end. A conference call on October 4th was held to review the repo market pressures, there was a view that the pressures could re-emerge around the April 2020 tax season; additionally, the pros and cons of a standing repo facility were discussed. Some expressed a willingness to let the FFR to move outside of its target range at dates of technical events, whilst some expressed concern for such.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed Governor Brainard (dove, voter) noted that trade uncertainty was a major theme weighing on the economy, citing business investment and manufacturing. While the Fed has taken out insurance, Brainard noted that business contacts still noted that the uncertainty was forcing contacts to remain on the side-lines in terms of business investment, warning that the uncertainty alone can be a factor reducing business investment and certainty, as reflected in some of the incoming data. Brainard was encouraged by the resilient US consumer, which continued to feel good about the jobs market. Looking ahead, Brainard sees above growth trend in 2020. Brainard said she'd be looking for a material change in the outlook to shift her view.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> Following cuts to its key interbank rates earlier in the month, and the liquidity injections this week, the PBOC continued to loosen policy, cutting its new one- and five-year Loan Prime Rate by 5bps apiece to 4.15% and 4.80% respectively. \"The 5-year LPR cut is quite sensitive this time,\" UBS wrote, \"investors were looking at whether the 5-year rate will be adjusted as it shows the stance towards the property sector, given the mortgage rate is now linked to long-end LPR.\" UBS also noted that President Xi’s famous vow (\"House is for living in not for speculation\") was quietly removed from PBOC's Q3 Monetary Policy Statement earlier in the week, which has already prompted speculation that there could be a marginal easing or a policy relaxation in the property sector. UBS suggests that the 5bps cut in 5-year LPR would be read as additional evidence.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB Vice President de Guindos said that the side effects of monetary policy were becoming more evident, though he did not believe that current settings are close to the 'reversal rate'; de Guindos also said that risks were not so tilted to the downside, and that the ECB needs to see how the September stimulus package takes effect. ECB’s Makhlouf, delivering his first policy address as an ECB member, said external risks were heightened at present, and that the macroeconomic outlook was mixed. Makhlouf sees protracted weakness in the Eurozone, noting that hard and soft data in H2 has pointed towards a continuation of moderate growth. Tomorrow sees the release of the latest ECB minutes; <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/23274/download\">click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.4% at 3108, NASDAQ-100 -0.7% at 8284, Dow Jones -0.4% at 27821</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.3%, Consumer Staples 0.2%, Energy 1%, Financials -0.5%, Health Care -0.1%, Industrials -0.8%, Information Technology -0.7%, Materials -1.2%, Telecommunication Services -0.8%, Utilities 0.6%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS</strong>: A solid sign for the consumer as both Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW) reported strong figures. TGT soared to an all time high as it traded 12% higher on the day following EPS and revenue beats whilst also raising its FY EPS guidance. LOW rallied around 5% on an EPS beat and a raise in FY EPS forecasts, although revenue fell slightly short, but it did affirm its FY revenue view. However, Urban Outfitters (URBN) fell 13% after an EPS and revenue miss, whilst its Urban Outfitter chain SSS came in flat.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing (BA) had a 777X jet order from Emirates cancelled and replaced with a smaller order for 30 787 Dreamline jets, although at list prices, is worth USD 8.8bln. Hologic (HOLX) traded higher on a USD 205mln sale of its Cynosure, its medical aesthetics unit, to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Carl Icahn announced a new short position on mall debt, which weighed on the REIT Macerich. AT&amp;T (T) traded in the red following a cautious Keybanc note, which cited a first look at data that shows poor subscriber trends for its October figures. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) were hit as its Opdivo study in combination with Yervoy did not meet a statistically significant benefit in its study for patients with high melanoma risk. Salesforce (CRM) updated it guidance and traded firmer, which also benefited Workday (WDAY). General Motors (GM) filed a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and three former executives; the suit comes from a federal corruption probe into illegal payments from FCA to UAW officials, with GM alleging a multiyear intentional scheme of unlawful payments to the union officials.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 1.66 HIGHER AT USD 57.01/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 1.49 HIGHER AT USD 62.40/BBL. </strong>Crude markets reversed their Tuesday losses, where gains accelerated on the bullish EIA report and failed to reverse on negative China trade updates. The benchmarks were subdued overnight following the 6mln bbl API reported build in US crude stocks, however, as Europeans came to their desks the complex moved higher, as it has done as of recently, before the EIA report hit. The official report showed crude building 1.4mln bbls, slightly less than expected and well below the API figure, Cushing also posted a chunky 2.3mln bbl draw; in the products, distillates drew more than expected whilst gasoline built more than expected. Elsewhere in the report, production remained at record highs at 12.8mln BPD, refinery utilisation increased by 1.7% (exp. +1.0%), net imports fell to 2.95mln BPD (prev. 3.12mln BPD), where a rise in imports was offset by a larger rise in exports. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Novak said he is not ready to announce his stance on the approaching OPEC+ meeting (Dec 5th/6th), coming after sources reports on Tuesday that Russia is unwilling to make further cuts.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-25+. </strong>The TPLEX was supported on Wednesday by sentiment on the likelihood of a US-China trade deal becoming more pessimistic. The haven asset was already on the front-foot throughout the Asia session, following the pro-democracy HK bill in the US, and then caught a second wind on reports the trade deal was unlikely to be signed this week. The curve continued to bull-flatten with the FOMC minutes confirming a Fed on pause, barring a material worsening of the outlook. The 2s30s flattened by 3bps, with the 30-year yield down 6bps.</p><p><strong>* CANADA CPI:</strong> Consumer prices data for October were largely in line with the consensus view, seeing headline inflation at 0.3% M/M, bouncing back from September's -0.4%; the Y/Y rate was unchanged at 1.9%. The core measures were also in line, rising slightly. An average of the three BOC metrics was unchanged at 2.07%. Looking ahead, RBC's analysts see CPI likely edging higher in the coming months, before slipping back below 2% for much of next year. The bank notes that the near-term rise in energy inflation (weekly gasoline prices now above year-ago levels for the first time in 2019) is not expected to persist, while mortgage interest costs should continue to cool next year. \"Core inflation has been remarkably steady since early-2018, seeing only the most modest of upward trends in 2019, and given strong wage growth in recent months, we'll be watching to see if core measures rise further in 2020.\" However, it notes that with inflation expectations looking well anchored, the scope for stronger underlying inflation looks fairly limited. RBC also says that the BOC cited on-target inflation as one of the key reasons it opted against an 'insurance' rate cut in October; \"the fact that core measures have hovered around 2% for nearly two years allows the BOC to weigh inflation risks 'more symmetrically', and that will leave monetary policy dependent on the growth outlook and trade risks,\" RBC writes, adding \"we think below-trend growth over the second half of this year will leave the door open to a rate cut in early-2020; any disappointment in US-China trade talks (optimism fading a bit as of this morning) would add to the risk of a cut.\"</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> traded firmer throughout the majority of the session however lost some steam around the US cash equity open. DXY pared back some of those losses but again saw further downside as source reports stated a phase one US/China deal may not be completed this year as flows went into havens. DXY traded in a range between 98.04-97.826 and headed into the Asia-Pac session flat. <strong>CNH</strong> was weaker following the 5bps cut to both its 1- and 5-year LPR, whilst also seeing downside on negative US/China source reports.<strong> Havens</strong> were relatively flat to end the day despite initially weakening, but caught some reprieve on the aforementioned source reports, providing a slight bid to JPY and XAU. <strong>CAD</strong> was largely unphased by CPI and continued its weakness following dovish comments from BoC’s Wilkins yesterday. <strong>AUD &amp; NZD</strong> were weaker as it took its cues from risk. <strong>EMFX</strong> also traded generally weaker on Wednesday, with ZAR also being hampered by softer CPI. TRY, however, traded relatively flat against the greenback.</p>",

Minutes will be published on 20th November 2019 at 1900 GMT/1400 ET.</p><p><strong>MEETING REVIEW:</strong> The Fed cut rates by 25bps, as was anticipated. Hawkish dissent came from George and Rosengren again, although Bullard did not repeat his call for a deeper rate cut. The statement saw the Fed tweak its language on future rate moves, now stating it will \"continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,\" (from \"will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\" - a line that the market had taken to meet that the door to further cuts was open); the tweak was subtle, which analysts said gives the Fed optionality on future moves. Additionally, much of the language on the economy was left unchanged: labour markets still remain \"strong\"; growth was rising at a \"moderate rate\"; business fixed investment and exports \"remain weak\"; job gains have been \"solid\"; household spending was rising at a \"strong pace\"; inflation still running below 2%. Analysts took the statement as a signal that the so-called mid-cycle adjustment was over, with the Fed now re-entering data dependency. Powell’s Press conference gave further credence to that view.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FEDSPEAK FROM POWELL, CLARIDA, WILLIAMS:</strong> There has been a heavy slate of Fedspeak post the October FOMC, which could render the minutes somewhat stale. The influential trio of Powell, Clarida and Williams all continued to sound upbeat on the outlook, repeating key messages from the statement, though Powell’s testimonies also noted the moderate level of vulnerabilities in the financial system, while investor appetite for risk was elevated in some asset classes, though the core of the financial sector appeared resilient. He also warned that the high level of US government debt might restrain the ability of fiscal policymakers to support the US economy in the event of a downturn, and that noteworthy risks to the US outlook still remain, with sluggish global growth and trade developments. Vice Chair Clarida has mentioned that immediate Fed policy was unlikely to change, unless the outlook did (Powell and Clarida both think the outlook is currently favourable). Clarida also does not see cracks in the US consumer, stating it has never been in better shape. NY Fed’s Williams has also been positive on the economy; he did, however, note monetary policy should not get involved with the volatility of trade wars and Brexit, and to instead take a longer view.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FEDSPEAK FROM HAWKS AND DOVES: </strong>The dovish contingent – 2019 voter Bullard and 2020 voter Kashkari – also seem to believe rates are appropriate where they are, with the latter seeing conditions as modestly accommodative. Bullard was pleased with the normalisation of the yield curve, saying it could be a bullish sign for 2020. Bullard also spoke about the Fed being able to take back the insurance rate cuts if the economy improved (and only when businesses adjust to the new trade landscape).The hawks were mixed; Rosengren opted to keep rates unchanged at the last meeting as he felt monetary policy was already accommodative, and has expressed concerns of running out of policy room in the event of a negative economic shock. Mester (2020 voter), however, believes current monetary policy is “well calibrated”, and although she would not have opted for a cut, she was sympathetic on the reasoning for one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CURRENT MARKET PRICING:</strong> Money markets currently price 31bps of FOMC easing through the end of next year (i.e. one further cut from current levels). For the December 2019 meeting, markets do not foresee any adjustment to rates. With the Fed now in data dependency, traders will be looking to the minutes for any clues on the conditions that the Fed would need to see to tweak its data-dependent bias, though it seems there is more risk of a dovish rather than a hawkish pivot, if anything. At the post-meeting press conference, Powell himself said that for the Fed to consider hikes, inflation would have to “runaway” from their target (which he does not foresee). UBS believes the minutes will not hold a discussion on the requirements to resume hiking, stating Powell suggested the bar for a hike would be quite high. Others have noted given the lack of upside risks mentioned by Powell, suggests he appears he is leaning more on the dovish side, suggesting a higher barrier for any hikes than for cuts. UBS believes his words would imply there would not be a hike until 2020 at the earliest (current pricing looks for one 25bp cut by the end of 2020). The bank also observes that Powell continues to focus on risks to the economy, though caveats this with commentary about how risks have subsided recently.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STANDING REPO FACILITY/REPO OPERATIONS: </strong>NY Fed President Williams has said that reserves are now at an ample level, noting that the previous levels did affect market liquidity and sensitivity of interest rates. (NOTE: The NY Fed administers the Fed’s money market operations, and as such, Williams is the authority). In order to maintain ample reserves, the Fed has been conducting overnight and termrepo operations. The central bank is also discussing the design and implementation of a Standing Repo Facility, though details are slim and the instrument is yet to be finalised; any details will be welcomed.&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Dollar recoils at the expense of G10s; next up FOMC Minutes",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, CNH</strong></p><p>Another day of gains for the USD and Index with participants citing safe-haven support against the backdrop of souring trade rhetoric. The DXY saw upside overnight after US Senate unanimously passed the Hong Kong bill which backs protestors’ rights and will now head back to the House before landing on President Trump’s desk (refer to the RANsquawk headline feed for further analysis). China strongly condemned the move by Senate and previously warned of retaliation if the bill comes into law. Further upside in the Dollar was exacerbated in early EU hours after China Global Times’ Chief Editor highlighted China’s readiness for a prolonged trade spat, which sent the Index to session high of 98.04, eclipsing its 100 DMA at 98.02. Since then, DXY traded on either side of 98.00 throughout the session and looks poised to end the EU session around mid-range. Meanwhile, CNH looks to end the session on the backfoot and closer to the top of today’s 7.0250-0430 vs the USD, having briefly breached its 100 DMA at 7.0241 earlier in the session, although the pair was little moved by the PBoC expectedly cutting its 1yr and 5yr LPRs by 5bps each in APAC hours. Looking ahead, participants will be eyeing the FOMC Minutes released later today (Full preview available in the RANsquawk Research Suite), whilst tomorrow’s docket looks to be another quiet one, with trade headlines likely to garner the most attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>The high-beta G10 FX continue to be on the backfoot (albeit modestly) heading into the mid-week EU close, amid the aforementioned change in the US-China landscape coupled with USD strength. AUD/USD moved off earlier lows after finding a base at 0.6800 but meanders around its 50 DMA (0.6814) heading into the close but remains below its 100 DMA at 0.6836. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart has climbed off the intraday trough of around 0.6405 and looks to end the EU session around the middle of today’s 0.6405-0.6435 band, still below its 100 DMA at 0.6431. The Loonie meanwhile has shrugged off mostly in-line CPI inflation metrics (money market pricing little swayed) and held onto the losses from yesterday’s dovish BoC member Wilkins. USD/CAD poised to end the EU day sub-1.3300 having traded on either side of the figure (intraday range 1.3262-1.3315). Tomorrow’s session sees little by way of notable events for the antipodeans, but CAD watchers will be on the lookout for the ADP employment figures from the region and BoC Governor Poloz to speak shortly after.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen staged a modest reversal from earlier in the session, albeit more on USD-dynamic than risk. Pertinent news-flow has been light since the start of the European session, in which the Global Times Chief Editor’s tweet ignited a slight bid in safe haven assets. USD/JPY has since climbed back above 108.50 having printed a low of 108.36 in early hours with resistance to the upside including its 21 DMA at 108.75 and Tenkan resistance at 108.86. Looking at downside techs, 108.26-27 coincides with the pair’s 50 DMA and a Fib level. Elsewhere, the Franc has shown more pronounced weakness with no new fundamental news flow to pin to the move on, but SNB action cannot be discounted given recent commentary from Governing Board members. EUR/CHF has taken its 100 DMA and 21 WMA (both at 1.0960) to the upside looks to end the session near intraday highs at 1.0990 (vs. low 1.0950).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling and the Single Currency have largely moved in lockstep to the Buck amid a lack of fresh individual catalysts. Last night’s UK leadership debate provided little new substance whilst the snap YouGov performance poll showed the leaders were more-or-less neck and neck (sample size 1600), and the election survey from the same pollster indicated a slight narrowing in Tory’s lead over Labour. Cable meandered around 1.2900 throughout most of the European session, having visited an intraday base of 1.2889 in early hours vs. an overnight peak of 1.2931. Similarly, EUR/USD trickled lower throughout the day and stopped short of support at 1.1050 ahead of its 21 DMA at 1.1042. The pair was little influenced by comments from ECB VP de Guindos who noted that risks are “not so” tilted to the downside but stated he does not believe the ECB is close to the reversal rate, with the latter symbolic of more room to cut rates if needed. Looking ahead, tomorrow’s docket looks light for UK and EZ, aside from the ECB minutes release which is unlikely to spark fireworks following October’s humdrum meeting.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: US Senate passes Hong Kong Human Rights Bill, how will it affect trade talks?",
        "content": "<p><strong>* THE LATEST: </strong>Last night the US Senate passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require an annual reviews of HK's special status, which could see its special status under US law potentially being withdrawn if the City is not seen to be sufficiently autonomous from mainland China. This follows on from the US House, who passed a similar bill in October. In response, China threatened retaliation, with its Foreign Minister once again urging the US to stop meddling in China's affairs before it is 'too late'. Moving forward, the differences between the two versions of the bill signed in House and Senate need to be reconciled, which will be done when leaders from both chambers meet, before a final version is sent back to the both chambers to be voted on again. Assuming that the final version of the bill passes, as is expected, the bill will go to the President to sign before it goes into law.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP’S OPTIONS: </strong>US President Trump has three could pursue three potential courses of action when the bill hits his desk, notes UBS.</p><p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could sign the bill, but this would likely enrage the Chinese and risk de-railing trade talks.</p><p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could veto the bill. However, if a 2/3 majority vote in Congress could override this veto. Seeing as both chambers have already voted unanimously in favour of the bill, it seems highly likely that any Presidential veto would be overturned.</p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, the President could attempt to pursue a “pocket veto” – i.e. ignoring the bill. Procedurally speaking, the President has 10 days to sign a bill sent by Congress. If on the 10th day Congress is in session, then the bill will become law, and if not, the bill does not become law and is not subject to a congressional vote, essentially meaning the bill has to go back to square one.</p><p>“The best case scenario for markets is that Trump can manoeuvre a pocket veto while congress is not in session, therefore killing the bill without losing face domestically or angering the Chinese during a fraught trade discussion” concludes UBS.</p><p><strong>* THE CURRENT STATE OF NEGOTIATIONS:</strong> Negotiations towards a Phase 1 trade deal are ongoing and most recent commentary is mixed. Last night, US Commerce Secretary Ross said he thinks that there is hope we can get a China deal done and deal is still a work in progress. US President Trump, meanwhile, said he will hike tariffs if they do not make a deal and added 'we'll see what happens' on China trade. Separate reports suggested that the near-deal between the US and China that fell apart six months ago in May is now being used as the benchmark for the sides to decide how much tariffs should be rolled back in the initial phase one trade agreement. Analysts said that the news was positive since it indicates negotiators are discussing methods to roll-back tariffs, which could potentially mean that the levies due to go into effect mid-December might also be cancelled. Other reports, citing sources familiar with the discussions, said a phase 1 trade deal between US-China could turn into something much larger if US President Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs. Regardless of the mixed commentary, the market’s response to developments in the Senate last night are clearly indicative of a fear that talks may be affected, something which CNBC’s Yoon this morning played down. Citing Chinese academics in Hong Kong, she said that China nor the US will want to link the US Senate's recently passed Hong Kong Human Rights bill to current trade talks. Moreover, the academics think that US President Trump will not use the Hong Kong bill as a bargaining chip as he is “unconcerned with ideology”, rather he wants a deal for his re-election campaign. However, many are cynical that Chinese government would be willing to separate the issues of trade talks and US political interference in Hong Kong, especially as these comments came from academics rather than policy makers. Elsewhere, China’s Global Times Editor this morning struck a more negative tone, saying that few on the Chinese side believe that China and the US can achieve a trade deal soon, given poor “China policy” from US. He added that the belief is that the significance of a potential deal will be limited, and China is prepared for a prolonged trade war.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.8%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) </strong>conformed to the subdued picture following China’s stern response to the US Senate’s passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights Bill, in which it called on the US to stop interfering in its affairs and suggested that it must take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security. However, losses in the mainland were somewhat limited by optimistic comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross that they still think there's hope a China deal can be done and following the PBoC’s 5bps reduction to its Loan Prime Rates. Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the gains in T-notes and was spurred by safe-haven demand following China’s retaliation threat, while the 20yr JGB auction was inconclusive as the results showed stronger demand at lower accepted prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Downside has extended during European trade, with negative comments from China’s Global Times Editor Hu Xijin only exacerbating things. In terms of the sectors, Energy (-1.6%) is the laggard, as yesterday’s steep decline weighs. Other more risk sensitive sectors including Consumer Discretionary (-1.0%), Tech (-0.5%) and Financials (-1.3%) are also suffering, while defensive sectors are holding up better. Moving on to the most notable stock specific movers; Nexi (+3.1%) tops the Stoxx 600 table, with the news that it is in preliminary talks with Intesa Sanpaolo (-0.4%) regarding a possible commercial partnership supportive. Moreover, positive broker moves for Novozymes (+2.5%) and ADP (+1.5%) from Citigroup and RBC respectively saw their shares move higher. In terms of the laggards; Kingfisher (-6.7%) sunk after downbeat earnings, in which the Co. noted there is clearly much to be done to improve performance and that they had not found the correct balance between group scale benefits and local market. Sage Group (-3.6%) is lower after underlying operating profit and EPS fell, although the Co. did increase its FY dividend. Swedbank (-3.8%) shares are lower, with US authorities investigating the Co’s Baltic unit to determine if transactions violated US sanctions on Russia; the Co.’s CEO said he was not aware of any violations and internal investigations to be concluded early next year. Elsewhere amongst the laggards are Wirecard (-2.8%); auditors at EY have reportedly refused to approve Co’s 2017 Singapore accounts, reported Handelsblatt citing documents.</p><p><strong>Lowe's Companies Inc (LOW)</strong> Q3 19 (USD): adj.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong> - The broad Dollar and Index gains traction in early European trade amid underlying safe-haven support given the bleaker rhetoric out of China regarding an imminent Phase One deal and potential complications from the US Hong Kong bill. On trade, Global Time’s Chief Editor highlighted China’s readiness for a prolonged trade spat, aiding the DXY to test 98.00 to the upside (vs. an overnight low of ~97.80) shortly after the cash open and eclipse its 100 DMA (98.02) before stabilising below the round figure. Meanwhile, China condemned the US bill supporting Hong Kong protesters which was unanimously passed in Senate and makes way to the House for a re-vote, with some wondering whether this could be another wedge in trade talks despite the official previously highlighting the issues are separate. USD/CNH sees renewed upside in early hours (after little move on the expected PBoC LPR cut) with the pair now above its 21 and 100 DMAs (7.0288 and 7.0411) and at the top of its current 7.0250-0430 intraday range.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD - </strong>All moving in-line with the current trade-induced risk aversion. The non-US Dollars are all pressured in wake of the aforementioned pilling of bearish-sentiment factors which dwindle the prospect of a long-lasting truce between the two nations. AUD/USD reversed a bulk of yesterday’s gains and retested 0.6800 to the downside at one point, currently residing just off the lower bound of today’s 0.6800-30 parameter. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart fell below its 100 DMA (0.6432) in overnight trade following China’s condemnation of US Senate’s action and tested support at 0.6400 (vs. high of 0.6435). The Loonie meanwhile bears the brunt of softer energy prices but looks forwards to the Canadian CPI metrics with the headline YY remaining steady at 1.9%. USD/CAD took out its 200 DMA (1.3275) in early EU hours as it takes a stab at 1.3300 to the upside.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF -</strong> Supported by their safe-haven statuses as the trade landscape shifts away from the recent hopefulness. USD/JPY meanders a touch below the 108.50 mark ahead of a Fib level and its 50 DMA both at 108.26 whilst notable option expiries include USD 1bln at strikes 108.50-65. Correspondingly, the Franc sees modest gains with EUR/CHF back under its 100 DMA and 21 DMAs both at 1.0960.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR -</strong> Both modestly softer and largely at the whim of a firming Buck. Last night’s UK leadership debate provided little by way of new substance, whilst a YouGov snap poll on performance (1600 respondents) showed the leaders more-or-less neck and neck, and the election survey from the same pollster indicated a slight narrowing in Tory’s lead over Labour. GBP/USD hovers around a 38.2.% Fib level just above 1.2900 having dipped below the figure earlier on a firmer Buck. EUR/USD losses more ground below its 100 DMA (1.1089) but found a base at 1.1060 ahead of its 21 DMA at 1.1042.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.1000-05 (1.1BLN), <strong>1.1045-55 (700M), 1.1100-15 (1BLN)</strong></p><p>- AUD/USD: 0.6825 (200M), <strong>0.6845-50 (700M),</strong> 0.6940 (1.4BLN)</p><p>- USD/JPY: 108.00 (410M), 108.20-30 (700M), <strong>108.50-65 (1-BLN),</strong> 108.75 (250M)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Debt is boosted this morning in a mid-week turnaround from the first two lacklustre sessions for the complex; although, the day’s calendar is once again relatively light so focus will remain on US and China trade and Hong Kong tensions. <strong>Bunds</strong> are in proximity to the top-end of the sessions range, deriving support from aforementioned updates, with a high of 171.56 printed at best thus far, ahead of this from a technical perspective the way is clear until the psychological 172.0 mark in the event a catalyst presents itself.

Downside has extended during European trade, with negative comments from China’s Global Times Editor Hu Xijin only exacerbating things. In terms of the sectors, Energy (-1.6%) is the laggard, as yesterday’s steep decline weighs. Other more risk sensitive sectors including Consumer Discretionary (-1.0%), Tech (-0.5%) and Financials (-1.3%) are also suffering, while defensive sectors are holding up better. Moving on to the most notable stock specific movers; Nexi (+3.1%) tops the Stoxx 600 table, with the news that it is in preliminary talks with Intesa Sanpaolo (-0.4%) regarding a possible commercial partnership supportive. Moreover, positive broker moves for Novozymes (+2.5%) and ADP (+1.5%) from Citigroup and RBC respectively saw their shares move higher. In terms of the laggards; Kingfisher (-6.7%) sunk after downbeat earnings, in which the Co. noted there is clearly much to be done to improve performance and that they had not found the correct balance between group scale benefits and local market. Sage Group (-3.6%) is lower after underlying operating profit and EPS fell, although the Co. did increase its FY dividend. Swedbank (-3.8%) shares are lower, with US authorities investigating the Co’s Baltic unit to determine if transactions violated US sanctions on Russia; the Co.’s CEO said he was not aware of any violations and internal investigations to be concluded early next year. Elsewhere amongst the laggards are Wirecard (-2.8%); auditors at EY have reportedly refused to approve Co’s 2017 Singapore accounts, reported Handelsblatt citing documents.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong> - The broad Dollar and Index gains traction in early European trade amid underlying safe-haven support given the bleaker rhetoric out of China regarding an imminent Phase One deal and potential complications from the US Hong Kong bill. On trade, Global Time’s Chief Editor highlighted China’s readiness for a prolonged trade spat, aiding the DXY to test 98.00 to the upside (vs. an overnight low of ~97.80) shortly after the cash open and eclipse its 100 DMA (98.02) before stabilising below the round figure. Meanwhile, China condemned the US bill supporting Hong Kong protesters which was unanimously passed in Senate and makes way to the House for a re-vote, with some wondering whether this could be another wedge in trade talks despite the official previously highlighting the issues are separate. USD/CNH sees renewed upside in early hours (after little move on the expected PBoC LPR cut) with the pair now above its 21 and 100 DMAs (7.0288 and 7.0411) and at the top of its current 7.0250-0430 intraday range.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong> - All moving in-line with the current trade-induced risk aversion. The non-US Dollars are all pressured in wake of the aforementioned pilling of bearish-sentiment factors which dwindle the prospect of a long-lasting truce between the two nations. AUD/USD reversed a bulk of yesterday’s gains and retested 0.6800 to the downside at one point, currently residing just off the lower bound of today’s 0.6800-30 parameter. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart fell below its 100 DMA (0.6432) in overnight trade following China’s condemnation of US Senate’s action and tested support at 0.6400 (vs. high of 0.6435). The Loonie meanwhile bears the brunt of softer energy prices but looks forwards to the Canadian CPI metrics with the headline YY remaining steady at 1.9%. USD/CAD took out its 200 DMA (1.3275) in early EU hours as it takes a stab at 1.3300 to the upside.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong> - Supported by their safe-haven statuses as the trade landscape shifts away from the recent hopefulness. USD/JPY meanders a touch below the 108.50 mark ahead of a Fib level and its 50 DMA both at 108.26 whilst notable option expiries include USD 1bln at strikes 108.50-65. Correspondingly, the Franc sees modest gains with EUR/CHF back under its 100 DMA and 21 DMAs both at 1.0960.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong> - Both modestly softer and largely at the whim of a firming Buck. Last night’s UK leadership debate provided little by way of new substance, whilst a YouGov snap poll on performance (1600 respondents) showed the leaders more-or-less neck and neck, and the election survey from the same pollster indicated a slight narrowing in Tory’s lead over Labour. GBP/USD hovers around a 38.2.% Fib level just above 1.2900 having dipped below the figure earlier on a firmer Buck. EUR/USD losses more ground below its 100 DMA (1.1089) but found a base at 1.1060 ahead of its 21 DMA at 1.1042.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Debt is boosted this morning in a mid-week turnaround from the first two lacklustre sessions for the complex; although, the day’s calendar is once again relatively light so focus will remain on US and China trade and Hong Kong tensions. <strong>Bunds</strong> are in proximity to the top-end of the sessions range, deriving support from aforementioned updates, with a high of 171.56 printed at best thus far, ahead of this from a technical perspective the way is clear until the psychological 172.0 mark in the event a catalyst presents itself. Elsewhere, the remainder of the fixed income complex is benefitting from the overnight updates with no clear debt underperformer at present; illustrated by both core and periphery bonds firmer by a similar magnitude. Note, <strong>Gilts</strong> are similarly supported and do not appear to have been significantly moved following yesterday’s leaders’ debate, which snap polling indicated was roughly a draw. Finally, <strong>USTs</strong> are in-line with European counterparts though upside in the 10-year has been capped by the 50-DMA at 129.29 thus far; for reference, the curve itself is continuing to flatten today.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude futures are relatively flat following a mammoth sell-off in the prior session where anti-production cut commentary out of Russia and bearish supply updates in Europe saw the complex sell off.

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index gains traction in early European trade amid underlying safe-haven support given the bleaker rhetoric out of China regarding an imminent Phase One deal and potential complications from the US Hong Kong bill. On trade, Global Time’s Chief Editor highlighted China’s readiness for a prolonged trade spat, aiding the DXY to test 98.00 to the upside (vs. an overnight low of ~97.80) shortly after the cash open and eclipse its 100 DMA (98.02) before stabilising below the round figure. Meanwhile, China condemned the US bill supporting Hong Kong protesters which was unanimously passed in Senate and makes way to the House for a re-vote, with some wondering whether this could be another wedge in trade talks despite the official previously highlighting the issues are separate. USD/CNH sees renewed upside in early hours (after little move on the expected PBoC LPR cut) with the pair now above its 21 and 100 DMAs (7.0288 and 7.0411) and at the top of its current 7.0250-0430 intraday range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>All moving in-line with the current trade-induced risk aversion. The non-US Dollars are all pressured in wake of the aforementioned pilling of bearish-sentiment factors which dwindle the prospect of a long-lasting truce between the two nations. AUD/USD reversed a bulk of yesterday’s gains and retested 0.6800 to the downside at one point, currently residing just off the lower bound of today’s 0.6800-30 parameter. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart fell below its 100 DMA (0.6432) in overnight trade following China’s condemnation of US Senate’s action and tested support at 0.6400 (vs. high of 0.6435). The Loonie meanwhile bears the brunt of softer energy prices but looks forwards to the Canadian CPI metrics with the headline YY remaining steady at 1.9%. USD/CAD took out its 200 DMA (1.3275) in early EU hours as it takes a stab at 1.3300 to the upside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Supported by their safe-haven statuses as the trade landscape shifts away from the recent hopefulness. USD/JPY meanders a touch below the 108.50 mark ahead of a Fib level and its 50 DMA both at 108.26 whilst notable option expiries include USD 1bln at strikes 108.50-65. Correspondingly, the Franc sees modest gains with EUR/CHF back under its 100 DMA and 21 DMAs both at 1.0960.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Both modestly softer and largely at the whim of a firming Buck. Last night’s UK leadership debate provided little by way of new substance, whilst a YouGov snap poll on performance (1600 respondents) showed the leaders more-or-less neck and neck, and the election survey from the same pollster indicated a slight narrowing in Tory’s lead over Labour. GBP/USD hovers around a 38.2.% Fib level just above 1.2900 having dipped below the figure earlier on a firmer Buck. EUR/USD losses more ground below its 100 DMA (1.1089) but found a base at 1.1060 ahead of its 21 DMA at 1.1042.&nbsp;</p>",

Overnight saw mixed reports on the trade front alongside the US Senate approving the Hong Kong Human Rights bill which has returned to the House for approval, sparking significant backlash and condemnation from China. Bunds are in proximity to the top-end of the sessions range, deriving support from aforementioned updates, with a high of 171.56 printed at best thus far, ahead of this from a technical perspective the way is clear until the psychological 172.0 mark in the event a catalyst presents itself. Elsewhere, the remainder of the fixed income complex is benefitting from the overnight updates with no clear debt underperformer at present; illustrated by both core and periphery bonds firmer by a similar magnitude. Note, Gilts are similarly supported and do not appear to have been significantly moved following yesterday’s leaders’ debate, which snap polling indicated was roughly a draw. Finally, USTs are in-line with European counterparts though upside in the 10-year has been capped by the 50-DMA at 129.29 thus far; for reference, the curve itself is continuing to flatten today.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower as investor sentiment continues to hang on the US-China trade uncertainty and after the US Senate unanimously passed the legislation aimed at supporting Hong Kong protests which was met by condemnation from China and spurred concerns of a derailment in trade talks. ASX 200 (-1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) are both negative with Australia pressured by losses in its largest weighted financials sector after Westpac was accused by AUSTRAC of 23mln breaches related to anti-money laundering, while the weakness in Japan is a function of the JPY-risk dynamic, tumultuous trade headlines and disappointing data including a larger than expected contraction in the nation’s Exports. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) conform to the subdued picture following China’s stern response to the US Senate’s passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights Bill in which it called on the US to stop interfering in its affairs and suggested that it must take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security. Nonetheless, losses in the mainland are limited by optimistic comments from US Commerce Secretary Ross that they still think there's hope a China deal can be done and following the PBoC’s 5bps reduction to its Loan Prime Rates.</p><p>In FX markets, the downbeat risk tone has been the main driving force for the hard currencies with the DXY benefitting from a mild safe-haven bid as it makes its way back towards the 98.00 level amid the US-China trade concerns, which also pressured CNH. The greenback’s major counterparts are lacklustre as EUR/USD is stuck in a tight range with several key DMA levels in close proximity and GBP/USD is also subdued following the recent pullback to briefly test support at 1.2900 as the latest polls point to a varied picture regarding the extent of the Conservatives’ lead and with the leadership debate not providing much to shift the status quo as a survey suggested 51% thought PM Johnson won the debate vs. 49% for Labour leader Corbyn. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were briefly rattled by the trade concerns and China’s stern response to the US, which also dampened antipodeans due to their high-beta statuses and China exposure, while a recent note from Macquarie suggested that an easing bias for the RBA remains in place and that even the outside threat of unconventional policy should restrict gains in the currency.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid similar gains in T-notes and spurred by safe-haven demand following China retaliation threat, while focus now shifts to the looming 20yr JGB auction.</p>",
