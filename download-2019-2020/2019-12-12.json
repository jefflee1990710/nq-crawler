Even with a margin of error of around 15 seats, this would stand the Conservatives well clear of the 326 required to govern. As such, focus now turns towards what this means for Boris Johnson and the Brexit Process. Given that Johnson stated that all Conservative candidates had agreed to approve the withdrawal agreement in the HoC, the passage of the bill is all but certain. This is the main driving force behind the significant GBP strength which has GBP/USD rise from mid 1.31 to a high thus far of 1.3477; the highest since June 2018. What lies ahead? As we mentioned in our commentary, focus will thereafter turn towards the transition period to with the EU which is due to expire in December 2020. A decision on whether to extend this is due at the end of June. However, Johnson has backed himself into a corner by stating he would not extend the transition period and therefore in theory, the possibility of a cliff-edge exit is still live. When this becomes the source of focus for the market is yet to be seen. However, from a policy perspective, the possibility of a BoE rate hike could be back on the menu as the fog of uncertainty provided by Brexit dissipates... for now.&nbsp;</p>",

The news sent the S&amp;P and Nasdaq to fresh record highs where the S&amp;P initially hit 3176 ,while WSJ report also helped with the rally as it cited sources, saying the US negotiators are offering to cut the existing tariff rates by up to 50% on USD 360bln of Chinese imports and offering to cancel the new Dec. 15th tariffs, while it was later reported that both US and Chinese negotiators have reached the terms of a Phase one deal, with an announcement could be coming as soon as this afternoon, although the legal text still has to be finalized. The combined news saw a classic risk on move which saw 10-year yields breach 1.92 to the upside. USDCNH collapsed through the 7.00 handle and remained there throughout the rest of the session. Facebook (FB) shares dipped lower in late trade, as did the Nasdaq-100, after the WSJ reported the FTC is seeking an injunction against it as soon as January on antitrust concerns. Boeing (BA) traded in the red after reports that the FAA are concerned about its unrealistic expectations for a safe return of the 737 MAX jet, thus noting it is not likely to get FAA approval until February, further delaying the return of the jet. Lululemon (LULU) traded lower despite a strong quarterly report, after its Q4 guidance disappointed. Delta Air Lines (DAL) gave its 2020 profit forecast above analyst expectations, seeing the stock outperform. Semiconductors (SOX) were bid on the positive China trade developments, although pared somewhat. Albemarle (ALB) was supported amid it providing an upbeat lithium demand forecast. Apple (AAPL) opened lower and was a net drag on indices after Credit Suisse cited data showing persistent weak shipments in the key China region. Financials (XLF) were bid on the back of the higher yields and steeper curve, particularly on the other side of the pond as new ECB President Lagarde alluded to more bank supportive policy. General Electric (GE) was bid after UBS’ new analyst assumed coverage at a Buy from Neutral, citing a “positive inflection point”. S&amp;P 0.85% at 3168, NDX +0.73% at 8717, DJ +0.8% at 28,132.</p><p>The TPLEX sold off sharply on Trump’s tweet of a “big deal” in China, in addition to the WSJ reporting existing tariffs would be slashed, as part of a cross-asset risk on move, although saw a late session leg lower on reports a Phase One deal was ready to be signed off on, with Trump’s signature being awaited on, although participants are still waiting for absolute confirmation of a deal and that Sunday’s tariffs will be delayed. The attractive yields brought stellar demand to the US 30-year bond reopening auction, with a high yield of 2.307%, the auction was covered 2.46x (firmly above the average 2.23x), stopping through the WI by 2.1bps, a rare occurrence in the long bond. The takedown was just as promising, with dealers taking just 15.5%, 10ppts beneath the average, seeing both directs and indirects take above average; the auction saw a fleeting bid in the 30-year bond as the wider risk appetite prevailed. US T-note (H0) futures settle 28+ ticks lower at 128-12+.</p>",

The news sent the S&amp;P and Nasdaq to fresh record highs where the S&amp;P initially hit 3176. Although reports in WSJ also helped with the rally as it cited sources, saying the US negotiators are offering to cut the existing tariff rates by up to 50% on USD 360bln of Chinese imports, whilst also offering to cancel the new Dec. 15th tariffs. The combined news saw a classic risk on move which saw 10-year yields breach 1.92 to the upside. USDCNH collapsed through the 7.00 handle and remained there throughout the rest of the session. It is worth noting throughout the middle part of the session, US Equities pared back a lot of the move with the S&amp;P approaching the 3150 handle, however XAU and T-notes remained just off session lows. In the tail end of the session however, as Trump’s meeting went underway with the primary trade team and US CEO’s, it was reported an agreement in principle had been reached with China, although Trump is yet to sign off on the deal, which saw a further typical risk on move, although predominantly in equities and USDCNH. CNH continued to strengthen pushing USDCNH to lows sub 6.95, a level not seen since July. Aside from China, the ECB stood pat as expected whilst President Lagarde stuck to the script as she announced her strategic review will begin in January and should be completed before the end of 2020. Lagarde also announced herself as neither a hawk nor dove, but instead an “owl”, which some desks interpreted as a potential boost for EU banks. Next up participants will be eyeing the UK election results, further clarity on the US China agreement and earnings from ADBE, ORCL, AVGO and COST.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>The US reportedly reached a deal in principle with China amid President Trump’s meeting with the primary trade team in the US and multiple US CEO’s. The report offered little details, however an official announcement could come as soon as tonight as the legal text still has to be finalised. Earlier in the session US President Trump kicked off the day by tweeting they are getting “VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China”, adding both sides want a deal. The WSJ followed with source reports US negotiators are offering to cut the existing tariff rates by up to 50% on USD 360bln of Chinese imports, whilst also offering to cancel the new Dec. 15th tariffs. CNBC’s Yoon added that her sources close to trade talks told her that the WSJ report was true, although one source added the snapback is two-way, so the Chinese would also have the right to reimpose tariffs. Further, CNBC’s Tausche reported that the concessions reportedly on offer were actually offered over a week ago. Prior to this, US Ags. Sec. Perdue stated China did commit to purchase up to USD 50bln in agricultural products, however they would not commit to it in a contract. The WSJ report did state that the US is asking for a firm commitment on increased US products, whilst also noting that if China fails to carry out its pledges it would reimpose the original tariffs. The China response has only come from multiple global times reports, who stated if the reports are true, they are welcomed, but to end the trade war, persistent efforts are needed by both sides with movement to removing all additional tariffs and that real progress could not count unless a final agreement is signed. CNBC’s Tausche on the signing however noted it is unclear whether signing will be today but the fact that it would be signed at all makes it a more formalized deal than had been announced in the past; although other reports note an announcement could come later on tonight.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Rates were unchanged, in line with expectations, and the ECB's policy statement was also little changed. New ECB President Lagarde provided a balanced assessment, largely sticking to the ECB's script; but there were a few interesting remarks. Lagarde noted that while risks remained tilted to the downside, they were somewhat less pronounced given the stabilisation in data. Analysts also said she did a good job of assuring markets that the ECB was not on the cusp of a hawkish tilt. While she is pleased that inflation is moving in the right direction (noting that in Q4 2022, HICP is forecast to be sitting at 1.7%), she seemed displeased that it was not at target. She also appeared to suggest that the central bank's mandate will not be changing from price stability but is very aware of the side effects of negative rates, which she said was a 'preoccupation'. Crucially, Lagarde was asked about the reversal rate (the point at which expansionary policy becomes contractionary), and she did not believe that the ECB was near it yet, noting also that Europe was not near Japanification. Lagarde was again asked about her policy stance, batting away the question by suggesting she was neither a hawk nor a dove, and she wanted to be an 'owl', which desks were noting as a strength for EU banks. Lagarde was asked about unity on the Governing Council, and she said that she was aiming for decisions to be as consensual as possible, in line with reports heading into the confab, and she also talked up the benefits of forward guidance. Elsewhere, Lagarde was happy trade talks were progressing in the right direction. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/ecb-forecasts-12-12-2019\">Click here for the latest economic forecasts.</a></p><p><strong>* CHINA GROWTH: </strong>Source reports in Nikkei stated that China is looking to set its new economic growth target at “around 6%” in 2020, lower than 2019’s target of 6-6.55%. The move follows the pressure on the nation given the ongoing US China Trade war.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLES USD 0.42 HIGHER AT USD 59.18/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.48 HIGHER AT USD 64.20/BBL. </strong>Crude<strong> </strong>benchmarks danced to the tune of promising US-China trade updates, legging higher on reports the US could slash tariffs on China. Elsewhere, the IEA forecasting a supply surplus in Q2 2020 did little to persuade sellers into the market – analysts at Citi note that, “even if we blend in the less bearish DOE and OPEC forecasts, we still see a 1Q surplus on the order of 0.3mln-0.4mln BPD.” Close to settlement, benchmarks found some mild selling pressure on the back of the WSJ reporting Saudi was looking to ease tensions with Iran, reducing some of the geopolitical risk premium baked into the crude complex.</p><p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>Maintains global oil demand growth views for 2019 and 2020 at 1mln and 1.2mln BPD, respectively. OECD oil demand set to fall by 75k BPD in 2019 – first annual decline since 2014. Projected OPEC output is still 700k BPD above Q2 2020 demand for its crude and 1mln BPD above Q2 demand; OPEC set to pump around 29.3mln BPD in January based on full compliance to new pact. Global supply held steady as rising US, North Sea and Canada output was countered by Saudi cuts. Even if OPEC+ strictly follows the pact, only 530k BPD of crude would be withdrawn from the market vs. November. Regarding demand growth view changes, The IEA report aligns itself more with the OPEC report as they both kept global demand growth forecasts unchanged for 2019 and 2020, whilst EIA saw a modest revision higher of 50k BPD to its 2020 forecast; however, the IEA does forecast a supply surplus, unlike the OPEC and EIA report.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 0.85% at 3168, NDX +0.73% at 8717, DJ +0.8% at 28,132</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Facebook (FB) shares dipped lower in late trade, as did the Nasdaq-100, after the WSJ reported the FTC is seeking an injunction against it as soon as January on antitrust concerns. Boeing (BA) traded in the red after reports that the FAA are concerned about its unrealistic expectations for a safe return of the 737 MAX jet, thus noting it is not likely to get FAA approval until February, further delaying the return of the jet. Lululemon (LULU) traded lower despite a strong quarterly report, after its Q4 guidance disappointed. Delta Air Lines (DAL) gave its 2020 profit forecast above analyst expectations, seeing the stock outperform. Semiconductors (SOX) were bid on the positive China trade developments, although pared somewhat. Albemarle (ALB) was supported amid it providing an upbeat lithium demand forecast. Apple (AAPL) opened lower and was a net drag on indices after Credit Suisse cited data showing persistent weak shipments in the key China region. Financials (XLF) were bid on the back of the higher yields and steeper curve, particularly on the other side of the pond as new ECB President Lagarde alluded to more bank supportive policy. General Electric (GE) was bid after UBS’ new analyst assumed coverage at a Buy from Neutral, citing a “positive inflection point”. Starbucks (SBUX) also benefitted from an upgrade, with JPMorgan pleased after meeting its management. Nordson (NDSN) traded in the red after the industrial equipment name posted a revenue miss. Energy stocks (XOP, XLE) were supported by the stronger crude oil prices, spurred by the positive China trade developments. PerkinElmer (PKI) was boosted on an FDA authorization.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLE 28+ TICKS LOWER AT 128-12+. </strong>The TPLEX sold off sharply on Trump’s tweet of a “big deal” in China, in addition to the WSJ reporting existing tariffs would be slashed, as part of a cross-asset risk on move, although saw a late session leg lower on reports a Phase One deal was ready to be signed off on, with Trump’s signature being awaited on, although participants are still waiting for absolute confirmation of a deal and that Sunday’s tariffs will be delayed. The attractive yields brought stellar demand to the US 30-year bond reopening auction, with a high yield of 2.307%, the auction was covered 2.46x (firmly above the average 2.23x), stopping through the WI by 2.1bps, a rare occurrence in the long bond. The takedown was just as promising, with dealers taking just 15.5%, 10ppts beneath the average, seeing both directs and indirects take above average; the auction saw a fleeting bid in the 30-year bond as the wider risk appetite prevailed.</p><p><strong>* FED OPERATIONS:</strong> The NY Fed announced its T-Bill purchases will remain at USD 60bln for the next month, whilst also announcing it will be increasing its overnight offering to USD 150bln from 120bln on December 31st and January 2nd 2020. The Fed also set 10 term-repo operations over the next month, starting with a 32 day auction on Monday 16th whilst increasing the limit to USD 50bln from USD 25bln. NOTE: The previous term repo operations have been over-subscribed.</p><p><strong>* BOC’S POLOZ: </strong>BoC's Poloz said the bank doesn’t want to put a lot of weight on individual data points, especially labour data – in response to the recent weak jobs report – adding that the overall trend has been positive. Furthermore, when asked about an insurance cut if the jobs data falls for a third month, he said he would not just look at employment, instead would look at other indicators as the labour market tends to lag. Poloz also said the bank is seeing a bottoming out of most indicators in the global economy, inflation on target suggesting the BoC has done its job, whilst adding the side effects of low rates are not it's prime mission.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: CNH</strong> strengthened against the buck today following a slew of positive US China headlines, with the latest being that the US and China have agreed to an agreement in principle. USDCNH fell to lows not seen since July as it crossed 6.95 to the downside. <strong>USD </strong>traded firmer today driven by an outflow of havens which drove the Dollar Index above 97.50 briefly from lows of 97.03, however some of the gains in the greenback have pared. <strong>Havens</strong> were all weaker on the day, with USDJPY breaching 109 to the upside to see highs of 109.44 and trades around the 1.30 mark heading into the overnight session. XAU shed about 20 bucks falling from 1486 to 1465 as the precious metal was weighed on given its haven characteristics. CHF was weaker against EUR, USD and GBP. <strong>GBP </strong>initially sold off as participants await tonight’s election. Cable initially crossed 1.31 to the downside amid dollar strength however a reversal was seen in the tail end of the session as UK journalist reports suggested the Conservatives are doing better than expected in Leave voting Labour marginals which put Cable back to 1.3150. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally bid against the buck today given the risk on feel to markets. The Real traded firmer, despite a 50bp cut and failing to signal an end of easing. TRY also buoyed, despite a 200bp cut, to its repo rate as it signalled inflation is on track to its target path, a sign of health to the Turkish economy. ZAR an outperformer as it’s state owned Eskom announced Stage 1 of loadshedding, signalling a sign of ease from the previous day complexities.</p><p><strong>* SNB: </strong>SNB left rates unchanged at -0.75%; additionally, its classification of the CHF was retained as ‘highly valued’. Most notably from the policy announcement the SNB sees the rate at -0.75% for the entirety of the forecast horizon which underpins inflation projections, and as such can be interpreted as a push back on the very limited pricing for a cut at this meeting. In terms of forecasts, 2019 growth was upgraded to 1.0% from the 0.5-1.0% forecast in September and the inflation outlook for 2020 and 2021 were both downgraded by 0.1bp to 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Overall, the meeting was relatively uneventful and was not sufficient to prompt a significant move in EUR/CHF; note, today’s outlook for the CHF was likely more fixated on the day’s key risk events in the form of Lagarde’s first ECB meeting and the UK General Election.</p><p><strong>* CBRT: </strong>The Turkish Central Bank opted for a deeper 200bps cut to its Repo Rate -- against expectations for a 150bps reduction -- taking its key rate down to 12.00%. The central bank reaffirmed its commitment to sustained disinflation in order to aid with sovereign risk reduction, decrease long-term interest rates and support the recovery in the Turkish economy. Further, the CBRT maintained its 'cautious' stance, and noted that forecasts indicated that inflation was likely to materialise close to the lower bound of the October inflation reports projections -- thus alluding to a normalising economy following the Lira crisis back in August 2018. Finally, the central bank also left key guidance unchanged; \"at this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path\". Analysts at ING note that the CBRT has become more confident, given the improvement in inflation dynamics. That said, inflation readings with a less supportive base and low real policy rates could prompt it to turn more cautious in the near-term, ING concludes.</p><p><strong>* BCB: </strong>The BCB cut its policy rate by 50bps, as was forecast by analysts, taking the Selic rate to 4.50%. However, the statement did not signal the end of the easing cycle, which many analysts were expecting. The statement was judged as dovish, as a result, highlighting the recovery has gathered momentum since Q2, acknowledging that external conditions are stabilising. Additionally, the statement dropped the previous reference to the risks to emerging markets and global economy. On inflation, the central bank noted that several underlying inflation measures are still \"running at comfortable levels\" although risks remain, while the statement also removed the prior reference to downside risks related to inertia; the statement did, however, continued to argue that the high level of economic slack is the main downside threat. The Board said that its next steps will be data dependent, and that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy. \"Overall,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics says, \"the Bank is now near-term cautiously dovish, supporting our base case of an additional rate cut in February,\" but PM says it still cannot rule out rates remaining on hold, as the economic recovery is strengthening and the BRL has been under strain recently. \"Looking further ahead, rates likely will remain steady throughout the year, in line with the Board's hawkish tilt for its next steps.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This suggests a return to more robust bidding from overseas which should help today’s auction,\" BMO says, noting that spec positioning in the ultra-long contract has once again reached record short territory, as yields have continue to oscillate in the new lower range. \"Such one sided sentiment introduces the potential for a short squeeze and could exacerbate at outsized rally in the long end.\" Additionally, cumulative monthly flows in the long duration ETF has been volatile, BMO writes, but now are solidly positive which is a good momentum signal. BMO adds that, seasonally, December is a good month for the long bond at auction as six of the last ten have stopped through and four have tailed. On the other side of the coin, yesterday's on hold policy decision and Powell’s press conference taking immediate future easing off the table failed to trigger any risk-off market response. \"This speaks to some underlying optimism that 2020 will be the year of the soft landing and all else equal could still offer some bearish pressure over the next few months,\" BMO says, \"5s30s has remained in its range for the past few months as the steepening we saw into the summer has been partially unwound, this detracts from the incentive to extend duration, and the Fed is not buying anything via SOMA add on today, and while 30s are slightly rich in repo this should not meaningfully alter auction demand.\"</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 2.43%, six-auction avg. 2.409%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.6bps, six-auction avg. 0.9bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.23x, six-auction avg. 2.23x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 20.7%, six-auction avg. 25.6%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 20.5%, six-auction avg. 16.1%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 58.8%, six-auction avg. 58.3%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar was still licking post-Fed wounds and the index looked in danger of retesting the resolve and psychological will of bids/support at the 97.000 level before a tweet from President Trump not long after the Wall Street open prompted a sharp upturn in risk sentiment to the detriment of safe-havens and benefit of risk assets, as he claimed that Washington and Beijing are on the brink of a major trade deal (Phase 1 presumably). The DXY and high betas then got an additional boost via a WSJ article citing sources saying that US trade negotiators are offering to halve tariffs on Usd360 bn Chinese imports and perhaps most importantly cancel (not just roll) those still scheduled to be imposed on December 15. The index hit a new recovery high at 97.353 even though the <strong>CNH </strong>rebounded further from circa 7.0400 through 6.9700 at best.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No shock to see the Aussie extend gains and outperformance in the major ranks on the aforementioned breaking US-China news, with Aud/Usd eclipsing 0.6900 and Aud/Nzd surpassing 1.0475 as the Kiwi continued to encounter resistance ahead of 0.6500.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>In stark contrast, but also unsurprisingly the Yen and Franc were among the biggest losers as risk appetite picked up, with Usd/Jpy breaking out of recent ranges and over 109.00, Usd/Chf up above 0.9860 at one stage and Eur/Chf rebounding from 1.0924 to around 1.0970 after only modest moves (Franc weakness) on the latest SNB commitments to negative rates and active/direct FX intervention to ensure that a still highly valued Chf does not appreciate too much. Meanwhile, the Pound maintained a watching brief and vigil pending the UK election outcome as a late poll shaved the Tory advantage over Labour to 11 pp and spread better odds on a Conservative majority fell amidst reports that young British voters (typically anti-Tory) were turning out in force. Cable currently some 100 pips off 1.3200+ peaks and Eur/Gbp closer to 0.8500 than 0.8420 awaiting the first exit polls after 22.00GMT and an action packed night keeping track of constituency results with attention on the so called swing seats.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>The single currency was volatile before all the US-China related headlines as new ECB President Lagarde delivered her first post-policy meet presser and appeared to be a bit more encouraged about recent activity indicators, but less so on the inflation outlook, while declaring herself as an owl rather than hawk or dove during the Q&amp;A. Eur/Usd got extremely close to the 200 DMA (1.1155) before paring all the way back to sub-1.1120, while the Loonie has also unwound some gains vs its US rival between 1.3197-62 parameters pending rhetoric from BoC’s Poloz later.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona welcomed the risk rally that also lifted oil prices, but its Swedish peer remained hampered by poor jobs metrics even though the rise in unemployment rates are not seen deterring the Riksbank from tightening next Thursday.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Strong performances across the region as the Real recovered from post-BCB declines after a 4th 50 bp cut but no firm signal that the Selic rate has reached the cycle low, while the Lira also strengthened irrespective of another bigger CBRT ease and potential for deeper US sanctions against Turkey and the Rand shrugged off some soft data on latest Eskom load-shedding at the lower end of the scale, alongside the more buoyant risk mood noted above. Last, but by no means least, the Rouble extended its winning streak ahead of Friday’s CBR meeting that is expected to confirm a pause if not end to rate reductions.</p>",

However, her comments did liven up proceedings even though the bar was high for anything new in terms of policy with Bunds posting a fresh Eurex session peak at 172.99 before turning full circle and a bit more to trade through the earlier trough. Similarly and perhaps perversely, the Euro breached 1.1150 and got to within a pip of the 200 DMA vs the Buck before easing back and the moves follow her contentions that recent data and surveys suggest some stabilisation in the Eurozone economy, but inflation remains muted and ongoing stimulus is necessary.</p>",

UK’s FTSE 100 modestly outperforms (+0.5%) with banks, and homebuilders supported as election voting gets underway – with exit polls expected around 22:00GMT (Full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite). Sectors have shown somewhat of a recovery since the open and now trade mostly in the green vs. a mixed start – defensives retreat whilst cyclicals gain traction. In terms of individual movers, Tullow Oil (+11.8%) continues to pare back from its recent 70% slump with the aid of rising oil prices acting as tailwind. Elsewhere, Balfour Beatty (+4.2%) benefits from its latest trading update which sees FY profit from operations ahead of expectations. Similarly, a positive trading update sees Ocado (+2.5%) supported. Nestle (+0.5%) shares are underpinned by source reports that it is mulling the sale of its ice cream business, which could be valued at USD 4bln. On the flip side, Germany’s Metro (-1.7%) is subdued post-earnings, whilst AB InBev (-1.5%) hovers near the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after Australia competition watchdog ACCC expressed concern about Asahi Group’s proposed purchase of AB InBev’s Carlton &amp; United Breweries unit.</p><p>Boeing (BA) - China's Aviation Regulator Official has raised serious concerns with the Co. regarding design changes to the 737 Max.

Usd/Chf has nudged up to circa 0.9830 from 0.9810 and Eur/Chf is near the top of a 1.0924-48 range even though the Euro has drifted down against the Dollar within 1.1145-25 parameters ahead of the ECB. The single currency may be wary about key technical resistance just above 1.1150 in the form of the 200 DMA (1.1155) rather than any fundamental change in language or policy insight from new head Lagarde, while flow-wise decent option expiry interest between 1.1120-25 and 1.1090-1.1100 (1 bn and 2.2 bn respectively) could be exerting some downside pressure. Meanwhile, the TRY firmed in light of the latest CBTR decision which kept its cautious stance despite a deeper than forecast 200bps cut. Further, the Central Bank noted of signs that inflation is close to materialise close to lower bound of its October projects. USD/TRY breached 5.7800 to the downside to low of 5.7740 (vs. 5.7980 pre-announcement) before stabilising around 5.7800.</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP/SEK/NOK -</strong> The Aussie continues to outperform across the board, as Aud/Usd squeezes higher and through a longer term downtrend to target 0.6900 and Aud/Nzd consolidates around 1.0450 given a more subdued Kiwi vs its US counterpart after losing altitude on the approach to 0.6500, while Sterling is meandering on GE day, with Cable pivoting 1.3200 and Eur/Gbp straddling 0.8430. Note, a hefty 1.1 bn option expiry at the 1.3200 strike may keep the Pound tethered awaiting the vote outcome. Elsewhere, another swing in sentiment for the Scandi Crowns after dismal Swedish jobs data vs a boost in Norwegian oil investment. Eur/Sek nudging 10.4500, Eur/Nok off near 10.1500 highs.</p><p>Israel’s Parliament approved a motion to conduct a new national election on March 2nd, which will be the 3rd election in less than a year.

WTI and Brent futures saw a very modest pop higher shortly after the release of the IEA Monthly Oil Market report - which aligned itself more with the OPEC report as they both kept global demand growth forecasts unchanged for 2019 and 2020 whilst EIA saw a modest revision higher of 50k BPD to its 2020 forecast. The report also noted that global oil demand rose by 900k BPD in Q3 2019 – highest annual growth in year. WTI and Brent futures meander around session highs above 59/bbl and 64/bbl respectively as the complex eyes awaits its next catalyst(s) and have seen some upside on the recent geopolitical rhetoric out of China. Elsewhere, spot gold is flatlining around USD 1475/oz ahead of its FOMC high of USD 1478.90/oz and on stand-by for upcoming events. Copper meanwhile touched resistance just under USD 2.8/lb amid a strengthening USD and some consolidation following six sessions of consecutive gains. Finally, nickel prices hit their highest in almost two weeks – with touted FOMO the main driver.</p><p>IEA Monthly Oil Market Report maintains global oil demand growth for 2019 and 2020 at 1mln and 1.2mln BPD respectively. Projected oil demand is set to fall by 75k BPD in 2019, will be the first annual decline. Projected OPEC output is still 700k BPD above Q2 2020 demand for its crude and 1mln BPD above Q2 demand. Even if OPEC+ strictly follow pact, only 530k BPD of crude would be withdrawn from the market vs. November.

The focus will therefore fall on how Lagarde intends to run the central bank, and its upcoming strategic policy review, which will likely be formally announced at the December confab; but there is a risk that this meeting will be light on details, which may possibly result in horizontal price action. Many believe Lagarde's first task will be uniting a divided Governing Council, where there are mixed views on the efficacy and risks of loose(r) policy, as well as the practicalities of the ECB’s decision-making functions. Lagarde is also expected to reiterate her call on fiscal authorities to do more to support the Eurozone economy. Elsewhere, updated economic projections may see near-term growth forecasts nudged up slightly, though further forecasts are subject to downside risks; inflation forecasts are seen little changed. <strong>ECB Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45GMT, (13:45CET, 07:45ET), On Thursday 12th December 2019, Press Conference Due At 13:30GMT, (14:30CET, 08:30ET).&nbsp;</strong></p>",

UK’s FTSE 100 modestly outperforms (+0.5%) with banks, and homebuilders supported as election voting gets underway – with exit polls expected around 22:00GMT (Full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite). Sectors have shown somewhat of a recovery since the open and now trade mostly in the green vs. a mixed start – defensives retreat whilst cyclicals gain traction. In terms of individual movers, Tullow Oil (+11.8%) continues to pare back from its recent 70% slump with the aid of rising oil prices acting as tailwind. Elsewhere, Balfour Beatty (+4.2%) benefits from its latest trading update which sees FY profit from operations ahead of expectations. Similarly, a positive trading update sees Ocado (+2.5%) supported. Nestle (+0.5%) shares are underpinned by source reports that it is mulling the sale of its ice cream business, which could be valued at USD 4bln. On the flip side, Germany’s Metro (-1.7%) is subdued post-earnings, whilst AB InBev (-1.5%) hovers near the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after Australia competition watchdog ACCC expressed concern about Asahi Group’s proposed purchase of AB InBev’s Carlton &amp; United Breweries unit.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The DXY is clinging to the 97.000 handle amidst broad-based Greenback depreciation in wake of the FOMC that contained enough dovish elements to keep the index depressed, including a muted view of inflation, flat 2020 dot plots and Fed Chair Powell raising the bar for any reversal of the mid-cycle insurance easing.

On that note, US PPI data comes hot on the heels of the last 2019 policy meeting and yesterday’s mixed CPI metrics, while initial claims provide the first post-NFP snapshot of the labour market that may not be as tight as the Central Bank previously perceived.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/TRY</strong></p><p>All paring gains vs the Buck, with the Franc taking some heed of more NIRP and currency intervention backing from the SNB that is flagging no rate normalisation for the duration of the forecast horizon. Usd/Chf has nudged up to circa 0.9830 from 0.9810 and Eur/Chf is near the top of a 1.0924-48 range even though the Euro has drifted down against the Dollar within 1.1145-25 parameters ahead of the ECB. The single currency may be wary about key technical resistance just above 1.1150 in the form of the 200 DMA (1.1155) rather than any fundamental change in language or policy insight from new head Lagarde, while flow-wise decent option expiry interest between 1.1120-25 and 1.1090-1.1100 (1 bn and 2.2 bn respectively) could be exerting some downside pressure. Conversely, the Lira does not appear to be too perturbed about the CBRT slashing rates again imminently as Usd/Try hovers just below 5.8000.</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP/SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie continues to outperform across the board, as Aud/Usd squeezes higher and through a longer term downtrend to target 0.6900 and Aud/Nzd consolidates around 1.0450 given a more subdued Kiwi vs its US counterpart after losing altitude on the approach to 0.6500, while Sterling is meandering on GE day, with Cable pivoting 1.3200 and Eur/Gbp straddling 0.8430. Note, a hefty 1.1 bn option expiry at the 1.3200 strike may keep the Pound tethered awaiting the vote outcome. Elsewhere, another swing in sentiment for the Scandi Crowns after dismal Swedish jobs data vs a boost in Norwegian oil investment. Eur/Sek nudging 10.4500, Eur/Nok off near 10.1500 highs.</p>",

Indeed, Bunds immediately ran into offers and saw some accelerated selling following final German inflation data, although this was uniformly unrevised as widely expected, so unlikely to have been the catalyst. More likely deeper bear-steepening along the US Treasury curve and a failure to sustain gains through the aforementioned upside tech hurdle has sapped strength in the 10 year debt future as attention switches to today’s agenda and especially the ECB policy meeting/first press conference from new President Lagarde.</p>",

Fed dropped its language from the statement regarding uncertainties for the outlook remaining and said it will continue to monitor incoming data</strong>, including global developments and muted inflation pressures. Furthermore, the Fed repeated that job gains are solid, but inflation is still below target and that business fixed investment and exports remain weak.</p><p><strong>- Dot Plots: 2019: 1.6% (Prev. 1.9%), 2020: 1.6% (Prev. 1.9%), 2021: 1.9% (Prev. 2.1%), 2022: 2.1% (Prev. 2.4%) and long-run: 2.5% (Prev. 2.5%).</strong></p><p><strong>- Fed projections show an unchanged rate throughout 2020 and a single hike in 2021, although 4 of the 17 policymakers see a single hike in 2020 as likely to be appropriate.</strong></p><p>- Fed Chair Powell said the US economic outlook is a favourable one and that policy is not on a pre-set course, while he added that current monetary policy is somewhat accommodative<strong>. Powell also reiterated that a persistent move higher in inflation would have to be seen in order for rate hikes and noted it has been very challenging to get inflation to the 2% target.</strong> Furthermore, Powell commented that three rate cuts wasn't the Fed's plan when it began cutting and that the need for rate increases is less than it was in the mid/late 90s cutting cycle.

This benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts in which <strong>EUR/USD</strong> surged above 1.1100 but was stopped short by resistance ahead of 1.1150 and its nearby 200DMA at 1.1155, while <strong>GBP/USD</strong> prodded above 1.3200 ahead of today’s general election in which the latest polls suggested PM Johnson’s Conservatives remain ahead of the Labour Party albeit by a varied margin of between 5-12 points. Elsewhere, <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> were higher although <strong>USD/JPY</strong> was subdued in the aftermath of the FOMC which antipodeans also benefitted from, with <strong>AUD/USD</strong> further helped by technical buying following a breakout from the 12-month downtrend line. Meanwhile, other regional currencies also took their swipe at the greenback in which <strong>USD/HKD</strong> extended on this week’s slide to briefly below the 7.8000 level to print a 6-month low.</p><p><strong>Brazil Central Bank cut the Selic rate by 50bps to 4.50% as expected via unanimous decision</strong> and stated the economic recovery is gaining steam but current stage of the cycle warrants caution in its next steps.

(Newswires/BBC)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were relatively quiet with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures flatlining just below the USD 59.00/bb level as oil prices consolidated from the prior day’s swing where initial pressure had been triggered by a surprise build in EIA crude inventories, before prices retraced the downside given that it was still at a narrower build than the prior day’s API. Nonetheless, the energy complex has since kept to within a tight range, with the somewhat varied overnight sentiment also keeping prices in check. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> found mild support as the greenback weakened post-FOMC owing to Fed Chair Powell’s precondition for a persistent rise in inflation before hiking rates, while <strong>copper</strong> gradually extended on this week’s gains and home sin on the USD 2.80/lb level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p><strong>US warned North Korea of consequences if it carries out threats of a spectacular weapons test in the new year</strong> but added it will be flexible if it stays in talks.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are varied as ongoing trade uncertainty heading into this week’s tariff deadline and today’s looming risk events (UK election, ECB meeting) have dampened the momentum from Wall St where sentiment was mildly underpinned following the FOMC meeting where the Fed kept rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75% as expected and projected no change in rates for next year. Fed Chair Powell also provided a somewhat dovish tone as he reiterated that significant, persistent inflation increases are needed to hike rates and that it has been very challenging to get inflation to the 2% target. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are mixed as the former suffers from broad losses across its sectors including underperformance in tech and financials, while the Japanese benchmark is kept afloat on a predominantly weaker currency but with gains also limited by a surprise 4th consecutive contraction in Machinery Orders to represent its longest streak of declines in over a decade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) outperforms and briefly topped the 27k level with the index led by a surge in Chinese tech names, although sentiment in the mainland is less optimistic with Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) subdued by the tariff-threat overhang.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued and briefly attempted a breakdown of the 97.00 level following the FOMC and press conference where Fed Chair Powell provided dovish comments on inflation and suggested a prerequisite of persistent increases to inflation before a rate hike. This benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts in which EUR/USD surged above 1.1100 but was stopped short by resistance ahead of 1.1150 and its nearby 200DMA at 1.1155, while GBP/USD prodded above 1.3200 ahead of today’s general election in which the latest polls suggested PM Johnson’s Conservatives remain ahead of the Labour Party albeit by a varied margin of between 5-12 points. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses are higher but USD/JPY is subdued in the aftermath of the FOMC which antipodeans also benefitted from, and with AUD/USD further helped by technical buying following a breakout from the 12-month downtrend line. Meanwhile, other regional currencies also took their swipe at the greenback in with USD/HKD extending on this week’s slide to briefly below 7.8000 level to print a 6-month low.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs track the post-FOMC gains in T-notes and following the abysmal Machine Orders data from Japan, but with price action kept tepid heading into the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p>",
