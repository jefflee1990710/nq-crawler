MPC reiterated that monetary policy could respond in either direction in order to hit its inflation target in which monetary policy could be required if global growth fails to stabilise and Brexit uncertainties remain entrenched. However, it added that should these risks not materialise and the economy performs broadly in-line with the MPC’s projection, gradual and limited rate rises could be needed.

As the stock market found its limits, the havens – Treasuries, XAU and JPY – found their strength into the afternoon, desks note that with expectations of depleting liquidity heading into next week and year-end, there is likely to be elements of book squaring/position closing, causing investors to take advantage of any volatility; note the VIX is acutely low, sitting just above 12. Micron (MU) were firmer after its earnings which were in line and guided lower than expected for Q2, however the co. signalled a bottoming out of its financial performance in Q2, whilst its 8-k filing also removed the mention of it being mindful of macroeconomic and trade uncertainties. LiveNation (LYV) surged almost 10% after source reports stated that it reached a tentative agreement with the Department of Justice over its antitrust concerns; the story was later confirmed by LYV. Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) were higher after The Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate is unconstitutional but sent the case back to reconsider; Oppenheimer stated the ACA isn’t going anywhere soon, and JP Morgan highlighted the two companies hold the greatest exposure to the ACA. Roku (ROKU) were higher after a positive mention at Motley Fool, and Dropbox (DBX) reportedly saw a positive mention from Gordon Haskett. General Motors (GM) initially opened lower but ended the day relatively flat after it announced it is to recall ~900k vehicles, while Uber (UBER) had its rental car services in Germany banned by a Frankfurt court, which stated that the ride hailing company is lacking a license to offer passengers transport services via rental car providers. SPX +0.5% at 3205, NDX +0.7% at 8887, DJ +0.5% at 28377.</p><p>The T-Note sold off in the earlier session, catching momentum as US participants came to their desks, although the losses were reversed heading into the close, leaving the T-Note slightly firmer, with yields falling most pronounced in the belly, by approximately 2bps. Desks note that as liquidity begins to thin, desks will be eager to close positions and take advantage of any large moves, with this Friday likely serving as a last chance before Christmas for many. Thursday’s reversal of the move higher in yields could potentially be technically driven as the 2s10s flirted with 30bps earlier on, perhaps the misses in the Philly Fed Index and US housing starts tamed the Treasury sell off somewhat, too, whilst some desks attributed participants ceasing the low prices before the weekend. T-notes (H0) futures settled 4+ ticks higher at 128-10.</p>",

As the stock market found its limits, the havens – Treasuries, XAU and JPY – found their strength into the afternoon, desks note that with expectations of depleting liquidity heading into next week and year-end, there is likely to be elements of book squaring/position closing, causing investors to take advantage of any volatility; note the VIX is acutely low, sitting just above 12. The over-arching themes remain risk supportive, Phase One looks ready to be signed in January (something US Treasury Sec. Mnuchin stressed on Thursday), the strong November NFP report abated near-term employment concerns for the US consumer (read: powerhouse), whilst the holiday season historically points to further upside in thinner trade as portfolio managers call it a year. There was a slew of central bank rate decisions on Thursday, BoE stood pat with two dovish dissenters, as expected; Riksbank hiked, but evidence of a one-and-done saw some weakness in the SEK upon release; BoJ and Norges were mainly non-events, with the latter’s currency firming after no outlook downgrades; Banxico cut by 25bps as was expected. US data was less inspiring, where existing home sales for November missed expectations with the prior revised lower, although the outlook remains favourable; the Philly Fed survey for December missed expectations in the headline, but the forward-looking New Orders sub-index picked up slightly. Looking ahead, NKE reports after the bell, followed on Friday by US GDP, PCE and the final University of Michigan (Dec), with many likely thereafter throwing in the towel before Christmas.</p><p><strong>* US TREASURY SECRETARY MNUCHIN </strong>said that China will double the purchases of agricultural goods from the US under the Phase One pact, adding that the US-China signing will be the middle of January, in line with previous US official commentary. Mnuchin stressed that the trade pact is not open to renegotiation. Elsewhere, the Treasury Sec. said the USMCA trade pact should add 0.5pp to US GDP, also that the strength of the USD is a sign of the strength of the US economy.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Bullard</strong> (non-voter, dove) said he has pencilled in no rate increases for 2020, and reiterates that the Fed should be data dependence, the WSJ reported. Like other Fed members, the St. Louis President said he would want to see more inflation before he would call for rate hikes, “I’m not putting a lot of weight” on the idea that inflation is going to be particularly high anytime soon.</p><p><strong>* BOE</strong>: Policymakers once again opted to stand pat on rates at 0.75% with a 7-2 vote split as Saunders and Haskel remained as dissenters to the decision. Overall, a majority of policymakers opted to refrain from policy action on the basis that economic data since the November meeting had been broadly as expected and it was too early to judge how recent global and domestic policy announcements would impact the economic outlook. Saunders and Haskel voted in favour of a 25bps rate reduction given their assessment that the economy had actually performed a little softer than expected, whilst raising concerns over subdued core inflation and slowing employment growth; an argument that was unable to convince Vlieghe to switch camps despite some outside bets for him to do so. In terms of the overall tone of the statement, the MPC refrained from making any policy inferences from last week’s election outcome and instead reiterated their assumption that there will be an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. Furthermore, the MPC reiterated that monetary policy could respond in either direction in order to hit its inflation target. Additionally, looser monetary policy could be required if global growth fails to stabilise and Brexit uncertainties remain entrenched. However, should these risks not materialise and the economy performs broadly in-line with the MPC’s projection, gradual and limited rate rises could be needed. In terms of the outlook for the UK economy, the Bank looks for just 0.1% growth in Q4 and reiterated the likelihood of headline CPI falling to around 1.25% in the spring, owing to the temporary effects of falls in regulated energy and water prices. With regards to the labour market, policymakers noted some loosening, however it remains tight overall, adding that the unemployment rate remains stable and employment is around the record high. Overall, the BoE opted to conclude the year without much in the way of fanfare and broadly stuck to the “wait-and-see” message.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES (NOV) </strong>fell by 1.7% to 5.35mln from 5.44mln, missing the expected 5.44mln, with the prior revised lower from 5.46mln. Wells Fargo’s analysts look past the decline, which it attributes to a 1.2% fall in single-family sales and a 5.1% drop in condo sales, pointing to the 2.7% gain over the year, “Sales should continue to improve with support from low mortgage rates, although inventory shortages will limit the upside.” The bank notes that homes are selling on the market in an average 38 days, compared to 48 days in November 2018., a further nod to demand strength, although Wells caveat that exuberant upside is limited, with inventories down by 5.7% Y/Y, giving the lowest November reading since 1999.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLED 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 128-10. </strong>The T-Note sold off in the earlier session, catching momentum as US participants came to their desks, although the losses were reversed heading into the close, leaving the T-Note slightly firmer, with yields falling most pronounced in the belly, by approximately 2bps. Desks note that as liquidity begins to thin, desks will be eager to close positions and take advantage of any large moves, with this Friday likely serving as a last chance before Christmas for many. Thursday’s reversal of the move higher in yields could potentially be technically driven as the 2s10s flirted with 30bps earlier on, perhaps the misses in the Philly Fed Index and US housing starts tamed the Treasury sell off somewhat, too, whilst some desks attributed participants ceasing the low prices before the weekend.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLES USD 0.33 HIGHER AT USD 61.18/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.37 HIGHER AT USD 66.54/BBL. </strong>The<strong> </strong>holiday optimism continued to support the energy complex, in addition to the equity market, helping oil benchmarks continue to make multi-month highs. Prices found their impetus as US participants, or those still present, came to their desks. There has been little in the way of energy-specific news flow since the bullish EIA report on Wednesday, where the seasonal risk appetite and OPEC+ supply cuts, in addition to the US-China Phase One progress, remain supportive to energy prices. Note that January WTI futures expire on Thursday.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.45% at 3205, NDX +0.67% at 8887, DJ +0.49% at 28377</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Micron (MU)<strong> </strong>were firmer after its earnings which were in line and guided lower than expected for Q2, however the co. signalled a bottoming out of its financial performance in Q2, whilst its 8-k filing also removed the mention of it being mindful of macroeconomic and trade uncertainties. Conagra Brands (CAG) surged after a beat on EPS and revenues were in line with expectations, the co. also cut its FY20 EPS forecast, although the cut was not as deep as analysts were expecting. CAG also expect strong performance in H2 2020. Darden Restaurants (DRI) were lower after its Q2 SSS missed expectations printing 2.0%, 0.1% beneath expectations.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>LiveNation (LYV) surged almost 10% after<strong> </strong>source reports stated that it reached a tentative agreement with the Department of Justice over its antitrust concerns; the story was later confirmed by LYV. Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) were higher after The Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate is unconstitutional but sent the case back to reconsider; Oppenheimer stated the ACA isn’t going anywhere soon, and JP Morgan highlighted the two companies hold the greatest exposure to the ACA. Roku (ROKU) were higher after a positive mention at Motley Fool, and Dropbox (DBX) reportedly saw a positive mention from Gordon Haskett. General Motors (GM) initially opened lower but ended the day relatively flat after it announced it is to recall ~900k vehicles. Uber (UBER) had its Uber rental car services in Germany banned by a Frankfurt court, which stated that the ride hailing company is lacking a license to offer passengers transport services via rental car providers. Netflix (NFLX) were higher after a positive mention from Goldman, who maintained a conviction buy with a PT of USD 400, stating expectations for its subscriber growth and related financials in 2020 and beyond are too low. Goldman Sachs (GS) is reportedly in talks with the US government to pay a two-billion dollar fine, admit guild, and agree to an ongoing oversight of its compliance procedures to resolve the criminal investigation of the 1MDB probe, according to WSJ. Previous reports had stated that the fine is likely to be under USD 2bln. In the tail-end of the session, FBN’s Gasparino citing sources announced GS are to face billions more in settlements, on top of the initial one over the scandal.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> IAC (IAC) is to divest its shares in online dating service Match (MTCH). The information reported Facebook (FB) held talks to buy Cirrus Logic (CRUS) earlier in the year. PayPal (PYPL) announced it completed the acquisition of GoPay. Ecolab Inc. (ECL) is to separate its Upstream energy business of Nalco Champion and combine it with Apergy (APY) in a tax-free transaction.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK: </strong>Riksbank hiked rates by 25bps as expected and as it had long been signalling. Opposition to the hike, however, was apparent with Jansson and Breman entering reservations. Preferring, instead of today’s decision, for the forecast period to indicate a hike in Q1 2020 or further. The repo rate forecasts indicate the rate will remain unchanged for 2020 and 2021, with just 10bp of upside indicated by 2022. The decision to hike in a ‘one and done’ move was as expected; the main surprise was the reservations from Breman as this was her first meeting and the comment that the Riksbank could, if it became necessary, make policy more expansionary through ‘other measures’ as well as cuts. Reaction was minimal, though EUR/SEK saw downside heading into the release, but this was short-lived as the SEK depreciated on the announcement; likely due to this being a one-off hike not the start of a cycle. Looking ahead, Nordea noted that while the Riksbank’s forecast is for rates to be left unchanged there is a risk they it be forced to introduce stimulus measures again; due to the credibility of their 2% inflation target coming under fire. Xper (XPER) and TiVo (TIVO) are to merge in an all-stock transaction which equates to a combined USD 3bln in enterprise value. The shares will be converted into shares of the new company based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.455 XPER share per existing TIVO share.</p><p>* <strong>NORGES:</strong> Norges Bank left rates unchanged at 1.5% and the repo path was maintained at 1.6% for the entire forecast period. Given that there had been some expectations for a reduction in the forecast period, largely due to the downbeat regional network survey, the NOK did strengthen somewhat. Overall, the decision was as expected and indicates that the Norges Bank will most likely remain on-hold for the period ahead while retaining the possibility for a hike.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO:</strong> The Mexican Central Bank cut rates by 25bps as expected by all analysts surveyed at Reuters. However, UBS had highlighted that a 50bp was not out of the question given the divided MPC, and with USDMXN beneath 19, virtual approval of the USMCA trade deal, US/China Trade ‘Phase One’ deal, and mitigating Brexit risks could all lean towards a 50bps cut, especially given inflation is at the mid-point of its 2-4% target range. However, the board was not as divided this time, where only 1 member opted for a 50bp cut taking its key rate to 7.00% (at its previous meeting, 2 members, Esquivel and Heath, voted for a 50bp cut). Banxico maintained its language that the current environment continues to present risks that could affect the macroeconomic conditions in the country and its potential for growth and maintained that balance of risks remain tilted to the downside in the uncertain environment. The Central Bank highlighted headline and core inflation in 2020 will reflect greater slack in the economy and higher than expected minimum wage hike, that could see inflation moderately above where it has been in the previous quarterly report; heading into the decision some had questioned whether the latest minimum wage hike combined with deeper easing would spur unnecessary upside to inflation. On Pemex, the board reiterated that uncertainty linked to credit ratings of PEMEX and sovereign persists, although previously Heath had stated that a possible credit rating downgrade for PEMEX was not a big risk to economic growth, but more of a risk to financial markets. Banxico concluded that although Q4 information is limited, it estimates that recent weakness persists. Given the expected cut and very similar statement, USDMXN was very much unreactive, however MXN slightly strengthened as only 1 member opted for a 50bp cut, although the moves were very short lived and it returned to pre-announcement levels.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: DXY </strong>traded within 97.20 and 97.50 parameters today. The index<strong> </strong>ended the day rather flat but marginally lower today after it had a strong surge this week. Today’s mixed data put a cap to the gains following poor existing home sales, a mixed Philly-fed, and a rise in jobless claims for the week which feeds into the next payroll report. <strong>GBP</strong> continued to weaken as it breached 1.30 to the downside, with technicians eyeing 1.2984-76 as next key levels. Today’s weakness stemmed after a poor retail-sales, however the pre-Christmas period has had participants questioning the reliability of the report as the black-Friday/cyber week dates will be included in the next report. Selling was exacerbated heading into the BoE rate decision, however as the Central Bank kept to its script, some losses were reversed, perhaps as participants were expecting a more dovish outcome. <strong>AUD</strong> traded firmer after last night’s jobs report, albeit the large increase was driven by part time jobs. <strong>NZD</strong> also traded firmer amid a mixed Q3 GDP report and a narrower trade deficit. Riskbank hiked by 0.25bp as expected although two were against the move, although it confirmed that the move concludes policy normalisation and could provide more stimulus if needed. EURSEK traded relatively flat today, although at the time of the rate release the cross rose slightly amid the hike confirming it is a “one and done” move. Havens were generally firmer today, JPY was unphased by the latest BoJ rate decision, however gold traded marginally higher breaching 1480 briefly, a level it resides just shy of heading into Asia trade. In <strong>EMFX,</strong> USDMXN was unreactive following the latest Banxico rate decision, however very slight Peso strength was seen against the buck as this time, there was only one dissenter opting for a 50bp cut, down from two previously. USDMXN losses were short-lived and the cross traded around pre-announcement levels for the rest of the session still beneath the 19.00 handle, despite initially trading above it earlier this morning. USDTRY tested key Fib resistance after breaching October highs, largely shrugging off CBRT minutes as bullish technical and Lira negative geopolitical factors remain principle drivers. However, USDBRL held steady around 4.0600 as the BCB lifted GDP projections in its Q4 inflation report, although the cross is flat as the US session ends.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>The Mexican central bank is expected to cut rates by 25bp to 7.25%, which would be the fourth consecutive rate cut; all sixteen analysts surveyed by Reuters look for a 25bp cut.</li><li><strong>PREVIOUS MEETING: </strong>At its last confab, the Banxico opted to lower rates by 25bps; however, two board members, Heath and Esquivel opted for a deeper 50bp cut. The latest minutes revealed that the majority of members said the growth outlook had continued to deteriorate, noting that it was facing risks to inflation, and that monetary policy would be adjusted in a firm and opportune manner. Banxico tends to follow a similar footing to the US Federal Reserve, although now the Fed is on hold; Banxico previously has stated that although it monitors the Fed, it is not a direct determinant for its monetary policy decisions.</li><li><strong>25BPS CUT</strong>: Although inflation is in line with its target, the core measure is running at 3.7% (the Banxico’s target range is 2-4%), while the recent 20% rise to the minimum wage has given rise to some concerns that further easing might result in unnecessary upside to inflation. Another reason against a deeper 50bps cut is that Banxico may not want to shock markets , thus maintaining its easing bias at a gradual pace; the latest minutes signalled a majority believe an adjustment to monetary policy should be gradual. TD Securities believes a 50bps cut would be too aggressive, noting that “the relatively unleveraged nature of Mexico's economy dulls the growth-positive impact of cuts, while net negative fixed income flows over the past 6 months currently render MXN vulnerable.”</li><li><strong>A DEEPER CUT?</strong> Despite all analysts looking for a 25bps cut, analysts at UBS (who are in line with the consensus) highlights that a 50bps move is not out of the question, given the divided MPC, and with USDMXN beneath 19, virtual approval of the USMCA trade deal, US/China Trade ‘Phase One’ deal, and mitigating Brexit risks could all lean towards a 50bps cut, especially given inflation is at the mid-point of its 2-4% target range. UBS believes that if a 50bps cut is seen, Banxico will signal towards less aggressive easing ahead.</li><li><strong>PEMEX:</strong> In its latest meeting, the Banxico maintained its language that uncertainty persists to the credit rating outlook for Pemex and Mexico’s sovereign debt. However, the dovish board member Heath stated that the possible credit rating downgrade for PEMEX was not a big risk to its economic growth, but it was more of a risk to financial markets.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>A week can be a long time in politics, but not always for the Pound it seems as Cable continues its retreat from post-election exit poll high and Eur/Gbp rebounds further from Conservative majority low. In fact, the former is now under GE day lows and almost 5 big figures down from 1.3500+ highs, while the cross has completed a round trip from sub-0.8300 to just over 0.8500 in the same period. The catalyst, not bleak pre-Xmas UK retail sales, flat CBI distributive trades or an unchanged and still mostly Brexit dependent BoE, but concerns about no deal with the EU after December 2020 if PM Johnson succeeds in getting a further extension blocked alongside the vote on his WAB tomorrow.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> remains relatively rangebound between 97.000-500 after another attempt to breach the topside was thwarted by disappointing US data, including weekly claims, existing home sales and the LEI, and a somewhat mixed Philly Fed survey. However, the Greenback derived some underlying support at the expense of others and a steeper US Treasury curve amidst increasingly thin seasonal volumes and Fed dove Bullard giving his backing for no further policy adjustments next year.</p><p><strong>AUD/NOK</strong></p><p>The Aussie was bid from the outset and outperforming in wake of an upbeat labour report that prompted a marked shift in RBA rate (cut) expectations for February 2020, but the Norwegian Crown has emerged as the best major following the last Norges Bank policy meeting of the current year and updated depo rate projections that infer a 10 bp hike in 2022. Aud/Usd still bid within 0.6883-49 parameters, while Eur/Nok hovers near the base of a 10.0210-9.9575 band.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The<strong> </strong>safe-havens have benefited from the Dollar’s inability to break higher, as noted above, rather than any real or significant downturn in risk sentiment, but the Yen has bounced more firmly from 109.60+ lows through 108.50 and not far from chart resistance in the 109.20-30 zone, while the Franc has consolidated recovery gains beyond 0.9800 and 1.0900 vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>NZD/SEK</strong></p><p>Choppy trade for the Kiwi and Swedish Krona following mixed NZ Q3 GDP metrics and a pronounced revision to q/q growth in the previous quarter, while the Riksbank stuck to its script and tightened by ¼ point despite 2 dissentions, but effectively confirmed that the move concludes policy normalisation and it could provide more stimulus if needed. Usd/Nzd nestling just shy of 0.6600 vs Eur/Sek towards the top of 10.4920-4450 extremes.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>The single currency and Loonie have both gradually lost momentum vs their US counterpart, as Eur/Usd faded ahead of 1.1150 and Usd/Cad waned on approach to 1.3100 following considerably worse than forecast Canadian wholesale trade data.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Try has tested key Fib resistance after breaching October highs, largely shrugging off CBRT minutes as bullish technical and Lira negative geopolitical factors remain principle drivers. However, Usd/Brl held steady around 4.0600 as the BCB lifted GDP projections in its Q4 inflation report and Usd/Rub remained lower circa 62.3500 amidst firm oil prices and reports of shootings in Moscow close to the FSB HQ.</p>",

There were also separate comments from NEC Director Kudlow who suggested the US will monitor China compliance over 6 to 9 months, while Kudlow reportedly stated that Chinese President Xi told Henry Kissinger he would rather deal with President Trump who will focus more on trade rather than Democrats who won't talk about trade issues but instead will focus on human rights and other things. (Newswires/CNBC/Twitter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets were lacklustre following an indecisive lead from US where the major indices finished flat due to a lack of drivers amid the pre-holiday lull</strong>. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.3%)</strong> was subdued by weakness in energy and the top-weighted financials sector, with early gains in the index wiped out after better than expected jobs data dampened February rate cut hopes, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) </strong>continued its marginal pullback from the 24k level amid a choppy currency and after a lack of fireworks at the BoJ policy meeting. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (Unch) </strong>traded indecisively and failed to take advantage of another substantial liquidity effort by the PBoC as well as expectations it may fine tune measures and use targeted stimulus next year, with some reports suggesting China’s private enterprises are facing the worst funding squeeze in more than two decades. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower and prices eyed a test on the 152.00 level to the downside with demand subdued alongside an uneventful BoJ policy announcement where the central bank maintained all policy settings as expected and reiterated its forward guidance that rates will remain at current or lower levels for as long as needed.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 250bln via 14-day reverse repos.

BoJ repeated its assessment that Japan's economy is expanding moderately as a trend but cut the assessment on industrial production in which it states industrial output is falling due to impact of natural disasters. BoJ later announced plans decided in April to lend ETFs to markets under a special facility aimed at improving liquidity in the ETF market, while it will amend the scheme aimed at encouraging banks to increase lending and will allow borrowers to roll over lending under certain conditions. (Newswires)</p><p>BoJ Governor Kuroda said overseas risks remain at high levels and warrants attention, appropriate to guide policy with easing bias, BoJ's NIRP is appropriate, deepening negative rates would an option but cannot cut indefinitely as it would affect banks. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Riksbank hiked its Repo Rate by 25bps to 0.00%, as expected. </strong>Forecast for repo rate is unchanged, repo rate is expected to remain at 0% in the coming years. <strong>Deputy governors Breman and Jansson entered reservations against the rate hike</strong>. Improved prospects would justify a higher interest rate. But if the economy were instead to develop more weakly than forecast, the Executive Board could both cut the repo rate and take other measures to make monetary policy more expansionary. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Norges Bank left its Key Policy Rate unchanged at 1.50%, as expected in a unanimous decision. Norges Bank left its rate path unchanged for 2020 and 2021 but upgraded 2022 to 1.60% from 1.50%. </strong>Norges noted that monetary stance has become less expansionary and a weaker-than-projected krone implies in isolation a higher policy rate path, whilst on the other hand, the upturn in the Norwegian economy appears to be a little more moderate than previously assumed.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A mostly uninspiring session for European bourses thus far [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.1%]</strong> – following on from a similarly lacklustre Asia-Pac session. Sectors are flat/mixed with defensives modestly firmer vs. their cyclical peers, with the exception of energy names who remain buoyed by yesterday’s advances in the complex. Individual stocks stories remain in focus given the lack of fresh macro catalysts. The IT sector failed to capitalise on optimistic earnings from Micron (+4.1% pre-market) late doors yesterday with STMicroelectronics (+0.3%), Micro Focus (-0.1%) and Dialog Semiconductor (-0.1%) all relatively unfazed. Elsewhere, NMC Health (-9.8%) has wiped out yesterday’s gains as the negative note from activist short-seller Muddy Waters continues to cause concern around the Co’s balance sheet. Swatch (-1.2%) and Richemont (-1.4%) are weighed on by a 3.5% YY decline in Swiss watch exports. In terms of other individual movers, Hugo Boss (-2.4%), Capita (-4.2%), TUI (-1.9%) trade near the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid negative broker action.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NOK - The Aussie and Norwegian Krona are vying for pole position on the G10 grid following better than expected jobs data overnight and a final 2019 Norges Bank policy meeting that was fractionally less dovish than anticipated. Aud/Usd is back within striking distance of 0.6900, albeit off highs and hovering close to a decent option expiry at 0.6875 (1.1 bn), while Eur/Nok has maintained momentum under the psychological 10.0000 level and got close to support from early October (circa 9.9460) as the CB tweaked is rate path to flag 10 bp worth of tightening in 2022.</p><p>GBP/EUR - The next best majors or beneficiaries of a flagging Dollar, as the DXY drifts down from a 97.421 high to just shy of 97.250, with Cable able to reclaim 1.3100+ status even though UK retail sales fell far short of consensus and the single currency pivots 1.1125 amidst firmer Eurozone bond yields alongside another rise in market-based inflation expectations. Back to the Pound, perhaps some underlying impetus from reports that the EU already has a trade proposal in hand for the UK to consider a day after Brexit on January 31 next year, but more immediately CBI trades loom before the BoE at high noon with the focus on any further dovish dissent or a more united MPC in wake of the election.</p><p>JPY/CAD/CHF/NZD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as Usd/Jpy continues meander above 109.50 and the Yen gleans little fresh direction from the BoJ keeping policy unchanged and an easing bias, while Usd/Cad hovers in a tight band on the 1.3100 handle ahead of Canadian AWE and wholesale trade data. Elsewhere, Usd/Chf is still straddling 0.9800 with the Franc not really responding to a wider Swiss trade surplus as key watch exports fell, and similarly Nzd/Usd failed to get any lasting or clear impetus from NZ GDP data for Q3 as firmer than forecast q/q growth was offset by a y/y miss sharp downgrade to the former for the previous quarter.</p><p>SEK - The Swedish Crown has been choppy between 10.4450-10.4805 parameters in wake of the Riksbank’s last hurrah for the year as a clearly signalled 25 bp repo rate hike was duly delivered, but not without 2 Board members voting against the move and with the accompanying statement caveated by the pledge to ease if the economy does not meet target.</p><p>EM - Yet more pain for the Turkish Lira, as Usd/Try extended further to the upside through mid-October peaks and the high for that month overall before fading a fraction below Fib resistance awaiting CBRT minutes and unfolding Turkish-US developments on the diplomatic front.</p><p>Australian Employment Change (Nov) 39.9k vs. Exp. 14.0k (Prev. -19.0k, Rev. -24.8k). (Newswires) Australian Unemployment Rate (Nov) 5.2% vs. Exp. 5.3% (Prev. 5.3%) Australian Full Time Employment Change (Nov) 4.2k (Prev. -10.3k, Rev. -10.5k) Australian Part Time Employment Change (Nov) 35.7k (Prev. -8.7k, Rev. -14.3k)</p><p>New Zealand GDP (Q3) Q/Q 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.5%, Rev. 0.1%). (Newswires) New Zealand GDP (Q3) Y/Y 2.3% vs. Exp. 2.4% (Prev. 2.1%)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries have all extended losses and are still under pressure as the former dangles just above 171.00, UK equivalent sits within a few ticks of 131.30 and latter crosses 128-00.&nbsp; Seasonal trading conditions are exacerbating price action, though that applies both ways and the current tone/trend is bearish with deeper and potentially more pivotal downside chart targets in close proximity. Hence, the path of least resistance could literally be lower barring something major on the fundamental side that may change the technical landscape, like Thursday’s run of US data or ECB’s Lane.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures remain flat within relatively narrow intraday parameters following the EIA-led upside seen across the complex yesterday. The former resides just under the USD 61/bbl mark, having traded on either side of its 100 WMA (USD 60.77/bbl) throughout APAC hours, while its Brent counterpart remains afloat above the USD 66/bbl mark after testing, but failing to breach support at the round figure overnight. Crude markets have seen little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts in recent days heading into the holiday period, albeit traders will be on the lookout for more “meat on the bones” regarding the China Phase One deal, given the lack of details post-announcement. That said, the thinned market conditions may prompt volatility in energy prices even with a lack of news-flow. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> trades with mild losses and currently resides below the USD 1475/oz mark having dipping below its 50 DMA USD 1477.20/oz with technicians eyeing USD 1470-71/oz for potential support ahead if the 21 DMA at USD 1467.20/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain unchanged intraday below the USD 2.8/lb level given the tentative tone around the marketplace. Finally, Shanghai <strong>aluminium</strong> prices rose to their highest level in over three months and notched a third straight session of gains amid depleting stocks of the metal in Chinese warehouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Sectors are flat/mixed with defensives modestly firmer vs. their cyclical peers, with the exception of energy names who remain buoyed by yesterday’s advances in the complex. Individual stocks stories remain in focus given the lack of fresh macro catalysts. The IT sector failed to capitalise on optimistic earnings from Micron (+4.1% pre-market) late doors yesterday with STMicroelectronics (+0.3%), Micro Focus (-0.1%) and Dialog Semiconductor (-0.1%) all relatively unfazed. Elsewhere, NMC Health (-9.8%) has wiped out yesterday’s gains as the negative note from activist short-seller Muddy Waters continues to cause concern around the Co’s balance sheet. Swatch (-1.2%) and Richemont (-1.4%) are weighed on by a 3.5% YY decline in Swiss watch exports. In terms of other individual movers, Hugo Boss (-2.4%), Capita (-4.2%), TUI (-1.9%) trade near the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid negative broker action.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NOK - The Aussie and Norwegian Krona are vying for pole position on the G10 grid following better than expected jobs data overnight and a final 2019 Norges Bank policy meeting that was fractionally less dovish than anticipated. Aud/Usd is back within striking distance of 0.6900, albeit off highs and hovering close to a decent option expiry at 0.6875 (1.1 bn), while Eur/Nok has maintained momentum under the psychological 10.0000 level and got close to support from early October (circa 9.9460) as the CB tweaked is rate path to flag 10 bp worth of tightening in 2022.</p><p>GBP/EUR - The next best majors or beneficiaries of a flagging Dollar, as the DXY drifts down from a 97.421 high to just shy of 97.250, with Cable able to reclaim 1.3100+ status even though UK retail sales fell far short of consensus and the single currency pivots 1.1125 amidst firmer Eurozone bond yields alongside another rise in market-based inflation expectations. Back to the Pound, perhaps some underlying impetus from reports that the EU already has a trade proposal in hand for the UK to consider a day after Brexit on January 31 next year, but more immediately CBI trades loom before the BoE at high noon with the focus on any further dovish dissent or a more united MPC in wake of the election.</p><p>JPY/CAD/CHF/NZD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as Usd/Jpy continues meander above 109.50 and the Yen gleans little fresh direction from the BoJ keeping policy unchanged and an easing bias, while Usd/Cad hovers in a tight band on the 1.3100 handle ahead of Canadian AWE and wholesale trade data. Elsewhere, Usd/Chf is still straddling 0.9800 with the Franc not really responding to a wider Swiss trade surplus as key watch exports fell, and similarly Nzd/Usd failed to get any lasting or clear impetus from NZ GDP data for Q3 as firmer than forecast q/q growth was offset by a y/y miss sharp downgrade to the former for the previous quarter.</p><p>SEK - The Swedish Crown has been choppy between 10.4450-10.4805 parameters in wake of the Riksbank’s last hurrah for the year as a clearly signalled 25 bp repo rate hike was duly delivered, but not without 2 Board members voting against the move and with the accompanying statement caveated by the pledge to ease if the economy does not meet target.</p><p>EM - Yet more pain for the Turkish Lira, as Usd/Try extended further to the upside through mid-October peaks and the high for that month overall before fading a fraction below Fib resistance awaiting CBRT minutes and unfolding Turkish-US developments on the diplomatic front.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries have all extended losses and are still under pressure as the former dangles just above 171.00, UK equivalent sits within a few ticks of 131.30 and latter crosses 128-00.&nbsp; Seasonal trading conditions are exacerbating price action, though that applies both ways and the current tone/trend is bearish with deeper and potentially more pivotal downside chart targets in close proximity. Hence, the path of least resistance could literally be lower barring something major on the fundamental side that may change the technical landscape, like Thursday’s run of US data or ECB’s Lane.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures remain flat within relatively narrow intraday parameters following the EIA-led upside seen across the complex yesterday. The former resides just under the USD 61/bbl mark, having traded on either side of its 100 WMA (USD 60.77/bbl) throughout APAC hours, while its Brent counterpart remains afloat above the USD 66/bbl mark after testing, but failing to breach support at the round figure overnight. Crude markets have seen little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts in recent days heading into the holiday period, albeit traders will be on the lookout for more “meat on the bones” regarding the China Phase One deal, given the lack of details post-announcement. That said, the thinned market conditions may prompt volatility in energy prices even with a lack of news-flow. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> trades with mild losses and currently resides below the USD 1475/oz mark having dipping below its 50 DMA USD 1477.20/oz with technicians eyeing USD 1470-71/oz for potential support ahead if the 21 DMA at USD 1467.20/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain unchanged intraday below the USD 2.8/lb level given the tentative tone around the marketplace. Finally, Shanghai <strong>aluminium</strong> prices rose to their highest level in over three months and notched a third straight session of gains amid depleting stocks of the metal in Chinese warehouses.</p>",

(-0.2%)</strong> traded indecisively and failed to take advantage of another substantial liquidity effort by the PBoC as well as expectations it may fine tune measures and use targeted stimulus next year, with some reports suggesting China’s private enterprises are facing the worst funding squeeze in more than two decades. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower and prices eyed a test on the 152.00 level to the downside with demand subdued alongside an uneventful BoJ policy announcement where the central bank maintained all policy settings as expected and reiterated its forward guidance that rates will remain at current or lower levels for as long as needed.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 250bln via 14-day reverse repos.

There were also separate comments from NEC Director Kudlow who suggested the US will monitor China compliance over 6 to 9 months, while Kudlow reportedly stated that Chinese President Xi told Henry Kissinger he would rather deal with President Trump who will focus more on trade rather than Democrats who won't talk about trade issues but instead will focus on human rights and other things.

BoJ repeated its assessment that Japan's economy is expanding moderately as a trend but cut the assessment on industrial production in which it states industrial output is falling due to impact of natural disasters. BoJ later announced plans decided in April to lend ETFs to markets under a special facility aimed at improving liquidity in the ETF market, while it will amend the scheme aimed at encouraging banks to increase lending and will allow borrowers to roll over lending under certain conditions.

(Daily Mail)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was only minimally pressured overnight after the House officially impeached US President Trump under both articles regarding Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress as expected, and which sets up a showdown at the Senate where it is seen as unlikely to pass and would require a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office vs. the simple majority that was needed in the Democrat-controlled House. This provided some mild reprieve to the greenback’s transatlantic counterparts to build upon a rebound in <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> from its recent floor at 1.1110 and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also partially benefitted but remained at a sub-1.3100 level with price action contained by the recent Brexit-cliff fears and ahead of the upcoming BoE meeting. Elsewhere, antipodeans were data driven in which <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly surged after Q3 GDP Q/Q topped estimates but with the gains short-lived as GDP Y/Y missed, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was boosted by better than expected Employment data and a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.2% from 5.3% and although the gains were predominantly fuelled by Part-Time jobs, it still led to a drop in the market pricing for an RBA rate cut in February to 38% from over 50%. The Aussie jobs data also lifted <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> which <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was quick to piggyback on, although moves in the latter were eventually faded as attention turned to the BoJ decision which proved to be a non-event.&nbsp;</p><p>Australian Employment Change (Nov) 39.9k vs. Exp. 14.0k (Prev. -19.0k, Rev. -24.8k).

Elsewhere, gold was rangebound but remained afloat on the miniscule pressure for the greenback after President Trump became the 3rd President in history to be impeached by the House, and copper prices continued to meander around the USD 2.80/lb amid the dampened risk tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>T-Notes moved lower alongside the Bund on Wednesday as participants sold duration, with risk appetite remaining elevated in the final few weeks of the year. Some have noted that while activity is winding down for the year, one desk noted a couple of themes still in play: there is still interest in curve steepeners, as seen over the last week or so, particularly with accounts adding to 2s10s; another theme that is clear is the selling of volatility, both in Europe and the US, with the desk noting that the selling came despite the recent fall in implied volatility in both Treasuries and Bunds. \"One area where flows have remained fairly strong is the option market,\" the strategist said, \"perhaps some think the drop off in vol has gone too far,\" and notes that \"the moves over last Christmas perhaps prompted some to position for a repeat, when vol spiked in both fixed income and equities\". T-note (H0) futures settled 9 ticks lower at 128-05+.</p><p><strong>US House voted (230 vs. 197) to impeach President Trump under Article 1 Abuse of Power and voted (229 vs. 198) to impeach President Trump under Article 2 Obstruction of Congress as expected.

Furthermore, Evans added it would take a lot of new data to change his opinion and inflation would need to go meaningfully above 2% for him to support monetary tightening. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawkish)</strong> believes we are in a reasonable place on the balance sheet and that policy is still accommodative, while he added that he is very focused on data and that it is hard to find evidence of deteriorating credit quality at the moment, but the Fed is watching the data.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade lacklustre following an indecisive lead from US where the major indices finished flat due to a lack of drivers in pre-holiday lull trade. ASX 200 (-0.2%) is subdued by weakness in energy and the top-weighted financials sector, with early gains in the index wiped out after better than expected jobs data dampened February rate cut hopes, while the Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) continues its marginal pullback from the 24k level amid a choppy currency. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are indecisive and have failed to take advantage of another substantial liquidity effort by the PBoC as well as expectations it may fine tune measures and use targeted stimulus next year, with some reports suggesting China’s private enterprises are facing the worst funding squeeze in more than two decades.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY has seen minimal pressure overnight after the House officially impeached US President Trump under both articles regarding Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress, which was as expected and sets up a showdown at the Senate where it is seen as unlikely to pass and would require a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office vs. the simple majority that was needed in the Democrat-controlled House. This provided some mild reprieve to the greenback’s transatlantic counterparts to build upon a rebound in EUR/USD from its recent floor at 1.1110 and GBP/USD also partially benefits but remains at a sub-1.3100 level with price action contained by the recent Brexit-cliff fears and ahead of the upcoming BoE meeting. Elsewhere, antipodeans were data driven with NZD/USD briefly surging after Q3 GDP Q/Q topped estimates at 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.6% but with the gains short-lived as GDP Y/Y missed at 2.3% vs. Exp. 2.4%, while AUD/USD was boosted by better than expected jobs data and a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.2% from 5.3% and although the gains in Employment were predominantly fuelled by Part-Time jobs, it still led to a drop in the market pricing for an RBA rate cut in February to 38% from over 50%. The Aussie jobs data lifted AUD/JPY which USD/JPY was quick to piggyback on although gains in the latter were eventually faded as attention turns to the looming BoJ announcement.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices eyeing the 152.00 level to the downside as participants are sidelined ahead of the BoJ policy announcement where no major fireworks are expected.</p>",
