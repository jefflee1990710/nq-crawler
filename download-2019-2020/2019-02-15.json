        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 15 Feb 2019: Trump declares national emergency",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities, dollar, Treasuries, crude.<br />* REAR VIEW: Trump declares emergency over border; weak US industrial production.<br />* NEXT WEEK: US Market Closures due to Presidents Day - Desk will Operate a Normal Service, FOMC Minutes, UK Brexit Secretary Barclay meeting EU Chief Negotiator Barnier.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP DECLARES NATIONAL EMERGENCY: </strong>As expected, US President Trump declared a national emergency over the situation at the US&rsquo; border wall with Mexico, justifying the move to protect the US from the invasion of drugs. Officials said this will leave Trump with USD 8bln for barrier projections vs the 5.75bln he requested. Trump himself is expecting Democrats to provide a legal challenge to the national emergency and suggested that battle may ultimately end up at the US Supreme Court. Lawmakers have concerns that Trump has overstepped the mark by declaring the emergency, and perhaps unconstitutional. Trump also signed off the US government funding bill, averting another shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Beijing trade talks concluded today with ambiguous comments on the progress made, where it was reported China and the US have achieved consensus on some key issues including technology transfer, IP protection, non-tariff barriers, services, agriculture and trade balance; no specific details provided on these. US Press Secretary Sanders said the two parties had &quot;detailed and intensive discussions&quot; but &quot;much work remains&quot;; and went on to say that China trade discussions are to continue in Washington next week. US President Trump says there is a possibility that he will extend the China trade talks deadline; will not increase tariffs if China trade talks were extended. He also said that China talks are going extremely well, and the US is a lot closer than it has ever have been to having a real trade deal with China. Separately, the US submitted a draft reform to the WTO in which high income states, OECD members, G20 nations and any country with more 0.5% of world trade would not be eligible for special treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION:&nbsp;</strong>A sharp decline in motor assembly drove headline industrial production to post a surprise 0.6% decline in January. &quot;While this marks the second major downside surprise for the US economy, following the suspiciously weak retail sales report for December, we caution that most of the surprise came from a reversal in the volatile motor vehicles category,&quot; Oxford Economics said, pointing out that &quot;excluding autos, industrial production only slipped 0.2%. In addition, the 0.9% decline in manufacturing output comes on the back of a 0.8% rise in November.&quot; Looking ahead, Oxford Economics continues to expect slower momentum, &quot;but we caution against a recession bias as growth slows. Business surveys have softened amid headwinds from trade and political uncertainty, reduced fiscal stimulus, a stronger dollar. We see industrial production slowing to a 2% y/y pace by the end of 2019.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMPIRE MANUFACTURING: </strong>The February data saw an upside surprise, printing 8.8 from 3.9 (cons 7.00). &quot;This is a modest relief after the steep declines of the previous two months, but we can&rsquo;t be sure that it marks the bottom; the Chinese PMI data point clearly to further declines,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics said. The consultancy notes that the prices received index rose 9.8 points to 22.9, an eight-month high, despite the drop in oil prices. &quot;This is not definitive evidence of anything, but it bears watching over the next few months,&quot; Pantheon writes, adding &quot;overall, the survey is consistent with a clear slowdown in manufacturing, though not a recession in the sector. But we still expect to see further declines over the next few months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: </strong>The UoM sentiment index printed 95.5 in February, above the expected 93.7 and rising from January&rsquo;s 91.2. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics note, &ldquo;reports of the death of the consumer have been greatly exaggerated, and this report supports our view that the plunge in stock prices and the government shutdown were responsible for the drop in confidence in recent months.&rdquo; Expectations rose c. 6 points to 86.2, above the expected 84.5, with Pantheon saying they expect this to rise further going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Bostic (non-voter, dove) said he has no timeframe in mind for balance sheet normalisation, and once again reiterated his view for one rate hike in 2019. Fed&#39;s Daly (non-voter) says it is appropriate for the Fed to be patient; says no rate hikes needed in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) SETTLES $1.18 HIGHER AT $58.59/BBL; BRENT (J9) SETTLES $1.68 HIGHER AT $66.25. </strong>The energy complex extended gains on Friday continuing to be supported by ongoing optimism on the US and China front, where the two side appear to be getting closer to a deal, as well as the announced Saudi Arabia output cut. Brent prices printed a fresh new 2019 high at USD 65.84/bbl, the highest since OPEC+ supply cut announcement. Citi sees the move to surpass that level &ldquo;reinforced by a weekly close above that price, as likely to win broader market recognition that the cuts are working&rdquo;. In news commentary, India&#39;s January oil imports stood at USD 11.24bln, +3.59% yy. Also, the US has issued Venezuela-related sanctions targeting five individuals aligned with President Maduro, including Venezuela&#39;s Oil Minister Quevedo and the PDVSA Chief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.1% at 2775, NDX +0.5% at 7055, DJI +1.75% at 25883. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +1.6%, Materials +1.4%, Industrials +1.3%, Cons Discretionary +0.5%, Cons Staples +1.0%, Healthcare +1.5%, Financials +2.0%, Tech +0.8%, Telecoms +0.4%, Utilities +0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>NVIDIA (NVDA) opened higher after beating EPS and revenue estimates as well as raising its FY19 sales forecast. Newell Brands (NWL) nosedived on missing revenue estimates and guiding sales negative for 2019. Deere (DE) dipped on the open after a significant miss on its EPS estimate. Pepsi (PEP), Arista Networks (ANET), Moody&rsquo;s (MCO) and CBS (CBS) all traded higher after reporting their earnings. Conversely, Applied Materials (AMAT) and XPO Logistics (XPO) underperformed after disappointing earnings reports. FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) traded lower on the announcement Amazon (AMZN) was expanding its airline fleet to rely less on the shipping providers. Caesars (CZR) surged after activist investor Carl Icahn urged the co. to sell itself. Electronic Arts (EA) opened higher following reports it was in talks with Tencent to bring its new Apex Legends video game to China. Cowen upgraded Workday (WDAY) and downgraded Adobe (ADBE) causing them to rise and dip &ndash; respectively &ndash; on the open. Mattel (MAT) sunk after guiding FY19 sales flat in YY terms, gross sales to be lower. In M&amp;A, Nine senators urge regulators to reject T-Mobile (TMUS), Sprint (S) merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED -4 TICKS AT 122-01+.</strong> The T-Note gave back gains made in Asia trade to finish four ticks lower going into the holiday weekend, though most of the action through US trading was horizontal. ECB&rsquo;s Coeure hinted there could be further TLTROs in the pipeline, which saw the Bund tick lower, and the T-Note took its cue from that in thepre-market, before seeing positive ticks on soggy data. However, the UoM sentiment print was more positive, seeing the T-Note give up a couple of ticks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>A solid week for the Dollar overall, with a succession of new 2019 highs recorded above 97.000 and inching closer to last year&rsquo;s 97.711 peak, at 97.371. The Greenback did suffer a few data-related setbacks, namely due to significantly weaker than expected retail sales and industrial output, but met underlying bids not too far below the 97.000 handle on several positive factors. Reports of progress from high level talks between US and Chinese officials in Beijing, Friday&rsquo;s SOMA liquidity drain (2nd biggest so far at Usd23.3 bn), provisional agreement on US Government funding and the demise of certain counterpart currencies were all supportive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>Two of the aforementioned major losers, with Eur/Usd and Cable both sitting nearer the bottom of their weekly ranges (1.1235-1.1345 and 1.2770-1.2955 respectively), and the single currency dogged by more poor Eurozone data (like industrial production and GDP), downbeat/dovish ECB rhetoric (economic slowdown is stronger and broader than expected, inflation path will be shallower, new TLTRO is possible and the ECB are currently discussing it, per Coeure) and ongoing political issues (Spain calling a snap election for April 28 after the Government&rsquo;s 2019 budget was rejected, and Italy&rsquo;s Ruling League party lawmaker Borghi warning the country will have to exit the EU if May&rsquo;s elections do not result in changes). Meanwhile, the Pound continues to succumb to Brexit uncertainty after another crushing defeat for UK PM May in Parliament ahead of February 27&rsquo;s meaningful vote, while comments from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe yesterday were hardly helpful as he suggested that the MPC may be more inclined to cut rates rather than tighten if Britain left the EU without a deal. Note, however, Sterling did get some respite from a big retail sales beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another volatile week for the Loonie, with oil-powered gains helping the Cad to highs just over 1.3200 at one stage, but Canadian data somewhat disappointing to leave Usd/Cad not far from where it started on Monday circa 1.3275, albeit off the 1.3340 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>The renowned safe-havens have also endured a topsy-turvy time against the backdrop of fluctuating risk sentiment, as Usd/Jpy veered between 109.65 to 111.12 and the Franc flitted from 1.0098 to 0.9986. The former eventually breached strong barrier defences and Japanese exporter offers at 111.00 to set a fresh ytd pinnacle, but then retreated through the big figure as US Treasury yields softened, while the latter plunged at the start of the week when trading conditions were thin due to Japan&rsquo;s National Foundation Day holiday and stops were triggered amidst market talk of a fat finger trade that subsequently drew in algos and other model orders. Usd/Jpy now around 110.50 and Usd/Chf gyrating around 1.0050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>The Kiwi has won the battle down under as Nzd/Usd sits just shy of its 0.6865 high, but Aud/Usd retests support around 0.7100 and the cross trades nearer its 1.0363 low than 1.0545 high. The catalysts/drivers, a less dovish than anticipated hold from the RBNZ, with OCR tightening projections pushed back, but crucially no tweak up in easing probability despite recent weak NZ data. Note also, Governor or and the Board maintained guidance for the next move to be a hike or cut and formerly adopted a dual policy mandate. Conversely, RBA&rsquo;s Kent effectively welcomed Aussie depreciation as the domestic economy still has spare capacity and inflation is low, following a more dovish/downbeat shift from Governor Lowe last week and bleaker growth forecasts in the SOMP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>Like their Antipodean peers, the Scandi Crowns have tussled for supremacy as Eur/Nok traded in a 9.8410-7335 band and Eur/Sek saw 10.5245-4010 parameters, but with the Nok emerging as the front-runner on the strong rebound in oil prices and bullish or less bearish technical. Note, the first Riksbank policy meeting of the year came with a less dovish/more upbeat statement than many forecast (maintained repo rise guidance for H2 based on stronger domestic fundamentals vs weaker externals and heightened international risks), but only gave the Sek a brief/modest boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Marked underperformance vs the Usd in regional currencies, and especially for the Rouble on latest Russian sanctions, Rand due to ongoing Eskom issues and the Lira post sub-consensus Turkish data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> Tuesday: UK Labour Market Report, RBA Minutes, German ZEW Survey, Japan Trade Balance Wednesday: FOMC Minutes, US Housing Starts, US Building Permits, Eurozone Consumer Confidence (Flash) Thursday: ECB Mins, Aussie Labour Report, Philly Fed, US Existing Home Sales, US &amp; Eurozone Markit Flash PMIs, Japan CPI Friday: Eurozone CPI (Final), Riksbank Minutes. <a href=\"https://portal.ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21188/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Central Bank Weekly: </strong>Previewing minutes from FOMC, ECB, RBA ; reviewing Riksbank, RBNZ. <a href=\"https://portal.ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21187/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: divergent CB vibes, another Brexit defeat, but US-China trade talks productive",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid week for the Dollar overall, with a succession of new 2019 highs recorded above 97.000 and inching closer to last year&rsquo;s 97.711 peak, at 97.371. The Greenback did suffer a few data-related setbacks, namely due to significantly weaker than expected retail sales and industrial output, but met underlying bids not too far below the 97.000 handle on several positive factors. Reports of progress from high level talks between US and Chinese officials in Beijing, Friday&rsquo;s SOMA liquidity drain (2nd biggest so far at Usd23.3 bn), provisional agreement on US Government funding and the demise of certain counterpart currencies were all supportive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the aforementioned major losers, with Eur/Usd and Cable both sitting nearer the bottom of their weekly ranges (1.1235-1.1345 and 1.2770-1.2955 respectively), and the single currency dogged by more poor Eurozone data (like industrial production and GDP), downbeat/dovish ECB rhetoric (economic slowdown is stronger and broader than expected, inflation path will be shallower, new TLTRO is possible and the ECB are currently discussing it, per Coeure) and ongoing political issues (Spain calling a snap election for April 28 after the Government&rsquo;s 2019 budget was rejected, and Italy&rsquo;s Ruling League party lawmaker Borghi warning the country will have to exit the EU if May&rsquo;s elections do not result in changes). Meanwhile, the Pound continues to succumb to Brexit uncertainty after another crushing defeat for UK PM May in Parliament ahead of February 27&rsquo;s meaningful vote, while comments from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe yesterday were hardly helpful as he suggested that the MPC may be more inclined to cut rates rather than tighten if Britain left the EU without a deal. Note, however, Sterling did get some respite from a big retail sales beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another volatile week for the Loonie, with oil-powered gains helping the Cad to highs just over 1.3200 at one stage, but Canadian data somewhat disappointing to leave Usd/Cad not far from where it started on Monday circa 1.3275, albeit off the 1.3340 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renowned safe-havens have also endured a topsy-turvy time against the backdrop of fluctuating risk sentiment, as Usd/Jpy veered between 109.65 to 111.12 and the Franc flitted from 1.0098 to 0.9986. The former eventually breached strong barrier defences and Japanese exporter offers at 111.00 to set a fresh ytd pinnacle, but then retreated through the big figure as US Treasury yields softened, while the latter plunged at the start of the week when trading conditions were thin due to Japan&rsquo;s National Foundation Day holiday and stops were triggered amidst market talk of a fat finger trade that subsequently drew in algos and other model orders. Usd/Jpy now around 110.50 and Usd/Chf gyrating around 1.0050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has won the battle down under as Nzd/Usd sits just shy of its 0.6865 high, but Aud/Usd retests support around 0.7100 and the cross trades nearer its 1.0363 low than 1.0545 high. The catalysts/drivers, a less dovish than anticipated hold from the RBNZ, with OCR tightening projections pushed back, but crucially no tweak up in easing probability despite recent weak NZ data. Note also, Governor or and the Board maintained guidance for the next move to be a hike or cut and formerly adopted a dual policy mandate. Conversely, RBA&rsquo;s Kent effectively welcomed Aussie depreciation as the domestic economy still has spare capacity and inflation is low, following a more dovish/downbeat shift from Governor Lowe last week and bleaker growth forecasts in the SOMP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like their Antipodean peers, the Scandi Crowns have tussled for supremacy as Eur/Nok traded in a 9.8410-7335 band and Eur/Sek saw 10.5245-4010 parameters, but with the Nok emerging as the front-runner on the strong rebound in oil prices and bullish or less bearish technical. Note, the first Riksbank policy meeting of the year came with a less dovish/more upbeat statement than many forecast (maintained repo rise guidance for H2 based on stronger domestic fundamentals vs weaker externals and heightened international risks), but only gave the Sek a brief/modest boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marked underperformance vs the Usd in regional currencies, and especially for the Rouble on latest Russian sanctions, Rand due to ongoing Eskom issues and the Lira post sub-consensus Turkish data.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Plenty in the mix around the early US data, but on that score alone the upbeat Empire State survey appears to have more than outweighed weak import/export prices. Gilts have now dipped under 124.00 to 123.97 and Bunds to 166.28 alongside US Treasuries, with the German benchmark also wary about a spirited recovery in Italian BTPs and Spanish Bonos on TLTRO talk. On that note, dovish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Couere amidst SOMA flows have compounded the bearish positional forces for Eur/Usd in particular to the extent that Thursday&rsquo;s circa 1.1250 low has been breached and a fresh multi-month base posted around 1.1235, closer to last year&rsquo;s 1.1216 trough. Conversely, the DXY has carved out a fresh 2019 peak at 97.371.</p>\r\n",

Other notable movers include, Vivendi (+7.6%) who are topping the Stoxx 600 following their earnings release and comments that Bollore is to step down from the Co&rsquo;s board in April. Separately, RBS (+1.3%) are in the green, following a beat on Q4 pre-tax operating profit and a special dividend for 2018. EDF (-4.6%) are near the bottom of the Stoxx 600, after their earnings release this morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Cable is back on the 1.2800 handle, albeit barely, and Eur/Gbp has slipped back towards 0.8800 in wake of a much bigger than forecast rebound in UK retail sales. However, Brexit remains at the fore and PM May suffered another heavy defeat in Parliament ahead of the next meaningful vote at the end of February, so the Pound is still prone to set-backs in the run up to March 29, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from Thursday&rsquo;s new 2019 high, and an even more pronounced reversal could bring big option expiries into play at the 110.00 strike (2.6 bn). The rationale, less euphoria/optimism on the US-China trade front as talks in Beijing ended on a promising note, but with core issues still unresolved and more negotiation now scheduled to take place in Washington next week as the clock ticks down to March 1&rsquo;s tariff deadline (unless that date is extended).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/AUD/EUR/CHF - All narrowly mixed against a relatively static Greenback, as the DXY nestles just above the 97.000 level, with the Loonie pivoting 1.3300 after yesterday&rsquo;s weak Canadian data trumped US retail sales, claims and PPI misses against the backdrop of stalling oil prices. Meanwhile, the Kiwi continues to outflank the Aussie down under, as Nzd/Usd hovers just below 0.6850 and Aud/Usd clings to 0.7100, with the cross sticking close to recent lows circa 1.0375. Note, comments from RBA&rsquo;s Kent hardly helped the Aud, as he essentially welcomed the weaker currency on the grounds that the domestic economy has slack and inflation is low. Elsewhere, the single currency remains heavy on rebounds through 1.1300 and also has hefty option expiry interest to contend with as 1 bn sits between 1.1250-60 and 1.3 bn from 1.1270-80, while SOMA positioning could add even more downside pressure, as today is the 2nd largest on record (Usd23.3 bn). The Franc is still meandering off recent lows within a tight 1.0070-50 range and equally restrained vs the Eur between 1.1355-35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a huge sell-off, but the post-UK retail sales decline in 10 year debt futures culminated in a marginal new session low (124.14, -16 ticks), with Bunds seemingly down in sympathy to 166.37 at worst (-17 ticks vs +10 ticks at the Eurex high) and in acknowledgment of a rebound in EU equities. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remained confined in narrow ranges, but with the curve flatter ahead of more top-tier data headlined by IP, but also including the more timely Michigan sentiment survey for the current month (preliminary release). Speaker-wise, another of the Fed&rsquo;s dovish-leaning members, but current non-voter, as Bostic follows Brainard yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) are firmer as markets received updates on US-China trade talks, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, while recent reports indicate that talks have concluded. Despite being firmer, prices are off session highs with Brent slipping back below USD 65.0/bbl after moving past this level for the first time this year earlier in the session Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia has suspended production at its Safaniyah offshore oilfield which is the world&rsquo;s largest offshore oilfield with a capacity of up to 1.5mln BPD; production may be suspended until March. However, this is not expected to significantly impact Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s supply level, with Saudi Aramco subsequently confirming that their facilities, including this one, are safe and normal. Looking ahead we have the Baker Hughes Rig count which last week say total rigs increase by 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is largely unchanged in spite of the cautious risk environment and some dollar strength ahead of the 2nd largest SOMA day with USD 23.3bln of liquidity being drained. Elsewhere, Vale&rsquo;s CEO says that the miner&rsquo;s safety procedures have not worked; while researchers at World Mine Tailings Failures have stated that these events are becoming more frequent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is mulling further PDVSA sanctions as a next step against Venezuela&#39;s Maduro. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Aramco halted production from its heavy crude field in Safaniyah this week following a power cable accident and the stoppage to the field, which is the world&rsquo;s largest offshore field, could last until March.

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/21182/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities have drifter higher from the open [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.7%] amidst trade optimism between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies. Initial underperformance was experienced in the Dax (+0.4%) weighed on by the likes of Wirecard (-0.6%) alongside auto-names with Daimler (-0.5%), Volkswagen (-0.3%) and BMW (-0.8%) in the red following poor new EU27 car registrations data this morning, though optimistic trade developments somewhat supported sentiment. Both sides have expressed progress in talks, though dialogue is set to continue next week as not enough was agreed on to seal a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors are similarly mixed with some outperformance seen in telecom names, after Telecom Italia (+6.0%) are towards the top of the Stoxx 600 after Italy&rsquo;s state holding CDP said the board has authorisation to increase their stake to 10% in the next 12 months. Other notable movers include, Vivendi (+7.6%) who are topping the Stoxx 600 following their earnings release and comments that Bollore is to step down from the Co&rsquo;s board in April. Separately, RBS (+1.3%) are in the green, following a beat on Q4 pre-tax operating profit and a special dividend for 2018. EDF (-4.6%) are near the bottom of the Stoxx 600, after their earnings release this morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Cable is back on the 1.2800 handle, albeit barely, and Eur/Gbp has slipped back towards 0.8800 in wake of a much bigger than forecast rebound in UK retail sales. However, Brexit remains at the fore and PM May suffered another heavy defeat in Parliament ahead of the next meaningful vote at the end of February, so the Pound is still prone to set-backs in the run up to March 29, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from Thursday&rsquo;s new 2019 high, and an even more pronounced reversal could bring big option expiries into play at the 110.00 strike (2.6 bn). The rationale, less euphoria/optimism on the US-China trade front as talks in Beijing ended on a promising note, but with core issues still unresolved and more negotiation now scheduled to take place in Washington next week as the clock ticks down to March 1&rsquo;s tariff deadline (unless that date is extended).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD/EUR/CHF </strong>- All narrowly mixed against a relatively static Greenback, as the DXY nestles just above the 97.000 level, with the Loonie pivoting 1.3300 after yesterday&rsquo;s weak Canadian data trumped US retail sales, claims and PPI misses against the backdrop of stalling oil prices. Meanwhile, the Kiwi continues to outflank the Aussie down under, as Nzd/Usd hovers just below 0.6850 and Aud/Usd clings to 0.7100, with the cross sticking close to recent lows circa 1.0375. Note, comments from RBA&rsquo;s Kent hardly helped the Aud, as he essentially welcomed the weaker currency on the grounds that the domestic economy has slack and inflation is low. Elsewhere, the single currency remains heavy on rebounds through 1.1300 and also has hefty option expiry interest to contend with as 1 bn sits between 1.1250-60 and 1.3 bn from 1.1270-80, while SOMA positioning could add even more downside pressure, as today is the 2nd largest on record (Usd23.3 bn).

Despite being firmer, prices are off session highs with Brent slipping back below USD 65.0/bbl after moving past this level for the first time this year earlier in the session Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia has suspended production at its Safaniyah offshore oilfield which is the world&rsquo;s largest offshore oilfield with a capacity of up to 1.5mln BPD; production may be suspended until March. However, this is not expected to significantly impact Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s supply level, with Saudi Aramco subsequently confirming that their facilities, including this one, are safe and normal. Looking ahead we have the Baker Hughes Rig count which last week say total rigs increase by 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is largely unchanged in spite of the cautious risk environment and some dollar strength ahead of the 2nd largest SOMA day with USD 23.3bln of liquidity being drained.

        "content": "<p>After a week of consolidation and several downside forays, the 10 year German debt future looks set to venture higher again having recovered from an overnight downturn to 166.46 vs 166.55 at open and yesterday&rsquo;s 166.54 close. Bunds are currently just off a 166.64 peak, while the corresponding benchmark yield is flirting with 0.1% against the backdrop of waning risk sentiment following Thursday&rsquo;s batch of disappointing US data and latest reports on the US-China trade front suggesting that negotiations were amicable, but the 2 sides remain far apart on key issues. The latter has nullified if not overshadowed the relatively resounding US Senate and House votes in favour of the Government funding proposal, with core Eurozone bonds also deriving some support from a deeper retreat in peripheral paper. Technically, 166.70-73 forms the next resistance area before 166.83 and 166.96 ahead of 167.00, while support comes in around 166.42-38.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, the UK government Brexit motion was also defeated which would have given parliamentary backing for PM May&#39;s plan to seek changes to her Brexit deal.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s office said that due to the Labour party voting against the government, they are making a no-deal Brexit more likely, while it added that the government will continue to seek legally binding changes to the Irish backstop with the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested the message is that there is a majority for the Malthouse compromise, but government needs to work with its backbenchers rather than against them, according to The Telegraph&rsquo;s Political Editor.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were pressured as the risk averse tone spurred flows into the safe-haven JPY, while antipodeans were also softer due to their high-beta characteristics and after the miss on Chinese inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with trade in the complex mostly uneventful amid the frail appetite for risk.

The move in the 10-year was exacerbated by a block steepening trade where real money reportedly bought 18k+ TYH9, whilst selling 4k Ultra Bonds. However, dovish comments from Fed&rsquo;s Brainard, who mentioned curtailing the balance sheet normalisation process this year, and NEC Director Kudlow saying there were &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; in the retail sales figure were a headwind for treasury prices. Going into the close, the front-to-belly of the curve flattened, whilst the belly-to-long end of the curve steepened, with the 5s/30s steepening by c. 2.5bps. US T-note futures (H9) settled 13+ ticks higher at 122-05+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate voted 83-16 and US House voted 300-128 to pass the government funding and border security bill, which sends the bill to President Trump for signing.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly negative following the losses in US, where sentiment was dampened and growth concerns stoked by a surprise contraction in Retail Sales data which declined by the most in 9 years. Furthermore, participants are also wary due to events in Washington where Congress passed the government funding and border security bill, which President Trump is expected to sign but is also anticipated to declare a national emergency. This saw ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) open lower although the Australian benchmark has since recovered led by strength in telecoms and energy, while losses for Japanese exporters are exacerbated by a firmer currency. Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.5%) weakened after further PBoC inaction resulted to a liquidity drain of CNY 680bln for the week and as participants digest softer than expected CPI data, while ongoing trade talks further add to the cautious tone with US and China said to be far apart on reform demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are mostly quiet with the DXY relatively stable after having recovered to back above the 97.00 level, while its counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD backing further away from resistance around 1.3000 and with GBP/USD below 1.2800 in the aftermath of another government defeat in parliament in which MPs rejected PM May&rsquo;s motion by 303 votes to 258. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are pressured as the risk averse tone spurs flows into the safe-haven JPY, while antipodeans are also softer due to their high-beta characteristics and after the Chinese inflation miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs track the recent gains in T-notes as the risk averse tone spurs a flight to quality, while focus turns to the 10yr inflation-indexed auction later.</p>\r\n",
