        "content": "<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is expected to keep policy unchanged at its semi-annual policy today by maintaining the current appreciation rate or slope of the SGD Nominal Effective Exchange Rate. The expectations for the MAS to keep policy unchanged follows the central bank’s back-to-back tightening steps in the 2 meetings during 2018, while inflation and growth data has also softened which effectively narrows the scope for further policy normalization.</p><p>As a guide, the MAS utilizes the exchange rate as its main policy tool in which it could tweak policy through either the mid-point, slope or width of the currency band. For example, the MAS could alter the mid-point of its SGD NEER band which if lowered, would effectively be easing policy by weakening the SGD against a basket of currencies. The central bank could also alter the slope of the trading band to adjust the path of the currency, which it did during the past 2 consecutive meetings in which it tightened policy by slightly increasing the slope of the currency band. Furthermore, the central bank could also widen the width of the trading band which would be seen as a neutral measure but would allow the currency more room to fluctuate.</p><p>The data from Singapore since the last meeting has weakened including 2018 annual GDP growth which slowed to 3.2% from 3.9% the prior year and with Q4 growth of 1.9% the weakest quarterly pace of expansion in more than 2 years, while core inflation also softened to 1.5% in February from 1.9% in December 2018. These figures therefore support the case for the central bank to hold off on further policy adjustments considering it had cited a steady expansion path for the economy and upward pressures to core inflation in its decision to tighten policy during the prior consecutive meetings. &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the recent dovish shifts among central banks, ongoing global slowdown concerns and the US-China trade dispute are also factors which lessen the likelihood of tighter policy from the MAS. However, some have refused to rule out a continuation of normalization including Barclays who anticipate further FX policy tightening and the effects of weak manufacturing in Singapore to be counterbalanced by stronger construction and services sectors.</p><p>Today's announcement is due at 0100BST/1900CDT and will coincide with the release of Advanced GDP figures for Q1 (Q/Q Exp. 1.2%, Prev. 1.4%; Y/Y Exp. 1.5% Prev. 1.9%) although focus is likely to be centred on the policy announcement.</p>",

Inflation was \"muted\" and long-run inflation expectations are at the \"low end\" of range consistent with price stability, Clarida said. Later, Clarida said that the Fed does not see an elevated recession risk, and that the economy was in a good place. Clarida expects the most likely outcome is for global growth to rebound this year to prior normal levels, and that the tariffs which have been implemented so far have only had a modest impact on prices. On rates, Clarida reiterated a patient, data-dependent stance. Fed's Williams (Voter, neutral) says balance sheet normalisation has not fundamentally changed financial conditions; Williams sees 2% growth in 2019, and jobs market still has positive momentum; he reiterated that the Fed has scope to be patient and room to adjust monetary policy. Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dovish) said March FOMC marked end of policy normalization and warned that the FOMC should tread carefully to sustain US growth. Bullard said Fed can still adjust policy in response to data, and added that we need to take a sustained yield curve inversion seriously. Fed’s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) gave a wide-ranging interview where he stayed away from any market-moving themes; he said there was still slack in the labour market, and the Fed wants to see real wage growth; the Fed could keep rates low to help. Kashkari again criticised banks, suggesting they need more capital. Kashkari is also concerned about the yield curve signal, but doesn’t believe it necessarily causes recessions. On rates, he said we are close to neutral.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Following comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin last night, where he said that an agreement had been reached on an enforcement mechanism and the creation of enforcement offices, China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that both sides had been in discussions regarding outstanding issues and would maintain close communications. Reports soon emerged that China was to improve its offer to the US by opening its cloud-computing sector to overseas competition. There were also advances regarding the prospect of a transatlantic trade deal. News emerged that European governments had come to an agreement on the bloc’s negotiating mandate after France, who objects to the re-opening of trade talks with the US, announced that it would not block the opening of talks. EU ambassadors also reportedly approved talks with the US on the potential cutting of industrial tariffs. On the US-Canada trade front, Canadian Finance Minister Morneau stated that he expected the USMCA trade deal to be ratified shortly, despite some suggestion that on the US side the deal will be ‘dead on arrival’ in the house and senate.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB sources said policymakers are leaning towards offering a negative rate on TLTRO to banks that meet lending targets; also saying that policymakers are sceptical on a tiered deposit rate. <strong>ECB's Visco</strong> says he expects to have an assessment on the impact of negative rates in June, which will be part of the discussion on TLTRO terms. <strong>ECB's Knot</strong> stated that there is no need to discuss a recession in the Eurozone, adding that the fundamental conditions are in place for inflation to increase to the ECB's goal. Knott also said the terms of TLTRO-III need to be less generous than TLTRO-II.</p><p><strong>* IEA OIL REPORT:</strong> The IEA left its global oil demand growth unchanged at 1.3mln BPD for 2018 and 1.4mln BPD for 2019, adding that demand in China, India and the US is estimated to have grown by 1mln BPD in Jan-Feb 2019; this is in contrast to the EIA and OPEC which both cut their demand forecasts. The report also showed that OPEC crude oil production tumbled 550k BPD in March, to 30.1mln BPD, on further cuts from Saudi Arabia and steep losses in Venezuela, and that Saudi output dropped to its lowest in over two years, boosting compliance with supply cuts to 153%.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 1.03 LOWER AT USD 63.58/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLED USD 0.90 LOWER AT USD 70.83/BBL </strong>Crude prices<strong> </strong>dropped off on<strong> </strong>Thursday, with supply again dominating the market narrative. Sure to alarm bulls was the report that the OPEC June meeting is to hold a debate on raising oil output if crude hits USD 80-85/bbl, and Venezuela and Iran supply falls further. Weak volume has also resulted in some choppy price action across asset classes, where analysts at Citi note it as “a tacit acknowledgement that Wednesday’s DOE data for the week ended April 5 was more mixed than clearly bullish, with a build in crude oil helping to offset the drop in gasoline inventories.” Further adding, “Gasoline prices have also softened, suggesting that some traders considered Wednesday’s rally overdone.” However, oil prices are still green for the week, with the ongoing geopolitical risk premium still applying, as rising tensions in Libya and Iran still overhang the energy markets.</p><p><strong>* SPX 0.0% at 2888, NDX -0.2% at 7595, DJI -0.1% at 26142.

The buck was also supported by yield-differentials, and the broad bid remains as we head into APAC trade. There was nothing particularly new in Thursday’s Fedspeak. Aforementioned yield differentials were to the detriment of JPY, and comments from BOJ’s Kuroda were ho hum. GBP traders began the day continuing to price out a no-deal Brexit towards no exit, though the pound couldn’t cling on to gains in the face of USD strength. After the Debelle-induced short squeeze this week, AUD eased, with some citing rate differentials again, while lower oil, iron-ore and copper were lower, giving bears ammo.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities down, dollar up, Treasuries down, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> US/China trade deal edges closer; ECB leaning towards negative TLTRO rates; IEA oil report shows demand unchanged</p><p><strong>* AHEAD:</strong> EZ Industrial Production; US Import/Export Prices; University of Michigan (Preliminary); Chinese Trade Balance; ECB's Weidmann &amp; Praet; BoE's Carney; Earnings from: JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo &amp; PNC Financial</p><p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>A new cyclical low for the second straight week, giving us the first reading beneath 200k since 1969. ”This is remarkable given the downshift in economic growth since last summer’s peak,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “and it suggests that the extreme difficulty firms report in finding staff is raising the bar for layoffs.” The consultancy also says that it is possible that seasonal adjustment problems are responsible for some or all of the latest drop, “but it appears to suggest that the labour market continues to tighten,” and adds that “as labour becomes more scarce, it will become more expensive too.”</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Clarida (neutral, voter) reiterated a \"patient\" stance, and that there were signs of US economy slowing from a \"robust pace\" last year. Inflation was \"muted\" and long-run inflation expectations are at the \"low end\" of range consistent with price stability, Clarida said. Later, Clarida said that the Fed does not see an elevated recession risk, and that the economy was in a good place. Clarida expects the most likely outcome is for global growth to rebound this year to prior normal levels, and that the tariffs which have been implemented so far have only had a modest impact on prices. On rates, Clarida reiterated a patient, data-dependent stance. Fed's Williams (Voter, neutral) says balance sheet normalisation has not fundamentally changed financial conditions; Williams sees 2% growth in 2019, and jobs market still has positive momentum; he reiterated that the Fed has scope to be patient and room to adjust monetary policy. Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dovish) said March FOMC marked end of policy normalization and warned that the FOMC should tread carefully to sustain US growth. Bullard said Fed can still adjust policy in response to data, and added that we need to take a sustained yield curve inversion seriously. Fed’s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) gave a wide-ranging interview where he stayed away from any market-moving themes; he said there was still slack in the labour market, and the Fed wants to see real wage growth; the Fed could keep rates low to help. Kashkari again criticised banks, suggesting they need more capital. Kashkari is also concerned about the yield curve signal, but doesn’t believe it necessarily causes recessions. On rates, he said we are close to neutral.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Following comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin last night, where he said that an agreement had been reached on an enforcement mechanism and the creation of enforcement offices, China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that both sides had been in discussions regarding outstanding issues and would maintain close communications. Reports soon emerged that China was to improve its offer to the US by opening its cloud-computing sector to overseas competition. There were also advances regarding the prospect of a transatlantic trade deal. News emerged that European governments had come to an agreement on the bloc’s negotiating mandate after France, who objects to the re-opening of trade talks with the US, announced that it would not block the opening of talks. EU ambassadors also reportedly approved talks with the US on the potential cutting of industrial tariffs. On the US-Canada trade front, Canadian Finance Minister Morneau stated that he expected the USMCA trade deal to be ratified shortly, despite some suggestion that on the US side the deal will be ‘dead on arrival’ in the house and senate.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB sources said policymakers are leaning towards offering a negative rate on TLTRO to banks that meet lending targets; also saying that policymakers are sceptical on a tiered deposit rate. <strong>ECB's Visco</strong> says he expects to have an assessment on the impact of negative rates in June, which will be part of the discussion on TLTRO terms. <strong>ECB's Knot</strong> stated that there is no need to discuss a recession in the Eurozone, adding that the fundamental conditions are in place for inflation to increase to the ECB's goal. Knott also said the terms of TLTRO-III need to be less generous than TLTRO-II.</p><p><strong>* IEA OIL REPORT:</strong> The IEA left its global oil demand growth unchanged at 1.3mln BPD for 2018 and 1.4mln BPD for 2019, adding that demand in China, India and the US is estimated to have grown by 1mln BPD in Jan-Feb 2019; this is in contrast to the EIA and OPEC which both cut their demand forecasts. The report also showed that OPEC crude oil production tumbled 550k BPD in March, to 30.1mln BPD, on further cuts from Saudi Arabia and steep losses in Venezuela, and that Saudi output dropped to its lowest in over two years, boosting compliance with supply cuts to 153%.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 1.03 LOWER AT USD 63.58/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLED USD 0.90 LOWER AT USD 70.83/BBL </strong>Crude prices<strong> </strong>dropped off on<strong> </strong>Thursday, with supply again dominating the market narrative. Sure to alarm bulls was the report that the OPEC June meeting is to hold a debate on raising oil output if crude hits USD 80-85/bbl, and Venezuela and Iran supply falls further. Weak volume has also resulted in some choppy price action across asset classes, where analysts at Citi note it as “a tacit acknowledgement that Wednesday’s DOE data for the week ended April 5 was more mixed than clearly bullish, with a build in crude oil helping to offset the drop in gasoline inventories.” Further adding, “Gasoline prices have also softened, suggesting that some traders considered Wednesday’s rally overdone.” However, oil prices are still green for the week, with the ongoing geopolitical risk premium still applying, as rising tensions in Libya and Iran still overhang the energy markets.</p><p><strong>* SPX 0.0% at 2888, NDX -0.2% at 7595, DJI -0.1% at 26142. SECTORS: Communications +0.1%, Cons Discretionary +0.1%, Cons Staples +0.1%, Energy 0.0%, Financials +0.6%, Healthcare -1.2%, Industrials +0.9%, Materials -0.1%, Tech -0.1%, Telecoms +0.2%, Utilities +0.6%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) shares moved higher throughout the session after news emerged that the streaming co. is to launch a free magazine in June that would promote its content. Tesla (TSLA) shares dipped following premarket rumours surfaced that the electric carmaker’s joint plans with Panasonic had been frozen. Monster Beverage Corp (MNST) shares dropped after news emerged that Amazon (AMZN) was to launch a rival energy drink product. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (KDP) shares dropped after a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) shares slid on disappointing sales from its earnings report, whilst its activist investors expressed their distaste for its management. UnitedHealth (UNH) shares were hit by a price target cut from BMO. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) traded lower after it was revealed that March same-store sales missed street expectations. Weight Watchers International (WTW) shares fell after JP Morgan Chase announced they saw downside risk to the food makers 2019 profit guidance and cut their price target. Caesar Entertainment Corp (CZR) shares traded higher on reports that the firm is looking to put itself up for sale as soon as this week. US Steel Corp (X) shares fell after the steel maker was downgraded twice by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, stock price falling to a two and a half year low. Fastenal Co (FAST) shares jumped in premarket trading as Q1 profits beat expectations in spite of unfavourable weather conditions.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 7+ LOWER AT 123-18. </strong>The implied probability for a Fed rate cut in 2019 fell to sub-50%, from around 55% on Wednesday, after decent jobless claims data and an upside surprise to PPI. However, ranges were low, and volumes were hardly exciting. Fed speakers added little new to the narrative, generally reiterating current positions and the central bank’s neutral stance (in line with yesterday’s minutes). This week’s auction series have been mixed, and after a solid 10-year sale on Wednesday, which stopped through by 1bps, Thursday’s sale of 30s was ok, tailing by 0.6bps, though direct participation fell slightly, picked-up by the indirects. At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch wider.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> USD buoyed by decent weekly claims data, while PPI was slightly firmer than expected. The buck was also supported by yield-differentials, and the broad bid remains as we head into APAC trade. There was nothing particularly new in Thursday’s Fedspeak. Aforementioned yield differentials were to the detriment of JPY, and comments from BOJ’s Kuroda were ho hum. GBP traders began the day continuing to price out a no-deal Brexit towards no exit, though the pound couldn’t cling on to gains in the face of USD strength. After the Debelle-induced short squeeze this week, AUD eased, with some citing rate differentials again, while lower oil, iron-ore and copper were lower, giving bears ammo.</p>",

Sure to alarm bulls was the report that the OPEC June meeting is to hold a debate on raising oil output if crude hits USD 80-85/bbl, and Venezuela and Iran supply falls further. Weak volume has also resulted in some choppy price action across asset classes, where analysts at Citi note it as “a tacit acknowledgement that Wednesday’s DOE data for the week ended April 5 was more mixed than clearly bullish, with a build in crude oil helping to offset the drop in gasoline inventories.” Further adding, “Gasoline prices have also softened, suggesting that some traders considered Wednesday’s rally overdone.” However, oil prices are still green for the week, with the ongoing geopolitical risk premium still applying, as rising tensions in Libya and Iran still overhang the energy markets.</p><p><strong>* IEA OIL REPORT:</strong> The IEA left its global oil demand growth unchanged at 1.3mln BPD for 2018 and 1.4mln BPD for 2019, adding that demand in China, India and the US is estimated to have grown by 1mln BPD in Jan-Feb 2019; this is in contrast to the EIA and OPEC which both cut their demand forecasts. The report also showed that OPEC crude oil production tumbled 550k BPD in March, to 30.1mln BPD, on further cuts from Saudi Arabia and steep losses in Venezuela, and that Saudi output dropped to its lowest in over two years, boosting compliance with supply cuts to 153%.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong>&nbsp;The US Treasury will this week auction USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tue), 10-year (USD 24bln, Wed) and30-year (USD 16bln, Thu). With USD 77.8bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise around USD 200mln in new cash, according to TD Securities. The bank adds that with USD 180mln maturing on the Fed's balance sheet, there will be nearly no add-ons at mid-month settlement.</p><p><strong>* RECENT AUCTIONS:</strong>&nbsp;Have generally performed well, with investors piling into havens at the beginning of the year amid the market uncertainty. While market pricing remains elevated (around 50% chance of a rate cut by the end of the year), it has backed off from extremes. TD Securities expects that, with the Fed's balance sheet run-off ending in October, the bank expects the Treasury to cut auction sizes in the 2-year to 3-year sector, which could support demand at the front-end.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong>&nbsp;The February auction saw the lowest yield at a 30s auction since July 2018, though cover slipped versus the previous month. Analysts at SocGen note that current 30s are trading fair in asset swap from a relative value perspective, but the 5s30s has flattened form multi-month highs at the end of March. The bank also says that the WI is trading beneath all of the 30-year auction stop-out rates since January 2018, which could be a negative factor leading to poor takedown. However, it does say that the current 30 trades rich in repo, which could offset negative factors, and accordingly, it holds a slight negative bias going into the auction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/b98a838b-b851-4fb2-9c3d-e71697bd505e.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback gleaned some traction and support from FOMC minutes underscoring a neutral stance and no bias towards an ease after the current pause and patient period ends. However, the DXY got an extra push amidst broader Dollar gains to extend its recovery to 97.137 from 96.866 and lower ahead of the aforementioned Fed release on the back of forecast-beating data in the form of PPI and weekly claims, along with upbeat live Fed commentary from Clarida and Williams vs usual dovish rhetoric via Bullard.</p><p><strong>CAD/TRY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Lira are propping up their respective major and minor leagues, as the former also had to contend with softer oil prices alongside its US counterpart’s revival. Usd/Cad extended through offers between 1.3360-75 to just shy of 1.3400, but faded ahead of more supply said to be sitting above the big figure. Meanwhile, the Try failed to draw any comfort from smaller than expected current account or trade shortfalls, not to mention cheaper crude with another decline vs the Usd to 5.7550+ at one stage amidst the ongoing dispute over local election results and tensions with the US over F-35 jets and S-400 Russian missiles.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/JPY</strong></p><p>The next weakest G10 links and losers against the US Dollar as the Aussie and Kiwi both retreated further from best levels through 0.7150 and 0.6750 respectively, with Aud/Usd getting dragged towards 1 bn expiry options at the 0.7100 strike, but not really close before the NY cut, while Nzd/Usd tested the 200 DMA circa 0.6730. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy continued its rebound from sub-111.00 lows and temporary breach of support ahead of the 55 DMA (at 110.84 vs 110.75), but stop a few pips short of the 200 DMA (111.50) after clearing 1.7 bn expiries between 110.85-111.05 well before rollover time.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All ending a volatile EU session narrowly mixed vs the Buck, as the Franc recovered some lost ground within a wider/higher range of 1.0011-46, while Cable managed to hold above 1.3050 and Eur/Gbp meandered between 0.8602-34, just evading the bottom end of 1.4 bn expiries from 0.8600 to 0.8610. The Pound was cushioned or relieved by the latest Brexit delay that averts no deal tomorrow and extends A 50 beyond May 22 to October 31, or sooner if UK Parliament can muster a withdrawal deal that the EU ratifies. However, the single currency also displayed resilience and survived a test of chart support at the 100 HMA (1.1254-56) to inch back up towards 1.1290 highs with the aid of ECB remarks downplaying recession risks and the growth slowdown.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Nok rebounded from yesterday’s post-Norwegian inflation data lows amidst the retreat in oil to 9.6050+, but Eur/Sek was capped within a 10.4580-4180 band on the back of Swedish CPI showing firmer than forecast headline and core readings, y/y and m/m respectively.</p>",

Hang Seng (-0.9%) fell below the psychological 30k level and Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) underperformed following somewhat inconclusive inflation data from China and as money market rates increased amid continued PBoC inaction. Comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin also failed to inspire even though he noted that talks with China were very productive and that an enforcement mechanism had been agreed, as he also suggested there were still important issues to address. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued after a pullback from the 153.00 level and amid lacklustre trade in T-notes, while stronger demand at today’s enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds (20s, 30s, 40s) also did little to underpin demand for the 10yr.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Furthermore, the deal will be subject to a review on June 21st to ensure the UK’s behaviour is in-fitting with the terms of the deal after it elects MEPs.

France’s CAC 40 (+0.6%) is the marked outperformer as the index is bolstered by Sodexo (+5.0%) and LVMH (+4.6%) amid optimistic earnings. Sector-wise, consumer discretionary names lead the gains as the upbeat numbers from LVMH lifted fellow luxury names in sympathy with Swatch (+3.0%), Richemont (+1.7%), Kering (+1.8%) and EssilorLuxoticca (+2.0%) all benefiting from the tailwind. Meanwhile, utilities lag after reports that Ofgem are introducing new tougher entry tests from June 2019 for suppliers entering the market.In terms of individual movers, Prysmian (-8.6%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. said it could see a potential impact of EUR 60-80mln from issues regarding Western Link high voltage cable and damage claims. In terms of bank commentary, analysts at Citi now forecast 2% gains in global equities over the rest of the year, adding that their bear market checklist suggests buying into the next dip. However, Citi notes that the main risk to their forecast remains a full-blown global recession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>CAD/AUD/NZD - Fall-out from the latest Fed minutes, which were less dovish than some anticipated, has been more pronounced across the commodity bloc where the high beta currencies are particularly sensitive/prone to swings in risk sentiment and underlying prices. The Loonie has lost most ground vs its US counterpart within a 1.3313-57 range as crude prices retreat from fresh 2019 peaks, closely followed by the Aussie and then the Kiwi that have both topped out after extending gains overnight and are retesting support/bids around 0.7150 and 0.6750 respectively.</p><p>JPY/GBP - Also losing out to a broadly firmer Usd post-FOMC minutes, as the DXY nudges back up towards the 97.000 axis, with Usd/Jpy also bouncing off the 200 DMA (110.90) and a little beyond the top end of hefty option expiries (1.7 bn) straddling the 111.00 level from 110.85 to 111.05 that could yet keep the topside in check ahead of 111.20. Meanwhile, Cable remains top heavy around or just above 1.3100 where short term chart resistance resides, and Eur/Gbp is still supported circa 0.8600 even though the EU has afforded Britain a longer A 50 extension and thereby prevented a Friday or May 22nd no deal Brexit. Note also, 1.4 bn expiries between 0.8600-10 may underpin the cross over the NY cut.</p><p>CHF/EUR - The Franc and single currency are holding up relatively well against the recovering Greenback, with Usd/Chf slipping back from multi-week highs towards parity and Eur/Usd reversing all and a bit more of its post-dovish ECB declines to revisit technical resistance protecting 1.1300.</p><p>SEK/NOK - The Swedish Krona has picked up the inflation baton from its Scandi peer in wake of Swedish CPI metrics that saw headline y/y rate and core m/m rates eclipse consensus. Eur/Sek slipped below 10.4200 in response, but has rebounded since, while Eur/Nok is also consolidating off Wednesday’s post-Norwegian inflation lows around 9.5800.</p><p>EM - The Lira’s woes simply go on, and regardless of Turkish data that should be supportive, such as narrower current account and trade deficits or a rise in weekly reserves. Instead domestic and geopolitical angst continues to trouble Try investors and the reaction to yesterday’s economic plan remains underwhelming. Hence, Usd/Try remains near the upper end of a 5.7300-6770 range.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bunds have pared losses from a slightly deeper 165.65 Eurex intraday base alongside an even firmer rebound in Eurozone peripheral paper after multi-tranche Italian and Spanish auctions. However, Gilts are still closer to their Liffe lows that extended to 127.98 (-32 ticks) in wake of the 6 month Brextension and ahead of an official statement from UK PM May later, while US Treasuries are essentially flat amidst relatively tight overnight session parameters post-Fed minutes and pre-data including initial claims and PPI, plus the last leg of this week’s supply (Usd16 bn long bonds).</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>The oil complex remains lacklustre with upside in WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-0.8%)</strong> futures capped by the wider-than-forecast builds in crude inventories this week. The IEA Oil Market Report provided little impetus for the benchmarks, despite leaving global oil demand growth estimates unchanged whilst its OPEC and EIA counterparts downgraded the measure.&nbsp; However, the IEA and OPEC reports were relatively in-fitting in regard to OPEC output declining by over 500K BPD to just over 30mln BPD and both reports also highlighted that the slump in Venezuelan production led to the decline in global output.

France’s CAC 40 (+0.6%) is the marked outperformer as the index is bolstered by Sodexo (+5.0%) and LVMH (+4.6%) amid optimistic earnings. Sector-wise, consumer discretionary names lead the gains as the upbeat numbers from LVMH lifted fellow luxury names in sympathy with Swatch (+3.0%), Richemont (+1.7%), Kering (+1.8%) and EssilorLuxoticca (+2.0%) all benefiting from the tailwind. Meanwhile, utilities lag after reports that Ofgem are introducing new tougher entry tests from June 2019 for suppliers entering the market.In terms of individual movers, Prysmian (-8.6%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. said it could see a potential impact of EUR 60-80mln from issues regarding Western Link high voltage cable and damage claims. In terms of bank commentary, analysts at Citi now forecast 2% gains in global equities over the rest of the year, adding that their bear market checklist suggests buying into the next dip. However, Citi notes that the main risk to their forecast remains a full-blown global recession.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>CAD/AUD/NZD - Fall-out from the latest Fed minutes, which were less dovish than some anticipated, has been more pronounced across the commodity bloc where the high beta currencies are particularly sensitive/prone to swings in risk sentiment and underlying prices. The Loonie has lost most ground vs its US counterpart within a 1.3313-57 range as crude prices retreat from fresh 2019 peaks, closely followed by the Aussie and then the Kiwi that have both topped out after extending gains overnight and are retesting support/bids around 0.7150 and 0.6750 respectively.</p><p>JPY/GBP - Also losing out to a broadly firmer Usd post-FOMC minutes, as the DXY nudges back up towards the 97.000 axis, with Usd/Jpy also bouncing off the 200 DMA (110.90) and a little beyond the top end of hefty option expiries (1.7 bn) straddling the 111.00 level from 110.85 to 111.05 that could yet keep the topside in check ahead of 111.20. Meanwhile, Cable remains top heavy around or just above 1.3100 where short term chart resistance resides, and Eur/Gbp is still supported circa 0.8600 even though the EU has afforded Britain a longer A 50 extension and thereby prevented a Friday or May 22nd no deal Brexit. Note also, 1.4 bn expiries between 0.8600-10 may underpin the cross over the NY cut.</p><p>CHF/EUR - The Franc and single currency are holding up relatively well against the recovering Greenback, with Usd/Chf slipping back from multi-week highs towards parity and Eur/Usd reversing all and a bit more of its post-dovish ECB declines to revisit technical resistance protecting 1.1300.</p><p>SEK/NOK - The Swedish Krona has picked up the inflation baton from its Scandi peer in wake of Swedish CPI metrics that saw headline y/y rate and core m/m rates eclipse consensus. Eur/Sek slipped below 10.4200 in response, but has rebounded since, while Eur/Nok is also consolidating off Wednesday’s post-Norwegian inflation lows around 9.5800.</p><p>EM - The Lira’s woes simply go on, and regardless of Turkish data that should be supportive, such as narrower current account and trade deficits or a rise in weekly reserves. Instead domestic and geopolitical angst continues to trouble Try investors and the reaction to yesterday’s economic plan remains underwhelming. Hence, Usd/Try remains near the upper end of a 5.7300-6770 range.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bunds have pared losses from a slightly deeper 165.65 Eurex intraday base alongside an even firmer rebound in Eurozone peripheral paper after multi-tranche Italian and Spanish auctions. However, Gilts are still closer to their Liffe lows that extended to 127.98 (-32 ticks) in wake of the 6 month Brextension and ahead of an official statement from UK PM May later, while US Treasuries are essentially flat amidst relatively tight overnight session parameters post-Fed minutes and pre-data including initial claims and PPI, plus the last leg of this week’s supply (Usd16 bn long bonds).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The oil complex remains lacklustre with upside in <strong>WTI</strong> (-0.7%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (-0.8%) futures capped by the wider-than-forecast builds in crude inventories this week. The IEA Oil Market Report provided little impetus for the benchmarks, despite leaving global oil demand growth estimates unchanged whilst its OPEC and EIA counterparts downgraded the measure.&nbsp; However, the IEA and OPEC reports were relatively in-fitting in regard to OPEC output declining by over 500K BPD to just over 30mln BPD and both reports also highlighted that the slump in Venezuelan production led to the decline in global output. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> (-0.3%) remains just above the USD 1300/oz level after giving up breaching its 50 DMA to the downside (1307) as the Greenback recoups some of the pre-FOMC losses.

Meanwhile, another Brexit extension may not resolve any of the ongoing problems and if anything only prolongs the uncertainty, but as per the 1st push back March 29 the extra 6 months will be seen as an opportunity to formulate a deal and at the very least averts leaving the EU with no agreement as soon as tomorrow.

Indeed, the FOMC reinforced patience and a pause rather than potential easing, with some voters also retaining the option to hike again this year if inflation picks up and economic growth continues at a relatively solid pace. Looking ahead, no more Eurozone data on tap, but the ECB’s latest Survey of Professional Forecasters will be eyed at 8GMT.</p>",

(Newswires/FT)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>EU's Tusk announced that EU27 and UK have agreed to a flexible Brexit extension to October 31st</strong> which will give the UK an additional 6 months to find the best solution, while he added the extension is a little short of what he expected but still enough time to find the best solution and for the UK to not waste this time. <strong>There were also comments from Dutch PM Rutte that it is unlikely for Brexit to occur before June 30th</strong> and that it will be increasingly difficult to grant a further extension after October 31st. Furthermore, the deal will be subject to a review on June 21st to ensure the UK’s behaviour is in-fitting with the terms of the deal after it elects MEPs. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK PM May said she agreed to an extension to end-October at the latest and that she wants to leave the EU with a deal ASAP</strong>. May also noted the UK will not need to participate in EU elections if a deal can be ratified before May 22nd and that she will make a statement to Parliament today. Elsewhere, <strong>there were separate reports that UK PM May will seek to stay on as PM if Brexit deal is not passed by end-Jun</strong>. (Newswires/Guardian)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>UK Foreign Secretary Hunt said no-one knows if talks with Labour will solve impasse and that no-one in Tories wants to fight EU elections, while he also commented that a customs union will not work for a large economy like the UK.

(Newswires)</p><p>EU's Dombrovskis said EU is discussing trade issues with US and is hopeful the sides avoid an escalation of trade tensions, while Dombrovskis also noted they have seen some slowdown in the bloc's economies and that the Italian slowdown is partly due to government decisions. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ECB policymakers are in agreements that the Eurozone economy has held up in line with their March forecasts</strong>, despite recent disappointing economic metrics, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, price action was relatively quiet in which the <strong>DXY</strong> consolidated below the 97.00 level following the prior day’s central bank-triggered turbulence which began at the ECB after President Draghi’s bearish tone on the economy which in turn pressured <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong>. FOMC minutes stated that a majority of policy makers expected rates to remain steady this year and that the Fed's patient approach on rates is needed, while some policymakers even thought a modest hike could be warranted later this year. Elsewhere, <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> tested the 1.3100 level to the upside after the UK and EU27 agreed to a flexible Brexit extension to October 31st which averts the threat of crashing out without a deal on Friday, although upside was restricted as markets await the potential backlash PM May could receive from the hardline Brexiteers. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong> crosses attempted to nurse recent losses, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were lacklustre amid the uninspiring risk tone and inconclusive Chinese inflation data.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Commodities</strong> were lacklustre overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures slightly lower with prices constrained by resistance near its YTD highs and following the much larger than expected build in this week’s crude oil inventory reports, although prices remain above the USD 64.00/bbl level as threats to supply from the ongoing fighting in Libya, stems downside for oil. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was stable in the aftermath of an uneventful FOMC minutes and after the precious metal found a base at the USD 1300/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> prices reflected the broad risk averse sentiment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Libya National Oil Company said its Nageco unit was bombed outside of Tripoli.

(Yonhap/Asahi)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US</p><p>Decent IP data out of Europe helped the TPLEX find sellers in the premarket, though buyers emerged ahead of the US cash equity open. A mixed CPI report (headline up, core down) saw a chunky block in the TY June contract. After the data, ECB President Draghi’s reiteration of downside risks saw the T-note move in sympathy with the Bund, sending Treasuries to 1-week highs. There was a breather after the European cash close, where book squaring was reported ahead of the 10-year auction. The auction itself was fairly good, stopping through the screens by 1bps, while indirect bidder participation provided some encouragement. The Fed’s latest meeting minutes stuck to the script, though perhaps weren’t as dovish as some might have predicted after the outcome of the March policy meeting. That left major curve spreads mixed at settlement. US T-note futures (M9) settled 5 ticks higher at 123-25+.</p><p>US President Trump tweeted that it was too bad the EU is being so tough on the UK and Brexit, while he added that EU is likewise a brutal trading partner with the US which will change and suggested that sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it comes back to bite you.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were cautious as the region mulled over the prior day’s central bank activity from both sides of the Atlantic in which the ECB kept policy unchanged and repeated it expects rates to be kept at present levels through the end of 2019, while the FOMC minutes continued to suggest the Fed was firmly on pause. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) were subdued with Australia dampened by election risk after PM Morrison called for the election to be held on May 18th and with the ruling Coalition facing an uphill battle as it trails the opposition Labor Party by 52%-48% according to the latest polls, while risk appetite in Tokyo was hampered by recent currency flows in which USD/JPY briefly slipped below 111.00. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) fell below the psychological 30k level and Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) underperformed following somewhat inconclusive inflation data from China and as money market rates increased amid continued PBoC inaction. Comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin also failed to inspire even though he noted that talks with China were very productive and that an enforcement mechanism had been agreed, as he also suggested there were still important issues to address. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued after a pullback from the 153.00 level and amid lacklustre trade in T-notes, while stronger demand at today’s enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds (20s, 30s, 40s) also did little to underpin demand for the 10yr.</p>",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Indian elections to begin today",
        "content": "<p>India will begin its general election on April 11th to determine the 17th Lok Sabha (Lower House) and the next government of Asia’s 3rd largest economy. The elections for the 543 parliamentary seats is the world’s largest democratic election with around 900mln eligible voters and will be held over 7 stages until May 19th with the result due on May 23rd .</p><p>The surveys heading into the elections point to a continuation of the current government with the poll of polls (average of major opinion polls) suggesting PM Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies forming the National Democratic Alliance are likely to win 277 seats. This would be fewer than the 336 seats the coalition had received during the last election in 2014 and also less than the 282 seats the BJP Party achieved by itself, but would still be enough to get the ruling bloc past the 272 seats needed for a majority.</p><p>On the other side of the political battle is the Indian National Congress party (Congress) and its United Progressive Alliance which is led by Rahul Gandhi who comes from the nation’s most prominent political dynasty including a lineage of former Prime Ministers. The polls currently suggest Congress could win 88 seats which would be double the number it took during the abysmal performance at the last election of 44 seats which was below the 55 seats or 10% total required to be formally recognized as the Opposition party. Furthermore, the total number of seats for the UPA coalition is expected to jump to 138 from the previous 69 seats, while other parties are projected to win 128 seats.</p><p>A win by the BJP and its NDA partners is seen to be the most market friendly outcome as it would mean a continuation of the pro-business Modi government, especially if the BJP pull off another surprise clear majority on its own which boosted the Sensex to record highs last time around. As a reminder, the BJP’s election manifesto included 75 promises including a pledge to spend USD 1.44tln on infrastructure over the next 5 years, while it has also been relentless in its pressure on the RBI to support the economy. This includes the central bank delivering back-to-back rate cuts and also providing the government with a record dividend payment which helps ease the burden on borrowers and spur the economy, as well as dress up the government’s accounts heading into the election.</p><p>Conversely, a hung parliament would likely be the worst case scenario due to the political uncertainty and considering when this occurred in 1996 it resulted in India having 3 different Prime Ministers in 2 years before the lower house was dissolved early for fresh elections. The ruling party is also not without its challenges as it would have to overcome the anti-incumbent factor as well as criticism related to the demonetisation fiasco of 2016 which ended up strangling the economy and led to chaos due to the scarcity of cash. Many will also be annoyed at the ongoing jobs crisis in which unemployment recently hit its highest in 45 years. Furthermore, the state assembly elections held late last year in 5 states, which some view as an indicator for voting momentum for the upcoming general election, showed PM Modi’s BJP were overtaken by Congress in 3 of its stronghold states including Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgargh where it had been in control for 15 years.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are cautious with the region tentative as it mulls over the prior day’s central bank activity from both sides of the Atlantic in which the ECB kept policy unchanged and repeated it expects rates to be kept at present levels through the end of 2019, while the FOMC minutes continued to suggest the Fed was firmly on pause. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are lower with Australia dampened by election risk after PM Morrison called for the election to be held on May 18th and with the ruling Coalition facing an uphill battle as it trails the opposition Labor Party by 52%-48% according to the latest polls, while risk appetite in Tokyo has been hampered by recent currency flows which saw USD/JPY briefly slip below 111.00. Hang Seng (-1.0%) fell below the psychological 30k level and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) conformed to the overall downbeat tone in the region following somewhat inconclusive inflation data from China and continued PBoC inaction. Comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin also failed to inspire even though he noted that talks with China were very productive and that an enforcement mechanism had been agreed, as he also suggested there are still important issues to address.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is relatively quiet with the DXY consolidating below the 97.00 level following the prior day’s central bank-triggered turbulence which began at the ECB after President Draghi’s bearish tone on the economy which in turn pressured EUR/USD. However, the single currency later recovered after the dust settled as the ECB didn’t actually provide anything surprising and as President Draghi noted it was too early to discuss the terms of the TLTRO or decide tiering, while there was also some positioning heading into the FOMC minutes which turned out to be somewhat of an anti-climax as there was nothing to suggest that the central bank was on the brink of cutting rates. The minutes stated that a majority of policy makers expected rates to remain steady this year and that the Fed's patient approach on rates is needed, while some policymakers even thought a modest hike could be warranted later this year. Elsewhere, GBP/USD tests the 1.3100 level to the upside after the UK and EU27 agreed to a flexible Brexit extension to October 31st which avoids the threat of crashing out without a deal on Friday, although upside is restricted as markets await the potential backlash PM May could receive from the hardline Brexiteers. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses attempt to nurse recent losses, while antipodeans are lacklustre amid the uninspiring risk tone and inconclusive Chinese inflation data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued after a pullback from the 153.00 level and amid rangebound trade in T-notes with participants also sidelined ahead of enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>",
