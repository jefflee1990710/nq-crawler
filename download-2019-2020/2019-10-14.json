However, the positivity seen on Friday has been faded, as desks re-evaluate the optimism over US/China trade talks and challenges around the course for Brexit deal emerge. With that said, the usually hawkish Global Times editor has tried to explain away some of the differences in language used by the US/China over the weekend, while many Brexit watchers were never truly convinced that UK PM Johnson's plan would be able to fly in its current form. And then on the margin, geopolitics around Turkey/Syria have been at the forefront of traders’ minds. It has left us with an equity complex which is largely flat, T-Note futures higher (settling 11 ticks higher at 130-07, though off the pre-market highs seen after reports that China wanted more discussions before signing the phase one trade deal). The DXY is horizontal, keeping EUR and JPY largely lacklustre too. In terms of the outliers, GBP is lower as Brexit optimism fades from the frothy levels seen at the end of last week; AUD and NZD were said to be defensive on questions about the phase one deal; BRL eased amid dovish calls in the latest BCB economist poll; ZAR was softer as we await the 30th October D-day for Eskom, when the South African budget is due and will reveal the extent of aid earmarked for the utility company.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>Once again, the framing of the 'deal' reached at the tail-end of last week has come into question; the US has hailed it as 'Phase One' of a trade deal, while the Chinese are framing it as 'substantial progress' (state news did not even refer to a deal, stating that both sides \"agreed to make the efforts toward a final agreement\"). On Monday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin framed it as a “fundamental agreement in principle”. The differences in the framing was cited as one of the reasons why traders were cautious on Monday, amid thinner liquidity conditions due to the Columbus Holiday in the US, and Thanksgiving in Canada. Particularly since Bloomberg, citing sources, reported that China wanted more discussions before signing the ‘Phase One’ deal with US President Trump. China Global Times editor explained that “the initial statement of the Chinese side is moderate,” and that this was “China's habit,” and that it did not mean China's real attitude is not positive. However, the uncertainty has rekindled traders’ memories of previous rounds of trade negotiations, where much of the positivity is walked back on in weeks that have followed. CNBC reporter said that China felt phase one was not balanced, so wanted the US to take December tariffs off of the table before committing to the deal.</p><p><strong>* CHINA SEPTEMBER TRADE DATA: </strong>Disappointing data where China's trade surplus widened on the back of both imports and exports declining in September (exports -3.2% Y/Y vs consensus -2.8%; imports -8.5% Y/Y vs consensus -6.2%); the trade surplus with the US narrowed, though widened with other Asian nations, with some desks noting the tentative signs of improvement to the continent (but ex South Korea). Analysts said the data revealed the impact of trade wars as well as China's domestic slowing. The Phase One of the trade deal could help to reduce the US/China trade gap.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Fed's Kaplan</strong> (non-voter, dovish) urged patience and an open mind with regards to future policy moves; Kaplan toed the Fed line that T-Bill purchases were not QE, but a mere technical adjustment. Meanwhile, Fed’s Kashkari defended central bank independence in an Axios interview.</p><p><strong>* SYRIA/TURKEY: </strong>The<strong> </strong>US looks set to sanction Turkish individuals as soon as Monday amid Turkish President Erdogan declaring Turkish forces would not back down from their offensive against the Kurds in Northeast Syria. Following the US withdrawal from the region the Kurdish SDF has now gained the support of Assad’s Syrian Army – Russia has also said it has planned to “do something”. Over in Washington there has been bipartisan opposition to President Trump’s decision to withdraw US support, with politicians citing concern of a revival of terror groups such as ISIS and a need for tighter sanctions on Istanbul.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 1.11 LOWER AT USD 53.59/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 1.16 LOWER AT 59.35/BBL: </strong>The energy markets began the week on the back foot as participants became more wary on the “Phase one” trade deal announced on Friday. The increasing evidence of a less than certain “agreement” has bit into demand growth sentiment, reviving the challenging macro backdrop for oil participants. Productive OPEC supply updates did little to sway the price decline, but Russian Energy Minister Novak did reiterate Russia’s full commitment to the OPEC+ deal, adding that there were no discussions to alter the deal. The North Sea Buzzard oilfield (150k BPD) was reported to have resumed production following from prior reports there would be no timeline for resumption, providing more headwinds as the North Sea Forties crude stream regained its largest supply source. The latest Genscape forecast for Cushing stocks see the hub building 0.72mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Ahead of this week's EU summit, Brexit talk progress was limited over the weekend, with EU negotiator Barnier stating that \"a big gap\" remains over customs arrangements, with other EU sources suggesting a deal this week was unlikely. However, EU ambassadors were informed that the UK would make concessions on the plan for the Northern Irish border. UK PM Johnson's current plan is that N.Ireland will leave the EU customs union, and will therefore be treated the same as the rest of the UK, and to avoid a 'hard border', the UK would agree to enforce EU customs/tariffs rules on goods moving from the UK to N.Ireland, with a rebate system to compensate businesses; the EU side reportedly still needs convincing on how this would work in practice. The kicker is that sufficient progress has clearly not been made over the weekend, and for a deal to be signed-off by EU officials by the conclusion of the 17/18 October summit seems a high hurdle with a deal unlikely to be reached this week, EU sources suggested the summit is more likely to focus on an extension to January 31st, 2020 or later whilst there could also be a second special European Council before October-end; it is possible that talks will continue on Friday, after the EU summit has ended, and right up to UK Parliament's special sitting on Saturday, when lawmakers will decide whether requirements are in place to trigger the 'Benn Bill' (if no deal has been reached before 19th October, the government must ask EU for an A50 extension through January 2020). Desks highlight that even if PM Johnson strikes a deal, it would still need to get through parliament, where there have been some questions around the arithmetic, given that pro-Brexiteers and DUP members may be hostile to some of the concessions the government could potentially make.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> <strong>ECB hawk Holzmann</strong> described the ECB's loosening policy as 'wrong' and called for a temporary lowering of the inflation target to 1.5%. However, <strong>former ECB chief Trichet</strong> penned an op-ed defending the ECB's actions, and called for a three-pronged fiscal response (fiscal action in countries with room; structural reform by all EZ nations; dynamic wage growth in full-employment nations), warning that reliance on the ECB could not continue forever. <strong>ECB VP de Guindos</strong> said he does not forecast the Eurozone entering recession, but does expect very low growth for a longer period.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> <strong>BoE’s Ramsden</strong> said he did not have a rate direction bias, but argued that there was less spare capacity within the economy than he previously thought, which made the case for less accommodative monetary policy.<strong> BoE's Cunliffe </strong>says the economic outlook is weaker than we anticipated a year ago, reiterating that rate could move in either direction following a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -0.1% at 2966, NASDAQ-100 0% at 7842, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26787</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.1%, Consumer Staples -0.4%, Energy -0.1%, Financials 0.1%, Health Care 0%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology -0.1%, Materials -0.7%, Telecommunication Services -0.2%, Utilities -0.7%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) dropped on the open as copper prices took a hit from poor import/export data in China. In chipmakers, Xilinx (XLNX) and Western Digital (WDC) opened higher after upgrades at Nomura Instinet and Loop Capital, respectively. Nike (NKE) traded at the top of Dow with gratitude to an upgrade at BofAML. HP Enterprise (HPE) and Arconic (ARNC) both traded higher after upgrades at Evercore and Cowen, respectively. Beyond Meat (BYND) tumbled on the open amid a Market Perform initiation at Wells Fargo. IPG Photonics (IPGP) took a hit after Needham downgraded the electronic good manufacturer to Hold from Buy. Parsley Energy (PE) dives lower amid its defensive all-stock acquisition of Jagged Peak (JAG). Activision Blizzard (ATVI) weighed on tech as the videogame developer is estimated to take chunky losses in Revenue from its player boycott, Cowen analyst suggests. Tapestry (TPR) weighed on retailers amid a downgrade at UBS. AMD (AMD) caught tailwinds from a source report that Intel (INTC) could skip 10nm chips for desktop CPUs and instead offer 7nm desktop CPUs in 2022. Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) surged higher on reports that Apollo (APO) had bid close to USD 40/shr for it.</p>",

However, somewhat contrasting performances over the course of Monday’s EU session as Sterling managed to draw lines in the sand unlike the Lira that remained under pressure following bleak Turkish ip data and more sanction warnings from US President Trump and the EU. Cable initially extended its retreat from Friday’s 1.2700+ peak through 1.2600 and all the way down towards Fib support ahead of 1.2500 before turning almost full circle and retesting early highs circa 1.2650, while Eur/Gbp rotated around 100 pips from just over 0.8800 to the low 0.8700 area. Conversely, Usd/Try breached recent highs to register a new 5.9350+ multi-month apex and is now eyeing 5.9422 (Fib retracement) ahead of 5.9600, 6.0000 and perhaps even higher.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>All on the back foot vs their US peer amidst dwindling euphoria over Phase 1 of the trade pact between China and the US that was already waning before reports emerged that Beijing is seeking more talks before putting pen to paper and prior to Premier Li insisting that Chinese IP rights will be strictly protected. Usd/<strong>CNH</strong> rebounded from close to 7.0500, while Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd recoiled from 0.6335 and a tad above 0.6800 to lows of circa 0.6280 and 0.6750 respectively and Usd/Cad rebounded from sub-1.3200 to 1.3230, with the Loonie also lamenting weak oil prices as a function of less risk appetite. On that note, Eur/<strong>NOK</strong> meandered between 10.0160-10.0705 and mostly towards the upper end as the Norwegian Krona also acknowledged the softness in crude.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed and rangebound vs an equally subdued Dollar, as the <strong>DXY </strong>pivoted 98.500 in aimless holiday-thinned trade (US Columbus Day, Thanksgiving in Canada and Japan’s Health-Sports Day), but the Yen gave up safe-haven gains within 108.52-05 parameters and is now testing a key Fib level (108.43) and the Franc is back below 0.9950 and straddling 1.1000 against the Euro that remained contained between 1.1015-50 vs the Buck.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Real lost ground vs the Dollar amidst dovish calls in the latest BCB economist poll and also awaiting the October 30 D-day for Eskom when the SA budget is due and will reveal the extent of aid earmarked for the utility company. Usd/Brl hovering just shy of 4.1300.</p>",

Separately, the White House released the letter to US President Trump from Chinese President Xi which stated it is important we address each other’s concerns properly and make positive headway in other areas as well, while he called for working together to manage the differences on the basis of mutual respect. (Twitter/Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets began the week on the front-foot as the region reacted to last week’s announcement of a US-China Phase 1 deal</strong>, in which China agreed to make between USD 40bln-50bln of agricultural purchases from the US and the latter will refrain from implementing the October 15th tariffs. This spurred a relief rally for the majors across the region with the <strong>ASX 200 (+0.6%) </strong>led by the energy sector as Santos shares surged from a deal to buy assets from ConocoPhillips, although gold miners suffered after the precious metal retreated further below the USD 1500/oz level. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.8%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

Thus, the UK banking names and housebuilders underperform with substantial losses seen in RBS (-2.4%), Lloyds Banking Group (-3.2%) and Barratt Developments (-2.1%) who all rest at the bottom of the FTSE 100 (-0.5%). Broad-based losses are seen across all other major bourses. Turning to sectors, Materials and Financials underperform, with the former weighed on by a recoil in base metal prices and sentiment and the latter due to a lower-yield environment and the aforementioned Brexit jitters. Meanwhile, defensive sectors fare slightly better due to the overall risk aversion in the market. In terms of individual movers; Swiss heavyweight pharma names Roche (-1.6%) and Novartis (-1.7%) are subdued by source reports that the US is mulling tariffs on the Swiss pharma sector to narrow the US trade deficit with the country. Meanwhile, Daimler (-1.2%) shares are hit on reports that the Co. is to recall hundreds of thousands of Mercedes-Benz vehicles amid diesel emission issues. On the flip side, Spain’s Ferrovial (+1.0%) remains near the top of the Stoxx 600 index as it is reportedly to bid for Spanish railway concessions with French National Railway Company.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/AUD -</strong> The major underperformers after Friday’s arguably outsized and overextended gains on US-China trade and Irish border optimism or even hype, with latest Chinese trade data revealing weak internals and intensive weekend talks between the UK and EU not yielding positive results. Note also, latest reports suggest that China wants to discuss matters further with the US before signing off on Phase 1 of the deal agreed in principle last week. The Kiwi and Pound are propping up the G10 table, as Nzd/Usd slips back under 0.6300 and Cable retreats from just over 1.2705 towards 1.2550.

Thus, the UK banking names and housebuilders underperform with substantial losses seen in RBS (-2.4%), Lloyds Banking Group (-3.2%) and Barratt Developments (-2.1%) who all rest at the bottom of the FTSE 100 (-0.5%). Broad-based losses are seen across all other major bourses. Turning to sectors, Materials and Financials underperform, with the former weighed on by a recoil in base metal prices and sentiment and the latter due to a lower-yield environment and the aforementioned Brexit jitters. Meanwhile, defensive sectors fare slightly better due to the overall risk aversion in the market. In terms of individual movers; Swiss heavyweight pharma names Roche (-1.6%) and Novartis (-1.7%) are subdued by source reports that the US is mulling tariffs on the Swiss pharma sector to narrow the US trade deficit with the country. Meanwhile, Daimler (-1.2%) shares are hit on reports that the Co. is to recall hundreds of thousands of Mercedes-Benz vehicles amid diesel emission issues. On the flip side, Spain’s Ferrovial (+1.0%) remains near the top of the Stoxx 600 index as it is reportedly to bid for Spanish railway concessions with French National Railway Company.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>NZD/GBP/AUD - The major underperformers after Friday’s arguably outsized and overextended gains on US-China trade and Irish border optimism or even hype, with latest Chinese trade data revealing weak internals and intensive weekend talks between the UK and EU not yielding positive results. Note also, latest reports suggest that China wants to discuss matters further with the US before signing off on Phase 1 of the deal agreed in principle last week. The Kiwi and Pound are propping up the G10 table, as Nzd/Usd slips back under 0.6300 and Cable retreats from just over 1.2705 towards 1.2550. The Aussie has also relinquished big figure-plus status vs its US counterpart, but holding above 0.6750 amidst supportive Aud/Nzd crosswinds within a 1.0760-20 range.</p><p>NOK/SEK - Soft oil prices and another shift in the tech landscape alongside fading risk appetite is weighing on the Scandi Crowns, with Eur/Nok bouncing ahead of 10.0000 and Eur/Sek back up over 10.8500 awaiting more top tier Swedish data this week in the form of jobs on Thursday.</p><p>EUR/CAD/CHF/JPY - The Euro and Loonie are both sticking to relatively tight lines against the Greenback between 1.1015-50 and around 1.3200 respectively, but the single currency deriving some underlying support via marginally firmer than forecast Eurozone ip in contrast to the latter that is also having to contend with the decline in crude noted above.

Note also, latest reports suggest that China wants to discuss matters further with the US before signing off on Phase 1 of the deal agreed in principle last week. The Kiwi and Pound are propping up the G10 table, as Nzd/Usd slips back under 0.6300 and Cable retreats from just over 1.2705 towards 1.2550. The Aussie has also relinquished big figure-plus status vs its US counterpart, but holding above 0.6750 amidst supportive Aud/Nzd crosswinds within a 1.0760-20 range.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Soft oil prices and another shift in the tech landscape alongside fading risk appetite is weighing on the Scandi Crowns, with Eur/Nok bouncing ahead of 10.0000 and Eur/Sek back up over 10.8500 awaiting more top tier Swedish data this week in the form of jobs on Thursday.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Euro and Loonie are both sticking to relatively tight lines against the Greenback between 1.1015-50 and around 1.3200 respectively, but the single currency deriving some underlying support via marginally firmer than forecast Eurozone ip in contrast to the latter that is also having to contend with the decline in crude noted above. Meanwhile, the traditional safe-havens that were roundly shunned last week have regained some poise alongside Gold as the Yen pares losses from circa 108.50 to almost 108.00 and the Franc rebounds through 0.9950 and 1.1000 against the Euro even though latest Swiss sight deposit balances infer ongoing official activity aimed at curbing Chf demand. Back to Eur/Usd, decent option expiries may keep the headline pair in check, as 1.1 bn roll off between 1.0995-1.1000 vs 1.5 bn from 1.1090 to 1.1100.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira continues to depreciate and slumped to 4 month lows against the Buck near 5.9200 on a negative mix of investor concerns about Turkey’s offensive in Northern Syria and the consequences of military action, such as sanctions. Moreover, data has also undermined the Try with a steeper deceleration in ip adding to the case for further CBRT easing ahead of next Thursday’s policy meeting.</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia finds euphoria from the US-China Phase 1 agreement ",
        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week on the front-foot as the region reacts to last week’s late announcement of a Phase 1 deal between US and China which will take up to 5 weeks to get written, in which China agreed to make between USD 40bln-50bln of agricultural purchases from US and the latter will refrain from implementing the October 15th tariffs. This spurred a relief rally for the majors across the region with the ASX 200 (+0.7%) led by energy as Santos shares surged from a deal to buy assets from ConocoPhillips which is seen as materially accretive to EPS and with outperformance in tech on the trade developments, although gold miners suffered after the precious metal retreated further below the USD 1500/oz level. Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.5%) are also lifted by the euphoria from President Trump’s deal announcement and suggestion that the sides are close to ending the trade war, with further violent protests in Hong Kong as well as weaker than expected Chinese Exports and Imports figures, doing little to dent the mood for Chinese stocks. As a reminder, Nikkei 225 is closed as Japan observes Health-Sports Day.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer as safe-havens recover some of the recent lost ground triggered by the heightened US-China trade optimism and after its major counterpart EUR/USD failed to hold above the 1.1050 level. Furthermore, GBP/USD underperforms and gave up the 1.2600 handle as last week’s Brexit-related hopes begin to fade after the EU warned PM Johnson’s plans are not yet good enough to be the basis for an agreement and with Brussels demanding further Brexit concessions. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are subdued amid the absence of Japanese participants, while antipodeans are pressured following weak Chinese import numbers with losses in NZD/USD exacerbated as it tests 0.6300 to the downside and after AUD/NZD broke through resistance at 1.0750. SGD was also active overnight and actually strengthened despite a miss on GDP and the Monetary Authority of Singapore easing its FX-based policy by reducing the slope of its currency policy band, as some found solace that the nation averted a recession and given than there were outside calls for the MAS to completely remove its appreciation bias.</p>",
