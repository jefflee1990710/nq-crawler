(FB) moved initially higher after revenue and daily average users came in slightly higher than expectations; desks spoke optimistically of the co.’s efforts to monetise its Facebook Stories feature, however the co. finished the session in the red. S&amp;P 500 -0.5% at 3004, NASDAQ-100 -1% at 7930, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.5% at 27144.</p><p>T-Notes ended the day lower, alongside EGBs, after the ECB held rates and opened the door for accommodation, but not as immediate as some had expected. Prior to the ECB, Treasuries were taking their cues from the disappointing German July IFO survey, where Business Climate, Current Conditions, and Expectations all missed expectations. The T-plex spiked higher on the initial release of the ECB statement, before reversing course as participants seemingly read the lack of details on the upcoming APP and rate tiering system as less dovish then what some had expected. The selling was exacerbated by a strong US June Durable Goods report (2% vs. exp. 0.7%) and block selling, with some analysts attributing the sell-off in stocks and rates to risk parity funds. The trend failed to stop at the 7-year auction which tailed by a chunky 1.4bps, B/C at a multi-year low of 2.27x, and dealers taking a larger share than average. At settlement spreads were little changed with yields firmer across the entire curve between 3bps-4bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 7+ lower at 127-09.</p>",

The ECB held rates, whilst opening the door for future cuts, QE, and potentially a rate tiering system, but was rather scant on details, although market pricing for a 10bps September cut in the deposit rate is now above 90%. As the sell-off in Treasuries and EGBs extended, the dollar firmed against the euro, and more generally, with some analysts noting risk parity funds as a main driver of dollar strength on the day, particularly against the euro, rotating out of stocks, bonds and metals.</p><p><strong>* ECB REVIEW: </strong>As forecast by consensus, policymakers opted to stand pat on rates and thus refrained from lowering the deposit rate, despite market pricing leaning towards such a move ahead of the meeting (53% chance of a cut, pre-announcement). However, the Bank paved the way for an eventual rate cut by tweaking its forward guidance on rates to include an “or lower” option and as such, markets now price in a 93% chance of a 10bps rate cut at the September meeting. Other dovish elements to the policy statement included the Governing Council tasking the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, the design of a tiered rate system, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases. This sentiment was also reinforced by the statement highlighting the need for “a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time”. During the press conference, Draghi’s assessment of the Eurozone economy showed that softening growth dynamics and muted inflationary pressures are hampering the region, and thus risks surrounding the Euro Area’s outlook remain classified as “titled to the downside”. The ECB President also went on to suggest that a rebound in the second half of the year looks “less likely” with the outlook looking “worse and worse”. However, markets proceeded to reverse course from their initial dovish take from the 1245BST announcement as Draghi rebuffed questions regarding the unanimity of today’s policy adjustments. Instead, Draghi suggested there was a broad discussion with \"broad convergence\" to the decision whilst noting that some board members had reservations about a two-tiered rate system. Furthermore, it was revealed that no discussion took place this week on an imminent rate cut or the size of such a prospective move. Overall, it appears that the potential policy 'bazooka' that some in the market had been looking for might not necessarily be on its way, with the ECB President keen to stress the optionality in potential policy responses and that there is no order of preference of instruments the Bank could use. Note, these comments also coincided with Draghi stating that he sees the risk of a recession as ‘low’. That said, overall, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that despite some of the price action alongside the press conference, they would caution against the perception that the risk of easing in September has diminished and instead conclude that they are “very confident that today’s message from the central bank is that they’ll do more”. As such, the consultancy reiterates its view that the ECB will lower rates in September and potentially lower rates by 20bps if market expectations sustain. Furthermore, Pantheon thinks that a tiered interest rate system will be implemented, as well as a QE programme, however, they suspect the size of such a plan will be modest.</p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES:</strong> ECB sources stated that they see the deposit rate cut in September as almost certain in September, that more government bond buying and a change to guidance is also likely but that policy makers still need to be convinced about the Tiering system, echoing some of Draghi’s comments earlier. The sources also state that the purchases of stocks and bank bonds are seen as a non-starter.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS:</strong> US Durable Goods Orders came in a 2%, exceeding expectations for 0.7% and above the prior, which was revised lower to -2.3%, in what was the largest gain since last summer. The rise was supported through an increase in transportation equipment, particularly in aircraft orders which saw an increase of 75%, however Wells Fargo note this is curious due to continued challenges at Boeing, saying the surge in aircraft orders is not likely to repeat itself. However, despite the rise in aircraft orders, non-defence capital goods ex aircraft still saw the strongest monthly increase in over a year, jumping from 0.5% to 1.9%.</p><p><strong>* US ADVANCED GOODS TRADE:</strong> The US Advanced Goods Trade Balance for June narrowed to a USD 74.17bln deficit, from the prior month’s deficit of USD 75.05bln; a touch worse than USD 72.5 consensus of USD 72.5bln. Pantheon notes exports fell 2.7% and imports declined by 2.2%, but due to the sheer size of imports, the overall deficit narrowed. PM highlight “the deterioration is mostly in the export numbers, which have softened broadly - this is mostly not a story about Boeing’s troubles - presumably due to a combination of slower global growth and the strong dollar.”</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>US officials said that North Korea appeared to test missiles similar to those in May, but with more enhanced capabilities, according to reports, which added that the geopolitically sensitive nation is decreasing the time it takes to prepare missiles for launch, potentially decreasing the warning time the US has to detect them. The US State Department later urged North Korea for no more provocations, reiterating the need for diplomatic engagement.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>German Foreign Ministry sources reported that Germany is ready to take part in the Strait of Hormuz security mission, which Britain had instigated, but a German Foreign Minister spokesperson later denied the claims, saying that Germany doesn’t want to be in the Strait and it is too early to discuss its involvement.</p><p><strong>* UKRAINE/RUSSIA: </strong>Ukraine detained a Russian tanker, the Nika Spirit, claiming that the ship was involved in the capture of three Ukrainian ships in Crimea in 2018, potentially putting more pressure on the already strained Ukraine-Russia relationship.</p><p><strong>* SPAIN:</strong> As expected, Spain's PSOE leader Sanchez failed to win parliamentary backing to become Prime Minister, raising the risk of a repeat election. Over the next two months, Sanchez can continue his efforts to secure a majority and go back to parliament if the king invites him to, however if he fails the king will dissolve parliament and call for a new general election which would take place in November.</p><p><strong>* CBRT REVIEW:</strong> The CBRT cut rates by 425bps, from 24% to 19.75%, a deeper cut than the consensus. A cut was always expected (the median view was -250bps); key was the magnitude of the cut, with forecasts ranging from -100bps to -800bps. the 425bps of easing slightly over-delivered, therefore. The knee-jerk reaction saw TRY pressured, however, it rebounded after the market digested the CBRT's guidance (cautious monetary policy stance). ING says the CBRT clearly feels more confident about the strength of the ongoing disinflation trend, and front-loaded the easing cycle amid an improvement in the political and geopolitical backdrop. Looking ahead the CBRT said the extent of next policy moves will be determined by the underlying inflation trend; that trend is expected to see inflation continued to decelerate through November due to base effects, before rising. This suggests the CBRT may take a pause on cuts for now. The central bank remains focused on inflation levels and stated maintaining a sustained disinflation process, is the key for lower sovereign risk, lower long term interest rates as well as a stronger economic recovery. The committee also emphasised that their stance may be revised dependent upon upcoming data, but they do forecast inflation to materialise slightly below their year-end projections. ING says that given the emphasis on the disinflation process and a cautious monetary stance, the CBRT will likely come up with measured moves in the upcoming MPCs as the real policy rate now is less divergent from that of other EM counterparts in line with the Governor’s objective of “a reasonable rate of real return”.</p><p><strong>* CBR PREVIEW:</strong> The CBR are expected to cut rates by 25bps to 7.25%, and, following the rate cut in June, completes the unwinding of two precautionary hikes implemented late 2018. Analysts suggest that a deeper rate cut is not on the agenda given elevated inflation expectations, the policy rate sitting just above neutral (estimated at between 6-7%). Looking ahead, the market is currently pricing in three rate cuts over the next nine months. Price pressures have been cooling more quickly than anticipated, but at 4.5% Y/Y remains within the CBR's 4.2% to 4.7% year-end forecasted range. However, consumer inflation expectations remain high, perhaps limiting the scope for a deeper than 25bps rate cut; with that said, corporate inflation expectations, a gauge watched by the CBR, has been softening notably. Nordea's analysts argue that there is room for further softness due to base effects from H2 2018 (when inflation was rising on RUB declines, and gasoline prices rises). It also says that current inflation could be at a level consistent with the 4% Y/Y target, signalling more disinflation ahead. RUB may only see limited moves on the back of a consensus -25bps, since policymakers have guided to such an outcome. Nordea says the RUB will be more focussed on the outcome of the FOMC's 31st July meeting; the bank thinks that any move lower in OFZ yields will require distinctly more dovish communications (perhaps: hints on a lower estimate of neutral, or the Fed fulfilling market expectations of the future cuts); \"Given that an upside in OFZ prices is currently limited, the developments in this market are now much less important for the RUB than they used to be in early 2019 when OFZ repricing was attracting foreign investors and creating additional RUB demand. Now that the change in the CBR communication is more or less priced in, the Fed’s moves are much more important for the RUB than the CBR decisions.\"</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 7+ LOWER AT 127-09:</strong> The T-Note ended the day lower, alongside EGBs, after the ECB held rates and opened the door for accommodation, but not as immediate as some had expected. Prior to the ECB, Treasuries were taking their cues from the disappointing German July IFO survey, where Business Climate, Current Conditions, and Expectations all missed expectations. The T-plex spiked higher on the initial release of the ECB statement, before reversing course as participants seemingly read the lack of details on the upcoming APP and rate tiering system as less dovish then what some had expected. The selling was exacerbated by a strong US June Durable Goods report (2% vs. exp. 0.7%) and block selling, with some analysts attributing the sell-off in stocks and rates to risk parity funds. The trend failed to stop at the 7-year auction which tailed by a chunky 1.4bps, B/C at a multi-year low of 2.27x, and dealers taking a larger share than average. At settlement spreads were little changed with yields firmer across the entire curve between 3bps-4bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.14 HIGHER AT USD 56.02/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.21 HIGHER AT USD 63.39/BBL:</strong> Crude prices ended slightly firmer on the day, but did retreat heavily from their highs in the European session, where a stronger dollar, a sell-off in equities, and a lack of upside energy catalysts saw selling into settlement. Citigroup’s analysts say that the earlier gains could be more due to participants reassessing the extent of the sell-off on Wednesday, which was attributed to concerns that Kuwait and Saudi might resume production in their neutral zone; the bank also notes that the large draw in inventories may have been overly discounted. Elsewhere, PVM notes that although newsflow was light during the earlier gains, the Brent front-month contango had reversed, providing bullish support.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.5% at 3004, NASDAQ-100 -1% at 7930, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.5% at 27144, SECTORS; </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary -0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples 0%, S&amp;P 500 Energy -1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Financials -0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology -0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Materials -0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services -0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities -0.3%.</p><p><strong>* US EARNINGS:</strong> 3M Company (MMM) shot higher, but ultimately finished in the red, after beating on top and bottom lines and guided its FY19 EPS view slightly above expectations. Dow Inc. (DOW) fell after the co. beat on the bottom line, but missed on the top and lowered its FY19 CapEx view. Facebook, Inc. (FB) moved initially higher after revenue and daily average users came in slightly higher than expectations; desks spoke optimistically of the co.’s efforts to monetise its Facebook Stories feature, however the co. finished the session in the red. The lower EPS figure reflected recent FTC legal fees. PayPal (PYPL) sunk after the co. missed on top and bottom lines and reduced revenue guidance. Tesla Inc (TSLA) sunk after the co. posted a larger than expected loss, missed on revenue expectations and cut its FY CapEx view, reigniting concerns over the firm’s future profitability prospects. Vehicle delivery guidance was maintained. Ford Motor (F) fell after the co. missed on bottom line expectations and presented poor guidance, with analysts also noting headwinds from a more competitive truck market in North America. Raytheon Co. (RTN) advanced after the co. posted a healthy beat on top and bottom lines and raised guidance across the board. Tractor Supply Co (TSCO) fell after the co posted weak guidance, despite profit and revenue for the quarter printing in line. Align Technologies (ALGN) sunk after provided poor guidance for Q3. Other notable stocks benefiting from strong earnings; Baxter International Inc. (BAX), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), International Paper (IP), Masco Corp. (MAS), TechnipFMC (FTI), Torchmark Corp. (TMK). Other notable stocks under pressure after weak earnings; AGNC Investment Corp (AGNC), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Xilinx (XLNX), Allegion (ALLE), Ameriprise Financial (AMP), Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), Invesco Ltd. (IVZ), Laboratory Corp. of America Holding (LH), LKQ Corporation (LKQ), Roper Technologies (ROP), Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL), Valero Energy (VLO), Varian Medical Systems (VAR).</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> US stocks followed their European counterparts lower after less dovish than expected ECB President Draghi disappointed investors. Airline names, including American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE), as well as Boeing (BA) were pressured after earnings releases in the sector reignited concerns over the 737 MAX grounding. The Chemours Co. (CC), Dillards Inc (DDS) and Scientific Games Corp (SGMS) all shot higher as news emerged that Greenlight capital has taken a stake in each firm. Strong earnings from Raytheon (RTN) lifted defence names including United Technologies (UTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). Borg Warner Inc (BWA), after already having sunk in the wake of weak earnings, saw further downside on reports of a SEC investigation into asbestos claims against the co. Axalta Coatings Systems (AXTA) shot higher on the news that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) and KKR (KKR) may consider bidding for the co.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> ECB day saw choppy price action for <strong>EUR</strong>; initially, the single currency fell on the release of the ECB policy meeting statement, in which substantial dovish tweaks had been made; EURUSD made YTD lows just above 1.1100. However, the move reversed as ECB President Draghi began to speak; the market seemingly spoked by indications that certain views on policy within the council are less dovish than the market had hoped and Draghi even noting that he thinks recession risk is low. However, later in the session, it was the <strong>USD</strong> that finished on the front foot; EURUSD effectively finishing the day where it started (around 1.1150). As the euro &amp; buck marched higher, safe havens <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> were the big losers, EURCHF and USDJPY moving convincingly back above 1.10 and 108.70 respectively. Thursday also saw a CBRT rate decision:<strong> TRY</strong> initially spiked higher to around 5.7700 (vs the buck) after the central bank opted to slash rates by 425bps. However, the move quickly reversed as attention turned to the central bank’s statement, which emphasised caution going forward. <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> lagged for their own reasons; dovish comments RBA Governor Lowe saw AUDUSD back below 0.6950, whilst Westpac cut back its forecast for RBNZ rates, calling for a further two cuts this year (following on from Wednesday’s more dovish forecast for the RBA). NZDUSD subsequently lost the 0.6700 handle. <strong>GBP</strong> and <strong>CAD</strong> also lagged, dollar strength doing little to help. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker as the dollar/euro advanced; <strong>ZAR</strong> was weighed by a Moody’s credit negative warning, on the back of the country’s financial assistance for state owned energy co. Eskom; USDZAR shot back above 14.00 to settle around 14.10. <strong>BRL</strong> was also weaker, but managed to stave off the 3.8000 handle.</p>",

Prior to the ECB, Treasuries were taking their cues from the disappointing German July IFO survey, where Business Climate, Current Conditions, and Expectations all missed expectations. The T-plex spiked higher on the initial release of the ECB statement, before reversing course as participants seemingly read the lack of details on the upcoming APP and rate tiering system as less dovish then what some had expected. The selling was exacerbated by a strong US June Durable Goods report (2% vs. exp. 0.7%) and block selling, with some analysts attributing the sell-off in stocks and rates to risk parity funds. The trend failed to stop at the 7-year auction which tailed by a chunky 1.4bps, B/C at a multi-year low of 2.27x, and dealers taking a larger share than average. At settlement spreads were little changed with yields firmer across the entire curve between 3bps-4bps.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>FX WRAP: </strong>ECB day saw choppy price action for<strong> EUR; </strong>initially<strong>, </strong>the single currency<strong> </strong>fell<strong> </strong>on the release of the ECB policy meeting statement, in which substantial dovish tweaks had been made; EURUSD made YTD lows just above 1.1100. However, the move reversed as ECB President Draghi began to speak; the market seemingly spoked by indications that certain views on policy within the council are less dovish than the market had hoped and Draghi even noting that he thinks recession risk is low. However,<strong> </strong>later in the session, it was the <strong>USD</strong> that finished on the front foot; EURUSD effectively finishing the day where it started (around 1.1150). As the euro &amp; buck marched higher, safe havens <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> were the big losers, EURCHF and USDJPY moving convincingly back above 1.10 and 108.70 respectively. Thursday also saw a CBRT rate decision: <strong>TRY</strong> initially spiked higher to around 5.7700 (vs the buck) after the central bank opted to slash rates by 425bps. However, the move quickly reversed as attention turned to the central bank’s statement, which emphasised caution going forward. <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> lagged for their own reasons; dovish comments RBA Governor Lowe saw AUDUSD back below 0.6950, whilst Westpac cut back its forecast for RBNZ rates, calling for a further two cuts this year (following on from Wednesday’s more dovish forecast for the RBA). NZDUSD subsequently lost the 0.6700 handle. <strong>GBP</strong> and <strong>CAD</strong> also lagged, dollar strength doing little to help. <strong>EMFX </strong>was weaker as the dollar/euro advanced; <strong>ZAR</strong> was weighed by a Moody’s credit negative warning, on the back of the country’s financial assistance for state owned energy co. Eskom; USDZAR shot back above 14.00 to settle around 14.10. <strong>BRL</strong> was also weaker, but managed to stave off the 3.8000 handle.</p>",

Citigroup’s analysts say that the earlier gains could be more due to participants reassessing the extent of the sell-off on Wednesday, which was attributed to concerns that Kuwait and Saudi might resume production in their neutral zone; the bank also notes that the large draw in inventories may have been overly discounted. Elsewhere, PVM notes that although newsflow was light during the earlier gains, the Brent front-month contango had reversed, providing bullish support.</p>",

USD 72bln is set to mature at the month-end settlement, net supply is implied ta USD 59bln. TD Securities notes that the Fed portfolio run-off has slowed to USD 15bln per month (versus USD 30bln per month previously); and with USD 21.5bln of the SOMA portfolio maturing at month-end, the Fed will add on USD 2.3bln to 2s, USD 2.3bln to 5s, and USD 1.8bn to 7s.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts are slightly positive about the auction, and say the 7-year sector trades cheap in the curve versus 5s and 10s, and thinks it trades fair in asset swap versus older 5s in terms of relative value. The bank says that the sector could see good demand, noting that the 7-year WI yield currently trades near 1.91%, higher than the June auction stop out rate. SocGen also notes that the May 7-year auction saw good demand from investment funds and foreigners.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/6c450ab5-1f25-4964-bff8-f6e8b03cc2cb.jpg&quot;}\"></figure>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: whopping CBRT rate cut, dovish ECB guidance and SA ratings alert",
        "content": "<p><strong>EUR/TRY/ZAR</strong></p><p>All very volatile, but not ending Thursday’s EU session where one might expect in the case of the Euro and Lira. Indeed, the single currency is decidedly stronger across the board in wake of ECB President Draghi’s post-meeting press conference and Q&amp;A that did not come across as dovish as the adjustments to FG inferred or were deemed to be initially. In short, no rate cut was even discussed today and for reference the market was evenly split on a 10 bp ease in contrast to the actual consensus. Moreover, the aforementioned changes to guidance were not backed unanimously, but by broad convergence after a wide-ranging discussion, the threat of a recession is still seen to be low and some GC members remain reserved about tiered deposits. Hence, even though there was enough to suggest some form or degree of stimulus is coming, and probably in September, but the ECB is not ready to go all in, yet. In response, Eur/Usd has turned 360+ degrees from almost 1.1100 to circa 1.1188 and Euro crosses have followed suit. Similarly, a knee-jerk spike in Usd/Try to around 5.7700 or higher was more than reversed to sub-5.6500 at one stage after the CBRT slashed 425 bp from Turkey’s benchmark policy rate, but signalled caution going forward and a weaker inflation outlook compared to its April forecast with CPI now seen a tad below target by year end. However, the Rand was unable to recover from a Moody’s credit negative warning for SA on the back of the latest financial assistance for Eskom as the ratings agency highlighted the additional strain this would place on the Government’s finances. Indeed, Usd/Zar rebounded from just under 13.8600 to a peak of 14.0800 or so with accelerated gains once the psychological 14.0000 level was crossed.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is broadly firmer beyond the somewhat unexpected and perhaps perverse Euro and Lira developments noted above, with Eur/Usd keeping the <strong>DXY</strong> depressed given its greater index weighting within 97.915-490 confines and back below key Fib resistance. Nevertheless, the Franc, Kiwi, Yen and Aussie have all weakened vs the Greenback to approx 0.9900, 0.6675, 108.50 and 0.6950 respectively, with Eur/Chf also firmly off recent lows and over 1.1050 to the relief of the SNB no doubt. Conversely, dovish RBNZ and RBA vibes continue to weigh on Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd, while Usd/Jpy breached a key chart level and broke away from more heavy option expiry interest around 108.00 alongside rebounding US Treasury yields ahead of the BoJ and Fed next week. In contrast, the Pound and Loonie managed to buck the overall trend as Cable stuck close to 1.2500 and Usd/Cad held between 1.3150-15.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns were both undermined by the firm Euro bounce and a general downturn in risk sentiment, with Eur/Nok currently nearer the top of a 9.6875-5960 band despite firm oil prices and Eur/Sek hovering closer to 10.5550 highs than 10.4890 lows, but also disappointing Norwegian and Swedish releases (such as jobs data and sentiment surveys).</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>As forecast by consensus, policymakers opted to stand pat on rates and thus refrained from lowering the deposit rate, despite market pricing leaning towards such a move ahead of the meeting (53% chance of a cut, pre-announcement). However, the Bank paved the way for an eventual rate cut by tweaking its forward guidance on rates to include an “or lower” option and as such, markets now price in a 93% chance of a 10bps rate cut at the September meeting. Other dovish elements to the policy statement included the Governing Council tasking the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, the design of a tiered rate system, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases. This sentiment was also reinforced by the statement highlighting the need for “a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time”. During the press conference, Draghi’s assessment of the Eurozone economy showed that softening growth dynamics and muted inflationary pressures are hampering the region, and thus risks surrounding the Euro Area’s outlook remain classified as “titled to the downside”. The ECB President also went on to suggest that a rebound in the second half of the year looks “less likely” with the outlook looking “worse and worse”. However, markets proceeded to reverse course from their initial dovish take from the 1245BST announcement as Draghi rebuffed questions regarding the unanimity of today’s policy adjustments. Instead, Draghi suggested there was a broad discussion with \"broad convergence\" to the decision whilst noting that some board members had reservations about a two-tiered rate system. Furthermore, it was revealed that no discussion took place this week on an imminent rate cut or the size of such a prospective move. Overall, it appears that the potential policy 'bazooka' that some in the market had been looking for might not necessarily be on its way, with the ECB President keen to stress the optionality in potential policy responses and that there is no order of preference of instruments the Bank could use. Note, these comments also coincided with Draghi stating that he sees the risk of a recession as ‘low’. That said, overall, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that despite some of the price action alongside the press conference, they would caution against the perception that the risk of easing in September has diminished and instead conclude that they are “very confident that today’s message from the central bank is that they’ll do more”. As such, the consultancy reiterates its view that the ECB will lower rates in September and potentially lower rates by 20bps if market expectations sustain. Furthermore, Pantheon thinks that a tiered interest rate system will be implemented, as well as a QE programme, however, they suspect the size of such a plan will be modest.</p>",

Elsewhere, the <strong>KOSPI (-0.4%)</strong> underperformed after North Korea conducted a short-range missile launch and with earnings also heavily in focus, while <strong>Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%)</strong> were choppy as another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC was counterbalanced by trade optimism after suggestions that next week's US-China trade meeting is to be held in Shanghai to allow the possibility of President Xi joining in and that the meeting will be followed up by talks in Washington. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat as they mirrored the rangebound trade in T-notes and with demand also dampened by the indecisive gains in the region, although prices later found mild support after the 2yr auction which attracted a higher b/c and narrower tail in price.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities are directionless with large-cap earnings dictating the state of play of thus far.</strong> AEX (-0.1%) lags its peers, pressured by Unilever (-0.8%) post-earnings. Meanwhile, France’s CAC 40 (+0.5%) is benefitting from its largest weighted stock LVMH (+1.5%) which rose after the Co. posted a 20% Y/Y LFL sales increase in leather goods and fashions. Sectors are mixed with outperformance in Pharma names as heavyweight Roche (+1.3%) raised its 2019 revenue growth outlook. On the flip side, energy names lag on the back of the decline in oil prices yesterday. Individual movers include UK-listed Cobham (+34.7%) was bolstered to the top of the Stoxx 600 as the Co. is expected to be acquired for GBP 4.0bln including debt. Other interesting movers on the back of earnings, with Nokia (+6.3%), AstraZeneca (+5.6%), Kion (+4.6%) all at the top of the pan-European index. On the downside, JC Decaux (-5.2%) slid on the back of disappointing numbers whilst SMI-listed Clariant (-9.9%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. suspended talks with Sabic over the proposed JV. Over in the States, Facebook (+1.2% pre-market) reported last night with miss on top line and a beat on bottom line. The Co. also noted that EPS would have been higher excluding the FTC legal fees of USD 5bln over privacy violations. Meanwhile, Tesla (-10.8% pre-market) missed on top and bottom line. Looking ahead, around 10% of the S&amp;P 500 is reporting today, whilst DJIA component 3M is also on the docket, with a 4.5% weighting in the index.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>EUR/TRY - Not the biggest currency movers, but both certainly prone to big reactions and price action depending on Central Bank policy decisions as the ECB and CBRT both deliver verdicts today. Market pricing for the former is extremely tight between no change and -10 bp, even though the ‘consensus’ leans towards a tweak in guidance for easing in September rather than any adjustments this time, with the probability roughly 50-50. However, the latter is unanimously expected to lower its benchmark and the uncertainty rests on how much given a gaping range of forecasts, from -100 bp to -500 bp, while some observers also suggest that a loud -800 bp call exists. In the run up, the single currency and Turkish Lira are on the defensive, with Eur/Usd teetering above ytd lows in a 1.1145-23 range and capped by yet another bleak German survey in the form of Ifo that missed consensus across the board and compounded by a gloomy statement from the institute noting the spread of recession through all key industrial sectors. Meanwhile, Usd/Try is pivoting 5.7100 and also acknowledging a deterioration in manufacturing sentiment and a decline in cap u.</p><p>NZD/AUD - Dovish rate vibes are undermining the Kiwi and Aussie as well, with Westpac recalibrating its RBNZ outlook to match the RBA by pencilling in 2 more 25 bp eases from 1 previously. Nzd/Usd has retreated from 0.6700+ in response, but the Aud/Nzd cross remains anchored near 1.0400 as Aud/Usd slips a bit further from 0.7000 to 0.6965 in wake of comments from RBA Governor Lowe indicating further OCR reductions if demand disappoints and acknowledging that inflation will take time to hit target.</p><p>JPY/CAD/GBP/CHF - All narrowly mixed vs a solid Greenback, as the DXY continues to test a key Fib retracement level at 97.776 within a tight 97.778-679 band, with the Yen still stuck around 108.00 and embroiled in decent option expiries (1.7bn from 107.75 to 107.80 and 1.5 bn between 107.90-108.00) vs technical resistance at 108.31 (also a Fib). Meanwhile, the Loonie hugs 1.3128-44 ahead of Canadian wage data, Cable retains a recovery tone within 1.2450-1.2500 and the Franc remains underpinned around 0.9850 vs the Buck and over 1.1000 against the Euro, expecting the SNB to match or counteract any ECB moves.</p><p>ZAR - The Rand is underperforming after a stark warning from Moody’s that the latest state aid for Eskom will put further strain on the Government’s finances and threaten SA’s rating, with Usd/Zar nudging the top of 13.9750-8600 range.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Barring another buying spree or bullish catalyst, <strong>Bunds</strong> may well have marked out a top following the Ifo-induced spike to 174.66, while <strong>Gilts</strong> could not quite reach their 132.45 contract peak in advance of CBI trades that are seen improving appreciably, albeit remain negative in headline terms. However, the ECB is the main focus and bound to provide the next major impulse based on hyped market expectations, with disappointment or surprise in the offing via the policy call and/or President Draghi’s penultimate post-meeting press conference. However, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> remain firm and the curve flatter awaiting key data and the last auction, with 7 year supply normally well sponsored by indirects, but 2s and 5s not taken down that comfortably ahead of the July FOMC, while month end extensions are not that lengthy either.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are marginally firmer, albeit it seems to be more of a consolidation from yesterday’s DoE-induced decline and on the news that Kuwait and Saudi officials discussed resuming production from the neutral zone which had previously provided around 500k bpd of supply. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> currently reside around the 56.00/bbl and 63.50/bbl levels with the former eyeing its 50 DMA at 56.87/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.11/bbl (with the psychological 57/bbl level in-between). News flow for the complex has been light thus far with traders eyeing the ECB’s latest monetary policy decision (full preview available in the Research Suite) for the next possible catalyst. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices are relatively steady above the 1400/oz mark with Central Bank decisions very much in focus. Elsewhere <strong>copper</strong> is little changed amid the cautious/tentative risk tone whilst Shanghai <strong>lead</strong> climbed over 1% overnight amid revived supply concerns due to maintenance activity in China.</p>",

Meanwhile, France’s CAC 40 (+0.5%) is benefitting from its largest weighted stock LVMH (+1.5%) which rose after the Co. posted a 20% Y/Y LFL sales increase in leather goods and fashions. Sectors are mixed with outperformance in Pharma names as heavyweight Roche (+1.3%) raised its 2019 revenue growth outlook. On the flip side, energy names lag on the back of the decline in oil prices yesterday. Individual movers include UK-listed Cobham (+34.7%) was bolstered to the top of the Stoxx 600 as the Co. is expected to be acquired for GBP 4.0bln including debt. Other interesting movers on the back of earnings, with Nokia (+6.3%), AstraZeneca (+5.6%), Kion (+4.6%) all at the top of the pan-European index. On the downside, JC Decaux (-5.2%) slid on the back of disappointing numbers whilst SMI-listed Clariant (-9.9%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. suspended talks with Sabic over the proposed JV. Over in the States, Facebook (+1.2% pre-market) reported last night with miss on top line and a beat on bottom line. The Co. also noted that EPS would have been higher excluding the FTC legal fees of USD 5bln over privacy violations. Meanwhile, Tesla (-10.8% pre-market) missed on top and bottom line. Looking ahead, around 10% of the S&amp;P 500 is reporting today, whilst DJIA component 3M is also on the docket, with a 4.5% weighting in the index.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>EUR/TRY - Not the biggest currency movers, but both certainly prone to big reactions and price action depending on Central Bank policy decisions as the ECB and CBRT both deliver verdicts today. Market pricing for the former is extremely tight between no change and -10 bp, even though the ‘consensus’ leans towards a tweak in guidance for easing in September rather than any adjustments this time, with the probability roughly 50-50. However, the latter is unanimously expected to lower its benchmark and the uncertainty rests on how much given a gaping range of forecasts, from -100 bp to -500 bp, while some observers also suggest that a loud -800 bp call exists. In the run up, the single currency and Turkish Lira are on the defensive, with Eur/Usd teetering above ytd lows in a 1.1145-23 range and capped by yet another bleak German survey in the form of Ifo that missed consensus across the board and compounded by a gloomy statement from the institute noting the spread of recession through all key industrial sectors. Meanwhile, Usd/Try is pivoting 5.7100 and also acknowledging a deterioration in manufacturing sentiment and a decline in cap u.</p><p>NZD/AUD - Dovish rate vibes are undermining the Kiwi and Aussie as well, with Westpac recalibrating its RBNZ outlook to match the RBA by pencilling in 2 more 25 bp eases from 1 previously. Nzd/Usd has retreated from 0.6700+ in response, but the Aud/Nzd cross remains anchored near 1.0400 as Aud/Usd slips a bit further from 0.7000 to 0.6965 in wake of comments from RBA Governor Lowe indicating further OCR reductions if demand disappoints and acknowledging that inflation will take time to hit target.</p><p>JPY/CAD/GBP/CHF - All narrowly mixed vs a solid Greenback, as the DXY continues to test a key Fib retracement level at 97.776 within a tight 97.778-679 band, with the Yen still stuck around 108.00 and embroiled in decent option expiries (1.7bn from 107.75 to 107.80 and 1.5 bn between 107.90-108.00) vs technical resistance at 108.31 (also a Fib).

Meanwhile, France’s CAC 40 (+0.5%) is benefitting from its largest weighted stock LVMH (+1.5%) which rose after the Co. posted a 20% Y/Y LFL sales increase in leather goods and fashions. Sectors are mixed with outperformance in Pharma names as heavyweight Roche (+1.3%) raised its 2019 revenue growth outlook. On the flip side, energy names lag on the back of the decline in oil prices yesterday. Individual movers include UK-listed Cobham (+34.7%) was bolstered to the top of the Stoxx 600 as the Co. is expected to be acquired for GBP 4.0bln including debt. Other interesting movers on the back of earnings, with Nokia (+6.3%), AstraZeneca (+5.6%), Kion (+4.6%) all at the top of the pan-European index. On the downside, JC Decaux (-5.2%) slid on the back of disappointing numbers whilst SMI-listed Clariant (-9.9%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. suspended talks with Sabic over the proposed JV. Over in the States, Facebook (+1.2% pre-market) reported last night with miss on top line and a beat on bottom line. The Co. also noted that EPS would have been higher excluding the FTC legal fees of USD 5bln over privacy violations. Meanwhile, Tesla (-10.8% pre-market) missed on top and bottom line. Looking ahead, around 10% of the S&amp;P 500 is reporting today, whilst DJIA component 3M is also on the docket, with a 4.5% weighting in the index.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>EUR/TRY - Not the biggest currency movers, but both certainly prone to big reactions and price action depending on Central Bank policy decisions as the ECB and CBRT both deliver verdicts today. Market pricing for the former is extremely tight between no change and -10 bp, even though the ‘consensus’ leans towards a tweak in guidance for easing in September rather than any adjustments this time, with the probability roughly 50-50. However, the latter is unanimously expected to lower its benchmark and the uncertainty rests on how much given a gaping range of forecasts, from -100 bp to -500 bp, while some observers also suggest that a loud -800 bp call exists. In the run up, the single currency and Turkish Lira are on the defensive, with Eur/Usd teetering above ytd lows in a 1.1145-23 range and capped by yet another bleak German survey in the form of Ifo that missed consensus across the board and compounded by a gloomy statement from the institute noting the spread of recession through all key industrial sectors. Meanwhile, Usd/Try is pivoting 5.7100 and also acknowledging a deterioration in manufacturing sentiment and a decline in cap u.</p><p>NZD/AUD - Dovish rate vibes are undermining the Kiwi and Aussie as well, with Westpac recalibrating its RBNZ outlook to match the RBA by pencilling in 2 more 25 bp eases from 1 previously. Nzd/Usd has retreated from 0.6700+ in response, but the Aud/Nzd cross remains anchored near 1.0400 as Aud/Usd slips a bit further from 0.7000 to 0.6965 in wake of comments from RBA Governor Lowe indicating further OCR reductions if demand disappoints and acknowledging that inflation will take time to hit target.</p><p>JPY/CAD/GBP/CHF - All narrowly mixed vs a solid Greenback, as the DXY continues to test a key Fib retracement level at 97.776 within a tight 97.778-679 band, with the Yen still stuck around 108.00 and embroiled in decent option expiries (1.7bn from 107.75 to 107.80 and 1.5 bn between 107.90-108.00) vs technical resistance at 108.31 (also a Fib). Meanwhile, the Loonie hugs 1.3128-44 ahead of Canadian wage data, Cable retains a recovery tone within 1.2450-1.2500 and the Franc remains underpinned around 0.9850 vs the Buck and over 1.1000 against the Euro, expecting the SNB to match or counteract any ECB moves.</p><p>ZAR - The Rand is underperforming after a stark warning from Moody’s that the latest state aid for Eskom will put further strain on the Government’s finances and threaten SA’s rating, with Usd/Zar nudging the top of 13.9750-8600 range.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Barring another buying spree or bullish catalyst, <strong>Bunds</strong> may well have marked out a top following the Ifo-induced spike to 174.66, while <strong>Gilts</strong> could not quite reach their 132.45 contract peak in advance of CBI trades that are seen improving appreciably, albeit remain negative in headline terms.

Nothing UK-specific stands out behind the latest upturn in debt, but US Treasuries are also climbing and the 10 year note future has edged above a technical level that has been holding circa 127.20+, with the equivalent yield edging closer to 2% again. Dovish global Central Bank momentum remains supportive alongside an element of safe-haven demand due to several geopolitical and diplomatic threats, as markets brace for rate cuts or at least firm guidance that further stimulus is coming. Back to Liffe, the Short Sterling strip is flat 1 tick above par and has been 1.5 ticks firmer ahead of CBI distributive trades that will be overshadowed by the ECB.</p>",

As such, the greenback’s major counterparts also lacked impetus with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> subdued ahead of today’s ECB policy meeting and following recent weak Eurozone PMI figures, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated after the prior day’s outperformance was stalled by resistance at the 1.2500 handle. The hesitant risk tone kept <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> little changed near a cluster of option expiries around 108.00 and contained antipodeans near this week’s lows, and although <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly reclaimed the 0.6700 handle, the upside was limited by a lack of fresh catalysts as well as further rate cut expectations with Westpac now forecasting the RBNZ to lower the OCR in August and November vs. Prev. view for a cut in just August. Meanwhile, <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was slightly pressured by comments from Governor Lowe who suggested a readiness to ease further if required and that it reasonable to expect rates to remain low for an extended period.</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe said prepared for further policy easing if demand disappoints and that it is reasonable to expect an extended period of low interest rates. Lowe added that evidence does not support an adjustment to 2%-3% inflation target and that it is certainly possible for demand to be firm enough to lift inflation in a reasonable timeframe but added that it will be sometime before inflation comfortably returns to target range.

German Manufacturing PMI came in below expectations at 43.1, the lowest since July 2012, which helped set record lows in German yields, and naturally lower yields in Treasuries. The trend continued heading into the US equity open and was supported more by the US Manufacturing PMI print of 50, the lowest since September 2009. However, resistance emerged going into the 5-year auction, which tailed by 1bps and B/C ratio of 2.26x (six-auction average of 2.39x), indirects took the lowest share since December 2015 and dealers took their largest share since December 2018.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were higher but with gains capped by weakness in mining related sectors and with Tokyo trade also contained by an uneventful currency after source reports suggested a lack of consensus within the BoJ regarding additional easing measures at next week’s meeting. Elsewhere, the KOSPI (-0.5%) underperformed after North Korea conducted a short-range missile launch and with earnings also heavily in focus, while Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) were choppy as another substantial liquidity drain by the PBoC was counterbalanced by trade optimism after suggestions that next week's US-China trade meeting is to be held in Shanghai to allow the possibility of President Xi joining in and that the meeting will be followed up by talks in Washington. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat as they mirrored the rangebound trade in T-notes and with demand also dampened by the indecisive gains in the region, although prices later found mild support after the 2yr auction which attracted a higher b/c and narrower tail in price.</p>",
