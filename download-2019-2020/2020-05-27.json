Equity futures managed to return close to their pre-market highs (we printed another post Q1 crash high for ES today prior to the cash open). Treasury yields are lower across the curve with a flattening bias. The USD has meandered around unchanged, which has given a mixed feel in FX. Oil is lower amid reports of profit-taking. The risk bid proved resilient, and stocks soon were back in the black. In terms of the composition, it was a case of the ‘normalisation trade’ (names which benefit from lockdown were sold, and names which suffered were bought), which resulted in growth and momentum baskets underperforming, while value and small cap baskets saw a decent session again. In Europe, the mood was constructive as the EU Commission announced details of its long-awaited virus response, but the initial feeling is that there is still a high hurdle getting it passed all 27 member states that must approve it unanimously. There was little added to the narrative in Fedspeak today. The Nasdaq 100 underperformed on news that NTES and JD were to have Hong Kong listings considered on Thursday (both have a combined weighting around 0.8% in the index), in addition to the bias towards cyclicals/value. Later, Secretary of State Pompeo said the US was considering suspending HK’s special status, which could result in the island being placed under the same tariff arrangement as China; stocks saw downside, although the ES once again recovered back to its key 200dma, located around the psychological 3,000 handle. SPX +1.5% at 3036, NDX +0.5% at 9442, DJIA +2.2% at 25,548.</p><p>Treasuries pared some of Tuesday’s weakness as risk appetite came under pressure from amplified China/Hong Kong tensions, although supply likely provided some resistance. Overnight the TPLEX had been choppy, although as equities moved to the downside, the curve bull flattened and held onto its bid despite equities reversing their weakness into the afternoon. However, in the context of Tuesday’s chunky bear-steepening, perhaps participants were cautious to let rates back up any further, particularly with growing Fed talk of YCC. Meanwhile, supply continued on Wednesday as the Treasury sold its new 5-year Notes at the upsized USD 45bln amount, which did not go so smoothly, tailing the 0.321% WI by 1.2bps, while the 2.28x cover ratio was less than both the average and the prior, while dealers took a larger share than average versus the previous. Note, that due to the roll period, the September (Q) T-Note contract now has the largest open interest. T-note (M0) futures settled 5 ticks higher at 138-27.</p>",

It is worth noting a report in the Global Times earlier, which suggested that China could go nuclear and dump US assets like dollar-holdings if the US carried out its ‘threats’; there was also a piece which suggested China would impose coal import restrictions, starting with Australia, which hit the AUD.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>Following source reports yesterday suggesting China sanctions over Hong Kong, US President Trump noted the US is doing something about it but did not provide details, adding we will hear about US actions on China by the end of the week. US Commerce Secretary Ross also stated that the situation with China is very complex and there is a whole menu of options for the US on China. The response from China’s Foreign Ministry stated that HK legislation is entirely an internal affair for China and it will take all necessary countermeasures against foreign interference. The China Global Times also added that China has sufficient tools to exert financial pain on the US such as including the dumping of its massive holdings of US dollar denominated assets if the US carries out its threats against Chinese companies. While separate reports suggested NetEase (NTES) and JD.Com (JD) are preparing for a HK listing as pressure rises form the US to disclose financial information or to delist from the US exchanges.</p><p><strong>HONG KONG: </strong>US Secretary of State Pompeo announced he has certified to congress that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under US laws in the same manner as US laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997. Certifying HK is no longer autonomous from China. Pompeo noted it is clear China is modelling Hong Kong after itself and that no reasonable person can assert today that HK maintains a High Degree of autonomy from China given the facts on the ground. After the announcement, source reports suggested the Trump administration is mulling suspending Hong Kong’s preferential US tariff rate for exports to the US in response to China’s planned security law, which could see Hong Kong face the same tariffs from the US as mainland China. Secretary of State Pompeo seemed to suggest China are going against the \"one country, two system policy\" which the US have been heavily opposed against before; sources suggested sanctions would take place on China officials and firms. This could question the \"special status\" of Hong Kong, which currently sees the US treat Hong Kong differently from mainland China on trade, commerce and more.&nbsp; The removal of the special status would be a blow to China.

Following the announcement EU Council President Michel stated the recovery fund will be on the agenda of the June 19th regular council, and an agreement should be attained prior to the Summer break. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Merkel noted she does not expect an agreement on the EU plan at the next summit. While Austria, one of the “Frugal Four” noted the proposal is a starting point for negotiations”, adding the grant/loan ratio needs to be negotiated. While Sweden’s PM, another “Frugal Four” member, stated the EU recovery fund should be loans and not grants. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/snap-analysis-european-commission-attempts-a-compromise-refile-27-05-2020\">Click here for full analysis.</a></p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED SPEAK: </strong>NY Fed President Williams (voter, neutral) said YCC is potentially a tool that could compliment forward guidance (echoing Clarida last week). Williams also noted that the Fed was in the early stages of forming its SEPs for the June meeting. He reiterated that he expects rates to remain low for quite some time, and expects inflation to be low over the next year or so. The NY Fed President also said that he is not seeing any signs of a shortage of demand for USTs (coming as the Desk continues to taper its purchases each week). Elsewhere, Fed's Bullard (dove, non-voter) said he doubts that YCC would have much impact at this moment with long-term interest rates this low. Bullard also said he favours forward guidance based on the state of the economy, rather than on the calendar – note that former Fed Chair Yellen ran a similar style of outcome-based policy during her tenor. Bullard also said that he does not think this is the time to think about balance sheet reductions and would not be entertaining rate rises until the medium-term.</p><p><strong>FED BEIGE BOOK: </strong>Economic activity declined in all Districts – falling sharply in most – reflecting disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/fed-s-beige-book-economic-activity-declined-in-all-districts-falling-sharply-in-most-reflecting-disruptions-associated-with-the-covid-19-pandemic-27-05-2020\">Click here for full release</a>.</p><p><strong>ECB: </strong>ECB President Lagarde noted that the ECB’s scenario of mild growth has already become outdated noting growth is likely to be in the range of the medium and severe scenarios. The ECB's scenario analysis suggested real GDP was set to fall in 2020 by around 5%, 8%, and 12% under the mild, medium and severe scenarios, respectively, a view later backed by de Guindos. Elsewhere, ECB’s Schnabel is confident the ECB can avoid a situation with the GCC regarding the Bundesbank not participating in PSPP and does not think it will come to the Bundesbank being ordered to stop buying bonds. When asked about the need for a Eurobond, she stated the fundamental problem is that if liability is transferred to the European level, then the decision making also needs to happen at the European level. She noted Debt Mutualisation is one option, but it is not the only one that could also help loosen the bank-sovereign nexus, adding a safe European asset would make a lot of things easier.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 5 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-27.</strong></p><p>Treasuries pared some of Tuesday’s weakness as risk appetite came under pressure from amplified China/Hong Kong tensions, although supply likely provided some resistance. Overnight the TPLEX had been choppy, although as equities moved to the downside, the curve bull flattened and held onto its bid despite equities reversing their weakness into the afternoon. However, in the context of Tuesday’s chunky bear-steepening, perhaps participants were cautious to let rates back up any further, particularly with growing Fed talk of YCC. Meanwhile, supply continued on Wednesday as the Treasury sold its new 5-year Notes at the upsized USD 45bln amount, which did not go so smoothly, tailing the 0.321% WI by 1.2bps, while the 2.28x cover ratio was less than both the average and the prior, while dealers took a larger share than average versus the previous. Note, that due to the roll period, the September (Q) T-Note contract now has the largest open interest.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY:</strong> US will sell a new 5-year (USD 45bln, Wednesday) and a new 7-year (USD 38bln, Thursday) this week, for a total of USD 127bln; analysts note that 101bln of cash flows fall due this week, (around USD 92bln redemptions, and around 9bln in coupons), implying net supply of USD 26bln. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-new-2-year-usd-44bln-tue-new-5-year-usd-45bln-wed-and-a-new-7-year-usd-38bln-thu-this-week-25-05-2020\">See auction previews here.</a></p><ul><li><strong>7-YEAR RECENT HISTORY:</strong></li><li>High-yield: (prev. 0.525%, six-auction average 1.263%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.1bps, six-auction avg. -0.3bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.56x, six-auction avg. 2.52x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 21.3%, six-auction avg. 22.7%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 12.3%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.1%)</li></ul><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 1.54 LOWER AT USD 32.81; BRENT (Q0) SETTLED USD 1.29 LOWER AT USD 35.45</strong></p><p>Energy futures traded in the red on Wednesday as recent bullish sentiment pared amid Hong Kong woes and less supportive OPEC+ comments. The losses were most acute heading into the US session. The combination of Chinese companies taking steps to move away from US exchanges and reports that China was to implement import bans on coal, saw risk assets come under pressure – energy was no outlier. However, front-month energy futures did come off its lows – for WTI at 32.18 and Brent at 34.26 – alongside other risk assets later into the afternoon. On the supply front, IEA said that the COVID-19 crisis is causing the biggest decline in global energy investment in history, saying that global investment in energy is to drop 20%, or by USD 400bln, this year vs its previous forecast of 2% growth. Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO said he expects oil demand to be -10% this year, and natgas -5%. Meanwhile, the Kremlin noted that Russian President Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince spoke on the phone and agreed on further coordination on oil output cuts – this followed earlier reports that Russia prefers to stick to with the existing cuts rather than deepen cuts beyond June. Looking ahead, the weekly US energy inventories are to be released tomorrow, with the private data later this evening, due to the market holiday on Monday causing a one-day postponement of the releases; current expectations (bbls): crude -1.9mln, distillate +1.8mln, gasoline +0.1mln.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.5% at 3036, NDX +0.5% at 9442, DJIA +2.2% at 25,548</li><li><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Financials +4.3%, Industrials +3.3%, Real Estate +2.1%, Communications +2.1%, Staples +1.6%, Discretionary +1.3%, Energy +1.2%, Utilities +1.1%, Health Care +1.1%, Materials +1%, Technology +0.5%.</li><li><strong>EUROPE CLOSES:</strong> EURO STOXX 50 +1.67% at 3049, FTSE 100 +1.29% at 6146, DAX +1.28% at 11652, CAC 40 +1.79% at 4689, IBEX 35 +2.33% at 7167, FTSE MIB +0.20% at 17896, SMI -1.21% at 9712.</li></ul><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Social Media names (FB, TWTR) are facing scrutiny from US President Trump, who tweeted “we will strongly regulate, or close them down” before they “totally silence conservatives voices”. Tesla (TSLA) cut the prices of its entire vehicle line between USD 2000-5000. Boeing (BA) is to announce 2500 voluntary layoffs, later announced it will conduct 6,770 involuntary layoffs after the voluntary programme. Boeing (BA) also announced it is to move forward with plans to restart its 737 MAX production at its Renton, Washington facility, and that some customers are reporting reservations are outpacing cancellations on its flights for the first time since the pandemic. Disney (DIS) reopening proposal was accepted and it will open its Magic and Animal Kingdom from July 11th, and it’s Hollywood Studios and Epcot from July 15th. Alphabet (GOOG) is being looked into by India’s anti-trust body after allegations that it is abusing its market position to unfairly promote mobile payment applications in India. Amazon (AMZN) is to acquire a self-driving car technology company Zoox for less than its USD 2.3bln valuation. General Electric (GE) is to sell its lightbulb business for USD 250mln. Dominos (DPZ) and Papa John’s (PZZA) provided positive updates with decent SSS. Cruise lines (CCL, NCLH, RCL) are continuing their rally from yesterday, while Moderna (MRNA) continues to sell. AT&amp;T (T) is to launch its HBO Max streaming service today. MGM (MGM) and Wynn (WYNN) are set to re-open its Las Vegas casino’s on June 4th. Bank of America (BAC) CEO noted its investment banking revenue is +10% Y/Y so far this quarter. Micron (MU) issued Q3 guidance above analyst expectations.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Ralph Lauren (RL) reported a larger loss per share than expected, although revenue beat. It also suspended all of its current guidance due to uncertainty. Total SSS beat estimates (-17%, exp. 19.3%). RL announced it has reopened roughly two-thirds of its European stores and nearly half of its North American stores through the last half of May. KeySight (KEYS) reported an EPS and revenue miss, notes Q3 to be in line or a bit better than Q2.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The greenback was flat/slightly higher today amid a choppy risk environment, although US/China/HK woes leave a cautious backdrop, especially now given the US no longer considers Hong Kong autonomous from China, which may see HK fall under the same tariff’s regime as China. Overnight the greenback printed lows sub 99 but the concerning risk backdrop saw the buck rise gradually throughout the session.</p><p><strong>CNH: </strong>The Yuan continues to weaken amid the souring relationship between US and China. USDCNH matched its all-time high again today at 7.1963. HSBC highlights the divergence between AUD and CNH and is doubtful this will continue as they tend to trend in the same direction.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency also saw a choppy day after the EU came to a compromised agreement on the recovery fund where EUR 500bln will be funded through grants and EUR 250bln will be funded through loans. Overall, the package is greater than the Franco-German proposal of EUR 500bln in grants, but it does include the loans to satisfy the requirements of the “Frugal Four”. Note, the package is yet to be signed and requires support from all 27 member states. The news saw EURUSD break through 1.10 to the upside but as the dollar rose the key figure gave way once again.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, CAD, GBP):</strong> Risk sensitive FX were weaker on the session amid the concerning overhang of risk between US and China relations while AUD was particularly hit due to reports suggesting potential Chinese coal restrictions. CAD however, was flat against the buck.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The cyclical underperformer amid reports China is expected to impose coal import restrictions by tightening rules and starting with Australian shipments. ING highlights that if such a speculation were to materialise, the fall for the currency may be quite significant and the desk points out how coal is Australia's second largest export, and China is the second largest buyer. The desk suggests this could end up targeting other key Australian exports such as Iron ore, or even LNG, which would likely to have a greater impact; “A fully-fledged Australia-China trade war (which includes duties/bans on coal and iron ore) can, in our view, send AUD/USD back to the 0.60 area.”</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling also weighed on after further Brexit worries, with the latest from UK Brexit Negotiator Frost stating we do not yet have a date for the high level review of the negotiations, adding the mandate in key areas is not likely to reach an agreement and the EU needs to evolve its position. Later, French Foreign Minister added to the pessimism, noting Brexit talks are going badly and that deep differences remain.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie was flat against the dollar while cyclical counterparts took a hit. Despite the relative outperformance, crude oil was heavily down on the day but that failed to hold too have much impact on the CAD. Meanwhile the extradition of the Huawei CFO is looming, with the ruling finding the CFO lose double criminality aspect of the extradition case and the Canadian judge is considering whether to proceed with extradition.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen gave up some gains despite mounting pressures from the US and China, which MUFG says is “yet to derail the ongoing improvement in risk sentiment on a more sustained basis”. Meanwhile in Japan, PM Abe lifted the state of emergency recently and is aiming to completely reopen from August.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was generally softer against the dollar amid a mixed risk appetite due to global relations (China/US) while economic reopening hopes battled against the souring relations. The BRL however was much firmer today continuing from prior day gains, MXN was weaker today, but both the BRL and MXN are performing well on the week after several weeks of weakness. Meanwhile, the Banxico QIR expects to see growth -4.6% in 2020, but +4.1% in 2021, it noted the balance of inflation risks is still uncertain, but it has raised its Q4 inflation view to 3.5 from 3.2% and its core inflation view to 3.8% from 3.0%.</p>",

Overnight the TPLEX had been choppy, although as equities moved to the downside, the curve bull flattened and held onto its bid despite equities reversing their weakness into the afternoon. However, in the context of Tuesday’s chunky bear-steepening, perhaps participants were cautious to let rates back up any further, particularly with growing Fed talk of YCC. Meanwhile, supply continued on Wednesday as the Treasury sold its new 5-year Notes at the upsized USD 45bln amount, which did not go so smoothly, tailing the 0.321% WI by 1.2bps, while the 2.28x cover ratio was less than both the average and the prior, while dealers took a larger share than average versus the previous.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD: </strong>The greenback was flat/slightly higher today amid a choppy risk environment, although US/China/HK woes leave a cautious backdrop, especially now given the US no longer considers Hong Kong autonomous from China, which may see HK fall under the same tariffs regime as China. Overnight the greenback printed lows sub 99 but the concerning risk backdrop saw the buck rise gradually throughout the session.</p><p><strong>CNH:</strong> The Yuan continues to weaken amid the souring relationship between US and China. USDCNH matched its all-time high again today at 7.1963. HSBC highlights the divergence between AUD and CNH and is doubtful this will continue as they tend to trend in the same direction.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The single currency also saw a choppy day after the EU came to a compromised agreement on the recovery fund where EUR 500bln will be funded through grants and EUR 250bln will be funded through loans. Overall, the package is greater than the Franco-German proposal of EUR 500bln in grants, but it does include the loans to satisfy the requirements of the “Frugal Four”. Note, the package is yet to be signed and requires support from all 27 member states. The news saw EURUSD break through 1.10 to the upside but as the dollar rose the key figure gave way once again.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, CAD, GBP)</strong>: Risk sensitive FX were weaker on the session amid the concerning overhang of risk between US and China relations while AUD was particularly hit due to reports suggesting potential Chinese coal restrictions. CAD however, was flat against the buck.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The cyclical underperformer amid reports China is expected to impose coal import restrictions by tightening rules and starting with Australian shipments. ING highlights that if such a speculation were to materialise, the fall for the currency may be quite significant and the desk points out how coal is Australia's second largest export, and China is the second largest buyer. The desk suggests this could end up targeting other key Australian exports such as Iron ore, or even LNG, which would likely to have a greater impact; “A fully-fledged Australia-China trade war (which includes duties/bans on coal and iron ore) can, in our view, send AUD/USD back to the 0.60 area.”</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling also weighed on after further Brexit worries, with the latest from UK Brexit Negotiator Frost stating we do not yet have a date for the high level review of the negotiations, adding the mandate in key areas is not likely to reach an agreement and the EU needs to evolve its position. Later, French Foreign Minister added to the pessimism, noting Brexit talks are going badly and that deep differences remain.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie was flat against the dollar while cyclical counterparts took a hit. Despite the relative outperformance, crude oil was heavily down on the day but that failed to hold too have much impact on the CAD. Meanwhile the extradition of the Huawei CFO is looming, with the ruling finding the CFO lose double criminality aspect of the extradition case and the Canadian judge is considering whether to proceed with extradition.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen gave up some gains despite mounting pressures from the US and China, which MUFG says is “yet to derail the ongoing improvement in risk sentiment on a more sustained basis”. Meanwhile in Japan, PM Abe lifted the state of emergency recently and is aiming to completely reopen from August.</p><p><strong>EMFX</strong>: EMFX was generally softer against the dollar amid a mixed risk appetite due to global relations (China/US) while economic reopening hopes battled against the souring relations. The BRL however was much firmer today continuing on from prior day gains, MXN was weaker today but both the BRL and MXN are performing well on the week after several weeks of weakness. Meanwhile, the Banxico QIR expects to see growth -4.6% in 2020, but +4.1% in 2021, it noted the balance of inflation risks is still uncertain but it has raised its Q4 inflation view to 3.5 from 3.2% and its core inflation view to 3.8% from 3.0%.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Energy futures traded in the red on Wednesday as recent bullish sentiment pared amid Hong Kong woes and less supportive OPEC+ comments. The losses were most acute heading into the US session. The combination of Chinese companies taking steps to move away from US exchanges and reports that China was to implement import bans on coal, saw risk assets come under pressure – energy was no outlier. However, front-month energy futures did come off its lows – for WTI at 32.18 and Brent at 34.26 – alongside other risk assets later into the afternoon. On the supply front, IEA said that the COVID-19 crisis is causing the biggest decline in global energy investment in history, saying that global investment in energy is to drop 20%, or by USD 400bln, this year vs its previous forecast of 2% growth. Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO said he expects oil demand to be -10% this year, and natgas -5%. Meanwhile, the Kremlin noted that Russian President Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince spoke on the phone and agreed on further coordination on oil output cuts – this followed earlier reports that Russia prefers to stick to with the existing cuts rather than deepen cuts beyond June. Looking ahead, the weekly US energy inventories are to be released tomorrow, with the private data later this evening, due to the market holiday on Monday causing a one-day postponement of the releases; current expectations (bbls):&nbsp;crude -1.9mln, distillate +1.8mln, gasoline +0.1mln.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The Single Currency took the top spot among G10 gainers following on the back of a EUR 750bln formed of 2/3 grants and the rest loans in a bid to shore up consensus among divided states. That being said, a Dutch official already voiced concerns as “positions are far apart” and played down the prospect of a swift unanimous agreement. ECB President Lagarde did little to dent the EUR but posited that the ECB’s mild GDP scenario of -5% is outdated – with the metric likely in the range of the medium (-8%) to severe (-12%) scenarios. Nonetheless EUR/USD remained choppy throughout the day and traded on either side 1.1000, having briefly breached its 200DMA (1.1011) to a high of 1.1030 (vs. low 1.0935). Traders will keep eyes on rhetoric across EU members to gauge the likelihood of consensus. Tomorrow’s docket sees German prelim CPI and the economic sentiment survey.</p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>Choppy trade for the broader Dollar and Index throughout the session, as DXY fluctuated on either side of 99.000 having printed a base at 98.713 and a ceiling at 99.350 amid influence from the EUR, the largest basket contributor. Meanwhile, the Yuan continued to decline throughout the day amid heightened tensions with the US and social pressure from Hong Kong. USD/CNY rose to a whisker from 7.1600 (vs. low 7.1350) with the PBOC issued a firmer fix after the dollar decline. USD/CNH resides closer to 7.1800 (vs. low 7.1430) ahead of its record high at 7.1965 as the EU close looms. From a macro perspective, potential US-Sino rhetoric/action will be at the forefront with the NPC congregation concluded.</p><p><strong>GBP, JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The marked laggard on the day heading into the end of the European session. GBP remained subdued throughout the day with EUR strength weighing on the cross before Brexit pessimism took the helm and knocked Cable back below its 21 and 50 DMAs (1.2312 and 1.2289 respectively) to a low of 1.2255. The Yen and the Franc experienced a dichotomy for a large part of EU trade. Early-doors Franc weakness raised suspicion of SNB intervention, whilst President Jordan later stressed readiness to intervene and cut rates if needed. EUR/CHF took out 1.0650 to the upside to test 1.0700 to the upside (vs. low 1.0590) – more so a function of EUR strength, whilst USD/CHF remained contained within recent ranges.</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD, CAD</strong></p><p>High beta-FX also saw USD-induced volatility throughout the session albeit the pairs fell into negative territory amid reports two Chinese companies are pushing with share sales in Hong Kong given US pressure for Chinese companies to disclose information if not delist – signaling and escalation in tensions. AUD fell to the bottom of the pile with another report regarding potential Chinese coal restrictions also weighing on the currency. AUD/USD retreated below its 200 DMA and looks to end the EU day towards the bottom of a 0.6600-79 range. Similarly, NZD/USD fell below its 100 DMA (0.6203) to and resides around session lows (intraday band 0.6177-0.6230). The Loonie remains sub-1.3800 vs. the USD as it eyes its 100DMA at 1.3702 (range 1.3723-1.3805) heading into the end of European trade.</p><p><strong>EMs</strong></p><p>Broad weakness was seen across EM FX, potentially a retracement of yesterday’s sentiment-led gains, albeit softness in the Yuan may have contributed. However, the BRL bucks the trends with some pointing to potential BCB intervention after the Central Bank president reaffirmed the bank’s readiness to dip into reserves against the backdrop of coronavirus cases and political scandals threatening the currency. USD/BRL looks to end the EU session at lows sub-5.3000 having traded in a 5.2727-5.3604 parameter.</p>",

Sectors are mixed, with Financials and Industrials continuing on prior day gains while Technology, Health Care and Communications lag. Treasury yields are lower by 1-2bps across the curve with a flattening bias (Treasury sells 5-year notes at 1pm EDT). Sentiment is tilting towards risk-off in FX; the USD is flat/slightly higher (despite some month-end models project USD selling into the end of the week), risk-sensitive FX pairs (including EMFX) are lower. Meanwhile, crude benchmarks are red ahead of inventory data (crude stocks expected to draw 2.5mln, distillates are seen building 1.3mln, gasoline is seen flat).</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Social Media names (FB, TWTR) are facing scrutiny from US President Trump, who tweeted “we will strongly regulate, or close them down” before they “totally silence conservatives voices”. Tesla (TSLA) cut the prices of its entire vehicle line by between USD 2000-5000. Boeing (BA) is to announce 2500 voluntary layoffs. Disney (DIS) will submit a proposal today for a phased reopening of its parks. Alphabet (GOOG) is being looked into by India’s anti-trust body after allegations that it is abusing its market position to unfairly promote mobile payments applications in India. Amazon (AMZN) is to acquire self-driving car technology company Zoox for less than its USD 2.3bln valuation. General Electric (GE) is to sell its lightbulb business for USD 250mln. Dominos (DPZ) and Papa John’s (PZZA) provided positive updates with decent SSS. Cruise lines (CCL, NCLH, RCL) are continuing their rally from yesterday. AT&amp;T (T) is to launch its HBO Max streaming service today.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Ralph Lauren (RL) reported a larger loss per share than expected, although revenue beat. It also suspended all of its current guidance due to uncertainty. Total SSS beat estimates (-17%, exp. 19.3%). RL announced it has reopened roughly two-thirds of its Europe stores and nearly half of its North American stores through the last half of May. KeySight (KEYS) reported an EPS and revenue miss, notes Q3 to be in line or a bit better than Q2.</p><p><strong>CORPORATE EVENTS/EARNINGS: </strong>FB, TWTR and AMZN have shareholder meetings today, as well as a handful of oil majors (XOM, CVX, MPC). On the earnings front, On Wednesday and Thursday, numbers from retail names will offer insight into consumer spending in the last quarter. RL on Wednesday (0800 EDT); on Thursday, JWN COST, DG and DLTR are due. What may be more useful to traders than the actual numbers for the quarter is commentary about revenue trends, particularly the performance of online segments, and relating to how sales are doing after re-openings, analysts say.</p><p><strong>FALLING VOL AND REBOUNDING ACTIVITY COULD TRIGGER BUY SIGNAL: </strong>Barclays says institutional investors remain unimpressed by the strong equity market, noting that outflows continued in May with hedge funds and systematic funds not increasing exposure much. \"This might change soon, as the mix of falling volatility and rebounding activity could trigger a 'buy signal, and revive FOMO,\" the bank says, noting that market internals have turned more pro-cyclical of late. Barclays thinks this 'risk-on' rotation might have legs as mutual funds remain highly defensive and Value has recently undershot bond yields. In the medium-term, Barclays says dovish central banks and geopolitical tail risks will likely continue to cap bond yield upside.</p>",

Instead, the composition of today’s movers and shakers across the continents takes a similar form to those yesterday with travel &amp; leisure names continuing to benefit from ongoing reopening optimism with recent easing of lockdown measures not currently triggering any material pick-up in COVID-19 cases/deaths in the region. As such, Tui AG (+20.4%) sit at the top of the leaderboard once again with IAG (+4.2%) shares also extending on yesterday’s gains and the troubled cruise-line sector seeing some reprieve with Carnival shares up over 8%. Elsewhere, banking names are firmer this morning, in-fitting with price action in their transatlantic counterparts yesterday on Wall St. with upside seen for the likes of RBS (+8.6%), BNP Paribas (+8.4%), SocGen (+9.4%), Barclays (+7.8%), Commerzbank (+7.7%), BBVA (+4.6%). Renault (+15.2%) and Peugeot (+8.2%) are benefiting from yesterday’s announcement of a EUR 8bln support package from the French government with the former also reportedly mulling potential cost savings of EUR 2bln by 2024. To the downside, underperformance can be seen in defensive names with health care the laggard in Europe, whilst IT names are also seen lower with Infineon (-2.0%) shares hampered by the Co.’s decision to raise capital.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY, CNY/CNH -</strong> Consolidation saw the DXY back with a 99.000 handle in APAC trade following yesterday’s heavy selling. The index remains choppy throughout the session as it hit a high of 99.350 before declining on initial details of European Recovery Fund, with losses prompting the DXY to relinquish the round figure to a low of 98.710. Meanwhile, the Yuan continued to decline through late APAC hours after US President Trump said US actions regarding China will be unveiled by the end of the week, whilst sources noted US is mulling sanctions on Chinese officials and firms over Hong Kong. USD/CNY rise to a whisker from 7.1600 (vs. low 7.1350) with the PBOC issued a firmer fix after the dollar decline. USD/CNY sees its 2019 peak at 7.1844 whilst its offshore counterpart resides north of 7.1700 (vs. low 7.1430) ahead of its record high at 7.1965. Focus today will remain on US-Sino developments alongside the unveiling of the EC Recovery Fund proposal.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP -</strong> The Single Currency fought back against the Dollar after reports emerged the European Commission is to propose EUR 750bln for the European Recovery Fund, comprising of EUR 500bln in grants and EUR 250bln in loans. ECB President Lagarde did little to dent the EUR but posited that the ECB’s mild GDP scenario of -5% is outdated – with the metric likely in the range of the medium (-8%) to severe (-12%) scenarios. ECB aside, eyes are on the unveiling of the European Recovery Fund later in the day, with focus on sentiment across EU members, namely the North and South, as the Commission’s proposal is unveiled. EUR/USD took out the 1.1000 handle alongside its 200 DMA (1.1011) having topped its 100 DMA (1.0957) and with EUR 1bln option expiries scattered between 1.0950-60, with a further EUR 1.8bln around 1.0990-1.1000.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Sterling remains lethargic around 1.2300 vs. the USD as overnight weakness emanated from reports UK Chancellor Sunak is set to announce this week that the government will soon stop allowing companies from placing employees on the furlough scheme. Cable trades in the middle of a 1.2290-1.2350 parameter ahead of a potential barrier at 1.2360 (50% Fib from 30 Apr-18 May move).</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong> - High-beta FX largely mirrors USD action, but the Kiwi outperforms as the AUD/NZD cross homes in on the 1.0700 mark to the downside. Meanwhile the Loonie and Aussie initially eke mild gains before the Dollar saw broad losses. NZD/USD reclaimed 0.6200 and topped its 100 DMA around 0.6203 (vs low 0.6175). The Aussie hoverd on either side of 0.6650 before taking out its 200 DMA (0.6658) to the upside and matching yesterday’s high prints at 0.6675. USD/CAD holds onto a bulk of yesterday’s losses and remains sub-1.3800, with the next support point seen at the psychological 1.3750 ahead of 1.3700 mark which coincides with the pair’s 100DMA.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF -</strong> Mixed trade for the traditional safe-haven FX with considerable weakness seen in the Franc relative to the peers amid potential SNB presence. EUR/CHF eyes 1.0650 to the upside whilst USD/CHF trades north of 0.9700 vs. lows of 1.0587 and 0.9650 respectively. The JPY meanwhile remains flat on either side of 107.50 and within a tight 25-pip or so range awaiting fresh fundamental developments and a clear risk tone.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>After a relatively contained start to the session for core counterparts, which for the most part saw some choppiness across the debt space but ultimately nothing too drastic. However, price action was spurred more recently, initially largely within the periphery, on reports that the Commission are to mobilise EUR 750bln for the fund, with EUR 500bln in grants and EUR 250bln in loans; such a proposal exceeds the original EUR 500bln Merkel-Macron proposal and unsurprisingly has been beneficial to the periphery with<strong> BTPs</strong> and <strong>Bonos </strong>printing session highs around 142.00 (as such, sending the yield below 1.5% -albeit, relatively short lived) and 156.00 respectively. Focus ahead will now be on whether the reports hold true, reception amongst the EU nations (particularly the ‘frugal four’, as this appears to be a compromise between their proposal and the Franco-German one) and the allocation of funds. On this last topic, earlier reports highlighted that 20% of the EUR 500bln was earmarked for Italy. Within the core, and referring to <strong>Bunds</strong> in particular, significant downward price action was subsequently seen as overall sentiment strengthened as well as conflicting, and ultimately corrected, reports relating to associated debt issuance. Technically speaking, Bunds dropped into negative territory on the day but still remain firm above the 172.00 handle, which also coincides with near-term support at 172.01. From a spread perspective, <strong>BTP-Bund</strong> differential has narrowed further to 192bp so far compared to circa 200bp region earlier in the session; a spread which takes us back to early April/late March. Note, timings for the formal unveiling are still unknown but Commission President von der Leyen is due to speak at 12:30BST. Stateside, <strong>USTs</strong> are weighed on in sympathy with their EU counterparts – with not too much to shout about on the US schedule itself for the session, with further supply via a 5-year note after yesterday’s well received 2-year perhaps the highlight; alongside, Fed’s Bullard. Currently, the curve us essentially unchanged on the day.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures see a session of modest losses thus far as the July contracts hover around USD 34/bbl and USD 35.75/bbl respectively – both within tight ranges of less that USD 1/bbl, and seemingly deriving support from general sentiment. Eyes now turn to the upcoming OPEC meeting starting June 9th, a day after the proposed JMMC meeting – with focus on the producer’s assessment of the oil market and effectiveness of the current output pact. Participant will also be on the lookout for countries that voice for an extension of current curtailments. Aside from that, US-China developments remain in focus whist the EC Recovery Fund proposal could prove a sentiment risk for complex, whilst the weekly Private Inventory figures will be released later today on account of Monday’s Memorial Day Holiday<strong>. Spot gold</strong> prices mirrors USD action and threatens a test of USD 1700/oz to the downside (vs high USD 1715/oz). <strong>Copper</strong> prices tracked Chinese stocks and the yuan as US-China tensions continue to mount.</p><p>IEA said the coronavirus crisis is causing the biggest decline in global energy investment in history in which it sees global investment in energy to drop 20% or by USD 400bln this year vs. Prev. forecast of 2% growth, while it added governments and the industry is to lose well over USD 1tln in energy revenue this year.

However, price action was spurred more recently, initially largely within the periphery, on reports that the Commission are to mobilise EUR 750bln for the fund, with EUR 500bln in grants and EUR 250bln in loans; such a proposal exceeds the original EUR 500bln Merkel-Macron proposal and unsurprisingly has been beneficial to the periphery with <strong>BTPs</strong> and <strong>Bonos</strong> printing session highs around 142.00 (as such, sending the yield below 1.5% -albeit, relatively short lived) and 156.00 respectively. Focus ahead will now be on whether the reports hold true, reception amongst the EU nations (particularly the ‘frugal four’, as this appears to be a compromise between their proposal and the Franco-German one) and the allocation of funds. On this last topic, earlier reports highlighted that 20% of the EUR 500bln was earmarked for Italy. Within the core, and referring to Bunds in particular, significant downward price action was subsequently seen as overall sentiment strengthened as well as conflicting, and ultimately corrected, reports relating to associated debt issuance. Technically speaking, Bunds dropped into negative territory on the day but still remain firm above the 172.00 handle, which also coincides with near-term support at 172.01. From a spread perspective, <strong>BTP-Bund</strong> differential has narrowed further to 192bp so far compared to circa 200bp region earlier in the session; a spread which takes us back to early April/late March. Note, timings for the formal unveiling are still unknown but Commission President von der Leyen is due to speak at 12:30BST. Stateside, <strong>USTs</strong> are weighed on in sympathy with their EU counterparts – with not too much to shout about on the US schedule itself for the session, with further supply via a 5-year note after yesterday’s well received 2-year perhaps the highlight; alongside, Fed’s Bullard. Currently, the curve us essentially unchanged on the day.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures see a session of modest losses thus far as the July contracts hover around USD 34/bbl and USD 35.75/bbl respectively – both within tight ranges of less that USD 1/bbl, and seemingly deriving support from general sentiment. Eyes now turn to the upcoming OPEC meeting starting June 9th, a day after the proposed JMMC meeting – with focus on the producer’s assessment of the oil market and effectiveness of the current output pact. Participant will also be on the lookout for countries that voice for an extension of current curtailments. Aside from that, US-China developments remain in focus whist the EC Recovery Fund proposal could prove a sentiment risk for complex, whilst the weekly Private Inventory figures will be released later today on account of Monday’s Memorial Day Holiday. <strong>Spot gold</strong> prices mirrors USD action and threatens a test of USD 1700/oz to the downside (vs high USD 1715/oz). <strong>Copper</strong> prices tracked Chinese stocks and the yuan as US-China tensions continue to mount.</p>",

European commission is to propose an EU budget worth 1.1tln along with the Recovery Fund, sources state.</p><p><strong>WHAT’S NEXT: </strong>Eyes now turn to sentiment among EU members, with the so -called Frugal Four (Austria, Denmark, Netherlands and Sweden) all against the proposal of loans. Meanwhile, at first glance it seems like the compromise was mostly on the counterproposal. Unanimous backing is needed to pass the package, thus tail risks remain. <strong>European Commission President Von der Leyen will unveil the Commission’s Recovery Fund (RF) proposal later today (timing TBC). </strong>European Council President Michel has to broker final accord – with a meeting between tomorrow and the 11th June Eurogroup yet to be scheduled.</p><p><strong>PERIPHERIES:</strong> Bonds in the periphery cheered the news on the prospect of receiving aid without ballooning existing debt. Earlier it was reported 20% of the EUR 500bln EU recovery fund could reportedly be allocated to Italy, La Repubblica; Plan will be greater than the original Franco-German proposal of EUR 500bln. Italian, Spanish and Portugal’s 10yr yields fell to 8-week lows whilst stock markets received tailwind. In terms of the breakdown.</p><ul><li><strong>Greece</strong>: EUR 22.5bln</li><li><strong>Spain</strong>: EUR 77.3bln (grants) &amp; EUR 63bln (loans)</li><li><strong>France</strong>: EUR 39.0bln</li><li><strong>Italy:</strong> EUR 82.0bln (grants) &amp; EUR 91bln (loans)</li></ul><p>NOTE: Spanish PM Sanchez recently opposed a loan-based RF as it over-indebts peripheries such as Spain and Italy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FRANCO-GERMAN PROPOSAL: </strong>The nations proposed a fund of EUR 500bln of grants not loans - and will be borrowed on the market with the Commission’s AAA rating to get favourable interest rates. This proposal posits that the distribution will take place through the EU long term budget for 2021-27. In terms of wide implications, the Franco-German proposal includes the introduction of a digital tax in the EU alongside a Common Corporate Tax Base, i.e. rules on what to tax the tech companies on as opposed to the amount taxed. The final accord will have to be brokered by European Council President, with no meeting between May 27th and 11th June (Eurogroup meeting) yet scheduled.</p><p><strong>FRUGAL FOUR PROPOSAL:</strong> The four Northern European countries rejected the notion of grants in the proposal, as expected, and recommended an emergency fund financed only by loans. The proposal also does not permit for Commission issuance to increase the volume of financial resources available in the EU Budget – it proposes reprioritising and frontloading the existing EU Budget resources. Spanish PM Sanchez recently opposed a loan-based RF as it over-indebts peripheries such as Spain and Italy.</p>",

Whether that can last into the end of the week, remains to be seen, given that we are expecting a US response to China’s HK security law. Nevertheless, for today, European equities are higher (Financials and Telecoms leading; Health Care and Tech lagging), and futures have added to gains. Treasury yields are flat, though the bias of major curve spreads are flatter (Treasury <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-new-2-year-usd-44bln-tue-new-5-year-usd-45bln-wed-and-a-new-7-year-usd-38bln-thu-this-week-25-05-2020\">will sell 5-year notes today</a>).

Meanwhile, crude benchmarks are red ahead of inventory data (crude stocks expected to draw 2.5mln, distillates are seen building 1.3mln, gasoline is seen flat); RBC says the losses are a result of the market focus on how quickly fuel demand might recover with the easing of lockdowns, while US-China tensions over Hong Kong also added to negative sentiment.</p><p><strong>CORPORATE EVENTS/EARNINGS: </strong>FB, TWTR and AMZN have shareholder meetings today, as well as a handful of oil majors (XOM, CVX, MPC). On the earnings front, On Wednesday and Thursday, numbers from retail names will offer insight into consumer spending in the last quarter. RL on Wednesday (0800 EDT); on Thursday, JWN COST, DG and DLTR are due. What may be more useful to traders than the actual numbers for the quarter is commentary about revenue trends, particularly the performance of online segments, and relating to how sales are doing after re-openings, analysts say.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>Be attentive to ‘stimulus’ headlines as the Europeans unveil its <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/european-commission-is-to-reportedly-mobilise-eur-750bln-for-the-european-recovery-fund-comprising-of-eur-500bln-in-grants-and-eur-250bln-in-loans-according-to-dpa-27-05-2020\">relief package</a>, which doesn’t seem to enjoy universal consensus across the bloc; European Commission President von Der Leyen will give remarks at 1230 BST/0730 EDT. The Japanese are also talking more stimulus. US lawmakers are also mixed on the need for more stimulus; yesterday, McConnell suggested that another bill might be needed, though he again leaned back on the House Democrats USD 3trln bill; there seems to be a loose consensus among analysts that the next tranche will be sized around USD 1trln.</p><p><strong>REOPENINGS:</strong> NYSE re-opened floor trading on Tuesday, although it’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyses-floor-to-reopen-with-masks-coronavirus-waivers-and-handshake-ban-11590404400\">not ‘back to normal’</a>; the CBOE has said Chicago floor trade will resume on 8th June. Apple (AAPL) yesterday said it would reopen 100 of its stores. Today, Disney (DIS) will outline a proposal to reopen its theme parks (executive gives presentation at 10am EDT). The re-opening theme has supported risk sentiment recently, analysts say, despite valuations running hot and fundamentals weak.</p><p><strong>JPM’S DIMON: </strong>It is worth re-capping some of the highlights from Dimon’s remarks on Tuesday. Following JPM’s Q1 reserve build (of USD 6.8bln), Dimon said Q2 would also see a substantial addition to reserves of a size comparable to Q1, but this would not happen in Q3 and Q4; the consensus was that banks would continue reserve builds through the end of the year. Analysts have said that banks’ aggressive reserve building was a negative catalyst for stock market upside, and Dimon’s suggestions seemingly remove one (of the many) hurdles to the upside, but other banks will need to say similar for confirmation. Dimon defended the bank’s dividend in light of gentle prodding from US authorities (the recent Fed minutes highlighted that some officials thought banks should be cutting dividends and buybacks to preserve capital – we have seen similar in Europe, albeit with less of a subtle approach from authorities). Dimon also said trading revenues were coming in just as strong as Q1 levels (echoing what we heard from Deutsche Bank this week, too).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FALLING VOL AND REBOUNDING ACTIVITY COULD TRIGGER BUY SIGNAL: </strong>Barclays says institutional investors remain unimpressed by the strong equity market, noting that outflows continued in May with hedge funds and systematic funds not increasing exposure much. \"This might change soon, as the mix of falling volatility and rebounding activity could trigger a 'buy signal, and revive FOMO,\" the bank says, noting that market internals have turned more pro-cyclical of late. Barclays thinks this 'risk-on' rotation might have legs as mutual funds remain highly defensive and Value has recently undershot bond yields. In the medium-term, Barclays says dovish central banks and geopolitical tail risks will likely continue to cap bond yield upside.</p>",

However, price action was spurred more recently, initially largely within the periphery, on reports that the Commission are to mobilise EUR 750bln for the fund, with EUR 500bln in grants and EUR 250bln in loans; such a proposal exceeds the original EUR 500bln Merkel-Macron proposal and unsurprisingly has been beneficial to the periphery with BTPs and Bonos printing session highs around 142.00 (as such, sending the yield below 1.5%) and 156.00 respectively. Focus ahead will now be on whether the reports hold true, reception amongst the EU nations (particularly the ‘frugal four’, as this appears to be a compromise between their proposal and the Franco-German one) and the allocation of funds. On this last topic, earlier reports highlighted that 20% of the EUR 500bln was earmarked for Italy. Within the core, and referring to Bunds in particular, significant downward price action was subsequently seen as overall sentiment strengthened as well as conflicting, and ultimately corrected, reports relating to associated debt issuance. Technically speaking, Bunds dropped into negative territory on the day but still remain firm above the 172.00 handle, which also coincides with near-term support at 172.01. From a spread perspective, BTP-Bund differential has narrowed further to 192bp so far compared to circa 200bp region earlier in the session; a spread which takes us back to early April/late March. Note, timings for the formal unveiling are still unknown but Commission President von der Leyen is due to speak at 12:30BST – <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24622/download\">newsquawk preview available here.</a> Stateside, USTs are weighed on in sympathy with their EU counterparts – with not too much to shout about on the US schedule itself for the session, with further supply via a 5-year note after yesterday’s well received 2-year perhaps the highlight; alongside, Fed’s Bullard. Currently, the curve us essentially unchanged on the day.</p>",

Meanwhile, at first glance it seems like the compromise was mostly on the counterproposal. Unanimous backing is needed to pass the package, thus tail risks remain. European Commission President Von der Leyen will unveil the Commission’s Recovery Fund (RF) proposal later today (timing TBC). European Council President Michel has to broker final accord – with a meeting between tomorrow and the 11th June Eurogroup yet to be scheduled.</p><p>PERIPHERIES: Bonds in the periphery cheered the news on the prospect of receiving aid without ballooning existing debt. Earlier it was reported 20% of the EUR 500bln EU recovery fund could reportedly be allocated to Italy, La Repubblica; Plan will be greater than the original Franco-German proposal of EUR 500bln. Italian, Spanish and Portugal’s 10yr yields fell to 8-week lows whilst stock markets received tailwind.</p><p><strong>FRANCO-GERMAN PROPOSAL: </strong>The nations proposed a fund of EUR 500bln of grants not loans - and will be borrowed on the market with the Commission’s AAA rating to get favourable interest rates. This proposal posits that the distribution will take place through the EU long term budget for 2021-27. In terms of wide implications, the Franco-German proposal includes the introduction of a digital tax in the EU alongside a Common Corporate Tax Base, i.e. rules on what to tax the tech companies on as opposed to the amount taxed. The final accord will have to be brokered by European Council President, with no meeting between May 27th and 11th June (Eurogroup meeting) yet scheduled.</p><p><strong>FRUGAL FOUR PROPOSAL:</strong> The four Northern European countries rejected the notion of grants in the proposal, as expected, and recommended an emergency fund financed only by loans. The proposal also does not permit for Commission issuance to increase the volume of financial resources available in the EU Budget – it proposes reprioritising and frontloading the existing EU Budget resources. Spanish PM Sanchez recently opposed a loan-based RF as it over-indebts peripheries such as Spain and Italy.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, CNY/CNH</strong></p><p>Consolidation saw the DXY back with a 99.000 handle in APAC trade following yesterday’s heavy selling which prompted index to briefly breach its 100 DMA to the downside around the psychological 99.000 to a 98.900 low. Meanwhile, the Yuan continued to decline through late APAC hours after US President Trump said US actions regarding China will be unveiled by the end of the week, whilst sources noted US is mulling sanctions on Chinese officials and firms over Hong Kong. USD/CNY rise to a whisker from 7.1600 (vs. low 7.1350) with the PBOC issued a firmer fix after the dollar decline. USD/CNY sees its 2019 peak at 7.1844 whilst its offshore counterpart resides north of 7.1700 (vs. low 7.1430) ahead of its record high at 7.1965. Focus today will remain on US-Sino developments alongside the unveiling of the EC Recovery Fund proposal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>The Single Currency traded on the softer side of a 1.0950-1.0990 band in APAC hours and in tandem with the Dollar DXY takes a breather. ECB President Lagarde did little to dent the EUR but posited that the ECB’s mild GDP scenario of -5% is outdated – with the metric likely in the range of the medium (-8%) to severe (-12%) scenarios. ECB aside, eyes are on the unveiling of the European Recovery Fund later in the day, with focus on sentiment across EU members, namely the North and South, as the Commission’s proposal is unveiled. EUR/USD meanders around 1.0975 having topped its 100 DMA (1.0957) and with EUR 1bln option expiries scattered between 1.0950-60, with a further EUR 1.8bln around 1.0990-1.1000.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Sterling remains lacklustre around 1.2300 vs. the USD as overnight weakness emanated from reports UK Chancellor Sunak is set to announce this week that the government will soon stop allowing companies from placing employees on the furlough scheme. Cable trades in the middle of a 1.2290-1.2350 parameter ahead of a potential barrier at 1.2360 (50% Fib from 30 Apr-18 May move).</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>High-beta FX largely mirrors USD action, but the Kiwi outperforms as the AUD/NZD cross homes in on the 1.0700 mark to the downside. Meanwhile the Loonie and Aussie eke mild gains in anticipation for the next catalyst. NZD/USD reclaimed 0.6200 and remains north of its 100 DMA around 0.6203 (vs low 0.6175). The Aussie hovers on either side of 0.6650 having tested its 200 DMA (0.6658) to the upside, albeit yesterday’s high prints at 0.6675. USD/CAD holds onto a bulk of yesterday’s losses and remains sub-1.3800, with the next support point seen at the psychological 1.3750 ahead of 1.3700 mark which coincides with the pair’s 100DMA.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Mixed trade for the traditional safe-haven FX with considerable weakness seen in the Franc relative to the peers amid potential SNB presence. EUR/CHF eyes 1.0650 to the upside whilst USD/CHF trades north of 0.9700 vs. lows of 1.0587 and 0.9650 respectively. The JPY meanwhile remains flat on either side of 107.50 and within a tight 25-pip or so range awaiting fresh fundamental developments and a clear risk tone.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) declined heavily at the open with the index pressured by weakness in the metals complex and underperformance in gold miners, although strength in energy and financials provided a cushion to help the index retrace the initial losses. Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is temperamental with a mild improvement in the risk appetite seen after initial details of the 2nd extra budget were announced which is valued at JPY 117.1tln and will include direct spending of JPY 72.7tln, while PM Abe suggested they will provide JPY 140tln in financial support to companies. Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp.

USD/JPY is rangebound and JPY-crosses are pressured as the indecisiveness benefits both the greenback as its Japanese counterpart, while antipodeans are constrained by their high-beta statuses and with CNH offered on the US-China tensions.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower despite the tentativeness in the region with prices subdued amid the lack of BoJ presence in the markets and amid anticipation of increased supply with Japan’s 2nd extra budget to involve an additional JPY 31.9tln of JGB issuances.</p>",

Furthermore, reports added the Treasury department could impose controls transactions and freeze assets of Chinese officials and businesses for implementing the new national security law, while the White House earlier stated that President Trump is displeased with China's efforts and it's hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub if China takes over.
