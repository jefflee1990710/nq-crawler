Additionally, investors are facing less meat on the bone as corporates begin to slash/cut dividends and pullback on share repurchases, the posterchild of the cycle’s growth engine. Xerox (XRX) announced it is to drop its hostile USD 35bln bid for HP Inc. (HPQ) due to the coronavirus pandemic, therefore it has withdrawn its tender offer and will no longer look to nominate its slate of candidates to HPQ’s board. Following the announcement, JP Morgan issued a note stating it is a mild positive for HPQ and it can now “prudently” resume its USD 5bln share repurchase program in May. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) completed its merger agreement. Apple Inc. (AAPL) supplier Foxconn (2317 TT) assured investors that the 5G iPhone can still launch this Autumn following some speculation there could be a delay. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) has filed for chapter 11. The Co noted it has over USD 585mln of cash on its balance sheet and it will continue operations in normal course. US President Trump is to meet with US oil company (CVX, XOM, OXY) CEO’s on Friday to discuss aid to the industry amid the current conditions. Note, earlier reports suggested President Trump's administration was planning to lease spaces for energy companies to store oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Deere (DE) announced it renewed its revolving credit lines in an aggregate amount of USD 8bln, Grainger (GWW) announced it has drawn down USD 1bln form its unsecured revolving credit facility. Raytheon (RTN) is to be replaced in the S&amp;P 500 after its merger with United Tech. (UTX) to form Raytheon Technologies (RTX) on the 3rd April open, where Otis Worldwide (OTIS), a spin-off Co of UTX, will replace RTN. While Macy’s (M) will be replaced by Carrier Global (CARR), also a spin-off of UTX. The spin offs were part of the merger agreement. Verizon (VZ) were upgraded to Conviction Buy from Buy at Goldman Sachs, while Comcast (CMCSA) were downgraded to Buy from Conviction Buy and AT&amp;T (T) were downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan. SPX -4.31% at 2473, NDX -4.19% at 7486, DJIA -4.44% at 20944.</p><p>The TPLEX flattened amid a stock sell-off and issuance weighted towards the front. The T-Note caught its bid overnight and faded off its highs as Europeans left for the session. Desks noted that real money remained an aggressive seller into the Fed’s buy-back operations, where the T-Note rolled lower in the later part of the session alongside a high offer-to-cover ratio in the Fed’s 7- to 20-year maturity operation, perhaps a signal participants are happier to sell their UST holdings at these rates. It also may be ahead of Thursday, where the Fed will taper back its UST purchases from USD 75bln to 60bln a day, where there could be some front-running any perceived sell-off as the Fed begins to step back. Furthermore, corporates continue to swamp the issuance channels, including some European’s coming to the Dollar market on Wednesday – USD 6bln from AB InBev (10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) and USD 5bln from Equinor (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s). Elsewhere, note that the Fed’s RRP saw a fall in demand to USD 207.83bln across less counterparties, coinciding with slightly firmer GC rates, while the regular O/N repo operation in the morning saw zero bids, and a marginal amount in the afternoon. By settlement the curve was flatter, 2s unch. at 0.23%, 10s -6.5bps at 0.63%, 30s -6.5bps at 1.29%. TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-note (m0) futures settled 9+ ticks higher at 138-31+.</p>",

Additionally, investors are facing less meat on the bone as corporates begin to slash/cut dividends and pullback on share repurchases, the posterchild of the cycle’s growth engine. UBS notes the high uncertainty on the scope of the economic damage as gauged by the wide dispersion of stock index price targets being set by analysts; the bank on Wednesday cut its 2020 S&amp;P 500 EPS estimate to USD 140 (prev. 170), with a year-end index level target of 2,850, saying the index will remain pressured until earnings expectations find a footing. Near-term Dollar demand continues to remain relaxed with xccy basis swaps in Eur, Jpy and Gbp now in positive territory and heading above normal levels, while the Fed’s O/N repo operation saw zero bids in the morning, albeit RRP saw less demand as GC rates were marginally firmer.</p><h2>CASE COUNT</h2><p><strong>WORLDWIDE CASES 925,053, DEATHS 46,399, RECOVERED 193,431.</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Wednesday (via worldometer website) against Tuesday:</p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>total cases 209,105 (prev. 188,530), death toll 4,658 (prev. 4,053).</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 110,574 (prev. 105,792), death toll 13,155 (prev. 12,428).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 102,179 (prev. 95,923), death toll 9,131 (prev. 8,464).</li><li><strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 81,554 (prev. 81,518), death toll 3,312 (prev. 3,305).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 77,779 (prev. 71,808), death toll 909 (prev. 775).</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 56,989 (prev. 52,128), death toll 4,032 (prev. 3,523).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>total cases 29,474 (prev. 25,150), death toll 2,352 (prev. 1,789).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>total cases 17,768 (prev. 16,605), death toll 488 (prev. 433).</li><li><strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 13,614 (prev. 12,595), death toll 1,173 (prev. 1,039).</li><li><strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 9,887 (prev. 9,786), death toll 165 (prev. 162).</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 9,489 (prev. 8,612), death toll 108 (prev. 101).</li></ul><p><i>Note figures are provided via </i><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\"><i>worldometers</i></a><i> thus there may be some discrepancies on figures provided against those stated from individual states.</i></p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, on CNBC, said the President is in favour of infrastructure stimulus and low rates are important to the administration for such; expects there will be more stimulus bills. The Treasury Sec. was pressed on progress of the next bill, to which he noted execution of the stimulus just passed remains the priority, although talks on infrastructure are ongoing.<strong> </strong>US House Speaker Pelosi said the House should be able to move on to the infrastructure bill shortly after the planned return to session on April 20th; adding that the plan is similar to the USD 760bln over five years that was announced in January but there could be changes.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>The White House issued 30-day social distancing guidelines and President Trump commented that following the guidelines for the next 30 days is a matter of life and death, while he also suggested that there is light at the end of the tunnel but we will go through a painful 2 weeks. It was also reported that the US emergency medical stockpile is nearly out of protective equipment to combat coronavirus. Meanwhile, as previously suggested, Trump is to suspend certain tariffs payments for 90-days on imports such as apparel and light trucks, although it will not include some of the high-profile tariffs including the metals tariffs and punitive tariffs on USD 360bln of imports from China.</p><h2>REST OF WORLD</h2><p><strong>EUROPEAN STIMULUS:</strong> EU Commission is mulling EUR 100bln for an EU-funded short-time work scheme, although the overall figure may change; the official noted the scheme would borrow on the market against guarantees from EU countries, not against budgets, and would be available to all EU countries. The FT reported also that the EC will, on Thursday, approve an instrument named 'SURE' that will allow the provision of back-to-back loans to economies which are seeing quick increases in spending on short-time working schemes. French Finance Minister Le Maire, as according to the FT, is seeking a common EU fund to assist Europe through the virus crisis; however, the proposal would have a limited span of 5-10 years. Meanwhile, the Italian Economy Minister said that Italy is working on a concrete proposal for an EU level common debt instrument (coronabonds). ECB's Weidmann said he is still sceptical of Eurobonds, according to De Zeit; adding one way to help countries is the ESM's credit line.</p><p><strong>GERMAN </strong>government is planning up to EUR 30bln guarantees for the commercial credit insurance industry, according to sources. In return for guarantees, insurers would give up nearly 2/3 of their 2020 premiums. The plan has been agreed in principle between German government and credit insurance industry but would need approval from the EU commission.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN RESTRICTIONS: </strong>German Chancellor Merkel noted social distancing will be maintained until April 19th, which will be re-evaluated on the Tuesday after Easter – noting that the country is far off from achieving what it needs to. French PM Philippe said it is unlikely that the way out of lockdown will be total and at the same time for everyone.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>China reportedly concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a US intelligence report, which noted China under reported coronavirus cases and deaths. The report noted concerns have also been raised in other nations, noting Western officials have looked at Iran, Russia, Indonesia and especially North Korea. Such assertions are unsurprising when viewed in the context of figures from Italy (population of 60mln) exceeding those of China (population of over 1bln). Elsewhere on the Iran front, US President Trump said upon information and belief Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on US troops and/or assets in Iraq, Iran would pay a very heavy price if this happens. A US official also said later that intelligence threads have been building for some time on a potential Iran-backed attack against the US in Iraq; noting an Iran-backed attack on US personnel in Iraq would likely be deniable, as opposed to state-on-state.</p><p><strong>UK: </strong>The NHS is, as according to The Telegraph, preparing to release an app that will alert users if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, a move that could define a pathway to the end of the lockdown. Meanwhile, UK Chancellor Sunak is to announce an overhaul of the Business Interruption Loans Scheme, in order to remove a key obstacle for SMEs that struggle to access it, Sky News reported.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US ISM FINAL MANUFACTURING PMI (MAR): </strong>The headline fared better than expected at 49.1 (exp. 45, prev. 50.1) However, ISM notes “The Supplier Deliveries Index registered 65 percent, up 7.7 percentage points from the February reading of 57.3 percent, and limited the decrease in the composite PMI”, where a reading above 50 shows slower deliveries typically as demand increases although the March reading was a product of coronavirus related supply problems, ISM writes. The report stated COVID-19 was the focus of 66% of the Supplier Deliveries Index comments, with a third of those comments related to supply chain constraints from China.&nbsp; The internals were grim, New orders at 42.2 from 49.8, employment slightly above expectations at 43.8 (exp. 43.6, prev. 46.9) and prices paid fell to 37.4, lower than expected. The report mentioned \"Inventories are expected to grow as disruptions in the supply chain lead to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advance stocking to protect production schedules”. Oxford Economics state the April report is likely to signal a more significant deterioration. It is worth noting the ISM stated there was no drop in the participation rate in March in terms of its survey panel responses.</p><p><strong>ADP </strong>reported 27k payrolls were lost from the US economy in March, better than the consensus view for -150k. However, while the data appear encouraging, the ADP itself noted that the survey period ran through the 12th of the month, meaning that much of the COVID impact has not been captured in the data. It is also worth noting that the official BLS employment situation report (released this coming Friday and is expected to show 100k jobs were lost in March) also runs through that period and may be subject to similar caveats. With that said, Thursday's weekly jobless claims data is probably a more important data print than either the March ADP or NFP; the Street looks for claims to rise to 3.5mln in the latest week, from the record 3.28mln last week.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.17 LOWER AT USD 20.31/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 1.61 LOWER AT USD 24.74/BBL.</strong></p><p><strong>Brent prices lead the losses in the energy complex on Wednesday</strong> amid continued OPEC supply concerns and ballooning inventories in the US. Saudi is continuing to follow through with its ramped supply, where an industry source reported that supply out of the Kingdom has surged above 12mln BPD (prev. 9.7mln BPD in March); WSJ sources later reported Saudi was boosting oil capacity to its maximum (earlier in the month Saudi was reported to be making efforts to boost its maximum capacity to 13mln BPD from 12mln) and is seeking a 15% discount from US contractors. Conversely, Russia is not planning to boost oil output amid oversupply, sources stated, adding that Russia is not holding talks with Saudi yet; echoed by the Kremlin, which stated talks could be set up in a timely manner if necessary. Following Russia-US conversations, US Energy Secretary Brouilette spoke with Russia Energy Minister Novak regarding global oil markets and they agreed to continue dialogue among major energy producers and consumers, as well as to keep discussing oil market volatility in G20. Meanwhile in the US, The Trump administration is planning to lease out space to energy companies to store oil in the SPR, according to sources, coming after the US funding bill thwarted efforts by the DoE to purchase oil for the SPR itself, which currently has capacity for an additional 77mln bbls. The extent of the supply glut is being felt by suppliers, US crude is reportedly being lifted by Chinese buyers in cargo loads at the widest discounts ever, where Chinese importers have been applying for tariff waivers as part of the Phase 1 US-China trade deal. WSJ sources later reported that President Trump would be meeting with oil executives to discuss potential aid for the industry, including the potential for implementing tariffs on imported oil from Saudi. Furthermore, BP has cut its 2020 spending plan by 25% and will cut output from its US shale oil and gas business. RBC’s energy analysts note the transition of US gasoline demand destruction now evolving into crude demand destruction, where much larger falls in refinery runs are required to structurally balance the domestic product market, where gasoline and jet fuel refiners continue to be punished; note the DoE report printed a 5% decline in refinery utilisation. Elsewhere in the DoE energy inventory data, the report confirmed Tuesday’s bearish private report, where crude stocks (bbls) spiked higher by 13.8mln and the 2.2mln distillate draw was offset by the 7.5mln gasoline build, while production remained at 13.0mln BPD.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 9+ TICKS HIGHER AT 138-31+.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX flattened amid a stock sell-off and issuance weighted towards the front. The T-Note caught its bid overnight and faded off its highs as Europeans left for the session. Desks noted that real money remained an aggressive seller into the Fed’s buy-back operations, where the T-Note rolled lower in the later part of the session alongside a high offer-to-cover ratio in the Fed’s 7- to 20-year maturity operation, perhaps a signal participants are happier to sell their UST holdings at these rates. It also may be ahead of Thursday, where the Fed will taper back its UST purchases from USD 75bln to 60bln a day, where there could be some front-running any perceived sell-off as the Fed begins to step back. Furthermore, corporates continue to swamp the issuance channels, including some European’s coming to the Dollar market on Wednesday – USD 6bln from AB InBev (10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) and USD 5bln from Equinor (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s). Elsewhere, note that the Fed’s RRP saw a fall in demand to USD 207.83bln across less counterparties, coinciding with slightly firmer GC rates, while the regular O/N repo operation in the morning saw zero bids, and a marginal amount in the afternoon. By settlement the curve was flatter, 2s unch. at 0.23%, 10s -6.5bps at 0.63%, 30s -6.5bps at 1.29%.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -4.31% at 2473, NDX -4.19% at 7486, DJIA -4.44% at 20944.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Utilities -6.12%, Real Estate -6.11%, Financials -5.97%, Technology -4.71%, Energy -4.64%, Materials -4.59%, Industrials -4.58%, Cons Disc -3.97%, Communication Svs -3.93%, Health -3.86%, Cons Stpl -1.83%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Xerox (XRX) announced it is to drop its hostile USD 35bln bid for HP Inc. (HPQ) due to the coronavirus pandemic, therefore it has withdrawn its tender offer and will no longer look to nominate its slate of candidates to HPQ’s board. Following the announcement, JP Morgan issued a note stating it is a mild positive for HPQ and it can now “prudently” resume its USD 5bln share repurchase program in May. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) completed its merger agreement. Apple Inc. (AAPL) supplier Foxconn (2317 TT) assured investors that the 5G iPhone can still launch this Autumn following some speculation there could be a delay. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) has filed for chapter 11. The Co noted it has over USD 585mln of cash on its balance sheet and it will continue operations in normal course. US President Trump is to meet with US oil company (CVX, XOM, OXY) CEO’s on Friday to discuss aid to the industry amid the current conditions. Note, earlier reports suggested President Trump's administration was planning to lease spaces for energy companies to store oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Deere (DE) announced it renewed its revolving credit lines in an aggregate amount of USD 8bln, Grainger (GWW) announced it has drawn down USD 1bln form its unsecured revolving credit facility. Raytheon (RTN) is to be replaced in the S&amp;P 500 after its merger with United Tech. (UTX) to form Raytheon Technologies (RTX) on the 3rd April open, where Otis Worldwide (OTIS), a spin-off Co of UTX, will replace RTN. While Macy’s (M) will be replaced by Carrier Global (CARR), also a spin-off of UTX. The spin offs were part of the merger agreement. Verizon (VZ) were upgraded to Conviction Buy from Buy at Goldman Sachs, while Comcast (CMCSA) were downgraded to Buy from Conviction Buy and AT&amp;T (T) were downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>DXY:</strong> The dollar caught a bid today and DXY crossed above 99 to highs of 99.79, which corresponds to a 38.2% fib level in March. Little reaction was seen in wake of the final Markit manufacturing and ISM surveys which saw weak interiors. ING noted prior to the data that a disappointing print could add to global pessimism although focus remains on the length and extension of the lockdowns and that the latest Fed repo facility to global central banks points to some USD weakness. Some had expected the greenback to ease as month end signalled for USD buying which was now expected to ease somewhat combined with the Fed’s Treasury operations. However, this was not the case to start the quarter and Scotia expect USD to remain better supported although upside is perhaps limited amid a potential deteriorating COVID-19 situation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Analysts at ING believe an ease of dollar funding fears and aggressive QE by the Fed in comparison to the ECB should put a floor under EURUSD in the next quarter but currently absent a factor for pushing above 1.10, although Eurobonds (joint fiscal issuance/policy) could perhaps be one although “markets are still lacking encouraging indications in this sense”. The EU commission announced it is mulling EUR 100bln for an EU funded short time work scheme, although this number is subject to change. Noting it would borrow on the market against guarantees from EU countries and not against the budget and that it would be available to all EU countries.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> hovered around the 1.24 handle after struggling to breach 1.2450 early on with Lloyd’s analysts look for Cable to develop a range between 1.2450 and support at 1.2245-1.2190. The desk notes if cable were to breach 1.25 to the upside, it would add conviction that the 1.15/14 levels seen recently were a “double bottom”, and could see a leg higher to 1.27 as next resistance, although on the flipside, if 1.1950 were to give way it could re test the 1.15/14 level.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> Scotia highlight that CAD1-month realized volatility is nearing the highest level in a decade at 18%, while soured risk appetite amid COVID-19 continues to weigh on the Loonie seeing it the G10 underperformer today. The Markit Manufacturing PMI data did little to sway price action but did little to help while participants await Friday’s employment data.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD:</strong> Analysts highlight that AUDUSD remains the biggest volatility risk in G10, hence some of the initial underperformance amid the soured risk appetite. However, AUD caught a bid heading into the 11:00 ET /16:00 GMT fix with some suggesting a technical breakout while a lack of liquidity in the current market conditions has also been cited, although the Aussie continued to weaken. Overnight, the RBA minutes saw little way of price action but noted the members strongly supported the proposed policy response but stressed the focus of the program was on bond yields rather than the quantity and timing of bond purchases. NZD tracked risk appetite and now remains around the 0.59 figure.</p><p><strong>CNY:</strong> Caixin's gauge of China manufacturing activity improved in March, rising to 50.1 (exp. 45.5) from the record low 40.3, and back into expansionary territory (just). The release noted that the manufacturing sector was under double pressure in March: business resumption was insufficient and worsening external demand and soft domestic consumer demand restricted production from expanding further. Additionally, some analysts note that the issue with the monthly survey data is that they require responses -- while businesses are on lockdown, it is unlikely that they all responded to the survey questions -- and as a result, the quality of the data is limited.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/XAU:</strong> The BOJ's Tankan survey fell to a seven-year low in Q1, though was better than feared. Japanese corporates cut their average USDJPY forecast for this fiscal year to 107.98 (prev. 108.67), also lowered EURJPY view to 120.29 (prev. 121.78). SocGen says the question is now whether the economic impact of the new coronavirus is only temporary until the immediate health crisis is over, or whether it will result in a prolonged economic downturn that will disrupt the scenario in which Japan escapes deflation; the Tankan seems to indicate that both the credit and capital investment cycles, and the Tankan cycles are still firm. \"In other words, the economic downturn caused by the new coronavirus can still be judged as only temporary,\" SG writes, adding that in order to maintain the firmness of both cycles in the future, it is necessary to maintain strong monetary easing and significantly expand fiscal policy. JPY however largely traded off risk today and was firmer against the buck despite a strong dollar as the risk averse appetite saw participants move the haven currency. CHF was not as attractive to JPY, although was firmer against a weaker Euro. XAU saw decent gains as the precious metal caught a bid on the risk appetite which saw the metal test 1600 to the upside, although pared somewhat to the 1580 region. As USD funding issues appear to have calmed (Fed’s O/N repo operation saw 0 bids), gold seems to be trading back on the risk environment rather than demand for dollars.</p><p><strong>KRW:</strong> Overnight, trade data showed a bounceback, which is a welcome sign that key trade partner China emerging from its lockdown, and supply chains are normalising, UBS said. With that said, it also signalled the effect of the demand shock from Europe and the US, with growth in exports weakening in the final part of March has lockdowns in those regions began taking hold.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> All generally weaker against the buck given the risk appetite with underperformance in MXN amid a fall in manufacturing PMI’s to 47.9 from 50, while Banxico placed a USD5bln credit auction and comments from Mexico President Obrador, who stated he does not favour the use of central bank reserves to stabilise the Peso. BRL hit a record low amid the poor risk appetite as it finds little reprieve from better than expected industrial output; Markit manufacturing PMI fell, however. It is worth noting overall, the IIF stated emerging market assets have suffered a sudden stop in capital flows due to the coronavirus, fall in oil prices and financial shocks.</p>",

It also may be ahead of Thursday, where the Fed will taper back its UST purchases from USD 75bln to 60bln a day, where there could be some front-running any perceived sell-off as the Fed begins to step back. Furthermore, corporates continue to swamp the issuance channels, including some European’s coming to the Dollar market on Wednesday – USD 6bln from AB InBev (10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) and USD 5bln from Equinor (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s). Elsewhere, note that the Fed’s RRP saw a fall in demand to USD 207.83bln across less counterparties, coinciding with slightly firmer GC rates, while the regular O/N repo operation in the morning saw zero bids, and a marginal amount in the afternoon.

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>Brent prices lead the losses in the energy complex on Wednesday</strong> amid continued OPEC supply concerns and ballooning inventories in the US. Saudi is continuing to follow through with its ramped supply, where an industry source reported that supply out of the Kingdom has surged above 12mln BPD (prev. 9.7mln BPD in March); WSJ sources later reported Saudi was boosting oil capacity to its maximum (earlier in the month Saudi was reported to be making efforts to boost its maximum capacity to 13mln BPD from 12mln) and is seeking a 15% discount from US contractors. Conversely, Russia is not planning to boost oil output amid oversupply, sources stated, adding that Russia is not holding talks with Saudi yet; echoed by the Kremlin, which stated talks could be set up in a timely manner if necessary. Following Russia-US conversations, US Energy Secretary Brouilette spoke with Russia Energy Minister Novak regarding global oil markets and they agreed to continue dialogue among major energy producers and consumers, as well as to keep discussing oil market volatility in G20. Meanwhile in the US, The Trump administration is planning to lease out space to energy companies to store oil in the SPR, according to sources, coming after the US funding bill thwarted efforts by the DoE to purchase oil for the SPR itself, which currently has capacity for an additional 77mln bbls. The extent of the supply glut is being felt by suppliers, US crude is reportedly being lifted by Chinese buyers in cargo loads at the widest discounts ever, where Chinese importers have been applying for tariff waivers as part of the Phase 1 US-China trade deal. WSJ sources later reported that President Trump would be meeting with oil executives to discuss potential aid for the industry, including the potential for implementing tariffs on imported oil from Saudi. Furthermore, BP has cut its 2020 spending plan by 25% and will cut output from its US shale oil and gas business. RBC’s energy analysts note the transition of US gasoline demand destruction now evolving into crude demand destruction, where much larger falls in refinery runs are required to structurally balance the domestic product market, where gasoline and jet fuel refiners continue to be punished; note the DoE report printed a 5% decline in refinery utilisation. Elsewhere in the DoE energy inventory data, the report confirmed Tuesday’s bearish private report, where crude stocks (bbls) spiked higher by 13.8mln and the 2.2mln distillate draw was offset by the 7.5mln gasoline build, while production remained at 13.0mln BPD.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Buck remains firm and on course for a solid start to April/Q2, but the index is off best levels and reversing earlier gains vs some major rivals in wake of the final Markit manufacturing PMI for March and ISM surveys. To recap, the former was revised down from the preliminary reading and sub-components fell to weakest levels since the GFC, while the latter defied expectations for a deeper sub-50 print in headline terms, but new orders, employment and prices paid all collapsed. For the record, ADP posted a considerably lower than forecast negative tally, though only due to the fact that data collated had a March 12 cut-off date and the full effect (or complete for the full month) of COVID-19 will not be reflected until April. Hence, limited market reaction as the DXY holds within 99.789-98.908 parameters.</p><p><strong>NOK/JPY/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Relative G10 outperformers or at least resilient to the Dollar’s broad recovery from overnight lows and latest retreat in oil prices. In fact, the Nok extended gains across the board and especially against the weak Eur in spite of crude’s flirt with Usd20/brl in WTI terms and Brent sliding to new a contract base sub-Usd25 on increasingly bullish technical vibes backed up by Norges Bank intervention via higher daily purchases vs foreign currencies on behalf of the Norwegian Government. Meanwhile, safe-haven demand helped the Yen rebound from almost 108.00 to just a few pips from 107.00 after breaching this week’s prior peak, but not quite reaching 1 bn option expiries at the round number. Elsewhere, Sterling also appeared to benefit from favourable chart impulses and the Euro’s inability to maintain gains above 1.1000 vs the Greenback, as Eur/Gbp reversed from 0.8900+ through 0.8800 and Cable reclaimed 1.2400+ status.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF/NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All off worst levels, but still under pressure as the Loonie returns to circa 1.4200 after a dire Canadian manufacturing PMI and a short squeeze that was unsustainable, while the single currency remains rooted near 1.0900 and Franc is nudging 0.9700 again. However, the Kiwi and Aussie have both embarked on rather impressive and ongoing rebounds that seem technical in nature instead of fundamental following tests of downside levels and then a recapture of others, with the former back over 0.5900 and latter hovering around 0.6100 vs 0.5881 and 0.6040 at one stage.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Widespread depreciation on the first day of the new month and quarter, but particularly for the Lira amidst growing investor concerns about Turkey’s ability to fight the economic fallout from nCoV, while the Forint fell to new record lows after a sub-30.0 Hungarian manufacturing PMI.</p>",

        "subject": "US Equities open in negative territory to start Q2 with all sectors in negative territory; SPX -3%",
        "content": "<p><strong>OPEN: </strong>US stocks open in the red, with all sectors in negative territory as Real Estate, Financials and Industrials underperform and Consumer Staples see relative outperformance, although open -2%. Overnight, Asian bourses were mixed, with the Nikkei and Hang Seng slumping, but the CSI was firmer. The equity landscape in Europe is currently a sea of red with financials lagging after UK banks suspended dividend payments; energy sits at the top of the pack.</p><p><strong>SECTORS/THEMES:</strong> Energy names are under pressure again as crude prices get hammered due to oversupply fears as the OPEC+ supply curb deal officially expires. In the US, reports stated US President Trump’s administration is planning to lease spaces for energy companies to store oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after it rebuffed its plan to purchase oil to fill the SPR “to the top” amid a lack of funding, according to people familiar with the matter. Although, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin noted the administration did ask for approval to fill up the SPR and it will continue to ask congress. Housing names will be in focus after weekly MBA mortgage data showed mortgage applications rising 15.3% after last week’s -29.4%, while Macau gaming revenue for March declined 79.7% to MOP (patacas) 5.275bln.</p><p><strong>US STOCK STORIES: </strong>Xerox (XRX) announced it is to drop its hostile USD 35bln bid for HP Inc. (HPQ) due to the coronavirus pandemic, therefore it has withdrawn its tender offer and will no longer look to nominate its slate of candidates to HPQ’s board. Following the announcement, JP Morgan issued a note stating it is a mild positive for HPQ and it can now “prudently” resume its USD5bln share repurchase programme in May. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) completed its merger agreement. Apple Inc. (AAPL) supplier Foxconn (2317 TT) assured investors that the 5G iPhone can still launch this Autumn following some speculation there could be a delay. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) (Energy/Oil, Gas &amp; Consumable Fuels) had been halted pre-market as it announced it had filed for its chapter 11. The co. noted it has over USD 585mln of cash on its balance sheet and it will continue operations in normal course. Verizon (VZ) were upgraded to Conviction Buy from Buy at Goldman Sachs, while Comcast (CMCSA) were downgraded to Buy from Conviction Buy and AT&amp;T (T) were downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JP Morgan.</p><p><strong>MACRO:</strong> The mood is risk-off amid fears about the impact of COVID-19 after warnings from US President Trump that Americans face a tough fortnight ahead, where the death toll in the US could hit 240k. Fed’s Mester on Tuesday warned that the unemployment rate could hit 10%. The ADP’s gauge of payrolls in March showed -27k, the first negative print since 2017, although it was firmer than the expected -150k print. However, the data was used through March 12th, therefore not reflecting the complete COVID-19 impact. It is also worth noting that the official BLS employment situation report (released this coming Friday and is expected to show 100k jobs were lost in March) also runs through that period, and may be subject to similar caveats. Traders will be keeping particular focus on Thursday’s initial jobless claims data, which will be a more significant release than the monthly employment situation report on Friday; currently, the consensus expects weekly claims at 3.5mln against last week’s 3.28mln.</p><p><strong>PMI DATA: </strong>In Europe, PMI data has highlighted the challenges of the virus; China PMIs saw some improvement, although there are questions about the quality of the signal; the US manufacturing ISM at 10am ET is eyed, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-march-manufacturing-ism-due-at-1500-bst-1000-et-analysts-expect-a-5-point-drop-01-04-2020\">click here for primer.</a></p><p><strong>FED OPERATIONS: </strong>With liquidity conditions a major driver of price action, desks continue to note the macro impact of the Fed’s Treasury purchases; some have suggested that the playbook seems to be selling Treasuries lightly into the operations, and then covering back on the dip, with equity traders on the lookout for any cross-asset moves during the times of operations. (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-tips-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-1st-april-2020-01-04-2020\">see here</a> for today’s full schedule)</p><p><strong>SHORT-TERM TRADERS: </strong>Nomura's quants are concerned that ultra-short-term traders have yet to start buying US equities, noting that historically, short term traders have tended to take contrarian long positions when US stocks have troughed, just ahead of a full-fledged bear-squeeze rally. The recent performance of these ultra-short-term traders suggests that they have plenty of scope to take on more risk, Nomura says, and the fact that they are holding back can be read as a sign that even investors with very short horizons have their doubts about whether the present rally in equities has legs.</p><p><strong>MEDIUM-TERM TRADERS:</strong> Nomura also notes that global macro hedge funds, who have historically tended to pick up on changes in the medium-term trajectory of the economy before other classes of investors, are still neutral/short to DM equities, which Nomura says shows that they too are not picturing an optimistic scenario from a top-down perspective.</p>",

For historical context, if the expectation becomes reality, it would be the lowest headline since the 44.1 in May 2009; during the financial crisis, the lowest print for the manufacturing ISM headline was 34.5 in December 2008. The record low for the series is 29.4 in May 1980.</li><li>Regional surveys indicate some downside to the consensus view, Morgan Stanley said. Based on the Kansas City, Richmond, Empire and Philly Fed surveys, MS tracker is signalling the headline at 43.3.</li><li>Looking around the globe, manufacturing surveys have held up better than their more-labour intensive services counterpart in China and Europe, where equivalent measures of the ISM have been released, SocGen's analysts note. But for manufacturing specifically, auto factories largely closed for the final two weeks of March, but were already running at a subdued pace earlier in the month.</li><li>Additionally, attention will be on some of the forward-looking metrics, like new orders; previously the component stood at 49.8 falling from 52.0; we have been lower recently; in November, new orders was 46.8 amid US/China trade tensions.</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mixed with sentiment cautious after Wall St wrapped up the worst quarterly performance in the S&amp;P 500 since 2008</strong> and biggest quarterly loss on record for the DJIA, as risk appetite remained centred on the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in which the US, UK and Spain all experienced their highest daily death tolls to date. <strong>ASX 200 (+3.6%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-4.5%)</strong> were mixed with outperformance in Australia led by the energy sector after oil prices found mild reprieve overnight and as financials also benefitted from recent regulatory concessions, while the Japanese benchmark faltered on the weight of the detrimental currency flows and after negative Tankan numbers which showed the lowest reading in the Large Manufacturing Index in 7 years. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%)</strong> diverged with the mainland underpinned by the surprise expansion in Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI and recent comments by China’s State Council which pledged further support measures including targeted RRR cuts. However, the mood in Hong Kong was less productive after a record slump in Retail Sales and with hefty losses seen in HSBC and Standard Chartered after they scrapped dividend and share repurchase plans on the directive of UK authorities to provide an extra cushion amid the coronavirus fallout. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly higher amid the negative risk appetite in Japan and after the BoJ recently raised the frequency of its purchase intentions for this month, although upside was capped by resistance ahead of 153.00 and due to a reserved Rinban operation in which the BoJ reduced its purchase amount for 3yr-5yr bonds.&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump is to suspend certain tariffs payments for 90-days on imports such as apparel and light trucks,</strong> although it will not include some of the high-profile tariffs including the metals tariffs and punitive tariffs on USD 360bln of imports from China. (FT)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>The fading of month/quarter-end factors and the quietened stimulus news-flow have prompted global equitys to resume the sell-off, with Europe (Eurostoxx 50 -3.2%) following</strong> the negative lead from Wall Street and Asia overnight. Core markets see slightly more pronounced losses than peripheries, with particular underperformance seen in the UK’s FTSE 100 (-3.7%). The index is pressured by a slew of banks posting losses between 5-10% after agreeing to scrap a total of ~GBP 7.5bln in dividends and suspending share buybacks upon the order of the UK government. The BoE also stated that they are prepared to look into using their supervisory powers in the event the commitments are not adhered to; thus, HSBC (-8.5 %), Standard Chartered (-7.0%), Lloyds (-5.5%), Barclays (-6.1%) and RBS (-6.4%) are all on the backfoot. Unsurprisingly, the Financials sector is the laggard with Banks the underperformers in the sector breakdown. Energy follows a close second amid the rotting prices in the complex after yesterday’s mild reprieve. Travel &amp; Leisure holds its place as one of the heavier-hit sectors due to the ongoing demand decline. In terms of individual movers Pirelli (-2.2%) failed to hold onto gains spurred by Italian brake maker Brembo purchasing a 2.43% stake in the company, as upside was potentially shaved by Continental’s (-5.0%) guidance withdrawal and bleak assessment of the auto and tire divisions – with material changes and disruptions seen in significant portions of its business – Nokian (-12.3%) and Michelin (-0.5%) also reside in the red, although the latter is somewhat cushioned by a broker upgrade at Barclays. Finally, Adidas (-2.9%) declines after suspending its EUR 1bln share buyback to conserve cash in light of retail store closures in Europe and North America.</p><p>China is reportedly considering easing the production quota on electric vehicles this year, delaying the implementation of emission rules by 6-months, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar has regained momentum after Tuesday’s late tumble amidst dwindling demand for portfolio rebalancing and a 7th liquidity providing repo facility from the Fed, with widespread rebounds against G10 counterparts pushing the DXY up from sub-99.000 lows through 99.500 again. However, risk sentiment remains fragile to say the least and prone to further abrupt swings, while looming US economic indicators are destined to reveal more COVID-19 contagion that could scupper the latest Greenback revival. On that note, ADP will be viewed with added interest along with jobs components from the manufacturing PMI and ISM as proxies for the monthly BLS report on Friday and ahead of tomorrow’s weekly claims that many believe may top last Thursday’s 3.3 mn or so record breaking number.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD - </strong>In keeping with yesterday’s price action, the Aussie and Kiwi only received temporary overnight traction from another Chinese PMI beat and headline print back above the key 50.0 level (albeit just in the case of Caixin’s manufacturing index) before recoiling from around 0.6160 and just under 0.6000 respectively vs their US peer to almost 0.6050 and sub-0.5900 before paring some losses (latter circa chart support). Meanwhile, the Loonie also has declining crude prices to contend with and has fallen below 1.4200 ahead of Canada’s manufacturing PMI that could feasibly lose 50.0 status.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/EUR - </strong>Also succumbing to the Buck’s bounce and renewed risk aversion, as Cable retreats from 1.2400, the Franc from near 0.9600 and Euro recoils from 1.1000+ towards 1.0900, with little or no reaction to UK, Swiss or Eurozone manufacturing PMIs irrespective of outcomes vs expectations.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK - </strong>In contrast to other majors, the Yen retains an element of safe-haven premium between 107.94-26 parameters and is well within striking distance of decent option expiries spaced equidistantly from 108.00 to 107.00 (2 bn at the top, 1.4 bn at 107.50 and 1 bn at the bottom). Meanwhile, the Norwegian Krona and its Swedish peer to a lesser extent have largely shrugged off sharp declines in manufacturing PMIs into contraction territory, and the former also the aforementioned downturn in oil, as Eur/Nok continues to trade off increased Norges Bank currency action below 11.4000 and Eur/Sek is capped ahead of 11.0000.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>No such luck for the Hungarian Forint after a horrendous plunge in the manufacturing PMI to 29.1 from 50.3 and added dire news in the breakdown as new orders sunk. Hence, Eur/Huf has advanced to fresh all time peaks approaching 364.00.</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes from</strong> <strong>March Emergency Meeting</strong> stated that members strongly supported proposed policy response as a comprehensive package and noted that focus of the program was on bond yields rather than quantity or timing of bond purchases. RBA also noted that it is important to emphasise that the bank expected a recovery once the coronavirus outbreak is contained although the timing is uncertain, while it stated there were <strong>likely to be significant job losses over the months ahead</strong>.

However, the Gbp 3bn 2028 offering was devoured in comparison to barely covered German&nbsp;Bobls&nbsp;that would have been a technical failure without retention, though nothing out of the ordinary. In response, new intraday highs for&nbsp;Gilts&nbsp;on Liffe and closer to Monday’s 137.33 best, at 137.19, while&nbsp;<strong>Bunds</strong>&nbsp;are keeping their head above 173.00 vs 173.48 at one stage and the <strong>10 year&nbsp;T-note</strong>&nbsp;is poised a few ticks off its 139-13+ overnight session apex. Ahead, a busy US agenda in keeping with the first trading day of the month, and with several items that should register, like ADP, Markit’s PMI and the ISM.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI&nbsp;and&nbsp;Brent&nbsp;front-month</strong> futures resume the decline following the prior session’s mild reprieve – whilst divergence is seen between the energy benchmarks. Brent underperforms as it sees renewed pressure from further OPEC roadblocks after members failed to agree on an emergency meeting to deal with the price rot. OPEC’s President has been pushing for a meeting of OPEC’s Economic Commission Board – an OPEC body that does not set policy but makes recommendations. Sources noted that Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, and Nigeria pushed for no such meeting. The meeting itself could be agreed to by a simple majority of the 13 members, although the absence of Saudi would mean the meeting has no power to come to a consensus even if agreed upon as the Kingdom accounts for around 33% of total OPEC output. As a reminder, prior sources noted that Saudi opted for the next meeting to take place on the scheduled June date. Furthermore, as the OPEC+ production pact expired last night, the Kingdom is readying to ramp up its supply levels above 12mln BPD from ~10mln BPD in March, a move confirmed by an industry official.&nbsp;Russia is reportedly ditching its plans to raise production&nbsp;by 300k BPD (with scope for it to be raised to 500k BPD) amid the supply glut, albeit the rift with Saudi remains.&nbsp;Brent&nbsp;futures briefly dipped below USD 25/bbl, having slipped from yesterday’s USD 27.90/bbl high. Meanwhile,&nbsp;WTI&nbsp;fares modestly better amid a seemingly growing alliance between US and Russia after sources suggested a US-Saudi partnership has been put on hold, possibly after Saudi refused US’ request to ditch production hikes. The US and Russian Energy Ministers, after President Trump and President Putin’s call, agreed to continue the dialogue among major producers and keep tabs on the market volatility. Furthermore, sources State-side said the Trump Admin is mulling leasing SPR storage to energy companies. The plan could be announced as soon as today and comes after the Admin failed to secure funding from Congress to purchase cheap oil to fill the SPR’s 77mln barrels of free capacity. The idea of the revised plan is to tackle the risk of overwhelming commercial storage from the growing supply glut, oil will be stored for sale later once the crisis subsides. Elsewhere, the weekly Private Inventory data only adds to the bearish fire after a larger-than-expected build of 10.5mln barrels vs. Exp. 4mln barrels – traders will be eyeing today’s DoEs for confirmation. In terms of metals,&nbsp;<strong>spot&nbsp;gold</strong>&nbsp;recoups some of the prior day’s losses after the downside was exacerbated heading into the US cash close. The yellow metal dipped below USD 1600/oz and its 21 DMA at USD 1589/oz. Prices currently hover in-between those levels.&nbsp;<strong>Copper</strong>&nbsp;prices largely move in tandem with the overall risk appetite, albeit to a lesser extent. The red metal remains north of USD 2/lb but off best levels.</p><p><strong>Russia is not planning to boost oil output amid oversupply, sources state, Russia is not holding talks with Saudi </strong>yet; echoed by the Kremlin stating that they are not holding talks with Saudi Arabia on the oil market at present; but talks could be set up in a timely manner if necessary (Newswires) Separately, Russian Energy Minister Novak discussed the current oil market with US Energy Secretary on Tuesday, as well as mutual co-operation, according to the Energy Ministry; adding the slump in demand and oversupply in market creates long-term risks.

Core markets see slightly more pronounced losses than peripheries, with particular underperformance seen in the UK’s FTSE 100 (-3.7%). The index is pressured by a slew of banks posting losses between 5-10% after agreeing to scrap a total of ~GBP 7.5bln in dividends and suspending share buybacks upon the order of the UK government. The BoE also stated that they are prepared to look into using their supervisory powers in the event the commitments are not adhered to; thus, HSBC (-8.5 %), Standard Chartered (-7.0%), Lloyds (-5.5%), Barclays (-6.1%) and RBS (-6.4%) are all on the backfoot. Unsurprisingly, the Financials sector is the laggard with Banks the underperformers in the sector breakdown. Energy follows a close second amid the rotting prices in the complex after yesterday’s mild reprieve. Travel &amp; Leisure holds its place as one of the heavier-hit sectors due to the ongoing demand decline. In terms of individual movers Pirelli (-2.2%) failed to hold onto gains spurred by Italian brake maker Brembo purchasing a 2.43% stake in the company, as upside was potentially shaved by Continental’s (-5.0%) guidance withdrawal and bleak assessment of the auto and tire divisions – with material changes and disruptions seen in significant portions of its business – Nokian (-12.3%) and Michelin (-0.5%) also reside in the red, although the latter is somewhat cushioned by a broker upgrade at Barclays. Finally, Adidas (-2.9%) declines after suspending its EUR 1bln share buyback to conserve cash in light of retail store closures in Europe and North America.</p><p><strong>FX</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar has regained momentum after Tuesday’s late tumble amidst dwindling demand for portfolio rebalancing and a 7th liquidity providing repo facility from the Fed, with widespread rebounds against G10 counterparts pushing the DXY up from sub-99.000 lows through 99.500 again. However, risk sentiment remains fragile to say the least and prone to further abrupt swings, while looming US economic indicators are destined to reveal more COVID-19 contagion that could scupper the latest Greenback revival. On that note, ADP will be viewed with added interest along with jobs components from the manufacturing PMI and ISM as proxies for the monthly BLS report on Friday and ahead of tomorrow’s weekly claims that many believe may top last Thursday’s 3.3 mn or so record breaking number.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong> - In keeping with yesterday’s price action, the Aussie and Kiwi only received temporary overnight traction from another Chinese PMI beat and headline print back above the key 50.0 level (albeit just in the case of Caixin’s manufacturing index) before recoiling from around 0.6160 and just under 0.6000 respectively vs their US peer to almost 0.6050 and sub-0.5900 before paring some losses (latter circa chart support). Meanwhile, the Loonie also has declining crude prices to contend with and has fallen below 1.4200 ahead of Canada’s manufacturing PMI that could feasibly lose 50.0 status.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/EUR</strong> - Also succumbing to the Buck’s bounce and renewed risk aversion, as Cable retreats from 1.2400, the Franc from near 0.9600 and Euro recoils from 1.1000+ towards 1.0900, with little or no reaction to UK, Swiss or Eurozone manufacturing PMIs irrespective of outcomes vs expectations.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK</strong> - In contrast to other majors, the Yen retains an element of safe-haven premium between 107.94-26 parameters and is well within striking distance of decent option expiries spaced equidistantly from 108.00 to 107.00 (2 bn at the top, 1.4 bn at 107.50 and 1 bn at the bottom). Meanwhile, the Norwegian Krona and its Swedish peer to a lesser extent have largely shrugged off sharp declines in manufacturing PMIs into contraction territory, and the former also the aforementioned downturn in oil, as Eur/Nok continues to trade off increased Norges Bank currency action below 11.4000 and Eur/Sek is capped ahead of 11.0000.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - No such luck for the Hungarian Forint after a horrendous plunge in the manufacturing PMI to 29.1 from 50.3 and added dire news in the breakdown as new orders sunk. Hence, Eur/Huf has advanced to fresh all time peaks approaching 364.00.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>The marked change of fortunes for UK bonds continues in wake of the first leg of this month’s hefty refunding that augurs well for the remaining auctions, albeit it’s very early days to be certain. However, the Gbp 3bn 2028 offering was devoured in comparison to barely covered German <strong>Bobls</strong> that would have been a technical failure without retention, though nothing out of the ordinary. In response, new intraday highs for <strong>Gilts</strong> on Liffe and closer to Monday’s 137.33 best, at 137.19, while <strong>Bunds</strong> are keeping their head above 173.00 vs 173.48 at one stage and the 10 year <strong>T-note</strong> is poised a few ticks off its 139-13+ overnight session apex. Ahead, a busy US agenda in keeping with the first trading day of the month, and with several items that should register, like ADP, Markit’s PMI and the ISM.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures resume the decline following the prior session’s mild reprieve – whilst divergence is seen between the energy benchmarks. Brent underperforms as it sees renewed pressure from further OPEC roadblocks after members failed to agree on an emergency meeting to deal with the price rot. OPEC’s President has been pushing for a meeting of OPEC’s Economic Commission Board – an OPEC body that does not set policy but makes recommendations. Sources noted that Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, and Nigeria pushed for no such meeting. The meeting itself could be agreed to by a simple majority of the 13 members, although the absence of Saudi would mean the meeting has no power to come to a consensus even if agreed upon as the Kingdom accounts for around 33% of total OPEC output. As a reminder, prior sources noted that Saudi opted for the next meeting to take place on the scheduled June date. Furthermore, as the OPEC+ production pact expired last night, the Kingdom is readying to ramp up its supply levels above 12mln BPD from ~10mln BPD in March, a move confirmed by an industry official. <strong>Russia is reportedly ditching its plans to raise production</strong> by 300k BPD (with scope for it to be raised to 500k BPD) amid the supply glut, albeit the rift with Saudi remains. <strong>Brent</strong> futures briefly dipped below USD 25/bbl, having slipped from yesterday’s USD 27.90/bbl high. Meanwhile, <strong>WTI</strong> fares modestly better amid a seemingly growing alliance between US and Russia after sources suggested a US-Saudi partnership has been put on hold, possibly after Saudi refused US’ request to ditch production hikes. The US and Russian Energy Ministers, after President Trump and President Putin’s call, agreed to continue the dialogue among major producers and keep tabs on the market volatility. Furthermore, sources State-side said the Trump Admin is mulling leasing SPR storage to energy companies. The plan could be announced as soon as today and comes after the Admin failed to secure funding from Congress to purchase cheap oil to fill the SPR’s 77mln barrels of free capacity. The idea of the revised plan is to tackle the risk of overwhelming commercial storage from the growing supply glut, oil will be stored for sale later once the crisis subsides. Elsewhere, the weekly Private Inventory data only adds to the bearish fire after a larger-than-expected build of 10.5mln barrels vs. Exp. 4mln barrels – traders will be eyeing today’s DoEs for confirmation. In terms of metals, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> recoups some of the prior day’s losses after the downside was exacerbated heading into the US cash close. The yellow metal dipped below USD 1600/oz and its 21 DMA at USD 1589/oz. Prices currently hover in-between those levels. <strong>Copper</strong> prices largely move in tandem with the overall risk appetite, albeit to a lesser extent. The red metal remains north of USD 2/lb but off best levels.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> diverged with the mainland underpinned by the surprise expansion in Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI and recent comments by China’s State Council which pledged further support measures including targeted RRR cuts. However, the mood in Hong Kong was less productive after a record slump in Retail Sales and with hefty losses seen in HSBC and Standard Chartered after they scrapped dividend and share repurchase plans on the directive of UK authorities to provide an extra cushion amid the coronavirus fallout. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly higher amid the negative risk appetite in Japan and after the BoJ recently raised the frequency of its purchase intentions for this month, although upside was capped by resistance ahead of 153.00 and due to a reserved Rinban operation in which the BoJ reduced its purchase amount for 3yr-5yr bonds.&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>In FX markets, the prior day’s retreat in the DXY was stemmed after finding support around the 99.00 level</strong>, which resulted to a mild pullback in its peers across the pond with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly homing in on the 1.1000 level where there is a large EUR 1.9bln option expiry for today’s New York cut and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> slipping below 1.2400, as well as its nearby 20-Hour and 50-Hour MA levels. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> attempted to nurse some of the recent losses but remained sub-108.00 and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were lacklustre amid the subdued risk-appetite in Japan, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> consolidated near the prior day’s lows with better than expected Chinese PMI data and Australian Building Approvals doing little to spur price action. Furthermore, the RBA minutes from the March emergency meeting provided very little in the way of fresh insight but suggested the likelihood of significant job losses ahead, while New Zealand officials were also downbeat with the Treasury anticipating at least a 10% contraction in Q2 GDP.</p><p>RBA Minutes from March Emergency Meeting stated that members strongly supported proposed policy response as a comprehensive package and noted that focus of the program was on bond yields rather than quantity or timing of bond purchases. RBA also noted that it is important to emphasise that the bank expected a recovery once the coronavirus outbreak is contained although the timing is uncertain, while it stated there were likely to be significant job losses over the months ahead.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures traded flat to outperform the losses in Brent crude after comments from US President Trump who suggested Saudi and Russia are in discussions, while the US also reportedly plans to lease SPR storage space to address the supply glut which risks collapsing prices even further. However, upside in WTI was minimal with prices contained around the USD 20.50/bbl level after the larger than expected build in headline private crude inventories and after Saudi recently instructed oil service companies to be prepared to support increasing domestic oil output to 12mln BPD from today. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices saw mild reprieve overnight from the prior day’s slump below USD 1600/oz, while <strong>copper</strong> was pressured amid the indecisive overnight risk tone.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 27th Mar) +10.5mln vs. Exp. +4.0mln (Prev. -1.2mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>OPEC members failed to unanimously agree on an emergency meeting of its economic commission board according to source reports,</strong> while sources also noted the US and Saudi oil alliance has for now been put aside.

(Newswires/Twitter)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX was little changed on Tuesday, excluding the long end, which was weaker by settlement. The Fed remains the main buyer in town across the curve, and similar to Monday, its completion of purchases in the belly earlier on in the session saw yields rise off their lows heading into settlement, although by no means drastically, as desks note a supply drought as gauged by lower take-up in the Fed’s Treasury purchases on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Fed’s RRP operation continued to balloon while the regular repo ops saw miniscule take-up. The IG slate continues to let it rip, albeit less pronounced than Monday (IFR noted March as the largest volume month ever with USD 256.47bln in supply), while Israel came to the SSA market (10s, 30s, 100s). By settlement, yields were relatively unchanged, if not higher at the long end, 2s +1bps at 0.238%, 10s +3bps at 0.702%, 30s +7.5bps at 1.359%. T-note (M0) futures settled 4+ ticks lower at 138-22.</p><p><strong>Fed's Mester (voter, hawk)</strong> said an unemployment rate above 10% is feasible because economic activity is being shut down to stop the spread of the virus, while she expects some very bad numbers for the economy but added that the situation can improve when we get to the other side. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Daly (non-voter, dovish)</strong> said she expects the economy to get worse before it gets better and already believes US is in a recession, while she added that what the Fed does depends on the evolution of the virus and that it is prepared to do whatever is required within its powers. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump is to suspend certain tariffs payments for 90-days on imports such as apparel and light trucks,</strong> although it will not include some of the high-profile tariffs including the metals tariffs and punitive tariffs on USD 360bln of imports from China.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with sentiment cautious following the headwinds from Wall St where stocks finished negative and wrapped up the worst quarterly performance in the S&amp;P 500 since 2008 and biggest quarterly loss in the DJIA on record, as risk appetite remains centred on the ongoing coronavirus pandemic with US, UK and Spain all experiencing their highest daily death tolls to date. ASX 200 (+3.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) are mixed with outperformance in Australia led by the energy sector after oil prices found mild reprieve overnight and as financials also benefit from recent regulatory concessions, while the Japanese benchmark falters on the weight of the detrimental currency flows and after negative Tankan numbers which showed the lowest reading in the Large Manufacturing Index in 7 years. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) are indecisive as the mainland benefits from better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI which showed a surprise expansion, as well as recent comments by China’s State Council which pledged further support measures including targeted RRR cuts. However, the mood in Hong Kong is less productive after a record slump in Retail Sales and with hefty losses seen in HSBC and Standard Chartered after they scrapped dividend and share repurchase plans on the directive of UK authorities to provide an extra cushion amid the coronavirus fallout.</p><p>In FX markets, the prior day’s retreat in the DXY was stemmed after finding support around the 99.00 level, which has resulted to a mild pullback in its peers across the pond with EUR/USD homing in on the 1.1000 level where there is a large EUR 1.9bln option expiry for today’s New York cut and with GBP/USD slipping below 1.2400, as well as nearby 20-Hour and 50-Hour MA levels. Elsewhere, USD/JPY attempts to nurse some of the recent losses but remains sub-108.00 and JPY-crosses are lacklustre amid the subdued risk-appetite in Japan, while antipodeans are lacklustre as both AUD/USD and NZD/USD consolidate near the prior day’s lows with better than expected Chinese PMI data, Australian Building Approvals and RBA minutes from the March emergency meeting doing little to spur price action as the latter provided very little in the way of fresh insight but suggested the likelihood of significant job losses ahead.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher amid the negative risk appetite in Japan following a negative Tankan survey and after the BoJ also recently raised the frequency of its purchase intentions for this month, although prices are capped by resistance ahead of 153.00 and following a reserved Rinban announcement in which the BoJ reduced its purchase amount for 3yr-5yr bonds.&nbsp;</p>",
