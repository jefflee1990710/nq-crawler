(RIA)</p><p>India Minister said they are exploring the possibility in the US to store low-priced crude oil and have urged the finance ministry to cut some oil producer taxes. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>US markets were shut, although European bourses kicked the week off on the front-foot in holiday-thinned trade, after taking a positive lead from Asia. In the absence of UK and US participants, European indices initially eked out mild gains but sentiment picked up in recent trade (Eurostoxx 50 +1.1%) in spite of lingering tensions between US and China and ongoing concerns about an impending clash regarding the EU recovery fund with sentiment instead potentially lifted by a pick-up in reopening efforts across the continent. Sectors are higher across the board with outperformance seen in IT and industrial names, with performance for the latter bolstered by German heavyweight Bayer (+6.9%) after the Co. reportedly reached a verbal agreement regarding 50-85k of the 125k US Roundup lawsuits. Elsewhere, individual movers include Lagardere (+11.8%) with Co. shares boosted after French billionaire Arnault agreed to buy a stake in the Co., whilst Deutsche Lufthansa (+2.0%) shares have been supported amid ongoing hopes that the Co. can strike a deal with the German government and reports that the airline will resume more flights as of mid-June; something which has also provided a tailwind in the travel-space for Tui (+11.3%). Elsewhere, gains of over 2% for Renault were faded early doors (currently +1.1%) with the Co. and Nissan set to announce billions of USD in cost cutting measures this week, according to sources. Note, competitor Peugeot (+2.8%) has managed to maintain strength in early European trade as markets await details of support measures for the French auto sector that are due to be announced tomorrow.</p>",

In the absence of UK and US participants, European indices initially eked out mild gains but sentiment picked up in recent trade (Eurostoxx 50 +1.1%) in spite of lingering tensions between US and China and ongoing concerns about an impending clash regarding the EU recovery fund with sentiment instead potentially lifted by a pick-up in reopening efforts across the continent. Sectors are higher across the board with outperformance seen in IT and industrial names, with performance for the latter bolstered by German heavyweight Bayer (+6.9%) after the Co. reportedly reached a verbal agreement regarding 50-85k of the 125k US Roundup lawsuits. Elsewhere, individual movers include Lagardere (+11.8%) with Co. shares boosted after French billionaire Arnault agreed to buy a stake in the Co., whilst Deutsche Lufthansa (+2.0%) shares have been supported amid ongoing hopes that the Co. can strike a deal with the German government and reports that the airline will resume more flights as of mid-June; something which has also provided a tailwind in the travel-space for Tui (+11.3%). Elsewhere, gains of over 2% for Renault were faded early doors (currently +1.1%) with the Co. and Nissan set to announce billions of USD in cost cutting measures this week, according to sources. Note, competitor Peugeot (+2.8%) has managed to maintain strength in early European trade as markets await details of support measures for the French auto sector that are due to be announced tomorrow.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>EUR, CHF - The G10 underperformers thus far in holiday-thinned volumes as the Single Currency eyes a roadblock regarding the EU Recovery Fund – with the “frugal four” (Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, and Sweden) countering the Franco-German proposal of grant distributions. The perceived hawks call for loan allocations – a drawback for peripheries Italy, Spain, and Greece (among others) – with the former also facing a potential rise in domestic anti-Euro sentiment. EUR/USD breached Friday’s 1.0885 low which coincide with the 10DMA to a current low of 1.0871, having briefly dipped below its 21DMA at 1.0873. Further levels to the downside include a Fib at 1.0864 (61.8% of the 1.0775-1.1008 move) ahead of the psychological 1.0850. Unrevised German GDP finals and an overall mixed Ifo survey did little to shift the narrative. Option expiries see EUR 550mln at 1.0875-85, 800mln at 1.0895-1.0900, and EUR 1bln rolling off between 1.0910-20. The Franc meanwhile sees safe-haven outflows, albeit to a greater extent vs. its Japanese counterpart as EUR/CHF revisits support around the 1.0575 area.</p><p>DXY, CNY, HKD - The broader Dollar and Index initially extends on overnight gains before pulling back, with support also derived from the heavy EUR basket contribution. DXY inched higher towards 100.000 (vs. low 99.716) to the upside with its 50DMA residing nearby at 100.02. Elsewhere, the Yuan remains on the backfoot amid heightened US-Sino tensions, coupled with international backlash for Mainland’s crackdown on anti-govt Hong Kong behaviour. Further, the PBOC set the weakest CNY fixing since 2008 (7.1209 vs. Prev. 7.0939) following Friday’s losses. HKD meanwhile unsurprisingly experienced weakness but USD/HKD sees itself just above the bottom end of the 7.75-7.85 peg.</p><p>GBP, CAD - The marginally better performers ex-USD, but action remains minimal in thin conditions. Cable overnight remained restricted under 1.2200 as PM Johnson was said to face Cabinet revolt after supporting senior adviser Cummings who faced calls to resign after breaching the lockdown – potentially leading to Cabinet dissent and citizens disobeying lockdown rules. Brexit developments have also remained in focus amid the diminishing timeframe to hammer out an FTA by year-end. Weekend developments noted that the UK is in a fresh stand-off with the EU regarding delays in granting diplomatic status to the EU’s representation in London. Furthermore, relations with China should be watched over the Hong Kong developments – with PM Johnson reportedly looking to reduce Huawei’s involvement in UK 5G network within the next three years. Cable resides towards the bottom of the current 1.2162-91 intraday band, ahead of a 61.8% Fib of last week’s bounce coinciding with Friday’s low ~1.2160. The Loonie meanwhile tracks price action in the US energy benchmarks. USD/CAD resides just south of 1.4000, having earlier tested resistance at its 21DMA at 1.4007 (intraday high).</p><p>AUD, NZD - Antipodeans tracked the weakness in the Yuan as tensions with China remain elevated and with the US-Sino spat also providing less basis to join in on global lockdown easing optimism/vaccine hopes. AUD/USD drifted off session lows ~0.6520 (vs. high 0.6550) amid a pullback in the DXY, with the 100 and 21DMAs both residing at 0.6490. The Kiwi meanwhile fares modestly worse as the AUD/NZD cross found a current base at 1.0700. NZD/USD meanwhile sees itself just under 0.6100 (vs. high 0.6108) but threatening Friday’s low at 0.6079.</p><p>JPY - Modest losses for the Japanese currency, albeit more-so a function of the firmer Buck. Reports noted that Japan is to lift the state of emergency declaration in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Hokkaido today. USD/JPY sees itself hovering on either side of its 55 DMA (107.71) vs. its overnight low at 107.54 and ahead of its 50 DMA at 107.91..</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Given the market closures, in both the UK and US today, the schedule is unsurprisingly light and price action has for the most part has been rangebound. <strong>Core</strong> <strong>counterparts</strong> started the week off firmer as protest action ramped up in Hong Kong in protest to the proposed national security law with an analysis piece available for this on Newsquawk headline feed. Aside from this, newsflow has been relatively sparse aside from the German Ifo survey which came in slightly mixed, with 2/3 measures beating expectations and was accompanied by, relatively speaking, cautiously optimistic commentary for some sectors ahead. However, this release did nothing to spur price action in the <strong>Bund</strong> which has been gradually relinquishing the mild early-doors bid since the European cash open as sentiment has slowly improved. Trade which has seen the core EU debt measure remain within a narrow 25-tick range so far (172.98-173.28). Price action within the <strong>periphery</strong> is similarly contained as focus moves to Wednesday’s presentation of the European recovery package, which is already under threat via an alternative proposal from the ‘frugal four’ which would provide loans not grants; and therefore, likely place substantially pressure on the finances of areas including Italy and Spain. Finally, USTs are essentially flat, with no cash trade state-side, and futures having seen a pullback similar to their EU peer; focus for the US this week is on the PCE and GDP prints.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures see mild gains in early trade with traded volumes on the lighter side amid absences from UK and US markets/participants; while fresh fundamental news flow remains light. Eyes remain on the wider implications on global trade and sentiment from the fallout of the US-Sino trade spat threatening a cold war, whilst investors must not be distraction from the prospects of reinstated lockdowns should COVID-19 cases rise again. On Friday, the Baker Hughes rig count printed another decline in active rigs, whilst OPEC Secretary General Barkindo posited tentative signs of recovery and we believe the worst is behind us. WTI July meanders around USD 33.50/bbl (USD 32.50-33.75/bbl range), whilst Brent July sees itself oscillating between gains and losses, now residing north of USD 35/bbl (34.50-35.40 range). Spot gold moves in tandem to the Buck as sees itself with mild intraday losses around USD 1730/oz (USD 1724-35 band) whilst copper mimics price action in stocks to reclaim USD 2.40/lb to the upside.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong> Over the weekend, protesters took to the streets to rally against the Mainland’s planned national security law – effectively banning all activities aimed at toppling the central government and the influence on Hong Kong affairs. Multiple rounds of tear gas were fired by Hong Kong police whilst water cannons were used to deter congregations of protesters.</p><p><strong>WIDER IMPLICATIONS:</strong> The National Security law has been met with a raft of resistance from 23 countries, who all issued a statement calling it “comprehensive assault on the city’s autonomy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms”.</p><ul><li><strong>US REACTION:</strong> US National Security Adviser O’Brien stated that the US government will likely impose economic sanctions on Hong Kong and China if China moves forward with national security law for Hong Kong. This would see Hong Kong’s special status removed that allowed it to function as an international financial hub.</li><li><strong>EU REACTION:</strong> The EU urged China to respect Hong Kong’s autonomy and the ‘One Country Two Systems’ principle and said it “considers that democratic debate, consultation of key stakeholders, and respect for protected rights and freedoms in Hong Kong would represent the best way of proceeding with the adoption of national security legislation”, whilst stating developments will be followed closely. Meanwhile, Hong Kong protests leader Joshua Wong said he wants the EU to impose sanctions on Chinese politicians over the law.</li><li><strong>UK REACTION:</strong> UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a 50yr agreement to the “one country, two systems” governance. Some believe Britain has too much at stake to confront China over Hong Kong; on this, new legal advice suggests the UK could open its doors to Hong Kong citizens. Meanwhile, Telegraph said PM Johnson was reportedly planning to reduce Huawei’s involvement in the UK 5G network within the next three years.</li></ul>",

Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) lagged their regional peers with the mainland bourse choppy amid ongoing US-China tensions and with the Hong Kong benchmark extending on last Friday’s near-6% slump after thousands of protester rallied on Sunday against China’s national security law, while the protests were met heavy handed by the police which used pepper spray and a water cannon to disperse the crowd.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week mostly higher following last Friday’s recovery on Wall St. where the US major indices gradually clawed back opening losses after encouraging comments from NIH’s Fauci and US plans for large Phase 2 trials spurred vaccine-related optimism. ASX 200 (+1.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) are higher with tech and energy front running the broad gains seen across Australia’s sectors, while sentiment in Tokyo is underpinned by expectations the state of emergency will be lifted today in all remaining areas including the capital and with the government reportedly considering compiling a new package mostly consisting of financial support to companies which would be funded by a second supplementary budget valued more than JPY 100tln. Hang Seng (-1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) lag their regional peers with the mainland bourse choppy amid ongoing US-China tensions and with the Hong Kong benchmark extending on last Friday’s near-6% slump after thousands of protester rallied on Sunday against China’s national security law which was met heavy handed by the police which used pepper spray and a water cannon to disperse the crowd.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre with price action rangebound beneath the 100.00 level owing to the absence of key global markets at the start of the week with both London and New York shut in observance of the Spring Bank Holiday and Memorial Day respectively, while the early optimism at the beginning of Asia trade also contributed the greenback’s lack of appeal. Nonetheless, its major counterparts failed to capitalize on this with EUR/USD subdued after it relinquished the 1.0900 handle to the downside and with GBP/USD restrained below 1.2200 as PM Johnson is said to face Cabinet revolt after supporting senior adviser Cummings who faced calls to resign after breaching the lockdown. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy amid the uneventful greenback and lack of global FX participants, which has also resulted to drab price action for antipodean currencies and follows the weakest CNY reference rate setting by the PBoC since early 2008.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally lower amid gains in Japanese stocks but with downside stemmed by the BoJ ‘s presence in the market for nearly JPY 1.1tln of JGBs mostly concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
