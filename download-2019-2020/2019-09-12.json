Kroger (KR) had a choppy day of trade after beating on EPS but in its sales conference said sales improvements were taking longer than expected, it traded higher at the close. Visa (V) was at the top of Dow, catching tailwinds after closing its acquisition of Verifi following final approvals; Boeing (BA) was at bottom, paring back some of Wednesday’s optimism on 737 MAX flight return spurred by the CEO. Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) were weighing on industrials after Wells Fargo downgraded the pair, citing cyclical peaks had been reached. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was an outperformer after receiving an upgrade at Nomura and positive comments from Jefferies. PayPal (PYPL) traded near the top of the Nasdaq 100 after Canaccord assumed the payments Co with a Buy rating. S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3010, Nasdaq-100 0.4% at 7917, Dow Jones 0.2% at 27185.</p><p>The TPLEX, and EGBs, were whipped about in the wake of the ECB. The initial announcement of fresh open-ended QE spiked futures; however, as participants read between the lines of the fresh stimulus, bonds pared reversed their initial move, with some desks attributing little detail of whether the ECB would add more asset classes to its QE programme, and that Draghi said the ECB is not yet ready to change the issue and issuer limits, and that EUR 20bln p.m. was a suitable pace of purchases (EUR 20bln p.m. was towards the lower end of QE estimates bare in mind). At settlement, yields were higher by approximately 6bps across the entire Treasury curve. US T-notes (z9) settled 15 ticks lower at 129-14.</p>",

The Bank cut its deposit rate further into negative territory, with a reduction of 10bps to -0.50%, leaning back on some calls for a deeper cut of 20bps. Additionally, policymakers opted to relaunch the APP at a clip of EUR 20bln p.m. from November, which at first might have disappointed the consensus view, which sought a rate of EUR 30bln p.m. However, the open-ended nature of the purchases helped assuage some of those concerns, albeit there was no change to the issuer limit that some had been looking for. Furthermore, in terms of forward guidance on rates, the next rate hike will not occur until the inflation outlook “robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics”. As an additional sweetener, the Bank also made the terms of its future TLTRO operations more favourable. Amid concerns surrounding bank profitability in the region (alongside the prolongation of negative rates), policymakers opted to introduce a tiering system which “exempts part of credit institutions’ excess liquidity holdings (i.e. reserve holdings in excess of minimum reserve requirements) from negative remuneration at the rate applicable on the deposit facility”. Note, Draghi later leaned-back against the suggestion that such a move was carried out to protect bank profitability, and instead said the measures were imposed to help enhance the transmission of monetary policy measures.</p><p><strong>During the press conference</strong>, Draghi noted that incoming information indicates a more protracted weakness of the Eurozone economy, with this sentiment reflected in the accompanying staff economic projections which saw 2019 and 2020 estimates lowered (2019 lowered to 1.1% from 1.2%, 2020 cut from 1.4% to 1.2%) with 2021 left unchanged at 1.4%. From an inflation perspective, the outgoing ECB chief noted that inflation was likely to decline before rising towards year-end, whilst measures of underlying inflation remain 'muted'. As such 2019-21 inflation projections were reduced with 2020 cut aggressively to just 1% from 1.4%, but it is worth noting that these projections were made prior to the unveiling of today’s stimulus measures, and thus may not incorporate how policymakers perceive 2020’s inflation prospects. Elsewhere, Draghi was careful to stress the need for fiscal measures alongside the Bank’s monetary policy efforts, with the President suggesting that the ECB were unanimous in believing that fiscal policy should become the main instrument in Europe. With regards to the overall unanimity of today’s decisions, Draghi stated that there was broad agreement on forward guidance, rate cut, reinvestments and TLTRO, whilst there was more diversity of views on asset purchases. Furthermore, there was a full agreement on the need to act, however, there was a difference of views on the severity of the outlook.</p><p><strong>In terms of the overall take</strong> of the release, judging by the initial market reaction at 1245BST, despite just the 10bps cut, the stimulus package as a whole appeared to exceed market expectations. However, the question now is whether or not the measures taken today will be enough to help the Bank achieve its inflation goals; something which ABN AMRO have pushed-back on by suggesting that despite the open-ended nature of the QE programme, it is overall too small in size to raise inflation significantly over the next 2-3 years. Ultimately, the ECB is facing a number of headwinds external to the Eurozone and its mandate, and as such, and as concluded by Pantheon Macroeconomics, the main message from today’s ECB release is “We’re all in, but it might not work unless fiscal policymakers step up.”</p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES: </strong>French, German, Dutch, Austrian and Estonian were among the ECB Governors which opposed the QE resumption, according to sources, which passed via a narrow majority. President Draghi did allude to this in the presser as he stated there was a more diverse view across the board on asset purchases. Interestingly, the French also opposed QE, which follows on from commentary from Villeroy who was seemingly sitting on the fence as he questioned whether now was the right time to implement QE, albeit, now appears to have fallen onto the hawkish side of the fence for the QE decision, alongside the ECB’s notably hawkish Northern members.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP ON FED: </strong>Following the ECB announcement, US President Trump was quick to judge, by tweeting the ECB are trying and succeeding in depreciating the Euro against a very strong dollar, whilst criticising the Fed saying they ‘sit, sit, and sit.’</p><p><strong>* TRUMP POSTPONES TARIFFS:</strong> As a gesture of goodwill, President Trump announced that hikes to levies on imports of certain Chinese goods from 25% to 30%, that were planned for 1st October, will be delayed by two weeks (to the 15th October, and crucially, after the PRC's 70th Anniversary on 1st October). The move followed a request from China Vice Premier Liu He, and comes after the Chinese also delayed some tariffs this week while making friendly noises about buying US agriculture (though pork and soybeans remain exempted, indicating China will continue to use it as a bargaining chip ahead of the 2020 elections) -- which has provided favourable optics for Trump to take this decision -- ahead of key talks that are set to get underway in September between the two sides, ahead of face-to-face trade talks in October. Politico reported later in the session, via a source, that Trump’s advisors were “rushing” to avoid the approaching tariffs and fall back to the “90% done” deal which fell apart back in May. This echoed some reports that the advisors were looking for an interim deal to delay the tariffs, but a senior administration official denied these.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TSF: </strong>Surprised to the upside, though overall credit growth edged lower. The data will add to calls for more stimulus, UBS said, given the rising downward growth pressure from higher tariffs and slowing domestic activities. UBS sees the government increasing policy support in the coming year, and sees the PBOC firing another 50bps worth of RRR cuts through the rest of 2019, and 100bps cuts in 2020. The central bank might also cut the new policy rate (MLF rate and LPR) by 10-15bps following the expected Fed rate cuts, UBS says, as China is now facing more disinflation (non-food CPI) or deflation (PPI) pressures than the inflationary one from surging hog prices.</p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>Headline CPI rose +0.1% M/M, in line with the consensus; the core rose by +0.3% M/M, slightly above consensus, and the third straight +0.3% reading, lifting the Y/Y core rate to 2.4%, an annual rate last seen in 2008; analysts also noted that the three-month annualised rate rose to 3.4%, a 13-year high. \"The outsized core increase came despite below-trend increases in primary and owner-equivalent rents, which account for 41% of the index and are likely to rebound over the next couple of months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"instead, the damage was done by a 1.1% jump in used car prices, the third straight hefty increase, and a 1.4% surge in hospital services costs, lifting the Y/Y rate to 2.1%, from 0.8% in July.\" Pantheon says it probably won’t be repeated, and the trend rate increase is still very slow. \"Accordingly, we’re not ready yet to argue with conviction that the trend in the core CPI is now running at 0.3% per month. But the next few months likely will see a hit from tariffs pass-through - the first batch of tariffs on imported Chinese consumer goods were imposed on September 1 - as well as a rebound in rents, so core inflation is unlikely to fall and could easily rise further, thanks to adverse base effects from modest gains in the final few months of last year,\" the economic consultancy highlights that market-based inflation expectations are low.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN FISCAL SPENDING: </strong>It was reported via sources that<strong> </strong>Germany's lower-than-expected borrowing costs could create additional fiscal room of some EUR 5bln this year, with possibly more.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said there are currently no plans for US President Trump to meet with Iranian President Rouhani and the US is still maintaining maximum pressure on Iran; pushing back on some of the progressive comments from the US made recently. President Trump, in push back to speculation that former National Security Advisor Bolton was too “hard-line”, said, “my views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back!”</p><p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY OIL REPORT: </strong>Maintained its oil demand growth estimates for 2019 and 2020 at 1.1mln BPD and 1.3mln BPD, respectively. This was in contrast to both OPEC’s Monthly Report and EIA’s STEO cutting their 2019 oil demand growth forecasts by 80k and 100k BPD to 1.02mln BPD and 0.900mln BPD, respectively. Additionally, both of the prior releases cut 2020 global oil demand. Elsewhere in the report, IEA sees US expansion, plus big gains from Norway and Brazil, is set to boost non-OPEC growth from 1.9mln BPD this year to 2.3mln BPD in 2020. The non-OPEC surge will cut the need for OPEC crude to 28.3mln BPD in 1H20, 1.4mln bpd below the group’s August output, the report said.</p><p><strong>* OPEC JMMC: </strong>The new<strong> </strong>Saudi Energy Minister, Abdulaziz, said deeper cut discussions will be left for the next OPEC meeting in December; something which Oman’s Oil Minister also alluded too. In contradiction, there were earlier sources reports that members were discussing whether to enhance compliance with the cuts with an additional 400k BPD from the current 1.2mln BPD reduction, but ultimately this failed to materialise into an official announcement. Although there was discussion about lack of commitment from members including Iraq and Nigeria, with Iraq seemingly taking a more proactive stance to meet its commitments going forward. Abdulaziz said Saudi will continue to over comply with oil cuts, the Kingdom's October production will be 9.89mln BPD and remain below 10mln BPD through the remainder of the year, and there is a clear readiness by OPEC+ to be responsive. Russian Energy Minister Novak noted that OPEC+ did not discuss the possibility of extending the production pact into 2020, adding it's too early for such a discussion.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLED USD 0.66 LOWER AT USD 55.09/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLED USD 0.43 LOWER AT USD 60.38/BBL:</strong> Crude futures trade lower again on Thursday where hopes of immediate extended production cuts at the OPEC+ JMMC meeting failed to materialise.&nbsp; Analysts at Citi note that the IEA’s Oil Market Report highlighting the “daunting” prospect of a projected 2020 surplus was a headwind for the complex. Ultimately, energy markets failed to take cues from higher equity prices, but prices did drift modesty from the lows through the US session.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (Z9) SETTLES 15 TICKS LOWER AT 129-14.</strong> The TPLEX, and EGBs, were whipped about in the wake of the ECB. The initial announcement of fresh open-ended QE spiked futures; however, as participants read between the lines of the fresh stimulus, bonds pared reversed their initial move, with some desks attributing little detail of whether the ECB would add more asset classes to its QE programme, and that Draghi said the ECB is not yet ready to change the issue and issuer limits, and that EUR 20bln p.m. was a suitable pace of purchases (EUR 20bln p.m. was towards the lower end of QE estimates bare in mind). At settlement, yields were higher by approximately 6bps across the entire Treasury curve.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>The<strong> </strong>30-year auction high yield was 2.27%, a multi-year low, and had a chunky tail of 1.6bps, weaker than the six-auction average of 0.8bps. The B/C of 2.22x came more-or-less in-line with the average, however. The takedown was also okay, with primaries taking less than average, whilst both directs and indirects took above.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The DUP have softened their stance, according to The Times, and may agree keeping Northern Ireland aligned to EU rules on agriculture, forming an all-Ireland agricultural zone, as long as the Northern Irish Assembly has a say in the development of new rules. There was also a suggestion the DUP might be agreeable to allowing single-market regulatory checks on goods being transported between Northern Ireland and mainland UK. \"This is just the resurrection of the original ‘Northern-Irish’ backstop, or elements of it, that was first proposed (and objected to by the DUP) in December 2017,\" RBC writes, \"agri-food is thought to cover only around 30% of cross-border Irish trade, however, so the EU and Ireland is likely to push for this new, 'not the Northern Ireland only backstop', to cover more sectors before agreeing to it.\" Elsewhere, after a Scottish court declared the government's move to prorogue parliament 'illegal', the government has said parliament will remain suspended, pending appeal. UK Speaker Bercow said later in the session that Parliament will impose more \"draconian\" measures if he attempts to bypass new law ruling out a no deal next month.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: EUR </strong>saw choppy price action today given the ECB rate decision, on the announcement EUR weakened as they cut rates as expected and introduced an open-ended QE programme. However, as Draghi finished his presser the moves reversed with desks citing the actual size of QE, 20bln per month, being rather small and therefore expect the macroeconomic impact to be relatively modest, despite the open-ended nature. Others also highlight that money markets no longer expect the ECB to cut rates again this year. The single currency headed into Asia back above 1.1050, heading towards 1.11. <strong>TRY</strong> was the outperforming currency despite a 325bp cut as the central bank hinted towards a normalising economy with inflation levels expected to continue downwards. <strong>USD </strong>largely took its moves from the ECB and price action opposed that of the EUR, where it strengthened on the release and weakened as markets digested the moves; US CPI did little to add direction to the buck. <strong>JPY </strong>traded weaker overnight as there were further positive trade developments from the US &amp; China, however the losses were short lived as the currency strengthened heading into ECB. As the central bank delivered the safe haven currency initially strengthened where USDJPY found resistance just above Wednesday’s low of 107.50 before paring back the moves as markets digested the central banks moves. <strong>EMFX, (ZAR,MXN)</strong> were stronger against the greenback following the ECB rate decision, <strong>BRL</strong> also aided by strong service sector growth data. <strong>XAU </strong>pared back ECB gains to end little changed.</p><p><strong>* CBRT: </strong>The Turkish Central Bank cut rates by 325bps to 16.5%, overdelivering relative to the consensus view, which was looking for a 250bp cut. This reduction combined with the prior 425bp cut now takes rates back beneath the level before their emergency 625bp hike last year. Despite the deep cut, the Lira strengthened as the Central Bank sounded confident about the seemingly normalising economy, with inflation forecasts now expected to be even lower than forecasted in July, whilst also stating that inflation outlook is continuing to improve, citing August’s inflation data. To keep inflation tracking lower, the CBRT will continue its cautious monetary policy stance, and the extent of monetary tightening will further depend on inflation developments. ING’s analysts note that despite the further front-loading by the central bank, it should be cautious as inflation expectations are still not well anchored with high inertia, especially in services inflation, as well as global economic uncertainty due to trade tensions weighing on global growth. ING also highlights geopolitical issues still remain in Turkey, and ‘there is ongoing high dollarization and a subdued capital flow outlook’.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3010, Nasdaq-100 0.4% at 7917, Dow Jones 0.2% at 27185</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.5%, Consumer Staples 0.3%, Energy -0.6%, Financials 0.5%, Health Care -0.1%, Industrials 0.1%, Information Technology 0.5%, Materials 0.7%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Oracle (ORCL) dived on the open after the announcement its CEO would be leaving unexpectedly, with investors putting a decent earnings report in the back seat; DXC Technologies’ (DXC) CEO departure also sent the stock diving. Kroger (KR) had a choppy day of trade after beating on EPS but in its sales conference said sales improvements were taking longer than expected, it traded higher at the close. Visa (V) was at the top of Dow, catching tailwinds after closing its acquisition of Verifi following final approvals; Boeing (BA) was at bottom, paring back some of Wednesday’s optimism on 737 MAX flight return spurred by the CEO. Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) were weighing on industrials after Wells Fargo downgraded the pair, citing cyclical peaks had been reached. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was an outperformer after receiving an upgrade at Nomura and positive comments from Jefferies. PayPal (PYPL) traded near the top of the Nasdaq 100 after Canaccord assumed the payments Co with a Buy rating.</p>",

The initial announcement of fresh open-ended QE spiked futures; however, as participants read between the lines of the fresh stimulus, bonds pared reversed their initial move, with some desks attributing little detail of whether the ECB would add more asset classes to its QE programme, and that Draghi said the ECB is not yet ready to change the issue and issuer limits, and that EUR 20bln p.m. was a suitable pace of purchases (EUR 20bln p.m. was towards the lower end of QE estimates bare in mind). At settlement, yields were higher by approximately 6bps across the entire Treasury curve.</li><li><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>The<strong> </strong>30-year auction high yield was 2.27%, a multi-year low, and had a chunky tail of 1.6bps, weaker than the six-auction average of 0.8bps. The B/C of 2.22x came more-or-less in-line with the average, however. The takedown was also okay, with primaries taking less than average, whilst both directs and indirects took above.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong>&nbsp;The US Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wednesday), and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Thursday); UBS notes that that there will be around USD 26bln of cashflows (ex-SOMA) this week, including USD 24bln of redemptions and USD 2bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> Thursday's 30s auction is complicated by the ECB policy meeting, as well as the release of August CPI out of the US, both of which are on the slate for before the auction. SocGen's strategists say that, from a relative-value perspective, the 30-year sector appears rich in asset swap versus the previous 30s auction cycle. Recently, five of the six 30-year auctions have tailed, and cover ratios have been easing. \"This shows that investors in general are shying away from the 30y auction,\" SocGen argues, \"moreover, the 30-year yield reached an all-time low at end-August, and although it has since increased slightly, it is unlikely that the upcoming auction will attract favourable bidding.\" On the positive side, the bank notes relatively low dealers’ holdings, as well as the current 30-year trading special in repo, which might be supportive. With that said, the two aforementioned events complicate the auction, adding event risk, and accordingly, SocGen says it is neutral to slightly negative on the auction.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/07ca7436-970b-4386-bdf8-ea1622de6b77.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR/TRY</strong></p><p>Much was expected of the ECB and CBRT in the build up to their respective September policy meetings, and in pure physical terms both delivered. In short, the former cut the key depo rate by 10 bp, enhanced TLTRO3 terms and extended the maturity from 2 years to 3, restarted QE with effect November 1 at Eur20 bn/month for an unspecified period and reinforced forward guidance by removing any calendar-based timeframe with a commitment to keeping rates at current or lower levels until such time that inflation (headline and core) and expectations are robustly convergent and stable around the target level. However, after an initial spike the Euro sold off and Eur/Usd got to within a whisker of 1.0923 ytd lows before turning full circle and more (towards 1.1069 highs) as President Draghi’s press conference and Q&amp;A unfolded. Short covering a likely factor, but hard to justify or rationalise the turnaround bar GC division over restarting asset purchases and unanimity in the view that fiscal policy should now take the strain. In contrast, the Lira rallied and remains significantly stronger vs the Dollar on the back of a 325 bp Turkish ease vs 250-275 bp consensus as the CBRT acknowledged a marked retreat in August CPI and said the inflation outlook is now more benign than it was in July. Usd/Try is hovering around 5.6650 vs 5.7680+ at the other extreme, with investors cheering the prospect that prices may be back to target sooner and rates more normal in accordance.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Greenback has been on a roller-coaster ride amidst increasingly bullish US-China trade headlines/reports, but mainly dovetailing the manic moves in the single currency noted above, and that were not exclusively confined to Eur/Usd. The <strong>DXY </strong>spiked to 99.109 and close to 2019 peaks before reversing sharply to sub-98.500 again with little discernible reaction somewhat mixed US data in the form of CPI and claims. However, the <strong>CNH</strong> remained on a firmer footing between 7.1085-0525 despite talk that the Trump admin may be looking at an interim deal with China quickly denied.</p><p><strong>CHF/AUD/NZD/GBP/JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>All off extremes against the Usd and now more narrowly mixed, but the Franc, Aussie and Kiwi remain on the front foot vs underperformance in Sterling, Yen and Loonie. Usd/Chf is back above the 0.9900 handle, Aud/Usd midway between 0.6895-60 and Nzd/Usd hovering within a 0.6410-50 range awaiting the NZ manufacturing PMI for some independent impetus. Meanwhile, Cable has reclaimed 1.2300+ status alongside the aforementioned Eur/Usd revival and maintaining vigilance on UK political/Brexit news, as Usd/Jpy pivots 108.00 and Usd/Cad holds nearer the upper end of 1.3215-1.3175 parameters against the backdrop of retreating oil prices.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>The G10 laggard as crude reversed course post-JMMC with no sign of any further output cuts and US-Iran meeting speculation continued to circulate, but Eur/Nok may also have rebounded smartly from around 9.8300 to 9.9000+ on the back of the ECB and suspicions that policy action may influence the hawkish Norges Bank next week.</p>",

Perhaps most notably, Draghi revealed the ECB's inflation forecast has been significantly lowered, to 1.2% in 2019 (prev. 1.3%), <strong>1.0% for 2020 (prev. 1.4%) </strong>and 1.5% (prev. 1.6%). On this news, EURUSD fell from 1.0965 to 1.0928 (just above YTD lows), although has since rebound somewhat. DAX Sep' 19 futures, which had pared back from post-statement release highs, extended gains to 12471, setting fresh highs for the month of September. Meanwhile, Bund yields appear to have stabilised at around -0.64bps, although periphery bonds continue to extend gains.&nbsp;</p>",

Indeed, Bunds have catapulted to 175.62 (+138 ticks) and dragged bond peers with them (or rather core counterparts as the periphery is outperforming), while the Euro is back under the cosh and getting closer to ytd lows vs the Dollar. Note, as a result the DXY has almost revisited the 99.000 marker.</p>",

Conversely, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

The US delay of the tariff increase to 30% from 25% on USD 250bln of Chinese goods was also said to have left some dissatisfied in which Global Times noted comments that the postponement does not mean a big improvement as talks remain tough, while it was also suggested that the delay is far from enough and some called for a removal of the extra tariffs.

In the run up to 12.45BST and 13.30BST, a spread of hefty option expiries should keep Eur/Usd occupied and contained, with 1.1 bn at 1.0970-80, 1.5 bn at 1.1000 and 1.8 bn between 1.1040-55 vs the 1.1006-32 range so far.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CHF</strong> - The Antipodean Dollars are just outperforming the Franc at the head of the G10 ranks, as US-China trade relations continue to thaw via President Trump responding to Beijing’s goodwill gesture by delaying planned tariff hikes on Chinese goods for 14 days from October 1 to 15. However, the recently lagging Kiwi has benefited most this time, with Nzd/Usd regaining a firmer foothold above 0.6400, while the Aussie continues to face heavy resistance and cross-winds ahead of 0.6900 and over 1.0700 in Aud/Nzd. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf has retreated towards 0.9900 again, shrugging off softer Swiss producer/import prices, but aided by a broad Buck fade (DXY slipping back to pivot 98.500 compared to a 98.746 peak yesterday) and the aforementioned still defensive Eur (cross meandering from 1.0945 to 1.0915).</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/GBP</strong> - All on a softer footing, as the Loonie hands back more gains having failed to sustain its rally beyond 1.3150 and a further downturn in crude prices also weighs on sentiment ahead of US CPI, initial claims and more Canadian housing data. Usd/Cad has subsequently extended to almost 1.3200, in line with Usd/Jpy rising through 108.00 before waning around the 100 DMA (108.15), but holding above decent expiry interest at 107.50-60 (1.6 bn). Elsewhere, Sterling has faded some distance from recent peaks and short of 1.2350 amidst less than positive reports from the EU on the subject of a Brexit breakthrough, as the UK has still not provided a real alternative to the Irish border backstop. Cable is currently just above the 55 DMA (1.2311) circa 1.2325.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Broad gains across the region in part due to the constructive US-China trade developments and the Dollar’s loss of momentum noted above, but with the Yuan also heeding another steady PBoC reference rate overnight, while the Lira has regained some composure into the CBRT after markedly underperforming of late amidst aggressive easing forecasts – again a more detailed primer is available via the Ransquawk website.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s tough if not remotely possible to ascertain just how much residual pre-ECB positioning has occurred or remains to be done, but suffice to say that it has been a material factor as the clock ticks down to the first of the 2 major events. Interestingly, although Eurozone bonds are all off best levels, the core is holding up better than the periphery and this is likely to be a risk-reward dynamic as there is more to lose on the margins if the GC fails to deliver or live up to lofty expectations. Meanwhile, <strong>Gilts</strong> have recoiled to a new Liffe base at 132.28 and again this may be indirectly due to the looming ECB and spread trades, but also Brexit/politically motivated as UK PM Johnson continues to face the wrath of Remain MPs and the courts for suspending parliament. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are relatively subdued and the curve remarkably flat (on the day) into US CPI, weekly claims and the final leg of this week’s supply (long bonds) after a better, though hardly strong 10 year offering on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures have been dipping in recent trade after a sideways overnight session, with the JMMC meeting in Abu Dhabi underway. Commentary from oil ministers has largely surrounded the need to bring compliance to 100% for all members. Sources also noted that the oil producers are holding discussions over whether to enhance compliance with oil cuts, which could result in an effective output reduction of around 400k bpd; although, this may be less than participants envisaged. Furthermore, the new-appointed Saudi Energy Minister stated that the Kingdom will continue to over-comply, whilst noting that Saudi October production will be 9.89mln BPD, up from the August level of 9.63mln BPD, which could have added pressure in the oil complex. WTI and Brent futures currently reside below 55.50/bbl and 60.50/bbl ahead of the ECB Monetary Policy decision. Elsewhere, gold prices have reclaimed the 1500/oz to the upside amid a weaker USD and nervousness that the ECB could disappoint. It’s also worth keeping in mind that President Trump delaying the China tariffs does not ultimately change the landscape in regard to sticking points, with China noting that talks remain tough and there will be no compromises on IP if it stalls China’s growth. Copper, on the other hand, has extended gains above the 2.60/lb level ahead of its 100 DMA at 2.66/lb amid continued hope that Chinese stimulus will buoy the demand side of the equation.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>JPM notes the recent acceleration in the rotation from Momentum into Value, the former of which has sold off 10% and the latter gained 7% since Monday. This was one of the largest 3-day Momentum-Value rotations in over 30 years, observes the bank, who argues the move has been triggered by a combination of better than expected economic data, monetary and fiscal stimulus, easing trade tensions, stabilization in yields, all at a time when factor positioning (long Momentum and Short Value) was extreme. Moreover, while the initial part of the rotation has been largely technical (mostly down to short covering), another phase of rotation is likely to be supported by an upturn in the business/profit cycle.</li><li>In that regard, with renewed synchronized global monetary easing and stimulus underway, JPM says, liquidity conditions have already started to improve based on free liquidity ratio, lending activity, and credit growth. This, the bank argues, typically proceeds improved growth by roughly 6 months. Moreover, more positive impulses for growth could come in the form of an easing of US-China trade tensions; with US Presidential elections quickly approaching, JPM take the view that trade tensions should ease into 2020. As such, the bank sees the likelihood of an intra-cycle rebound in the months ahead as more plausible than that of the beginning of an outright recession.</li><li>If this view proves correct, the extreme divergence between Momentum/Low Vol and Value is likely to see a further rebalance. Under these circumstances, the bank defends its 2019 S&amp;P 500 price target of 3,000 throughout this year and sees further upside to 3,200 by mid 2020 (which could come sooner if US/China trade discussions continue to improve).</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, STIR contracts appear a bit more reticent again, but the 3 month strip has pared/reversed relatively light declines of -0.5 to -1.5 ticks to probe 1 tick above parity awaiting today’s headline ECB event. In terms of the domestic agenda, nothing scheduled again, while the overnight RICS house price balance and latest political/Brexit news is not providing much in the way of independent direction. Note however, Gilts and Short Sterling continue to lag/underperform in wake of this week’s above forecast data and passage of the anti-no deal Brexit bill.</p>",

Easing expectations are keeping dip-buyers engaged into the eagerly awaited and anticipated September ECB policy verdict and President Draghi’s post-meeting press conference that could make up for any initial disappointment if the actual stimulus delivered falls short of ‘expectations’. However, market consensus is arguably more uncertain than ever or for a very long time given mixed messages from GC members and the various sources. Indeed, depo rate forecasts range from -50 to -60 bp, while QE calls span Eur20-30 bn per month for a year to Eur45 bn and amounts in between for 6-9 months as well, or no further asset purchases at all for now. Even the prospect of tiering is not clear-cut, but one major vendor suggests up to 30% of excess reserves could be exempt if a system is unveiled. Hence, the reaction to what unfolds looks all set to be big one way or another.</p>",

Analysts note that the rise has been led by real yields, which could be an indication that the market perceives central banks will disappointing in their largesse in the weeks ahead (ECB tomorrow, a package of measures is expected, but recent newsflow has suggested it might not be as aggressive as markets would desire, while the idea of an FOMC 50bps cut has dissipated after Powell's remarks last week).

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region sustains the momentum from Wall St where US-China trade concessions fuelled the S&amp;P 500 past the 3000 milestone and the DJIA back above 27k after China announced a tariff exemption list on imports from US, while US President Trump later reciprocated by delaying the next round of tariffs to October 15th from October 1st. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) are higher with support seen across the trade sensitive sectors in Australia aside from energy amid recent losses in oil, while the Japanese benchmark is underpinned by a weaker currency and following better than expected Machine Orders data. Conversely, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are mixed despite the encouraging trade developments as some suggested China’s olive branch could be to ease pressure from its weakening economy. The US delay of the tariff increase to 30% from 25% on USD 250bln of Chinese goods was also said to have left some dissatisfied with Global Times noting comments that the postponement does not mean a big improvement as talks remain tough, while it was also suggested that the delay is far from enough and some called for a removal of the extra tariffs. Furthermore, the downside in Hong Kong was led by the blue-chip energy names and with HKEX slumping after its recent GBP 32bln proposal for LSE which raised doubts regarding political risk and the deal structure.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is steady and holds on to the prior day’s gains which were attributed to firmer than expected PPI data and rebound in US 10yr yields, as well as the more constructive US-China trade developments. Furthermore, the greenback’s transatlantic counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD languishing near 1.1000 ahead of today’s ECB where there are high expectations for fresh stimulus measures but also fears of potential disappointment given that markets are heavily one-sided, while GBP/USD is also uneventful as the government continues to defy Parliament’s wishes and with UK PM Johnson steadfast in his ‘do or die’ Brexit stance. Elsewhere, USD/JPY reclaimed the 108.00 handle for the first time in over a month as the US-China concessions spurred safe-haven outflows, and CNH also strengthened from the trade developments which in turn underpinned antipodeans due to their China exposure, as well as high-beta characteristics.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs declined amid the improvement in trade relations and after similar declines in USTs as yields rebounded, but with losses stemmed amid the BoJ presence for JPY 680bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>",
