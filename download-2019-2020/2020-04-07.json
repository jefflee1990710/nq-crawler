Early doors, the risk stars were aligning (Treasuries bear-steepened, dollar down, oil up, equity futures rallying), although the conviction eased throughout the session, and the situation is a little more tentative as the Asia day beckons, SPX even entered negative territory just before the close. The main themes are OPEC, and the challenges around engineering a globally coordinated supply cut this week (meeting on Thursday; G20 energy ministers meet on Friday). European players are also on the lookout for an update from the Eurogroup, which is expected to rubber-stamp a massive stimulus package that could be worth up to 5% of the bloc’s GDP. US equities are now up about 25% from the March trough, with the slate of coronavirus updates providing some encouragement; the Wuhan province is also starting to open up in China, potentially offering statisticians some insight into how lockdowns may play out in the US and in Europe. Some desks, however, suggested that the US upside could be a result of liquidity, volatility, positioning conditions which are exacerbating moves, given the market a choppy feel. Boeing (BA) announced it is to temporarily suspend its 787 operations at the South Carolina facility. Exxon Mobil (XOM) cut its 2020 CapEx by 30% and OpEx by 15%, noting the largest share of CapEx reductions will be in the Permian Basin. XOM maintained its long-term outlook. 3M (MMM) and the Trump administration resolved its dispute, while MMM is to import 166.5mln respirators over three months. Kraft Heinz (KHC) expects Q1 net sales growth of 3%, above analyst expectations for a sales decline. AT&amp;T (T) will continue to pay quarterly dividends and it has entered a new USD 5.5bln term loan agreement with banks. Stocks that have been heavily hit of late due to COVID saw a decent rally on Tuesday; travel names were bid, with cruise operators (CCL, NCLH, RCL) up ~20% while Airlines (AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV) were up 10-15% in the morning. Note, the opposite was seen with some of the winners from COVID-19 fallout, which endured some losses; Slack (WORK), Zoom (ZM) and DocuSign (DOCU) in negative territory. Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Infineon (IFX GY, IFNNY) received antitrust clearance in China, expects deal to be completed April 16th. Abercrombie and Fitch (ANF) and Ralph Laruen (RL) furlough in store workers. Activision (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) were rated as new overweight and new equal weight, respectively, at Wells Fargo. Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX regulatory test flight has reportedly been delayed to May, according to AFP citing sources. iQIYI (IQ) was named a new short at Muddy Waters, who after working with Wolfpack Research believes the co. is a fraud. Note, Baidu (BIDU) own a hefty stake in the name. SPX -0.16% at 2659, NDX -0.40% at 8049, DJIA -0.12% at 22654.</p><p>The Treasury curve continued to bear-steepen on Tuesday, as the cocktail of an extended risk rally, further issuance (both government and corporates) and scaled-back Fed bond buying weighed. The selling began at the tail-end of the APAC session, as stock futures gained traction heading into the European day. The steepener was further supported by comments from NEC Director Kudlow, who said the Treasury was aiming to reopen the 20-year bond amid the virus outbreak – Treasury Sec. Mnuchin has made similar comments in the past. Germany announcing plans for a new 15-year bond syndication, which pressured EGBs, lending an offer across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Fed continues to remove the stabilisers, purchasing a reduced clip of USD 50bln for a second day this week, although bid/ask spreads remain tight with decent volume in the futures, indicative of healthy market depth, as opposed to the lack of such back in March when the Fed stepped in. Duration was hit further by concession ahead of the 10-year auction reopening, where the Treasury sold USD 25bln, tailing by 0.7bps, marking the lowest ever high rate on a 10-year auction; the auction otherwise printed results similar to the six-auction averages, covered 2.43x and dealers taking 27.6%. Bidders in the Treasury complex were also dissuaded as the corporate issuance bonanza continued, with nine investment grade issuers on Tuesday (versus eleven on Monday), and even a few high-yield deals coming to the market; Qatar was out with a three-part USD 10bln issue, only widened the supply for participants to digest. US T-note futures (m0) settle 16 ticks lower at 137-29.</p>",

Early doors, the risk stars were aligning (Treasuries bear-steepened, dollar down, oil up, equity futures rallying), although the conviction eased throughout the session, and the situation is a little more tentative as the Asia day beckons, SPX even entered negative territory just before the close. The main themes are OPEC, and the challenges around engineering a globally coordinated supply cut this week (meeting on Thursday; G20 energy ministers meet on Friday). European players are also on the lookout for an update from the Eurogroup, which is expected to rubber-stamp a massive stimulus package that could be worth up to 5% of the bloc’s GDP. US equities are now up about 25% from the March trough, with the slate of coronavirus updates providing some encouragement; the Wuhan province is also starting to open up in China, potentially offering statisticians some insight into how lockdowns may play out in the US and in Europe. Some desks, however, suggested that the US upside could be a result of liquidity, volatility, positioning conditions which are exacerbating moves, given the market a choppy feel.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><strong>WORLDWIDE CASES 1,414,710, DEATHS 81,248, RECOVERED 301,304.</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Tuesday (via worldometer website) against Monday:</p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>total cases 388,757 (prev. 367,004), death toll 12,400 (prev. 10,871).</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 135,586 (prev. 132,547), death toll 17,127 (prev. 16,523).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 140,511 (prev. 136,675), death toll 13,987 (prev. 13,341).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 107,458 (prev. 103,375), death toll 1,983 (prev. 1,810).</li><li><strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 81,740 (prev. 81,708), death toll 3,331 (prev. 3,331).</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 109,069 (prev. 98,010), death toll 10,328 (prev. 8,911).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>total cases 55,242 (prev. 51,608), death toll 6,159 (prev. 5,373).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>total cases 22,253 (prev. 21,657), death toll 821 (prev. 765).</li><li><strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 19,580 (prev. 18,803), death toll 2,101 (prev. 1,867).</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 17,840 (prev. 16,667), death toll 375 (prev. 323).</li><li><strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 10,331 (prev. 10,284), death toll 192 (prev. 186).</li></ul><p><i>Note figures are provided via </i><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\"><i>worldometer</i></a><i> thus there may be some discrepancies on figures provided against those stated from individual states.</i></p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>EUROGROUP: </strong>The post-meeting press conference has been delayed, and no set time provided for the rescheduled conference. The meeting was to discuss a coordinated funding response to address the COVID-19 fall out, which could see measures worth 4.5-5% of GDP.&nbsp; Sides have recently failed to reach a consensus on a bloc-wide response, with many Southern nations calling for joint bond issuance to finance any response, which had met opposition from Northern members. However, although ‘Coronabonds’ are seemingly a non-starter for now, the group may strike a deal on using the ESM bailout fund to extend credit lines with flexible conditions. Recent press reports have suggested that a three-pronged proposal is being discussed, consisting of healthcare funding via the ESM of EUR 200-240bln, EIB credit guarantees worth EUR 200bln, and an EU-wide short-shift or partial unemployment scheme from the EC worth EUR 100bln. Deutsche Bank said that a package of this size would be an impressive 4.5% of GDP and circumvents the need for Coronabonds at this stage. “The details will matter and the three elements are only temporary,” DB writes, “as the risk of a protracted pandemic rises, so too does the need to follow up this plan with a centralised demand stimulus package, for example, a large-scale EIB investment programme. So, a big meeting to watch.</p><p><strong>UK PM JOHNSON: </strong>After being admitted into an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on Monday, UK PM Johnson was stable overnight and he did not need a mechanical ventilator, according to government spokespeople, but he did receive standard oxygen treatment and was said to be breathing without assistance. Johnson asked Foreign Secretary Raab to deputise him; Raab led the coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, while Downing Street remains fully operational. NOTE: an FT journalist, citing sources,&nbsp; had reported that the PM was set to come out of the ICU, but her tweet was then removed; the reporter clarified the tweet was accurate, she just removed it due to the heavy attention it received.</p><p><strong>GERMANY: </strong>Germany’s top institutes expect the German economy to contract by 4.2% in 2020 and by 5.8% in 2021. Furthermore, the Ifo Institute stated that industrial production in Germany is set to plummet - Ifo index for production expectations dropped in March from +2.0 to -20.8, on this they assume the development is underestimated given the survey period; marks the most drastic slump since the survey began.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>US House Speaker Pelosi told Democrats she wants the next stimulus bill to be at least USD 1tln, while she is said to be seeking more directs payments and small business loans in the next bill, too. Meanwhile, President Trump noted businesses have applied for more than USD 40bln in relief loans, and also that USD 30bln in hospital aid is going out this week. Trump added that his administration could do a second round of direct payments to Americans. Regarding the small business lending programme, the Treasury has asked Congress for an additional USD 200bln funding; the recently passed USD 2trln stimulus package contained USD 349bl for the small business lending programme. The latest request comes amid strong demand just several days into the initial programme. Elsewhere, Senate Majority Leader McConnell aims to pass a Paycheck Protection Program increase by unanimous consent on Thursday.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump said the US has made tremendous progress on therapeutics, and that the administration wants to try to be able to lift restrictions on April 30th. NEC Director Kudlow said that the administration is looking to reopen the economy as soon as health experts give the green light.</p><h2><strong>APAC</strong></h2><p><strong>JAPAN: </strong>PM Abe declared a State of Emergency in Tokyo, Osaka, alongside five other prefectures for one month; additionally, Japanese government has approved the JPY 108.2trl emergency economic stimulus package with JPY 39.5trln spending, as expected.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>ECB</strong> announced a package of temporary (but unprecedented) collateral easing measures to mitigate the tightening of financial conditions across the Euro area, and support credit to the economy. Crucially, the measures included the acceptance of Greek government bonds as collateral. Further, the ECB has eased the conditions for the use of credit claims as collateral and has adopted a general reduction of collateral valuation haircuts. The central bank said it will assess further measures to temporarily mitigate the effect on counterparties’ collateral availability from rating downgrades.</p><p><strong>RBA:</strong> The central bank left all policy settings unchanged (rates at 0.25% and reaffirmed the 3-year yield target at 0.25%), and pledged that if conditions continue to improve, it is likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds will be required. But the RBA also stated that it will do what is necessary to achieve its 3-year yield target of 0.25%, and that target is expected to remain in place until progress has been made on the labour market and inflation.</p><p><strong>FED: </strong>FOMC Meeting Minutes to be released at 1400 ET/1900 BST on 8th April 2020. On the 3rd March, the Fed cut rates by 50bps in an emergency move. And then on 15th March weekend meeting, the Fed took further aggressive steps, slashing rates by 100bps to 0.25% in its second inter-meeting rate move; it also committed to at least USD 700bln of QE, eased regulatory pressure on banks to free up capital, and announced dollar swap lines with other central banks. The timing of both announcements and the scope of the measures was a surprise -- in effect, it was the Fed’s ‘whatever it takes’ commitment to ensure the smooth functioning of markets amid the virus fallout. NOTE: It is not clear whether the release of the minutes will cover both meetings or just the latter; it is also unclear that if the minutes do cover both meetings, whether the release will be in two separate documents, or one aggregated one. Analysts at Nomura, however, have stated that the minutes will cover actions taken at both meetings. Since then, it has flooded the market with liquidity, resulting in the premium for dollars easing. Its balance sheet has ballooned to by USD 1.5trln to a new record high USD 5.86trln, and it has seen wide take-up of its liquidity facilities from banks and other central banks. The meeting minutes are unlikely to contain anything to spook markets, given that it has rolled out measures to assuage market concerns, and will likely reiterate its pledge to support the financial system. Analysts think the discussions will likely show most participants backing the use of the Fed’s toolkit aggressively, as COVID-19 outbreak began weighing on activity. The minutes may, however, feel stale. Since the 15th March meeting, the Fed has announced other measures (boosted QE and MBS purchases on 23/Mar, expanded repo for foreign central banks on 31/Mar, and also announced six further facilities, including the commercial paper facility). Discussions around these themes will likely appear in the next meeting minutes for the 28-29th April meeting, analysts believe. NOTE: Fed Chair Powell will be delivering remarks via weblink on Thursday, and will likely emphasise the themes within the minutes.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLES USD 2.45 LOWER AT USD 23.63/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 1.18 LOWER AT USD 31.87/BBL</strong></p><p>Front-month crude futures reversed earlier tentative gains as participants gear up for Thursday’s OPEC+ (plus) meeting. OPEC delegate reports suggest that Saudi and Russia are coming closer to an output deal; however, Russian press reports have subsequently pushed back on this notion, stating all will be decided at Thursday’s OPEC call. Russian press reported that the group could cut for three-months beginning in May, which resulted in some downside in crude futures, potentially as the market could be after a longer deal, and something more immediate. Meanwhile, as OPEC+ calls on other global producer to contribute to the cuts, US President Trump said that nobody has asked him to reduce US output, and he would decide when or if OPEC asks, adding that US producers had cut automatically as a reaction to the market. Note, OPEC sources have doubled-down on the demand, saying the volume of reductions is dependent on the amount proposed by the US, Canada and Brazil. Meanwhile, the price rout continues to be felt across the US, where major Exxon Mobil (XOM) cut its 2020 capex by 30%, saying the largest share of reductions will come from the Permian Basin.</p><p><strong>SPR: </strong>A Bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced a bill providing USD 3bln to purchase oil to fill the SPR, which has a spare capacity of 77mln barrels. The previous plan to fill the SPR was dropped as there was a lack of funding in the recent stimulus bill. However, since then the Department of Energy announced it would lease an initial 30mln space in the SPR to oil firms, while noting it intends to make an additional 47mln barrels available to lease later on, which would fill the 77mln bbls of spare capacity. The move comes amid a lack of storage space after the price of oil collapsed. The latest issue is reportedly with Marathon Petroleum (MPC), who are to reduce production by 25% at its 585k BPD Galveston Bay refinery amid a lack of storage, according to sources.</p><p><strong>CRUDE INVENTORIES:</strong> Looking ahead, the weekly US energy inventories draw attention with the private data release aftermarket on Tuesday; current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks building by 9.3mln, distillate building by 1.4mln and gasoline stocks seen building 4.3mln.</p><p><strong>EIA STEO:</strong> Cuts its 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 5.6mln BPD to 5.23mln BPD, raised 2021 forecast by 4.68mln BPD to 6.41mln BPD. Cut its 2020 US crude output by 470k BPD (prev. +760k BPD) to 11.76mln BPD, cut its 2021 output forecast by 730k BPD (prev. -330k BPD) to 11.03mln BPD.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 16 TICKS LOWER AT 137-29</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve continued to bear-steepen on Tuesday, as the cocktail of an extended risk rally, further issuance (both government and corporates) and scaled-back Fed bond buying weighed. The selling began at the tail-end of the APAC session, as stock futures gained traction heading into the European day. The steepener was further supported by comments from NEC Director Kudlow, who said the Treasury was aiming to reopen the 20-year bond amid the virus outbreak – Treasury Sec. Mnuchin has made similar comments in the past. Germany announcing plans for a new 15-year bond syndication, which pressured EGBs, lending an offer across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Fed continues to remove the stabilisers, purchasing a reduced clip of USD 50bln for a second day this week, although bid/ask spreads remain tight with decent volume in the futures, indicative of healthy market depth, as opposed to the lack of such back in March when the Fed stepped in. Duration was hit further by concession ahead of the 10-year auction reopening, where the Treasury sold USD 25bln, tailing by 0.7bps, marking the lowest ever high rate on a 10-year auction; the auction otherwise printed results similar to the six-auction averages, covered 2.43x and dealers taking 27.6%. Bidders in the Treasury complex were also dissuaded as the corporate issuance bonanza continued, with nine investment grade issuers on Tuesday (versus eleven on Monday), and even a few high-yield deals coming to the market; Qatar was out with a three-part USD 10bln issue, only widened the supply for participants to digest.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.16% at 2659, NDX -0.40% at 8049, DJIA -0.12% at 22654.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Materials +2.42%, Energy +2%, Consumer Discretionary +1.2%, Real Estate +0.1%, Industrials -0.2%, Health Care -0.9%, IT -1.05%, Communication Svs. -1.15%, Consumer Staples -1.2%, Utilities -1.2%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing (BA) announced it is to temporarily suspend its 787 operations at the South Carolina facility. Exxon Mobil (XOM) cut its 2020 CapEx by 30% and OpEx by 15%, noting the largest share of CapEx reductions will be in the Permian Basin. XOM maintained its long-term outlook. 3M (MMM) and the Trump administration resolved its dispute, while MMM is to import 166.5mln respirators over three months. Kraft Heinz (KHC) expects Q1 net sales growth of 3%, above analyst expectations for a sales decline. AT&amp;T (T) will continue to pay quarterly dividends and it has entered a new USD 5.5bln term loan agreement with banks. Stocks that have been heavily hit of late due to COVID saw a decent rally on Tuesday; travel names were bid, with cruise operators (CCL, NCLH, RCL) up ~20% while Airlines (AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV) were up 10-15% in the morning. Note, the opposite was seen with some of the winners from COVID-19 fallout, which endured some losses; Slack (WORK), Zoom (ZM) and DocuSign (DOCU) in negative territory. Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Infineon (IFX GY, IFNNY) received antitrust clearance in China, expects deal to be completed April 16th. Abercrombie and Fitch (ANF) and Ralph Laruen (RL) furlough in store workers. Activision (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) were rated as new overweight and new equal weight, respectively, at Wells Fargo. Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX regulatory test flight has reportedly been delayed to May, according to AFP citing sources. iQIYI (IQ) was named a new short at Muddy Waters, who after working with Wolfpack Research believes the co. is a fraud. Note, Baidu (BIDU) own a hefty stake in the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The dollar was down amid risk on conditions; risk sensitive FX (AUD, NZD, CAD, GBP all firmer) and EMFX was buoyed. The dollar selling saw DXY fall back beneath the 100.0 handle, to lows of 99.75. ING said USD funding fears may also be declining further as the IMF is apparently working on a repo facility to assist smaller economies with USD liquidity issues.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Was a beneficiary of an improved risk backdrop, while UK PM Johnson’s condition is stable, adding some support. Analysts at SocGen note the GBPUSD 200 dma at 1.2660-1.2720 as likely to be the next level of resistance if the bounce were to continue from the lows, if not a near term support would be 1.1950.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency was firmer today and briefly crossed 1.09 to the upside although now resides around the psychological level as participants await an update from the Eurogroup on its coordinated response to tackle the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>JPY, XAU:</strong> As expected Japanese PM Abe declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, as was hinted at yesterday. Abe also approved the JPY 108.2trln emergency economic stimulus package with JPY 39.5trln spending as expected. Despite the risk on feel today, USDJPY traded lower as dollar saw outflows as dollar scarcity normalises. USDJPY traded around the 109.00 figure. JPMorgan’s analysts stated that it has “reduced the vast majority of its USDJPY shorts yesterday as we feel that the idiosyncratic local dynamics are not playing out as we have expected,” and adds, that it remains on the side line for now looking to trade more opportunistically, highlighting the first support at 108.70/80 with 108.10/20 below that, while 109.25/35 remains resistance ahead of 110.00/10. Meanwhile, gold traded in line with risk appetite falling to lows of 1,643 from highs of 1,671 after solid gains yesterday despite signs supply shortages may ease in the coming weeks in Switzerland and the risk rally.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD:</strong> The Aussie dollar rose in wake of the RBA announcement. Although the central bank left all policy settings unchanged, it pledged that if conditions continue to improve, it is likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds will be required. But the RBA also stated that it will do what is necessary to achieve its 3-year yield target of 0.25%, and that target is expected to remain in place until progress has been made on the labour market and inflation. The Aussie also benefitted from an improved risk appetite which helped cyclical currencies perform well in general, although AUD outperformed and briefly crossed 0.6200 against the buck, a level it resides around heading into ASIA-PAC trade. The kiwi benefitted from the positive risk tone today albeit not to the same extent as the Aussie, perhaps capped by dismal confidence data which was -70% from a prior -20%.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie was another cyclical to benefit from risk appetite (albeit less so than GBP, AUD and NZD as crude prices were subdued ahead of Thursday’s OPEC+ call). Scotiabank said the market finds itself softer and edging below the base of its recent consolidation/21-day MA at 1.4137 (now immediate resistance) and added that it looks for a retest of the low 1.39s in the near-term.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> The dollar weakness and improved risk appetite see EM’s perform well, particularly the MXN and ZAR. Mexico inflation data (Mar.) did little to impact the Peso; core inflation ticked down slightly in line with expectations while 12-month inflation ticked down to 3.25% from 3.7% while headline inflation deflated slightly.</p>",

The dollar selling saw DXY fall back beneath the 100.0 handle, to lows of 99.75. ING said USD funding fears may also be declining further as the IMF is apparently working on a repo facility to assist smaller economies with USD liquidity issues.</li><li><strong>GBP:</strong> Was a beneficiary of an improved risk backdrop, while UK PM Johnson’s condition is stable, adding some support. Analysts at SocGen note the GBPUSD 200 dma at 1.2660-1.2720 as likely to be the next level of resistance if the bounce were to continue from the lows, if not a near term support would be 1.1950.</li><li><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency was firmer today and briefly crossed 1.09 to the upside although now resides around the psychological level as participants await an update from the Eurogroup on its coordinated response to tackle the coronavirus.</li><li><strong>JPY, XAU:</strong> As expected Japanese PM Abe declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, as was hinted at yesterday. Abe also approved the JPY 108.2trln emergency economic stimulus package with JPY 39.5trln spending as expected. Despite the risk on feel today, USDJPY traded lower as dollar saw outflows as dollar scarcity normalises. USDJPY traded around the 109.00 figure. JPMorgan’s analysts stated that it has “reduced the vast majority of its USDJPY shorts yesterday as we feel that the idiosyncratic local dynamics are not playing out as we have expected,” and adds, that it remains on the side line for now looking to trade more opportunistically, highlighting the first support at 108.70/80 with 108.10/20 below that, while 109.25/35 remains resistance ahead of 110.00/10. Meanwhile, gold traded in line with risk appetite falling to lows of 1,643 from highs of 1,671 after solid gains yesterday despite signs supply shortages may ease in the coming weeks in Switzerland and the risk rally.</li><li><strong>AUD, NZD:</strong> The Aussie dollar rose in wake of the RBA announcement. Although the central bank left all policy settings unchanged, it pledged that if conditions continue to improve, it is likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds will be required. But the RBA also stated that it will do what is necessary to achieve its 3-year yield target of 0.25%, and that target is expected to remain in place until progress has been made on the labour market and inflation. The Aussie also benefitted from an improved risk appetite which helped cyclical currencies perform well in general, although AUD outperformed and briefly crossed 0.6200 against the buck, a level it resides around heading into ASIA-PAC trade. The kiwi benefitted from the positive risk tone today albeit not to the same extent as the Aussie, perhaps capped by dismal confidence data which was -70% from a prior -20%.</li><li><strong>CAD:</strong> The loonie was another cyclical to benefit from risk appetite (albeit less so than GBP, AUD and NZD as crude prices were subdued ahead of Thursday’s OPEC+ call). Scotiabank said the market finds itself softer and edging below the base of its recent consolidation/21-day MA at 1.4137 (now immediate resistance), and added that it looks for a retest of the low 1.39s in the near-term.</li><li><strong>EMFX:</strong> The dollar weakness and improved risk appetite see EM’s perform well, particularly the MXN and ZAR. Mexico inflation data (Mar.) did little to impact the Peso; core inflation ticked down slightly in line with expectations while 12-month inflation ticked down to 3.25% from 3.7% while headline inflation actually deflated slightly.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The Treasury curve continued to bear-steepen on Tuesday, as the cocktail of an extended risk rally, further issuance (both government and corporates) and scaled-back Fed bond buying weighed. The selling began at the tail-end of the APAC session, as stock futures gained traction heading into the European day. The steepener was further supported by comments from NEC Director Kudlow, who said the Treasury was aiming to reopen the 20-year bond amid the virus outbreak – Treasury Sec. Mnuchin has made similar comments in the past. Germany announcing plans for a new 15-year bond syndication, which pressured EGBs, lending an offer across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Fed continues to remove the stabilizers, purchasing a reduced clip of USD 50bln for a second day this week, although bid/ask spreads remain tight with decent volume in the futures, indicative of healthy market depth, as opposed to the lack of such back in March when the Fed stepped in. Duration was hit further by concession ahead of the 10-year auction reopening, where the Treasury sold USD 25bln, tailing by 0.7bps, marking the lowest ever high rate on a 10-year auction; the auction otherwise printed results similar to the six-auction averages, covered 2.43x and dealers taking 27.6%. Bidders in the Treasury complex were also dissuaded as the corporate issuance bonanza continued, with nine investment grade issuers on Tuesday (versus eleven on Monday), and even a few high-yield deals coming to the market; Qatar was out with a three-part USD 10bln issue, only widened the supply for participants to digest.</p>",

OPEC delegate reports suggest that Saudi and Russia are coming closer to an output deal; however, Russian press reports have subsequently pushed back on this notion, stating all will be decided at Thursday’s OPEC call. Russian press reported that the group could cut for three-months beginning in May, which resulted in some downside in crude futures, potentially as the market could be after a longer deal, and something more immediate. Meanwhile, as OPEC+ calls on other global producer to contribute to the cuts, US President Trump said that nobody has asked him to reduce US output, and he would decide when or if OPEC asks, adding that US producers had cut automatically as a reaction to the market. Note, OPEC sources have doubled-down on the demand, saying the volume of reductions is dependent on the amount proposed by the US, Canada and Brazil. Meanwhile, the price rout continues to be felt across the US, where major Exxon Mobil (XOM) cut its 2020 capex by 30%, saying the largest share of reductions will come from the Permian Basin. Looking ahead, the weekly US energy inventories draw attention with the private data release aftermarket on Tuesday; current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks building by 9.3mln, distillate building by 1.4mln and gasoline stocks seen building 4.3mln.</li><li><strong>SPR: </strong>A Bipartisan group of US lawmakers have introduced a bill providing USD 3bln to purchase oil to fill the SPR, which has a spare capacity of 77mln barrels. The previous plan to fill the SPR was dropped as there was a lack of funding in the recent stimulus bill. However, since then the Department of Energy announced it would lease an initial 30mln space in the SPR to oil firms, while noting it intends to make an additional 47mln barrels available to lease later on, which would fill the 77mln bbls of spare capacity. The move comes amid a lack of storage space after the price of oil collapsed. The latest issue is reportedly with Marathon Petroleum (MPC), who are to reduce production by 25% at its 585k BPD Galveston Bay refinery amid a lack of storage, according to sources.</li><li><strong>CRUDE INVENTORIES:</strong> Looking ahead, the weekly US energy inventories draw attention with the private data release aftermarket on Tuesday; current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks building by 9.3mln, distillate building by 1.4mln and gasoline stocks seen building 4.3mln.</li><li><strong>EIA STEO:</strong> Cuts its 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 5.6mln BPD to 5.23mln BPD, raised 2021 forecast by 4.68mln BPD to 6.41mln BPD.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Although it is still way too early to declare victory or even a definitive breakthrough in the battle against the global coronavirus pandemic, the mood remains optimistic and certainly less gloomy than it was before the weekend when the daily rate of cases and fatalities in some places was rising exponentially. Indeed, stocks and commodities continue to rebound, with oil also simmering on the prospect of a positive end to the Saudi-Russia spat over crude prices and market share by the end of the week if not Thursday. Hence, high risk/beta/cyclical currencies and assets are maintaining Monday’s recovery momentum to the detriment of safe havens, while the Dollar is also losing out as demand for funding and liquidity continue to normalise. In response, the <strong>DXY </strong>relinquished 100.000+ status and probed below its month end high (99.948) towards the base of a 100.790-99.754 band before regaining some poise.</p><p><strong>AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Off best levels as its US counterpart attempts to find a base, but Aud/Usd is near the apex of wide 0.6207-0.6077 parameters in wake of the RBA standing pat on rates and noting that QE can be tapered when the time is right.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The Euro has not been able to extend on gains above the 1.0900 handle vs the Buck, but did see some support from the usual fix-related demand vs the Pound around 4 pm London time that supplemented traction from rising Eurozone yields and spread convergence to US Treasuries and UK Gilts.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/CAD/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>Also retaining their advantage over the Greenback, but down from earlier peaks as broad risk appetite wanes somewhat, with Nzd/Usd back below 0.6000, Usd/Chf bouncing from a brief sub-0.9700 foray, Usd/Cad revisiting 1.4000 vs 1.3945 as oil wavers and Canada’s Ivey PMIs provide even more evidence of the fallout from nCoV. Meanwhile, Cable is trying to consolidate above 1.2300 after the aforementioned Eur/Gbp cross flows that undermined Sterling, but with some positivity emanating from latest reports on the condition of UK PM Johnson. Elsewhere, the Yen is still anchored around 109.00 after Tokyo and 6 other Japanese prefectures entered states of emergency and the Government announced record JGB issuance to fund counter-virus measures.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Another good day at the office for the Scandinavian Kronas and EM currencies, with even the beleaguered Huf getting some respite from pseudo NBH tightening via a ramp up in overnight and 1-week collateralised funding rates to 1.85% from 0.9%.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>MACRO</strong>: The equity party continued through the night as Asian bourses carried on from Monday’s Wall Street gains – which saw SPX rise by ~7% - and continues to support futures in European trade. The Treasury curve continues to bear-steepen, 2s +2bps, while 7s, 10s, and 30s all +5bps – ahead of the 10-year Treasury auction. Crude is trading slightly firmer ahead of Thursday’s OPEC+ meeting, albeit off highs after TASS sources suggested a three-month OPEC+ cut starting in May. Meanwhile, Gold trades subdued, while the DXY has moved lower beneath the 100 figure.</li><li><strong>SECTOR THEMES</strong>: In Europe, the coronavirus-hit names are seeing outperformance as stocks continue a heavy bounce following on from yesterday’s gains, spurred by signs that coronavirus cases could be slowing somewhat. In the US, travel names are bid, with cruise operators (CCL, NCLH, RCL) +20%, while Airlines (AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV) are up 10-15%. Attention on energy is high ahead of OPEC’s emergency meeting on Thursday, with President Trump noting he has not agreed to cut oil production as part of the OPEC+ deal and nor has anybody asked him to, adding US companies have already been cutting output given the current situation. However, the latest reports continue to state production cuts are needed from oil-producing nations, including the US. All sectors open in the green with defensives (XLP, XLU, XLV) at the bottom of the pack although still firmer by 1-2%; Technology also a laggard. Energy and financials lead the gains with the former benefitting from firmer yields.</li><li><strong>US EQUITY STORIES</strong>: Boeing (BA) announced it is to temporarily suspend its 787 operations at the South Carolina facility. Exxon Mobil (XOM) cut its 2020 CapEx by 30% and OpEx by 15%, noting the largest share of CapEx reductions will be in the Permian Basin. XOM maintained its long-term outlook. 3M (MMM) and the Trump administration resolved its dispute, while MMM is to import 166.5mln respirators over three months. Kraft Heinz (KHC) expects Q1 net sales growth of 3%, above analyst expectations for a sales decline. AT&amp;T (T) will continue to pay quarterly dividends and it has entered a new USD 5.5bln term loan agreement with banks. Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Infineon (IFX GY, IFNNY) received antitrust clearance in China, expects deal to be completed April 16th. Abercrombie and Fitch (ANF) and Ralph Laruen (RL) furlough in store workers. Activision (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) were rated as new overweight and new equal weight, respectively, at Wells Fargo.</li><li><strong>ENERGY</strong>: Front-month oil futures are, on a relative to recent session basis, making tentative gains with both Brent and WTI up by less than a buck. The moves are likely some paring of the sell-off on Monday, in addition to positioning ahead of the much anticipated, and delayed, OPEC+ (plus) meeting on Thursday. Delegate reports intimate that Saudi and Russia are coming closer to an output deal; however, Russian press reports have subsequently pushed back on this stating all will be decided at Thursday’s meeting. Separates TASS sources have recently suggested the group could cut for three months starting in May, which saw some downside in crude futures in recent trade. Meanwhile, as OPEC+ calls publicly on North American commitments, US President Trump said that nobody has asked him to cut US output and that he will decide if OPEC asks the US to cut, while he added US producers had cut automatically as a reaction to the market; note, OPEC sources have doubled-down, saying the volume of reductions is dependent on the amount proposed by the US, Canada and Brazil.</li><li><strong>TECHNICALS</strong>: BofA notes yesterday’s rally in the SPX brought it to a 38.2% retracement of the Feb-March decline (cash closed at ~2660). The bank notes the recent strength keeps the focus on a continued tactical bounce with focus next at 2792 (50% retracement) and 2881 (100-week MA), whereas it provides tactical supports at 2571/2522 (Monday’s upside gap), and below that at 2450, 2344/2300.</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, the Greenback has extended declines broadly with the DXY losing grasp of 100.00 and breaching support via its end of March/Q1 peak at 99.948 on the way to 99.765. Several Usd/majors are flirting with or beyond big figures, like 1.0900, 1.4000 and 0.9700 for the Eur, Cad and Chf respectively.

        "content": "<ul><li>On the 3rd March, the Fed cut rates by 50bps in an emergency move. And then on 15th March weekend meeting, the Fed took further aggressive steps, slashing rates by 100bps to 0.25% in its second inter-meeting rate move; it also committed to at least USD 700bln of QE, eased regulatory pressure on banks to free up capital, and announced dollar swap lines with other central banks.</li><li>The timing of the both announcements and the scope of the measures was a surprise -- in effect, it was the Fed's 'whatever it takes' commitment to ensure the smooth functioning of markets amid the virus fallout.</li><li>NOTE: It is not clear whether the release of the minutes will cover both meetings, or just the latter; it is also unclear that if the minutes do cover both meetings, whether the release will be in two separate documents, or one aggregated one. Analysts at Nomura, however, have stated that the minutes will cover actions taken at both meetings.</li><li>Since then, it has flooded the market with liquidity, resulting in the premium for dollars easing. Its balance sheet has ballooned to by USD 1.5trln to a new record high USD 5.86trln, and it has seen wide take-up of its liquidity facilities from banks and other central banks.</li><li>The meeting minutes are unlikely to contain anything to spook markets, given that it has rolled-out measures to assuage market concerns, and will likely reiterate its pledge to support the financial system. Analysts think the discussions will likely show a most participants backing the use of the Fed's toolkit aggressively, as COVID-19 outbreak began weighing on activity.</li><li>The minutes may, however, feel stale. Since the 15th March meeting, the Fed has announced other measures (boosted QE and MBS purchases on 23/Mar, expanded repo for foreign central banks on 31/Mar, and also announced six further facilities, including the commercial paper facility). Discussions around these themes will likely appear in the next meeting minutes for the 28-29th April meeting, analysts believe.</li><li>NOTE: Fed Chair Powell will be delivering remarks via weblink on Thursday, and will likely emphasise the themes within the minutes.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

ASX 200 (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+2.0%)</strong> were both boosted and surged over 2% shortly after the open although gains in Australia then waned amid losses in the healthcare sector and cautiousness heading into the RBA decision, while the Japanese benchmark briefly broke above the 19000 level supported by better than expected Housing Spending data and plans for a JPY 108tln package but later gave back a majority of gains heading into the state of emergency declaration. <strong>Hang Seng (+2.1%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+2.1%) </strong>were also positive with outperformance seen in the mainland as it plays catch up on return from the extended weekend and took its first opportunity to react to the PBoC’s 100bps targeted RRR cut announcement. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as prices bounced back from support around the 152.00 level and with the BoJ offering to buy JPY 150bln of corporate bonds, although upside was also capped due to the mostly upbeat risk tone and following weaker results at the 30yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European stocks post another straight session of gains in early trade [Euro Stoxx 50 +3.5%], </strong>following a mostly positive APAC handover, as participants see optimism on the COVID-19 containments front and heading into the Eurogroup meeting on Finance Ministers, in which three stimulus measures are expected to be discussed (Primer available here). Broad-based gains are seen across the major European bourses, whilst Italy’s FTSE MIB (+5.2%) outperforms in the periphery, with the index’s large financial sector benefitting from price action in the fixed income complex – and as the region feels tailwinds from the ECB allocating a lion’s share of its bond-buying (35%) to Italian debt in March. Sectors are all in positive territory and reflect a “risk-on” mood, with cyclicals outpacing defensives, Financials benefit from the high-yield environment. The theme of today is a sharp rebound across stocks and sectors that have been decimated on the COVID-19 outbreak. The sector breakdown sees Travel &amp; Leisure notably outperforming, whilst Auto names follow a close second. Thus, easyJet (+18.9%), Carnival (+18.8%) among the top gainers in the region, whilst aircraft engine makers Rolls Royce (+14.0%) and Safran (+9.0%) also see gains in excess of 10%, having recently been hit on the prospects of declining aircraft productions on lower demand. On the flip side, Healthcare names are softer given the sector’s relative buoyancy during the demise of riskier stocks – AstraZeneca (-1.8%), Novo Nordisk (-1.5%).</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY -</strong> The Dollar is softer across the board amidst another upturn in sentiment on the hope that tentative signs of COVID-19 curve flattening do not prove short-lived and completely dashed by Tuesday’s global updates on the state of the virus. The DXY has retreated a bit further from recent recovery highs just shy of 101.000 as a result and is now hovering a fraction above 100.000 with little in the way of technical support before March 31’s high (99.948) to supplement the obvious psychological props.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD -</strong> The Aussie is outperforming after the RBA maintained rates overnight and offered some exit policy guidance, albeit somewhat premature at this still very formative stage. However, bolstered by the aforementioned less downbeat risk tone Aud/Usd has built on advances through 0.6150 and got to within a whisker of 0.6200 before running out of momentum, while Aud/Nzd has crossed 1.0300 as the Kiwi failed to sustain 0.6000+ status in wake of NZIER sentiment sinking in Q1 and ahead of latest bi-weekly GDT auction results.</p><p><strong>NOK/GBP/EUR -</strong> The Norwegian Crown looks all set to extend its bull run against the backdrop of firm oil prices in the run up to Thursday’s OPEC+ meeting that Russia will attend and is reportedly nearing an agreement with Saudi Arabia about how many bpd to cut in order to stabilise the cost of crude. Eur/Nok has been down to circa 11.1060 even though the single currency has unwound declines vs the Buck at 1.0880 from sub-1.0800. Elsewhere, the Pound has also regrouped after depreciation on news of UK PM Johnson’s transfer to intensive care pushed Cable down to around 1.2165, but hit resistance into 1.2350 and is still below 0.8800 in Euro cross terms.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY -</strong> The Franc is back near up the top of a 0.9725-95 or so range after SNB reserves data showing a fall in stark contrast to weekly Swiss sight deposits supporting the notion that intervention has picked up markedly of late, with little reaction to rises in jobless rates that are likely to pale in comparison to increases in unemployment to come. Similarly, the Loonie has pared post-BoC business outlook survey losses with the aid of buoyancy in oil to retest 1.4000 ahead of Canada’s Ivey PMI and awaiting the nation’s contribution to the joint crude output cut, assuming there is consensus. Meanwhile, the Yen has also profited at the Greenback’s expense, though to a lesser extent as a renowned safe-haven and with Japan confirming 7 prefectures in an official state of emergency, including Tokyo. Usd/Jpy is currently pivoting 109.00, but from a chart perspective still on an upward trajectory while above the 200 DMA (108.34) and not likely to stir hefty option expiry interest from 108.00 to 108.50 rolling off on Wednesday unless things change quite dramatically in the next 24 hours of course.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Widespread rebounds vs the Dollar, and with the Rand unwinding more of its significant underperformance through 18.3000 vs 19.3500 at the other extreme due to consolidation and short covering more than anything fundamental, aside from the broad improvement in risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>RBA kept rates on hold at 0.25% as expected and the board reaffirmed the 3yr yield target at 0.25% which is expected to remain in place until progress is being made towards goals of full employment and inflation. RBA added the board is committed to doing what it can to support jobs, incomes and businesses as Australia deals with the coronavirus but noted that once the virus is contained, a recovery in the global economy is expected. Furthermore, it stated that if conditions continue to improve, it is likely that smaller less frequent purchases of government bonds will be needed</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(Feb) 4361mln vs. Exp. 3650mln (Prev. 5210mln). (Newswires) Australian Exports (Feb) M/M -5% (Prev. -3.0%) Australian Imports (Feb) M/M -4% (Prev. -3.0%)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It seems that bearish momentum rather than anything new or more negative has prompted the latest downturn in 10 year German debt as another notable chart support in the guise of the 100 DMA (171.05) has been breached on the way down to a fresh 170.91 intraday Eurex low. Indeed, linker supply was absorbed well enough, albeit demand mixed vs previous sales and average yields less negative, while the charge in EU stocks has abated somewhat. Moreover, <strong>Gilts</strong> are still holding above 136.00 after a marginally closer look, at 136.03 before an even bigger bounce to 136.30 and 10 year T-notes are a fraction off their overnight session base ahead of JOLTS and Usd25 bn supply in that tenor.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front-month futures have resumed their rise in the run-up to a “make or break” OPEC+ meeting, with members outside the group urged to join in on a potential coordinated move. In terms of where we stand, the OPEC+ meeting is due to take place at on Thursday at 1500BST, with a presser to follow (all times tentative) – OPEC+ press conferences tend to be delayed. Reports also noted that G20 ministers to convene an extraordinary meeting on Friday at 1300BST, to discuss the energy market turmoil, according to reports. Energy Intel notes of a meeting on Friday in which members outside OPEC+ will be asked pledge additional reductions, “over and above 10mln BPD”. OPEC sources stated that OPEC+ group is reportedly likely to agree to oil production cuts on Thursday although it is contingent upon the US joining in with the production cuts, according to three OPEC+ sources. That said, earlier reports intimated OPEC+ still can't reach a preliminary consensus on individual volumes of oil production cuts, particularly the largest producers, according to three delegations cited by TASS. As a reminder, under one of the touted OPEC+ scenarios: 10mln BPD cuts will include North America; Saudi would cut a minimum of 3mln BPD; Russia 1.5mln BPD; US, Canada, and Brazil almost 2mln BPD (Texas at least 500k BPD) according to sources cited by WSJ’s Summer Said. Furthermore, today will see the release of the first monthly oil report, the EIA STEO, which will depict a clear impact of the coronavirus outbreak – thus eyes will be on the magnitude of further demand downgrades and revisions lower to US crude output as a function of lower oil prices. That being said, the release may be overshadowed by the tentative OPEC+ congregation later in the week, which will shift the dynamic in the oil market. In terms of data, the weekly API releases at the usual time, with forecasts for a headline build of around 9mln barrels over the last week. WTI May’20 hovers around USD 27/bbl (vs. low of USD 26.29/bbl, and high USD 27.19), whilst its Brent counterpart re-eyes USD 34/bbl to the upside having briefly breached the level during late APAC trade. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> fails to benefit from the weaker Buck, as the rise in equities proves the yellow metal to be less attractive, with prices back below 1650/oz after rising to a whisker away from 1680/oz in the overnight session. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices continue to mimic the rise in stocks, with the red metal piggybacking overall risk appetite and breaking out of its recent range (USD 2-2.25lb), with red metal prices around USD 2.3/lb at the time of writing.</p><p><strong>US President Trump commented that nobody has asked him to cut US oil output and that he will decide if OPEC asks US to cut production, while he added US producers have cut automatically as a reaction to the market.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Delegate reports intimate that Saudi and Russia are coming closer to an output deal</strong>; however, Russian<strong> press reports have subsequently pushed back on this</strong> stating all will be decided at Thursday’s meeting.

Broad-based gains are seen across the major European bourses, whilst Italy’s FTSE MIB (+5.2%) outperforms in the periphery, with the index’s large financial sector benefitting from price action in the fixed income complex – and as the region feels tailwinds from the ECB allocating a lion’s share of its bond-buying (35%) to Italian debt in March. Sectors are all in positive territory and reflect a “risk-on” mood, with cyclicals outpacing defensives, Financials benefit from the high-yield environment. The theme of today is a sharp rebound across stocks and sectors that have been decimated on the COVID-19 outbreak. The sector breakdown sees Travel &amp; Leisure notably outperforming, whilst Auto names follow a close second. Thus, easyJet (+18.9%), Carnival (+18.8%) among the top gainers in the region, whilst aircraft engine makers Rolls Royce (+14.0%) and Safran (+9.0%) also see gains in excess of 10%, having recently been hit on the prospects of declining aircraft productions on lower demand. On the flip side, Healthcare names are softer given the sector’s relative buoyancy during the demise of riskier stocks – AstraZeneca (-1.8%), Novo Nordisk (-1.5%).</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>DXY - The Dollar is softer across the board amidst another upturn in sentiment on the hope that tentative signs of COVID-19 curve flattening do not prove short-lived and completely dashed by Tuesday’s global updates on the state of the virus. The DXY has retreated a bit further from recent recovery highs just shy of 101.000 as a result and is now hovering a fraction above 100.000 with little in the way of technical support before March 31’s high (99.948) to supplement the obvious psychological props.</p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie is outperforming after the RBA maintained rates overnight and offered some exit policy guidance, albeit somewhat premature at this still very formative stage. However, bolstered by the aforementioned less downbeat risk tone Aud/Usd has built on advances through 0.6150 and got to within a whisker of 0.6200 before running out of momentum, while Aud/Nzd has crossed 1.0300 as the Kiwi failed to sustain 0.6000+ status in wake of NZIER sentiment sinking in Q1 and ahead of latest bi-weekly GDT auction results.</p><p>NOK/GBP/EUR - The Norwegian Crown looks all set to extend its bull run against the backdrop of firm oil prices in the run up to Thursday’s OPEC+ meeting that Russia will attend and is reportedly nearing an agreement with Saudi Arabia about how many bpd to cut in order to stabilise the cost of crude. Eur/Nok has been down to circa 11.1060 even though the single currency has unwound declines vs the Buck at 1.0880 from sub-1.0800. Elsewhere, the Pound has also regrouped after depreciation on news of UK PM Johnson’s transfer to intensive care pushed Cable down to around 1.2165, but hit resistance into 1.2350 and is still below 0.8800 in Euro cross terms.</p><p>CHF/CAD/JPY - The Franc is back near up the top of a 0.9725-95 or so range after SNB reserves data showing a fall in stark contrast to weekly Swiss sight deposits supporting the notion that intervention has picked up markedly of late, with little reaction to rises in jobless rates that are likely to pale in comparison to increases in unemployment to come. Similarly, the Loonie has pared post-BoC business outlook survey losses with the aid of buoyancy in oil to retest 1.4000 ahead of Canada’s Ivey PMI and awaiting the nation’s contribution to the joint crude output cut, assuming there is consensus. Meanwhile, the Yen has also profited at the Greenback’s expense, though to a lesser extent as a renowned safe-haven and with Japan confirming 7 prefectures in an official state of emergency, including Tokyo. Usd/Jpy is currently pivoting 109.00, but from a chart perspective still on an upward trajectory while above the 200 DMA (108.34) and not likely to stir hefty option expiry interest from 108.00 to 108.50 rolling off on Wednesday unless things change quite dramatically in the next 24 hours of course.</p><p>EM - Widespread rebounds vs the Dollar, and with the Rand unwinding more of its significant underperformance through 18.3000 vs 19.3500 at the other extreme due to consolidation and short covering more than anything fundamental, aside from the broad improvement in risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It seems that bearish momentum rather than anything new or more negative has prompted the latest downturn in 10 year <strong>German</strong> <strong>debt</strong> as another notable chart support in the guise of the 100 DMA (171.05) has been breached on the way down to a fresh 170.91 intraday Eurex low. Indeed, linker supply was absorbed well enough, albeit demand mixed vs previous sales and average yields less negative, while the charge in EU stocks has abated somewhat. Moreover, Gilts are still holding above 136.00 after a marginally closer look, at 136.03 before an even bigger bounce to 136.30 and 10 year <strong>T-notes</strong> are a fraction off their overnight session base ahead of JOLTS and Usd25 bn supply in that tenor.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures have resumed their rise in the run-up to a “make or break” OPEC+ meeting, with members outside the group urged to join in on a potential coordinated move. In terms of where we stand, the OPEC+ meeting is due to take place at on Thursday at 1500BST, with a presser to follow (all times tentative) – OPEC+ press conferences tend to be delayed. Reports also noted that G20 ministers to convene an extraordinary meeting on Friday at 1300BST, to discuss the energy market turmoil, according to reports. Energy Intel notes of a meeting on Friday in which members outside OPEC+ will be asked pledge additional reductions, “over and above 10mln BPD”. OPEC sources stated that OPEC+ group is reportedly likely to agree to oil production cuts on Thursday although it is contingent upon the US joining in with the production cuts, according to three OPEC+ sources. That said, earlier reports intimated OPEC+ still can't reach a preliminary consensus on individual volumes of oil production cuts, particularly the largest producers, according to three delegations cited by TASS. As a reminder, under one of the touted OPEC+ scenarios: 10mln BPD cuts will include North America; Saudi would cut a minimum of 3mln BPD; Russia 1.5mln BPD; US, Canada, and Brazil almost 2mln BPD (Texas at least 500k BPD) according to sources cited by WSJ’s Summer Said.

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar is softer across the board amidst another upturn in sentiment on the hope that tentative signs of COVID-19 curve flattening do not prove short-lived and completely dashed by Tuesday’s global updates on the state of the virus. The <strong>DXY </strong>has retreated a bit further from recent recovery highs just shy of 101.000 as a result and is now hovering a fraction above 100.000 with little in the way of technical support before March 31’s high (99.948) to supplement the obvious psychological props.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie is outperforming after the RBA maintained rates overnight and offered some exit policy guidance, albeit somewhat premature at this still very formative stage. However, bolstered by the aforementioned less downbeat risk tone Aud/Usd has built on advances through 0.6150 and got to within a whisker of 0.6200 before running out of momentum, while Aud/Nzd has crossed 1.0300 as the Kiwi failed to sustain 0.6000+ status in wake of NZIER sentiment sinking in Q1 and ahead of latest bi-weekly GDT auction results.</p><p><strong>NOK/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown looks all set to extend its bull run against the backdrop of firm oil prices in the run up to Thursday’s OPEC+ meeting that Russia will attend and is reportedly nearing an agreement with Saudi Arabia about how many bpd to cut in order to stabilise the cost of crude. Eur/Nok has been down to circa 11.1060 even though the single currency has unwound declines vs the Buck at 1.0880 from sub-1.0800. Elsewhere, the Pound has also regrouped after depreciation on news of UK PM Johnson’s transfer to intensive care pushed Cable down to around 1.2165, but hit resistance into 1.2350 and is still below 0.8800 in Euro cross terms.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc is back near up the top of a 0.9725-95 or so range after SNB reserves data showing a fall in stark contrast to weekly Swiss sight deposits supporting the notion that intervention has picked up markedly of late, with little reaction to rises in jobless rates that are likely to pale in comparison to increases in unemployment to come. Similarly, the Loonie has pared post-BoC business outlook survey losses with the aid of buoyancy in oil to retest 1.4000 ahead of Canada’s Ivey PMI and awaiting the nation’s contribution to the joint crude output cut, assuming there is consensus. Meanwhile, the Yen has also profited at the Greenback’s expense, though to a lesser extent as a renowned safe-haven and with Japan confirming 7 prefectures in an official state of emergency, including Tokyo. Usd/Jpy is currently pivoting 109.00, but from a chart perspective still on an upward trajectory while above the 200 DMA (108.34) and not likely to stir hefty option expiry interest from 108.00 to 108.50 rolling off on Wednesday unless things change quite dramatically in the next 24 hours of course.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Widespread rebounds vs the Dollar, and with the Rand unwinding more of its significant underperformance through 18.3000 vs 19.3500 at the other extreme due to consolidation and short covering more than anything fundamental, aside from the broad improvement in risk sentiment.</p>",

However, rebounds look increasingly tame and apart from a continuation of risk-on sentiment epitomised by the ongoing FTSE and broad global stock market recovery, UK bonds have another slug of issuance to make room for even though investor appetite for increased DMO supply has been relatively strong thus far. Moreover, today’s auction is duel tranche and totals Gbp4.5 bn 2023 and 2057 maturities. Back to Liffe, the Short Sterling strip is also off just worst levels between -0.5 to -2 tick parameters and not much changed after marginally softer than expected Halifax house prices.</p>",

The subdued greenback provided some respite for its major counterparts including EUR/USD which reclaimed the 1.0800 handle but with gains capped amid a cluster of nearby hourly moving average levels ranging up to the 50-hour MA at 1.0805. GBP/USD initially extended on the prior day’s underperformance on news that PM Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit after his conditions worsened where he was said to receive oxygen but was not on a ventilator, while selling was exacerbated on a brief break below the 1.2200 level before eventually recovering on the USD weakness. Elsewhere, USD/JPY saw a mild pullback from the recent risk-driven flows to slip back below the 109.00 handle and antipodeans traded higher due to their high beta properties and after a firmer PBoC fixing, while the RBA announcement to keep rates unchanged at 0.25% as expected eventually spurred some upside considering that money market rates were pricing in a near coin-flip between a cut and a hold, and as the central bank suggested it could reduce its QE operations if conditions improve.</p><p><strong>RBA kept rates on hold at 0.25% as expected and the board reaffirmed the 3yr yield target at 0.25% which is expected to remain in place until progress is being made towards goals of full employment and inflation. RBA added the board is committed to doing what it can to support jobs, incomes and businesses as Australia deals with the coronavirus but noted that once the virus is contained, a recovery in the global economy is expected. Furthermore, it stated that if conditions continue to improve, it is likely that smaller less frequent purchases of government bonds will be needed</strong>.

Nonetheless, prices have recovered off lows after finding support at the USD 26.00/bbl and amid the positive risk appetite, while there were also encouraging source reports that suggested Russia was ready to discuss very substantial oil output cuts.

The T-Note had been firming off of lows in early European trade amid tentative equity gains, although pared strength as the US session commenced and the equity rally gained momentum, on both sides of the pond. However, the curve steepening was tamed somewhat as investors anticipated the upsized USD 40bln 3-year Treasury issuance, which tailed by a chunky 1.2bps, covered&nbsp; 2.27x (less than the six-auction average of 2.47x), and saw dealers take 40.54% (more than the average 35.3%).&nbsp; Furthermore, the Fed’s support for Treasuries has pared further on Monday, and for the rest of the week, as it trimmed its daily purchases amount to USD 50bln per week, which also saw participants sell into the operations. All the while, corporate issuance started the week again on a strong note, seeing eleven IG issuers come to the dollar market and a small handful of SSAs (particularly Canadians), likely adding to the selling pressures. By settlement, 2s +5bps at 0.266%, 10s +8bps at 0.671%. T-note (M0) futures settled 23+ ticks lower at 138-13.</p><p><strong>Federal Reserve and US Treasury Dept. are reportedly preparing to launch a new programme to buy loans that firms make throughout its small business lending programme.</strong> (WSJ)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) were both boosted and surged over 2% shortly after the open although gains in Australia then waned amid losses in the healthcare sector and cautiousness heading into the RBA decision, while the Japanese benchmark briefly broke above the 19000 level supported by better than expected Housing Spending data and policymakers efforts after Japanese PM Abe declared plans for a JPY 108tln stimulus package. Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) are also positive with outperformance seen in the mainland as it plays catch up on return from the extended weekend and takes its first opportunity to react to the PBoC’s 100bps targeted RRR cut announcement.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer overnight as the heightened risk appetite dampens demand for safe-haven currencies including USD which had more than benefitted from the recent coronavirus turmoil and its reserve currency status. The subdued greenback provided some respite for its major counterparts including EUR/USD which reclaimed the 1.0800 handle but with gains capped amid a cluster of nearby hourly moving average levels ranging up to the 50-hour MA at 1.0805. GBP/USD initially extended on the prior day’s underperformance on news that PM Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit after his conditions worsened where he was said to receive oxygen but was not on a ventilator, while selling was exacerbated on a brief break below the 1.2200 level before eventually recovering on the USD weakness. Elsewhere, USD/JPY saw a mild pullback from the recent risk-driven flows to slip back below the 109.00 handle and antipodeans trade higher due to their high beta properties and after a firmer PBoC fixing, with attention now turning to the looming RBA policy announcement in which analysts expect no change in rates but money markets are pricing in a near coin-flip between a 25bps cut and a hold.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as prices bounce back from support around the 152.00 level and with the BoJ offering to buy JPY 150bln of corporate bonds, although upside is also capped due to the upbeat risk tone and ahead of a 30yr JGB auction later.</p>",
