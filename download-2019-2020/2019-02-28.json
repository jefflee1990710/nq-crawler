        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities down, dollar up, Treasuries down, crude mixed.<br />* REAR VIEW: US Q4 GDP slight beat; Kudlow, Mnuchin jawbone, but no trade timeline; Chicago PMI beats.<br />* AHEAD: Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI, German Unemployment Data, EZ Manufacturing PMI (Final) &amp; CPI (Flash), UK Manufacturing PMI, US Core PCE &amp; Retail Sales, US ISM Manufacturing PMI, Canadian GDP, Fed&rsquo;s Powell, Mester &amp; Bostic Speaking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China and the US seem to be moving further towards the signing of a trade deal. There were reports on Thursday that If China&#39;s President Xi accepts what his negotiators have put on paper, which an administration source sees as largely complete at around 140 pages, there will likely be a signing event at Mar-a-Lago at the end of March, where Trump and Xi are looking to meet, provided there are no hiccups. NEC Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC in early trade that talks were progressing, but avoided answering a question on when a trade deal would likely be signed. On USTR Lighthizer, Kudlow said he was instrumental on bringing trade talks back on track, and dismissed reports of a rift between Trump and Lighthizer &ndash; following concerns of growing differences between the trade hawk and the President &ndash; saying their relationship is very close. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin also refused to give details on the timeline for a deal, but said the deal will be very detailed with specific structural commitments, and it will be a &ldquo;real agreement&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US GDP: </strong>GDP grew by 2.6% in Q4, beating the expected 2.2% forecast but slowing from Q3&rsquo;s 3.4% reading, complementing the narrative of a cooling economy in 2019 as fiscal stimulus begins to fade. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics note, &ldquo;Growth overshot expectations because investment in IP rocketed at a 13.1% rate, nearly double the underlying trend pace. These numbers are volatile, and a much smaller gain is likely in Q1.&rdquo; The 70% weighted, consumption component of the all-encompassing growth measure rose by 2.8%, where falling tax cut stimulus was offset by supportive lower energy prices. &ldquo;The GDP deflator rose 1.8%, with the core PCE deflator up 1.7%; &hellip;bringing the core PCE numbers more closely into line with the core CPI.&rdquo; Going forward, Q1 may not be quite so rosy, &ldquo;Gas prices are no longer falling, the government shutdown likely caused at least some unrecovered hit to consumption, business capex is softening and global growth is weaker.&rdquo; Pantheon sees Q1 GDP of 1%-2% as growth reverts to a longer trend rate, down from a &ldquo;sugar high&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DEBT CEILING: </strong>The suspension of the US debt ceiling ends on 1 March, though there has not been any panic just yet, as markets are distracted by geopolitics, politics, and trade wars, while a slowing global growth backdrop and Brexit add to the risks. Commerzbank suggests that the debt ceiling is just not a pressing issue just yet: &quot;The US administration can continue to finance itself with the help of extraordinary measures until the summer,&quot; CBK Writes, &quot;as a result it may not be until the summer that budget and debt ceiling combined will be hotly debated in Congress again causing trouble for the dollar.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI: </strong>February&rsquo;s Chicago PMI index surged to 64.7, above both the expected 57.0 and January&rsquo;s drop to 56.7. Pantheon analysts comment, that following last month&rsquo;s big drop, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t expect quite such a big rebound this month, given the continued downward pressure on manufacturing globally.&rdquo; They go on to suggest that, although volatile, this should suggest tomorrow&rsquo;s ISM index dipping only slightly with the possibility of a rise; longer-term they remain more pessimistic, highlighting the headwinds from disappointing China data, including last night&rsquo;s PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Clarida (voter, neutral) reiterated the Fed&rsquo;s stance of data dependence and that it can be patient. On the outlook, Clarida sees 2019 growth as &#39;slower but solid&#39;, and inflation expectations in line with Fed&#39;s inflation goal. On the balance sheet, Clarida said no &quot;slam dunk&quot; decision has been made on the composition of securities to be held in the balance sheet and a decision will be made after the size is determined. Fed&#39;s Harker (non-voter, dovish) said that one hike in 2019 and one in 2020 is appropriate, adding that potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said the Fed should not be taking any action with rates through June and that rates are currently in the neutral range; saying that it will take some months to evaluate US growth deceleration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLES $0.28 HIGHER AT $57.22/BBL; BRENT (J9, EXPIRES) SETTLES DOWN $0.36 AT $66.03/BBL. </strong>Crude prices were mixed on Thursday as WTI made gains whilst its European counterpart traded lower; contracting the WTI/Brent Arb. Analysts at Citi note &ldquo;contract expirations in April Brent, March heating oil, and March RBOB gasoline will dictate a degree of book squaring that may entail more rotation between markets than an overall push higher or lower in today&rsquo;s trade.&rdquo; Elsewhere, early reports from JBC Energy suggest OPEC output fell 550k BPD to 30.39mln BPD in February and Nigerian Energy Minister Kachikwu said Nigeria complied with the OPEC+ cuts deal in February. Elsewhere the markets digested a range of macroeconomic data, including weak PMI data from China and an above expected Q4 GDP figure in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.3% at 2785, NDX -0.3% at 7098, DJI -0.3% at 25915. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -1.0%, Materials -1.2%, Industrials -0.3%, Cons Discretionary -0.6%, Cons Staples +0.4%, Healthcare -0.3%, Financials -0.3%, Tech -0.3%, Telecoms 0.0%, Utilities +0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Both Booking Holdings (BKNG) and HP Inc (HPQ) reported a miss on revenue estimates and lowered their guidance causing the stocks to tank on Thursday. Monster Beverage (MNST) reported a beat on top and bottom line estimates and announced a USD 500mln share repurchase programme causing the stock to surge. Nielsen Holdings (NLSN) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were top performers after strong earnings. Southwest Airlines (LUV) caught a mid-session bid on rumours Warren Buffet&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is considering a takeover offer. Celgene (CELG) nosedived on the day in the midst of Bristol-Myers (BMY) shareholders - Wellington and Starboard - expressing concern on Bristol acquiring Celgene; Bristol traded higher. L Brands (LB) and CenterPoint Energy (CNP) were underperformers following disappointing earnings reports. Square (SQ) nosedived on the open after beating Q4 revenue but lowering its revenue guidance, however it did pare back losses though the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 121-24. </strong>Yields were higher across the curve, lead by the belly; decent GDP data helped selling action, as well as a beat from the Chicago PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FX VOL, USD, CNY, CNH: </strong>Many desks have observed declining FX volatility of late, and the support it provides for FX carry trades. This seems to be supporting the USD for now, which has largely been patrolling a 96.000-97.000 range, despite many of those desks reiterating bearish thesis for the buck over the medium-term. SocGen expains the four factors that are dirving this environment: 1) the terminal fed funds rate is likely lower than the downward-revised estimates of the neutral rate suggest, 2) major central banks seem to have pivoted to wait-and-see mode, leaving no monpol inspiration for any FX position adjustments (even this week, Powell avoided giving any clues about which direction rates will next head), 3) the aggregated balance sheets at the Fed, ECB and BOJ are likely to be larger than many would have predicted a few months ago, and finally 4) China is being pressured to maintain yuan stability (even though some believe that a fundamental adjustment lower is exactly how the currency should be responding to incoming data, like the PMIs overnight).&nbsp; &quot;If world&rsquo;s most important currency (possibly) is set to be stable, then the FX market will be quiet for a while,&quot; SocGen writes, &quot;and carry hunters in FX will like owning the yuan, while bond investors will go on liking Chinese bonds.&quot; Looking ahead, SocGen believes that we&#39;d need to see downside of the economic cycle to shift this low vol environ; keep an eye on centrla banks, banks and institutions updated growth forecasts for cues as to when this may start shifting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Forays above 1.14 seem short-lived for the single currency. The next catalyst that may challenge this may actually come from the US, with Friday&#39;s release of the ISM data; following soft GDP data for Q4, the influential survey may provide a reminder of the slowing global growth narrative, which may prompt some flows out of the USD. There is, of course, a problem with this view, Commerzbank says. &quot;Despite slowing growth and a fall of the ISM the economic situation in the US is solid, in addition to inflation at target, which means there is no reason to justify rate cut considerations.&quot; The bank suggests that only an external shock is likely to lead to that, which does not seem likley at the moment. &quot;In other words, Commerz says, &quot;the market can remain in stand by mode so that volatilities and the dollar continue to ease off only very, very slowly.&quot; From a technical perspective, some have noted that range in EUR may have shifted higher (evidenced by yesterday&#39;s jump in USD as Treasury yields jumped; the 1.1360-65 region held, which has raised hopes among technicians that an upside breakout could be on the cards).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The Yen has finally made meaningful ground above 111.00, chewing through the heavy exporter supply at the level for month-end, seeing USDJPY push up to 111.40 region, which coincides with 100dma (@ 111.32) and 200dma (@111.39). The 111.50 level now comes into focus, where there are reportedly offers; technicians argue that if that level is breached to the upside, it opens the way for 112.08 (76.4% level from the Oct to Jan move).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>After its sharp bounce this week, GBP seems happy to consolidate around/below 1.3300. Warnings continue to circulate about the speed of the GBP bounce; this week&#39;s upside has been driven by Brexit optimism, not a fundamental improvement of the UK economy, which has some arguing that GBP is overbought at these levels, and some profit taking could be on the cards. Nevertheless, the playbook has been &#39;buy on dips&#39;, and with the market judging that chances of a no deal Brexit have diminished, any positive news flow is still likely to put a burner underneath the Pound. analysts have talked about Sterling at 1.40-1.50 in the event a cliff-edge Brexit can be avoided, though 1.20 would be on the cards in a more malign scenario.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A modest reprieve for the Dollar in the form of Q4 US GDP data that surpassed consensus forecasts on several counts and was compounded by an even better Chicago PMI, with the Buck paring losses and/or extending its outperformance against weaker currency counterparts. However, the index remains prone to ongoing/residual month end selling for rebalancing purposes that are weighted more heavily vs the Euro. DXY currently just below the top of a 96.275-95.817 range and eyeing a couple of technical levels on a closing basis, at 96.003 and 96.071 (Fib and daily resistance respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some loss of momentum, but still the clear G10 leaders as the Franc extended safe-haven gains through parity vs the Usd and the 100 DMA at 0.9960 on its way to a circa 0.9925 peak at one stage, while the Swedish Krona pulled up just short of near term resistance against the Euro around 10.4550 in wake of a stellar Swedish GDP release, plus firm retail sales and PPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best major and a beneficiary of the aforementioned end of February FX model flows, which at least countered if not outweighed relatively light (Usd6.8 bn) SOMA demand. However, the single currency ran into resistance around 1.1420 vs the Usd and subsequently retreated below 1.1400 again along with 50/100 DMAs to test stops said to be sitting at 1.1365. Similarly, Eur/Gbp squeezed up to circa 0.8585 amidst RHS orders for month and fixing talk, but pulled back to 0.8560 as Cable held close to 1.3300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars have been under pressure throughout Thursday&rsquo;s session, with the Loonie trying to contain losses around 1.3200 amidst a downturn in crude, the broader Usd bounce and more soft Canadian data (PPI and current account). Meanwhile, the Aussie and Kiwi have continued to decline on the back of the latest contraction in China&rsquo;s official manufacturing PMI (now 3 months in a row), with the latter also suffering from a marked decline in NBNZ&rsquo;s business outlook overnight. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Aud are now approaching 0.7100 and 0.6800, after the former pairing showed some resilience on a pick-up in Australian Q4 Capex and eyeing decent option expiry interest between 0.7140-50 (1.3 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more concerted break up through 111.00 in Usd/Jpy and absorbing reported Japanese exporter supply at the big figure on the way to a new 111.38 range high, which coincides with key MAs (100 and 200 at 111.32 and 111.39 respectively). Meanwhile, the Pound pared some of its bullish Brexit momentum, and also faced hefty option expiries at 1.3325 (1 bn) vs the Usd that seemed to prevent another advance on Wednesday&rsquo;s 2019 high (1.3351) before Cable reversed through 1.3300.</p>\r\n",

The FTSE 100 (-0.7%) is underperforming its counterparts, weighed on by the pounds recent strength; additional downward pressure is exerted by Rolls Royce (-3.4%) at the bottom of the index in spite of strong earnings as the Co. have withdrawn from Boeing&rsquo;s engine race. British American Tobacco (-2.5%) are in the red in-spite of good earnings; with some analysts attributing this to a lack of guidance for 2019. Sectors are also in the red with some marginal outperformance in telecom names. Other notable movers include, Zalando (+17.6%) who are leading the Stoxx 600 after their Q4 adj. EBIT came in above expectations; AB InBev (+5.1%) are also higher after a beat on their Q4 revenue. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Adecco (-4.7%) after the Co. posted a Q4 net loss of EUR 112mln instead of the expected net profit of EUR 150mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/CHF - Super strong Q4 GDP data from Sweden after the surprise contraction in the previous quarter has propelled the Krona through 10.5000 vs the Euro and further above recent lows, but the Franc is also a marked G10 outperformer following sub-forecast Swiss growth in the final 3 months of 2018 and a weaker than expected KoF survey, with Usd/Chf probing below the 100 DMA at 0.9960, while Eur/Chf has slipped under 1.1350. Indeed, the Franc is firmer across the board and clearly benefiting from its premier status as the safest currency destination amidst a storm, with risk sentiment still fragile due to ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, and in wake of the Trump-Kim summit ending without a nuclear agreement. Back to Eur/Sek, nearest technical support level is seen at 10.4550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR - Also firmer into month end, and partly on the aforementioned risk-off or defensive positioning as the Jpy rebounds from 111.00 vs the Dollar yet again (heavy exporter supply touted at the big figure). Eur/Usd has now firmly breached the 1.14 level to the upside, for reference the current high is 1.1418, after surpassing both the 50 and 100 DMA&rsquo;s, looking ahead is the February 5th high of 1.1441 and prior to this 1.1420. Of note moderate rebalancing sell signals for the Buck are said to be &lsquo;strongest&rsquo; against the Euro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/GBP/NZD/CAD - All flat to marginally weaker vs the Greenback, with the Aussie and Kiwi undermined by a 3rd consecutive sub-50.0 Chinese manufacturing PMI overnight after mixed independent impulses via a welcome beat in Australian Q4 Capex vs a deterioration in the NBNZ business outlook for the current month. Hence, Aud/Usd is holding up marginally better than Nzd/Usd within 0.7166-28 and 0.6854-35 respective ranges. Meanwhile, the Pound retains a relatively strong Brexit-related bid, albeit off best levels posted on Wednesday, with Cable pivoting 1.3300 vs its new 1.3351 ytd peak and perhaps wary about hefty option expiry interest at 1.3325 (1 bn). Elsewhere, the Loonie has stalled alongside oil prices and is back around the 1.3150 axis vs its US counterpart, as the DXY continues to skirt 96.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Unsurprisingly, the KRW has depreciated in disappointment over no breakthrough on a deal between the US and NK, to a low of almost 1125.00 vs the Usd at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to yesterday and other sessions of late, it appears that Bunds have been calling the tune after topping out just ahead of 166.00 and resistance just above the big figure (like 166.02 that represents a 50% retracement of yesterday&rsquo;s pronounced fall). Firmer German state CPI could also have impacted alongside a rebound in French household spending and BTPs after the EU deferred excess deficit proceedings pending a response to a request to revise the 2019 budget. Back to the charts, a close market contact and service subscriber suggests that intraday longs may have set stops on at the Eurex opening low (165.71), and could have stepped back in at the new intraday base (165.54) as this roughly aligned to support between 162.56-52 that held &lsquo;firm&rsquo; on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Gilts have pared more losses, but remained just above parity at their fresh 126.07 Liffe low having lost a lot of ground relative to Bunds recently on Brexit developments, and US Treasuries are also keeping their heads above water with the curve unwinding a degree of its post-Fed chair and supply-induced steepening ahead of a busy end of month agenda.

        "content": "<p>In contrast to yesterday and other sessions of late, it appears that Bunds have been calling the tune after topping out just ahead of 166.00 and resistance just above the big figure (like 166.02 that represents a 50% retracement of yesterday&rsquo;s pronounced fall). Firmer German state CPI could also have impacted alongside a rebound in French household spending and BTPs after the EU deferred excess deficit proceedings pending a response to a request to revise the 2019 budget. Back to the charts, a close market contact and service subscriber suggests that intraday longs may have set stops on at the Eurex opening low (165.71), and could have stepped back in at the new intraday base (165.54) as this roughly aligned to support between 162.56-52 that held &lsquo;firm&rsquo; on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Gilts have pared more losses, but remained just above parity at their fresh 126.07 Liffe low having lost a lot of ground relative to Bunds recently on Brexit developments, and US Treasuries are also keeping their heads above water with the curve unwinding a degree of its post-Fed chair and supply-induced steepening ahead of a busy end of month agenda. To recap, weekly claims and GDP are scheduled along with a host of Fed speakers.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>SEK/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Super strong Q4 GDP data from Sweden after the surprise contraction in the previous quarter has propelled the Krona through 10.5000 vs the Euro and further above recent lows, but the Franc is also a marked G10 outperformer following sub-forecast Swiss growth in the final 3 months of 2018 and a weaker than expected KoF survey, with Usd/Chf probing below the 100 DMA at 0.9960, while Eur/Chf has slipped under 1.1350. Indeed, the Franc is firmer across the board and clearly benefiting from its premier status as the safest currency destination amidst a storm, with risk sentiment still fragile due to ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, and in wake of the Trump-Kim summit ending without a nuclear agreement. Back to Eur/Sek, nearest technical support level is seen at 10.4550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmer into month end, and partly on the aforementioned risk-off or defensive positioning as the Jpy rebounds from 111.00 vs the Dollar yet again (heavy exporter supply touted at the big figure) and the single currency embarks on another attempt to clear the 1.1400 level convincingly. However, Eur/Usd needs to sustain a breach of converging MA resistance as the 50 and 100 marks come in at 1.1387 and 1.1389 respectively, although moderate rebalancing sell signals for the Buck are said to be &lsquo;strongest&rsquo; against the Euro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/GBP/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All flat to marginally weaker vs the Greenback, with the Aussie and Kiwi undermined by a 3rd consecutive sub-50.0 Chinese manufacturing PMI overnight after mixed independent impulses via a welcome beat in Australian Q4 Capex vs a deterioration in the NBNZ business outlook for the current month. Hence, Aud/Usd is holding up marginally better than Nzd/Usd within 0.7166-28 and 0.6854-35 respective ranges. Meanwhile, the Pound retains a relatively strong Brexit-related bid, albeit off best levels posted on Wednesday, with Cable pivoting 1.3300 vs its new 1.3351 ytd peak and perhaps wary about hefty option expiry interest at 1.3325 (1 bn). Elsewhere, the Loonie has stalled alongside oil prices and is back around the 1.3150 axis vs its US counterpart, as the DXY continues to skirt 96.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the KRW has depreciated in disappointment over no breakthrough on a deal between the US and NK, to a low of almost 1125.00 vs the Usd at one stage.</p>\r\n",

The early range spans 126.20-35 vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 125.99 settlement, as Gilts and the STIR strip get some respite from Brexit-related downside pressure amidst a general deterioration in risk sentiment following the somewhat abrupt end to US President Trump&rsquo;s summit with NK&rsquo;s Kim and due to the ongoing Kashmiri dispute. In terms of domestic inputs, no real change on the Brexit front in wake of last night&rsquo;s Parliament amendment votes, while data/surveys have been rather mixed, so UK debt and 3 month contracts will be looking elsewhere for inspiration as February draws to a close.</p>\r\n",

The Dow was also weighed on by shares from UnitedHealth which closed lower by almost 5% whilst the S&amp;P was pressured by the telecom and healthcare sectors. ASX 200 (+0.3%) was kept afloat by its pharma and energy names, while the Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) felt pressure from its heavyweight industrial and machinery sectors. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) initially traded choppy although the latter recovered from opening losses as pharma and finance stocks led the gains. Finally, South Korea&rsquo;s KOSPI (-0.6%) slipped after index heavyweights Samsung Electronics (-1.8%) and SK Hynix (-4.2%) succumbed to the semiconductor weakness experienced stateside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTR Lighthizer said the US would reserve the right to retaliate if China violates the pact. He added that China is probably not intervening in markets to make its currency weaker but is probably manipulating currency to strengthen it right now. Lighthizer said US-China enforcement mechanism if agreed, will entail monthly, quarterly and six-month review meetings. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said a China-US trade deal could be made when Chinese President Xi visits Trump in March. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Board Member Suzuki says it is important for the BoJ to maintain powerful monetary easing but there is no need to ease further, BoJ must be mindful of a sustainable framework as inflation may remain subdued for a prolonged period. Suzuki said the BoJ does not intend to raise rates now but will act swiftly through market operations if yield rise sharply, he added that overseas tail risk appear to be heightening. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ and RBI have signed a bilateral swap agreement, effective immediately. The agreement would allow Japan and India to swap their domestic currencies against the USD for an amount of up to USD 75bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan will go ahead with arranging a US-Japan trade talk schedule; according to the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga. Furthermore, there were reports that US and Japan are to hold their first meeting on a Trade Agreement on Goods in April. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank of Korea maintained its 7-day repo rate at 1.75% as expected, the decision was unanimous. The KRW immediately experienced marginal weakness as policymakers kept in mind the country&rsquo;s declining exports, rising unemployment and the slowdown in Chinese growth. At the press conference, Governor Lee the central bank is to maintain accommodative rate policy although it is not time to consider easing policy rates.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BREXIT AMENDMENTS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Cooper (F) amendment accepted - 502 lawmakers vote for it, 20 against it - which would note May&#39;s commitment to hold a vote on March 14th on whether to delay Brexit, if Parliament has rejected her deal and leaving without a deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit amendment Costa (B) has been approved without a formal vote; which would have called for more protections regarding the rights of EU citizens living in the UK in a no-deal scenario.

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is to formally announce a series of new pledges workers&rsquo; rights and easing of trade union restrictions in a bid to get Labour backing for her deal. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norway&rsquo;s GBP 740bln wealth fund has taken a 30-year bet that the UK will emerge stronger post-Brexit. The fund said it would increase exposure to UK companies, property and bonds regardless of the outcome of Brexit dialogue. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Business Secretary is set to make it easier for unions to strike as he steps up efforts to woo Labour MPs to back Theresa May&rsquo;s Brexit deal.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY remained tentative above 96.000 ahead of the release of US prelim Q4 GDP figures. As such EUR/USD traded sideways below its 50 and 100 DMAs both around 1.1387-89, meanwhile GBP/USD held onto most of its recent gains and moved sideways just above 1.3300 throughout most of the session before drifting lower to test the figure. SocGen FX analysts note that it is dangerous to chase Cable higher as it tests 1.3300, although the bank still expects the pair to be at 1.4000 this time next year, citing an absence of a no-deal Brexit, but should a no-deal scenario play out, the analysts expect Cable to drop to 1.2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects GBP to rally further as foreign investors who bought hedges during the 2016 Brexit vote will need to trim those positions amidst the increasing probability of an Article 50 extension. Elsewhere, the antipodeans felt pressured amid the release of mostly downbeat data. NZD and AUD both fell following a deterioration in New Zealand Business Outlook, although the Aussie felt some reprieve following optimistic Australian CAPEX numbers, but the release of a third straight contraction in Chinese Manufacturing PMI sent the antipodeans to session lows. Finally, it is also worth noting that Westpac downgraded its Australia Q4 GDP forecasts in light of yesterday&rsquo;s construction activity, which fell by 3.1% and turned out to be a material downside surprise for the bank. Finally, the INR was volatile but ultimately firmer at the open amid reports that the BoJ and RBI signed a bilateral swap agreement which allow Japan and India to swap their domestic currencies against the Dollar for an amount of up to USD 75bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Capital Expenditure Q4 2.0% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. -0.5%) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand NBNZ Business Outlook Feb -30.9% (Prev. -24.1%) (Newswires)<br />New Zealand NBNZ Own Activity Feb 10.5% (Prev. 13.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westpac cut Australia Q4 GDP estimates to +0.2% Q/Q (Prev. +0.5%) and +2.4% Y/Y (Prev. +2.7%) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s advances which was spurred by a significant surprise decline in US crude stocks. WTI futures roamed just below USD 57.00/bbl whilst Brent futures drifted marginally lower at the open as the Chinese manufacturing sector fell deeper into contraction. Elsewhere, spot gold hovered near two-week lows following the cautious comments from USTR Lighthizer, while copper was relatively steady as supply concerns balanced the three-month back-to-back contraction in Chinese manufacturing PMI. Finally, Dalian iron ore crept higher despite supply glut worries, with traders expecting demand for the base material to pick up as better weather paves the way for more construction activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTR Lighthizer says US President Trump wants a deal with Mexico and Canada on steel. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s NOC spokesperson says there is no technical obstacle to restarting the El-Sharara oilfield although security is &quot;the issue&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the speed of North Korean denuclearisation is not important to him, he is more concerned on getting a good deal. Meanwhile, North Korean Leader Kim Jung Un said it is too early to say whether he is confident, but he feels a good outcome will come from meeting with US President Trump. Furthermore, US is reportedly no longer demanding North Korea to disclose full accounting of nukes and ballistic missiles; according to NBC citing current and former US officials. (Newswires/NBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean Leader KIm Jung Un said if North Korea was not ready to denuclearise, then he would not have met with US President Trump; and added that they are discussing steps for that. US President Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jung Un both said that a diplomatic office exchange is a good idea. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Airlines have reportedly rerouted flights from East Asia to European destinations to avoid flying over Pakistan and Northern India amid the rising tensions between the two countries. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US curve bear steepened on Wednesday. There was speculation as to what the trigger of today&rsquo;s downside was, with the most convincing explanation that accounts were putting on steepeners to hedge the upcoming IG supply in the long-end, which in turn set-off sell programmes. The steepeners were said to be inspired by Powell&rsquo;s rhetoric, though his comments over the last two day&rsquo;s have not really provided all that new to the FOMC narrative; it seems traders have been comforted by his continuing talk of pause. * US T-Note futures (H9) settled 13 ticks lower at 121-29+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell (Neutral) said unrealised losses on the balance sheet do not affect monetary policy; in no sense is the Fed functionally insolvent. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs cuts its GDP tracker (Q4) to 1.7% (prev. 2.1%), due to a record high goods trade balance in December and the downward revisions to core CAPEX shipments.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks are mostly higher despite an inspiring lead from Wall Street in which the Dow and S&amp;P fell for a second consecutive day as investors digested key testimonies from US Trade Representative Lighthizer and Fed Chair Powell. The Dow was also weighed on by share from UnitedHealth, whilst the S&amp;P was led lower by the telecom and healthcare sectors. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is kept afloat by the healthcare and energy names, while the Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is pressured by its heavyweight industrial and machinery sectors. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.4%) recovered from opening losses as pharma and finance stocks led the gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets. DXY pulled back from recent highs but remains tentative above 96.000 ahead of the release of US prelim GDP for the fourth quarter. As such EUR/USD mostly trades sideways below its 50 and 100 DMAs both around 1.1387-89, meanwhile GBP/USD held onto its recent gains and trades sideways just above 1.3300. SocGen FX analysts note that it is dangerous to chase Cable higher as it tests 1.3300, although the bank still expects the pair to be at 1.4000 this time next year, citing an absence of a no-deal Brexit, but should a no-deal scenario play out, the analysts expect Cable to drop to 1.2000. Elsewhere, the antipodeans felt pressured amid the release of mostly downbeat data. NZD and AUD fell following a deterioration in New Zealand Business Outlook, although the Aussie felt some reprieve following optimistic Australian CAPEX numbers, but the release of a third straight contraction in Chinese Manufacturing PMI sent the antipodeans to session lows. Finally, it is also worth noting that Westpac downgraded its Australia Q4 GDP forecasts in light of yesterday&rsquo;s construction activity, which fell by 3.1% and turned out to be a material downside surprise for the bank.</p>\r\n",
