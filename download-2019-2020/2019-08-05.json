The tech sector, with its greater exposure to trade frictions with China, was worst hit. The FANG Index (of Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)) sunk to near two-month lows, whilst the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which includes names such as Micron Technologies (MU), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and&nbsp; Intel (INTC), moved below July lows. Other notable stocks with China exposure, including Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Skyworks Solutions (SKYW) also underperformer. The energy sector was pressured by lower crude prices and financials pressured by lower yields. Construction metals miners, including Alcoa Corp (AA), United States Steel Corp (X) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) were dragged lower as steel and aluminium prices fell off a cliff. Bucking the trend were precious metals miners, such as Barrick Gold (GOLD) and Newmont Goldcorp (NEM), as gold prices reached fresh YTD highs. Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) has saw some upside on reports that it had hired advisors to study a potential sale. Abiomed (ABMD) moved higher on the news of higher than expected rates within its final inpatient prospective payment system. Arms maker American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), opened higher after the mass shootings this weekend, as normally occurs when tighter regulations are mulled. Gaming names, including EA (EA), TakeTwo (TTWO) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI), were under pressure after US President Trump criticised video games, says too many are \"gruesome\" and need to be reduced immediately. Evercore made negative comments on Centene (CNC) and CVS (CVS), saying both are seen losing a Medicaid contract in Louisiana Evercore says winners could be UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM). S&amp;P 500 -3% at 2845, NASDAQ-100 -3.6% at 7416, Dow Jones -2.9% at 25718.</p><p>The Treasury curve bull steepened, with price action driven by risk-off flows, pushing Treasury yields down by between 10bps and 14bps across the curve. There was further buying in afternoon trade, after China had confirmed that state firms had stopped buys of US agriculture, and did not rule out sanctions on US ags in the future. Fed pricing has moved dovishly, with traders now seeing 111 worth of easing through the end of next year, from around 100bps of easing on Friday. A 25bps rate cut at the September meeting is priced with certainty, and there is now around 40% chance of the ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps at that meeting. Fed officials that have spoken have been quite circumspect, and hawkish George and dovish Brainard both indicated that they were monitoring the market. There are a host of other Fed officials on the slate for the week, and the desk will be paying particular attention to the dovish Bullard, who is due to speak on Tuesday; Bullard made the case ahead of the July Fed meeting that a 50bps cut was a bit too excessive. US T-note futures (U9) settled 31+ ticks higher at 129-27.</p>",

US stocks opened in the red, the Dow by over 400 points lower, and then extended losses before stabilising to over 800 points in afternoon; tech led the losses, followed by financials as the Treasury curve bull-steepened, with energy and telecoms also performing very similarly. Oil was lower, with traders focussing on the potential hit to global demand growth as trade war tensions ramp up.</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>Risk sentiment was hit after China’s PBOC allowed the yuan to trade above the psychological 7.00 mark for the first time since 2008, which had previously been seen as a ‘line in the sand’ that Beijing was prepared to defend. The move followed the announcement of further tariffs on Chinese imports last week. The Chinese have also reportedly cancelled purchases of US agricultural goods, attacking two areas close to Trump’s heart (the dollar, and agriculture). China’s Global Times Editors confirmed these reports, saying “based on what I know, in view of new tariff threat by the US side, the Chinese side has decided to suspend tariff exemption for US farms goods and Chinese enterprises have halted buying US farm products.” China state media later confirmed that state companies had paused purchases of US agriculture, and did not rule out placing tariffs on US ags on purchases made after 3rd August. US President Trump took the opportunity to accuse China of currency manipulation, stating that it dropped the price of the currency to an almost a historic low, and that \"it's called ‘currency manipulation.’ Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time.\" Trump later continued his attack, accusing China of using currency manipulation to steal business from the US, and reiterated his claim that the US consumer was not ‘paying for the tariffs’; on which note, some desks have argued that in his belief that US consumers are not being hurt by tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump may be more inclined to increase them further. Trump’s calls to label China a currency manipulator once again drew the support of Democrat Senate Minority Leader Schumer, who has also called for such action in the past.</p><p><strong>* YUAN ANALYSIS: </strong>The yuan weakened overnight to above 7.00 against the USD, for the first time in a decade, after the US' latest escalation of trade wars last week, where it announced fresh 10% tariffs on the remaining portion of Chinese imports (around USD 300bln worth); overnight, there were also reports that China had asked state buyers to halt US agriculture imports. The 7.00 level was previously considered a 'line in the sand' for the PBOC, which had kept it stable beneath that level recently. The move higher has resulted in a significant risk-off reaction in markets, where havens have found buyers, while more risk-on assets have been hit. There were previously also concerns that a move above the 7.00 mark could contribute to outflows from China. And the PBOC Governor reiterated that position in comments during the European day, stating that China will not engage in competitive devaluations. In that regard, the PBOC attempted to inspire some confidence, stating that the breach of 7.00 does not mean the yuan will not come back, and that it has the experience, confidence and capacity to keep the renminbi exchange rate fundamentally stable and at a reasonable and balanced level. Desks have also noted that the central bank has also recently supported business purchasing FX hedging products. And the PBOC has also advised enterprises not to speculate on yuan moves to profit from derivatives trading, since the yuan trend is difficult to predict, hinting that there may be more volatility ahead. The PBOC's response was somewhat predictable, since it doesn't want to be accused of manipulating the currency (China is on the US' monitoring list, but has not yet been labelled a 'currency manipulator'). Natwest, after speaking to clients in Beijing recently, said Beijing has made it clear the PBOC would use the fixings, its capital controls and possible some off-balance sheet transactions to manage the yuan's move lower, but would not run down their FX reserves dramatically as they did in 2015-2016. Desks note that China has gone after two areas close to Trump -- the currency, and agricultural purchases -- in its retaliation against the US announcement of further tariffs. Natwest says that if the central bank isn't willing to use their FX reserves aggressively then the move though 7.00 will be sustained and significant. This may support arguments that Trump could instruct the Treasury to intervene in FX to arrest the USD appreciation. Last week, the Fed also eased policy last week as insurance against any trade risks weighing on its outlook, and Trump seems to have manipulated the Fed into remaining accommodative in the months ahead. The breach of 7.00 underscores that global markets and policymakers will have to get used to a more market-driven CNY and the greater variability that comes along with that, Oxford Economics says. Building on that, SocGen notes that the CNY is second to the EUR in its weight in the Fed's trade weighted USD basket, and it also has the biggest weighting in the ECB’s trade weighted EUR basket. \"For the euro, it’s another weight to bear as weaker trade hurts an economy without enough growth to cope with a stronger (trade-weighted) currency. For the US President of course, with his concerns about the dollar being too strong, it is going to be a source of significant irritation. The debate about US FX intervention is going to heat up significantly.\"</p><p><strong>* US NON-MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>The non-manufacturing ISM fell to a three-year low, falling to 53.7 from 55.1; the data suggests that the downturn seen in manufacturing is now spreading into the larger services sector. \"A weighted average of the ISM indices is consistent with zero economic growth at the start of the third quarter\" Capital Economics said, but added that it does not think that the economy is about to plunge into recession: \"after all, payroll employment growth is still solid and other leading indicators, including initial jobless claims, show few signs of deterioration, but the ISM survey clearly supports our view that economic growth will slow sharply in the second half of this year.\" The headline was dragged by business activity, which fell to 53.1 from 58.2. New orders also slipped, signalling some cooling ahead. Employment was up slightly, but the read is slightly redundant seen as we have already got the NFP report for the month last week. \"Regardless, there’s no denying that this is a weak report, and it also isn’t the only survey pointing to a sharp slowdown,\" CapEco says, \"despite upward revisions to the final estimate released today, the July Markit composite PMI also points to a slowdown in GDP growth, to little more than 1% annualised.\" The consultancy notes that the weakness in the US economy has so far been concentrated in the export-focused manufacturing sector, but signs that this malaise is now spreading to the services sector will undoubtedly be a concern for Fed officials. \"We had assumed that the next rate cut would be delayed until December, but the apparent slowdown in service-sector activity growth, the escalation of trade tensions with China and the continued sell-off in the stock market mean that the chances of a cut at the September FOMC meeting are rising rapidly.\"</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Havens <strong>JPY</strong>, <strong>CHF</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> caught a bid amid the risk-off after China’s yuan slid against the <strong>USD</strong>. The Buck, however, could not catch a bid, amid the spectre of potential USD intervention, an easing Fed, and a grim ISM non-manufacturing report. The <strong>EUR</strong> – which usually takes a hit on escalating trade tensions – was stronger, supported by US/EU Rate differentials; the yuan has the largest weighting in the ECB’s trade weighted EUR index, which has been supporting the EUR on Monday, while the USD weakness is also helping the single currency; in a sign of the EUR’s strength, EURJPY was actually higher, despite the yen rising against most other FX. The <strong>Antipodes</strong> and <strong>EMFX</strong> were also whacked on Monday.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif reiterated that Iran will walk away from the 2015 Nuclear Deal if needs be; more specifically, if Iran’s interests weren’t upheld. Zarif called on the remaining European signatories to make good on their commitments “to shield Iran’s economy from US sanctions” (e.g. by purchasing its oil). The Foreign Minister, who is considered one the least hawkish Iranian officials, said the US’ sanctions were “economic terrorism”, and feels like the US isn’t interested in talks, and Iran will never capitulate. Later on, an Iranian Atomic Energy spokesperson said provided the Europeans don’t hold up their end of the nuclear deal, Iran would take a third step in reducing commitments within a month, affirming that it has already reduced its commitments to the nuclear deal by holding over 130 tonnes of heavy water and breaching the 300kg stockpile limit of enriched uranium.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Boris Johnson has no intention of renegotiating Brexit deal, EU was told according to the Guardian. A no-deal Brexit remains Johnson's 'central scenario', the chief Brussels envoy reportedly said. The news comes amid hardening evidence in Westminster that the government is expecting to crash out of the EU, the Guardian claims.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 31+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-27.</strong> The Treasury curve bull steepened, with price action driven by risk-off flows, pushing Treasury yields down by between 10bps and 14bps across the curve. There was further buying in afternoon trade, after China had confirmed that state firms had stopped buys of US agriculture, and did not rule out sanctions on US ags in the future. Fed pricing has moved dovishly, with traders now seeing 111 worth of easing through the end of next year, from around 100bps of easing on Friday. A 25bps rate cut at the September meeting is priced with certainty, and there is now around 40% chance of the ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps at that meeting. Fed officials that have spoken have been quite circumspect, and hawkish George and dovish Brainard both indicated that they were monitoring the market. There are a host of other Fed officials on the slate for the week, and the desk will be paying particular attention to the dovish Bullard, who is due to speak on Tuesday; Bullard made the case ahead of the July Fed meeting that a 50bps cut was a bit too excessive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLES USD 0.97 LOWER AT USD 54.69/BBL; BRENT (V8) SETTLES USD 2.08 LOWER AT 59.81/BBL: </strong>The ramp-up of US-China trade tensions has helped crude futures kick-off the week on the back-foot. As equity market sentiment dips, global demand concerns linger in the energy complex and places supply-side factors on the back-burner, at least for the time being; analysts at Citigroup see potential for downgrades in the approaching EIA, IEA, and OPEC monthly reports’ oil demand growth forecasts. It is worth highlighting the WTI/Brent Arb which has been narrowing in the past couple of months, it is currently approaching the USD -5.00 mark, a level which has not been seen since this time last year. There are several factors which are likely to be playing into the Arb narrowing such as decreased Brent demand as trade moves to other crude sources which rely less on shipping through the risk-laden Strait of Hormuz, as well as a recent string of large draws in US crude inventories providing tailwinds to WTI which have been accelerated by recent weather disruptions and growing US crude exports.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -3% at 2845, NASDAQ-100 -3.6% at 7416, Dow Jones -2.9% at 25718. </strong>Consumer Discretionary -2.7%, Consumer Staples -2.7%, Energy -3%, Financials -3.3%, Health Care -2.4%, Industrials -2.8%, Information Technology -4.1%, Materials -1.9%, Telecommunication Services -2.9%, Utilities -1.5%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:&nbsp;</strong>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) outperformed the market after the co. reported decent net and operating earnings Y/Y. Jacobs Engineering Group (JEC) was buoyed after the co. beat on top and bottom lines and raised its FY EPS view. Tyson Foods (TSN) shot higher after the co. posted a beat on the bottom line and backed its FY EPS view, despite missing revenue expectations. WEC Energy Group Inc (WEC) advanced after the co. posted a beat on the bottom line and raised guidance. Loews Corp (L) fell despite posting a big beat on revenue expectations. ON Semiconductor Corp (ON) sunk on poor revenue and guidance.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:&nbsp;</strong>Last week’s tariff announcement by US President Trump, the retaliation from China and a collapse in the yuan through the 7.00 handle triggered further global risk off, which resulted US stocks falling across the board. The tech sector, with its greater exposure to trade frictions with China, was worst hit. The FANG Index (of Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)) sunk to near two-month lows, whilst the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which includes names such as Micron Technologies (MU), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and&nbsp; Intel (INTC), moved below July lows. Other notable stocks with China exposure, including Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Skyworks Solutions (SKYW) also underperformer. The energy sector was pressured by lower crude prices and financials pressured by lower yields. Construction metals miners, including Alcoa Corp (AA), United States Steel Corp (X) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) were dragged lower as steel and aluminium prices fell off a cliff. Bucking the trend were precious metals miners, such as Barrick Gold (GOLD) and Newmont Goldcorp (NEM), as gold prices reached fresh YTD highs. Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) has saw some upside on reports that it had hired advisors to study a potential sale. Abiomed (ABMD) moved higher on the news of higher than expected rates within its final inpatient prospective payment system. Arms maker American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), opened higher after the mass shootings this weekend, as normally occurs when tighter regulations are mulled. Gaming names, including EA (EA), TakeTwo (TTWO) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI), were under pressure after US President Trump criticised video games, says too many are \"gruesome\" and need to be reduced immediately. Evercore made negative comments on Centene (CNC) and CVS (CVS), saying both are seen losing a Medicaid contract in Louisiana Evercore says winners could be UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM).</p>",

There was further buying in afternoon trade, after China had confirmed that state firms had stopped buys of US agriculture, and did not rule out sanctions on US ags in the future. Fed pricing has moved dovishly, with traders now seeing 111 worth of easing through the end of next year, from around 100bps of easing on Friday. A 25bps rate cut at the September meeting is priced with certainty, and there is now around 40% chance of the ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps at that meeting. Fed officials that have spoken have been quite circumspect, and hawkish George and dovish Brainard both indicated that they were monitoring the market. There are a host of other Fed officials on the slate for the week, and the desk will be paying particular attention to the dovish Bullard, who is due to speak on Tuesday; Bullard made the case ahead of the July Fed meeting that a 50bps cut was a bit too excessive.&nbsp;</p>",

As equity market sentiment dips, global demand concerns linger in the energy complex and places supply-side factors on the back-burner, at least for the time being; analysts at Citigroup see potential for downgrades in the approaching EIA, IEA, and OPEC monthly reports’ oil demand growth forecasts. It is worth highlighting the WTI/Brent Arb which has been narrowing in the past couple of months, it is currently approaching the USD -5.00 mark, a level which has not been seen since this time last year. There are several factors which are likely to be playing into the Arb narrowing such as decreased Brent demand as trade moves to other crude sources which rely less on shipping through the risk-laden Strait of Hormuz, as well as a recent string of large draws in US crude inventories providing tailwinds to WTI which have been accelerated by recent weather disruptions and growing US crude exports.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>Although risk aversion has not reached new proportions or turned into a full-scale rout (yet), the traditional safe havens remain sought after with the Franc hovering around 0.9750 vs the Dollar and 1.0900 against the Euro, even though the single currency is actually slightly firmer compared to the Buck and perhaps gleaning more from the meltdown in EM currencies (or even SNB intervention as the Eur/Chf cross has bounced from circa 1.0865?) Moreover, technical impulses may be helping Eur/Usd continue its climb from 1.1105 through Fib resistance at 1.1174, the 21 DMA (1.1186) and eyeing 1.1200. However, the Yen has pared some gains within 105.80-106.67 parameters and also testing a key retracement level (106.06) as US Treasury yields bounce (marginally) from their lows.</p><p><strong>DXY/CNH</strong></p><p>The index has slipped a bit further from post-FOMC highs of 98.941 (also a new 2019 peak) amidst a ramp up in US-China trade wars and in wake of a weak US non-manufacturing ISM survey wot just under 97.500 at one stage. Meanwhile, President Trump has responded to the Cny and Cnh slide through 7.0000 and accused Beijing of currency manipulation only a few months after the last official US Treasury report (published around the end of May) did not label China as one of the nations that has used devaluation to its advantage. The PBoC insists the Yuan’s move well below the overnight mid-point setting (6.9225) was not orchestrated, but perhaps more poignantly added that it is at an ‘appropriate’ level, so not past the point of tolerance. Note, Usd/Cnh is currently just under 7.1000 vs 7.1087 at one stage and the Cny ended on-shore trade around 7.0352.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Although off worst levels within a 0.6805-0.6750 range vs its US counterpart the Aussie is still on the defensive ahead of the overnight RBA meeting, the aforementioned heightened US-China angst and China’s softer than forecast Caixin services PMI. Nevertheless, a dovish message from the Central Bank could well put the Aud back under pressure given option pricing indicating a 50 pip break even for the event and the early year flash crash base not too far away (0.6715). Conversely, the Kiwi has clawed back losses vs the Greenback between 0.6490-0.6542 and extended gains vs its Antipodean peer with Aud/Nzd slipping towards 1.0350 as a ¼ point RBNZ ease is fully priced in the for this week and the near term focus is on NZ jobs data later tonight.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns have also been hit by broad risk-off sentiment and the relative Euro strength noted above, with Eur/Nok fuelled by the downturn in crude as well as it rebounds to 9.9950+ and outpaces Eur/Sek at just over 10.7700 in percentage terms.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling is swooning again on no deal Brexit risk as new UK PM Johnson reiterates that October 31 is set in stone as a departure date from the EU with or without a formal agreement. Cable is back near 1.2100 vs almost 1.2190 after a better than expected services PMI and Eur/Gbp has breached 0.9200 amidst some talk of possible fix demand (ie RHS orders).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Brazilian Real and Turkish Lira, as the former gets scant relief from the overall decline in risk appetite from latest reports about a vote on the Pension Reform Bill, possibly by midweek, but the latter outperforms on softer than anticipated CPI and CBRT tweaks to RRRs that are estimated to result in a Usd2.1 bn drain.</p>",

China exposed firms in particular, including <strong>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)</strong>, <strong>Micron Technologies (MU)</strong>, <strong>Johnson Controls (JCI)</strong> and <strong>Wynn Resorts (WYNN)</strong>, were under pressure in premarket trade. Other risk/trade sensitive sectors, including the <strong>tech</strong> and <strong>auto maker </strong>sectors, were under pressure, with the FANG index in particular suffering. Meanwhile, amid the risk-off triggered collapse in metal prices, <strong>mining names</strong> suffered, with only gold miners, including <strong>Newmont Goldcorp (NEM)</strong> and <strong>Barrick Gold (GOLD)</strong> bucking the trend as the safe haven metal hit fresh YTD highs.</p><p>DOW</p><p><strong>Apple Inc.

The declines in these indices may have thus forced CTAs into loss-cutting mode.\"</li><li>CTAs' net long position in S&amp;P 500 futures is still only 25% smaller than it was at the 16 July peak, Nomura notes, and CTA's net long position in NASDAQ 100 futures is only 30% smaller than at the 11 July peak. \"We therefore expect futures to remain under significant systematic selling pressure.\"</li></ul>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: USDCNY above 7.00 on trade war escalation and protectionism",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>YUAN WEAKNESS: </strong>The yuan weakened overnight to above 7.00 against the USD, for the first time in a decade, after the US' latest escalation of trade wars last week, where it announced fresh 10% tariffs on the remaining portion of Chinese imports (around USD 300bln worth); overnight, there were also reports that China had asked state buyers to halt US agriculture imports.</li><li><strong>THE 7.00 LEVEL: </strong>The 7.00 level was previously considered a 'line in the sand' for the PBOC, which had kept it stable beneath that level recently. The move higher has resulted in a significant risk-off reaction in markets, where havens have found buyers, while more risk-on assets have been hit. There were previously also concerns that a move above the 7.00 mark could contribute to outflows from China. And the PBOC Governor reiterated that position in comments during the European day, stating that China will not engage in competitive devaluations.</li><li><strong>PBOC TO BE ACTIVE: </strong>In that regard, the PBOC attempted to inspire some confidence, stating that the breach of 7.00 does not mean the yuan will not come back, and that it has the experience, confidence and capacity to keep the renminbi exchange rate fundamentally stable and at a reasonable and balanced level. Desks have also noted that the central bank has also recently supported business purchasing FX heding products. And the PBOC has also advised enterprises not to speculate on yuan moves to profit from derrivatives trading, since the yuan trend is difficult to predict, hinting that there may be more volatility ahead.</li><li><strong>YUAN FIXINGS: </strong>The PBOC's response was somewhat predictable, since it doesn't want to be accused of manipulating the currency (China is on the US' monitoring list, but has not yet been labelled a 'currency manipulator'). Natwest, after speaking to clients in Beijing recently, said Beijing has made it clear the PBOC would use the fixings, its capital controls and possible some off-balance sheet transactions to manage the yuan's move lower, but would not run down their FX reserves dramatically as they did in 2015-2016.</li><li><strong>USD INTERVENTION: </strong>Desks note that China has gone after two areas close to Trump -- the currency, and agricultural purchases -- in its retaliation against the US announcement of further tariffs. Natwest says that if the central bank isn't willing to use their FX reserves aggressively then the move though 7.00 will be sustained and significant. This may support arguments that Trump could instruct the Treasury to intervene in FX to arrest the USD appreciation. Last week, the Fed also eased policy last week as insurance against any trade risks weighing on its outlook, and Trump seems to have manipulated the Fed into remaining accommodative in the months ahead.</li><li><strong>AFTER THOUGHT: </strong>The breach of 7.00 underscores that global markets and policymakers will have to get used to a more market-driven CNY and the greater variability that comes along with that, Oxford Economics says. Building on that, SocGen notes that the CNY is second to the EUR in its weight in the Fed's trade weighted USD basket, and it also has the biggest weighting in the ECB’s trade weighted EUR basket. \"For the euro, it’s another weight to bear as weaker trade hurts an economy without enough growth to cope with a stronger (trade-weighted) currency. For the US President of course, with his concerns about the dollar being too strong, it is going to be a source of significant irritation. The debate about US FX intervention is going to heat up significantly.\"</li></ul>",

(-1.6%)</strong> also slipped amid the escalation of trade tensions with underperformance in Hong Kong as protests continued and with a 500k-strong city-wide strike said to be planned which disrupted public transport and saw more than 130 flights cancelled, while the latest Hong Kong PMI data printed at a decade low due to the impact from the ongoing disorder and trade dispute. Furthermore, a miss in Chinese Caixin Services PMI added to the glum, with the selling exacerbated after the PBoC weakened the reference rate which pressured CNH to a record low against the greenback past the 7.0000 level seen by some to be a sticking-point for China and in turn, raised concerns of China weaponizing its currency. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned as the widespread risk averse tone spurred safe-haven buying which saw 10yr JGB futures post a record high and the 10yr yield drop to its lowest in 3 years at around -0.2%, while T-notes also found support overnight and the BoJ were present in the market today under its massive bond buying program.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

Additionally, the collapse of the CNH to 7.0+ status vs. the USD also added further jitters to the trade-sensitive sentiment. Indices are firmly in the red but have crawled off lows in recent trade after China State Planner dismissed President Trump’s accusation that China has not bought US farm goods, adding that US and China agreed to China will purchase 14mln tonnes of soybeans from the US, with 2mln to be loaded in August. Sectors are in the red across the board with some mild resilience in defensive sectors. To the downside, miners fare the worst amid the freefall in base metal prices due to a bleaker demand outlook in the sector as protectionism ramps up. Thus, ArcelorMittal (-4.5%), Antofagasta (-3.3%), Rio Tinto (-2.4%), and Anglo American (-3.5%) have all fallen to the foot of their respective bourses. However, Fresnillo (+4.0%) bucks the miners’ trend as the Co. benefits from the safe-haven surge in gold prices. European luxury names and the auto sectors are also bearing the brunt of the US-China trade spat with LVMH (-2.9%), Kering (-2.1%), Volkswagen (-2.7%), Daimler (-2.5%), BMW (-2.4%) and Peugeot (-3.1%) all lower as a result. In terms of individual movers <strong>HSBC </strong>(-1.0%) shares opened lower due to the surprise stepping-down of CEO Flint, despite improvements in its metrics and the announcement of a share buyback program.&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD -</strong> The Aussie has been hit particularly hard by the Yuan’s slide through 7.0000 vs the Greenback on and offshore after the PBoC raised its official mid-point fix to 6.9225 overnight from 6.8996 last Friday. However, the sharp Cny and Cnh depreciation was sparked by reports that China has halted US agricultural produce purchases in retaliation to President Trump’s fresh tariff threat, with a softer than expected Caixin services PMI not helping as the composite PMI hit a 5 month low and Hong Kong’s headline print plunged to 42.8. All this undermining broad risk sentiment and base metals like iron or, with Aud/Usd dipping under 0.6750 at worst in the run up to the RBA policy meeting overnight with options pricing in a 50 pip break even that could expose the early January 0.6715 flash crash low if the Bank firmly flags more easing after a widely anticipated pause this time round – see the headline feed and/or Research Suite for a full preview.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/GBP -</strong> Also victims of heightened risk aversion amidst rising US-China trade tensions, with the Kiwi down though 0.6500 at one stage vs its US peer, but holding up a bit better than the Aussie ahead of Wednesday’s RBNZ rate decision that is unanimously forecast to result in the OCR being cut by a further 25 bp to 1.25%, mainly due to supportive cross-winds as Aud/Nzd reverses through 1.0400 again.

Additionally, the collapse of the CNH to 7.0+ status vs. the USD also added further jitters to the trade-sensitive sentiment. Indices are firmly in the red but have crawled off lows in recent trade after China State Planner dismissed President Trump’s accusation that China has not bought US farm goods, adding that US and China agreed to China will purchase 14mln tonnes of soybeans from the US, with 2mln to be loaded in August. Sectors are in the red across the board with some mild resilience in defensive sectors. To the downside, miners fare the worst amid the freefall in base metal prices due to a bleaker demand outlook in the sector as protectionism ramps up. Thus, ArcelorMittal (-4.5%), Antofagasta (-3.3%), Rio Tinto (-2.4%), and Anglo American (-3.5%) have all fallen to the foot of their respective bourses. However, Fresnillo (+4.0%) bucks the miners’ trend as the Co. benefits from the safe-haven surge in gold prices. European luxury names and the auto sectors are also bearing the brunt of the US-China trade spat with LVMH (-2.9%), Kering (-2.1%), Volkswagen (-2.7%), Daimler (-2.5%), BMW (-2.4%) and Peugeot (-3.1%) all lower as a result. In terms of individual movers HSBC (-1.0%) shares opened lower due to the surprise stepping-down of CEO Flint, despite improvements in its metrics and the announcement of a share buyback program.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD</strong> - The Aussie has been hit particularly hard by the Yuan’s slide through 7.0000 vs the Greenback on and offshore after the PBoC raised its official mid-point fix to 6.9225 overnight from 6.8996 last Friday. However, the sharp Cny and Cnh depreciation was sparked by reports that China has halted US agricultural produce purchases in retaliation to President Trump’s fresh tariff threat, with a softer than expected Caixin services PMI not helping as the composite PMI hit a 5 month low and Hong Kong’s headline print plunged to 42.8. All this undermining broad risk sentiment and base metals like iron or, with Aud/Usd dipping under 0.6750 at worst in the run up to the RBA policy meeting overnight with options pricing in a 50 pip break even that could expose the early January 0.6715 flash crash low if the Bank firmly flags more easing after a widely anticipated pause this time round – see the headline feed and/or Research Suite for a full preview.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/GBP</strong> - Also victims of heightened risk aversion amidst rising US-China trade tensions, with the Kiwi down though 0.6500 at one stage vs its US peer, but holding up a bit better than the Aussie ahead of Wednesday’s RBNZ rate decision that is unanimously forecast to result in the OCR being cut by a further 25 bp to 1.25%, mainly due to supportive cross-winds as Aud/Nzd reverses through 1.0400 again.

Conversely, <strong>JPY</strong> strengthened on safe-haven flows which pressured <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> to below 106.00 for the first time since the flash crash at the beginning of the year, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CNY</strong> surged above the psychological key 7.0000 level for the first time since the GFC and <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CNH</strong> printed a record high at the 7.1100 handle after a softer reference rate setting by the PBoC which further spooked investor sentiment due to concerns of China weaponizing its currency in the trade war with the US. However, the PBoC later attributed the depreciation of the currency to trade protectionism, as well as tariffs on Chinese goods, and stated it will crack down on short-term speculation of the CNY.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were boosted above USD 1450/oz as the precious metal benefitted from its safe-haven status as well as a weaker greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> was dragged amid the sell-off in stocks and with pressure seen in Chinese commodity prices in which iron prices tumbled around 3% shortly after the open of Shanghai metals trade.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Baker Hughes Oil rigs -6 at 770, nat gas rigs +2 at 171, total rigs -4 at 942.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih spoke to Russia Energy Minister Novak about oil markets and stressed the kingdom would continue to comply with output cuts until the end of Q1 2020.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were lower across the board as the stock rout resumed from last week’s shock tariff announcement by US President Trump and with retaliation from China in which it asked state-run purchasers to halt US agriculture imports, while a collapse in the CNH through the 7.00 handle also exacerbated the risk averse tone. ASX 200 (-1.7%) weakened with the trade sensitive sectors such as tech and materials front-running the declines, although gold names bucked the trend on the precious metal’s safe-haven status, while Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) was pressured by a firmer currency and several disappointing earnings including Kobe Steel and Yahoo Japan which shares have suffered a double-digit percentage drop. Hang Seng (-2.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) also slipped amid the escalation of trade tensions with underperformance in Hong Kong as protests continued and with a 500k-strong city-wide strike said to be planned which disrupted public transport and saw more than 130 flights cancelled, while the latest Hong Kong PMI data printed at a decade low due to the impact from the ongoing disorder and trade dispute. Furthermore, a miss in Chinese Caixin Services PMI added to the glum, with the selling exacerbated after the PBoC weakened the reference rate which pressured CNH to a record low against the greenback past the 7.0000 level seen by some to be a sticking-point for China and in turn, raised concerns of China weaponizing its currency. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned as the widespread risk averse tone spurred safe-haven buying which saw 10yr JGB futures post a record high and the 10yr yield drop to its lowest in 3 years at around -0.2%, while T-notes also found support overnight and the BoJ were present in the market today under its massive bond buying program.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are lower across the board as the stock rout resumed from last week’s shock tariff announcement by US President Trump and with China vowing to retaliate in which it asked state-run purchasers to halt US agriculture imports, while a collapse in the CNH through the 7.00 handle also exacerbated the risk averse tone. ASX 200 (-1.3%) is lower with trade sensitive sectors such as tech and materials front-running the declines although gold names buck the trend on the precious metal’s safe-haven status, while Nikkei 225 (-2.3%) is pressured by a firmer currency and several disappointing earnings including Kobe Steel and Yahoo Japan which shares have suffered a double-digit percentage drop. Hang Seng (-2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) also slipped amid the escalation of trade tensions with underperformance in Hong Kong as protests continued and with a 500k-strong city-wide strike said to be planned which disrupted public transport and saw more than 130 flights cancelled, while the latest Hong Kong PMI data printed at a decade low due to the impact from the ongoing disorder and trade dispute. Furthermore, a miss in Chinese Caixin Services PMI did little to overturn the sell-off, which was exacerbated after the PBoC weakened the reference rate which pressured CNH to a record low against the greenback past the 7.0000 level seen by some to be a sticking-point for China and raises concerns of China weaponizing its currency.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback slightly softened and dipped below the 98.00 level, although its major transatlantic counterparts failed to take advantage amid the widespread risk averse tone with EUR/USD and GBP/USD choppy at the 1.1100 and 1.2100 handles respectively. Conversely, JPY strengthened on safe-haven flows which pressured USD/JPY to below the 106.00 handle for the first time since the flash crash at the beginning of the year, while USD/CNH surged above the psychological key 7.0000 level and briefly to the 7.1100 handle for the first time ever after a softer reference rate setting by the PBoC which further spooked investor sentiment and in turn, weighed on antipodeans due to their high-beta properties and heavy China exposure.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned as the widespread risk averse tone spurred safe-haven buying which also lifted T-notes overnight, while the BoJ are present in the market today under its massive bond buying program.</p>",
