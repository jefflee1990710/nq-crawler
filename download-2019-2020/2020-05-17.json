Furthermore, President Trump commented that he has lost a little flavour for the China trade deal but separately noted 2021 will be a great year from an economic standpoint and that the US is ready to begin moving forward, while he was also said to mull making the funding cut for the WHO permanent. (Newswires)</p><p>US House on Friday narrowly passed the new USD 3tln coronavirus stimulus relief bill which was largely along party lines with the vote count at 208-199. (Newswires)</p><p>US House Ways and Means Committee’s Brady said tax incentives that accelerate return of production lines to the US from China are a pretty smart thing to do and that payroll tax holiday is better than another round of direct cheques to Americans.

(Newswires)</p><p>Italy’s government approved the decree to lift some coronavirus-related restrictions beginning this Monday, while facilities such as gyms, swimming pools and sports centres will reopen from May 25th although travel between regions will remain banned until June 3rd.

The US is moving to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors (SOX) and chipsets made using US software/technology.

There had initially been a bid in the complex in European trade amid risk off conditions induced by the latest US/Huawei restriction headlines. However, as equity futures began to recoup losses shortly after the US cash equity open, duration came under pressure, reversing the gains from overnight. The move marks a slight paring of the strong bull-flattening seen through the record Treasury refunding auction this week and perhaps was part due to some position unwinding as we head into the weekend. Furthermore, the new USD 20bln 20-year auction looms on the horizon (scheduled for Wednesday), with today’s modest rate back-up perhaps some concession ahead of the new coupon for the market to digest – although if this week was anything to go by, demand for duration has been solid. Note also that the Fed cut its daily USTs/TIPS purchases for the week ahead again - USD 6bln from 7bln – but the curve was little changed post the announcement, where duration had already modestly sold off ahead of the release. US T-note futures (M0) settled 3 ticks lower at 139-10+.</p>",
