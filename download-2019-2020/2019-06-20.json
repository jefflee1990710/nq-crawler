Debate remains over whether the drone was flying in Iranian airspace or not, where IRGC Commander Salami said the downing of the drone sent a clear message to Washington that Tehran will react strongly against any acts of aggression in its borders. However, the US state that the drone was flying in international airspace. US President Trump since said that Iran had made a very big mistake, and later convened with military generals, as well as holding a briefing with congressional leaders. Later, when asked if the US will strike Iran, US President Trump said \"you'll soon find out\" although in the same interview he opted to dial back the rhetoric somewhat, saying he does not feel like his administration is pushing him toward conflict and in some cases it’s just the opposite, whilst suggesting that the drone shooter could have been someone who was “loose and stupid”.</p><p><strong>* FOMC</strong> <strong>– SIZE OF RATE CUT IS NOW THE QUESTION:</strong> With markets pricing a July rate cut with over 100% certainty, the question is now shifting towards whether the Fed will trim rates by 25bps, or by 50bps. Fed chair Powell on Wednesday cited research which suggested it might be better to cut by a larger margin in order to prevent any prolonged weakness, though stopped short of committing to any size, saying the FOMC have not discussed the increment. Desks have suggested that it could put the Fed in an awkward position: if markets are expecting a cut of 50bps, a cut of 25bps may disappoint by 25bps.</p><p><strong>* US PHILLY FED INDEX: </strong>The US Philly Fed Business Index came in at 0.3 for the month of June, well below the consensus for 11.0 and May print of 16.6. Pantheon Macroeconomics note they are not surprised by the Philly Fed index for May plunging to 0.3 (prev. 16.6). They cite the plunge in the Empire State index as being an indication that the Philly Fed consensus was unrealistic given that both surveys were taken during the Mexico tariff episode. The consultancy highlights the index’s volatility due to trade developments, but the more stable new orders and employment components fell by a more modest 2.7 and 2.8 points respectively.</p><p><strong>* BOE REVIEW: </strong>Despite some minor outside bets for hawkish dissent on the MPC, policymakers opted once again to stand pat on rates at 0.75% via a unanimous vote. This week’s meeting took place against a backdrop of MPC members hammering home to markets that rate rises will be coming at a faster pace than currently priced in the market (Aug 2020 is currently showing 11bps of tightening), however, these hawkish impulses didn’t see any particular airing this week other than the statement retaining its guidance that “rates will be raised at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”. In fact, the tone of the statement held a relatively cautious slant with the MPC noting that “downside risks to growth have increased”; citing global trade tensions and the increasing risk of a no deal Brexit. This sentiment was also reflected in the Bank’s decision to cut their Q2 GDP forecast to flat from a prior view of +0.2%. On the Brexit front, policymakers opted to maintain guidance that “the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction”, in what was otherwise a relatively tame release. Overall, ING concludes “we wouldn’t totally rule out a rate hike from the Bank of England later this year if wage growth continues to perform solidly and the immediate threat from Brexit recedes”. However, the Dutch Bank ultimately concedes that “it is unlikely the Bank will hike rates this year”.</p><p><strong>* BOJ REVIEW: </strong>The BOJ kept all policy settings unchanged; as major global&nbsp; central banks pivot dovish, some were expecting the BOJ to provide some clear signals that it could follow the dovish trend, particularly in wake of Governor Kuroda’s recent comments where he reiterated that the BOJ had scope to ease policy further to achieve its inflation goals. “Strong domestic fundamentals continue to offset the negative shocks from uncertainties overseas,” Societe Generale said, “economic data continues to show strength in the domestic economy,” and under such circumstances, the bank says the BOJ is likely to maintain the view that it could continue to wait for further data and developments. SocGen’s central scenario is that the BOJ will keep rates unchanged until 2021, after the Tokyo Olympic games: “That said, if risks to achieving the 2% inflation target strengthen, then BOJ policy board members could give more indications that it would be ready to act if needed, following the recent trend of global central bankers,” SocGen argues.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>In what was familiar rhetoric, Italian PM Conte reiterated criticisms of EU fiscal rules; saying that rules should focus on growth, whilst also criticising partners for unfair tax advantages and for running excessive surpluses (Netherlands and<strong> </strong>Germany).</p><p><strong>* UK: </strong>There are now suggestions that Conservative Leadership candidate frontrunner Boris Johnson would mull early elections, in the event he wins the keys to Downing Street; the Johnson team feels that a charismatic leader could win an outright majority vs Labour. Boris Johnson subsequently maintained his lead in latest conservative leadership ballot rounds, with Michael Gove and Sajid Javid eliminated, leaving Jeremy Hunt as the only remaining challenger to the favourite.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Largely a reiteration of ECB President Draghi comments on Tuesday: ECB's de Guindos (Neutral) said the Bank is ready to act if the deterioration continues, whilst, in the same vein, ECB's Knot suggested the bank is actively thinking about emergency plans in the event that growth does not pick up.</p><p><strong>* NORGES BANK REVIEW: </strong>The Norges Bank unanimously delivered on the 25bps June hike, with the Key Rate now at 1.25%, as expected.” Governor Olsen highlighted that the “assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely be increased further in the course of 2019”, as Governor Olsen noted that the rate path suggests a September hike followed by an additional hike before Summer 2020. In-fitting with some of the house calls, the rate path was left unchanged from the March release. Overall, the statement painted an upbeat picture of the economy and outlook; “Underlying inflation is a little higher than the inflation target”, “Growth in the Norwegian economy is solid, and capacity utilisation is estimated to be somewhat above a normal level. The NB did however acknowledge that a deepening in trade tensions and softer oil prices could weigh on the domestic economy. All-in-all a hawkish hike, which was reflected by the markets as EUR/NOK slid from around 9.7240 to 6.6700.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Governor Lowe argued that there was a “fair degree” of spare capacity in the labour market, while recent data, including the labour market report and GDP data did not suggest that any inroads were being made in terms of eroding this spare capacity; accordingly, Lowe said that it was “not unreasonable” to expect further easing from the central bank. Some had argued that the recent meeting minutes have opened up the door to potential QE in the future. However, some analysts noted that Lowe reiterated that monetary, fiscal and micro policy were all “options” (e said the word three times in the speech); given that the RBA’s Bulletin did not have any guidance on QE “options” (the Bulletin did not contain any article laying the foundation to QE), some have suggested that it was a deliberate attempt by the governor to play down potential QE. Others have noted that in 2007-2011, the central bank made use of open market operations (FX forwards and repos) to ease conditions, making it likely it could explore this tool again.</p><p><strong>* </strong><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/wti-futures-q9-settle-usd-3-10-higher-at-usd-57-07-bbl-brent-futures-q9-settle-usd-2-63-higher-at-usd-64-45-bbl-20-06-2019\">WTI futures (Q9) settle USD 3.10 higher at USD 57.07/bbl; Brent futures (Q9) settle USD 2.63 higher at USD 64.45/BBL</a><strong>:</strong> A perfect storm of geopolitical risk and a Fed induced appetite for risk (and, as a result, the weaker USD) saw the crude complex surge on Thursday. Prices were initially on the front foot as market participants digested the FOMC meeting, which lead to rising expectations of near-term US interest rate cuts, seeing US equities reach new all time highs. On top of this, the geopolitical risk premium became more pronounced after a US drone was shot down by Iran, helping crude markets rally further on supply concerns out of the oil-rich region. It is worth noting that although WTI did outperform its European counterpart, part of this would be a factor of the July WTI future contract expiring. Analysts at Citigroup on the near-term crude outlook said, “At least for the moment, we see no immediate bearish fundamental to counterbalance this bullish combination.”</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 128-02: </strong>The T-plex continued to trade higher on Thursday, sending yields even lower, in the wake of a now non-patient Fed with an eye for rate cuts. The Fed-sensitive front end of the curve saw the most bidding seeing the 2-year yield drop c. 3bps at settlement. The curve itself saw some modest flattening where the 2s/10s contracted by c. 2bps. The US also sold USD 15bln in 5-year TIPS on Thursday at a high yield of 0.152%, with a chunky indirects takedown (75.73%), a B/C of 2.55x, and tailing by 0.2bps.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1% at 2954, NASDAQ-100 0.9% at 7738, Dow Jones 0.9% at 26754, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.7%, Consumer Staples 0.8%, Energy 2.2%, Financials&nbsp; 0.5%, Health Care 0.4%, Industrials 1.6%, Information Technology 1.4%, Materials 1.2%, Telecommunication Services 0.6%, Utilities 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Oracle (ORCL) jumped higher after reporting earnings that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Newmont Goldcorp (NEM) moved higher as the Gold rally. Petro names, including ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) moved higher as oil prices rallied on geopolitical tensions. On which note, airlines, including Delta Airlines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were also under pressure as fuel prices rose. However, the outlook for vacations consumption may also have weighed, after Carnival Corp (CCL) sunk on poor earnings guidance dragging Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) with it. Tesla (TSLA) was under pressure after Goldman reduced its PT for the electric automaker. Darden Restaurants (DRI) pared the worst of losses sustained pre-market, after the co missed revenue expectations and cut guidance. Hershey (HSY) was under pressure after being downgraded to hold from neutral at Piper Jaffray. Dell Technologies (DELL) moved higher after being initiated with a buy at Deutsche Bank. Perrigo (PRGO) came under some late session selling on reports that interest for its RX unit had faded.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> continued its decline as the market continued to digest yesterday’s dovish FOMC, and was the worst G10 performer, with markets now seemingly split over whether the next Fed move will be a 50bps or 25bps rate cut, rather than split over whether or not there will even be a rate cut. On the other side coin, <strong>EUR</strong> was strong, moving back towards 1.1300 while Gold (<strong>XAU)</strong> has continued its rally, edging closer to USD 1400. Across the channel, the BoE maintained its hiking bias, but the minutes came across dovish, especially when compared with recent comments from Saunders, Haldane and Carney. As such <strong>GBP</strong> came off somewhat, EURGBP moving as high as 0.8920 on the day, before paring gains to consolidate around 0.8880. <strong>JPY</strong> was largely unaffected by the BoJ who opted to stand pat, and traded much more as a function of the weakening dollar and global risk appetite; USDJPY broke out of the bottom of the June range, where losses had previously been capped at 107.80 (on USD weakness), before a further bout of downside triggered by a certain Trump tweet (“Iran has made a very big mistake”) saw the pair move as low as 107.25. Likewise, <strong>CHF</strong> was also significantly stronger, with dovish ECB talk, Italian fiscal jitters and disappointing Eurozone survey news doing little to help. Indeed, EURCHF fell below 1.1100, a level that some analysts have suggested may be a line in the sand for the SNB. <strong>NOK</strong> was a G10 outperformer, as the Norges Bank went further than delivering the expected 25 bps hike, pencilling in 2 more hikes, likely in this September and before Summer 2020. As such, EURNOK broke back below 9.7000 and continues to make headway toward 9.6500. Elsewhere on the CB policy front; dovish comments from RBA’s Lowe, in which he hinted at the need for further rate cuts, resulted in temporary downside for the <strong>AUD</strong>, however losses were capped, as <strong>antipodeans</strong> continued to rally on the dollar’s demise and improved optimism for a US/China trade deal. AUDUSD moved back above 0.69 while NZDUSD advanced toward 0.66 (from lows of 0.6490 earlier in the week). <strong>EMFX</strong> rallied as the dollar came off. <strong>ZAR</strong> was relatively unmoved during a SOTU from SA President Ramaphosa and was relatively subdued after a rather downbeat ratings outlook from Fitch, with USDZAR consolidating around 14.3000. <strong>TRY</strong> fared slightly better in wake of a rise in Turkish consumer confidence and despite more interjections from President Erdogan on the Russian S-400 missile front (done deal and order to arrive early next month), which caused a brief bout of downside. Note also, he repeated that benchmark rates should be lower in similar vein to his US peer, but USDTRY remains capped ahead of 5.8000, albeit off lows under 5.7300.</p>",

On the other side coin, <strong>EUR</strong> was strong, moving back towards 1.1300 while Gold (<strong>XAU)</strong> has continued its rally, edging closer to USD 1400. Across the channel, the BoE maintained its hiking bias, but the minutes came across dovish, especially when compared with recent comments from Saunders, Haldane and Carney.

AUDUSD moved back above 0.69 while NZDUSD advanced toward 0.66 (from lows of 0.6490 earlier in the week). <strong>EMFX</strong> rallied as the dollar came off. <strong>ZAR</strong> was relatively unmoved during a SOTU from SA President Ramaphosa and was relatively subdued after a rather downbeat ratings outlook from Fitch, with USDZAR consolidating around 14.3000. <strong>TRY</strong> fared slightly better in wake of a rise in Turkish consumer confidence and despite more interjections from President Erdogan on the Russian S-400 missile front (done deal and order to arrive early next month), which caused a brief bout of downside.

Prices were initially on the front foot as market participants digested the FOMC meeting, which lead to rising expectations of near-term US interest rate cuts, seeing US equities reach new all time highs. On top of this, the geopolitical risk premium became more pronounced after a US drone was shot down by Iran, helping crude markets rally further on supply concerns out of the oil-rich region. It is worth noting that although WTI did outperform its European counterpart, part of this would be a factor of the July WTI future contract expiring. Analysts at Citigroup on the near-term crude outlook said, “At least for the moment, we see no immediate bearish fundamental to counterbalance this bullish combination.”</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/NOK/JPY/AUD/USD</strong></p><p>All under the influence of, if not totally transfixed on CB policy or guidance as the BoE maintained a tightening bias, but added some provisos that countered recent more hawkish remarks from certain MPC members. Conversely, the Norges Bank stuck to its script when delivering another 25 bp hike and went several steps further by pencilling in 2 more ¼ point tightening moves, like in September this year and before Summer 2020. The Bank added that is rate path signals a slightly faster pace of normalisation than in March based on a robust domestic economy vs downside risks elsewhere and softer oil prices. Elsewhere, the BoJ maintained that powerful stimulus is needed to meet the inflation target and if that objective is threatened then more measure will be implemented, while RBA’s Lowe reaffirmed the case for more easing. Earlier, the Fed removed patience from its statement and dots within the SEP to pave the way for a potential or probable cut at the July FOMC. Moreover, with 7 members now plotting looser policy in H2 this year and those remaining unchanged to keep the 2019 consensus flat said to be more open to easing, according to Chair Powell, the size of a move could be bigger than the standard 25 bp. Hence, the Buck has been the net loser with Cable up to circa 1.2725 at one stage and only crimped by soft UK retail sales and the aforementioned not as hawkish BoE minutes and vote than some anticipated. Usd/Nok and Eur/Nok hit lows sub-8.5400 and 9.6600 respectively before consolidating, while the Yen finally breached 108.00 and support just under the big figure on its way down to 107.50, as the Aussie managed to stay mostly above 0.6900 in large part due to the Greenback’s demise. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> is teetering just above 96.500 and post-NFP lows with additional pressure from a bleak Philly Fed survey and increasingly strained US-Iran relations following a drone said to have been downed by the IRGC, which Tehran contends was violating boundaries, but Washington insists was in international airspace.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Aside from the Usd weakness noted above, the Loonie derived some momentum from spiking crude prices to offset a fall in Canadian ADP and extended post-CPI gains to circa 1.3150 at best, while the Kiwi almost touched 0.6600 on the back of encouraging NZ GDP overnight and Franc got close to 0.9800 after a wider than previous Swiss trade surplus with watch exports rebounding strongly. Note, Eur/Chf has retreated further from 1.1200+ recently to under 1.1100, as the single currency failed to sustain gains above 1.1300 vs the Dollar amidst more dovish ECB talk, Italian fiscal jitters and disappointing Eurozone survey news.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Rand is treading cautiously ahead of the SOTU from SA President Ramaphosa (from around 18.00BST) and after a rather downbeat ratings outlook from Fitch, with Usd/Zar back above 14.3000 vs sub-14.2000 earlier in the session, but the Lira fares slightly better in wake of a rise in Turkish consumer confidence and despite more interjections from President Erdogan on the Russian S-400 missile front (done deal and order to arrive early next month). Note also, he repeated that benchmark rates should be lower in similar vein to his US peer, but Usd/Try remains capped ahead of 5.8000, albeit some way off lows under 5.7300.</p>",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) was led higher by gold names after the precious metal surged to its highest since 2013 but with upside in the broader market capped by weakness in other miners including Rio Tinto after it lowered its iron ore production outlook and with Caltex heavily pressured on disappointing guidance due to extraordinary challenges in H1. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was also supported in the aftermath of the FOMC although a firmer currency and unsurprising BoJ announcement limited the advances, while Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.5%) outperformed on optimism ahead of the US-China trade talks and as financials surged after continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes amid a decline in global yields with the US 10yr yield below 2.00% for the first time since November 2016 and with the 30yr yield also at similar multi-year lows.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive as the region digests the dovish FOMC in which the Fed kept rates unchanged as expected but dropped its ‘patient’ reference and lowered rate projections from end-2020 through to the longer-term. Fed Chair Powell also suggested that many participants see a strong case for rate cuts and that even for the participants that don’t, the case for accommodation was stronger now than previously. As such, ASX 200 (+0.4%) was led higher by gold names after the precious metal surged to its highest since 2013 but with upside in the broader market capped by weakness in other miners including Rio Tinto after it lowered its iron ore production forecasts and with Caltex heavily pressured on disappointing guidance due to extraordinary challenges in H1. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was also supported in the aftermath of the FOMC although a firmer currency and looming BoJ announcement limited the advances, while Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) conformed to the upbeat tone following another liquidity effort by the PBoC and optimism ahead of the US-China trade talks at the G20.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY weakened and fell below the 97.00 level in the wake of the FOMC which saw markets price in 29.5bps of cuts for July (Prev. 24.9bps) and 71.5bps of cuts priced by end-2019 (Prev. 60.5bps), despite Fed Chair Powell stopping short of declaring a cut for July and instead reverted back to the “monitoring” language when asked about a cut for next month. This benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts across the board with EUR/USD and GBP/USD extending above 1.1250 and 1.2650 respectively, while USD/JPY slipped below 108.00 to its weakest levels since January. Elsewhere, antipodeans were also underpinned by the Fed and with gains in NZD/USD exacerbated by better than expected Q1 GDP, although AUD/USD began to consolidate after hitting resistance at the 0.6900 handle and on cross-related flows in which AUD/NZD slipped below 1.0500.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes amid a decline in yields with the US 10yr yield below 2.00% which is its lowest level since November 2016 and with the 30yr yield also at similar multi-year lows. Gold was another notable mover overnight and briefly spiked by around 2.5% higher on the session to levels last seen in 2013 due to the softer greenback and which some attributed to stops being triggered after a breakout of a 5-year range.&nbsp;</p>",
