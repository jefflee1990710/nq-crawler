The proposal would aim to eliminate the trade difference between the two side by 2024 which stood at around USD 323bln in 2018. Nonetheless, US trade negotiators appeared to be sceptical of the offer. Elsewhere, the EU Commission has proposed negotiating mandates for trade talks with the US seeking cover tariff removal for industrial goods and regulatory cooperation. EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom announced that they are ready to put cars into the negotiations but clarified that they are not proposing to restart broad free trade agreements with the US; they warned that if the US imposes car tariffs, the EU would stand ready with counter-measures. In related comments, German Economy Minister Altmaier noted that the goal of EU-US trade talks is to bring down trade barriers and build new transatlantic trade ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Market participants now await UK PM May appearance in the House of Commons (21st January) for any clarity on how she will attempt to overcome the slew of hurdles in her way, but markets have been provided with little in the way of clarity on what move UK PM May will make next. With a distinct lack of support from her own party, PM May had been expected to find a cross-party solution, however, as it stands, UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn is unwilling to engage in talks. She has also reached out to European leaders with the aim to find a compromise that can be put forward in Parliament; on Friday, a spokesperson announced that the PM has ruled out a snap general election and will be holding further talks with EU leaders through the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Hawkish) tilted to the dovish side highlighting that the Fed needs &quot;prudence, patience and good judgement&quot; and highlighting that the Fed will adjust policy if conditions are less robust. He does not see inflation pressures building &nbsp;up and sees it at 2% this year while he predicts GDP growth between 2-2.5%; he stated that the motto of data dependence is now more relevant than ever. He said the Fed will reassess their balance sheet policy if conditions change while tail winds have lost gust and rates are closer to normal. He warned that the govt shutdown will have a significant impact on Q1 growth and that uncertainty in the economy has increased significantly. He would not see inversion of yield curve as recessionary sign. Fed&#39;s Harker (Non-Voter, Dovish) stated that the US economy is doing well overall, employers need to think creatively to combat workforce gaps in a tight labour market. Fed&#39;s Daly (Non-Voter, Dovish) is leaning toward pausing on interest rate hikes for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>The White House announced that the US continues to make progress with North Korea, though sanctions will remain, and reported that Trump is planning a second summit with North Korea at the end of February. US President Trump met with North Korean envoy today and had a constructive meeting while the US State Department reported that Pompeo and Special Representative Biegun also &quot;had a good discussion&quot; with the North Korean envoy on efforts for progress on commitments made at the Singapore summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</strong> fell to 0.3% from 0.6%, slightly above the 0.2% consensus, boosting capacity utilisation to 78.7% the highest since January 2015. Overall a solid report. Production was supported by manufacturing, mining and coal production slightly offset by a fall in utility due to the warm weather in December. Nonetheless, Pantheon notes that the strength cannot last given that &ldquo;the ISM and other surveys point clearly to a sharp slowing in output growth, to the point where we would not be surprised to see the sector in recession in the spring&rdquo; amid the trade war with China. They also add that &ldquo;the drop in utility output will be reflected in a sharp drop in consumers&rsquo; real spending on energy in December, pulling perhaps 0.15% from total real consumption&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* UNI OF MICHIGHAN</strong> fell to 90.7 from 98.3, missing significantly the 96.8 consensus. Analysts at Pantheon argue that the small increase in the consensus did not make sense given the government shutdown and the lagged effect of stock prices. Despite the decline, sentiment remains elevated and reinforces solid growth in consumption. Also adding to positive sentiment, &ldquo;the rebound in stocks in recent weeks suggests that a further big drop in sentiment is unlikely&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADA CPI </strong>posted at 0.2% in December rising from -0.2% in November, pushing the y/y headline to 2.0% above the 1.7% consensus. Looking at the breakdown, the boost was due to holiday season effects reflected in air transport and travel tours prices which helped offsetting the falling oil prices. ING expects &ldquo;the downward trend of headline inflation to resume in the first part of 2019&rdquo; as the fall in energy prices continues to feed through. Despite inflation hitting the 2%, the headline has remained stable around this level and therefore the BoC should stand pat on rates at least until July; ING argues &ldquo;the next hiking opportunity would probably be in April when a new monetary policy report is published, but we think a third quarter hike is more likely, as it allows the BoC to wait for confirmation that the Fed is still in hiking mode&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.73 HIGHER AT UD 53.80/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE UP USD 1.52 AT USD 62.70/BBL. </strong>Friday saw crude prices move higher with thanks to improved US-China trade sentiment. A sources story reported that China is to offer a path to eliminate the US trade imbalance which lifted oil in late morning trade. The IEA monthly report also showed a fall in oil supply in December by 950k BPD and maintained its oil demand estimate at 1.4mln BPD; however Russia increased its production ahead of the planned cuts. Baker Hughes Rig Count (18/Jan): oil rigs down 21 at 852, nat gas down 4 at 198, total down 25 at 1050 (prev. 1075).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.36% at 2672, NASDAQ +0.98% at 6785, DJI +1.41% at 24713. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.99%, Materials +1.76%, Industrials +1.97%, Cons Discretionary +1.32%, Cons Staples +1.26%, Healthcare +1.26%, Financials +1.76%, Tech +1.52%, Telecoms +0.53%, Utilities +0.28%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) was the first FAANG stock to report for the quarter, where it disappointed investors on revenue expectations, domestic subscriber additions as well as reporting a deepened negative FCF. Semiconductors (MU, AMAT, NVDA) outperformed, helped by reports China is to ramp up US imports; other trade sensitive stocks Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) also benefitted. Apple (AAPL) moved higher with market even though its largest supplier Foxconn was reported to have cut 50,000 jobs due to faltering iPhone demand. Schlumberger (SLB) outperformed after beating revenue estimates. VF Corp (VFC) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates; American Express (AXP) underperformed after missing them. Tesla (TSLA) nosedived on the back of Musk announcing a 7% cut in its total staff. Eli Lilly (LLY) dragged down healthcare after unsuccessful results from a Phase 3 drug trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 11 TICKS LOWER AT 121-05+.</strong> Investors moved away from treasuries on Friday as sentiment improved on hopes that US and China are making progress in talks. Solid manufacturing output also placed downward pressure on the complex. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end of the curve where yields were higher by c.5 bps at settlement. The yield curve saw some modest bear flattening heading into the long weekend as US markets will remain closed on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> Overall a positive week for the buck as DXY is poised to snap a four-week losing streak as the index kicked off the week sub-96.000 at 95.650 and reached highs of 96.260 (vs. low 95.50). Catalysts in the form of data remained on the light side as the US government shutdown hit day 28. The initial bout of dollar demand came alongside comments from US Senator Grassley who highlighted little progress in US-Sino trade talks on key sticking points such as IP, citing USTR Lighthizer. As such DXY rose to print the weekly high of 96.260. Furthermore, gains were exacerbated amid reports that US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against Huawei due to theft of trade secrets, while separate reports stated that US lawmakers are attempting to pass a bill to ban chip sales to Huawei and ZTE. In a response, China strongly urged US lawmakers not to pass this bill. The intensifying tensions between the two countries provided further impetus for the dollar to test support at the weekly high before CNBC reported that the US is mulling rolling back tariffs to break the deadlock between dialogue, although those reports were later denied by the Treasury. Throughout most of Friday&rsquo;s session, DXY hovered around its 100 DMA around 96.050 before optimistic industrial production figures sent the index closer to the top of the intraday range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Another rollercoaster week for the Pound, but ultimately on course to end on a strong note after Cable fluctuated in a weekly range of 1.2668-1.3000. As a recap, heading into the PM May&rsquo;s meaningful vote, Cable fell to around 1.2700 just shy of the weekly low of 1.2670. Immediately after the results in which PM May was defeated by 230 votes, the currency pair spiked higher amid hopes that Article 50 will be extended past March 29th as PM May attempts to conjure up a revised deal with the EU or face a hard-Brexit which is unfavoured by most UK MPs. However, the EU made it clear that renegotiations will not be open, while Commons leader Leadsom mentioned that the UK Government is not looking to postpone the Brexit date. Furthermore, Labour leader Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence against the Premier as previously touted, though the PM won the vote of confidence by 19 votes, as expected. In terms of a market reaction, Cable fell through the &ldquo;meaningful vote low&rdquo; to the weekly low of 1.2670 before sharply paring back losses to test 1.3000 to the upside before coming off highs, with downside in the pair exacerbated amid the release of disappointing retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Overall a dismal week for the antipodeans as the week kicked off with disappointing Chinese trade data imports and exports both decline to a 6-month low (in USD terms) which pressured the high-beta currencies. Throughout the week, the Aussie and Kiwi were further hit by the aforenoted US-Sino IP stalemate alongside Huawei tensions. The two currencies however experienced trade-relief gains amidst the reports of China tariff rollbacks. AUD/USD flirted around 0.7200 throughout most of the week in a range of 0.7190-0.7226 while NZD/USD underperformed and fell further below 0.6850 and is poised to end the week nearer to the middle of 0.6728-0.6848 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR: </strong>A downbeat week for the Japanese currency amid a firmer buck and alongside and unwind in risk premium towards the end of the week. USD/JPY is poised to end the week closer to the top of a weekly 108.00-109.60 range. Meanwhile EUR moved largely in tandem with the rising dollar, though the German annual GDP release did marginally dent the single currency. EUR/USD is set to end the week on the backfoot and more towards the bottom of a 1.1370-1.1490 weekly range ahead of the ECB interest rate decision next week where focus will be on the EZ growth outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Monday: </strong>Germany Gfk Consumer Confidence, China GDP &amp; Retail Sales.

        "subject": "FX Weekly Wrap: Dollar remains King, but Sterling steals the limelight ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Overall a positive week for the buck as DXY is poised to snap a four-week losing streak as the index kicked off the week sub-96.000 at 95.650 and reached highs of 96.260 (vs. low 95.50). Catalysts in the form of data remained on the light side as the US government shutdown hit day 28. The initial bout of dollar demand came alongside comments from US Senator Grassley who highlighted little progress in US-Sino trade talks on key sticking points such as IP, citing USTR Lighthizer. As such DXY rose to print the weekly high of 96.260. Furthermore, gains were exacerbated amid reports that US prosecutors are to pursue criminal charges against Huawei due to theft of trade secrets, while separate reports stated that US lawmakers are attempting to pass a bill to ban chip sales to Huawei and ZTE. In a response, China strongly urged US lawmakers not to pass this bill. The intensifying tensions between the two countries provided further impetus for the dollar to test support at the weekly high before CNBC reported that the US is mulling rolling back tariffs to break the deadlock between dialogue, although those reports were later denied by the Treasury. Throughout most of Friday&rsquo;s session, DXY hovered around its 100 DMA around 96.050 before optimistic industrial production figures sent the index closer to the top of the intraday range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong> &ndash; Another rollercoaster week for the Pound, but ultimately on course to end on a strong note after Cable fluctuated in a weekly range of 1.2668-1.3000. As a recap, heading into the PM May&rsquo;s meaningful vote, Cable fell to around 1.2700 just shy of the weekly low of 1.2670. Immediately after the results in which PM May was defeated by 230 votes, the currency pair spiked higher amid hopes that Article 50 will be extended past March 29th as PM May attempts to conjure up a revised deal with the EU or face a hard-Brexit which is unfavoured by most UK MPs. However, the EU made it clear that renegotiations will not be open, while Commons leader Leadsom mentioned that the UK Government is not looking to postpone the Brexit date. Furthermore, Labour leader Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence against the Premier as previously touted, though the PM won the vote of confidence by 19 votes, as expected. In terms of a market reaction, Cable fell through the &ldquo;meaningful vote low&rdquo; to the weekly low of 1.2670 before sharply paring back losses to test 1.3000 to the upside before coming off highs, with downside in the pair exacerbated amid the release of disappointing retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD </strong>&ndash; Overall a dismal week for the antipodeans as the week kicked off with disappointing Chinese trade data imports and exports both decline to a 6-month low (in USD terms) which pressured the high-beta currencies. Throughout the week, the Aussie and Kiwi were further hit by the aforenoted US-Sino IP stalemate alongside Huawei tensions. The two currencies however experienced trade-relief gains amidst the reports of China tariff rollbacks. AUD/USD flirted around 0.7200 throughout most of the week in a range of 0.7190-0.7226 while NZD/USD underperformed and fell further below 0.6850 and is poised to end the week nearer to the middle of 0.6728-0.6848 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY, EUR</strong> &ndash; A downbeat week for the Japanese currency amid a firmer buck and alongside and unwind in risk premium towards the end of the week. USD/JPY is poised to end the week closer to the top of a weekly 108.00-109.60 range. Meanwhile EUR moved largely in tandem with the rising dollar, though the German annual GDP release did marginally dent the single currency. EUR/USD is set to end the week on the backfoot and more towards the bottom of a 1.1370-1.1490 weekly range ahead of the ECB interest rate decision next week where focus will be on the EZ growth outlook.</p>\r\n",

UK 10-year futures still marginally outperform their German counterparts, but remain in negative territory for the day, with the UK benchmark a shade under the 122.40 level. This comes after the DUP refuted assertions that they were backing a Norway style deal alongside assertions from UK PM May that a snap election has been ruled out ahead of the Plan B presentation on Monday. In the periphery, BTP 10-year futures were dealt a blow by the Bank of Italy downgrading their 2019 growth forecasts to 0.6% from 1.0% but are the outperformer in Europe and trade with gains of 25 ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US 10-year futures equalled but failed to break the December 28th low of 121-09 to the downside in the European morning and remain in the red for the session, as the positive trade developments remain the largest catalyst for moves in the fixed income sector. Inspiring industrial production data from the US pressured 10-yr futures to trade a hair above session lows of 121-09, with the University of Michigan Sentiment reading up next. Largely reiterated comments by Fed&rsquo;s Williams failed to have a sustained impact on US fixed income, with Harker next on the docket.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) were positive with broad gains across the sectors and with the Japanese benchmark the outperformer as it coat-tailed on the favourable currency moves. Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) were boosted by the trade hopes with US and China also said to be in discussions on reopening access for US poultry exports to China, while the PBoC&rsquo;s continued efforts this week resulted to a substantial net weekly injection of CNY 1.16tln to the interbank market. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as they tracked the downside in T-notes and with demand for bonds subdued by the positive sentiment across stock markets in the region, but with losses limited amid improved demand in the enhanced liquidity auction for 10yr, 20yr &amp; 30yr JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected a total CNY 20bln today for a weekly net injection of CNY 1.16tln vs. Prev.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour MPs have accepted the Premier&rsquo;s invitation to cross-party talks, defying party leader Corbyn&rsquo;s demands for no talks until a no-deal scenario is off the table (Twitter/Times).

MPs are to vote on this amendment on January 29th.

Trade Commissioner Malmstrom added that EU are ready to put cars into the negotiations with the US; we are not proposing to restart broad free trade agreements with the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German government spokesman, when asked about mulling the ban of Huawei from its 5G network, said security is important for Germany. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are firmly in the green amidst positive trade updates [Euro Stoxx 50 +1.6%]. FTSE MIB (+1.0%) was initially weighed on by the poor performance of index heavyweight Telecom Italia (-7.0%) at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after saying they expect 2018 organic EBITDA of domestic business unit to be in the lower mid-single digits compared to the previous year; adding that this may influence 2019. Major sectors are similarly in the green with some underperformance in telecom names on the back of aforementioned Telecom Italia. Other notable movers include Casino (+6.6%) after the Co&rsquo;s CFO states that despite the French protests they expect to meet 2018 profit goals. Ryanair (-1.7%) have dropped to their lowest level in around 4 years as the Co. have cut their full year guidance. Easyjet (-2.4%) have been dealt a double blow this morning suffering from the Ryanair guidance cut and a downgrade at JP Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foxconn have cut 50k jobs at their iPhone factory since October, the scale of the cut is not necessarily deeper than prior years but it is significantly earlier; according to Nikkei citing industry sources. (Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla (TSLA) are said to cut full-time employee headcount by 7% and are to increase production with the aim of getting a Model 3 starting price to USD 35k. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Little changed and within a tight 96.000-140 band following yesterday&rsquo;s volatile trade amid reports that the US are said to be mulling rolling back on China trade tariffs in an attempt to break the stalemate in talks, although the Treasury was quick to downplay the prospects regarding this. Furthermore, participants will be eyeing the meeting between US President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin at 17:45 GMT for any fresh details on trade or the government shutdown. DXY keeps its head above 96.000 and north of its 100 DMA at 96.055 ahead of the US industrial production data. Wells Fargo notes that a solid print in December IP would show that the industrial sector remains stable, while &ldquo;a weaker print, on the other hand, may further stoke fears surrounding ongoing trade tensions and Fed policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; The table has turned for the Pound after yesterday&rsquo;s climb to test 1.3000 to the upside amid continued hopes of an Article 50 extension with reports stating that the EU are prepared to delay Brexit until at least July. In terms of the latest, the Northern Irish DUP party is reportedly leaning towards a Norway-style deal if it removes the threat of a NI backstop. This type of deal would essentially remove customs checks and allow for trade deals to be struck outside of the EU, though one key rule which must be accepted is the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital to and from EU and EEA member states. PM May has scheduled meetings with party leaders (ex-Labour) to find some common ground before she heads to Brussels. Labour MPs have accepted the PM&rsquo;s invitation to cross-party talks in a move which defies party leader Corbyn following his demand for a no-deal Brexit to be taken off the table before dialogue can commence. GBP/USD edged lower at the start of the EU session though further downside was seen just before the release of disappointing UK December retail sales (Y/Y 3.0% vs. Exp. 3.6%), with the ONS citing weak sales as shoppers brought forward spending for Black Friday discounts. Subsequently, Cable fell to an intraday low of 1.2930 (vs.; high 1.2993) and currently stands as the G10 underperformer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Relatively uneventful and stuck in sideways Dollar-dominated trade as EUR/USD flirts with the 1.1400 handle ahead of the ECB interest rate decision next week where focus will be on EZ growth outlook. In related news, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has cut its 2019 Euro area growth forecast to 1.1% (Prev. 1.4%) and added that balance of risks remains clearly tilted to the downside. EUR/USD remains above its 50 DMA at 1.1380 ahead of heavy option expiries for today&rsquo;s NY cut with 4bln at strikes 1.1375-1.1405 and a further 2bln between 1.1415-25 which may cap upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, JPY &ndash; The main movers from the aforementioned trade-related news as the JPY unwound risk premium and trade-proxy AUD benefitted from the heightened risk appetite. Upon the news, AUD/USD spiked to highs of 0.7221, though the downplay in reports by the Treasury sent the pair back below 0.7200 to test 0.7175 before stabilising just under its 100 HMA at 0.7188. Back to the Yen, USD/JPY was unreactive to the in-line inflation figures but tested 109.60 to the upside on the back of the trade news before consolidating around just under 109.50 ahead of 3.1bln options expiring at strike 109.00-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bund futures have kicked off the day as the European underperformer, with German 10-years languishing around lows of 163.85 after failing to keep its head above the 164.00 mark as the improved trade-driven sentiment weighs on futures. This comes after WSJ&rsquo;s reports overnight that the US&rsquo;s Chinese tariffs could be lifted in order to make headway in trade talks, despite CNBC reporting that neither Mnuchin or Lighthizer had made any reference to tariffs. On a technical standpoint, 10-year Bund traders will be eyeing the 163.48 January 9th low as the next support level to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, Gilts outperform their German counterparts but are also definitively in the red and hang near lows of 122.15 as the Brexit debacle rages on, with the DUP now reportedly leaning towards a customs union in a Norway-esque deal should the threat of a backstop on Northern Ireland be removed. The poor UK retail sales data failed to have an effect on the UK benchmark as focus firmly remains on Brexit ahead of PM May&rsquo;s Plan B presentation on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the States, UST futures are lower across the curve with most of the action in the belly following the aforementioned positive trade developments weighing on futures. This has seen 10-yr futures slide to trade in close proximity to session lows of 121-10+ with the 28th December 121-09 low eyed as the next support level to the downside. This also comes after comments from Fed&rsquo;s Evans in yesterday&rsquo;s session, who stated that the dot plot forecast for 2 hikes is reasonable, but it may be less, with Williams and Harker on the docket to speak today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.3%) and WTI (+1.4%) prices are benefitting from the positive market sentiment generated by potential US-China trade progress, currently just above USD 61/bbl and USD 52/bbl respectively. IEA&rsquo;s report maintains their global oil demand growth estimate at 1.4mln BPD, and global oil supply fell by 950k BPD in December. However, the report does highlight that Russia raised their oil production in December to 11.5mln BPD and that it is unclear when they will cut production. For context, yesterday Russian Energy Minister Novak said that Russia will try to accelerate cuts in their oil output, but that there are technical limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.5%) has suffered in the US-China stemmed positive risk environment, with the yellow metal residing towards the bottom of its USD 5/oz range. LME copper has breached USD 6000/tonne to the upside on reports stating the US are considering lifting tariffs on China; although this was swiftly downplayed. Elsewhere, spot palladium resides just below its all-time record of USD 1434.50/oz achieved on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA Report</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Maintain estimates of global oil demand growth at 1.4mln BPD, global oil supply fell by 950k BPD in December, led by lower OPEC production ahead of cuts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Russia raised oil production in Dec to 11.5mln BPD; it is unclear when Moscow will cut output</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- By mid-2019, US production will probably be higher than the capacity of Saudi or Russia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Non-OPEC oil production to slow to 1.6mln BPD from 2.6mln BPD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa and Saudi Arabia talks include ARAMCO using Saldanha oil tanks.

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20958/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are firmly in the green amidst positive trade updates [Euro Stoxx 50 +1.3%]. FTSE MIB (+0.8%) is weighed on by the poor performance of index heavyweight Telecom Italia (-7.9%) at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after saying they expect 2018 organic EBITDA of domestic business unit to be in the lower mid-single digits compared to the previous year; adding that this may influence 2019. Major sectors are similarly in the green with some underperformance in telecom names on the back of aforementioned Telecom Italia. Other notable movers include Casino (+6.8%) after the Co&rsquo;s CFO states that despite the French protests they expect to meet 2018 profit goals. Ryanair (-1.6%) have dropped to their lowest level in around 4 years as the Co. have cut their full year guidance. Easyjet (-2.5%) have been dealt a double blow this morning suffering from the Ryanair guidance cut and a downgrade at JP Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Little changed and within a tight 96.020-140 band following yesterday&rsquo;s volatile trade amid reports that the US are said to be mulling rolling&nbsp; back on China trade tariffs in an attempt to break the stalemate in talks, although the Treasury was quick to downplay the prospects regarding this. Furthermore, participants will be eyeing the meeting between US President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin at 17:45 GMT for any fresh details on trade or the government shutdown. DXY keeps its head above 96.000 and north of its 100 DMA at 96.055 ahead of the US industrial production data. Wells Fargo notes that a solid print in December IP would show that the industrial sector remains stable, while &ldquo;a weaker print, on the other hand, may further stoke fears surrounding ongoing trade tensions and Fed policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; The table has turned for the Pound after yesterday&rsquo;s climb to test 1.3000 to the upside amid continued hopes of an Article 50 extension with reports stating that the EU are prepared to delay Brexit until at least July. In terms of the latest, the Northern Irish DUP party is reportedly leaning towards a Norway-style deal if it removes the threat of a NI backstop. This type of deal would essentially remove customs checks and allow for trade deals to be struck outside of the EU, though one key rule which must be accepted is the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital to and from EU and EEA member states. PM May has scheduled meetings with party leaders (ex-Labour) to find some common ground before she heads to Brussels. Labour MPs have accepted the PM&rsquo;s invitation to cross-party talks in a move which defies party leader Corbyn following his demand for a no-deal Brexit to be taken off the table before dialogue can commence. GBP/USD edged lower at the start of the EU session though further downside was seen just before the release of disappointing UK December retail sales (Y/Y 3.0% vs. Exp. 3.6%), with the ONS citing weak sales as shoppers brought forward spending for Black Friday discounts. Subsequently, Cable fell to an intraday low of 1.2930 (vs.; high 1.2993) and currently stands as the G10 underperformer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Relatively uneventful and stuck in sideways Dollar-dominated trade as EUR/USD flirts with the 1.1400 handle ahead of the ECB interest rate decision next week where focus will be on EZ growth outlook. In related news, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has cut its 2019 Euro area growth forecast to 1.1% (Prev. 1.4%) and added that balance of risks remains clearly tilted to the downside. EUR/USD remains above its 50 DMA at 1.1380 ahead of heavy option expiries for today&rsquo;s NY cut with 4bln at strikes 1.1375-1.1405 and a further 2bln between 1.1415-25 which may cap upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, JPY &ndash; The main movers from the aforementioned trade-related news as the JPY unwound risk premium and trade-proxy AUD benefitted from the heightened risk appetite. Upon the news, AUD/USD spiked to highs of 0.7221, though the downplay in reports by the Treasury sent the pair back below 0.7200 to test 0.7175 before stabilising just under its 100 HMA at 0.7188. Back to the Yen, USD/JPY was unreactive to the in-line inflation figures but tested 109.60 to the upside on the back of the trade news before consolidating around just under 109.50 ahead of 3.1bln options expiring at strike 109.00-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bund futures have kicked off the day as the European underperformer, with German 10-years languishing around lows of 163.85 after failing to keep its head above the 164.00 mark as the improved trade-driven sentiment weighs on futures. This comes after WSJ&rsquo;s reports overnight that the US&rsquo;s Chinese tariffs could be lifted in order to make headway in trade talks, despite CNBC reporting that neither Mnuchin or Lighthizer had made any reference to tariffs. On a technical standpoint, 10-year Bund traders will be eyeing the 163.48 January 9th low as the next support level to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, Gilts outperform their German counterparts but are also definitively in the red and hang near lows of 122.15 as the Brexit debacle rages on, with the DUP now reportedly leaning towards a customs union in a Norway-esque deal should the threat of a backstop on Northern Ireland be removed. The poor UK retail sales data failed to have an effect on the UK benchmark as focus firmly remains on Brexit ahead of PM May&rsquo;s Plan B presentation on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the States, UST futures are lower across the curve with most of the action in the belly following the aforementioned positive trade developments weighing on futures. This has seen 10-yr futures slide to trade in close proximity to session lows of 121-10+ with the 28th December 121-09 low eyed as the next support level to the downside. This also comes after comments from Fed&rsquo;s Evans in yesterday&rsquo;s session, who stated that the dot plot forecast for 2 hikes is reasonable, but it may be less, with Williams and Harker on the docket to speak today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.5%) and WTI (+1.4%) prices are benefitting from the positive market sentiment generated by potential US-China trade progress, currently just above USD 61/bbl and USD 52/bbl respectively. IEA&rsquo;s report maintains their global oil demand growth estimate at 1.4mln BPD, and global oil supply fell by 950k BPD in December. However, the report does highlight that Russia raised their oil production in December to 11.5mln BPD and that it is unclear when they will cut production. For context, yesterday Russian Energy Minister Novak said that Russia will try to accelerate cuts in their oil output, but that there are technical limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.5%) has suffered in the US-China stemmed positive risk environment, with the yellow metal residing towards the bottom of its USD 5/oz range. LME copper has breached USD 6000/tonne to the upside on reports stating the US are considering lifting tariffs on China; although this was swiftly downplayed. Elsewhere, spot palladium resides just below its all-time record of USD 1434.50/oz achieved on Thursday.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Little changed and within a tight 96.020-140 band following yesterday&rsquo;s volatile trade amid reports that the US are said to be mulling rolling&nbsp; back on China trade tariffs in an attempt to break the stalemate in talks, although the Treasury was quick to downplay the prospects regarding this. Furthermore, participants will be eyeing the meeting between US President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin at 17:45 GMT for any fresh details on trade or the government shutdown. DXY keeps its head above 96.000 and north of its 100 DMA at 96.055 ahead of the US industrial production data. Wells Fargo notes that a solid print in December IP would show that the industrial sector remains stable, while &ldquo;a weaker print, on the other hand, may further stoke fears surrounding ongoing trade tensions and Fed policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong>&ndash; The table has turned for the Pound after yesterday&rsquo;s climb to test 1.3000 to the upside amid continued hopes of an Article 50 extension with reports stating that the EU are prepared to delay Brexit until at least July. In terms of the latest, the Northern Irish DUP party is reportedly leaning towards a Norway-style deal if it removes the threat of a NI backstop. This type of deal would essentially remove customs checks and allow for trade deals to be struck outside of the EU, though one key rule which must be accepted is the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital to and from EU and EEA member states. PM May has scheduled meetings with party leaders (ex-Labour) to find some common ground before she heads to Brussels. Labour MPs have accepted the PM&rsquo;s invitation to cross-party talks in a move which defies party leader Corbyn following his demand for a no-deal Brexit to be taken off the table before dialogue can commence. GBP/USD edged lower at the start of the EU session though further downside was seen just before the release of disappointing UK December retail sales (Y/Y 3.0% vs. Exp. 3.6%), with the ONS citing weak sales as shoppers brought forward spending for Black Friday discounts. Subsequently, Cable fell to an intraday low of 1.2930 (vs.; high 1.2993) and currently stands as the G10 underperformer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong>&ndash; Relatively uneventful and stuck in sideways Dollar-dominated trade as EUR/USD flirts with the 1.1400 handle ahead of the ECB interest rate decision next week where focus will be on EZ growth outlook. In related news, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has cut its 2019 Euro area growth forecast to 1.1% (Prev. 1.4%) and added that balance of risks remains clearly tilted to the downside. EUR/USD remains above its 50 DMA at 1.1380 ahead of heavy option expiries for today&rsquo;s NY cut with 4bln at strikes 1.1375-1.1405 and a further 2bln between 1.1415-25 which may cap upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, JPY</strong> &ndash; The main movers from the aforementioned trade-related news as the JPY unwound risk premium and trade-proxy AUD benefitted from the heightened risk appetite. Upon the news, AUD/USD spiked to highs of 0.7221, though the downplay in reports by the Treasury sent the pair back below 0.7200 to test 0.7175 before stabilising just under its 100 HMA at 0.7188.

This comes after WSJ&rsquo;s reports overnight that the US&rsquo;s Chinese tariffs could be lifted in order to make headway in trade talks, despite CNBC reporting that neither Mnuchin or Lighthizer had made any reference to tariffs. On a technical standpoint, 10-year Bund traders will be eyeing the 163.48 January 9th low as the next support level to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, Gilts outperform their German counterparts but are also definitively in the red and hang near lows of 122.15 as the Brexit debacle rages on, with the DUP now reportedly leaning towards a customs union in a Norway-esque deal should the threat of a backstop on Northern Ireland be removed. The poor UK retail sales data failed to have an effect on the UK benchmark as focus firmly remains on Brexit ahead of PM May&rsquo;s Plan B presentation on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the States, UST futures are lower across the curve with most of the action in the belly following the aforementioned positive trade developments weighing on futures. This has seen 10-yr futures slide to trade in close proximity to session lows of 121-10+ with the 28th December 121-09 low eyed as the next support level to the downside. This also comes after comments from Fed&rsquo;s Evans in yesterday&rsquo;s session, who stated that the dot plot forecast for 2 hikes is reasonable, but it may be less, with Williams and Harker on the docket to speak today.</p>\r\n",
