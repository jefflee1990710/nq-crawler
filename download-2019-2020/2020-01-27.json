The USD and EUR, however, are unmoved. Some desks had suggested equity traders were rotating into names that are more insulated from any potential economic downturn, and sustain earnings in the event the global growth takes a hit; the defensive sectors were the relative outperformers, with utilities, REITs, staples and health care faring best. The pace of Chinese growth could fall by as much as 1ppts, some analysts have argued, and the nation now has a bigger footprint on global growth than it did in 2003 amid the SARS outbreak. Arconic (ARNC) traded higher after its earnings report despite issuing poor guidance and missing top and bottom line estimates.

Today's price action was a result of the Coronavirus updates, which are beginning to weigh on perceptions of global growth. The US sold 2-year and 5-year notes, the latter tailing by 0.1bps at the lowest yield since August 2017, while the 5-year sale was weak, tailing by 1.1bps. On Tuesday, the US will sell 7-year notes; the current 7-year is trading fair on asset swap against older 7s, SocGen observes, though the bank feels it trades rich on the fly against 5s and 10s. The WI yield is trading above recent stop-out rates, suggesting it trades rich on an outright basis vs previous cycles. With that said, SocGen notes that the last four 7s auctions have been digested well, seeing strong foreign participation, and SocGen thinks that this strong demand may help to offset some of the richness within the sector. The bank has a neutral bias heading into the auction, but notes demand might be affected by Wednesday's FOMC meeting. US T-Note futures settled 19+ ticks higher at 130-28+.</p>",

The USD and EUR, however, are unmoved. Some desks had suggested equity traders were rotating into names that are more insulated from any potential economic downturn, and sustain earnings in the event the global growth takes a hit; the defensive sectors were the relative outperformers, with utilities, REITs, staples and health care faring best. The pace of Chinese growth could fall by as much as 1ppts, some analysts have argued, and the nation now has a bigger footprint on global growth than it did in 2003 amid the SARS outbreak. Meanwhile, the Treasury curve bull-flattened, with much attention on 2s5s, which inverted again. Oil continues to see downside, as does copper. FX was a little more flat (EUR and USD), though gold rose to highs around USD 1586, now eying the psychological USD 1600 mark. Looking forward, earnings season steps up on Tuesday with PFE and UTX before the bell and AAPL and AMD reporting after – by week-end investors will have a more intact gauge of the US corporate sector, with just under 30% of the S&amp;P 500 reporting this week alone.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>China has extended its Lunar New Year holidays as it continues to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus. New research has shown that the virus can remain dormant for up to two-weeks before symptoms begin showing, raising risks that fresh cases may rise over the next couple of weeks. The US, meanwhile, has raised travel advisories to China, which urges Americans to reconsider travel to the region. The main focus for market participants remains the impact on global growth. China’s main stock exchanges will now resume trading on 3rd February – although that is not necessary the case for business, where the Zhejiang province has reportedly said companies can’t return till February 9th. Desks have become more concerned about its impact on growth; GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt in H1 2020 and may well prompt stimulus measures by the Chinese Government, Danske Bank has argued. (See our full analysis <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-coronavirus-update-impact-27-01-2020\">here</a>)</p><p><strong>* IMPEACHMENT</strong>: Although the market was happy to dismiss it as noise, given that Trump has the support of the GOP controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required to convict the President, weekend news will compel traders to pay more attention. A NY Times article, citing excerpts from former National Securities Advisor Bolton's upcoming book, alleges that Trump wanted to continue freezing funds for security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats, including Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden, which would undermine the central argument put forward by Trump's defence, and will likely increase the pressure on Republican senators to allow witnesses to be called. Trump has already tweeted on the matter, stating he never told Bolton to tie aid to investigations into Democrats, and \"in fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.\" The WSJ said it was not immediately clear how much the revelations could impact the debate on calling trial witnesses, and it was almost certain not to shift the expectation that Trump won't be convicted, noting that four Republicans would have to join with all Democrats to make that happen. However, a handful of GOP Senators have shown interest in the story, which has the potential to shift the narrative as we head into the Election's Primary Season, which gets underway next week.</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES (DEC): </strong>The 694k missed expectations of a rise to 730k (prev. was revised lower to 697k). Essentially, the print was little changed on the month, but the three-month revisions were lower to the tune of 32k, while the supply of new homes rose to 5.7 months’ worth, up from 5.5 months’ previously. Nevertheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics said the trend in new home sales is increasing, tracking the rising trend in mortgage applications. \"But sales substantially overshot the pace implied by the mortgage data in four of the five months to November, so the December undershoot looks like a correction,\" the consultancy said, \"we thought that the exceptionally mild weather would keep sales elevated a while longer but we aren’t worried about this dip.\" Pantheon reminds us that new home sales numbers are wildly erratic, with a margin of error of +/-15% in December, so today’s data is not the final word, and it expects to see new cycle highs over the next few months, and upward pressure on price increases, given very low inventory.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN IFO (JAN): </strong>The January IFO missed expectations; current conditions New rose a touch to 99.1 (exp. 99.2, prev. 98.8), expectations fell to 92.9 (exp. 95, from a revised – modestly higher - 93.9), while the business climate missed at 95.9 (exp. 97.0, prev. 96.3). \"The print breaks with the trend of improving soft data, and highlights differences in the outlook of businesses and financial analysts,\" Morgan Stanley said; the bank notes that the business climate metric saw registered its first negative print since troughing in August last year, breaking with the trend of steadily improving soft data, with the decrease driven by lower expectations, particularly in the construction and services sectors, while current conditions gained. \"The print follows strong increases in surveys of financial analysts, such as the ZEW and Sentix, and highlights differences in the outlook compared to businesses.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Mersch (hawkish) said the risks of an asset price correction were rising, and current valuations are at high levels; it is preferable to incorporate financial stability concerns into ECB policy deliberations, he argued. There are good reasons to believe that macro-prudential policy in the Euro area was currently constrained in its effectiveness, Mersch said, there could be a large gap between the HICP and what households perceive to be the increase in their cost of living incorporating owner-occupied housing in the reference rate of inflation for policy would provide a clearer signal for monetary policy to lean against housing price booms.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.05/BBL AT USD 53.14/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLED USD 1.37 LOWER AT USD 59.32/BBL:</strong> The energy market’s susceptibility to coronavirus fears extended further on Monday. As the weekend bared news of more deaths in China, and a growing figure of confirmed cases globally, participants further priced in the potential for waning global growth, particularly in China - the largest oil importer. The bearish sentiment saw the crude oil benchmarks gap lower on the futures open, with front month Brent trading below USD 60.00/bbl, before staying rangebound. OPEC officials have said that there would be little impact from the coronavirus on the global oil market, for now, in addition to suggesting the price decline is an exaggeration related to “psychology” and “extreme pessimism”. Citigroup’s analysts note that technical factors could also be exacerbating the sell-off, such as delta hedging as the benchmarks fall through strike prices. Meanwhile, Libya’s NOC announced that oil production on Monday stood at 262k BPD (full capacity is 1.2mln BPD), and that it could fall to 72k BPD very soon, perhaps alleviated some supply glut concerns, which grew last week after it appeared the blockade in place – as implemented by forces loyal to Haftar - could be removed sooner than previously anticipated; NOC also said that some efforts are underway to lift the blockade, although the timing is uncertain. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventory expectations (bbls): crude +0.5mln, distillates -1.3mln, gasoline +1.2mln and Genscape forecasts Cushing -0.87mln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 19+ TICKS HIGHER AT 130-28+. </strong>Yields were lower by around 4-8bps, bull flattening; major curve spreads had narrowed between 1-3bps, with much attention on the 2s5s spread, which went negative again after a lacklustre 2-year auction. Today's price action was a result of the Coronavirus updates, which are beginning to weigh on perceptions of global growth. The US sold 2-year and 5-year notes, the latter tailing by 0.1bps at the lowest yield since August 2017, while the 5-year sale was weak, tailing by 1.1bps. On Tuesday, the US will sell 7-year notes; the current 7-year is trading fair on asset swap against older 7s, SocGen observes, though the bank feels it trades rich on the fly against 5s and 10s. The WI yield is trading above recent stop-out rates, suggesting it trades rich on an outright basis vs previous cycles. With that said, SocGen notes that the last four 7s auctions have been digested well, seeing strong foreign participation, and SocGen thinks that this strong demand may help to offset some of the richness within the sector. The bank has a neutral bias heading into the auction, but notes demand might be affected by Wednesday's FOMC meeting.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>BTPs caught a significant bid on Monday, with traders citing reduce risks of snap elections after regional elections over the weekend saw the leftist PD retain the Emilia-Romagna region; there had been fears that right wing parties might would make headway. Indeed, although The League won a majority in Calabria, the votes still represent a setback for The League's efforts to consolidate power, analysts at Stratfor said, although the party remains the country's most popular party on the national level, according to opinion polls, and could win the next general election. Additionally, Stratfor argues that the Five Star Movement's poor performance in Emilia-Romagna may also prompt its coalition partner, the PD, to demand greater authority in the ruling alliance.</p><p><strong>* FOMC PREVIEW: </strong>Rates are seen unchanged at 1.50-1.75%. Officials appear comfortable with the current stance, though markets still see a rate cut in 2020. A 'technical' IOER hike is possible. No SRF announcement expected, details sought. No SEP update until March. The narrative may be more pertinent for longer-term themes like balance sheet policy and the framework review. Meanwhile, perceptions about the Fed's commitment to accommodation may be a catalyst for any price moves. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23720/download\">To download the report, please click here.</a></p><p><strong>* STOCK CLOSES: </strong>SPX -1.60% AT 3243; DOW -1.57% AT 28,535; NDX -2.07% AT 8952.</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Cons Disc -1.53%, Cons Staples -0.32, Energy -2.77%, Financials -1.55%, Health -0.76%, Industrials -1.87%, Materials -2.11%, Real Estate -0.42%, Technology -2.36%, Communications -1.7%, Utilities -0.31%.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS IMPACTED STOCKS:</strong> Travel focussed stocks, such as United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwestern Airlines (LUV) are trading heavily in the red, with some holding losses of over 7% at the lows on travel disruption concerns due to the Coronavirus. Trip.com (TCOM) fell over 8% at the open, however losses pared back throughout the session and eventually traded higher. Casino names like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco (MLCO) are facing even further pressure as the confirmed cases in Macau increased to five. Copper miner Freeport McMoran (FCX) is lower as copper prices fall to 8-week lows on global growth concerns, while gold miners (GOLD, NEM) are benefitting as the precious metal rises in a safe haven bid. China listed ADR’s (BABA, JD, BIDU) also hit given the exposure to the nation. Starbucks (SBUX) and Yum China (YUMC) announced they have closed all its shops and suspended delivery service in the Hubei province. Clorox (CLX) performed well as it is a company which manufactures disinfecting wipes to help prevent the spread of disease.</p><p>* <strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Arconic (ARNC) traded higher after its earnings report despite issuing poor guidance and missing top and bottom line estimates.

AbbVie (ABBV) and Allergan (AGN) traded higher after ABBV announced it is to divest certain drugs in order to approve the merger.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: DXY </strong>slightly firmer but fails to cross 98.00 to the upside in rangebound trade, hovering just above its 100dma at 97.87. <strong>CNH</strong> loses ground amid coronavirus concerns, with participants beginning to ponder the impact to growth. <strong>EUR</strong> traded within a 30-pip range against the buck with German IFO data doing little to sway the single currency. <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> firmer in a flight to quality due to the continued coronavirus concerns which saw USDJPY flirt around the 109-figure, and XAU print highs of 1586 before paring the majority of gains after gapping higher at the open. The precious metal benefited from the disease, whereas copper prices hit an 8-week low on global growth concerns. <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> lost ground due to the risk off environment to start the week, AUDUSD fell beneath 0.68 and NZDUSD beneath 0.66. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker across the board due to the risk off tone, however there was particular weakness in <strong>ZAR</strong> and <strong>RUB,</strong> with the latter suffering from weaker oil prices.</p>",

Today's price action was a result of the Coronavirus updates, which are beginning to weigh on perceptions of global growth. The US sold 2-year and 5-year notes, the latter tailing by 0.1bps at the lowest yield since August 2017, while the 5-year sale was weak, tailing by 1.1bps. On Tuesday, the US will sell 7-year notes; the current 7-year is trading fair on asset swap against older 7s, SocGen observes, though the bank feels it trades rich on the fly against 5s and 10s. The WI yield is trading above recent stop-out rates, suggesting it trades rich on an outright basis vs previous cycles. With that said, SocGen notes that the last four 7s auctions have been digested well, seeing strong foreign participation, and SocGen thinks that this strong demand may help to offset some of the richness within the sector. The bank has a neutral bias heading into the auction, but notes demand might be affected by Wednesday's FOMC meeting.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The energy market’s susceptibility to coronavirus fears extended further on Monday. As the weekend bared news of more deaths in China, and a growing figure of confirmed cases globally, participants further priced in the potential for waning global growth, particularly in China - the largest oil importer. The bearish sentiment saw the crude oil benchmarks gap lower on the futures open, with front month Brent trading below USD 60.00/bbl, before staying rangebound. OPEC officials have said that there would be little impact from the coronavirus on the global oil market, for now, in addition to suggesting the price decline is an exaggeration related to “psychology” and “extreme pessimism”. Citigroup’s analysts note that technical factors could also be exacerbating the sell-off, such as delta hedging as the benchmarks fall through strike prices. Meanwhile, Libya’s NOC announced that oil production on Monday stood at 262k BPD (full capacity is 1.2mln BPD), and that it could fall to 72k BPD very soon, perhaps alleviated some supply glut concerns, which grew last week after it appeared the blockade in place – as implemented by forces loyal to Haftar - could be removed sooner than previously anticipated; NOC also said that some efforts are underway to lift the blockade, although the timing is uncertain. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventory expectations (bbls): crude +0.5mln, distillates -1.3mln, gasoline +1.2mln and Genscape forecasts Cushing -0.87mln.</p>",

The WI yield is trading well below previous stop-out rates, and this could be a negative for the auction, as the sector richens on an outright basis. The last auction saw weak participation from foreigners, and heading into this auction, dealer holdings are relatively high at the front-end of the curve, which may limit dealer participations, which was a support at recent auctions. SocGen suggests that it should mean only tepid demand at today's auction, and sees a negative outcome. \"However, fear of spread of the viral outbreak might cause the investors flee to the safety of bonds, marginally supporting the auction despite the rich outright valuations,\" the bank writes.</p><p><strong>2-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 1.653%, six-auction average 1.634%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.0bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.31x, six-auction avg. 2.57x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 32.2%, six-auction avg. 29.6%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 21.5%, six-auction avg. 21.0%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 46.3%, six-auction avg. 49.4%)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The 5-year sector appears to be cheap in asset swap against older 5s, and looks fair on the fly against 2s and 10s, SocGen says. The December auction was decent, amid the cheaper valuations, but for the current cycle, the sector appears rich on an outright basis, with the WI currently trading beneath 5-year auction stop-out rates. \"Moreover, relatively high dealer holdings in the 3-6 year sector is not supportive of demand for the auction,\" SocGen writes, \"notwithstanding, the specialness of the current 5-year in repo might marginally support demand,\" though the bank says it is still slightly negative on this auction.</p><p><strong>US 5-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 1.756%, six-auction average 1.617%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -1.6bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.49x, six-auction avg. 2.41x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 21.5%, six-auction avg. 24.6%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 16.1%, six-auction avg. 14.6%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 62.4%, six-auction avg. 60.8%)</li></ul>",

Participants could be giving more credence to the impeachment trial State-side after excerpts from former National Security Advisor Bolton’s book came to light – alleging quid-pro-quo, which desks believe could increase pressure on Republican Senators to allow witnesses to be called. DXY meandered on either side of its 100 DMA (97.87) throughout the session having clocked an intraday band of 97.78-94. Looking ahead, tomorrow sees the release of December US Durable Goods figures, with the headline seen rebounding to +0.4% from -2.1%.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF, XAU</strong></p><p>Conversely, safe-haven assets have latched onto their virus-induced bid; USD/JPY and EUR/CHF look to end the EU-session towards the bottom of their respective intraday ranges, with the former fluctuating on either side of the 109.00 mark vs. Friday 109.25 close (having traded in a 108.73-109.14 intraday band), whilst the latter is poised to end the session sub-1.0700 having broken below the psychological level in early EU trade. Spot gold gapped higher at the open and held onto a bulk of its gains, with prices finding resistance just shy of USD 1590/oz, having eclipsed the prior recent high of USD 1588/oz vs. Friday’s 1571/oz close.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The marked underperformers amid the overall risk aversion in the marketplace coupled with ramifications of the coronavirus - including detrimental price action in the commodity space. AUD/USD looks to end the European session towards the bottom of its 0.6765-0.6819 range, having given up its 0.68-status ahead of potential support at 0.6755, the Nov 29th low, which also coincides with a 76.4% fib. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart lost its 0.6600 handle and drifted to a current low of 0.6555, ahead of its 55 and 200 DMAs at 0.6550 and 0.6512 respectively. Overnight sees the release of the Australian NAB business condition, but this is unlikely to prompt much sustained action in the pair given the macro environment.</p><p><strong>CAD, NOK, RUB</strong></p><p>Energy-correlated FX remained pressured by the hefty losses seen in the oil complex amid the implications of the virus outbreak on global oil demand. USD/CAD looks set to end the European day towards the top of today’s current 1.3150-1.3191, having surpassed its 55 and 100 DMAs (1.3158 and 1.3178 respectively) ahead of potential barriers at the psychological 1.3200 mark. Similarly, the Norwegian Crown bled past the 10.000 level, and thereafter its 55 and 100 DMAs vs. the EUR (10.0030 and 10.0184) with the pair eyeing 10.0500 heading into the close.

Participants could be giving more credence to the impeachment trial State-side after excerpts from former National Security Advisor Bolton’s book came to light – alleging quid-pro-quo, which desks believe could increase pressure on Republican Senators to allow witnesses to be called. DXY meandered on either side of its 100 DMA (97.87) throughout the session having clocked an intraday band of 97.78-94. Looking ahead, tomorrow sees the release of December US Durable Goods figures, with the headline seen rebounding to +0.4% from -2.1%.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF, XAU</strong></p><p>Conversely, safe-haven assets have latched onto their virus-induced bid; USD/JPY and EUR/CHF look to end the EU-session towards the bottom of their respective intraday ranges, with the former fluctuating on either side of the 109.00 mark vs. Friday 109.25 close (having traded in a 108.73-109.14 intraday band), whilst the latter is poised to end the session sub-1.0700 having broken below the psychological level in early EU trade. Spot gold gapped higher at the open and held onto a bulk of its gains, with prices finding resistance just shy of USD 1590/oz, having eclipsed the prior recent high of USD 1588/oz vs. Friday’s 1571/oz close.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The marked underperformers amid the overall risk aversion in the marketplace coupled with ramifications of the coronavirus - including detrimental price action in the commodity space. AUD/USD looks to end the European session towards the bottom of its 0.6765-0.6819 range, having given up its 0.68-status ahead of potential support at 0.6755, the Nov 29th low, which also coincides with a 76.4% fib. Similarly, its Kiwi counterpart lost its 0.6600 handle and drifted to a current low of 0.6555, ahead of its 55 and 200 DMAs at 0.6550 and 0.6512 respectively. Overnight sees the release of the Australian NAB business condition, but this is unlikely to prompt much sustained action in the pair given the macro environment.</p><p><strong>CAD, NOK, RUB</strong></p><p>Energy-correlated FX remained pressured by the hefty losses seen in the oil complex amid the implications of the virus outbreak on global oil demand. USD/CAD looks set to end the European day towards the top of today’s current 1.3150-1.3191, having surpassed its 55 and 100 DMAs (1.3158 and 1.3178 respectively) ahead of potential barriers at the psychological 1.3200 mark. Similarly, the Norwegian Crown bled past the 10.000 level, and thereafter its 55 and 100 DMAs vs. the EUR (10.0030 and 10.0184) with the pair eyeing 10.0500 heading into the close.

Copper miner Freeport McMoran (FCX) is lower as copper prices fall to 8-week lows on global growth concerns, while gold miners (GOLD, NEM) are benefitting as the precious metal rises in a safe haven bid.

The WI yield is trading well below previous stop-out rates, and this could be a negative for the auction, as the sector richens on an outright basis. The last auction saw weak participation from foreigners, and heading into this auction, dealer holdings are relatively high at the front-end of the curve, which may limit dealer participations, which was a support at recent auctions. SocGen suggests that it should mean only tepid demand at today's auction, and sees a negative outcome. \"However, fear of spread of the viral outbreak might cause the investors flee to the safety of bonds, marginally supporting the auction despite the rich outright valuations,\" the bank writes.</p><p><strong>2-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield: (prev. 1.653%, six-auction average 1.634%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.0bps, six-auction avg. -0.4bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.31x, six-auction avg. 2.57x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 32.2%, six-auction avg. 29.6%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 21.5%, six-auction avg. 21.0%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 46.3%, six-auction avg. 49.4%)</li></ul><p><strong>5-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The 5-year sector appears to be cheap in asset swap against older 5s, and looks fair on the fly against 2s and 10s, SocGen says.

This heavily pressured US equity futures which slipped around 1% in early trade and spurred safe-haven bids for T-notes and gold, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.0%)</strong> sold off due to the virus outbreak fears, detrimental currency flows and against the backdrop of thinned conditions with nearly all major bourses in the region closed for holiday. <strong>India’s NIFTY (-1.0%)</strong> was also lower after large-scale protests yesterday regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act, but with losses limited amid corporate earnings including ICICI Bank. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned on safe-haven buying due to the coronavirus jitters which also spurred T-notes to gap higher by about 10 ticks at the re-open, although the upward momentum for JGBs has since petered out amid the lack of BoJ presence in the market and absence of most regional participants.</p><p>China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission is to encourage banks to appropriately reduce lending rates for sectors heavily impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.

For reference, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index sees around 95% of its stocks in negative territory. UK’s FTSE 100 (-2.5%) sees slightly more pronounced downside amid heavy-bleeding from large-cap miners and energy names, in-fitting with price action in the respective complexes - Rio Tino (-4.8%), Antofagasta (-4.3%), Anglo American (-4.5%), Glencore (-4.5%), BP (-2.0%) and Shell (-2.0%).&nbsp; Meanwhile, Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.7%) fares better in light of the aftermath from the Emilia Romagna regional elections which diminished the chances of an Italian snap election, thus Italian banks cushion losses in the index with tailwinds from favourable BTP price action – Ubi Banca (+0.1%), Banco BPM (+0.1%), Intesa Sanpaolo (-0.1%). Sectors are broadly, but firmly in the red, with Materials (-2.8%) lagging amid the base-metal price action. Defensives meanwhile see losses to a lesser extent than their cyclical peers. Consumer discretionary names also remain a laggard amid the demand implications from the virus outbreak for luxury goods and travel names, such as: Swatch (-3.6%), Richemont (-3.0%), IAG (-6.0%) and easyJet (-5.5%). In terms of individual movers; William Hill (-1.7%) saw losses at the open amid a breakdown in expansion talks with CBS Sports. Bayer (-1.5%) conforms to losses seen in the region despite a pushback from a spokesperson regarding last-week’s sources reports of an imminent settlement to its Roundup weedkiller scandal. On the flip side, positive broker moves see RWE (+0.1%), Uniper (+0.1%) Orsted (+0.1%) and Italgas (+1.4%) in the green.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Broad losses experienced in the EM-sphere, led by downside in the Yuan as the coronavirus crisis claims more lives and spreads further towards the West (full analysis available on the Newsquawk feed). USD/CNH has gained traction and breached 6.9800 to the upside (vs. 6.9400 low), topping its 200 and 55 DMAs at 6.9817 and 6.9843 respectively – with talks of potential stimulus measures by the Chinese Government to cushion the economic impact of the outbreak. TRY and ZAR feel the Yuan contagion with USD/TRY looking for a test of 5.9500 to the upside whilst USD/ZAR inches closer to 14.6000, but could see mild resistance at 14.5970 (21st Jan high) with reported stops above the round figure and ahead its 200 DMA at 14.6105.</p><p><strong>CAD, NOK, RUB - </strong>Energy-related FX succumb to losses seen in the complex as jitters materialise regarding the implications of the virus outbreak on global oil demand. The Rouble remains the most impacted as USD/RUB surpasses 62.50 (vs. 62.24 open) before stopping short of its 200 DMA (62.63). The Loonie meanwhile extends losses vs. the Buck as the pair found support ~1.3150 before taking out its 55 and 100 DMAs (at 1.3158 and 1.3178 respectively) ahead of the psychological 1.3200. Similarly, Norway’s oil-correlated Crown drifted lower since the open – EUR/NOK reclaimed 10.0000 (which also coincides with its 55DMA) to the upside and topped its 100 DMA (10.0183) – with potential resistance touted at 10.0500.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD - </strong>The antipodeans also drift in tandem with the risk aversion and headwinds from detrimental base metal price action amid the aforementioned virus woes. AUD/USD has given up its 0.6800-status as losses exacerbated amid the domino-effect coronavirus would have on the Australian economy via China’s anticipated economic slowdown – with reports noting that Chinese GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt. The pair remains the marked G10 underperformer thus far and eyes 0.6755 (26th Nov low and 76.4% Fibo of the Oct to Dec move) to the downside for a potential support level, and with some AUD 800mln in options seen expiring at strike 0.6765. Meanwhile, its Kiwi counterpart looks to test its 55 DMA to the downside at 0.6550.</p><p><strong>JPY, DXY - </strong>Safe haven flows have seen an early bid in the Japanese currency, as USD/JPY gapped below 109.00 at the open vs. Friday’s 109.25 close. Since then, the pair has fluctuated on either side of the round figure having found a base around 108.75, and with technicians eyeing 108.67 (100 DMA) and 108.52 (200 DMA) should the base fail to hold, and with 109.00 seeing circa USD 800mln in options expiries. DXY meanwhile remains flat intraday having notched a current range of 97.800-941 and with little by way of schedule data/speakers to sway the state of play.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP - </strong>Mixed session for the Sterling and Single Currency, but relatively muted action compared to some of its G10 and EM peers. EUR/USD saw some pressure amid a downbeat German Ifo Survey which reaffirmed that the German economy has a subdued start to the year, but somewhat echoed Markit’s assessment that the manufacturing sector is slowly emerging from its downturn. EUR/USD failed to glean much reprieve from the development in Italy after the Centre-Left bloc defeated Salvini’s league in regional elections, thus dimming the chances of a snap election. The pair hovers just above 1.1000, having clocked in a current range of 1.1015-35. Meanwhile, Cable found an overnight base at 1.3050 and took advantage of some weakness seen in the Single Currency. EUR/GBP drifts further below 0.8450 whilst GBP/USD meanders just under 1.3100, having eclipsed the level in recent trade.</p><p><strong>Notable Expriries, NY Cut:</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUD/USD: <strong>0.6765 (800M),</strong> 0.6880 (230M)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/JPY: <strong>109.00 (805M),</strong> 110.50 (300M)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Debt is broadly lifted this morning on coronavirus concerns, with a full analysis piece available on the Newsquawk headline feed, as the risk-off theme continues to dominate. Coronavirus aside, Italian debt is firmer by over 200bp at present as the left-wing bloc successfully repelled Salvini’s League in the Emilia Romagna regional election; Democratic Party took 51.4% and the League’s coalition 43.7%, and as such significantly reduces the chances of another general election. Price action which has sent the <strong>BTP-Bund yield </strong>spread below 140 (tested 138.0 at best) thus far, to levels not seen since September/October’19. Technically speaking, for <strong>BTP’s</strong> resistance lies at 147.13 and then clear-air until 147.86; after-which very little is present before 150.00. Periphery aside, core debt is firmer on the aforementioned broad macro theme, for <strong>Bunds</strong> resistance lies just above 174 at 174.05, which coincides with the 31st October high and the 50DMA (currently, 173.88 at best). Moving to the States where an incredibly quiet calendar provides little inspiration on a macro perspective; however, this week seen the largest number of US Co’s reporting earnings, which will provide insight into the economy’s health – as well as the FOMC on Wednesday. <strong>USTs</strong> are bid in a similar fashion to European bonds with yields suppressed, 10-year yield having convincingly relinquished the 1.70 mark to the downside overnight, with a test of 1.60 now perhaps on the cards if this morning’s price action continues.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>WTI and Brent front-month futures continue their downward trajectory amid the materialising concerns surrounding the virus outbreak’s impact on global growth, oil demand and overall sentiment. While some desks have drawn comparisons to the SARS virus in 2003, which trimmed 0.15ppts off of global growth, some believe that the comparisons may be slightly unfair, albeit some economists note that Chinese GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt. WTI Mar’20 futures gapped lower at the open before downside exacerbated and prompted the contract to test levels close to USD 52/bbl to the downside, levels last seen in October 2019. Similarly, Brent Mar’20 surrendered the USD 60/bbl handle and currently posts loses around USD 2/bbl; the contract did find some support at USD 58.50/bbl. Elsewhere spot gold is bolstered by the flows in to safe-havens, with prices testing USD 1590/oz to the upside during APAC trade vs. Friday’s ~USD 1570/oz. The overall demand/global growth aspect of the outbreak of the coronavirus has led to sharp losses in base metal prices: copper slumped around 2% at one point and dipped below USD 2.62/lb vs. Friday’s ~USD 2.67/lb close, whilst iron ore futures fell as much as 6% at one point.</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz said they are closely observing developments in the global oil market resulting from gloomy expectations regarding impact from coronavirus, while he added that Saudi and OPEC+ producers have the capability and flexibility required to respond to any developments by taking necessary action to support oil market stability if required.

For reference, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index sees around 95% of its stocks in negative territory. UK’s FTSE 100 (-2.5%) sees slightly more pronounced downside amid heavy-bleeding from large-cap miners and energy names, in-fitting with price action in the respective complexes - Rio Tino (-4.8%), Antofagasta (-4.3%), Anglo American (-4.5%), Glencore (-4.5%), BP (-2.0%) and Shell (-2.0%).&nbsp; Meanwhile, Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.7%) fares better in light of the aftermath from the Emilia Romagna regional elections which diminished the chances of an Italian snap election, thus Italian banks cushion losses in the index with tailwinds from favourable BTP price action – Ubi Banca (+0.1%), Banco BPM (+0.1%), Intesa Sanpaolo (-0.1%). Sectors are broadly, but firmly in the red, with Materials (-2.8%) lagging amid the base-metal price action. Defensives meanwhile see losses to a lesser extent than their cyclical peers. Consumer discretionary names also remain a laggard amid the demand implications from the virus outbreak for luxury goods and travel names, such as: Swatch (-3.6%), Richemont (-3.0%), IAG (-6.0%) and easyJet (-5.5%). In terms of individual movers; William Hill (-1.7%) saw losses at the open amid a breakdown in expansion talks with CBS Sports. Bayer (-1.5%) conforms to losses seen in the region despite a pushback from a spokesperson regarding last-week’s sources reports of an imminent settlement to its Roundup weedkiller scandal. On the flip side, positive broker moves see RWE (+0.1%), Uniper (+0.1%) Orsted (+0.1%) and Italgas (+1.4%) in the green.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>EM - Broad losses experienced in the EM-sphere, led by downside in the Yuan as the coronavirus crisis claims more lives and spreads further towards the West (full analysis available on the Newsquawk feed). USD/CNH has gained traction and breached 6.9800 to the upside (vs. 6.9400 low), topping its 200 and 55 DMAs at 6.9817 and 6.9843 respectively – with talks of potential stimulus measures by the Chinese Government to cushion the economic impact of the outbreak. TRY and ZAR feel the Yuan contagion with USD/TRY looking for a test of 5.9500 to the upside whilst USD/ZAR inches closer to 14.6000, but could see mild resistance at 14.5970 (21st Jan high) with reported stops above the round figure and ahead its 200 DMA at 14.6105.</p><p>CAD, NOK, RUB - Energy-related FX succumb to losses seen in the complex as jitters materialise regarding the implications of the virus outbreak on global oil demand. The Rouble remains the most impacted as USD/RUB surpasses 62.50 (vs. 62.24 open) before stopping short of its 200 DMA (62.63). The Loonie meanwhile extends losses vs. the Buck as the pair found support ~1.3150 before taking out its 55 and 100 DMAs (at 1.3158 and 1.3178 respectively) ahead of the psychological 1.3200. Similarly, Norway’s oil-correlated Crown drifted lower since the open – EUR/NOK reclaimed 10.0000 (which also coincides with its 55DMA) to the upside and topped its 100 DMA (10.0183) – with potential resistance touted at 10.0500.</p><p>AUD, NZD - The antipodeans also drift in tandem with the risk aversion and headwinds from detrimental base metal price action amid the aforementioned virus woes. AUD/USD has given up its 0.6800-status as losses exacerbated amid the domino-effect coronavirus would have on the Australian economy via China’s anticipated economic slowdown – with reports noting that Chinese GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt. The pair remains the marked G10 underperformer thus far and eyes 0.6755 (26th Nov low and 76.4% Fibo of the Oct to Dec move) to the downside for a potential support level, and with some AUD 800mln in options seen expiring at strike 0.6765. Meanwhile, its Kiwi counterpart looks to test its 55 DMA to the downside at 0.6550.</p><p>JPY, DXY - Safe haven flows have seen an early bid in the Japanese currency, as USD/JPY gapped below 109.00 at the open vs. Friday’s 109.25 close. Since then, the pair has fluctuated on either side of the round figure having found a base around 108.75, and with technicians eyeing 108.67 (100 DMA) and 108.52 (200 DMA) should the base fail to hold, and with 109.00 seeing circa USD 800mln in options expiries. DXY meanwhile remains flat intraday having notched a current range of 97.800-941 and with little by way of schedule data/speakers to sway the state of play.</p><p>EUR, GBP - Mixed session for the Sterling and Single Currency, but relatively muted action compared to some of its G10 and EM peers. EUR/USD saw some pressure amid a downbeat German Ifo Survey which reaffirmed that the German economy has a subdued start to the year, but somewhat echoed Markit’s assessment that the manufacturing sector is slowly emerging from its downturn. EUR/USD failed to glean much reprieve from the development in Italy after the Centre-Left bloc defeated Salvini’s league in regional elections, thus dimming the chances of a snap election. The pair hovers just above 1.1000, having clocked in a current range of 1.1015-35. Meanwhile, Cable found an overnight base at 1.3050 and took advantage of some weakness seen in the Single Currency. EUR/GBP drifts further below 0.8450 whilst GBP/USD meanders just under 1.3100, having eclipsed the level in recent trade.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Debt is broadly lifted this morning on coronavirus concerns, with a full analysis piece available on the Newsquawk headline feed, as the risk-off theme continues to dominate. Coronavirus aside, Italian debt is firmer by over 200bp at present as the left-wing bloc successfully repelled Salvini’s League in the Emilia Romagna regional election; Democratic Party took 51.4% and the League’s coalition 43.7%, and as such significantly reduces the chances of another general election. Price action which has sent the <strong>BTP</strong>-<strong>Bund</strong> yield spread below 140 (tested 138.0 at best) thus far, to levels not seen since September/October’19. Technically speaking, for <strong>BTP’s</strong> resistance lies at 147.13 and then clear-air until 147.86; after-which very little is present before 150.00. Periphery aside, core debt is firmer on the aforementioned broad macro theme, for <strong>Bunds</strong> resistance lies just above 174 at 174.05, which coincides with the 31st October high and the 50DMA (currently, 173.88 at best). Moving to the States where an incredibly quiet calendar provides little inspiration on a macro perspective; however, this week seen the largest number of US Co’s reporting earnings, which will provide insight into the economy’s health – as well as the FOMC on Wednesday. <strong>USTs</strong> are bid in a similar fashion to European bonds with yields suppressed, 10-year yield having convincingly relinquished the 1.70 mark to the downside overnight, with a test of 1.60 now perhaps on the cards if this morning’s price action continues.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures continue their downward trajectory amid the materialising concerns surrounding the virus outbreak’s impact on global growth, oil demand and overall sentiment. While some desks have drawn comparisons to the SARS virus in 2003, which trimmed 0.15ppts off of global growth, some believe that the comparisons may be slightly unfair, albeit some economists note that Chinese GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt. <strong>WTI</strong> Mar’20 futures gapped lower at the open before downside exacerbated and prompted the contract to test levels close to USD 52/bbl to the downside, levels last seen in October 2019. Similarly, <strong>Brent</strong> Mar’20 surrendered the USD 60/bbl handle and currently posts loses around USD 2/bbl; the contract did find some support at USD 58.50/bbl. Elsewhere <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> is bolstered by the flows in to safe-havens, with prices testing USD 1590/oz to the upside during APAC trade vs. Friday’s ~USD 1570/oz. The overall demand/global growth aspect of the outbreak of the coronavirus has led to sharp losses in base metal prices: <strong>copper</strong> slumped around 2% at one point and dipped below USD 2.62/lb vs. Friday’s ~USD 2.67/lb close, whilst <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures fell as much as 6% at one point.</p>",

        "subject": "GS says neither history, positioning, nor valuation shows cause for panic; sees S&P 500 trading sideways until election, ending 2020 at 3400",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>HISTORY: </strong>The S&amp;P 500 has risen 11% in the last 3-months, led by a 22% rally in tech, and similar surges have not signaled the end of the bull market. Over the last 3-months, the returns/realised volatility ratio has been 1.7; Looking at 3-month periods with that ratio at 1.5 or greater, the median S&amp;P 500 return during the next month was -0.2%, but the median 3-month and 12-month returns were +6% and +13%.</li><li><strong>POSITIONING: </strong>Positioning data is muddy. Current institutional investor positioning screens as extremely elevated, but US households have declined to embrace the recent rally.</li><li><strong>VALUATION: </strong>Valuations, not earnings, have been driving the rally. S&amp;P 500 forward P/E is 19.3x vs. 17.6x 3-months ago, and 15.0x at the start of 2019. Meanwhile, consensus 2020 EPS has been lowered by 2% since the start of Q4, and forecasts 9% EPS growth this year. GS sees 6% EPS growth, so believes further downward revisions are likely to the consensus.</li><li><strong>VALUATIONS JUSTIFIED: </strong>Macro environment is supportive of valuations, GS says. US and global growth data has stabilised, and the US/China trade deal reduces downside risk to global growth. Fed funds futures show that the market continues to expect the Fed will remain on hold this year, and 10-year US Treasury yields have remained below 2%. GS' model indicates that the current 340bps 'yield gap' between the S&amp;P 500 EPS yield and Treasury yield is in line with fair value.</li><li><strong>ELECTION PRESENTS RISKS: </strong>The Presidential race will likely provide some headwind to multiples. Historically, S&amp;P 500 valuations have declined ahead of elections alongside an increase in economic policy uncertainty, and GS estimates that a 25bps rise in 10-year Treasury yields would lower S&amp;P 500 P/E to 18.5x from its current 19.3x.</li><li><strong>MARKET BREADTH: </strong>GS says market breadth does not appear to be a major risk. While IT (+22% over 3-months) accounts for 45% of the S&amp;P 500 return (with one-fifth attributable just to AAPL at +32% and MSFT at +22%), strength within IT was broad-based: Semis, Hardware, and Software &amp; Services sub-sectors have all outperformed, as have Health Care and CommServices sectors (24% of the S&amp;P 500).</li><li><strong>CONCENTRATION: </strong>Instead, GS argues that market concentration is more concerning. The five largest stocks currently account for 17% of S&amp;P 500 market cap, the highest in the last 30 years outside of the Tech Bubble - any shock to any of these companies (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB) could pose a major headwind to aggregate S&amp;P 500 index performance, GS argues, a risk that is heightened by the regulatory and factor exposures shared by these stocks.</li><li><strong>ECONOMIC GROWTH: </strong>One bullish argument is GS economists' expectation that US growth will accelerate in H1 2020; industrials have lagged but should outperform if GDP growth accelerates, the bank believes. S&amp;P 500 Industrials stocks with above-average betas to US economic data surprises during the last two years include: EXPD, UAL, CAT, BA, FAST, ALK, JBHT, UPS, HON, FDX, LUV, DOV, UNP, NLSN, GE, CTAS, NSC, ODFL, LMT, VRSK, EFX, NOC, LHX, TDG.</li><li><strong>YEAR-END TARGET: </strong>The S&amp;P 500 is already within 3% of its year-end target, and investors must now evaluate whether to raise expectations, or cut risk. GS argues that while most positive catalysts already appear embedded in the S&amp;P 500 price, neither history, positioning, nor valuation shows cause for panic. GS continues to expect the S&amp;P 500 will trade sideways near 3250 ahead of the election in November, but rally to 3400 by year-end (current consensus is 3355 for year-end 2020).</li></ul>",

Moving to the States where an incredibly quiet calendar provides little inspiration on a macro perspective; however, this week seen the largest number of US Co’s reporting earnings, which will provide insight into the economy’s health – as well as the FOMC on Wednesday. USTs are bid in a similar fashion to European bonds with yields suppressed, 10-year yield having convincingly relinquished the 1.70 mark to the downside overnight, with a test of 1.60 now perhaps on the cards if this morning’s price action continues.</p>",

        "content": "<p>EM</p><p>Broad losses experienced in the EM-sphere, led by downside in the Yuan as the coronavirus crisis claims more lives and spreads further towards the West (full analysis available on the Newsquawk feed). USD/CNH has gained traction and breached 6.9800 to the upside (vs. 6.9400 low), topping its 200 and 55 DMAs at 6.9817 and 6.9843 respectively – with talks of potential stimulus measures by the Chinese Government to cushion the economic impact of the outbreak. TRY and ZAR feel the Yuan contagion with USD/TRY looking for a test of 5.9500 to the upside whilst USD/ZAR inches closer to 14.6000, but could see mild resistance at 14.5970 (21st Jan high) with reported stops above the round figure and ahead its 200 DMA at 14.6105.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CAD, NOK, RUB</p><p>Energy-related FX succumb to losses seen in the complex as jitters materialise regarding the implications of the virus outbreak on global oil demand. The Rouble remains the most impacted as USD/RUB surpasses 62.50 (vs. 62.24 open) before stopping short of its 200 DMA (62.63). The Loonie meanwhile extends losses vs. the Buck as the pair found support ~1.3150 before taking out its 55 and 100 DMAs (at 1.3158 and 1.3178 respectively) ahead of the psychological 1.3200. Similarly, Norway’s oil-correlated Crown drifted lower since the open – EUR/NOK reclaimed 10.0000 (which also coincides with its 55DMA) to the upside and topped its 100 DMA (10.0183) – with potential resistance touted at 10.0500.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AUD, NZD</p><p>The antipodeans also drift in tandem with the risk aversion and headwinds from detrimental base metal price action amid the aforementioned virus woes. AUD/USD has given up its 0.6800-status as losses exacerbated amid the domino-effect coronavirus would have on the Australian economy via China’s anticipated economic slowdown – with reports noting that Chinese GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt. The pair remains the marked G10 underperformer thus far and eyes 0.6755 (26th Nov low and 76.4% Fibo of the Oct to Dec move) to the downside for a potential support level, and with some AUD 800mln in options seen expiring at strike 0.6765. Meanwhile, its Kiwi counterpart looks to test its 55 DMA to the downside at 0.6550.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JPY, DXY</p><p>Safe haven flows have seen an early bid in the Japanese currency, as USD/JPY gapped below 109.00 at the open vs. Friday’s 109.25 close. Since then, the pair has fluctuated on either side of the round figure having found a base around 108.75, and with technicians eyeing 108.67 (100 DMA) and 108.52 (200 DMA) should the base fail to hold, and with 109.00 seeing circa USD 800mln in options expiries. DXY meanwhile remains flat intraday having notched a current range of 97.800-941 and with little by way of schedule data/speakers to sway the state of play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EUR, GBP</p><p>Mixed session for the Sterling and Single Currency, but relatively muted action compared to some of its G10 and EM peers. EUR/USD saw some pressure amid a downbeat German Ifo Survey which reaffirmed that the German economy has a subdued start to the year, but somewhat echoed Markit’s assessment that the manufacturing sector is slowly emerging from its downturn. EUR/USD failed to glean much reprieve from the development in Italy after the Centre-Left bloc defeated Salvini’s league in regional elections, thus dimming the chances of a snap election. The pair hovers just above 1.1000, having clocked in a current range of 1.1015-35. Meanwhile, Cable found an overnight base at 1.3050 and took advantage of some weakness seen in the Single Currency. EUR/GBP drifts further below 0.8450 whilst GBP/USD meanders just under 1.3100, having eclipsed the level in recent trade.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*CURRENT SCALE</strong></p><ul><li>China’s National Health Commission has confirmed 2744 cases of the virus, and the death toll has now increased to 80 as of January 26th; additionally, over 30k individuals are under observation.</li><li>Outside of China, the <strong>US</strong> has confirmed their 5th case (a further 63 are being monitored), as have <strong>Australia</strong>, while <strong>France</strong> have confirmed their first two cases. Additionally, the <strong>US</strong> are reportedly preparing for a charter flight to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan; similarly, measures have been touted for UK citizens, though nothing is confirmed for either group as of yet. France and Japan have expressed a desire to do the same as well.</li><li>Other countries with reported cases thus far include: Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal and Canada</li><li>(16:50 GMT) The CDC later announced that no further cases have been seen in the US, and that there is currently no evidence of transmission from imported goods, whilst at this stage the immediate risk to the US is low&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>*VIRUS’ DEVELOPMENT</strong></p><ul><li>China’s Minister of National Health Commission Xiaowei has stated that the virus, which differs from SARS, can be contagious throughout its incubation period; a period which averages 10-days but can vary from 1-14, with authorities adding that they do not yet have the virus fully under control.</li><li>Clinical trials are currently progressing using ritonavir and lopinavir, anti-HIV drugs, as a potential treatment; but the Health Commission still states that there is not an effective anti-viral treatment. US Officials have remarked that, at present, there is currently no vaccine for the virus.</li><li>China’s Finance Ministry and National Health Commission also offered CNY 60.3bln in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</li></ul><p><strong>*LUNAR NEW YEAR EXTENSION</strong></p><ul><li><strong>China has announced that the Lunar New Year holiday will be extended by an additional 3-days</strong>. At present, <strong>it is unclear if financial markets in the region</strong> will re-open on Friday once the original holiday period has concluded or remain closed until Monday in-line with the extension to the holiday period itself.</li><li>While a significant move by the Chinese Government, designed to stem the spread of the virus during the heighted period of travel, it is a step which has taken place before. In 2003, due to the SARS outbreak, the May market holiday was extended by an additional 4-days.</li><li>In terms of quarantines, according to the Beijing News, Beijing will not be instigating a lockdown of the city; wearing masks is now mandatory. Additionally, as of today, all tour group businesses are to be suspended in Beijing. CNBC’s Yoon, over the weekend, noted that China has imposed travel restrictions to Beijing – suspending inter-provincial road passenger transport from Sunday.</li></ul><p><strong>*MARKET IMPACT</strong></p><ul><li>Impact in APAC is somewhat clouded by the number of market closures, but the bourses that are open have been under significant pressure due to the virus; <strong>Nikkei 225</strong> (-1.9%) for instance.</li><li>Additionally, a safe-haven bid is present across the <strong>JPY</strong>, <strong>debt</strong> complex and <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong>, albeit are all off overnight highs. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures are down in excess of USD 1/bbl thus far as demand related concerns continue to weigh on the complex. Saudi Oil Minister Abdulaziz has downplayed the virus impact, stating that OPEC+ is flexible to respond market needs as is necessary.</li><li><strong>Luxury and travel names have been most significantly impacted</strong> within Europe with the Stoxx 600 travel &amp; leisure sector down in excess of 2% as is the broader consumer discretionary sector. As have energy Co’s, in-line with the complex’s price action.</li><li>Hong Kong Chief Executive Lam has upgraded their alter level to its highest position and has stated the virus has the potential to extended Hong Kong’s recession throughout 2020. Additionally, a housing estate which the Government commented may be used as a possible quarantine facility if necessary was set on fire by the City’s protestors. Public Sector staff, including medical staff, have threatened to go on strike unless the mainland border is shut.</li></ul><p><strong>*CHINA IMPACT</strong></p><ul><li>The scale on China is, as aforementioned, hard to determine. Government data for the Lunar New Year thus-far provides some indication. Railway Transport on Saturday 25th was -42% YY, passenger flights -42% YY and overall transport -29% YY.</li><li>As a comparison measure, the 2003 SARS outbreak equated to a 11.1% impact on Q1 growth while Q2 saw a 9.1% impact; however, analysts note that consumption and services which are being severely impacted by the coronavirus are a much more significant contributor to the economy than it was in 2003., FT. With the services sector now equating to 54% of GDP vs. 42% of GDP in 2003 and as such the impact is likely to be more substantial., Danske Bank.</li><li>Impact may also be exacerbated due to the virus striking in the midst of a prolonged trade war with the US, which has already weakened the Chinese economy.</li><li>GDP could see a reduction of as much as 1ppt in H1 and may well prompt a number of stimulus measures by the Chinese Government., Danske Bank. Overall, the severity of the virus is difficult to determine with the length at which it remains significant issue for China/world and the driving theme for markets likely to be the main determinants for ramifications both in China and globally.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The move higher in the T-Note coincided with Spoos being offered (falling beneath 3200) in the latter part of the European session, the move lower in yields was exacerbated following the US PMIs, which were by no means disastrous, appeared more of an obstacle for participants to get out the way before moving into Treasuries ahead of the weekend – where concerns linger on the threats posed globally by the coronavirus. Note that some heavy block trades were noted after the T-Note passed the 130-00 level; some analysts note a slew of short covering as prices move closer to concentrated option strikes, specifically 130-16 and 130-25, although the key 1.67% figure in the 10-year yield served as resistance for the benchmark, but loomed close in the tail end of the day. By settlement, the Treasury curve had bull-flattened, where the 2s10s fell just beneath the 20bps figure: 2-year yield down 2bps and 10-year yield down 5bps.

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Increased coronavirus fears and mass holiday closures weigh on Asia-Pac sentiment",
        "content": "<p>A broad risk-averse tone resumed across asset classes to start the new week which follows on from last Friday’s declines on Wall St where the S&amp;P 500 posted its worst weekly performance since August amid ongoing coronavirus fears with the number of confirmed cases stateside now at 5. Furthermore, the latest official update stated the number of infected in China rose to 2744 with the death toll at 80, and China had also warned that the coronavirus is getting stronger and the number of cases could increase. This heavily pressured US equity futures which slipped around 1% in early trade and spurred safe-haven bids for T-notes and gold, while Nikkei 225 (-1.9%) was down by as much as 2.00% due to the outbreak fears and detrimental currency flows, against the backdrop of thinned conditions with nearly all major bourses in the region closed for holiday.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is uneventful and holds on to most of Friday’s gains which were spurred amid safe-haven flows and due to weakness in its major counterparts including EUR/USD and GBP/USD which fell below 1.1050 and 1.3100 respectively. However, the single currency has since found mild reprieve after League party leader Salvini’s threat to evict Italy’s fragile coalition government hit a snag as his party is seen to have failed to win the key regional election in Emilia Romagna, while GBP/USD remains subdued near its 200-Hour MA of 1.3059 heading into the Brexit date this Friday. Elsewhere, USD/JPY fell below 109.00 due to the risk-averse tone and antipodeans were also pressured by the downbeat sentiment, as well as their exposure to China and weakness in CNH.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned on safe-haven buying due to the coronavirus jitters which also spurred T-notes to gap higher by about 10 ticks at the re-open, although the upward momentum for JGBs has petered out amid the lack of BoJ presence in the market and absence of most regional participants.</p>",
