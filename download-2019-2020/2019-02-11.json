Also reports in Politico suggested that President Trump&#39;s strong desire to get a market-boosting deal suggests he is not likely to allow talks to collapse in ways that would more than double tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese exports to the U.S. on March 2, although Trump may be willing to allow it if China does not offer much to the US in Beijing this week. In regard to the March 1st deadline, a senior official said that if Trump and Xi agreed on an extension over the phone, the two leaders would likely stage a summit later in the month; Chinese officials later proposed that they meet on the island of Hainan - close to the Boao Forum for Asia - between March 26th-29th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier reiterated that following meetings with the Irish and the British, the Brexit deal will not be reopened and it is his understanding UK PM May is not seeking an extension of article 50. However, Barnier said he was interested in UK opposition leader Corbyn&rsquo;s Brexit letter, which adhered for a customs union and the UK being aligned with the Single Market; Barnier also said the EU has moved towards British positions in the existing deal, particularly the Irish backstop. Looking ahead, UK PM May is to update the House of Commons tomorrow on the progress she has made on Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.31 LOWER AT USD 52.41/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.59 LOWER AT USD 61.51/BBL. </strong>In the US pre-market, there was a constructive risk tone which saw equity futures in positive territory. However, the crude complex did not want to participate, breaking last week&#39;s dynamic where oil took its cue from stock indices. Desks were struggling to provide a convincing narrative as to why crude was lagging; some had suggested that comments from the UAE (expect markets to reach a balance in Q1, noted excellent compliance, and suggested there was little more that OPEC and its partners needed to do to balance the market). Elsewhere, desks attributed USD strength (fresh YTD highs for the DXY) for the softness in crude. Near the European close, it was reported that Venezuela&#39;s PDVSA has been issued licenses by the US Treasury authorising some transactions, which may have been known to market participants earlier; Venezuela continues to try and sell more crude to India, despite questions of whether it will be able to deliver. &quot;Production has been trending lower over the past two years and there are fresh forecasts in circulation that have output falling from its recent 1.2 mmbpd rate to 0.7 mmbpd or less for 2020,&quot; Citi said. On the note of compliance, attention will be on this week&#39;s monthly reports from EIA, OPEC and IEA; while compliance is generally good across the board, some have noted that Iraq is an outlier. &quot;Platts reported that Iraq&rsquo;s January crude production grew by 110kb/d to 4.575mb/d, above Iraq&rsquo;s quota of 4.513mb/d under the OPEC+ agreement,&quot; UBS notes, &quot;monthly reports released tomorrow and Wednesday by the EIA, OPEC and the IEA should reassure that enough is being done to avoid an excessively loose market,&quot; and argues that &quot;the near-term risk is that supply/demand balances over-tighten as planned and unplanned cuts double up, which should offset all but the most extreme demand decline scenarios and keep the oil price moving higher.&quot; This week&rsquo;s inventories see crude building by 2.3mln, distillates drawing by 1.1mln, gasoline building 0.5mln and cushing building 0.031mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Bowan (Voter) stated that both the US economy and the Fed&#39;s policy are in a good place, adding that she is comfortable with the current stance of policy. She continues to see great job numbers and solid wage growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.07% at 2710, NASDAQ -0.06% at 6909, DJI -0.22% at 25053. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.45%, Materials +0.16%, Industrials +0.54%, Cons Discretionary +0.17%, Cons Staples +0.20%, Healthcare -0.14%, Financials +0.25%, Tech 0.00%, Telecoms -0.63%, Utilities -0.09%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Electronic Arts (EA) outperformed at the open as investors turn optimistic on its new Apex Legends game as well as an upgrade at BAML, but pared back gains into the close; competitor Activision Blizzard (ATVI) underperformed amidst job cuts and ahead of its earnings tomorrow, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) also traded lower. Loews (L) underperformed after reporting a loss and disappointing revenue. Norfolk Southern (NSC) surged on announcement of a new strategic plan to increase its profitability. Tesla (TSLA) opened higher after an upgrade at Canaccord. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT) traded lower following downgrades at Argus and Longbow. Salesforce.com (CRM) benefitted from a stake increase from Daniel Loeb&rsquo;s Third Point. NuVasive (NUVA) opened higher after the UK-based Smith &amp; Nephew announced plans to acquire it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 8 TICKS LOWER AT 122-04.</strong> US Treasury futures sold off on Monday as investors await on Wednesday&rsquo;s crucial CPI data for January, where a strong print could tilt a data-dependent Fed to a more hawkish stance. The sell off was exacerbated going into the US equity open, with positive China-US trade comments from White House Advisor Kelly Conway and a block sale of 8k+ TUH9 by a real money account. Treasuries continued selling off through the session where nine investment grade issuances flooded the market. Looking at the curve on the close, most of the actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps. Spreads were mixed where there was steepening in the front-end with 2s/5s widening by 0.8bps, whilst spreads at the belly to long-end flattened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The Dollar is now firmer vs all G10 counterparts, and the index moved ahead of 97.000 to set a new 2019 peak at 97.123, breaching the bullish chart objective at 97.116.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The major laggard all day, and extending losses across the board ahead of the return of Japanese markets from National Foundation Day. Usd/Jpy saw buy-stops once 110.16 was cleared (last Monday&rsquo;s high) and rallied to a fresh ytd pinnacle of 110.45, just shy of 31 December 2018&rsquo;s peak, while Jpy crosses continues to climb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CHF: </strong>The Pound and Franc are vying for the dubious honour of next biggest G10 loser as Cable let go of the 1.2900 handle and fell below the 100 DMA (circa 1.2892) to retest lows not seen since last Thursday&rsquo;s BoE minutes and QIR (1.2868 vs 1.2857 respectively). The catalysts beyond bearish techs, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker than forecast UK data. Conversely, Swiss CPI matched consensus, but the Chf weakened vs the Usd, albeit not to the extent that it did overnight when Japan holiday impacted trading volumes exacerbated a sharp slide &ndash; Usd/Chf now around 1.0040 vs almost 1.0100 at one stage and 0.9900 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, EUR, AUD: </strong>The next weakest links, with the Nok undermined softer than expected Norwegian inflation data, albeit off worst levels vs the Eur as the single currency also depreciated, cross currently around 9.8100 from almost 9.8400. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd lost grip of 1.1300 and the 30 DMA at 1.1296 on its way to a marginal new base for the year at 1.1282 vs 1.1289 previously before gleaning some traction. The Aud reversed early overnight gains made in part with the aid of firm iron ore prices, and got to within a few pips of last week&rsquo;s post-RBA Lowe and SOMP lows vs the Usd at 0.7065, while the Aud/Nzd cross slipped back below 1.0500, as the Kiwi remained above its 100 DMA vs the Usd (0.6725), albeit just within a 0.6773-32 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Broad losses vs the buoyant Buck, but with the Rouble deriving some underlying support from Moody&rsquo;s Russian ratings upgrade, in stark contrast to the Rand that is also under pressure due to Eskom issues. Usd/Rub sub-65.7000 and Usd/Zar around 13.7500 vs highs and lows of 65.7810 and 13.5880 respectively.</p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>In the US pre-market, there was a constructive risk tone which saw equity futures in positive territory. However, the crude complex did not want to participate, breaking last week&#39;s dynamic where oil took its cue from stock indices. Desks were struggling to provide a convincing narrative as to why crude was lagging; some had suggested that comments from the UAE (expect markets to reach a balance in Q1, noted excellent compliance, and suggested there was little more that OPEC and its partners needed to do to balance the market). Elsewhere, desks attributed USD strength (fresh YTD highs for the DXY) for the softness in crude. Near the European close, it was reported that Venezuela&#39;s PDVSA has been issued licenses by the US Treasury authorising some transactions, which may have been known to market participants earlier; Venezuela continues to try and sell more crude to India, despite questions of whether it will be able to deliver. &quot;Production has been trending lower over the past two years and there are fresh forecasts in circulation that have output falling from its recent 1.2 mmbpd rate to 0.7 mmbpd or less for 2020,&quot; Citi said. On the note of compliance, attention will be on this week&#39;s monthly reports from EIA, OPEC and IEA; while compliance is generally good across the board, some have noted that Iraq is an outlier. &quot;Platts reported that Iraq&rsquo;s January crude production grew by 110kb/d to 4.575mb/d, above Iraq&rsquo;s quota of 4.513mb/d under the OPEC+ agreement,&quot; UBS notes, &quot;monthly reports released tomorrow and Wednesday by the EIA, OPEC and the IEA should reassure that enough is being done to avoid an excessively loose market,&quot; and argues that &quot;the near-term risk is that supply/demand balances over-tighten as planned and unplanned cuts double up, which should offset all but the most extreme demand decline scenarios and keep the oil price moving higher.&quot;</p>\r\n",

Next bullish chart objective is 97.116, and the Greenback could easily advance further given more pronounced weakness elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major laggard all day, and extending losses across the board ahead of the return of Japanese markets from National Foundation Day. Usd/Jpy saw buy-stops once 110.16 was cleared (last Monday&rsquo;s high) and rallied to a fresh ytd pinnacle of 110.45, just shy of 31 December 2018&rsquo;s peak, while Jpy crosses continues to climb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound and Franc are vying for the dubious honour of next biggest G10 loser as Cable let go of the 1.2900 handle and fell below the 100 DMA (circa 1.2892) to retest lows not seen since last Thursday&rsquo;s BoE minutes and QIR (1.2868 vs 1.2857 respectively). The catalysts beyond bearish techs, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker than forecast UK data. Conversely, Swiss CPI matched consensus, but the Chf weakened vs the Usd, albeit not to the extent that it did overnight when Japan holiday impacted trading volumes exacerbated a sharp slide &ndash; Usd/Chf now around 1.0040 vs almost 1.0100 at one stage and 0.9900 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/EUR/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next weakest links, with the Nok undermined softer than expected Norwegian inflation data, albeit off worst levels vs the Eur as the single currency also depreciated, cross currently around 9.8100 from almost 9.8400. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd lost grip of 1.1300 and the 30 DMA at 1.1296 on its way to a marginal new base for the year at 1.1282 vs 1.1289 previously before gleaning some traction. The Aud reversed early overnight gains made in part with the aid of firm iron ore prices, and got to within a few pips of last week&rsquo;s post-RBA Lowe and SOMP lows vs the Usd at 0.7065, while the Aud/Nzd cross slipped back below 1.0500, as the Kiwi remained above its 100 DMA vs the Usd (0.6725), albeit just within a 0.6773-32 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broad losses vs the buoyant Buck, but with the Rouble deriving some underlying support from Moody&rsquo;s Russian ratings upgrade, in stark contrast to the Rand that is also under pressure due to Eskom issues. Usd/Rub sub-65.7000 and Usd/Zar around 13.7500 vs highs and lows of 65.7810 and 13.5880 respectively.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) was negative with the index dragged by losses in the top-weighted financials sector and with focus on several corporate updates, while the absence of Japanese markets for National Founding Day has contributed to the uninspiring tone. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp.

Furthermore, it was separately reported that bipartisan talks over the weekend regarding funding for the border wall is said to have reached a stalemate ahead of this week&rsquo;s government shutdown deadline. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has agreed to talks with Labour leader Corbyn regarding a soft Brexit according to The Telegraph, although it was separately reported that UK PM May rejected a pivot towards a Brexit customs union compromise. Nonetheless, should May engage in discussions with Corbyn on entering into a customs union, The Times reports that this could see the PM lose support from some members of her cabinet. (Telegraph/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May spokesman says PM May will made a statement to Parliament tomorrow, not on Wednesday.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Major European Indices are in the green [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.8%], strengthening from the mixed trade seen in Asia overnight. FTSE MIB (+1.5%) is the outperforming index largely due to strength in banking names, with Banco BPM (+7.2%), BPER Banca (+5.6%), UBI Banca (+3.5%) and Intesa Sanpaolo (+1.9%) in the green following ECB SREP capital requirement updates. Following this, all sectors are higher with some outperformance seen in the financial sector. Other notable movers include Smith &amp; Nephew (-4.8%) who are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600, after reports that the Co. are to acquire NuVasive in a deal worth over USD 3bln. Elsewhere, Euronext (+0.6%) have been choppy after they increased their offer for Oslo Bors; who have stated they still prefer a takeover by Nasdaq. Just Eat (+2.1%) are in the green as shareholder Cat Rock Capital have stated the Co. should engage in merger discussions. In terms of US premarket news, Apple&rsquo;s iPhone shipments to China decreased by an estimated 20% in Q4 as Huawei&rsquo;s grip on the market strengthened; the Co. are up by around 0.3% in the pre-market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar remains underpinned heading in to the next round of US-China trade talks, and with further impetus derived from ongoing weakness in rival currencies. The DXY has inched higher as a result and is now testing nearest resistance around 96.809 ahead of 97.000 and the next upside chart target at 97.116.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The G10 underperformer and major mover, partly due to thinner trading conditions overnight as Japanese markets were shut for National Foundation Day. However, the Jpy was also hit by cross demand and the headline pair has subsequently cleared last Monday&rsquo;s 110.16 high that had been containing gains to trade up at 110.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/NOK- Also considerably weaker, but the Franc has recovered relatively well from an abrupt slide to almost 1.1000 vs the Usd and back through 1.1400 vs the Eur as a combination of stops and model-driven buy orders were triggered in the aforementioned illiquid holiday impacted Asian session, with some talk that the move could have been prompted by an erroneous trade. Note, the Chf largely shrugged off in line Swiss CPI in stark contrast to Sterling and the Norwegian Krona that both extended losses in wake of data (GDP, IP, manufacturing and construction output in the case of the former, and inflation for the latter). Indeed, Cable fell from circa 1.2955 to around 1.2895 and only a few pips from the 100 DMA (1.2892), while Eur/Nok climbed to just shy of 9.8400 vs sub-9.7700 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Notwithstanding the cross Jpy demand noted above, the single currency has dipped under 1.1300 vs the Greenback to test bids/support around key downside chart levels at 1.1296 (30 DMA) and 1.1289 (current 2019 low). No fresh bearish catalyst or new driver, but the Eur is still being undermined by slowing Eurozone growth, inflation and political jitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK - All bucking the overall trend and/or holding up better vs broadly firm Usd, with the Kiwi gleaning some encouragement after keeping its head above the 100 DMA (0.6725) to probe above 0.6750 and the 200 DMA (0.6756), but unable to clear 0.6775. Meanwhile, the Aud continues to consolidate after last week&rsquo;s heavy RBA-related losses, and hover just under 0.7100/1.0500 vs its US and NZ counterparts, and the Swedish Krona has rebounded above 10.5000 vs the Eur amidst relative gains vs its Scandinavian peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUB - The Rouble has been choppy between 65.3975 and 65.7655, with initial strength seen following Moody&rsquo;s ratings upgrade whittled away by the generally bid Usd and another dip in Brent crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core 10 year EU bonds have pared losses, with Gilts reclaiming 124.00 with a little more conviction in wake of the raft of mostly weaker than forecast UK data, while Bunds may have taken some solace from holding above last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex base to trade back over 166.40, albeit just as EU equities remain firm and Italian BTPs even firmer than they were earlier (126.50 new high). Elsewhere, US Treasuries have slipped from overnight session peaks and the curve is fractionally steeper ahead of a speech by Fed&rsquo;s Bowman, and potentially more data in the form of Q4 labour costs and productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.3%) and WTI (-0.9%) prices have weakened on the cautious risk tone ahead of this week&rsquo;s US-China trade talks. In terms of recent news flow UAE Energy Minister Al Mazroui has stated that the OPEC+ compliance was excellent in January, he sees a balanced oil market in Q1 2019 and no further action is required by OPEC+. In spite of Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes Rig Count which saw oil rigs increase by 7, adding to the concern that record US production will hamper the OPEC+ production cuts. Separately, the Venezuelan Oil Minister stated that their oil output is currently at 1.57mln BPD, and the country are looking to expand their cooperation with India. Looking ahead OPEC are due to release their monthly oil report tomorrow, which includes January production estimates; separately, the IEA are to release their report on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.5%) prices are weighed on by dollar strength, in spite of the uncertain risk tone seen overnight ahead of US-China trade talks. Elsewhere, iron ore futures have jumped up by over 8% today as China returns to the market following the holiday period for Chinese New Year. Separately, UBS say the iron ore market faces a deficit of 30mln tonnes due to the Vale dam collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UBS said iron ore market faces deficit of 30mln tons due to Vale crisis.

FTSE MIB (+1.7%) is the outperforming index largely due to strength in banking names, with Banco BPM (+6.9%), BPER Banca (+5.6%), UBI Banca (+3.7%) and Intesa Sanpaolo (+2.0%) in the green following ECB SREP capital requirement updates. Following this, all sectors are higher with some outperformance seen in the financial sector. Other notable movers include Smith &amp; Nephew (-3.7%) who are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600, after reports that the Co. are to acquire NuVasive in a deal worth over USD 3bln. Elsewhere, Euronext (+0.3%) have been choppy after they increased their offer for Oslo Bors; who have stated they still prefer a takeover by Nasdaq. Just Eat (+2.0%) are in the green as shareholder Cat Rock Capital have stated the Co. should engage in merger discussions. In terms of US premarket news, Apple&rsquo;s iPhone shipments to China decreased by an estimated 20% in Q4 as Huawei&rsquo;s grip on the market strengthened; the Co. are up by around 0.3% in the pre-market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar remains underpinned heading in to the next round of US-China trade talks, and with further impetus derived from ongoing weakness in rival currencies. The DXY has inched higher as a result and is now testing nearest resistance around 96.809 ahead of 97.000 and the next upside chart target at 97.116.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The G10 underperformer and major mover, partly due to thinner trading conditions overnight as Japanese markets were shut for National Foundation Day. However, the Jpy was also hit by cross demand and the headline pair has subsequently cleared last Monday&rsquo;s 110.16 high that had been containing gains to trade up at 110.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/NOK- Also considerably weaker, but the Franc has recovered relatively well from an abrupt slide to almost 1.1000 vs the Usd and back through 1.1400 vs the Eur as a combination of stops and model-driven buy orders were triggered in the aforementioned illiquid holiday impacted Asian session, with some talk that the move could have been prompted by an erroneous trade. Note, the Chf largely shrugged off in line Swiss CPI in stark contrast to Sterling and the Norwegian Krona that both extended losses in wake of data (GDP, IP, manufacturing and construction output in the case of the former, and inflation for the latter). Indeed, Cable fell from circa 1.2955 to around 1.2895 and only a few pips from the 100 DMA (1.2892), while Eur/Nok climbed to just shy of 9.8400 vs sub-9.7700 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Notwithstanding the cross Jpy demand noted above, the single currency has dipped under 1.1300 vs the Greenback to test bids/support around key downside chart levels at 1.1296 (30 DMA) and 1.1289 (current 2019 low). No fresh bearish catalyst or new driver, but the Eur is still being undermined by slowing Eurozone growth, inflation and political jitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK - All bucking the overall trend and/or holding up better vs broadly firm Usd, with the Kiwi gleaning some encouragement after keeping its head above the 100 DMA (0.6725) to probe above 0.6750 and the 200 DMA (0.6756), but unable to clear 0.6775. Meanwhile, the Aud continues to consolidate after last week&rsquo;s heavy RBA-related losses, and hover just under 0.7100/1.0500 vs its US and NZ counterparts, and the Swedish Krona has rebounded above 10.5000 vs the Eur amidst relative gains vs its Scandinavian peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUB - The Rouble has been choppy between 65.3975 and 65.7655, with initial strength seen following Moody&rsquo;s ratings upgrade whittled away by the generally bid Usd and another dip in Brent crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core 10 year EU bonds have pared losses, with Gilts reclaiming 124.00 with a little more conviction in wake of the raft of mostly weaker than forecast UK data, while Bunds may have taken some solace from holding above last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex base to trade back over 166.40, albeit just as EU equities remain firm and Italian BTPs even firmer than they were earlier (126.50 new high). Elsewhere, US Treasuries have slipped from overnight session peaks and the curve is fractionally steeper ahead of a speech by Fed&rsquo;s Bowman, and potentially more data in the form of Q4 labour costs and productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.3%) and WTI (-0.9%) prices have weakened on the cautious risk tone ahead of this week&rsquo;s US-China trade talks. In terms of recent news flow UAE Energy Minister Al Mazroui has stated that the OPEC+ compliance was excellent in January, he sees a balanced oil market in Q1 2019 and no further action is required by OPEC+. In spite of Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes Rig Count which saw oil rigs increase by 7, adding to the concern that record US production will hamper the OPEC+ production cuts. Separately, the Venezuelan Oil Minister stated that their oil output is currently at 1.57mln BPD, and the country are looking to expand their cooperation with India. Looking ahead OPEC are due to release their monthly oil report tomorrow, which includes January production estimates; separately, the IEA are to release their report on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.5%) prices are weighed on by dollar strength, in spite of the uncertain risk tone seen overnight ahead of US-China trade talks. Elsewhere, iron ore futures have jumped up by over 8% today as China returns to the market following the holiday period for Chinese New Year. Separately, UBS say the iron ore market faces a deficit of 30mln tonnes due to the Vale dam collapse.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar remains underpinned heading in to the next round of US-China trade talks, and with further impetus derived from ongoing weakness in rival currencies. The DXY has inched higher as a result and is now testing nearest resistance around 96.809 ahead of 97.000 and the next upside chart target at 97.116.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G10 underperformer and major mover, partly due to thinner trading conditions overnight as Japanese markets were shut for National Foundation Day. However, the Jpy was also hit by cross demand and the headline pair has subsequently cleared last Monday&rsquo;s 110.16 high that had been containing gains to trade up at 110.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also considerably weaker, but the Franc has recovered relatively well from an abrupt slide to almost 1.1000 vs the Usd and back through 1.1400 vs the Eur as a combination of stops and model-driven buy orders were triggered in the aforementioned illiquid holiday impacted Asian session, with some talk that the move could have been prompted by an erroneous trade. Note, the Chf largely shrugged off in line Swiss CPI in stark contrast to Sterling and the Norwegian Krona that both extended losses in wake of data (GDP, IP, manufacturing and construction output in the case of the former, and inflation for the latter). Indeed, Cable fell from circa 1.2955 to around 1.2895 and only a few pips from the 100 DMA (1.2892), while Eur/Nok climbed to just shy of 9.8400 vs sub-9.7700 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding the cross Jpy demand noted above, the single currency has dipped under 1.1300 vs the Greenback to test bids/support around key downside chart levels at 1.1296 (30 DMA) and 1.1289 (current 2019 low). No fresh bearish catalyst or new driver, but the Eur is still being undermined by slowing Eurozone growth, inflation and political jitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All bucking the overall trend and/or holding up better vs broadly firm Usd, with the Kiwi gleaning some encouragement after keeping its head above the 100 DMA (0.6725) to probe above 0.6750 and the 200 DMA (0.6756), but unable to clear 0.6775. Meanwhile, the Aud continues to consolidate after last week&rsquo;s heavy RBA-related losses, and hover just under 0.7100/1.0500 vs its US and NZ counterparts, and the Swedish Krona has rebounded above 10.5000 vs the Eur amidst relative gains vs its Scandinavian peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUB &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rouble has been choppy between 65.3975 and 65.7655, with initial strength seen following Moody&rsquo;s ratings upgrade whittled away by the generally bid Usd and another dip in Brent crude prices.</p>\r\n",

However, it remains to be seen whether the pull-back in Bunds and uptick in yields is transitory or a more meaningful retracement. Bunds currently near the bottom of a 166.49-73 range vs Friday&rsquo;s 166.75 Eurex close and the 166.83 intraday peak, while 10 year cash is hovering just below 0.10%.

ASX 200 (-0.2%) was negative with the index dragged by losses in the top-weighted financials sector and with focus on several corporate updates, while the absence of Japanese markets for National Founding Day has contributed to the uninspiring tone. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) were initially choppy on China&rsquo;s return from the week-long closure amid trade-related uncertainty and expectations of a drain in liquidity which is typically the case following the Lunar New Year holidays, although mainland stocks later found support in tandem with outperformance in Shenzhen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 20bln, while there were separate reports that over CNY 1.0tln of PBoC lending operations will expire this week. (Newswires/China Securities Journal)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7495 (Prev. 6.7081)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China GDP is expected to slow to 6.3% for this year, while it was also suggested that Q1 GDP may slow to 6.0% which would be the weakest start to the year on record. (China Daily/FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&#39;s advisers are said to have informally discussed holding a summit at Mar-a-Lago next month with Chinese President Xi as part of an attempt to end the trade dispute. Separately, there were reports on Friday that the China trade deadline of March 1st could move according to a senior administration official. (Axios/CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer to go to China for trade meetings on February 14-15 and deputy-level talks are to begin on February 11. In related news, there were reports that many of the concessions Beijing is offering appear to be rehashes of measures previously announced. (Newswires/Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has agreed to talks with Labour leader Corbyn regarding a soft Brexit according to The Telegraph, although it was separately reported that UK PM May rejected a pivot towards a Brexit customs union compromise. Nonetheless, should May engage in discussions with Corbyn on entering into a customs union, The Times reports that this could see the PM lose support from some members of her cabinet. (Telegraph/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar said on balance he believes a deal can be secured but is unsure if it can be done by the end of March or after an extension. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A leading thinktank, The Institute for Fiscal Studies, has revealed that UK Chancellor Hammond will need to find an extra GBP 5bln this year to meet his claims of ending austerity. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK and Switzerland have struck an agreement that will allow the two nations to trade without any additional tariffs after the UK leaves the EU. (Newswires) Elsewhere, Italy is forming emergency plans to safeguard financial stability and keep trade with the UK flowing even if there is a no-deal Brexit. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s coalition government is reportedly in sharp disagreement over protecting the Bank of Italy&rsquo;s independence after central bankers issued more pessimistic economic growth forecasts this year. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fitch affirmed Greece at BB-, Outlook Stable. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remained firm and in proximity to its YTD highs as its counterparts traded mixed with EUR/USD and GBP/USD at the bottom halves of the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively, while antipodeans outperformed but have much further to go to recover from the aftermath of the RBA&rsquo;s recent dovish shift to its rate outlook and poor New Zealand jobs data. Elsewhere, price action in USD/JPY was initially contained by the lack of Japanese participants before a slight improvement in risk tone provided some mild support, while CHF began the day volatile in which an early mini flash-crash saw the currency weaken by 1% which some attributed to stops being taken out amid thin liquidity, although the move was later pared given the lack of news catalysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities mostly weakened amid the cautious risk tone overnight which pressured WTI crude futures towards the USD 52.00/bbl level where it has found some support. Elsewhere, gold prices saw mild losses as the greenback held near last week&rsquo;s best levels and copper failed to benefit from China&rsquo;s return to the market as trade uncertainty and US shutdown concerns dampened broader market sentiment, while Dalian iron ore futures bucked the trend as they played catch up to global prices and hit limit up shortly after the open on Vale-related supply concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (8/Feb): Total rigs +4 at 1059; oil rigs +7 at 854; gas rigs -3 at 195.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the movement in the T-Note was sideways on Friday, with a slight upward bias, inspired by the usual cocktail of lingering concerns over US/China trade, and global growth. A brief dip in the pre-market was attributed to dealers unloading auction long positions, while Bunds were providing some influence in early trade too. Profit-taking at the end of the European day saw some of the gains pared back to leave the T-Note 3 ticks higher at settlement. Major curve spreads were mixed, but generally +/- 1bps at settle. US T-note futures (H9) settled +3 ticks at 122-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted a comment that suggested he is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency, while he also noted that Border Committee Democrats are all of a sudden behaving irrationally. Furthermore, it was separately reported that bipartisan talks over the weekend regarding funding for the border wall is said to have reached a stalemate ahead of this week&rsquo;s government shutdown deadline.

Furthermore, Daly commented that the Fed is discussing whether QE should be used only in emergencies or more readily and that patience is data-dependent not time-dependent. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week with a tentative tone following the mixed performance of their US peers on Friday and with participants also cautious ahead of this week&rsquo;s US-China trade discussions, while a stalemate regarding border wall funding has also spurred fresh US government shutdown fears. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is negative with the index dragged by losses in the top-weighted financials sector and with focus also on several corporate updates, while the absence of Japanese markets for National Founding Day has also contributed to the uninspiring tone. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) trade choppy on the mainland&rsquo;s return from the week-long closure amid trade-related uncertainty and expectations of a drain in liquidity which is typically the case following the Lunar New Year holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and sits in proximity to its YTD highs as its counterparts trade mixed, with EUR/USD and GBP/USD at the bottom halves of the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively, while antipodeans outperform but have much further to go to recover from last week&rsquo;s drop in the aftermath of the RBA&rsquo;s dovish shift to its rate outlook and poor New Zealand jobs data. Elsewhere, price action in USD/JPY is contained by the lack of Japanese participants and CHF began the day volatile as an early flash crash saw the currency weaken by 1% which some attributed to stops being taken out amid thin liquidity, although the move was later pared given the lack of news catalysts.</p>\r\n",
