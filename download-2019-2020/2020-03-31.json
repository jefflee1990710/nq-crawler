(Twitter)</p><p>NIH’s Fauci said we are starting to see some glimmers that social distancing measures are working within the US and are beginning to see people in their 30's and 40's becoming seriously ill, while he added cases are still rising and situation remains dangerous. (Newswires)</p><p>Texas Governor issued a Stay at Home order in which all Texans are to stay at home except for exceptional business. (Newswires)</p><p>Italy COVID-19 cases rose to 105,792 (prev. 101,739) and death toll increased by 837 to 12,428. There were also comments from Italy's National Health Institute head that the number of virus deaths could be understated. (Newswires)</p><p>UK COVID-19 number of cases rose to 25,150 (prev. 22,141) and the death toll rose to 1,801 (prev. 1,408). There were also comments by UK Cabinet Minister Gove that there may be some signs that the curve may be flattened, but now is not the time to ease social distancing measures.

(Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Mester (voter, hawk) said an unemployment rate above 10% is feasible because economic activity is being shut down to stop the spread of the virus, while she expects some very bad numbers for the economy but added that the situation can improve when we get to the other side. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Daly (non-voter, dovish) said she expects the economy to get worse before it gets better and already believes US is in a recession, while she added that what the Fed does depends on the evolution of the virus and that it is prepared to do whatever is required within its powers. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump is to suspend certain tariffs payments for 90-days on imports such as apparel and light trucks, although it will not include some of the high-profile tariffs including the metals tariffs and punitive tariffs on USD 360bln of imports from China. (FT)&nbsp;</p><p>US President Trump administration is not on track for the new USMCA to fully go into effect as planned on 1st June, making it likely that automakers will have extra time to prepare to comply with the deal's new rules, according to Politico citing sources. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks fared weaker on Tuesday after paring earlier strength, again seemingly moving to their own rhythm as news flow remained relatively light. Many desks have attributed Monday's rally to month-end rebalancing; Citi notes that turnover was relatively low, and that relative sectors within the broader S&amp;P 500 are sending concerning signals: cyclicals have started to underperform defensive sectors, and Citi notes that over the past year, this has preceded market corrections. Citi said it is sceptical that risk assets continue to rally once month-end is out of the way. Energy stocks (XOP, XLE) were the best performing sector after being offered heavily on Monday, alongside a reprieve in oil prices. Conagra Brands (CAG) was an outperformer after it said it would exceed tis FY guidance. Domino’s (DPZ) was offered after a poor preliminary Q1 SSS growth update. Dollar Tree (DLTR) traded lower as it pulled guidance, citing uncertainties. Airlines (UAL, AAL, DAL) had a strong day as the group moves closer to securing the latest government stimulus package. SPX -1.51% at 2587, NDX -0.96% at 7814, DJIA -1.84% at 21,917.</p><p>The TPLEX was little changed on Tuesday, excluding the long end, which was weaker by settlement. The Fed remains the main buyer in town across the curve, and similar to Monday, its completion of purchases in the belly earlier on in the session saw yields rise off their lows heading into settlement, although by no means drastically, as desks note a supply drought as gauged by lower take-up in the Fed’s Treasury purchases on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Fed’s RRP operation continued to balloon while the regular repo ops saw miniscule take-up. The IG slate continues to let it rip, albeit less pronounced than Monday (IFR noted March as the largest volume month ever with USD 256.47bln in supply), while Israel came to the SSA market (10s, 30s, 100s). By settlement, yields were relatively unchanged, if not higher at the long end, 2s +1bps at 0.238%, 10s +3bps at 0.702%, 30s +7.5bps at 1.359%. T-note (M0) futures settled 4+ ticks lower at 138-22.</p>",

Supply: Germany</li></ul><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Stocks fared weaker on Tuesday after paring earlier strength, again seemingly moving to their own rhythm as new news flow remains relatively light. Many desks have attributed Monday's rally to month-end rebalancing; Citi notes that turnover was relatively low, and that relative sectors within the broader S&amp;P 500 are sending concerning signals: cyclicals have started to underperform defensive sectors, and Citi notes that over the past year, this has preceded market corrections. Citi said it is sceptical that risk assets continue to rally once month-end is out of the way. Energy stocks were the relative outperformer on the session, supported by the selling reprieve in oil prices. The Treasury curve was little changed, with the curve mainly dancing around to the tune of Fed purchases. Meanwhile, the USD peaked earlier in the session, before reversing course in the latter part of European trade.</p><h2>CASE COUNT</h2><p><strong>WORLDWIDE CASES 846,251, DEATHS 41,482, RECOVERED 176,520.</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Tuesday (via worldometer website) against Monday:</p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>total cases 180,789 (prev. 163,788), death toll 3,580 (prev. 3,141).</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 105,792 (prev. 101,739), death toll 12,428 (prev. 11,591).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 94,417 (prev. 87,956), death toll 8,269 (prev. 7,716).</li><li><strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 81,518 (prev. 81,439), death toll 3,305 (prev. 3,300).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 70,985 (prev. 66,885), death toll 682 (prev. 645).</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 52,128 (prev. 44,550), death toll 3,523 (prev. 3,024).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>total cases 25,150 (prev. 22,141), death toll 1,789 (prev. 1,408).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>total cases 16,605 (prev. 15,922), death toll 433 (prev. 359).</li><li><strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 12,595 (prev. 11,750), death toll 1,039 (prev. 864).</li><li><strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 9,786 (prev. 9,661), death toll 162 (prev. 158).</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 8,467 (prev. 7,448), death toll 95 (prev. 89).</li></ul><p><i>Note figures are provided via </i><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\"><i>worldometers</i></a><i> thus there may be some discrepancies on figures provided against those stated from individual states.</i></p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS - PART 4: </strong>White House officials have compiled lists of requests from agencies, which total around USD 600bln, sources said. The proposals reportedly include more state aid, as well as financial aid for mortgage and travel industries.<strong> </strong>US President Trump tweeted that this is the time for our long-awaited infrastructure bill, as US interest rates are at 0%; should be big and bold at USD 2trln, Trump said, focusing solely on jobs and rebuilding infrastructure.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile,<strong> </strong>Senate Majority Leader McConnell said we need to wait and see if a part 4 virus relief bill is needed, adds that pandemic-related US Treasury bonds are an 'interesting idea'.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>US President Trump said we can save more than 1mln lives by following social distancing guidelines vigorously. President Trump also stated that there are challenging times ahead for the next 30 days and that 1mln Americans have now been tested, while he suggested that a national stay at home order was unlikely. It was elsewhere reported that US President Trump could announce a 90-day deferral of some tariff payments, but will not include those imposed on China goods; this proposal has previously been suggested.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED FACILITIES: </strong>The Fed announced the offering of repo agreements to foreign central banks; will allow foreign central banks to use Treasury holdings to obtain dollars and will help broaden access for countries beyond the existing swap lines. The announcement saw some weakness in the USD as the market reacted to yet another Fed facility to alleviate any funding pressures, a new normal in the current crisis mode.</p><p><strong>ECB'S VISCO</strong> said that the Bank will not tolerate any impediments that hinder the efficacy of monetary policy transmission, adding that the Bank is prepared to increase the size of asset purchases and alter their composition and explore all potential options to provide support to the economy during the crisis. <strong>ECB'S HOLZMANN</strong> noted the idea behind the PEPP was to make liquidity rapidly available, rules for this were loosened to ensure enough assets were available for purchase; said rules on PEPP will be set in the future. Holzmann also said there are to be discussions on coronabonds in the ECB but declined to comment on this at present.</p><h2>REST OF WORLD</h2><p><strong>G20</strong> finance ministers, in a joint statement, said it has agreed on a road map to implement the commitments made by leaders; G20 reiterates the risk of debt vulnerabilities in low income countries. G20 financial officials have tasked relevant working groups with delivering on the roadmap by the April 15th meeting.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN STIMULUS:</strong> The European Commission is working on plans to raise funds for a EUR 80-100bln reinsurance scheme for countries struggling with rocketing jobless claims, the FT reported.</p><p><strong>CHINA: </strong>PBoC adviser Ma Jun advised China to not set a 2020 GDP target given the large uncertainties, while Ma added setting a target may force China to resort to flood-like stimulus and noted that GDP growth of 4%-5% will be difficult to reach. Elsewhere, a Chinese Tax Bureau official said China is monitoring the trade situation and studying tax reduction, as well as other policies to stabilize situation, while the official added China is studying permitting more foreign firms to benefit from preferential policies such as tax cuts.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>CHICAGO PMI: </strong>fell to 47.8 from 49.0, above the expected 40.0, as well as above the top end of estimates at 46.0. Pantheon note that the regional survey was already under significant pressure compared to other regional surveys due to Boeing (BA) being headquartered in Chicago, so the mid-month COVID-19 shutdown had less of a dent. The consultancy believes, however, that the floor is by no means yet in, despite this seemingly positive overshoot.</p><p><strong>CHINESE NBS MANUFACTURING PMI (MAR)</strong> 52.0 vs. exp. 45.0 (prev. 35.7). Non-Manufacturing PMI (Mar) 52.3 vs. exp. 42.0 (prev. 29.6). Chinese Composite PMI (Mar) 53.0 (prev. 28.9). China Stats Bureau said the rebound does not mean the economy has returned to normal and March data alone cannot tell an improving trend.</p><p><strong>EZ HICP</strong> fell by slightly more than the consensus expected due to the energy component (0.8% Y/Y, exp. 0.8%, prev. 1.2%) - and this may also present downside risks in the months ahead. The core rate also undershot expectations (1.0% Y/Y, exp. 1.1%, prev. 1.2%) due to declines in services inflation. Pantheon Macro said it was difficult to see what happens next; the Easter effect was pronounced last year, but should not be huge this year given that the holiday is in the same month as last year. But the key issue might relate to data collection, which makes next month's April data somewhat less reliable.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.39 HIGHER AT USD 20,48/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 0.07 LOWER AT USD 26.35/BBL</strong></p><p><strong>Oil prices found some reprieve from Monday’s heavy selling albeit trended lower into settlement</strong>. The gains were made overnight after another train-wreck session to start the week, before paring strength as US participants arrived on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco has reportedly sent notice to oil service companies to be prepared to support increasing domestic oil output to 12mln BPD from April 1st and for the foreseeable future; has also requested companies to gain resources (workforce and equipment) to increase capacity to 13mln BPD. Note that sources reported on Tuesday that OPEC members failed to unanimously agree on an emergency meeting of its economic commission board – an indication of the current level of disagreement and lack of cooperation in the group currently. Following on from Russian President Putin’s and US President Trump’s phone call on Monday, where the two reportedly agreed for the need of ministerial level meetings on the oil market, on a similar vein, the Kremlin said on Tuesday that the two also agreed there should be consultations on the oil market. Elsewhere, it was later reported by sources that the Saudi – US alliance has been put on hold for now, following reports in recent weeks that the two nations were looking to find a solution to balance the oil market after the former entered a price war with Russia. Participants now look ahead to the weekly US energy inventories, with the private data release due later on Tuesday, current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +4.0mln, gasoline +1.9mln and distillates +1.0mln, while Cushing stocks have been indicated to be in excess of +4.0mln.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-22.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX was little changed on Tuesday, excluding the long end, which was weaker by settlement. The Fed remains the main buyer in town across the curve, and similar to Monday, its completion of purchases in the belly earlier on in the session saw yields rise off their lows heading into settlement, although by no means drastically, as desks note a supply drought as gauged by lower take-up in the Fed’s Treasury purchases on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Fed’s RRP operation continued to balloon while the regular repo ops saw miniscule take-up. The IG slate continues to let it rip, albeit less pronounced than Monday (IFR noted March as the largest volume month ever with USD 256.47bln in supply), while Israel came to the SSA market (10s, 30s, 100s). By settlement, yields were relatively unchanged, if not higher at the long end, 2s +1bps at 0.238%, 10s +3bps at 0.702%, 30s +7.5bps at 1.359%.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.51% at 2587, NDX -0.96% at 7814, DJIA -1.84% at 21,917.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Utilities -4.02%, Real Estate -3.26%, Financials -2.99%, Cons Stpl -1.96%, Technology -1.89%, Cons Disc -1.78%, Materials -1.43%, Industrials -1.27%, Communication Svs -0.51%, Health -0.39%, Energy +1.63%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Energy stocks (XOP, XLE) were the best performing sector after being offered heavily on Monday, alongside a reprieve in oil prices. Conagra Brands (CAG) was an outperformer after it said it would exceed tis FY guidance. Domino’s (DPZ) was offered after a poor preliminary Q1 SSS growth update. Dollar Tree (DLTR) traded lower as it pulled guidance, citing uncertainties. Airlines (UAL, AAL, DAL) had a strong day as the group moves closer to securing the latest government stimulus package.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>DXY: </strong>The index and Greenback in general seem to have run out of steam after the former topped out fractions ahead of the 100.000 level at 99.954 on a continuation of portfolio rebalancing. Indeed, the Buck failed to glean additional impetus from less COVID-19 contagion than anticipated in the Chicago PMI or US consumer confidence holding up considerably better than feared, even though there may be worse to come when the full nCoV or more damage is done. However, as witnessed on previous occasions (no less than 6 before today in March alone) Fed measures to ease credit and funding strains have undermined the Usd to the benefit of trading partners.</p><p><strong>GBP </strong>Notwithstanding the Dollar’s ongoing and overriding bid, the Pound appears primed to end the last day of the month, quarter and financial year with a flourish as Cable reclaims the 1.2400 handle and Eur/Gbp reverses towards 0.8800 from around 0.8968 to build on Monday’s gains through a key Fib retracement level just under 0.8900. Nothing standout in terms of positive or supportive Sterling factors, but cross flows for the end of March/Q1/fy 2019-20 may be impacting alongside the latest Fed repo facility to provide Usd liquidity, though the FIMA is designed for all foreign Central Banks and international monetary institutions to tap and is in addition to already expanded and enhanced swap lines. Moreover, Eur/Gbp bounced into the 4pm fix and trade remains whippy across the board in currencies (another other asset classes for that matter), with Cable heading back down below the round number around the same time.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD: </strong>The other relative G10 outperformers, or at least deriving more than others from the aforementioned US Dollar pull-back, with the Yen back above 108.00 and Loonie paring losses from nearly 1.4350.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/AUD/EUR: </strong>The major laggards as the Kiwi faces stiff Aud/Nzd headwinds due to its Antipodean neighbour hanging on to a bit more of its post-Chinese PMI relief, but both well down overnight peaks. Conversely, the Franc never really got any purchase from better than expected Swiss retail sales data and remains close to 0.9650, while the Euro has not been able to reclaim 1.1000 after benign Eurozone CPI and still rising coronavirus cases/fatalities in both Spain and Italy especially.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX:</strong> Supported by higher oil prices, RUB, NOK firmed. The US and Russia agreed on Monday to hold ministerial-level talks on stabilising the oil market, and there has been further chatter out of Texas, where regulators are more loudly talking about curbing supply.</p><p><strong>BRL:</strong> Real under-performance in recent days has been attributed to a divide among lawmakers, with Bolsonaro calling for \"no more quarantine\" -- other health officials disagree with that approach. Some data points, like monthly jobs, has also been shelved. However, late Monday, the Brazilians passed measures to support incomes of its poorest citizens and will give monthly payments of BRL 600 for three-months, which could cost almost BRL 50bln.</p>",

Meanwhile, the Fed’s RRP operation continued to balloon while the regular repo ops saw miniscule take-up. The IG slate continues to let it rip, albeit less pronounced than Monday (IFR noted March as the largest volume month ever with USD 256.47bln in supply), while Israel came to the SSA market (10s, 30s, 100s). By settlement, yields were relatively unchanged, if not higher at the long end, 2s +1bps at 0.238%, 10s +3bps at 0.702%, 30s +7.5bps at 1.359%.</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco has reportedly sent notice to oil service companies to be prepared to support increasing domestic oil output to 12mln BPD from April 1st and for the foreseeable future; has also requested companies to gain resources (workforce and equipment) to increase capacity to 13mln BPD. Note that sources reported on Tuesday that OPEC members failed to unanimously agree on an emergency meeting of its economic commission board – an indication of the current level of disagreement and lack of cooperation in the group currently. Following on from Russian President Putin’s and US President Trump’s phone call on Monday, where the two reportedly agreed for the need of ministerial level meetings on the oil market, on a similar vein, the Kremlin said on Tuesday that the two also agreed there should be consultations on the oil market. Elsewhere, it was later reported by sources that the Saudi – US alliance has been put on hold for now, following reports in recent weeks that the two nations were looking to find a solution to balance the oil market after the former entered a price war with Russia. Participants now look ahead to the weekly US energy inventories, with the private data release due later on Tuesday, current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +4.0mln, gasoline +1.9mln and distillates +1.0mln, while Cushing stocks have been indicated to be in excess of +4.0mln.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the Dollar’s ongoing and overriding bid, the Pound appears primed to end the last day of the month, quarter and financial year with a flourish as Cable reclaims the 1.2400 handle and Eur/Gbp reverses towards 0.8800 from around 0.8968 to build on Monday’s gains through a key Fib retracement level just under 0.8900. Nothing standout in terms of positive or supportive Sterling factors, but cross flows for the end of March/Q1/fy 2019-20 may be impacting alongside the latest Fed repo facility to provide Usd liquidity, though the FIMA is designed for all foreign Central Banks and international monetary institutions to tap and is in addition to already expanded and enhanced swap lines. Moreover, Eur/Gbp bounced into the 4pm fix and trade remains whippy across the board in currencies (another other asset classes for that matter), with Cable heading back down below the round number around the same time.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and Greenback in general seem to have run out of steam after the former topped out fractions ahead of the 100.000 level at 99.954 on a continuation of portfolio rebalancing. Indeed, the Buck failed to glean additional impetus from less COVID-19 contagion than anticipated in the Chicago PMI or US consumer confidence holding up considerably better than feared, even though there may be worse to come when the full nCoV or more damage is done. However, as witnessed on previous occasions (no less than 6 before today in March alone) Fed measures to ease credit and funding strains have undermined the Usd to the benefit of trading partners.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown has been on the front foot for the most part as firmer crude prices coupled with the Norges Bank preannouncing bigger daily purchases for next month helped the Nok rally against the grain and rebound from almost 11.6700 to 11.4250 vs the Eur, but its Swedish peer has caught up as Eur/Sek retreats through 11.0000 from just over 11.1200 at one stage, partly on Euro weakness independently.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>The other relative G10 outperformers, or at least deriving more than others from the aforementioned US Dollar pull-back, with the Yen back above 108.00 and Loonie paring losses from nearly 1.4350 by almost 200 pips.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/AUD/EUR</strong></p><p>The major laggards as the Kiwi faces stiff Aud/Nzd headwinds due to its Antipodean neighbour hanging on to a bit more of its post-Chinese PMI relief, but both well down overnight peaks. Conversely, the Franc never really got any purchase from better than expected Swiss retail sales data and remains close to 0.9650, while the Euro has not been able to reclaim 1.1000 after benign Eurozone CPI and still rising coronavirus cases/fatalities in both Spain and Italy especially.</p>",

Futures were supported overnight after Chinese PMI data staged a rebound, although analysts point out that the manufacturing new export orders sub-index remained sub-50, highlighting the challenges from falling overseas demand. April's report will be key to see how it captures the deterioration in the rest of the world. Futures have seen a bounce this morning on news that the Fed was to offer foreign central banks repo operations; some desks have said the implications are limited for equities given the number of monetary measures announced in March (seventh liquidity facility announced this month).</li><li><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy names are higher on reports that the US and Russia are to hold ministerial-level discussions to stabilise the oil market. All other major sectors are negative with utilities and staples leading the losses.</li><li><strong>US STOCKS NEWS: </strong>Airlines are mixed/higher (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV, JBLU, ALK, SAVE), after the Treasury released guidelines on how it will provide grants and loans. JNJ is higher after it signed a deal with Moderna to produce large quantities of coronavirus vaccines. AAPL higher after supplier Japan Display reportedly raises USD 200mln of funding from Apple via customer purchase agreements, sources say. Gap (GPS) is lower after it said it expects stores to remain shut for longer. AMZN, GOOG, FB are lower, reportedly seeking a six-month deferment of Indian digital tax, sources say. CAG higher after its earnings report saw the co. raise 2020 guidance. In energy, PXD and PE are up after formally asking Texas regulators to consider curbing oil output. CCL is heavily lower after it suspended dividend payments and share repurchases, and also expects a net loss in FY20. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>MONTH-END:</strong> Many analysts attributed Monday's rally to month-end rebalancing; Citi notes that turnover was relatively low, and that relative sectors within the broader S&amp;P 500 are sending concerning signals: cyclicals have started to underperform defensive sectors, and Citi notes that over the past year, this has preceded market corrections. The bank also observes that the most COVID-impacted sectors have also begun to underperform the broader index, which has been a tactical leading indicator in recent months; Citi says it is sceptical that risk assets continue to rally once month-end is out of the way.</li><li><strong>FED QE: </strong>Some desks have argued that the Fed being in the market has also provided a source of support for the risk complex. As such, it is worth keeping the NY Fed's daily <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/ny-fed-market-operations-schedule-for-31st-march-2020-first-operation-at-0930-et-1430-bst-31-03-2020\">schedule of purchases to hand</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>LIQUIDITY: </strong>Nomura quants say investors are backing away from overblown pessimism following global central bank actions. Ahead, Nomura says one of two things are likely: either global stock markets experience a double dip in the course of their realignment with reality, or they become more liquidity-driven with an unusually heavy dependence on the actions of central banks. More immediately, Nomura warns that liquidity in equity futures markets has been slow to recover, and this lack of liquidity means that futures markets are likely to remain volatile, with implications for the stability of trends in cash equity prices as well. \"The effect may be temporary, but it appears that equity futures are being priced at a discount in markets where liquidity is relatively lacking while being priced at a premium in markets where liquidity is still relatively plentiful, perhaps partly as a result of how the coronavirus outbreak has shaken up market-making activity.\" &nbsp;</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asia equity markets were mostly higher (before trimming some gains) as the region took its cue from the gains on Wall St following recent global stimulus efforts</strong> and with sentiment also underpinned by an improvement in the latest Chinese PMI figures. <strong>ASX 200 (-2%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.9%)</strong> were lifted from the open with early outperformance in Australia led by the largest weighted financials sector and with sentiment also boosted after yesterday’s record AUD 130bln stimulus announcement, while Japanese exporters initially benefitted from a weaker currency, although both indices then gave up the gains amid Q1-end rebalancing and amid some doubts regarding the Chinese data. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.3%) </strong>and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%)</strong> conformed to the early constructive tone following encouraging Chinese PMI data in which headline Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and the Composite PMI also printed in expansion territory. However, gains in the mainland were somewhat limited as some downplayed the data given that it was a recovery from the prior month’s record low base and with China’s stats bureau warning the rebound does not mean the economy has returned to normal and that this month’s data alone cannot determine an improving trend. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured in a continuation of the pullback from the 153.00 level, with demand subdued by the early upbeat tone in risky assets and following weaker results at the 2yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-Day Reverse Repos at a rate of 2.20% vs. Prev. 2.20% (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.0851 vs. Exp. 7.0860 (Prev. 7.0447)</strong></p><p><strong>Chinese NBS Manufacturing PMI (Mar) 52.0 vs. Exp. 45.0 (Prev. 35.7).

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities trade on a firmer footing once again (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) </strong>as sentiment remains upbeat alongside quarter-end rebalancing flows and post-Chinese PMI metrics, albeit stocks have drifted off highs. On the data front, price garnered some support from the last survey data out of China in which headline Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and the Composite PMI also printed in expansion territory. However, it is worth noting that some desks have downplayed the data given that it was a recovery from the prior month’s record low base and with China’s stats bureau warning the rebound does not mean the economy has returned to normal and that this month’s data alone cannot determine an improving trend. In terms of sector specifics, energy names sit near the top of the pile in a bounce-back from some of the declines yesterday with WTI now back above USD 21/bbl and Shell (+4.0%) shares shrugging off expectations of a USD 400-800mln Q1 impairment charge and weak refining margins. Elsewhere, travel and leisure names have also seen support during today’s session as hopes continue to be pinned on government support measures, albeit, from a UK standpoint, Times’ Swinford noted comments from Transport Secretary Shapps that the “UK government is attempting to find the right solution for airlines”, something which Swinford inferred as meaning that it “doesn’t sound like a big bailout is coming”. The main theme in the pre-market was largely centered around the suspension of buybacks and dividends (details of which can be found in the European equity opening news) with particular focus on the UK banking sector with the latest reports via Sky News suggesting that the Prudential Regulation Authority will, on Tuesday or Wednesday, state that Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS will not be paying dividends as part of FY results. Notable individual movers include Imperial Brands (+12.4%) after signing a new revolving credit facility of EUR 3.5bln and noting no material impact on group performance, Bayer (+2.0%) has reached a settlement with US plaintiffs and WPP (+6.9%) are firmer despite suspending its buyback, dividend and outlook, whilst noting that it maintains a strong balance sheet.</p><p><strong>Tesla (TSLA) -</strong> Credit Suisse revises Tesla Q1 delivery forecast to around 75-80k units vs. Prev. 94k units</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Buck has extended gains vs major counterparts, albeit to varying degrees as a sharp rebound in Chinese PMIs, some consolidation in crude and remaining asset rebalancing flows for the final trading session of March, Q1 and the current financial year help some rival currencies to resist the Greenback’s advances. However, the DXY looks more assured around 99.500 and certainly back on the 99.000 handle within a 99.694-99.100 range, and could continue its recovery towards resistance at 99.915 (prior 2020 high before the psychological 100.000 mark was breached precisely one month later on March 20 when the index hit 102.999).</p><p><strong>NOK - </strong>The G10 outlier and outperformer, partly due to the aforementioned bounce in oil prices, but mainly as the Norges Bank plans to jack up foreign currency sales against the Norwegian Krona to the equivalent of Nok2 bn per day in April from Nok1.6 bn this month and only a quarter of the new daily total in February. Eur/Nok is hovering just above 11.5100, but has been under 11.5000 in contrast to Eur/Sek flat-lining between 11.1040-0610 parameters.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD/GBP/EUR/JPY/CHF - </strong>Firmer or more stable crude is also providing the Loonie with some underlying support around 1.4200 vs its US peer, while the Aussie and Kiwi are both holding off overnight pre-Chinese PMI flash crash lows of 0.6080 and 0.5948, though down from best levels reached (0.6200+ and 0.6037 respectively) when the headline prints exceeded consensus and regained 50+ growth rather than deep contraction levels. Elsewhere, the Pound has lost its grasp of 1.2400, but faring better against the Euro circa 0.8900 as the single currency retreats through 1.1000 vs the Buck on soft Eurozone inflation and the ongoing nCoV spread in Spain. Note, hefty Eur/Usd option expiries do not seem likely to impact at this stage, but for the record there are several ranging from 1 to 1.6 bn rolling off from 1.1000 to the 1.1100 strike and beyond. Meanwhile, the Yen and Franc are towards the bottom of 108.70-107.75 and 0.9649-0.9581 bands and hindered by safe-haven outflows, with the latter not deriving any support from considerably firmer than forecast Swiss retail sales.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Some respite for the Rouble after a call between US President Trump and his Russian counterpart Putin aimed at stopping the dispute with Saudi Arabia over the price of oil and market share, but little joy for the Lira even though the CBRT has rolled out more liquidity provisions for Turkish banks.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> are gradually paring more of their early DMO issuance related losses and unwinding losses relative to core counterparts at fresh Liffe intraday highs of 136.47 (-22 ticks vs -139 ticks at one stage), as the FTSE drifts back from best levels alongside EU equivalents awaiting the return of <strong>US market participants</strong> for the run in to month end. However, bonds are still on the back foot amidst the last asset portfolio and balance sheet adjustments for the final trading day of Q1 and some potential market moving macro releases in the form of Chicago PMI and Conference Board consumer confidence.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front-month futures experience consolidation from the prior session’s hefty losses, in which prices tumbled to their lowest points in almost 20 years. The former outperforms on the prospect of potential US-Russia cooperation in the energy markets to stem the rotting prices. US President Trump conducted a phone call with his Russian counterpart yesterday with Kremlin noting that this was at the request of the US. The leaders agreed on the need for stability in the energy markets, albeit no further details were released. WTI front-month contracts have reclaimed USD 21/bbl to the upside having yesterday printed a base at around USD 19.30/bbl, whilst Brent touched a multi-year low at ~ USD 21.60/bbl, with prices now nearer to USD 23.50/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> trades subdued amid a firmer USD and with portfolio rebalancing also in the fray. The yellow metal hovers just above the 1600/oz mark having hit an overnight peak at USD 1626/oz. Meanwhile,<strong> copper </strong>prices remain supported by the strong China NBS manufacturing PMIs which rose back into expansionary territory from last month’s detrimental print. Copper gains a firmer footing above USD 2/lb ahead of resistance at 2.5/lb from a technical standpoint.</p><p>OPEC March crude production survey: JCB sees OPEC crude output rising by 170k BPD to 27.92mln BPD - increases led by Saudi raising production by 370k BPD to 10.15mln BPD.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equities trade on a firmer footing once again (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) as sentiment remains upbeat alongside quarter-end rebalancing flows and post-Chinese PMI metrics, albeit stocks have drifted off highs. On the data front, price garnered some support from the last survey data out of China in which headline Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and the Composite PMI also printed in expansion territory. However, it is worth noting that some desks have downplayed the data given that it was a recovery from the prior month’s record low base and with China’s stats bureau warning the rebound does not mean the economy has returned to normal and that this month’s data alone cannot determine an improving trend. In terms of sector specifics, energy names sit near the top of the pile in a bounce-back from some of the declines yesterday with WTI now back above USD 21/bbl and Shell (+4.0%) shares shrugging off expectations of a USD 400-800mln Q1 impairment charge and weak refining margins. Elsewhere, travel and leisure names have also seen support during today’s session as hopes continue to be pinned on government support measures, albeit, from a UK standpoint, Times’ Swinford noted comments from Transport Secretary Shapps that the “UK government is attempting to find the right solution for airlines”, something which Swinford inferred as meaning that it “doesn’t sound like a big bailout is coming”. The main theme in the pre-market was largely centered around the suspension of buybacks and dividends (details of which can be found in the European equity opening news) with particular focus on the UK banking sector with the latest reports via Sky News suggesting that the Prudential Regulation Authority will, on Tuesday or Wednesday, state that Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS will not be paying dividends as part of FY results. Notable individual movers include Imperial Brands (+12.4%) after signing a new revolving credit facility of EUR 3.5bln and noting no material impact on group performance, Bayer (+2.0%) has reached a settlement with US plaintiffs and WPP (+6.9%) are firmer despite suspending its buyback, dividend and outlook, whilst noting that it maintains a strong balance sheet.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Buck has extended gains vs major counterparts, albeit to varying degrees as a sharp rebound in Chinese PMIs, some consolidation in crude and remaining asset rebalancing flows for the final trading session of March, Q1 and the current financial year help some rival currencies to resist the Greenback’s advances. However, the DXY looks more assured around 99.500 and certainly back on the 99.000 handle within a 99.694-99.100 range, and could continue its recovery towards resistance at 99.915 (prior 2020 high before the psychological 100.000 mark was breached precisely one month later on March 20 when the index hit 102.999).</p><p><strong>NOK </strong>- The G10 outlier and outperformer, partly due to the aforementioned bounce in oil prices, but mainly as the Norges Bank plans to jack up foreign currency sales against the Norwegian Krona to the equivalent of Nok2 bn per day in April from Nok1.6 bn this month and only a quarter of the new daily total in February. Eur/Nok is hovering just above 11.5100, but has been under 11.5000 in contrast to Eur/Sek flat-lining between 11.1040-0610 parameters.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD/GBP/EUR/JPY/CHF</strong> - Firmer or more stable crude is also providing the Loonie with some underlying support around 1.4200 vs its US peer, while the Aussie and Kiwi are both holding off overnight pre-Chinese PMI flash crash lows of 0.6080 and 0.5948, though down from best levels reached (0.6200+ and 0.6037 respectively) when the headline prints exceeded consensus and regained 50+ growth rather than deep contraction levels. Elsewhere, the Pound has lost its grasp of 1.2400, but faring better against the Euro circa 0.8900 as the single currency retreats through 1.1000 vs the Buck on soft Eurozone inflation and the ongoing nCoV spread in Spain. Note, hefty Eur/Usd option expiries do not seem likely to impact at this stage, but for the record there are several ranging from 1 to 1.6 bn rolling off from 1.1000 to the 1.1100 strike and beyond. Meanwhile, the Yen and Franc are towards the bottom of 108.70-107.75 and 0.9649-0.9581 bands and hindered by safe-haven outflows, with the latter not deriving any support from considerably firmer than forecast Swiss retail sales.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Some respite for the Rouble after a call between US President Trump and his Russian counterpart Putin aimed at stopping the dispute with Saudi Arabia over the price of oil and market share, but little joy for the Lira even though the CBRT has rolled out more liquidity provisions for Turkish banks</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> are gradually paring more of their early DMO issuance related losses and unwinding losses relative to core counterparts at fresh Liffe intraday highs of 136.47 (-22 ticks vs -139 ticks at one stage), as the FTSE drifts back from best levels alongside EU equivalents awaiting the return of US market participants for the run in to month end. However, <strong>bonds</strong> are still on the back foot amidst the last asset portfolio and balance sheet adjustments for the final trading day of Q1 and some potential market moving macro releases in the form of Chicago PMI and Conference Board consumer confidence.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures experience consolidation from the prior session’s hefty losses, in which prices tumbled to their lowest points in almost 20 years. The former outperforms on the prospect of potential US-Russia cooperation in the energy markets to stem the rotting prices. US President Trump conducted a phone call with his Russian counterpart yesterday with Kremlin noting that this was at the request of the US. The leaders agreed on the need for stability in the energy markets, albeit no further details were released. <strong>WTI</strong> front-month contracts have reclaimed USD 21/bbl to the upside having yesterday printed a base at around USD 19.30/bbl, whilst <strong>Brent</strong> touched a multi-year low at ~ USD 21.60/bbl, with prices now nearer to USD 23.50/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> trades subdued amid a firmer USD and with portfolio rebalancing also in the fray. The yellow metal hovers just above the 1600/oz mark having hit an overnight peak at USD 1626/oz. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices remain supported by the strong China NBS manufacturing PMIs which rose back into expansionary territory from last month’s detrimental print. <strong>Copper</strong> gains a firmer footing above USD 2/lb ahead of resistance at 2.5/lb from a technical standpoint.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck has extended gains vs major counterparts, albeit to varying degrees as a sharp rebound in Chinese PMIs, some consolidation in crude and remaining asset rebalancing flows for the final trading session of March, Q1 and the current financial year help some rival currencies to resist the Greenback’s advances. However, the <strong>DXY </strong>looks more assured around 99.500 and certainly back on the 99.000 handle within a 99.694-99.100 range, and could continue its recovery towards resistance at 99.915 (prior 2020 high before the psychological 100.000 mark was breached precisely one month later on March 20 when the index hit 102.999).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>The G10 outlier and outperformer, partly due to the aforementioned bounce in oil prices, but mainly as the Norges Bank plans to jack up foreign currency sales against the Norwegian Krona to the equivalent of Nok2 bn per day in April from Nok1.6 bn this month and only a quarter of the new daily total in February. Eur/Nok is hovering just above 11.5100, but has been under 11.5000 in contrast to Eur/Sek flat-lining between 11.1040-0610 parameters.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD/GBP/EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Firmer or more stable crude is also providing the Loonie with some underlying support around 1.4200 vs its US peer, while the Aussie and Kiwi are both holding off overnight pre-Chinese PMI flash crash lows of 0.6080 and 0.5948, though down from best levels reached (0.6200+ and 0.6037 respectively) when the headline prints exceeded consensus and regained 50+ growth rather than deep contraction levels. Elsewhere, the Pound has lost its grasp of 1.2400, but faring better against the Euro circa 0.8900 as the single currency retreats through 1.1000 vs the Buck on soft Eurozone inflation and the ongoing nCoV spread in Spain. Note, hefty Eur/Usd option expiries do not seem likely to impact at this stage, but for the record there are several ranging from 1 to 1.6 bn rolling off from 1.1000 to the 1.1100 strike and beyond. Meanwhile, the Yen and Franc are towards the bottom of 108.70-107.75 and 0.9649-0.9581 bands and hindered by safe-haven outflows, with the latter not deriving any support from considerably firmer than forecast Swiss retail sales.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some respite for the Rouble after a call between US President Trump and his Russian counterpart Putin aimed at stopping the dispute with Saudi Arabia over the price of oil and market share, but little joy for the Lira even though the CBRT has rolled out more liquidity provisions for Turkish banks.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asia equity markets were mostly higher (before trimming some gains) as the region took its cue from the gains on Wall St following recent global stimulus efforts</strong> and with sentiment also underpinned by an improvement in the latest Chinese PMI figures. <strong>ASX 200 (-2.9%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-1.2%)</strong> were lifted from the open with early outperformance in Australia led by the largest weighted financials sector and with sentiment also boosted after yesterday’s record AUD 130bln stimulus announcement, while Japanese exporters initially benefitted from a weaker currency, although both indices then gave up the gains amid Q1-end rebalancing and amid some doubts regarding the Chinese data. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.5%) </strong>and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%)</strong> conformed to the early constructive tone following encouraging Chinese PMI data in which headline Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and the Composite PMI also printed in expansion territory. However, gains in the mainland were somewhat limited as some downplayed the data given that it was a recovery from the prior month’s record low base and with China’s stats bureau warning the rebound does not mean the economy has returned to normal and that this month’s data alone cannot determine an improving trend. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured in a continuation of the pullback from the 153.00 level, with demand subdued by the early upbeat tone in risky assets and following weaker results at the 2yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-Day Reverse Repos at a rate of 2.20% vs. Prev. 2.20% (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.0851 vs. Exp. 7.0860 (Prev. 7.0447)</strong></p><p><strong>Chinese NBS Manufacturing PMI (Mar) 52.0 vs. Exp. 45.0 (Prev. 35.7).

The T-Note reached its highs not long after the US cash equity open as the Fed continued its ramped-up asset purchases, completing its belly purchases earlier on. However, another deluge of corporate supply to start the week, including Oracle (ORCL) with a USD 20bln 6-parter from the 5-year up to the 40-year maturity, weighed somewhat on duration in the latter part of the session; IFR noted there are at least 12 High Grade primary issuers on Monday for a week that looks set to break records again. Furthermore, the repo operations continue to see minimal demand with the GC rate still trading close to zero, while the reverse repo operation sees continued blockbuster demand, supporting the lack of collateral supply thesis and thus the bull-steepener on Monday. By settlement, 2s -3bps at 0.22%, 10s -6.5bps at 0.68%, 30s -3.5bps 1.30%; front-end bills have risen back into positive territory after moving into negative for the first time ever last week; 3-month USD Libor-OIS remains wide at 136bps. T-note (M0) futures settled 18 ticks higher at 138-26+.</p><p>Fed's Bostic (non-voter) said the Fed is looking to see in the coming weeks whether its existing programmes will prove adequate.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board as the region takes it cue from the gains on Wall St following recent global stimulus efforts and with sentiment also underpinned by an improvement in the latest Chinese PMI figures. ASX 200 (+1.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were lifted from the open with early outperformance in Australia led by the largest weighted financials sector and with sentiment also boosted after yesterday’s record AUD 130bln stimulus announcement, while Japanese exporters benefit from a weaker currency and encouraging data including Industrial Production and Retail Sales. Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) also conform to the constructive tone following encouraging Chinese PMI data in which headline Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates and the Composite PMI also printed in expansion territory. However, gains in the mainland are somewhat limited as some downplayed the data which merely showed a recovery from the prior month’s record low base and with China’s stats bureau warning the rebound does not mean the economy has returned to normal and that this month’s data alone cannot determine an improving trend.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY remains firmer after having reclaimed the 99.00 level to the upside and with the greenback also benefiting from weakness in its transatlantic counterparts as a bout of volatility was seen across the FX majors heading into the key Chinese PMI data, in which EUR/USD fell about 50 pips and GBP/USD slipped around 140 pips in a matter of minutes through the 1.1000 and 1.2300 levels respectively, before paring the majority of the slump shortly after. Elsewhere, USD/JPY reclaimed the 108.00 handle and JPY-crosses are also lifted on the safe-haven outflows, while antipodeans are marginally higher after having reversed the intraday mini flash crash and following better than expected Australian Private Sector Credit, as well as the Chinese PMI releases.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are pressured in a continuation of the pullback from the 153.00 level, with demand subdued by the constructive risk tone and ahead of the 2yr JGB auction later.</p>",
