In terms of earnings, Caterpillar (CAT) sunk on disappointing earnings; the co. beat on revenue expectations but saw orders decline more than the seasonal norm, and EPS was guided to the lower end of the FY outlook range.

Big tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), were under pressure after news broke that the co.’s would be targeted in a new DoJ antitrust probe. AT&amp;T (T) and CBS Corp (CBS) were buoyed by comments from AT&amp;T’s CEO during a conference call, where he noted negotiations with CBS are not “too far apart”. Chevron (CVX) advanced, despite premarket reports that the Trump Administration is split over whether to renew the energy co.’s Venezuela operations license. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) popped higher premarket on overnight news that the two co.’s had agree to sell USD 5 billion worth of wireless assets to Dish Networks (DISH), in a deal brokered by the DoJ that makes the two co.’s proposed merger more likely. Dish shares fell. Tesla (TSLA) shrugged off a negative WSJ article, which noted how its Model 3 sales have taken a hit in California as of late. LVMH (LVMH FP) reported Q2 earnings, with sales and profits both exceeding expectations, particularly in like-for-like sales of leather goods and fashion (+20% Y/Y). Upside was seen in LVMH’s US ADR (LVMUY) and in US competitors, including Tapestry (TPR), Ralph Lauren (RL) and Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF). S&amp;P 500 0.5% at 3020, NASDAQ-100 0.7% at 8011, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.3% at 27270.</p><p>Disappointing European and US Manufacturing PMI data sent EGBs and Treasuries higher through the day. German Manufacturing PMI came in below expectations at 43.1, the lowest since July 2012, which helped set record lows in German yields, and naturally lower yields in Treasuries. The trend continued heading into the US equity open and was supported more by the US Manufacturing PMI print of 50, the lowest since September 2009. However, resistance emerged going into the 5-year auction, which tailed by 1bps and B/C ratio of 2.26x (six-auction average of 2.39x), indirects took the lowest share since December 2015 and dealers took their largest share since December 2018. At settlement the curve had flattened, with the 2s10s narrowing by 1.6bps, the 30-year yield had fallen by just under 4bps points and the 2-year yield by about 1.5bps. US T-note futures finished electronic trade higher by 6 ticks at 127.17+.</p>",

Treasuries and other government bonds found support after multi-year lows were recorded in US and German Manufacturing PMIs in June, which also saw bidding in safe haven FX pairs with the data playing nicely into rationale for Fed and ECB rate cuts. In the backdrop, Boris Johnson stepped into position as the UK’s new PM and replaced the majority of the existing cabinet. The crude complex failed to hold onto gains from the 11mln barrel reported draw in US crude stocks; sellers emerged before the energy settlement after Saudi Arabia and Kuwait announced plans to restart oil production in their neutral zone.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin comments that next week's meeting in China will be followed up by talks in Washington, combined with reports suggesting that the talks in China are being held in Shanghai to allow President XI to join the discussions, set a constructive tone. Elsewhere, Japan told the WTO that export controls to South Korea are based on National Security and are not an embargo. This was later followed by an announcement from the South Korean Deputy minister who stated his Japanese counterpart has rejected requests for a face to face meeting to discuss the trade row.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>* US MARKIT FLASH PMI (JULY): </strong>The<strong> </strong>US Markit Manufacturing PMI showed the lowest reading since September 2009, falling to 50 from 51.5 previously and missing expectations of 51. The report stated lower production volumes, which albeit only fell slightly, and was the largest decline since August 2009, paving the way for a negative reading along with a fall in employment and reduced stocks of purchases. The survey also noted that a downturn in the automotive sector and global economic uncertainty were factors behind the loss of momentum. BMO note that despite the positive readings from the Empire survey and Philly fed index, the chance of a manufacturing recession remains omnipresent. Services PMI printed an increase to 52.2 (prev. 51.5), the strongest rise in the service sector output in three months. However, Markit notes that the expansion was only modest and much softer than what was observed in Q1.&nbsp; Markit state the growth of business activity was supported by July price discounting, as average charges were reduced the most since February 2016. Markit’s Comp figure came in slightly higher than previous at 51.6 (prev. 51.5), remaining above three-year lows in May, highlighting that private sector growth only signalled a “modest expansion”. Markit note inflationary pressures remained subdued and costs only rose slightly, with service providers reporting price discounting in July.</p><p><strong>* EZ MARKIT FLASH PMIs (JULY): </strong>The EU Markit Manufacturing Flash PMI came in at 46.4, below expectations for 47.6 and last month’s 47.6. Meanwhile, EU Services PMI was 53.3, inline while the comp figure came in at 51.5 (a three-month low). “The manufacturing sector has become an increasing cause for concern… (with) the survey indicative of the goods-producing sector contracting at a quarterly rate of approximately 1%”, IHS Markit say. In reference to the inflation component, they add “inflationary pressures became increasingly subdued… (registering) the smallest increase since November 2016). The<strong> </strong>German Markit Manufacturing Flash PMI came in at 43.1, below expectations for 45.2 and the previous reading of 45.0; “manufacturing output fell sharply in July, registering its steepest drop since March and one of the most marked contractions since 2009” said IHS Markit. The services number came in at 55.4, slightly above expectations for 55.3, but below the prior 55.8, while the composite number came in at 51.4. French Markit Manufacturing Flash PMI came in at 50.0, below expectations for 51.6 and last month’s 51.9 reading, services was 52.2, below expectations for 52.6, and comp. came in at 51.7. ING note that if the ECB is still undecided about whether to act tomorrow or in September, “this PMI has given the doves on the governing council even more ammunition.”</p><p><strong>* ECB PREVIEW: </strong>62 of 67 analysts surveyed by Reuters look for the Deposit Rate to be held at - 0.4%, with four looking for a 10bps cut, and one looking for a 20bps cut; Main Refi and Marginal Lending rates are unanimously expected to remain unchanged at 0% and 0.25% respectively. Note, markets currently price in 53.4% chance of a cut this week. With the ECB expected to stand pat on rates this week, participants will be eyeing any tweaks to the Bank’s forward guidance that would pave the way for a potential move in September, possibly as part of a broader easing package. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22366/download\">Click here for the full report</a>.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iranian President Rouhani said that Iran was ready for “just, legal and honest negotiations”, alluding to the US, but caveating that not if negotiations mean surrender. Rouhani said that if the US continues to fly drones in Iran airspace, they will continue to be shot down. Talking about the vessel seizures, he suggested that if the UK were to release the Grace 1 tanker (currently held in Gibraltar), Iran could be interested in releasing the UK owned Stena Impero ship which it seized in the Strait of Hormuz last week; a separate Iranian official said the UK had sent a mediator to secure the release of the Stena Impero, but a UK government source denied the claims. Following the UK-EU efforts for launching a maritime security naval mission in the Strait of Hormuz, an Iranian military official said that any change to the Strait’s status opens the door to dangerous confrontation. Rouhani also said that the reduction of commitments under the 2015 Nuclear Deal can be reversed if the other signatories uphold their commitments (Europe purchasing Iranian crude), warning that a third step reduction in commitments will follow if remaining signatories do not reach a deal.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Boris Johnson officially became UK PM and, as expected, a cabinet reshuffle took place; Sajid Javid took the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dominic Raab took the role of Foreign Secretary after it was announced Jeremy Hunt would not be a part of the new cabinet, turning down a separate role. Steven Barclay remained as Brexit Minister, Pritti Patel took the role of Home Secretary, Michael Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Ben Wallace as Defence Secretary and Liz Truss appointed as Trade secretary.</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES: </strong>rose 7% to 646k, missing expectations of 660k whilst the prior was revised lower to 604k. Pantheon notes that the report is soft, but the monthly figures are very unreliable which often show margin errors as large as 15% either side. Thus, it is better to track the trend in comparison to the mortgage application numbers, which shows sales are running only slightly below the pace set by the mortgage application figures. Pantheon state this suggests new home sales ought to rise over the next few months.</p><p><strong>* CBRT PREVIEW: </strong>All 18 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the Turkish Central Bank to cut rates at the conclusion of its meeting on Thursday. Thus, markets will be focusing on how deep the move will be. The magnitude of the reduction could be between 100bps and 500bps, according to surveys, with the exact size likely to depend on how the Central Bank views the evolution of inflation. However, desks are cognizant of Turkey’s frail economy, and the Lira’s fragile nature amid geopolitical tensions with the US, as well as President Erdogan’s domestic battle with the Central Bank. It’s also worth keeping in mind that a 500bps is not unprecedented, given that the CBRT hiked rates by 625bps in September last year to stem Lira weakness. SocGen notes that the Lira overnight forward implied yield stands around 21.4%, with the 1-month rate at 19.6% which implies a rate cut greater than 180bps but below 440bps, although suggests it is hard to gauge what the Central Bank will do relating to fundamentals, since there are question marks over the credibility of the Central Bank following the abrupt CBRT leadership change. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22372/download\">Click here for the full report</a>.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts are slightly positive about the auction, and say the 7-year sector trades cheap in the curve versus 5s and 10s, and thinks it trades fair in asset swap versus older 5s in terms of relative value. The bank says that the sector could see good demand, noting that the 7-year WI yield currently trades near 1.91%, higher than the June auction stop out rate. SocGen also notes that the May 7-year auction saw good demand from investment funds and foreigners.</p><p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>Disappointing European and US Manufacturing PMI data sent EGBs and Treasuries higher through the day. German Manufacturing PMI came in below expectations at 43.1, the lowest since July 2012, which helped set record lows in German yields, and naturally lower yields in Treasuries. The trend continued heading into the US equity open and was supported more by the US Manufacturing PMI print of 50, the lowest since September 2009. However, resistance emerged going into the 5-year auction, which tailed by 1bps and B/C ratio of 2.26x (six-auction average of 2.39x), indirects took the lowest share since December 2015 and dealers took their largest share since December 2018. At settlement the curve had flattened, with the 2s10s narrowing by 1.6bps, the 30-year yield had fallen by just under 4bps points and the 2-year yield by about 1.5bps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.89 LOWER AT USD 55.88/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.65 LOWER AT USD 63.18/BBL: </strong>The energy complex failed to hold gains from bullish US inventory reports, with losses being extended heading into settlement as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait discussed resuming production in their neutral zone, prior estimates suggested the zone could yield an additional 500k BPD for each country. The DoE’s printed a much larger than expected draw at -10.8mln bbls, similar to the API figure on Tuesday; gasoline stocks had a small draw (-0.2mln) whilst distillates had a small build (+0.6mln); the Cushing, Oklahoma hub drew by -0.5mln bbls. Production dipped lower to 11.3mln bbls from 12.0mln, the lowest in almost a year. Whilst refinery utilization printed a surprise decrease of -1.3%; however, with the recorded period for the week’s data starting at the tail-end of the Tropical Storm Barry, the report is bound to be influence to some distortion due to the supply disruptions throughout the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.5% at 3020, NASDAQ-100 0.7% at 8011, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.3% at 27270, SECTORS; </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary 0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples -0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Energy 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Financials 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care 0%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Materials 0%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities 0.1%.</p><p><strong>* US EARNINGS: </strong>Caterpillar (CAT) sunk on disappointing earnings; the co. beat on revenue expectations but saw orders decline more than the seasonal norm, and EPS was guided to the lower end of the FY outlook range. Boeing (BA) was under pressure after reporting earnings that contained the widely expected USD 5.6bln 737 MAX grounding charge, with desks citing concerns over possible 777 delays due to engine issues. Visa (V) struggled to stay in the green, despite posting a health beat on the bottom line, reporting strong growth in payments volume and backing guidance. United Parcel Services (UPS) shot higher after beating on the top and bottom lines and announcing plans to begin Sunday pickup and delivery as of next year. Snap Inc (SNAP) shot higher after the co. posted solid gains in daily average users across geographies and devices. Texas Instruments (TXN) moved higher despite guiding revenue lower, with some desks suggesting the adjustments had been not as bad as feared and noted the co. is shipping to Huawei again. Northrop Grumman (NOC) popped higher premarket after beating on the top and bottom line and guiding its FY adj. EPS view higher. Anthem Inc. (ANTM) fell despite beating on the top and bottom lines, with analysts focusing on notably higher Medical Loss Ratio (MLR). Notable other stocks benefiting from strong earnings; AT&amp;T Inc. (T), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Chubb Limited (CB), Discover Financial Services (DFS), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX), Grainger (W.W.) Inc. (GWW), Robert Half International (RHI), Owens Corning (OC). Notable other stocks suffering after soft earnings; Amphenol Corp (APH), FLIR Systems (FLIR), Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC), Rollins Inc. (ROL), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Check Point Software Technologies Ltd (CHKP).</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Big tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), were under pressure after news broke that the co.’s would be targeted in a new DoJ antitrust probe. AT&amp;T (T) and CBS Corp (CBS) were buoyed by comments from AT&amp;T’s CEO during a conference call, where he noted negotiations with CBS are not “too far apart”. Chevron (CVX) advanced, despite premarket reports that the Trump Administration is split over whether to renew the energy co.’s Venezuela operations license. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) popped higher premarket on overnight news that the two co.’s had agree to sell USD 5 billion worth of wireless assets to Dish Networks (DISH), in a deal brokered by the DoJ that makes the two co.’s proposed merger more likely. Dish shares fell. Tesla (TSLA) shrugged off a negative WSJ article, which noted how its Model 3 sales have taken a hit in California as of late. LVMH (LVMH FP) reported Q2 earnings, with sales and profits both exceeding expectations, particularly in like-for-like sales of leather goods and fashion (+20% Y/Y). Upside was seen in LVMH’s US ADR (LVMUY) and in US competitors, including Tapestry (TPR), Ralph Lauren (RL) and Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF).</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Further declines in EZ and US Manufacturing PMIs kept <strong>EURUSD</strong> within a 1.1128-1.1158 range; the data points seemingly strengthening the argument for looser monetary policy on both sides of the pond.

USD 72bln is set to mature at the month-end settlement, net supply is implied ta USD 59bln. TD Securities notes that the Fed portfolio run-off has slowed to USD 15bln per month (versus USD 30bln per month previously); and with USD 21.5bln of the SOMA portfolio maturing at month-end, the Fed will add on USD 2.3bln to 2s, USD 2.3bln to 5s, and USD 1.8bn to 7s.</p><p><strong>* FIVE-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts say the five-year sector lacks clear set up from a relative-value perspective, with current 5s trading cheap in asset swap vs older 5s, and it also trades rich on the curve vs 2s and 10s. That said, SocGen notes that the current 5 trades slightly special in repo, and SocGen says that combined with the relatively low dealer holdings, as well as the fact that the current when-issued yield for the sector is a tad above the last month’s auction stop, will benefit the auction. SocGen says it has a positive bias going into the auction.</p>",

All eyes now on Johnson’s inaugural speech as PM and the official unveiling of the new Cabinet after his Royal appointment, but for now the pro-Brexiteer appears to be getting the market’s benefit of doubt. Conversely, the Aussie has tumbled ahead of a speech from RBA Governor Lowe overnight amidst softer CBA PMI surveys and a more dovish outlook from Westpac that now foresees another 50 bp easing via 2 OCR cuts at the start of Q3 this year and in mid-Q1 next year. Aud/Usd has tested major chart support at the 100 DMA (0.6975-70), but holding in for now.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar rally has been dented if not derailed by preliminary Markit PMIs showing pronounced manufacturing sector weakness in line with other economies, and nudging the index back down towards 97.500. Note, the DXY had been probing through key chart resistance at 96.770, but faded ahead of 98.000 amidst the ongoing Gbp revival noted above and as other currency counterparts pared losses.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>Also major outperformers, and especially the Scandi Crowns that have both rebounded sharply from recent lows vs the Euro on a mixture of technical retracement, EZ PMI weakness and pre-ECB positioning, while a stronger bounce in crude prices fuelled the reversal in Eur/Nok towards 9.6150 as well. Eur/Sek is hovering around 10.5100 and seeking some independent direction from Thursday’s Swedish economic tendency survey before the aforementioned ECB policy meeting. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has derived some traction from a larger than expected NZ trade surplus to consolidate/build gains back over 0.6700 vs its US peer and revisit 1.0400 against the Aussie, while the Yen has pivoted 108.00 and 4 bn+ option expiry interest at the strike with little reaction to BoJ sources suggesting division over whether to implement more stimulus next week or hold fire.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>The Loonie also got a lift from oil to pull back further from 1.3160+ lows, but stalled around 1.3120, while the Franc straddled 0.9850 and 1.1000 vs the Euro that managed to stem EZ PMI declines vs the Buck ahead of the 2019 low and 1.1100 with the aid of the Greenback downturn and perhaps some inertia related to 1 bn option expiries at 1.1150.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Zar and Usd/Try are both hovering closer to the base of 13.9520-13.8635 and 5.7355-5.7010 respective ranges, with the Rand boosted by more ‘one and done’ rate cut inferences from the SARB plus slightly firmer than forecast m/m inflation, while the Lira remains content or relieved that the US is still weighing up sanctions and awaiting tomorrow’s CBRT rate decision to see how low they go.</p>",

Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.8%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.4%)</strong> were higher with broad strength seen in Australia aside from the mining sector, while gains in Tokyo were capped amid a downturn among JPY-crosses. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%)</strong> showed a strong performance on the trade optimism which was also helped by US Commerce Secretary Ross who said he will deal with Huawei waiver applications within the next few weeks, while China was also said to be looking to make more agricultural purchases as a goodwill gesture.

UK’s FTSE 100 (-1.0%) lags its peers amid unfavourable currency action coupled with underperformance in heavyweight mining names following a barrage of broker downgrades. As such, Rio Tinto (-4.0%), BHP (-3.4%) and Anglo American (-3.1%) all rest at the foot of the index. Sectors are mixed with defensive sectors supported due to the current cautious risk tone. In terms of individual movers, ASM (+7.3%), ITV (+6.1%) and Akzo Nobel (+4.1%) shares are all fuelled by earnings and trade at the top of the Stoxx 600. On the flip side, Deutsche Bank (-3.7%) shares plumbed the depths post-earning after the German lender reported a larger than expected net loss and cut its FY 19 revenue guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - Buck bulls have gleaned even more encouragement from unfolding US-China trade developments given that face-to-face talks look set to resume early next week, and Beijing offers to buy more agricultural goods as a good will gesture in response. Moreover, the Dollar continues to proffer from the demise of others and increasingly constructive technical impulses with the DXY eclipsing a Fib retracement level and inching closer towards the psychological 98.000 mark.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - The Aussie has given up 0.7000+ status and is now threatening to slide below 0.6975 in wake of slowdowns in all CBA PMI readings overnight and yet another dovish RBA policy call looking for 2 further cuts in the OCR (Westpac this time eyeing moves in October and February 2020).

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Buck bulls have gleaned even more encouragement from unfolding US-China trade developments given that face-to-face talks look set to resume early next week, and Beijing offers to buy more agricultural goods as a good will gesture in response. Moreover, the Dollar continues to proffer from the demise of others and increasingly constructive technical impulses with the <strong>DXY</strong> eclipsing a Fib retracement level and inching closer towards the psychological 98.000 mark.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie has given up 0.7000+ status and is now threatening to slide below 0.6975 in wake of slowdowns in all CBA PMI readings overnight and yet another dovish RBA policy call looking for 2 further cuts in the OCR (Westpac this time eyeing moves in October and February 2020). All this ahead of comments from RBA Lowe in the early hours on Thursday and in contrast to the Kiwi that is keeping in contact with 0.6700 after a wider than forecast NZ trade balance, albeit due to a bigger miss on the import side vs exports.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD</strong></p><p>The single currency has also been undermined by PMI surveys, and in particular the manufacturing prints showing France on the 50 threshold and Germany sinking deeper into contraction. With Eurozone M3 also softer than expected, rate cut odds have now tipped in favour of 10 bp for tomorrow’s ECB meeting and Eur/Usd is losing sight of decent option expiry interest at 1.1150 (1 bn) as a result, but holding above the ytd base and 1.1100 where big barriers lie. Meanwhile, the Franc has retreated further vs the Buck within a 0.9850-75 band, but remains above 1.1000 against the Euro pending Thursday’s ECB policy pronouncements and the SNB’s response, but the Loonie has clawed back some lost ground vs its US counterpart to meander between 1.3129-47 compared to 1.3164 or so at one stage on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Relative outperformers and bucking the overall trend, as the Pound maintains its recovery momentum following confirmation that Boris Johnson will take over the reins from Theresa May as Tory Party head. Cable has extended its rebound from near 1.2400 to 1.2480+ awaiting the official unveiling of the new PM and his Cabinet line up, with Eur/Gbp down towards 0.8925 and early July mtd lows. Similarly, the Yen is still displaying resilience in the face of overall Usd strength and upbeat risk sentiment despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, with a reluctance to stray too far from 108.00 where massive expiries roll off (4.3 bn) and technical resistance capping the upside (108.31 Fib).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand remains in the spotlight amidst comments from SARB Governor Kganyago underlining post-rate cut guidance for limited additional monetary stimulus and CPI data that was slightly firmer than anticipated in m/m terms. Usd/Zar is hovering just below 13.9500 as the Central Bank head highlights the fact that neutral rates have risen due to risk premia of late and this makes it tougher for further easing.</p>",

Gilts have now effectively matched near term resistance at 132.29 vs the July 4 contract high (132.45) and the 3 month strip is flat to 1.5 ticks ahead vs -2 ticks at one stage, while Bunds have sharply extended their contract high to 174.51 amidst widespread gains. The pan EZ release may not spark much more reaction and M3 also seems unlikely to rock the boat, while the only domestic data due is mortgage applications, so any material commentary emanating from the EU meeting to discuss Brexit in wake of Boris Johnson’s victory may be more pertinent for Gilts, Short Sterling and the Pound today.</p>",

Indeed, yesterday’s Eurex peak was 173.97 vs 174.05 at best on Independence Day and the near miss may leave the core Eurozone bond idling ahead of a busy midweek session and the penultimate piece of the macro jigsaw before Thursday’s ECB policy pronouncements in the form of preliminary PMIs (with Ifo completing the picture tomorrow). Note, however, the pull-back in Bunds has been relatively shallow again with losses only extending to 17 ticks so far, at 173.78, and futures now edging back up towards the early 173.88 apex. From a technical perspective, 173.56 represents near term support and was Tuesday’s intraday low.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was steady above 108.00 as it remained propped up by a firmer greenback although <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses suffered from base currency weakness, while antipodeans were lacklustre in which <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> underperformed and broke down support at the 0.7000 level after softer Australian PMI data and with Westpac calling for 2 more rate cuts from the RBA in October and February.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Australian CBA Manufacturing PMI (Jul P) 51.4 (Prev. 52.0).</strong> (Newswires) Australian CBA Services PMI (Jul P) 51.9 (Prev. 52.6) Australian CBA Composite PMI (Jul P) 51.8 (Prev. 52.5)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Zealand Trade Balance (Jun) M/M 365M vs. Exp. 100M (Prev. 264M)</strong> New Zealand Exports (Jun) 5.01B vs. Exp. 5.29B (Prev. 5.81B) New Zealand Imports (Jun) 4.65B vs. Exp. 5.20B (Prev. 5.54B)&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were relatively flat overnight as <strong>WTI</strong> took a breather from the prior day’s gains where the geopolitical risk premium was once again in play after the UK approached EU nations to join a naval mission to secure passage through the Strait of Hormuz and amid reports the US may have downed more than one Iranian drone. In addition, a larger than expected drawdown in headline API crude stockpiles briefly added further fuel to the upside for oil, although the immediate jolt was quickly faded due to bearish components of the release including a surprise build in gasoline inventories. Price action in <strong>gold</strong> was restricted by the firm greenback and lack of safe-haven demand, while <strong>copper</strong> traded sideways and failed to benefit from risk appetite as it eyed a test of support at USD 2.70/lb and amid a 3rd consecutive decline in Dalian iron ore futures which slipped over 4% by the break.</p><p><strong>API Weekly Crude Inventories (23 July) -10.96mln vs. Exp. -4.0mln (Prev. -1.4mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>US may have downed more than one Iranian drone, according to Centcom Commander General Kenneth McKenzie.

Treasuries came under pressure going into the US equity open as equity futures pressed higher, with analysts also highlighting the large amount of corporate issuance in the day’s pipeline contributing to the selling. However, bidding was supported shortly after with gratitude to a disappointing US June existing home sales print alongside a multi-year low reading in the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index. Selling resumed going into the 2-year auction, which recorded its first tail (0.2bps) in 2019 on a B/C ratio of 2.5x (prev. 2.8x); primary dealers also took an increased share of 31.6%, more-or-less in line with its 5-auction average. The T-Note fell to fresh lows later as it was announced USTR Lighthizer would be heading to China on Monday for face-to-face meetings with Chinese officials. At settlement, spreads across the curve were little changed with the 10-year yield up by approximately 2.5bps.

This underpinned the major indices on Wall St. with outperformance seen in the trade sensitive sectors such as materials and industrials, although futures pared some of the gains after-market on news the DoJ is to open a broad antitrust review on the large tech firms. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were higher with broad strength seen in Australia aside from the mining sector, while gains in Tokyo were capped amid a downturn among JPY-crosses. Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) outperformed on the trade optimism which was also helped by US Commerce Secretary Ross who said he will deal with Huawei waiver applications within the next few weeks, while China was also said to be looking to make more agricultural purchases as a goodwill gesture. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with demand sapped following similar uninspiring trade in USTs amid the positive risk tone and with the BoJ also absent from the market today.</p>",
