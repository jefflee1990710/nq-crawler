The rest of the FAANGs (FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX) opened lower in sympathy with Google and extended losses throughout the session. Mastercard (MA) moved higher after the payments provider reported earnings that beat bottom line expectations. Western Digital (WDC) initially fell after the technology co missed top and bottom-line earnings expectations, recouping losses later in the session. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) jumped higher, despite missing EPS expectations, as the chipmaker provided encouraging guidance for H2 19. Eli Lilly (LLY) opened lower after the pharma co. reported a miss on revenue expectations, despite beating on profit. AbbVie (ABBV) moved lower with the market, despite one of the pharma co’s headline drugs being approved by the European Commission. Merck (MRK) shares rose after the firm reported earnings that beat bottom-line expectations, with revenue coming largely in line. Likewise, competitor Pfizer (PFE) rose as the pharma co also beat on bottom line expectations and raised its EPS guidance for FY19. HCA Healthcare (HCA) opened higher after beating bottom line expectations. General Electric (GE) jumped higher after the utility co. released earnings that beat bottom line expectations and positive CEO comments. General Motors (GM) fell after the automaker missed top line expectations. Chevron (CVX) opened higher on the news that Anadarko (APC), for whom Chevron had made a bid worth USD 65 per share, consider a bid from rival energy co Occidental (OXY) superior. Occidental traded lower, shrugging off news that Warren Buffet was to invest USD 10bln in Occidental to help fund the Anadarko bid. MGM Resorts’ (MGM) share price was hit after the hospitality co. reported earnings that missed on both top and bottom-line expectations. Consumer Staples, including Archer Midland Daniel’s (ADM), Colgate Palmolive (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), P&amp;G (PG) and Coca Cola (KO) performed well, rising throughout the session, despite the wider stock market falling, with desks citing possible end of month squaring. SPX +0.1% at 2945, NDX -0.7% at 7781, DJI +0.2% at 26593.</p><p>The complex was ticking lower after overnight Chinese PMI data remained in expansion (not a spectacular print, but continues to point to stabilisation), and then EZ growth surprising to the upside slightly saw the complex find lows. However, the trend soon reversed, the complex moving higher after Chicago PMI missed the forecast range, which doesn't augur particularly well for the upcoming ISM reports (even though the data may have been influenced heavily by Boeing's woes) and the 2 and 3 year yields reached fresh 1-month lows. Some desks also suggested month-end factors were playing a role in the Treasury action. US T-note futures (M9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 123-21+</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities mixed/down, dollar down, Treasuries up, crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>EZ Q1 GDP small beat, Germany CPI higher than expected,<strong> </strong>Chicago PMI misses, Pending Home Sales higher, Trump and Dems discuss USD 2trln infrastructure plan.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>US FOMC/Powell, Mfg ISM (Apr), Markit Mfg PMI (Apr/F), ADP (Apr), construction spending (Mar), CA Markit Mfg PMI (Apr), JP Apr/F Mfg PMI, UK consumer finance (Mar), Mfg PMI (Apr), SK trade balance (Apr), CPI (Apr), ECB De Guindos</p><p><strong>* WEDNESDAY’S EARNINGS: </strong>QCOM, ADP, CVS, EL, YUM, RCL</p><p><strong>* INFRASTRUCTURE: </strong>US House Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer, after a 90-minute meeting in the White House, said that US President Trump had agreed to a USD 2trln infrastructure investment plan, calling the meeting ‘very constructive’. They cautioned that they had not agreed how to pay for the package, but had decided to meet in three weeks to discuss. The comments helped the risk complex stabilise.</p><p><strong>* US CONUMER CONFIDENCE:</strong> 129.2 beat the expected 126.0, and the prior was revised up by 0.1 points to 124.2; the differential between jobs 'plentiful' and 'hard to get' rose to 33.5 from 28.3. A rebound in the current conditions and expectations components helped drive the data, though still short of levels seen in March. \"Still, with the stock market hitting new highs over the past month and labour demand still very strong, we expect a further recovery in confidence over the next couple of months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"even if the index just remains at its April level, though, confidence is still very high and consistent with much stronger spending than in Q1.\"</p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES:</strong> Pending home sales continues to see upside as yields fell in Q1; the three-month annualised rate is now running at a clip of 32%, which analysts say is not sustainable in the long run, but could continue to see upside over the coming months as new homes sales normalises. Pantheon said, \"The index remains well below the level implied by the lagged mortgage applications numbers, but it is headed in the right direction and it signals a rebound in existing home sales in April.\"</p><p><strong>* US CHICAGO PMI:</strong> The Chicago PMI missed expectations, and was below the forecast range, introducing some downside risks to the upcoming ISM data. The data may have been influenced by Boeing specifically (HQ is in Chicago), given other regional surveys are more upbeat.</p><p><strong>* US EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX:</strong> Rose by 0.7% Q/Q in Q1, in line with the consensus. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the key components, wages and benefits, both rose 0.7%, \"though note that the 1.0% jump in benefits for government employees was double the increase in the private sector,\" the consultancy says, \"Private sector wages rose 0.7%, matching the Q4 increase, but an unfavourable base effect meant that the Y/Y rate dipped a tenth to 3.0%.\" Pantheon also notes that private wages appear to have been hit bit a dip in the volatile incentive pay component, and Pantheon estimates that wage ex-incentive pay rose 0.8%. \"The ECI measure of private sector wage growth is running a bit lower than the average hourly earnings numbers, but the broad trends are similar,\" Pantheon says, \"wages are accelerating, but not very rapidly, and the current Y/Y growth rates are not inflationary unless productivity growth drops back well below 1%, which is unlikely.\" Over the course of this year, however, Pantheon is expecting wage growth to rise substantially, given the tight and still tightening labour market.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>The punitive tariffs which the US and China initially placed on each other’s goods are now the major obstacle in the resolution of trade talks, reported the WSJ citing officials, with the US pushing to leave some of the tariffs in place as a means of enforcing the coming agreement. White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney went on to say that the US would only do a deal with China if it is a good deal for the US and that trade talks are likely to be resolved ‘one way or another’ within the next fortnight. US Agriculture Secretary Perdue weighed in, saying he doesn’t want it implied that ‘a deal is done’ but remains cautiously optimistic that a deal will be done.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Ahead of the FOMC Meeting tomorrow, Trump reiterated his opposition to recent rate hikes, saying ‘the Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates, even though inflation is very low, and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening.’ He also praised China for keeping rates low and adding stimulus to its economy, while saying that he believed the US economy could 'go up like a rocket' if the Fed were to reduce rates by 1 point.</p><p>* <strong>FOMC PREVIEW:</strong> FOMC to leave rates unchanged on 1 May (decision due 1900 BST/1400 EDT, ahead of the press conference with Chair Powell at 1930 BST/1430 EDT); The Fed will not publish new economic projections at this meeting (SEP next released in June). The market will be watching whether the Fed outlines conditions that might compel the Committee to discuss lowering rates. There are some risks that the Fed might tweak its statement to reflect stronger growth and softer inflation since the last meeting. There is also a possibility the Fed could lower its IOER rate. The Committee’s tone is likely to remain one of patience and data dependence.

Regarding the economy, he said the Canadian economy continues to face some headwinds but there are good reasons to believe it will accelerate in 2H19. On the central banks level of accommodation, he said that the accommodation rate is still warranted, and the bank will continue to evaluate level of accommodation as new data is released. Finally, he said that household debt levels had stabilised and, he hoped, had now peaked while mortgage quality is improving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Labour Party, in their anticipated meeting today, announced that they have agreed to support a 2nd Brexit referendum if unable secure a general election or if the government will not change their policy. This news followed earlier confirmation on the Conservative side, from PM May’s de facto Deputy Lidington and a government spokesman, that the recent cross-party talks had been productive. The Editor of Politics Home also reported, citing Downing Street sources, that cross party talks need to conclude by the middle of next week.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 0.41 HIGHER AT USD 63.91/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD 0.76 HIGHER AT USD 72.80/BBL</strong>. Crude trades higher, but is off the highs as markets settle, with the June Brent contract expiring today. The monthly Reuters survey sees oil output dipping by 90k BPD from March to 30.23mln BPD, which would be the lowest since 2015; analysts expect to see compliance fall from 145% to 132%, with Iran and Venezuela posting the largest declines, while Nigeria, Libya, Iraq and Saudi are seen raising production. Comments from the Saudi energy minister also gave the market support; Al Falih said he was eager to see OPEC+ agreement extended into the second half of the year, and there was no need to exceed the production limits. Citi notes that Saudi cuts to 9.8mln bpd put it about 0.5mln bpd below its 10.311mln bpd voluntary target, and so Saudi Arabia could technically boost production immediately without breaking its commitment. However, the run of commentary since US announced it would pull Iran waivers has not leaned to any immediate ramping up of production. Some reports yesterday noted that the Saudi fiscal breakeven price for oil was around USD 85/bbl, hinting that the nation would continue to support higher oil prices so long as they are not contributing to a destruction of demand. After the bell, API data is expected to show Crude +1.5mln, Cushing +0.183mln, distillates -0.2mln, gasoline -1.0mln.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2945, NDX -0.7% at 7781, DJI +0.2% at 26593. SECTORS: Communications -0.4%, Cons Discretionary -0.2%, Cons Staples +1.2%, Energy +0.0%, Financials +0.2%, Healthcare +0.5%, Industrials +0.5%, Materials +0.9%, Tech +0.2%, Telecoms -2.5%, Utilities +1.7%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares fell substantially after the tech co reported earnings that missed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line and then faced a number of broker downgrades, including from Morgan Stanley who lowered their price target for the co. The rest of the FAANGs (FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX) opened lower in sympathy with Google and extended losses throughout the session. Mastercard (MA) moved higher after the payments provider reported earnings that beat bottom line expectations. Western Digital (WDC) initially fell after the technology co missed top and bottom-line earnings expectations, recouping losses later in the session. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) jumped higher, despite missing EPS expectations, as the chipmaker provided encouraging guidance for H2 19. Eli Lilly (LLY) opened lower after the pharma co. reported a miss on revenue expectations, despite beating on profit. AbbVie (ABBV) moved lower with the market, despite one of the pharma co’s headline drugs being approved by the European Commission. Merck (MRK) shares rose after the firm reported earnings that beat bottom-line expectations, with revenue coming largely in line. Likewise, competitor Pfizer (PFE) rose as the pharma co also beat on bottom line expectations and raised its EPS guidance for FY19. HCA Healthcare (HCA) opened higher after beating bottom line expectations. General Electric (GE) jumped higher after the utility co. released earnings that beat bottom line expectations and positive CEO comments. General Motors (GM) fell after the automaker missed top line expectations. Chevron (CVX) opened higher on the news that Anadarko (APC), for whom Chevron had made a bid worth USD 65 per share, consider a bid from rival energy co Occidental (OXY) superior. Occidental traded lower, shrugging off news that Warren Buffet was to invest USD 10bln in Occidental to help fund the Anadarko bid. MGM Resorts’ (MGM) share price was hit after the hospitality co. reported earnings that missed on both top and bottom-line expectations. Consumer Staples, including Archer Midland Daniel’s (ADM), Colgate Palmolive (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), P&amp;G (PG) and Coca Cola (KO) performed well, rising throughout the session, despite the wider stock market falling, with desks citing possible end of month squaring.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 123-21+.</strong> The complex was ticking lower after overnight Chinese PMI data remained in expansion (not a spectacular print, but continues to point to stabilisation), and then EZ growth surprising to the upside slightly saw the complex find lows. However the trend soon reversed, the complex moving higher after Chicago PMI missed the forecast range, which doesn't augur particularly well for the upcoming ISM reports (even though the data may have been influenced heavily by Boeing's woes) and the 2 and 3 year yields reached fresh 1-month lows. Some desks also suggested month-end factors were playing a role in the Treasury action.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> weakened amid EUR strength and an increase in Bund yields on the back of better than expected European data. With weak Chicago PMI data doing little to help, the DXY fell as low as 97.44 on the day. <strong>EUR</strong> strengthened on after EZ Q1 GDP and German CPI both came in above expectations and Italian growth returned to positive territory, driving EURUSD back above the 1.1200. <strong>GBP</strong> strengthened in tandem the EUR, while also seeing upside on reports that the opposition Labour Party had opted to back a second Brexit referendum if it cannot secure a general election or come to an agreement with the government. GBPUSD broke back above the 1.3000 handle, consolidating around 1.3050. <strong>YEN,</strong> after strengthening against its major counterparts during the Asia-Pac session after soft Chinese PMI data, lost ground vs EUR and GBP after strong EZ economic data. It did, however, hold on to gains vs USD, amid dollar weakness and US equities trading lower. <strong>CAD</strong> strengthened throughout the day, buoyed by crude prices, the dollar weakening and comments from BOC Governor Poloz, who suggested that the recent decision to trim the bank’s estimate of the neutral rate is not permanent and the neutral rate estimate could be revised higher again. <strong>AUD, NZD</strong>: Antipodeans weakened throughout the day, with losses initially triggered by underwhelming Chinese PMI data, but both traded relatively flat vs USD. <strong>TRY</strong> continued to perform poorly amid the overhang of a number of risks; which include a diplomatic spat with the US over S-400 Russian missiles whose delivery to Turkey could result in calls for US sanctions and the possibility of a rerun of mayoral elections in Istanbul. Moreover, concern remains regarding the relationship between the Erdogan administration and the CBRT; who, in their minutes published today, defended the recent decision to leave rates unchanged despite rising inflation expectations. <strong>MXN</strong> weakened after the Q1 GDP release showed a surprise 0.2% Q/Q contraction in the Mexican economy in Q1, missing market expectations of a 0.3% Q/Q expansion.</p>",

Apple and Qualcomm (WCOM) reached a settlement to agree to drop all litigation, and reached a global patent license agreement and a chipset supply agreement (to the detriment of Intel (INTC)). Qualcomm’s chips are better positioned to allow Apple to focus on 5G networks, which raises the possibility Apple releases a 5G iPhone sooner than the market had anticipated, and using Qualcomm’s tech. However, the settlement might impact margins: GS explains that while Apple was previously accruing for what they believed they should have been paying Qualcomm for royalties, a higher payment per device may have been agreed to by Apple in order to achieve the settlement, and as these actual payments begin, GS says it would not be surprised to see some negative margin impact for Apple, though adds that the degree of impact, if any, is difficult to estimate. Current guidance estimates are for USD 52.1bln in Q3, FY EPS seen at USD 11.36, FY revenue seen at USD 255.4bln.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Source: RANsquawk, Refinitiv.</strong></i></p><p><strong>NOTE: RANsquawk is trialling this new format for US earnings previews and would welcome your feedback.

Comments from the Saudi energ minister also gave the market support; Al Falih said he was eager to see OPEC+ agreement extended into the second half of the year, and there was no need to exceed the production limits. Citi notes that Saudi cuts to 9.8mln bpd put it about 0.5mln bpd below its 10.311mln bpd voluntary target, and so Saudi Arabia could technically boost production immediately without breaking its commitment. However, the run of commentary since US announced it would pull Iran waivers has not leaned to any immediate ramping up of production. Some reports yesterday noted that the Saudi fiscal breakeven price for oil was around USD 85/bbl, hinting that the nation would continue to support higher oil prices so long as they are not contributing to a destruction of demand. After the bell, API data is expected to show Crude +1.5mln, Cushing +0.183mln, distillates -0.2mln, gasoline -1.0mln.</p>",

Month end model rebalancing, and a strong Usd sell signal vs the Gbp from one institution seemed to be a major factor, but the Pound also forged gains against a data supported Euro lending some credence to the notion that reports of progress and some product between the Conservatives and Labour over Brexit also impacted. Note, Eur/Gbp slipped from 0.8650+ at one stage to just shy of 0.8600 with talk of Frankfurt fix flows also in the mix.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the single currency derived support from Eurozone data (for a change) as German state CPIs pointed to an above consensus national number and the latter duly beat expectations with a 2% y/y print. Moreover, pan Eurozone GDP also eclipsed forecasts in line with data from Spain and Italy as the latter emerged from recession, while unemployment dipped again in March to lift Eur/Usd further beyond 1.1200, through a 50% Fib at 1.1217 and only a whisker off the 21DMA (1.1233).</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The Yen also benefited from the aforementioned overall Dollar weakness, but also latest Chinese PMIs revealing renewed weakness in manufacturing especially. Usd/Jpy finally breached 111.50 and strong chart support at 111.37 (convergence of earlier April low, Fib and DMA) to briefly trade under 111.25.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed or effectively unchanged vs the Greenback as the Kiwi holds within range and around 0.6665 ahead of Q1 NZ labour data, while the Loonie pared losses in wake of contractionary Canadian GDP from 1.3480 towards 1.3450 awaiting comments from BoC’s Poloz and Wilkins, and the Franc meandered between 1.0200-1.0175.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has been choppy and mostly underperforming from 0.7069 highs to 0.7034 lows in wake of those disappointing Chinese PMIs and now looking AIG’s manufacturing survey to see whether there is knock-on weakness and/or whether more encouraging new orders filter through.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Aside bearish end of April positioning, the Buck succumbed to more post-PCE inflation data selling and lost more ground on the back of a much weaker than anticipated Chicago PI, with the index now probing below 97.500 and closer to technical levels protecting last week’s 97.258 base.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira only derived some traction from the CBRT inflation report and policy meeting minutes that played down the removal of guidance for more rate hikes to ensure inflation returns to target, as Usd/Try remains near the upper end of a 5.9835-9335 range.</p>",

On the flip side, the energy sector is faring well amidst price action in the oil complex which aided BP (+0.4%), Shell (+0.2%) and Total (+0.1%) climb back into positive territory. Back to earnings, Standard Chartered (+5.7%) extended on opening gains after optimistic earnings coupled with a USD 1.0bln share buyback programme which is expected to reduce its CET1 ratio by around 35bps in Q2. Elsewhere, DSV (+6.8%), Beiersdorf (+2.3%), MTU Aero Engines (+2.2%), and Caixabank (-3.9%) are amongst the movers post-earnings. Finally, Danske Bank (-8.2%) shares fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after FT reported that Brussels vows to pursue a probe into the bank’s money laundering scandal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>USD - The Dollar is softer across the board after Monday’s soft PCE inflation data and with rebalancing models for the last trading day of April flagging sells signals to varying degrees. Hence, the DXY has slipped back from 98.000+ levels again, and this time the index is probing somewhat deeper blow chart supports that were tested towards the end of last week, but not breached. If 97.544 (50% Fib) and 97.500 fail to hold, 97.460 is next on the radar before a stronger downside target and low from last week looms at 97.258.</p><p>GBP - The Pound is the best G10 performer and biggest beneficiary of month end Greenback weakness with one bank signalling especially strong Cable buying to balance portfolios. Subsequently, the pair has extended recovery gains from the low 1.2900 area to circa 1.2986 and through several DMAs including the 10, 100 and 200 levels (at 1.2940 and 1.2961 coincidentally).</p><p>EUR/JPY - Vying for 2nd place in the major ranks and both impacted by data, albeit diversely, as the single currency draws encouragement from firmer than forecast Eurozone GDP and inflation to reclaim the 1.1200 handle. However, the Jpy has now overcome strong resistance at 111.37 to peer above 111.30 in wake of disappointing Chinese PMIs overnight that spurred some risk-aversion and demand for the safe-haven Yen.</p><p>NZD/CHF/CAD - The next best G10s or gainers due to the more pronounced Usd downturn, with the Kiwi hovering near the top of a 0.6681-56 range and Franc back over 1.0200 within 1.0199-75 trading parameters, while the Loonie is pivoting 1.3350 ahead of Canadian data in the form of monthly GDP and PPI. Note also, BoC Governor Poloz and Wilkins are slated to speak later, and then NZ Q1 jobs and labour costs for Q1 are on tap before attention turns to Wednesday’s FOMC.</p><p>AUD - The Aussie is lagging on the aforementioned PMI misses from China and in particular the official and Caixin manufacturing reads that only just avoided stagnation. Aud/Usd is straddling 0.7050, as the Aud/Nzd cross slips a bit further below recent peaks of 1.0600+ towards 1.0565.</p><p>EM - The Try has been volatile again with further weakness vs the Usd in the run up and during the early part of the CBRT’s inflation presentation, but a partial recovery within a 5.9335-9835 band ultimately as Governor Cetinkaya clarified last week’s post-policy meet statement and guidance to maintain that tightening is still an option if upside inflation risks materialise.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>It’s been gradual or measured, but Bunds continue to take the lead and trade lower as Eurozone growth and inflation updates top expectations, including Italian GDP that returned from recession in Q1. The 10 year German benchmark has just declined to 164.96 and through a few more technical supports for a 59 tick loss on the day, with Gilts dragged down in sympathy to 127.19 (-48 ticks) and even hitherto resilient/detached US Treasuries unable to fully withstand the increasing bearish pressure and whittling gains to just a couple of ticks at best</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Energy markets are trending higher, albeit remain relatively choppy in early EU trade following comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih who (in-fitting with reports) said that the Kingdom is ready to meet shortfalls caused by the expiry of Iranian oil waivers on May 2nd.&nbsp; However, with the upcoming JMMC meeting on May 19th (ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on June 26th) the Saudi Energy Minister also noted that a majority of the cartel’s oil ministers are tilting towards extending the global output deal. Analysts at BNP highlight that there is a “good chance” that OPEC countries and allies will decide to extent the supply curb deal in June, although some changes may be made to the current deal. The energy minister also noted that the nation’s oil output will be significantly lower than 10mln BPD (last recorded around 9.8mln BPD) until May-end, whilst exports will be below 7mln BPD (currently just under 7mln BPD). Meanwhile, IFX reported that Russia’s April oil output stood at 11.23mln BPD, slightly lower than March’s 11.3mln. This, coupled with a receding Dollar aided WTI and Brent futures to climb comfortably above USD 64.00/bbl and USD 72.50/bbl respectively. Elsewhere, precious metals are also benefitting from the weaker Greenback with spot Gold meandering just below its 100 and 200 DMAs at 1293.11 and 1297.40 respectively. Meanwhile, turning to base metals, downside seen from disappointing China Manufacturing data has been offset by the softer Dollar with copper now closer to intraday highs and just a whisker away from its 50 DMA at 2.9054.</p><p>Iran's President states that Iran will continue with oil exports in spite of US pressure.

On the flip side, the energy sector is faring well amidst price action in the oil complex which aided BP (+0.4%), Shell (+0.2%) and Total (+0.1%) climb back into positive territory. Back to earnings, Standard Chartered (+5.7%) extended on opening gains after optimistic earnings coupled with a USD 1.0bln share buyback programme which is expected to reduce its CET1 ratio by around 35bps in Q2. Elsewhere, DSV (+6.8%), Beiersdorf (+2.3%), MTU Aero Engines (+2.2%), and Caixabank (-3.9%) are amongst the movers post-earnings. Finally, Danske Bank (-8.2%) shares fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after FT reported that Brussels vows to pursue a probe into the bank’s money laundering scandal.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar is softer across the board after Monday’s soft PCE inflation data and with rebalancing models for the last trading day of April flagging sells signals to varying degrees. Hence, the DXY has slipped back from 98.000+ levels again, and this time the index is probing somewhat deeper blow chart supports that were tested towards the end of last week, but not breached. If 97.544 (50% Fib) and 97.500 fail to hold, 97.460 is next on the radar before a stronger downside target and low from last week looms at 97.258.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - The Pound is the best G10 performer and biggest beneficiary of month end Greenback weakness with one bank signalling especially strong Cable buying to balance portfolios. Subsequently, the pair has extended recovery gains from the low 1.2900 area to circa 1.2986 and through several DMAs including the 10, 100 and 200 levels (at 1.2940 and 1.2961 coincidentally).</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong> - Vying for 2nd place in the major ranks and both impacted by data, albeit diversely, as the single currency draws encouragement from firmer than forecast Eurozone GDP and inflation to reclaim the 1.1200 handle. However, the Jpy has now overcome strong resistance at 111.37 to peer above 111.30 in wake of disappointing Chinese PMIs overnight that spurred some risk-aversion and demand for the safe-haven Yen.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/CAD -</strong> The next best G10s or gainers due to the more pronounced Usd downturn, with the Kiwi hovering near the top of a 0.6681-56 range and Franc back over 1.0200 within 1.0199-75 trading parameters, while the Loonie is pivoting 1.3350 ahead of Canadian data in the form of monthly GDP and PPI. Note also, BoC Governor Poloz and Wilkins are slated to speak later, and then NZ Q1 jobs and labour costs for Q1 are on tap before attention turns to Wednesday’s FOMC.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong> - The Aussie is lagging on the aforementioned PMI misses from China and in particular the official and Caixin manufacturing reads that only just avoided stagnation. Aud/Usd is straddling 0.7050, as the Aud/Nzd cross slips a bit further below recent peaks of 1.0600+ towards 1.0565.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Try has been volatile again with further weakness vs the Usd in the run up and during the early part of the CBRT’s inflation presentation, but a partial recovery within a 5.9335-9835 band ultimately as Governor Cetinkaya clarified last week’s post-policy meet statement and guidance to maintain that tightening is still an option if upside inflation risks materialise.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s been gradual or measured, but <strong>Bunds</strong> continue to take the lead and trade lower as Eurozone growth and inflation updates top expectations, including Italian GDP that returned from recession in Q1. The 10 year German benchmark has just declined to 164.96 and through a few more technical supports for a 59 tick loss on the day, with Gilts dragged down in sympathy to 127.19 (-48 ticks) and even hitherto resilient/detached <strong>US Treasuries</strong> unable to fully withstand the increasing bearish pressure and whittling gains to just a couple of ticks at best.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Energy markets are trending higher, albeit remain relatively choppy in early EU trade following comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih who (in-fitting with reports) said that the Kingdom is ready to meet shortfalls caused by the expiry of Iranian oil waivers on May 2nd.&nbsp; However, with the upcoming JMMC meeting on May 19th (ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on June 26th) the Saudi Energy Minister also noted that a majority of the cartel’s oil ministers are tilting towards extending the global output deal. Analysts at BNP highlight that there is a “good chance” that OPEC countries and allies will decide to extent the supply curb deal in June, although some changes may be made to the current deal. The energy minister also noted that the nation’s oil output will be significantly lower than 10mln BPD (last recorded around 9.8mln BPD) until May-end, whilst exports will be below 7mln BPD (currently just under 7mln BPD). Meanwhile, IFX reported that Russia’s April oil output stood at 11.23mln BPD, slightly lower than March’s 11.3mln. This, coupled with a receding Dollar aided <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures to climb comfortably above USD 64.00/bbl and USD 72.50/bbl respectively. Elsewhere, precious metals are also benefitting from the weaker Greenback with spot <strong>Gold</strong> meandering just below its 100 and 200 DMAs at 1293.11 and 1297.40 respectively. Meanwhile, turning to base metals, downside seen from disappointing China Manufacturing data has been offset by the softer Dollar with copper now closer to intraday highs and just a whisker away from its 50 DMA at 2.9054.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is softer across the board after Monday’s soft PCE inflation data and with rebalancing models for the last trading day of April flagging sells signals to varying degrees. Hence, the <strong>DXY</strong> has slipped back from 98.000+ levels again, and this time the index is probing somewhat deeper blow chart supports that were tested towards the end of last week, but not breached. If 97.544 (50% Fib) and 97.500 fail to hold, 97.460 is next on the radar before a stronger downside target and low from last week looms at 97.258.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound is the best G10 performer and biggest beneficiary of month end Greenback weakness with one bank signalling especially strong Cable buying to balance portfolios. Subsequently, the pair has extended recovery gains from the low 1.2900 area to circa 1.2986 and through several DMAs including the 10, 100 and 200 levels (at 1.2940 and 1.2961 coincidentally).</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>Vying for 2nd place in the major ranks and both impacted by data, albeit diversely, as the single currency draws encouragement from firmer than forecast Eurozone GDP and inflation to reclaim the 1.1200 handle. However, the Jpy has now overcome strong resistance at 111.37 to peer above 111.30 in wake of disappointing Chinese PMIs overnight that spurred some risk-aversion and demand for the safe-haven Yen.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/CAD</strong></p><p>The next best G10s or gainers due to the more pronounced Usd downturn, with the Kiwi hovering near the top of a 0.6681-56 range and Franc back over 1.0200 within 1.0199-75 trading parameters, while the Loonie is pivoting 1.3350 ahead of Canadian data in the form of monthly GDP and PPI. Note also, BoC Governor Poloz and Wilkins are slated to speak later, and then NZ Q1 jobs and labour costs for Q1 are on tap before attention turns to Wednesday’s FOMC.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The Aussie is lagging on the aforementioned PMI misses from China and in particular the official and Caixin manufacturing reads that only just avoided stagnation. Aud/Usd is straddling 0.7050, as the Aud/Nzd cross slips a bit further below recent peaks of 1.0600+ towards 1.0565.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Try has been volatile again with further weakness vs the Usd in the run up and during the early part of the CBRT’s inflation presentation, but a partial recovery within a 5.9335-9835 band ultimately as Governor Cetinkaya clarified last week’s post-policy meet statement and guidance to maintain that tightening is still an option if upside inflation risks materialise.</p>",

Indeed, Gilts gapped down 12 ticks on their return to Liffe and dipped to 127.54 as Bunds filled a downside chart gap around 165.43 in wake of firm German inflation data from Saxony (trend subsequently continued by others). However, core debt futures rebounded or pared losses with the UK contract briefly up to 127.72 vs 127.67 at Monday’s close against the backdrop of more bullish US Treasuries and a flatter curve before reversing again alongside their Eurozone peer to fresh lows of 127.41 and 165.35 respectively. Meanwhile, the 3 month strip has relinquished modest early gains to stand 0.5-2.5 ticks below parity.</p>",

This benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts across the pond with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> eyeing the 1.1200 handle in which some also attributed the recent upside to relief from the lack of surprises in the Spanish elections and after Italy avoided a downgrade, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was firmer after having found support around 1.2900 and with the tone in cross-party talks said to have improved. Elsewhere, <strong>antipodeans</strong> staggered following the weak Chinese PMI data which also briefly pressured <strong>CNH</strong>, although <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> has since moved off session lows and there were also comments from notorious RBA watcher Terry McCrann that a rate cut next week is possible but remains most unlikely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities have been rangebound so far this week in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures consolidated above USD 63.00/bbl level ahead of the latest inventory reports and key risk events, while Citi have suggested that market could experience some book squaring as June Brent, May heating oil, and May RBOB gasoline futures all expire today.

While the M/M Personal Spending data came in ahead of expectations, the PCE components - the Fed's preferred gauge - disappointed and has softened for the third straight month going into Wednesday's FOMC. Meanwhile, the US Treasury has cut its borrowing estimate for Q2, and now expects to issue USD 30bln in net marketable debt in Q2 (prev. estimate was USD 83bln), and also says it expects to issue 160bln in net marketable debt in Q3. It borrowed USD 374bln in Q1. Overnight China PMIs will be looked at for further stabilisation out of the world's second largest economy, while EZ Q1 advanced data will be the focus in early trade.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower following the release of weaker than expected Chinese PMI data and as the region digests a heavy slate of earnings. ASX 200 (-0.5%) is negative with commodity names leading the declines seen across a broad range of sectors due to its high exposure to China and the disappointing factory activity, while KOSPI (-1.0%) is pressured amid losses in index heavyweight Samsung Electronics after the Co.’s final Q1 results showed oper. profit fell around 60% Y/Y. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are mixed with Hong Kong dampened after Chinese Official Manufacturing, Non-Manufacturing and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs all fell short of estimates which overshadowed the earnings releases including the profit growth amongst the Big 4 banks, while the mainland remains afloat on month-end and pre-holiday position squaring as well as the increased hopes for more accommodative policy in the aftermath of the weak Chinese data.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued and trickles further away from the 98.00 level after the prior day’s softer than expected Core PCE data which is the Fed’s preferred measure for inflation and therefore lessens the likelihood of a hawkish tone in the upcoming FOMC meeting. This has benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD edging closer towards 1.1200 which some also attributed to relief from the lack of surprises in the Spanish elections and after Italy avoided a downgrade, while GBP/USD is firmer after having found support around 1.2900 and with the tone in cross-party talks said to have improved. Elsewhere, antipodeans staggered following the weak Chinese PMI data which also briefly pressured CNH, although AUD/USD has since moved off session lows and there were also comments from notorious RBA watcher Terry McCrann that a rate cut next week is possible but remains most unlikely.</p>",
