The DoJ are preparing anti-trust investigations into Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and possibly Apple (AAPL), both of whose shares sunk on the news. FTC, who reportedly formed an agreement dividing antitrust jurisdiction with the DoJ, secured the right to investigate both Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) on an anti-trust basis (whose shares also sunk on the news). Boeing (BA) shares were under pressure on the news that the aircraft maker had informed the Federal Aviation Administration that certain 737 MAX and 737NG wing components [leading edge slats] may have been improperly manufactured. Merck (MRK) caught a bid after releasing positive results in its latest KEYTRUDA study, in which 5-year survival rates were significantly higher than in previously treated patients. Amgen (AMGN) jumped higher at the open after news emerged that one of the pharma co.’s new drug had shrunk “undruggable” cancer tumours in half of patients. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) moved lower on worries that the US/Mexico trade spat could affect the Mexican food makers profit margins. FedEx (FDX) was under pressure after China announced over the weekend that they look into the US postal service after Huawei reported it had misdirected packages. Centene (CNC) stock price tumbled after Humana (HUM) dismissed speculation that they were looking to take over the former. Humana jumped higher. Centene (CNC) shares sunk after Humana (HUM) made an unusual SEC filing which dismissed market speculation that Humana was looking to buy Centene. Humana (HUM) moved higher. S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2744, NASDAQ-100 -2.1% at 6978, Dow Jones 0% at 24819.</p><p>Treasuries continued their march higher on Monday. The rally was initiated by disappointing UK and EZ Markit Manufacturing PMI, where the bid in Gilts and Bunds seeped across the pond; it worth highlighting that Bund yields reached their all-time lows as German manufacturing remained in the contractionary zone. Analysts note that the reaching of multi-year lows in several US yields sparked some dealer sales and profit taking, where the 30-year posted 31-month lows. However, a mixed release of the US Markit Manufacturing PMI saw the rally continue in the US session, which was then exacerbated by Fed’s Bullard warranting the idea of a rate cut. At settlement, the curve had bull steepened considerably, where the 2s/30s widened by c. 5.5bps, and the 2-year yield dropped by more than 10bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled 16+ higher ticks at 126-28+.</p>",

He also noted that Mexican officials are to meet with USTR Lighthizer and acting US Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan this week, but the extent concessions to the US are limited by \"dignity\" whilst the Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister commented that the US tariffs on Mexico puts at risk the approval of USMCA. Mexican President Obrador was more conciliatory, saying he wants to continue being a friend of US President Trump and is optimistic that a deal can be reached with the US. US President Trump later said that, as a sign of good faith, Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs across the US/Mexico border. Finally, in the last hour of trade, reports emerged suggesting Mexico is mulling retaliation against the US should tariffs proceed.</p><p><strong>* CHINA WHITE PAPER: </strong>China’s State Council overnight released a White Paper on trade, again hitting back at the US and suggesting they were the party that backtracked on three occasions during trade talks (March 2018, May 2018, May 2019) – up until the most recent ‘backtracking’, the two parties had reached a broad consensus on the majority of trade issues, China claimed. China said the remaining issues could not be resolved since the US was insisting on “mandatory requirements concerning China’s sovereign affairs,” as well as refusing to lift tariffs immediately. The paper insinuated that China has enough firepower to continue fighting the trade war. The paper went on to state that China would continue economic reforms and opening up its economy. The paper was released as Chinese counter-tariffs on around USD 60bln of US goods went into effect over the weekend. There were no details given on any potential meetings between China President Xi and US President Trump at the upcoming G20 meeting on 28-29 June. Net/net, the implications seem to be that neither side is seeking to de-escalate trade tensions for now, and the bar to success for any future meetings seems high.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TARGETS FEDEX: </strong>China's will probe FedEx (FDX) on suspicion of undermining the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese clients, China state news agency Xinhua reported on the weekend, alleging that FedEx failed to deliver packages to designated addresses in China, “seriously damaging the lawful rights and interests of its clients and violating laws and regulations governing the express industry in China.” The news followed claims by Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said parcels intended for it were diverted. The WSJ reported that changes at FedEx (FDX) to comply with US trade restrictions reportedly lead to the misrouting of two packages for Huawei.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Bullard (voter, dovish) said an interest rate cut might be warranted soon due to concerns regarding trade and inflation. Bullard also said that the inversion of yield supports his case for further rates (Bullard has heavily warned in the past that the yield curve is a good predictor of future downturns). The dovish fed voter also said that trade uncertainty meant that the expected slowdown in the US might now be even steeper before later noting during a Q/A session that he expects trade uncertainty to continue for foreseeable future and his recent visit to Hong Kong left him more pessimistic about a trade deal. In the wake of Bullard's comments, SPX saw positive ticks, as did the T-Note, while the USD fell toward new session lows (the reaction was short-lived, as AAPL news broke shortly afterwards, unwinding the Bullard Bounce). Analyst chat about 'insurance rate cuts' has picked up following the dovish comments from Fed's Clarida and Kashkari last week, with Bullard adding fuel to that fire on Monday. Overnight, Fed non-voter Daly toed the median line, noting the strength of the US economy, reiterating a ‘patient’ stance. Fed's Quarles (voter) and Fed's Barkin (non-voter) stayed away from current monetary policy/economic outlook comments.</p><p><strong>* US/AUSTRALIA TRADE: </strong>The Trump administration considered imposing tariffs on imports from Australia last week, but decided against the move amid fierce opposition from military officials and the State Department, according to several people familiar with the discussions, NYT reported. However, US President Trump played down suggestions in NYT regarding tariffs on Australia.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP ECONOMY ADIVOR HASSETT TO LEAVE:</strong> Kevin Hassett is set to leave his role as CEA Chair, Bloomberg reported. Hassett said his decision was not related to Mexico tariffs, and had been in the works for a while.</p><p><strong>* ITALY/EUROPE:</strong> Finance Minister Tria insisted Italy was not seeking confrontation with the EU, remarks that appear at odds with commentary from other members of his party, analysts observed. Tria also said Italy would remain within its 2.4% deficit/GDP target, though analysts remain sceptical. EU Commissioner Moscovici continued to call for dialogue. However, Italy Deputy PM Salvini opted to continue the recent tough talks; saying the jobless rate, not the EU deficit, must dictate whether Italy can raise government spending before adding that when the unemployment rate falls below 5%, Italy will comply with rules. Italy PM Conte, in a scheduled speech, said that EU rules will stay in force until the government can secure changes whilst EU disciplinary action would be very bad for Italy. He said that the coalition leaders need to decide if they continue want to with the government or pursue an election whilst saying that he will do his best to protect Italian interests in EU negotiations.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY COALITION FRAGILE:</strong> Bund yields fell to fresh record lows amid the risk-off, as well as after weekend news that SPD leader Nahles, a junior coalition partner, had stepped-down following a soft performance in the recent European elections. Accordingly, speculation about the collapse of the German government has been rife on Monday, potentially leading to elections. This will depend on whom the SPD replaces Nahles with. However, RBC’s analysts note that while the uncertainty would add to global risks, there is a possibility that it leads to a less fiscally conservative government – for instance, if the Greens were to form part of the government (a weekend poll saw them leading, ahead of Merkel’s CDU).</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITCAL:</strong> US Secretary of State Pompeo said on Monday that the US and Europe should work together to ensure Europe has a secure and diversified energy supply; this comes amidst pressure from Washington for Europe to ensure it doesn’t bypass US interests by importing Iranian crude, where Europe had previously mulled the use of a special purpose vehicle to do so. Elsewhere on the Iran front, China has called for the full implementation of the JCPOA, the nuclear deal that the US wants to abandon in order to renegotiate.</p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>May ISM data was a mixed bag; the downtrend for the headline continues, with a 31-month low of 52.1 (expected 53.0 vs prior 52.8). However, the breakdown was more encouraging: new orders rose by 1 point to 52.7 (welcome news consider the Markit manufacturing PMI, released fifteen minutes before the ISM, saw new orders falling into contraction for the first time since August 2009), ahead of NFP this week, the manufacturing employment sub-component was up (+1.2 points to 53.7), and prices rose to 53.2 from 50 (cons 52.5). \"While both orders and production are expanding steadily, the manufacturing sector has undoubtedly hit a soft patch in Q2 amid the recent increase in tariffs vis-à-vis China and now Mexico,\" Oxford Economics said, \"we do not expect a rapid rebound in activity in the months ahead.\" The consultancy notes that while underlying domestic fundamentals remain strong, they are cooling as fiscal stimulus dissipates. OxEco also notes that \"while global central banks have adopted a much more dovish stance, the international growth landscape still looks fragile,\" and the consultancy now sees the Fed's next move as a rate cut in the early part of 2020.</p><p><strong>* CHINA MANUFACTURING PMI:</strong> The Caixin manufacturing PMI – which tends to be a good read on smaller, private companies – saw a slight upside surprise (unchanged at 50.2, CONSENSUS 50.0); Markit reported that total new work rose at a quicker pace, and was underpinned by a rise in export sales. Production, meanwhile, was steady.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE MANUFATURING PMI:</strong> The headline slipped further into sub-50 territory (47.7 in line with consensus, prev. 47.9; Germany confirmed at 50.6, France confirmed at 44.3; Italy rose but remains sub-50, while Spain is a touch above that neutral line). New orders fell for the eighth consecutive month. A decline in work backlogs and delivery times could hint at more slack in the labour market, and the employment sub-component saw a fall after 56 months of consecutive gains.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 16+ HIGHER TICKS AT 126-28+: </strong>Treasuries continued their march higher on Monday. The rally was initiated by disappointing UK and EZ Markit Manufacturing PMI, where the bid in Gilts and Bunds seeped across the pond; it worth highlighting that Bund yields reached their all-time lows as German manufacturing remained in the contractionary zone. Analysts note that the reaching of multi-year lows in several US yields sparked some dealer sales and profit taking, where the 30-year posted 31-month lows. However, a mixed release of the US Markit Manufacturing PMI saw the rally continue in the US session, which was then exacerbated by Fed’s Bullard warranting the idea of a rate cut. At settlement, the curve had bull steepened considerably, where the 2s/30s widened by c. 5.5bps, and the 2-year yield dropped by more than 10bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.25 LOWER AT USD 53.25/BBL; BRENT (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.71 LOWER AT USD 61.28/BBL:</strong> The crude complex traded choppy after paring back earlier gains going into the US session on Monday. Prices were on the backfoot in early trade before catching a bid after Saudi Arabia said it would do what it takes to stabilise the oil market, mentioning the need to for draws in inventories; in addition reports of Saudi’s production currently at 9.65mln BPD. However, the oil market’s growing correlation to equity markets dictated later trade, where US equity markets reversed into the red and crude following suit. Energy analysts at Citi comment, “the larger issue here is that the bullish theme of OPEC+ production restraint and geopolitical risk to supply that lifted prices from January-April are no longer as persuasive.” Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak announced that Russia would be committing to the OPEC+ deal in June (previous reports had suggested the oil major was hesitant, but it’s worth noting this was before the recent harsh sell off in crude). Novak also said that Russia’s combined production cut under the deal stood at 317k BPD beneath the October levels of 11.36mln BPD, above its current quota of 228k BPD; the contamination of oil in the Druzhba pipeline is likely to have forced Russia’s hand somewhat. Sticking to the Druzhba pipeline, following a meeting between Russian energy authorities, Poland's PKN Orlen said clean oil supply to Poland via the pipeline can be re-instated as of June 10th; adding that Russia's Transneft will pay oil producers so they can compensate their customers' losses. Looking ahead to this week's US energy inventory data: crude stocks are seen drawing 0.2mln bbls; both products are seen building, with distillates up by 0.4mln, and gasoline stocks up by 0.7mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2744, NASDAQ-100 -2.1% at 6978, Dow Jones 0% at 24819</strong>; <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary -1.2%, Consumer Staples 1.3%, Energy 1.4%, Financials 0.7%, Health Care 0.3%, Industrials 0.7%, Information Technology -1.8%, Materials 3.2%, Telecommunication Services -2.8%, Utilities 1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Key FAANG names sunk on Monday, as the US government moved to take on big tech. The DoJ are preparing anti-trust investigations into Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and possibly Apple (AAPL), both of whose shares sunk on the news. FTC, who reportedly formed an agreement dividing antitrust jurisdiction with the DoJ, secured the right to investigate both Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) on an anti-trust basis (whose shares also sunk on the news). Boeing (BA) shares were under pressure on the news that the aircraft maker had informed the Federal Aviation Administration that certain 737 MAX and 737NG wing components [leading edge slats] may have been improperly manufactured. Merck (MRK) caught a bid after releasing positive results in its latest KEYTRUDA study, in which 5-year survival rates were significantly higher than in previously treated patients. Amgen (AMGN) jumped higher at the open after news emerged that one of the pharma co.’s new drug had shrunk “undruggable” cancer tumours in half of patients. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) moved lower on worries that the US/Mexico trade spat could affect the Mexican food makers profit margins. FedEx (FDX) was under pressure after China announced over the weekend that they look into the US postal service after Huawei reported it had misdirected packages. Centene (CNC) stock price tumbled after Humana (HUM) dismissed speculation that they were looking to take over the former. Humana jumped higher. Centene (CNC) shares sunk after Humana (HUM) made an unusual SEC filing which dismissed market speculation that Humana was looking to buy Centene. Humana (HUM) moved higher.</p><p><strong>* FX DAILY WRAP: EUR&nbsp;</strong>shrugged off weak manufacturing PMI (which continues to move into contraction territory) and was higher, with Bund/UST yield differentials also favouring the single currency, as well as seasonal effects more supportive (according to SocGen); DXY downside also supported.&nbsp;<strong>DXY</strong>&nbsp;was under pressure as Markit and ISM manufacturing PMI disappointed somewhat, while there is now increasing speculation that the Fed will need to make an insurance rate cut; a dovish Bullard in afternoon trade gave further credence to this notion.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;was unable to benefit from a weaker dollar on the day; as Markit Manufacturing PMI came in well below expectations (and in contractionary territory), and politics continues to be noisy.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;is slightly up amid escalating trade wars,&nbsp;though the 108.00 level has, for now, held.<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>NZD</strong>&nbsp;were buoyed by better than expected Caixin PMI data out of China overnight, as well as the.

        "analysis_details": "<p>The crude complex traded choppy after paring back earlier gains going into the US session on Monday. Prices were on the backfoot in early trade before catching a bid after Saudi Arabia said it would do what it takes to stabilise the oil market, mentioning the need to for draws in inventories; in addition reports of Saudi’s production currently at 9.65mln BPD. However, the oil market’s growing correlation to equity markets dictated later trade, where US equity markets reversed into the red and crude following suit. Energy analysts at Citi comment, “the larger issue here is that the bullish theme of OPEC+ production restraint and geopolitical risk to supply that lifted prices from January-April are no longer as persuasive.” Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak announced that Russia would be committing to the OPEC+ deal in June (previous reports had suggested the oil major was hesitant, but it’s worth noting this was before the recent harsh sell off in crude). Novak also said that Russia’s combined production cut under the deal stood at 317k BPD beneath the October levels of 11.36mln BPD, above its current quota of 228k BPD; the contamination of oil in the Druzhba pipeline is likely to have forced Russia’s hand somewhat. Sticking to the Druzhba pipeline, following a meeting between Russian energy authorities, Poland's PKN Orlen said clean oil supply to Poland via the pipeline can be reinstated as of June 10th; adding that Russia's Transneft will pay oil producers so they can compensate their customers' losses.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>A downbeat start to the week for the USD as the index saw downside throughout the day ahead of the Markit and ISM Manufacturing data in which the former marginally eased and employment rose at the slowest rate since March 2017. Meanwhile, the ISM headline figure missed expectations (52.1 vs. Exp. 53.0) but the components were optimistic with manufacturing employment index and prices paid topping estimates whilst new orders index improved from the prior. DXY was choppy post-data after having fluctuated within a USD 97.50-80 band throughout the day. Looking ahead, tomorrow sees the release of US Durables (R), whilst on the speaker front, Fed voters Evans, Williams, Brainard and Chair Powell are on the docket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The antipodeans remain the G10 outperformers amid a continuation from the optimistic Caixin manufacturing data coupled with a receding Dollar ahead of the RBA’s much anticipated 25bps cut to its Cash Rate (full preview available in the Research Suite). Participants are on the look-out for guidance into the aggressiveness of the easing cycle, with the potential for limited downside movement in the AUD/USD as markets have priced in “too much short” in the AUD, as according to UBS. AUD/USD is set to end the EU session closer to the top of a 0.6926-64 range with clean air to the upside until the psych 0.7000 level, whilst the downside sees psych support at 0.6850. Meanwhile, the Kiwi was bolstered by the aforementioned Chinese data and fared better than its antipodean counterpart as the AUD/NZD cross remained below its 200 DMA at 1.0624 and hovered around the 1.0600 level ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.0571. Finally, USD/CAD is back below the 1.3500 (vs. an intraday high of 1.3527), with the decline in the USD and firmer oil prices outmuscling downbeat Canadian manufacturing PMI, with decent support seen at 1.3482 (May 28th low) ahead of another support at 1.3425 (May 27th low).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Ultimately firmer on the day, again potentially as a function of a receding Buck, after little reaction was experienced amid unrevised French, German and EZ manufacturing PMIs. EUR/USD is set to end the EU session around the 1.1200 level (vs. low of 1.1157), ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.1208. Looking ahead, EZ flash inflation figures are due to be released tomorrow with headline expected to cool to 1.3% from 1.7%. Meanwhile, UK’s manufacturing sector slipped into contraction, with new orders and employment both declining whilst stockpiling paused following the Brexit delay. In terms of Brexit developments, and increasing number new members line up for the Tory leadership, with the latest from Environmental Sectary Gove, a front runner, reportedly considering a further extension beyond October 31st, whilst leading candidate Johnson said that if he is elected, the UK will leave the bloc with or without a deal on Brexit day. GBP/USD set to end the EU day little changed around the 1.2630 mark with little by way of near-term technicals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>A divergence is seen in the safe haven currencies, with the Franc firmer on the day and below parity vs the Buck, albeit off lows after the pair bounced off support at its 200 DMA (0.9958). Meanwhile, USD/JPY is set to end the EU session in the green, potentially on an unwind in Yen position as US stocks crawled back into positive territory throughout the day. USD/JPY is poised to end the EU session around 108.50, having opened around 108.28.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another downbeat day for the Peso in a continuation from Trump’s tariff announcement last week. Rhetoric from Mexico has been less confrontational in comparison to the US, although the Mexican Foreign Minister did note that tariff increase threatens the USMCA deal. USD/MXN is poised to conclude EU trade closer to the middle of today’s 19.60-80 range as the Mexican delegation continues talks in Washington. Elsewhere, the Lira has retraced some of last week’s gains, albeit only marginally, with the aid of softer-than-forecast inflation figures which allows the CBRT to start considering a policy ease. USD/TRY is set to end the day back above its 50 DMA (5.8597) having fluctuated within a 5.83-89 intraday band.</p>",

Some upside was offered, however, by the disappointing Markit PMI data with the New Orders Index falling to contractionary territory for first time since August 2009.

Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stated that the Kingdom is committed to do whatever is required to stabilise oil markets; adding that he is confident, based on discussion with several oil producers, that they will do what is required to keep market stability after June, more specifically, by drawing inventories. Also, out of Saudi were reports that its production level is currently at 9.65mln BPD, down from the previous 10.05mln, keeping well below its OPEC+ cut quota of 10.3mln.</li><li>In recent weeks <strong>oil has been taking its cues from the faltering global demand outlook, particularly the sell off in SPX</strong>. Analysts at SEB comment, “The market is now trading oil on the basis of learning from last year: Oil = S&amp;P 500.” The note goes on to suggest that there is “significant risk that the market is overselling Brent crude,” highlighting that fundamentals differ this time around due to OPEC+’s commitment to cutting supply. On a similar vein, Goldman suggest that, “A still tight EU crude market, the suddenness of the move lower, OPEC’s reluctance to increase supply and our economists above consensus growth forecast all suggest prices may recover from here.” Goldman caveats their statement saying that due to macro and US inventory headwinds, prices should remain around their Q3 forecasts (USD 65/bbl for Brent), “albeit with still high price volatility.”</li><li>Speculators cut their WTI net long positions by 38k contracts to 212k and Brent speculators cut their net long positions by 41k to 353k in the most recent week, Reuters energy analyst John Kemp highlights this being “<strong>the heaviest one-week selling since October 2018.</strong>” Kemp notes that from a positioning perspective, in the six major petroleum futures and options (Brent, WTI, US gasoline, US heating oil and Euro gasoil), where hedge fund long positions outnumber shorts by a ratio of 5:1 (down from the year’s peak of just under 9:1, but still exceeding the low of 2:1 at the beginning of the year), “some but not all the downside risk has been reduced by the sale of excess bullish positions.”</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/8a654bb5-2556-4f97-9155-37ac11a74f01.jpg\"></figure>",

Nonetheless, a risk averse tone was seen from the reopen after <strong>China released a white paper that blamed the US for the setback of trade talks which pressured US equity futures</strong> to extend on the losses from Wall St’s worst May performance since 2010. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.2%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) </strong>declined with the energy sector the underperformer in Australia after the recent oil slump, while safe-haven currency flows weighed on Tokyo stocks and with weakness in SoftBank exacerbated on reports of funding difficulties for its next USD 100bln tech fund. <strong>Hang Seng (U/C)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%)</strong> were initially higher after the PBoC maintained net liquidity through CNY 80bln of reverse repos and after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing topped estimates, although the gains were short-lived as trade concerns remained heavily in focus with China playing the blame game, while it is also set to draft its own blacklist of 'unreliable' entities and probe FedEx over possible infringement of Huawei’s legal rights regarding rerouted packages. Finally, 10yr JGBs were steady with only marginal gains seen despite the widespread risk aversion and the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 800bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p><p><strong>China State Council Information Office released a white paper which formalized its position on trade negotiations</strong> and <strong>stated that the US government bears the responsibility for setback in trade talks</strong>, while it also noted that China does not want a trade war but is not afraid of one either. However, <strong>China also suggested negotiations remain a priority</strong> and State Councillor/Defence Minister Wei Fenghe said both sides should follow the consensus by the 2 heads of state and promote a relationship involving coordination, cooperation and stability, while a researcher at the state-backed think tank China Center for International Economic Exchanges suggested China “is expressing its wish to work together”.

Throughout the mornings trade bourses have been grinding higher but are still in negative territory [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.1%]; sectors are mixed on the day with some moderate outperformance seen in Utilities, which Nomura Quants note is not sufficient to trigger an excessive volatility shock as the sell-off in cyclicals in minimal compared with prior selloffs. Notable movers this morning include Infineon (-6.4%) who are near the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after it was reported that they are to acquire Cypress Semiconductors for an enterprise value of EUR 8bln; Co’s boards have already consented to this acquisition. Elsewhere, airline names are somewhat subdued after reports that the global airline industry is to record its lowest profit in five-years, particularly easyJet (-2.1%) which is also weighed on following reports that the Co. are this week to drop out of the FTSE 100 (-0.4%). At the other end of the Stoxx, and topping the DAX are Wirecard (+2.3%) following the CEO stating they expect an outstanding H1.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - Overall little changed on the day thus far, following on from a relatively subdued session overnight as the index remains sub-98.00 ahead of this week’s key risk events which includes US ISM manufacturing PMI, ECB’s monetary policy meeting and US jobs data. The index remains near the middle of the intraday 97.57-80 range with gains capped by bleeding US yields.</p><p>EUR/GBP - Hardly fazed on manufacturing PMI day in which the EZ number was unrevised (as expected) whilst UK’s manufacturing sector slipped into contraction, with new orders and employment both declining whilst stockpiling paused following the Brexit delay. Sterling remains dedicated to Brexit related development as new members line up for the Tory leadership, with the latest from Environmental Sectary Gove, a front runner, reportedly considering a further extension beyond October 31st, whilst leading candidate Johnson said that if he is elected, the UK will leave the bloc with or without a deal on Brexit day. EUR/USD remains within a relatively tight 1.1157-90 range with clean air to the upside until the 1.1200 handle. Beyond that, the pair’s 50 DMA resides around 1.1208 with resistance seen at 1.1264 (May high). Meanwhile, Cable hovers around the 1.2650 mark with little seen to the upside by way of near-term tech levels.&nbsp;</p><p>CHF/JPY - Both firmer on the day, albeit the Yen to a lesser extent, in a continuation of the Trump triggered risk-off mood around the market. USD/JPY fell to whisker away from the 108.00 level (low 108.08) whilst its Franc counterpart slipped further below parity vs. the Greenback. Deutsche Bank recommends “good news rallies should be sold as trade tensions may get relief rallies” as the JPY-crosses “should remain under pressure”. It’s worth keeping in mind USD/JPY sees almost 1bln in option expiries at 108.00-15 ahead of supports at 107.77 and 107.27 (Jan 10 low and 61.8% Fib respectively) whilst USD/CHF sees its 200 DMA at 0.9959 (having already tested the level) ahead of its 200 WMA at 0.9847.</p><p>AUD/NZD - Marginally firmer in the aftermath of optimistic China Caixin manufacturing data which provided the antipodeans with some relief following last week’s losses. AUD/USD hovers around the 0.6950 mark (high 0.6960, low 0.6928) despite a looming RBA rate cut, with participants on the look-out for guidance into the aggressiveness of the much-anticipated easing cycle. Meanwhile, its antipodean counterpart seems to be benefiting more as the AUD/NZD cross breached its 200 DMA (1.0624) as it tests the 1.0600 level ahead of its 50 DMA (1.0571)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Fixed income yields have kicked off the day in the red, with slipping yields spurred on by trade once again as the Chinese contingent released their formalized position on trade negotiations, not unsurprisingly blaming the US for the setback. This has seen core EU and UK 10yr debt futures trade with gains of over 20 ticks each. Bunds saw little inspiration from the unrevised manufacturing PMIs in Germany and the EZ, but 10yr Gilt futures surged past their daily peaks to set a new liffe high of 130.04 after UK Manufacturing PMI slipped into contractionary territory as a result of halted stockpiling activity after the Brexit delay.</p><p>Moving stateside, futures are higher across the curve with the longer end outperforming and some bull steepening noted. This comes as the aforementioned trade tensions, alongside comments from Fed’s Daly stating that tariffs have contributed to inflation, have driven demand for debt. 10yr yields thus have slipped to their lowest point since 2017 at 2.08%, and 2 year yields are set for their biggest 2 day fall since the crisis, with 23bps already shed. Traders will now be looking forward to the US manufacturing PMI print ahead of potential comments from Fed’s Quarles, Bullard and Barkin.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures are recovering off Asia-Pac lows with the former back above the 53.00/bbl handle and climbing towards the next round figure, whilst the latter is attempting to turn positive on the day having already dipped below the 61.00/bbl figure overnight</strong>. The weekend saw the release of Russian May crude production which stood at an 11-month low at 11.11mln BPD, down from last month’s 11.24mln BPD, although this was mainly due closures from the Druzbha pipeline due to oil contamination. Elsewhere, Saudi reported a M/M decline in oil output to 9.65mln BPD from the prior 10.05mln BPD, whilst the Kingdom’s energy minister stated that Saudi is committed to do whatever is required to stabilise the oil market. GS takes into account the supply/demand side concerns and net-net expects prices to remain volatile in the coming months, albeit around current levels. Turning to OPEC, the bank sees higher production from Saudi, Russia, UAE and Kuwait to offset Iranian and Venezuelan shortfalls. Thus, GS expects backwardation to persist in the coming months, whilst also revising lower its Q2 Brent forecast to 65.50/bbl from 72.50/bbl, also citing spare capacity created by a new Permian pipeline. Elsewhere, gold (+0.7%) benefits from its safe haven characteristics and extends gains above its 1300/oz level whilst copper prices are seeing some reprieve following last week’s slump as the red metal was underpinned by optimistic Caixin manufacturing data from China.</p><p>Goldman Sachs suggest that oil prices may recover from here due to a tight EU crude market, sudden moves lower, OPEC's reluctance to increase supply and above consensus growth forecasts, However, increasingly uncertain macro outlook, rising production an OPEC spare capacity suggests prices at likely to remain around current levels with high volatility. (Newswires)</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih states that Saudi Arabia are committed to do whatever is required to stabilise oil markets, adds that he is confident based on discussion with several oil producers that we will do what is required to keep market stability after June, by drawing inventories down from their current elevated levels. (Newswires)</p><p>Russian Deputy Energy Minister expects steps to resolve the contaminated oil situation to be carried out as planned. (Newswires)</p><p>Norwegian Oil Industry says that a strike would reduce output by 440k BPD. (Newswires)</p>",

This positioning is not seen as being sufficient to trigger an excessive volatility shock, as the sell off of cyclicals, when compared with recent prior selloffs, has been minimal.</li><li>Looking ahead, Nomura believe that speculators are making trades based on a US recession, if this was to be exacerbated by a poor data print the focus would be on if CTA’s continue their net selling for longer than 7 trading-days; as this would be indicative of the selling no-longer being predominantly technical and therefore market consensus that the&nbsp; US economy is heading to a recession is increasing.</li><li>Within FX CTAs are seen as undertaking more risk-averse trades, with long positions in safe-havens increasing versus the USD, particularly USD/JPY shorts which are nearing levels from August 2016, alongside short positions on high-beta currencies.</li><li>On JPY specifically, Nomura highlight that it would not be unsurprising if USD/JPY fell below the 106.0 handle on systematic buying of the JPY.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Overall little changed on the day thus far, following on from a relatively subdued session overnight as the index remains sub-98.00 ahead of this week’s key risk events which includes US ISM manufacturing PMI, ECB’s monetary policy meeting and US jobs data. The index remains near the middle of the intraday 97.57-80 range with gains capped by bleeding US yields.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Hardly fazed on manufacturing PMI day in which the EZ number was unrevised (as expected) whilst UK’s manufacturing sector slipped into contraction, with new orders and employment both declining whilst stockpiling paused following the Brexit delay. Sterling remains dedicated to Brexit related development as new members line up for the Tory leadership, with the latest from Environmental Sectary Gove, a front runner, reportedly considering a further extension beyond October 31st, whilst leading candidate Johnson said that if he is elected, the UK will leave the bloc with or without a deal on Brexit day. EUR/USD remains within a relatively tight 1.1157-90 range with clean air to the upside until the 1.1200 handle. Beyond that, the pair’s 50 DMA resides around 1.1208 with resistance seen at 1.1264 (May high). Meanwhile, Cable hovers around the 1.2650 mark with little seen to the upside by way of near-term tech levels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Both firmer on the day, albeit the Yen to a lesser extent, in a continuation of the Trump triggered risk-off mood around the market. USD/JPY fell to whisker away from the 108.00 level (low 108.08) whilst its Franc counterpart slipped further below parity vs. the Greenback. Deutsche Bank recommends “good news rallies should be sold as trade tensions may get relief rallies” as the JPY-crosses “should remain under pressure”. It’s worth keeping in mind USD/JPY sees almost 1bln in option expiries at 108.00-15 ahead of supports at 107.77 and 107.27 (Jan 10 low and 61.8% Fib respectively) whilst USD/CHF sees its 200 DMA at 0.9959 (having already tested the level) ahead of its 200 WMA at 0.9847.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Marginally firmer in the aftermath of optimistic China Caixin manufacturing data which provided the antipodeans with some relief following last week’s losses. AUD/USD hovers around the 0.6950 mark (high 0.6960, low 0.6928) despite a looming RBA rate cut, with participants on the look-out for guidance into the aggressiveness of the much-anticipated easing cycle. Meanwhile, its antipodean counterpart seems to be benefiting more as the AUD/NZD cross breached its 200 DMA (1.0624) as it tests the 1.0600 level ahead of its 50 DMA (1.0571)</p>",

This has seen core EU and UK 10yr debt futures trade with gains of over 20 ticks each. Bunds saw little inspiration from the unrevised manufacturing PMIs in Germany and the EZ, but 10yr Gilt futures surged past their daily peaks to set a new liffe high of 130.04 after UK Manufacturing PMI slipped into contractionary territory as a result of halted stockpiling activity after the Brexit delay.</p><p>Moving stateside, futures are higher across the curve with the longer end outperforming and some bull steepening noted. This comes as the aforementioned trade tensions, alongside comments from Fed’s Daly stating that tariffs have contributed to inflation, have driven demand for debt. 10yr yields thus have slipped to their lowest point since 2017 at 2.08%, and 2 year yields are set for their biggest 2 day fall since the crisis, with 23bps already shed. Traders will now be looking forward to the US manufacturing PMI print ahead of potential comments from Fed’s Quarles, Bullard and Barkin.</p>",

Nonetheless, a risk averse tone was seen from the reopen after China released a white paper that blamed the US for the setback of trade talks which pressured US equity futures to extend on the losses from Wall St’s worst May performance since 2010. ASX 200 (-1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) declined with the energy sector the underperformer in Australia after the recent oil slump, while safe-haven currency flows weighed on Tokyo stocks and with weakness in SoftBank exacerbated on reports of funding difficulties for its next USD 100bln tech fund. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) were initially higher after the PBoC maintained net liquidity through CNY 80bln of reverse repos and after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing topped estimates, although the gains were short-lived as trade concerns remained heavily in focus with China playing the blame game, while it is also set to draft its own blacklist of 'unreliable' entities and probe FedEx over possible infringement of Huawei’s legal rights regarding rerouted packages. Finally, 10yr JGBs were steady with only marginal gains seen despite the widespread risk aversion and the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 800bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are negative with sentiment subdued as the US faces a 2-front trade war against China and Mexico, although stronger than expected Caixin PMI data has helped limit losses in China. Nonetheless, a risk averse tone was seen from the reopen after China released a white paper that blamed the US for the setback of trade talks which pressured US equity futures to extend on the losses from Wall St’s worst performance in May since 2010. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) are lower with the energy sector underperforming in Australia after the recent oil slump, while safe-haven currency flows weigh on Tokyo stocks and with losses in SoftBank exacerbated on reports of funding difficulties for its next USD 100bln tech fund. Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) were initially higher after the PBoC maintained net liquidity through CNY 80bln of reverse repos and after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing topped estimates, although the gains were short-lived as trade concerns remained heavily in focus with China playing the blame game, while it is also set to draft its own blacklist of 'unreliable' entities and probe FedEx over possible infringement of Huawei’s legal rights regarding rerouted packages.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued after having fallen firmly below the 98.00 level on Friday as the tariff announcement on Mexico weighed on NAFTA currencies and with the greenback also losing out to declining yields, as well as safe-haven flows into JPY which dragged USD/JPY to the bottom end of the 108.00 handle. Elsewhere, EUR/USD and GBP/USD extend on Friday’s gains amid the USD-woes and antipodeans are also lifted despite the anticipation for a looming rate cut by the RBA tomorrow and holiday closure in New Zealand, while CNH also takes a swipe at the greenback after the better than expected Chinese PMI data and stronger fix by the PBoC.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher but with gains only mild despite the widespread risk aversion and with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 800bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p>",
