While stimulus efforts in the past week have supported the, on a historical basis, extraordinary rally, it has come in the context of even more extraordinary losses – many are recognising the gains as a “bear market rally” / “bull trap”. Barclays’ strategists highlight the two uncertainties facing investors, how long the economic quarantine will be required and the resulting damage, which it believes keeps medium-term risks skewed to the downside. The decline in risk appetite supported the bid in government debt as the TPLEX bull-steepened, supported the Fed’s continued asset purchases. The dollar continued lower after one of its worst ever weeks - hats to Federal Reserve efforts to ease funding pressures (the 3-month Term repo operation saw zero bids on Friday). Oil prices continued to move lower amid the bleak outlook and no signs of Russia / Saudi cooperation.</p><h2>CASE COUNT</h2><p><strong>WORLDWIDE CASES 588,959, DEATHS 26,928, RECOVERED 132,440.</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Friday (via worldometer website) against Thursday:</p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>total cases 100,037 (prev. 85,435), death toll 1,536 (prev. 1,295).</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 86,498 (prev. 80,589), death toll 9,134 (prev. 8,215).</li><li><strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 81,340 (prev. 81,285), death toll 3,292 (prev. 3,287).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 64,059 (prev. 57,786), death toll 4,934 (prev. 4,365).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 50,178 (prev. 43,938), death toll 338 (prev. 267).</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 32,964 (prev. 29,155), death toll 1,995 (prev. 1,696).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>total cases 14,543 (prev. 11,658), death toll 759 (prev. 578).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>total cases 12,928 (prev. 11,811), death toll 231 (prev. 192).</li><li><strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 9,332 (prev. 9,241), death toll 139 (prev. 131).</li><li><strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 8,603 (prev. 7,431), death toll 546 (prev. 434).</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 4,610 (prev. 4,043), death toll 53 (prev. 39).</li></ul><p><i>Note figures are provided via </i><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\"><i>worldometers</i></a><i> thus there may be some discrepancies on figures provided against those stated from individual states.</i></p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The House passed the USD 2.2trln stimulus bill, sending the bill to President Trump to sign off on. Trump said he would sign off on the bill immediately on Friday.</p><p><strong>CHINA / US: </strong>Chinese President Xi, in a call with US President Trump, noted that China is willing to enhance macroeconomic policy coordination to stabilise markets and secure growth, state TV reported, adding that China-US relations are at an important juncture. China is reportedly willing to offer support to the US regarding virus control. Trump confirmed the call, saying that both nations agreed to work closely. Trump also said earlier that the US can do another trade deal with China, but it will have to wait until after the election.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>US President Trump said he will early next week provide information on relaxing guidelines on social distancing; Trump also said there is \"no way\" that he would cancel the Republican National Convention in August, according to Fox. US VP Pence said Trump will be presented with options on opening the economy up this weekend. Elsewhere, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers have urged the Trump administration to defer all tariffs during the pandemic, for at least a 90-day period, or until the crisis has passed.</p><p><strong>CANADA </strong>PM Trudeau announced the government will cover 75% of payroll wages, while wage subsidies to SMEs will be backdated to March 15th. Trudeau said further details on aid to SMEs will be announced “hopefully by Monday”. In a joint press conference with BoC Governor Poloz, Finance Minister Morneau said the government is ready to do whatever it takes, adding that it is providing CAD 65bln in direct support to SME's and CAD 30bln in deferred taxes. Morneau said Canada is trying to make sure that it guarantees credit to the oil and gas sector, particularly SMEs, although is still working on the details. The Finance Minister said Canada is putting out roughly 5% of GDP or more, excluding credit, adding it may need to do more; noting there is no spending cap for the government.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>BOC, </strong>in an emergency move, cut another 50bps of its overnight benchmark rate to 0.25%, its effective lower bound, from 0.75%, while also launching two new programmes. In fitting with other central banks, the BoC launched a Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP) to help alleviate strains in the short-term funding markets and preserve a key source of funding for businesses. The Central Bank also initiated QE where it will purchase Canadian Government securities in the secondary market and start at a minimum of $5bln per week across the curve and it noted the purchases can be adjusted as conditions warrant, but it will continue until the economic recovery is “well underway”. The BoC stated it remains ready to act further if necessary, to support the Canadian economy and financial system to keep inflation on target, stressing today’s action was taken to support the financial system in its central role of providing credit in the economy, and to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy. Note, this latest move is the third consecutive 50bp cut this month, following its scheduled announcement on March 4th and the emergency announcement March 13th. The press conference followed with Governor Poloz who, in fitting with the statement, stressed that the move was to restore the function of financial markets rather than traditional monetary stimulus. Poloz reiterated that negative rates are a part of the Bank’s toolkit, although he does not see rates going lower than the current level, however he noted theoretically it could be lowered to -0.5%, although the governor stressed&nbsp; the significant negative effects on the financial system seen from other nations with NIRP and the bank is not contemplating using it. On QE, the Governor added the BoC will announce a true QE programme with a set of objectives when it is implemented and it is currently seeking to restore market function, while reiterating the statement that they will purchase bonds for as long as necessary. RBC highlight that if the purchases continue at the minimum rate of $5blnI for half a year, the size of the BoC’s balance sheet would more than double. In regards to the CPPP, Poloz stated the commercial paper market is effectively frozen and the bank wants to ensure that credit is available, hence the initiation of the CPPP facility. RBC believe that the banks next step if needed would be to increase the pace of asset purchases and “potentially broaden their scope”. This could mean “mean buying more GoC securities or ramping up CMB purchases to more QE-like levels. We also wouldn't rule out more substantial purchases of provincial and corporate securities to address wider spreads in those markets, if needed.”, the Canadian Bank writes. RBC conclude that today’s policy announcement looks appropriate at this stage, but it is impossible to rule out the need to do more given the current market conditions.</p><p><strong>FED FACILITIES:</strong> US banks had USD 50.8bln of outstanding loans via the Discount Window, as of Wednesday (vs USD 28.2bln last week), according to Fed data. This will be encouraging to the Fed after it has made efforts to incentivize and destigmatize the facility. Elsewhere, the overnight repo operation saw continued minimal demand and its 3-month Term operations saw zero bids. The lack of demand for cash was once again exhibited in the high take-up in the reverse repo operation, which received USD 210bln in bids across 43 bidders – note that demand has been ramping up in recent sessions.</p><p><strong>ECB </strong>said that banks should not pay dividends until at least October 2020. French Finance Minister Le Maire later said the government will not guarantee loans for companies that pay dividends.</p><h2>REST OF WORLD</h2><p><strong>EUROPEAN STIMULUS: </strong>EU leaders have given finance ministers two weeks to sort out technical details of the bailout fund credit lines for the Eurozone to fight the crisis. This follows reports from the northern states that they opposed a common debt issuance (coronabonds) as a measure to best combat the virus; conversely, states such as Italy, with already strained fiscal budgets, have come out in support of joint issuance.</p><p><strong>UK PM JOHNSON HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONA VIRUS.</strong> He has mild symptoms and will self-isolate in Downing Street. Johnson will still be in charge of the government's handling of the crisis. The announcement did cause some downside in Cable, moving from circa 1.2280 to 1.2240 before subsequently extending to the downside. Health Minister Hancock also tested positive. It was reported that other Cabinet members, such as Chancellor Sunak, may have to self-isolate after being in contact, although a Treasury source said the Chancellor was not doing such.</p><p><strong>FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON</strong> said he and US President Trump are preparing \"a strong new initiative\" with other nations, which will be unveiled in the coming days. Elsewhere, France announced it was extending the lockdown for another two weeks until April 15th.</p><p><strong>ITALY </strong>may require new stimulus worth EUR 30bln, according to Il Sole; note on Thursday reports noted that Italian PM Conte is aiming for a new stimulus package worth in excess of EUR 25bln.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>PERSONAL INCOME &amp; SPENDING (FEB):</strong> Given the data is for February it could be deemed rather stale as it was taken before the coronavirus took its toll on the US economy. Nonetheless, Personal income rose 0.6% maintaining the prior pace, which was above expectations for a 0.4% read, while consumption was in line with expectations and continued to rise at 0.2%. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlights the rise in income was boosted by the one-time farm subsidy payments while “regular private sector wages and salaries rose by a solid 0.5%”. The consultancy notes the next two months will be very different and that Q1 spending was on course for a 1.6% increase annually, although “the 5% month-to-month drop we expect to see in March, capturing the initial collapse in spending on discretionary goods and services, suggests spending for the quarter will plunge at a 5-1/2% rate. And Q2 will be much worse.” Core PCE Y/Y rose 1.8% from 1.7%, 0.1% above expectations and the highest since August, while the MM figure maintained its 0.2% pace, in line with expectations. Non-core PCE maintained a 1.8% rise Y/Y and 0.1% pace M/M. Pantheon Macroeconomics, in reference to the core reading, expects the gains will not last but still expects a small M/M increase in March, although expects it to fall in April and May as the financial services component drops sharply, which the consultancy notes lags the stock market. Looking ahead, PM says in July the Y/Y rate will “likely be below 1.0% or less”.</p><p><strong>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FINAL (MARCH):</strong> Headline sentiment came in at 89.1, worse than the expected fall to 90 from 95.9; the sharpest drop since October 2008. Conditions fell to 103.7 from 112.5 and expectations fell to 79.7 from 85.3. All three metrics were the lowest since October 2016. The inflation expectations ticked down slightly to 2.2% from 2.3%, for both the 1-year and 5-year prints. “The economics of fear are now in plain sight”, writes Oxford Economics, which highlights that the fall is a huge understatement as the survey was conducted prior to March 11th, before coronavirus responses instructed further lockdowns across the US bringing the economy to a halt. On the employment front, OxEco highlight “The share of respondents expecting more unemployment over the next year rose from 23% in February to 39%; that share is likely to go much higher.”</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 1.09 LOWER AT USD 21.51/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 0.70 LOWER AT USD 27.95/BBL.</strong></p><p><strong>OIL PRICES CAME UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN TO END THE WEEK</strong>, alongside a decline in equities, as the outlook remains dismal for the energy complex. There are little fundamental reasons to get long for many participants as global growth and oil demand faces a cliff edge. Meanwhile, Russia and Saudi remain in a price war. Saudi’s Energy Ministry said there have been no contact between Saudi and Russia over increasing the number of OPEC+ countries, no discussion of a joint agreement to balance oil markets. The comments followed on from earlier remarks by the Algerian Oil Minister, who called for an extraordinary OPEC panel meeting; the Russian Deputy Energy Minister also said that OPEC+ members remain in close contact. The Russian official elsewhere said that oil production in the US could fall by 1.5mln BPD in 2020 if oil prices are between USD 30-35/bbl; later adding that if prices remain around USD 25/bbl for two to three years, big problems will occur. Meanwhile, Unipec is the latest to announce it would not be lifting any additional Saudi crude in April due to raised shipping costs. The latest Baker Hughes US rig count (w/e 27th March): Oil -40 at 624, Nat Gas -4 at 102, Total -44 at 728; marking the largest drop in oil rigs since 2015.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 17 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-08+.</strong></p><p>THE TPLEX BULL FLATTENED amid a decline in risk assets and active Fed operations. The bid gained steam as European trade commenced while equities trundled lower. One desk highlights the lower volumes, which had previously been swamped by short covering, hedging and spread unwinds, is making the Fed’s asset purchases felt more acutely in the tape action. Furthermore, the Fed’s aggressive liquidity options have drastically cut the dollar funding pressures, where repo operations continue to see minimal take-up, with Dealers taking advantage of the reverse repo operation as yields in front-end Bills flirt with negative territory, seeing yield-thirsty participants move further out the curve. By settlement, 30s -8bps at 1.316%, 10s -7.5bps at 0.733%, 2s -2bps at 0.254%.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -3.33% at 2543, NDX -3.91% at 7588, DJIA -4.06% at 21,637</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -6.93%, Technology -4.61%, Industrials -4.33%, Communication Svs -4.09%, Materials -3.81%, Cons Disc -3.37%, Financials -3.31%, Health -2.41%, Cons Stpl -0.72%, Real Estate -0.07%, Utilities +0.52%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Defensives the relative outperformers with Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP) and Real Estate marginally lower in comparison, while Health Care (XLV) followed. XLP aided as consumers continue to stockpile staple goods and cleaning supplies (CLX), while Pepsi (PEP) managed to close flat despite a double upgrade to Outperform from Credit Suisse, Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) were upgraded to Buy from Hold at Stifel seeing solid gains. Energy (XLE) the underperforming sector falling roughly 7% amid weaker oil prices as there still seems to be no end in sight for the Russia/Saudi pricing war as comments from Saudi Arabia stated there is no discussion regarding joint output cuts, nor about increasing the size of OPEC+.&nbsp; Elsewhere, cruise liners were hit after WSJ reported&nbsp; big cruise liners will not qualify for aid under the US stimulus package after a last minute legislative change has shut the companies out of the coronavirus bill as the Democrats and Labor had opposed aid to the offshore based cruise industry. While Carnival (CCL) is reportedly looking for up to USD 7bln in new debt. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) announced it is furloughing 41k workers, while big banks (XLF, BAC, WFC, DB, JPM, GS, MS) are reportedly reassuring staff and postponing decisions about potential job cuts as they are worried about being unprepared if business suddenly picks up. L Brands (LB) announce it is to suspend its dividend from Q2 while closing its stores until further notice. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working with the White House to create an app which will provide CDC guidance to users. Lululemon (LULU) fell over 5% despite tom and bottom-line beats, while reporting comparable store sales +9%, however, it did withdraw its guidance. United Tech (UTX) and Raytheon (RTN) had its deal approved by the DoJ, subject to conditions that it sells all assets related to military airborne radios, GPS systems and its optical systems businesses. United Airlines (UAL) states it will not go ahead with involuntary furloughs or pay cuts in the US before September 30th although if the recovery is as slow as it fears, its airline and workforce will have to be smaller. UAL stated it doesn’t expect travel demand to snap back for some time and expects demand to remain suppressed perhaps into next year. The airline also expects load factors to fall into the teens or single digits even with 60% less capacity. Tesla (TSLA) is to reportedly cut staff at its battery plant in Nevada by 75% amid COVID-19. Gap (GPS) announced it has drawn down USD 500mln, 100% of its revolving credit facility, and it is deferring the payment dates for its Q1 dividend while suspending any quarterly dividends for the remainder of FY20 and withdrawing guidance.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP: YEN GATHERS MORE MOMENTUM AMIDST RISK-OFF FRIDAY MOVES</strong></p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>108.00 held for a while, but the Yen subsequently posted fresh highs for the week above the round number on safe-haven positioning following a breach of the 200 DMA in Usd/Jpy (108.29) and an extended retreat from circa 111.70. Japan is far from immune in terms of the global nCoV pandemic and the BoJ has stepped up stimulus via increased purchases of securities, while the Government has approved a supplementary budget, but contagion is arguably worse elsewhere. Hence, the Yen has reasserted its credentials as the go to currency for investors and speculators paring back risk exposure or liquidating, especially as month, quarter and fy end looms next Tuesday. In contrast, the Dollar has handed back more gains alongside dissipating stress in credit and diminishing demand for liquidity/funding purposes, with the DXY pulling back further from ytd peaks through 100.000 and all the way down under Fib support around 98.840 before arresting the slide.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>A distinctly better week for the Pound, albeit after Cable swooned towards 1985 lows again and Eur/Gbp traded close to 0.9400 at one stage, as Sterling benefits from more short covering on top of the aforementioned Greenback retracement. Indeed, Cable managed to form a series of higher lows throughout the week from circa 1.1450 to eventually fill a key technical retracement gap (50% Fib of fall from 1.3200 to 1.1412) before topping out and recoiling to sub-1.2200 levels when news broke that UK PM Johnson has contracted the coronavirus, and then rebounding beyond 1.2400 when the Buck came under pressure again and stops were triggered through a series of upside tech levels (including the 21 DMA). For the record, normally top tier data in the form of CPI and retail sales (at the new earlier 7.00GMT ONS release time) was largely shrugged off, along with preliminary PMIs even though the surveys were bleak overall and the BoE flagged their importance after previously playing down the role of the findings in terms of policy deliberations. On that note, the scheduled March MPC meeting passed without much fanfare as rates and APF were left as is following the 2 emergency eases and new QE tranche earlier this month.</p><p><strong>USD: </strong>Aside from losing the tag of cash king due in no small part to the Fed expanding and enhancing swap lines, the Dollar was undermined by a staggering jump in US initial claims that completely blitzed the prior all time apex, at almost 3.3 mn. Moreover, there is a reasonable and rational thesis, rather than conspiratorial, the number could have been even higher if all applications lodged were processed instead of agency staff ploughing through as many as possible due to the overload.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>Although Italy has become the new COVID-19 epicentre and Spain’s confirmed case/fatality count seems to be catching up, the single currency remains on track to net gains vs the Buck within a wide 1.1086-1.0638 range. However, the single currency has weakened independently, between 0.8940-0.9390 against the Pound and 1.0653-1.0531 vs the Franc amidst uncertainty and ongoing bickering over a coordinated fiscal response to the virus from Eurozone Governments, including the use of OMTs to supplement ECB efforts like the QE envelope and PEPP that kicked in this week.</p><p><strong>CHF: </strong>Swiss bank sight deposits continue to rise, while the Government and SNB have injected more forms of liquidity and credit, but the even more highly valued Franc is still appreciating with Usd/Chf eyeing a new base near 0.9555 compared to almost 0.9900 at the other end of the spectrum.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD: </strong>Very volatile weeks and a somewhat contrasting final trading session for the non-US Dollars, as the Antipodes mostly danced to the risk sentiment tune that changed tone several times, though also moved in lock-step with other G10 peers inversely to their US counterpart. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are ending near or at fresh peaks around 0.6134 and 0.6029 respectively, but Usd/Cad has bounced from sub-1.4000 in wake of the BoC’s 3rd impromptu 50 bp rate cut that came with QE and a Fed-style commercial paper buying vehicle given that conventional policy has now reached the lower bound. Nevertheless, Governor Poloz did not rule out NIRP altogether and the Loonie is still off worst levels vs its US rival circa 1.4560.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM: </strong>Also victims and sometimes criminals over the course of yet another manic, frantic and often fickle 5 days in FX land, but the Scandi Crowns have fared well on technical grounds irrespective of crude’s latest capitulation that normally undermines the Nok in particular, and the spectre of Norges Bank intervention continues to impact. Conversely, the Rub has been hit hard by Brent’s sharp retreat from recent recovery highs and no sign of Russia or Saudi Arabia settling the dispute over prices and share of the dwindling spoils. Meanwhile, the spread of nCoV is taking an increasing and wider toll to the extent that the BCB may now be on the brink of buying bonds and SA is in grave danger of losing its last non-junk ratings standing when Moody’s delivers its long awaited review.</p>",

There are little fundamental reasons to get long for many participants as global growth and oil demand faces a cliff edge. Meanwhile, Russia and Saudi remain in a price war. Saudi’s Energy Ministry said there have been no contact between Saudi and Russia over increasing the number of OPEC+ countries, no discussion of a joint agreement to balance oil markets. The comments followed on from earlier remarks by the Algerian Oil Minister, who called for an extraordinary OPEC panel meeting; the Russian Deputy Energy Minister also said that OPEC+ members remain in close contact. The Russian official elsewhere said that oil production in the US could fall by 1.5mln BPD in 2020 if oil prices are between USD 30-35/bbl; later adding that if prices remain around USD 25/bbl for two to three years, big problems will occur. Meanwhile, Unipec is the latest to announce it would not be lifting any additional Saudi crude in April due to raised shipping costs. The latest Baker Hughes US rig count (w/e 27th March): Oil -40 at 624, Nat Gas -4 at 102, Total -44 at 728; marking the largest drop in oil rigs since 2015.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Yen gathers more momentum amidst risk-off Friday moves",
        "content": "<p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>108.00 held for a while, but the Yen subsequently posted fresh highs for the week above the round number on safe-haven positioning following a breach of the 200 DMA in Usd/Jpy (108.29) and an extended retreat from circa 111.70. Japan is far from immune in terms of the global nCoV pandemic and the BoJ has stepped up stimulus via increased purchases of securities, while the Government has approved a supplementary budget, but contagion is arguably worse elsewhere. Hence, the Yen has reasserted its credentials as the go to currency for investors and speculators paring back risk exposure or liquidating, especially as month, quarter and fy end looms next Tuesday. In contrast, the Dollar has handed back more gains alongside dissipating stress in credit and diminishing demand for liquidity/funding purposes, with the <strong>DXY</strong> pulling back further from ytd peaks through 100.000 and all the way down under Fib support around 98.840 before arresting the slide.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A distinctly better week for the Pound, albeit after Cable swooned towards 1985 lows again and Eur/Gbp traded close to 0.9400 at one stage, as Sterling benefits from more short covering on top of the aforementioned Greenback retracement. Indeed, Cable managed to form a series of higher lows throughout the week from circa 1.1450 to eventually fill a key technical retracement gap (50% Fib of fall from 1.3200 to 1.1412) before topping out and recoiling to sub-1.2200 levels when news broke that UK PM Johnson has contracted the coronavirus, and then rebounding beyond 1.2400 when the Buck came under pressure again and stops were triggered through a series of upside tech levels (including the 21 DMA). For the record, normally top tier data in the form of CPI and retail sales (at the new earlier 7.00GMT ONS release time) was largely shrugged off, along with preliminary PMIs even though the surveys were bleak overall and the BoE flagged their importance after previously playing down the role of the findings in terms of policy deliberations. On that note, the scheduled March MPC meeting passed without much fanfare as rates and APF were left as is following the 2 emergency eases and new QE tranche earlier this month.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aside from losing the tag of cash king due in no small part to the Fed expanding and enhancing swap lines, the Dollar was undermined by a staggering jump in US initial claims that completely blitzed the prior all time apex, at almost 3.3 mn. Moreover, there is a reasonable and rational thesis, rather than conspiratorial, the number could have been even higher if all applications lodged were processed instead of agency staff ploughing through as many as possible due to the overload.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Although Italy has become the new COVID-19 epicentre and Spain’s confirmed case/fatality count seems to be catching up, the single currency remains on track to net gains vs the Buck within a wide 1.1086-1.0638 range. However, the single currency has weakened independently, between 0.8940-0.9390 against the Pound and 1.0653-1.0531 vs the Franc amidst uncertainty and ongoing bickering over a coordinated fiscal response to the virus from Eurozone Governments, including the use of OMTs to supplement ECB efforts like the QE envelope and PEPP that kicked in this week.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>Swiss bank sight deposits continue to rise, while the Government and SNB have injected more forms of liquidity and credit, but the even more highly valued Franc is still appreciating with Usd/Chf eyeing a new base near 0.9555 compared to almost 0.9900 at the other end of the spectrum.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Very volatile weeks and a somewhat contrasting final trading session for the non-US Dollars, as the Antipodes mostly danced to the risk sentiment tune that changed tone several times, though also moved in lock-step with other G10 peers inversely to their US counterpart. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are ending near or at fresh peaks around 0.6134 and 0.6029 respectively, but Usd/Cad has bounced from sub-1.4000 in wake of the BoC’s 3rd impromptu 50 bp rate cut that came with QE and a Fed-style commercial paper buying vehicle given that conventional policy has now reached the lower bound. Nevertheless, Governor Poloz did not rule out NIRP altogether and the Loonie is still off worst levels vs its US rival circa 1.4560.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Also victims and sometimes criminals over the course of yet another manic, frantic and often fickle 5 days in FX land, but the Scandi Crowns have fared well on technical grounds irrespective of crude’s latest capitulation that normally undermines the Nok in particular, and the spectre of Norges Bank intervention continues to impact. Conversely, the Rub has been hit hard by Brent’s sharp retreat from recent recovery highs and no sign of Russia or Saudi Arabia settling the dispute over prices and share of the dwindling spoils. Meanwhile, the spread of nCoV is taking an increasing and wider toll to the extent that the BCB may now be on the brink of buying bonds and SA is in grave danger of losing its last non-junk ratings standing when Moody’s delivers its long awaited review.</p>",

US indices finished up around 6%, with the Dow seeing its strongest three day run since 1931 and re-entering a bull-market, while the S&amp;P had its best three-day performance since 1933. Gains were led by defensive sectors (utilities, telecoms, health care). Equities shrugged-off the highest weekly jobless claims print on record.

US equity futures opened firmer, though subsequently gave up gains, and are trading lower, albeit off worst levels. <strong>ASX 200 (-5.3%)</strong> was led lower by its heavyweight financial and mining sectors, while the <strong>Nikkei 225 (+3.8%)</strong> shrugged off a firmer JPY, with some optimism in the country emanating from Japanese Economy Minister Nishimura who stated that there was no need to declare a state of emergency over the outbreak. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.6%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp.

US equity futures follow suit from Europe with losses currently tallying to around 2% per index – with eyes State-side on the virus bill which is poised to make its passage through the House later today. Back to Europe, UK’s FTSE 100 (-3.9%) underperforms the region with a number of its stocks at the foot of the Stoxx 600 index as caution arises from the prospect of delayed UK/EU FTA negotiations, despite the already-tight schedule – whilst housing and banks names also see headwinds from the UK govt calling for the halt of home purchases/sales.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Italy’s FTSE MIB (-2.3%) continues to feel some support from the ECB dismissing the 33% issuer limit for its emergency program purchases. European sectors reside largely in the red but reflect risk aversion, whilst underperformance is seen in the Energy sector on account of the downside in Brent prices. The sector breakdown meanwhile sees Travel &amp; Leisure pressured on the ongoing virus-induced demand woes for the sector.

Both theories appear credible and are backed up by price developments given the DXY’s subsequent recovery to 99.500+ and the so called fear gauge climbing to 67 from around 61 at settlement on Thursday.

Similarly, the Euro topped out ahead of 1.1100 and is waning on the ongoing spread of pandemic cases and fatalities across the common currency community, with particular focus on Italy and Spain. However, decent option expiries at the 1.1000 strike (1 bn) may provide a buffer for Eur/Usd.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback has regained an element of composure after yesterday’s slide and extended losses across the board, with some analysts suggesting that the <strong>DXY </strong>eventually<strong> </strong>found technical respite in the form of Fib support around 98.840 and others noting that the index is correlating quite well with moves in the VIX. Both theories appear credible and are backed up by price developments given the DXY’s subsequent recovery to 99.500+ and the so called fear gauge climbing to 67 from around 61 at settlement on Thursday. Certainly, traditional fundamentals and data do not seem to be driving sentiment or direction as the focus remains firmly on COVID-19 amidst the backdrop of swings in global stock markets and risk assets vs safe-havens.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/AUD</strong></p><p>Bucking the overall trend, or resisting the broad Dollar revival to be more precise, as the Yen retains its renowned safe-haven allure above 109.00, while Sterling appears to have formed another higher platform on the 1.2100 handle to probe above 1.2300 and match a key chart resistance level (50% retracement of reversal from 1.3200 to 1.1412), albeit with the aid of Eur/Gbp tailwinds as the cross recoils from almost 0.9100 to sub-0.9000, with month/quarter end positioning cited on top of possible official Pound buying interest. Elsewhere, the Aussie is holding up relatively well and again month-end demand has been touted alongside exporter bids, leverage stops and momentum accounts joining the break of 0.6100 to the overnight highs.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/NZD/CHF</strong></p><p>The Loonie is underperforming after failing to sustain momentum through 1.4000 and record low Canadian crude prices may be weighing along with contagion from the coronavirus after the huge spike in US weekly claims that is expected to be evident in domestic data given reports that 500k people applied for benefits last week. Similarly, the Euro topped out ahead of 1.1100 and is waning on the ongoing spread of pandemic cases and fatalities across the common currency community, with particular focus on Italy and Spain. However, decent option expiries at the 1.1000 strike (1 bn) may provide a buffer for Eur/Usd. In contrast, the Franc and Kiwi are both rangebound within 0.9645-0.9587 and 0.6126-0.5921 respective bands.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Broad retracements as the Usd consolidates off its lows, but the Zar also conceding ground in the run up to Moody’s SA ratings review that could well see the sovereign lose its last non-junk standing. Note also, the Rand has been ruffled by the first COVID-19 deaths as the country starts a 3 week lockdown.</p>",

However, as the European day comes into focus, the picture is mixed, as Aussie shares turned negative, and other bourses off highs. US indices finished up around 6%, with the Dow seeing its strongest three day run since 1931 and re-entering a bull-market, while the S&amp;P had its best three-day performance since 1933. Gains were led by defensive sectors (utilities, telecoms, health care). Equities shrugged-off the highest weekly jobless claims print on record. Airlines rose as they stand to benefit from the government's virus relief package, which was the most cited reason for gains on Thursday. Some desks also noted that month/quarter-end rebalancing will see 850bln of flows into equities. US equity futures opened firmer, though have subsequently given up gains, and are trading over 1% in the red. ASX 200 (-4.6%) was led lower by its heavyweight financial and mining sectors, while the Nikkei 225 (+2.0%) shrugged off a firmer JPY, with some optimism in the country emanating from Japanese Economy Minister Nishimura who stated that there was no need to declare a state of emergency over the outbreak. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) remained in positive territory and were buoyed by increased efforts from Chinese officials to stem a substantial second wave of the virus in the country, with reports yesterday noting that airport tests will be ramped up for people arriving from abroad.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>Banking Names</strong> – Former Chairman of the Independent Commission on Banking has called on the BoE to block the over GBP 7.5bln worth of dividends which banks are due to pay.

US indices finished up around 6%, with the Dow seeing its strongest three day run since 1931 and re-entering a bull-market, while the S&amp;P had its best three-day performance since 1933. Gains were led by defensive sectors (utilities, telecoms, health care). Equities shrugged-off the highest weekly jobless claims print on record. Some desks also noted that month/quarter-end rebalancing will see 850bln of flows into equities. US equity futures opened firmer, though subsequently gave up gains, and are trading lower, albeit off worst levels. <strong>ASX 200 (-4.6%)</strong> was led lower by its heavyweight financial and mining sectors, while the <strong>Nikkei 225 (+2.0%)</strong> shrugged off a firmer JPY, with some optimism in the country emanating from Japanese Economy Minister Nishimura who stated that there was no need to declare a state of emergency over the outbreak. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+1.0%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp.

He added that the RBI's response must involve conventional and unconventional measures. Das noted that inflation was running higher than projections in January and February, and that aggregate demand may weaken, and ease inflation further due to Covid-19. Das also said projections for growth and inflation will be dependent on how Covid progresses; he noted that uncertainties in the outlook and explained that is why the MPC has refrained from providing growth and inflation forecasts. <strong>Das also announced targeted long-term repo operations, offering up to INR 1trln.</strong></p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p><strong>UK Chancellor Sunak announced support for the self-employed; will pay self-employed taxable grant of 80% of average monthly profits of the last three years.

Policymaker support has added Dollars into the system, and accordingly cross currency basis has eased, which has seen the <strong>JPY</strong> continue to advance despite a constructive risk environment, where stocks were mostly higher. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> gave up the 109.00 level and remained around session lows as European players enter the market. Risk sensitive FX are firmer, accordingly (AUD, NZD, CAD, GBP); particularly the <strong>Aussie</strong>, which vaulted 0.61, as officials plan a third tranche of economic aid. <strong>AUD/USD</strong> meandered near session highs and around the 0.6100 handle following the announcement. <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> benefitted from the <strong>DXY’s</strong> pullback towards 99.000, with the pairs having stabilised around 1.1050 and 1.2250 respectively heading into the European open.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>After settling lower on Thursday, crude futures were up in Asia trade, although it has generally respected the week's range. Concerns on the demand-side of the crude equation kept oil defensive on Thursday, while concerns of rising supply are also playing a role, amid the Russia/Saudi price war. <strong>WTI</strong> underperformed its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart, with analysts suggesting it was a result of US refiners cutting back refinery runs amid falling consumption of products. Additionally, the US coronavirus relief bill had not set aside funds for the Energy Department to \"fill up the SPR\", as per President Trump's wishes; the DOE itself said it had funds for potential oil purchases for the SPR, and was working with Congress on the details. Meanwhile, a letter emerged revealing US lawmakers had urged Secretary of State Pompeo to call on ally Saudi Arabia to change its course on oil prices, which is threatening the US economy. Pompeo should encourage both Riyadh and Moscow to stop wreaking havoc in global markets—particularly as the US seeks to address a growing pandemic and avert an economic crisis. The lawmakers called on Saudi Arabia to partner with the United States on strategic energy infrastructure projects across the Indo-Pacific region and in the Americas. If the Saudis turned down US offers, the lawmakers called for various types of aid and assistance to be pulled.

        "subject": "APAC MACRO WRAP: Stocks move higher, dollar lower; RBI emergency cut",
        "content": "<p><strong>* ASIA MARKET WRAP: </strong>The week is closing out on a quiet note in Asia, with little by way of fresh news flow to change recent narratives. Asian bourses started off on the front foot, taking their lead from a third consecutive day of gains on Wall Street, though some regions struggled to sustain gains. US equity futures re-opened mixed, but have ultimately gave up gains, and is languishing as the Europeans arrive. The dollar continued to ease, amid more favourable funding conditions and weak labour market data Thursday. The dollar's downside gave impetus to the JPY which fell through a long-term fib level around 108.60. Quiet, mildly risk on conditions also helped the Aussie to gain for a sixth session, taking it above the 50% retracement level of the March decline. Treasury trade was largely horizontal, with 10-year yields straddling 0.80%. Data did little to move the dial; China industrial profits contracted by the most on record (-38.3% Y/Y - markets had always expected a grim outcome), while Tokyo CPI was in line with expectations. Ahead, the focus will be on Capitol Hill, where the US House is expected to (eventually) advance the coronavirus relief bill.</p><p><strong>* EQUITIES: </strong>Major APAC indices initially took their cues from Wall Street, rising firmly at the open, amid optimism that policymakers will continue to roll-out stimulus measures to guard economies against covid-induced downside. However, as the European day comes into focus, the picture is mixed, with Aussie shares now negative, and other bourses off highs. US indices finished up around 6%, with the Dow seeing its strongest three day run since 1931 and re-entering a bull-market, while the S&amp;P had its best three-day performance since 1933. Gains were led by defensive sectors (utilities, telecoms, health care). Equities shrugged-off the highest weekly jobless claims print on record. Airlines rose as they stand to benefit from the government's virus relief package, which was the most cited reason for gains on Thursday. Some desks also noted that month/quarter-end rebalancing will see 850bln of flows into equities. US equity futures opened firmer, though have subsequently given up gains, and are trading over 1% in the red. Spread bettors are calling</p><p><strong>* FX: </strong>The DXY edged further lower in Asia trade, having relinquished the 100.00 level in US hours, amid record high jobless claims. Policymaker support has added dollars into the system, and accordingly cross currency basis has eased, which has seen the yen continue to advance despite a constructive risk environment, where stocks are higher. Risk sensitive FX is higher, accordingly (AUD, NZD, CAD, GBP); particularly the Aussie, which vaulted 0.61, as officials plan a third tranche of economic aid.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>After settling lower on Thursday, crude futures are up in Asia trade, although it has generally respected the week's range. Concerns on the demand-side of the crude equation kept oil defensive on Thursday, while concerns of rising supply are also playing a role, amid the Russia/Saudi price war. WTI underperformed its Brent counterpart, with analysts suggesting it was a result of US refiners cutting back refinery runs amid falling consumption of products. Additionally, the US coronavirus relief bill had not set aside funds for the Energy Department to \"fill up the SPR\", as per President Trump's wishes; the DOE itself said it had funds for potential oil purchases for the SPR, and was working with Congress on the details. Meanwhile, a letter emerged revealing US lawmakers had urged Secretary of State Pompeo to call on ally Saudi Arabia to change its course on oil prices, which is threatening the US economy. Pompeo should encourage both Riyadh and Moscow to stop wreaking havoc in global markets—particularly as the US seeks to address a growing pandemic and avert an economic crisis. The lawmakers called on Saudi Arabia to partner with the United States on strategic energy infrastructure projects across the Indo-Pacific region and in the Americas. If the Saudis turned down US offers, the lawmakers called for various types of aid and assistance to be pulled. Elsewhere, Saudi-led coalition says it intercepted and destroyed missiles fired by Yemeni Houthis, according to Saudi state news.</p><p><strong>* G20: </strong>France President Macron says he and US President Trump were preparing \"a strong new initiative\" with other nations, which will be unveiled in the coming days. Earlier, reports had suggested that G20 leaders are to inject USD 5trln into the global economy to combat covid; leaders have committed to do 'whatever it takes' to overcome the pandemic, pledging to implement and fund all health measures necessary. Analysts also noted that the tone of language on trade was softer than recent statements, though stopped short of calling for an end to export bans on medical supplies. Elsewhere, US President Trump said it looks like the US can do another trade deal with China, though it will have to wait until after the Presidential election. Separately, US President Trump and China President Xi were said to have held a phone call overnight; details are yet to emerge.</p><p><strong>* US FISCAL ACTION: </strong>The House has set a two-hour debate on coronavirus relief bill on Friday 0900 ET/1300 GMT, according to House officials. The Bill may not be able to pass via voice vote, and it was unclear on the timings of the next step, like a roll-call vote, the House Majority Leader's office said. Democrats may ask for a recorded vote, which may delay the passing of the bill. Analysts generally expect the Bill will (eventually) pass. Elsewhere, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers have urged the Trump administration to defer all tariffs during the covid pandemic, for at least a 90-day period, or until the crisis has passed.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS CASES: </strong>The CDC Thursday reported the COVID-19 case count in the US was up to 68,440 from 54,453 on Wednesday, and deaths had risen to 994 from 737; however, a Reuters calculation suggests that cases are currently around 81,378, which would be above China and Italy's numbers. US President Trump said he will early next week provide information on relaxing guidelines on social distancing. Mainland China reported 55 new virus cases (vs 67 on Thursday); the total case count&nbsp; rose to 81,340 as of end-26th March; 5 new deaths were reported in the period (vs 6 on Thursday). No new cases were reported in the&nbsp; Hubei province (total 67,801), though 5 new deaths reported (total 3,174).</p><p><strong>* EUROPEAN MEASURES: </strong>European leaders were unable to agree on a strategy to drag their economies through the virus crisis. Italy reportedly rejected a draft prepared by aides, and urged leaders to come up with more solutions. Italy said leaders have 10 days to find an adequate solution to the emergency, and have tasked finance ministers to work out details of ESM credit lines; while nations like Spain and Italy have called for the creation of a joint-debt instrument, nations like Austria, Netherlands and Finland have leaned against those calls.</p><p><strong>* SINGAPORE: </strong>Officials unveiled a SGD 48bln stimulus package, which will add to February’s SGD 6.4bln budget. Taken together, Singapore’s fiscal response to the economy slipping into recession amounts to a sizable 11% of GDP, UOB's analysts noted; the Monetary Authority of Singapore will announce its policy decision on Monday, and loosening of policy is virtually a foregone conclusion given that the country is heading into recession, UOB argues.</p><p><strong>* RBI: </strong>RBI Governor Das confirmed the MPC held an emergency meeting this week, where it voted 4-2 to cut its main rate by 75bps to 4.40%; the reverse repo rate was cut to 4.15%. Governor Das said the move was designed to mitigate effects of the virus, revive growth and preserve financial stability. He added that the RBI's response must involve conventional and unconventional measures. Das noted that inflation was running higher than projections in January and February, and that aggregate demand may weaken, and ease inflation further due to Covid-19. Das also said projections for growth and inflation will be dependent on how Covid progresses; he noted that uncertainties in the outlook, and explained that is why the MPC has refrained from providing growth and inflation forecasts. Das also announced targeted long-term repo operations, offering up to INR 1trln.</p><p><strong>* UK STIMULUS: </strong>Chancellor Sunak announced measures aimed at reassuring self-employed Britons, and will pay 80% of average monthly trading profit over the last three years, capped at GBP 2.5k/month.</p><p><strong>* FITCH AFFIRMS US: </strong>Fitch Ratings affirmed the US at 'AAA', outlook stable. Ratings are supported by structural strengths. Fitch considers US debt tolerance to be higher than that of other 'AAA' sovereigns, though noted that high fiscal deficits and debt were starting to erode credit strengths. Fitch warned that the risk of a near-term negative rating action had risen given the magnitude of the shock to the economy and public finances from the coronavirus and the commensurate and necessary fiscal policy response, particularly in the absence of a credible consolidation plan for the country's pre-existing government debt challenges. Fitch believes the US economy will shrink by around 3% in 2020 (although this could be subject to further revision).

He added that the RBI's response must involve conventional and unconventional measures. Das noted that inflation was running higher than projections in January and February, and that aggregate demand may weaken, and ease inflation further due to Covid-19. Das also said projections for growth and inflation will be dependent on how Covid progresses; he noted that uncertainties in the outlook, and explained that is why the MPC has refrained from providing growth and inflation forecasts. Das also announced targetted long-term repo operations, offering up to INR 1trln.</p>",

        "subject": "APAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia equities open higher, US stock futures ease; DXY horizontal, JPY continues its advance",
        "content": "<p>* EQUITIES: Major APAC indicies took their cues from Wall Street, rising firmly at the open, and on course for their best week in nine years, amid optimism that policymakers will continue to roll-out stimulus measures to guard economies against covid-induced downside. US indices finished up around 6%, with the Dow seeing its strongest three day run since 1931 and re-entering a bull-market, while the S&amp;P had its best three-day performance since 1933. Gains were led by defensive sectors (utilities, telecoms, health care). Equities shrugged-off the highest weekly jobless claims print on record. Airlines rose as they stand to benefit from the government's virus relief package, which was the most cited reason for gains on Thursday. Some desks also noted that month/quarter-end rebalancing will see 850bln flow into equities. US equity futures opened firmer, and after a slight wobble, continued their march higher, but have subsequently given up gains in recent trade, and the ES (M20) now trades with losses above 1%.</p><p>* FX: The DXY is starting the Asia day horizontally, having relinquished the 100.00 level in US trade, amid record high jobless claims. Policymaker support has added dollars into the system, and accordingly cross currency basis has eased, which has seen the JPY continue to advance despite a constructive risk environment, where stocks are higher. Risk sensitive FX is firmer accordingly (AUD, NZD, CAD, GBP). PBOC fixed the yuan midpoint at 7.0427 (prev. 7.0692); earlier, models had suggested 7.035-7.04, and skipped OMOs.</p><p>* US VIRUS CASES: The CDC Thursday reported the COVID-19 case count in the US was up to 68,440 from 54,453 on Wednesday, and deaths had risen to 994 from 737; however, a Reuters calculation suggests that cases are currently around 81,378, which would be above China and Italy's numbers. US President Trump said he will early next week provide information on relaxing guidelines on social distancing</p><p>* CHINA VIRUS CASES: China mainland reports 55 new virus cases (vs 67 on Thursday); total case count&nbsp; 81,340 as of end-26th March; 5 new deaths in the period (vs 6 reported on Thursday). No new cases were reported in the&nbsp; Hubei province (total 67,801), though 5 new deaths reported (total 3,174). To help stem the flow of the virus, China earlier announced it was banning entry by almost all foreigners. Outlets reported that Beijing had halted most international flights, and blocked even foreigners with Chinese residency or visas from entering.</p><p>* HOUSE VOTE: The House has set a two-hour debate on coronavirus relief bill on Friday 0900 ET/1300 GMT, according to House officials. The Bill may not be able to pass via voice vote, and it was unclear on the timings of the next step, like a roll-call vote, the House Majority Leader's office said. Democrats may ask for a recorded vote, which may delay the passing of the bill. Analysts generally expect the Bill will (eventually) pass.</p><p>* G20: France President Macron says he and US President Trump were preparing \"a strong new initiative\" with other nations, which will be unveiled in the coming days. Earlier, reports had suggested that G20 leaders are to inject USD 5trln into the global economy to combat covid; leaders have committed to do 'whatever it takes' to overcome the pandemic, pledging to implement and fund all health measures necessary. Analysts also noted that the tone of language on trade was softer than recent statements, though stopped short of calling for an end to export bans on medical supplies. Elsewhere, US President Trump said it looks like the US can do another trade deal with China, though it will have to wait until after the Presidential election.</p><p>* CHIP NAMES (TSM, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC) - US is moving forward with plans to limit chips to Huawei, according to sources cited by the WSJ. The proposal would require export licenses for many of the chips that are sold to Huawei that are made by US manufacturers; under the proposals, Commerce Dept could block sales of semis to TSMC. The measures would disadvantage US companies that produce semi equipment used by TSMC (could include AMAT, LRCX and KLAC). The rule will need writing, which could take weeks, sources said.</p>",
