        "content": "<p>The RBA are to release the minutes from the February meeting where the central bank held the Cash Rate Target at the record low of 1.50%. This was in-line with consensus as ASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures had indicated a 100% expectation the central bank would keep policy unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting, the RBA reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy and repeated that progress on inflation and unemployment is expected to be gradual. The RBA said it sees gradual inflation pick up over next couple of years, while its central scenario for GDP growth is to average around 3% this year and to slow in 2020 (Prev. said expects GDP to average 3.5% over 2 years).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guide, AUD/USD saw mild support as the announcement was interpreted as less dovish than some had expected as the central bank mostly stuck with its usual rhetoric despite the recent slew of less than satisfactory data releases and shifting expectations RBA could cut this year. However, RBA Governor Lowe gave a speech a day after the meeting where he provided a dovish shift regarding the outlook on rates as he stated the interest rate outlook is more evenly balanced which is in contrast with the central bank&rsquo;s previously held view of the next move likely to be up.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Home Secretary Javid urged for EU counterparts to be prepared for the discontinuation of current joint policing systems from March 30th in the event of a no-deal Brexit, while he added that no-deal is in place regarding extradition, data sharing and arrest warrants. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission President Juncker said if UK requested extension of talks, no one in Europe would oppose it while he added he has no timeframe for length of extension. In other news, Juncker said President Trump gave his word there wouldn&#39;t be tariffs on European cars for the time being and that if President Trump were to go back on promise of no tariffs on European cars, the EU would no longer feel bound to buy US soya beans and LNG. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet said TLTROs have been very useful tool to deal with impairments in the transmission of monetary policy and are part of the toolbox, while he added that they need to monitor transmission of monetary policy through the banking system carefully. Praet also commented that guidance on rates could be adapted which could be complemented by other measures if Euro area growth were to slow more sharply, but also stated further asset purchases may not be necessary to maintain appropriate financial conditions.

Thus, both FX crosses have reverted to trade essentially unchanged from levels seen in the late European morning, with little in the way of scheduled event risk ahead. GBP saw some early morning support from reports that some EU member states may be willing to accept a 5 year limit on the contingency arrangement, and was essentially unreactive to comments from EU&#39;s Barnier, who is reportedly open to the principle of the customs union should the UK want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CHF - Next up in the rankings during a lacklustre trading session, with the antipodeans still benefitting from positive updates out of the US/China trade deliberations. On a technical standpoint, the AUDUSD is testing its 100DMA of 0.7160 to the upside with the 0.6910 6th February high level eyed up next for the NZD should the key 0.6900 level be broken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - USDJPY continues to advance towards the top of its 110.40-60 range as the latest updates from US-China offering some support to the FX cross, and little by the way of technical indicators to point to ahead of the February 14th high of 111.13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/USD - The Loonie remains underpinned by higher oil prices and has marginally extended downside below 1.3250, with USDCAD trading with losses around a 10th of a percent as markets in the North American country are closed for Family Day. The DXY is also languishing in the red, with traders eyeing the Wednesday 13th low level of 96.60 to the downside this Presidents Day (with US markets also shut).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The TRY remains close to the top of todays 5.2720-5.3161 range after the 100bp cut in RRR over the weekend, with some suggesting that this will come ahead of potential CBRT rate cuts, going against the central banks rhetoric of a keeping tight monetary policy until inflation cools more.</p>\r\n",

The DAX (-0.1%) is mildly underperforming weighed on by auto names, Volkswagen (-1.1%) and Daimler (-0.7%), following China car sales falling 17.7% Y/Y; alongside the US Commerce Department submitting the &lsquo;Section 232&rsquo; report to US President Trump yesterday. The report is expected to include some tariffs on fully assembled vehicles, with the President having 90 days to act upon its recommendations; although ING have downplayed the potential impact of tariffs as the car industry adds at most 4% to German GDP, with an eighth of this depending on exports to the US. Subsequently, sectors are mixed with underperformance in the auto sector. Other notable movers include Wirecard (+12.5%) who are leading the Stoxx 600 after German financial regulator Bafin has issued a ban on establishing/increasing short positions on the Co. until April 18th. Separately, Reckitt Benckiser (+5.0%) are in the green following their earnings. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after being downgraded are Casino (-2.7%), who were downgraded to hold at Deutsche Bank.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Pretty level pegging at the top of the G10 leaderboard, as Sterling and the single currency glean most from a broader Dollar pull-back with the DXY retreating a bit further from 97.000 and last Friday&rsquo;s new 2019 high just shy of 97.400. The Pound has also benefited to a limited extent from reports that certain EU countries, including France, may be willing to provide legally binding assurances over the Irish backstop amidst speculation that pro-Brexiters may accept a 5 year limit on the contingency arrangement. Cable is back above 1.2900, but may find a more pronounced rebound tough to achieve without confirmation of any such olive branch and with almost 1 bn option expiries running off at the big figure. Similarly, Eur/Usd looks top heavy on the 1.1300 handle having faded at 1.1325 and now testing a Fib level around 1.1313.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/NZD - The next best majors, with the Franc paring more losses from last week&rsquo;s &lsquo;flash crash&rsquo; lows vs the aforementioned softer Greenback, but still pivoting 1.1350 against the Eur, while the antipodeans are relishing latest updates from China and the US as both sides declare progress on key trade issues. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both off overnight highs, but the former is holding closer to its peak circa 0.7160 vs the latter that waned just ahead of 0.6900, as the cross trade back over 1.0400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY - Firm oil prices still underpinning the Loonie that is pivoting 1.3250 in holiday-thinned trade (US and Canadian markets closed, latter for Family Day), while Usd/Jpy has firmed off recent lows on US-China tariff optimism and ahead of mega option expiry interest at the 110.00 strike (2.5 bn) within a relatively restricted 110.40-60 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira is markedly underperforming after the CBRT&rsquo;s 100 bp RRR reduction over the weekend, as concerns about a more formal shift in policy via benchmark rates to an easier stance build. Usd/Try climbed from the low 5.2700s to 5.3150+ at one stage compared to regional counterparts that are treading water vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have seen a bit more price action, albeit relatively speaking compared to Gilts as turnover and conviction are still somewhat lacking. However, the 10 German bond has widened its trading parameters on both sides, with a marginal new intraday Eurex low just seen at 166.31 following a relatively measured recovery to a fresh session peak at 166.55 as the Dax and other EU bourses frittered away early gains and a bit more. Note, Bunds may pick up some underlying technical bids if support around 166.28-26 holds, while a more pronounced rebound could be thwarted again unless last Friday&rsquo;s best (166.64) is breached. Back to Liffe, Gilts have also slipped back from a new high at&nbsp; 124.20 and nearest resistance also aligns with the previous session pinnacle, at 124.30 vs support at Friday&rsquo;s 123.97 base. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are understandably muted, though nearer the bottom of constrained overnight ranges and with the curve fractionally steeper in the absence of cash markets on Presidents Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+0.1%) futures are consolidating following Friday&rsquo;s advances after the benchmarks printed fresh YTD highs. Prices are supported by the OPEC-led supply curbs, US sanctions on Venezuela and Iran and optimism surrounding a US-Sino trade deal, while US President Trump also acknowledged progress and productivity in talks over the weekend. Furthermore, US National Security Advisor Bolton, on twitter, warned the international oil company to not deal with Venezuelan state-owned PDVSA due to sanctions, calling the company &ldquo;Maduro&rsquo;s corrupt oil slush fund&rdquo;. Elsewhere on the radar, Nigerian elections have been rescheduled to the 23rd February as the INEC said it had deemed holding the poll &ldquo;no longer feasible&rdquo;. In terms of potential market impact, a group of militants from the Delta region threatened to resume attacks against oil pipelines and facilities if the trial against Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen (whose role includes overseeing potential election disputes) proceeds, due to corruption allegations. Oil traders will recall the 2016 attacks from the Niger Delta militants which significantly disrupted Nigerian output, which was running at a rate of 1.89mln BPD in December. PMV analysts said that the latest provides &quot;a timely reminder that Nigerian authorities have yet to conclusively eliminate the threat posed by armed militants&quot;. Looking at production, the country&rsquo;s crude output declined to 1.66mln BPD in December from 1.78mln in December; according to the oil ministry. Finally, as a reminder, WTI will not settle tonight due to US President&rsquo;s Day holiday so prices may diverge from the global benchmark come tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, spot gold (+0.3%) is largely dominated by USD actions and treads water above the 1320/oz handle as the DXY retreated below 97.000, while copper remains underpinned on sentiment regarding US-China trade talks. Finally, Chinese rebar steel has snapped a four-day losing streak, buoyed by demand expectations as mills restock on iron ore.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty level pegging at the top of the G10 leaderboard, as Sterling and the single currency glean most from a broader Dollar pull-back with the DXY retreating a bit further from 97.000 and last Friday&rsquo;s new 2019 high just shy of 97.400. The Pound has also benefited to a limited extent from reports that certain EU countries, including France, may be willing to provide legally binding assurances over the Irish backstop amidst speculation that pro-Brexiters may accept a 5 year limit on the contingency arrangement. Cable is back above 1.2900, but may find a more pronounced rebound tough to achieve without confirmation of any such olive branch and with almost 1 bn option expiries running off at the big figure. Similarly, Eur/Usd looks top heavy on the 1.1300 handle having faded at 1.1325 and now testing a Fib level around 1.1313.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors, with the Franc paring more losses from last week&rsquo;s &lsquo;flash crash&rsquo; lows vs the aforementioned softer Greenback, but still pivoting 1.1350 against the Eur, while the antipodeans are relishing latest updates from China and the US as both sides declare progress on key trade issues. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both off overnight highs, but the former is holding closer to its peak circa 0.7160 vs the latter that waned just ahead of 0.6900, as the cross trade back over 1.0400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firm oil prices still underpinning the Loonie that is pivoting 1.3250 in holiday-thinned trade (US and Canadian markets closed, latter for Family Day), while Usd/Jpy has firmed off recent lows on US-China tariff optimism and ahead of mega option expiry interest at the 110.00 strike (2.5 bn) within a relatively restricted 110.40-60 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira is markedly underperforming after the CBRT&rsquo;s 100 bp RRR reduction over the weekend, as concerns about a more formal shift in policy via benchmark rates to an easier stance build. Usd/Try climbed from the low 5.2700s to 5.3150+ at one stage compared to regional counterparts that are treading water vs the Usd.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) is led higher by outperformance in the energy sector after oil prices rose 2.5% on Friday to hit fresh YTD highs but with gains in the index contained by a lacklustre energy sector, while the Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) is the biggest gainer as exporters get a boost from a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.7%) also benefit from the trade-related optimism after US-China trade talks were extended into this week, while the latest lending data also provides encouragement as both Aggregate Financing and New Yuan Loans topped estimates in which the latter rose by the most on record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is subdued following its recent pullback to beneath the 97.00 level and with US participants on an extended weekend due to President&rsquo;s Day, while its major counterparts extend on recent gains in which EUR/USD and GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively. Elsewhere, antipodeans are firmer due to the lacklustre greenback, heightened risk appetite and recent gains across the commodities complex, while the broad positive sentiment has also underpinned JPY-crosses although USD/JPY has somewhat stalled amid USD-woes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher despite the heightened risk appetite across the region, with prices supported by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of government bonds and after weak Machine Orders data which has prompted the government to downgrade its relevant assessment.</p>\r\n",
