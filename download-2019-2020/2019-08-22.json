Furthermore, an official in Macron's office said talks between the French President and UK PM were constructive in which they agreed to continue exchanges until end of September to try and reach an agreement on Brexit.

There were also comments from a senior German official that Chancellor Merkel was being polite in reference to her 30-day remark and those who know Merkel say she concludes \"the train has already left the station\" and it is almost impossible to stop a no deal Brexit. (Newswires/AFP)</p><p>ECB Minutes stated the slowdown is more protracted than previously thought and downside risks are more pervasive which could necessitate projection cut. Furthermore, members widely shared the view that the recent declines in longer-term inflation expectations were a matter of concern and that incoming data had been broadly in line with the June projections although a mechanical update of the short-term HICP outlook suggested a somewhat lower path. Members also broadly supported the proposal made by Chief Economist Lane to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options for future policy measures, although some concerns were raised regarding possible unintended consequences of a tiered system and its ability to fully mitigate the potential effects of negative policy rates on bank intermediation.

Following slightly hawkish Fed minutes on Wednesday, another wave of hawkish Fed commentary out of Jackson Hole kept risk assets on the defensive in early US trade. Additionally, PMI data saw the manufacturing segment fall into contraction, adding to the gloom. However, equities were supported in afternoon trade, with some suggesting that China purchases of US soybeans was a bullish sign, and attributed the news for helping stocks rise off lows and claw back earlier losses. Attention now falls onto the address of Fed Chair Powell at Jackson Hole (1500 BST/1000 EDT on Friday). Boeing (BA) traded higher after both Moody’s and Cowen cheered the return of the MAX jet by Q4. BA was also boosted after sourced reports that it has plans to increase production of 737 jets to 52/month in February 2020, if regulators approve the 737 MAX jet to fly in Q4. Nordstrom (JWN) was flirting with its largest percentage increase in over a decade following a strong profit beat; EPS 0.90 (Exp. 0.76), the stock was up over 15% despite missing on revenue. L Brands (LB), however were hit on earnings, with revenues falling short of expectations; it also reported SSS decline of 1%. Keysight (KEYS) and Synopsis (SNPS) were also higher after earnings beats. Tesla (TSLA) was in focus after reports in Manager Magazin that it is preparing for a takeover offer from Volkswagen (VOW3), though VW denied the claim. Meanwhile, Politico reported that EU officials want to set up a EUR 100bln wealth fund to bolster \"European champions\" against American and Chinese business rivals like Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY). In M&amp;A, State AG’s are reportedly trying to block the T-Mobile (TMUS) &amp; Sprint (S) doing a deep dive into Dish’s (DISH) financials and ability to compete as a fourth major wireless network. S&amp;P 500 0% at 2928, NASDAQ-100 -0.3% at 7723, Dow Jones 0.2% at 26300.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Major curve spreads were mixed at settlement, although +/- 1bps or so vs Wednesday’s settlement levels. There was a steepening bias in early trade, however, underpinned by the ‘hawkish’ FOMC meeting minutes. A little bit of indecision has been seen in Thursday trade, with traders questioning if Powell will be able to deliver on the market’s dovish expectations. In pre-market US trade, Treasuries moves in sympathy with Bunds. However, the focus was back on Fed officials after remarks from Fed’s hawkish voter (dissenter) George, as well as somewhat hawkish comments from the Fed’s Harker; the net impact of these was for risk assets to come under pressure. Focus now on Powell, with risks of a disappointment.&nbsp; US T-note futures (U9) settled 7+ ticks lower at 130-09+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Following slightly hawkish Fed minutes on Wednesday, another wave of hawkish Fed commentary out of Jackson Hole kept risk assets on the defensive in early US trade. Additionally, PMI data saw the manufacturing segment fall into contraction, adding to the gloom. However, equities were supported in afternoon trade, with some suggesting that China purchases of US soybeans was a bullish sign, and attributed the news for helping stocks rise off lows and claw back earlier losses. Attention now falls onto the address of Fed Chair Powell at Jackson Hole (1500 BST/1000 EDT on Friday).</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong>&nbsp;Following a slightly hawkish FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, Jackson Hole commentary from Fed officials has started off on a hawkish note.&nbsp;<strong>Fed’s George&nbsp;(voter, hawk, dissenter)</strong> said it was not the time for further accommodation. George said that the rate cut in July was not needed, and she was not open to providing more accommodation without signs the outlook is getting weaker. She believes rates are at an equilibrium, and would be happy to leave rates where they are now. George noted that the economy has absorbed the downside risks, and is poised to expand<strong>.&nbsp;Fed’s Harker&nbsp;(non-voter, neutral)</strong> said that based on the state of the US economy, the Fed is where it needs to be, and he does not see a case for further stimulus. Harker stated that he did not agree with the July rate cut, but went along with it to get rates back to neutral, but indicated that he would not endorse a rate cut in September. He argued, however, that if tariffs hit consumers, then it would be a cause for concern, which may lead to changing his view. <strong>Fed's Kaplan (non-voter, neutral)</strong> said he was in favour of the rate cut in July, but is taking time to assess all factors heading into the September FOMC, adding that he would like to avoid taking further action on rates, noting they can impact savers and encourage more risk-taking. On the economy, he sees growth around 2.0% this year, but with downside risks.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong>&nbsp;China purchased a small number of US soybeans between 9-15th August, following on from declarations to stop purchases of US farm products, sources said. However, the shipment was very small. China imported just under 10k tonnes between 9-15th August for delivery in the current marketing year, Reuters reported, and 66k tonnes (around one cargo) for the next year. China's MOFCOM 5th August said that Chinese companies had stopped buying US ags, and the purchases reported today were a little surprising. Elsewhere, Chinese MOFCOM said it will have to retaliate if US persists on current course, adding that any new measures will lead to escalation; it declined to comment on possible retaliatory measures, but said it would publish an unreliable entity list soon. It also added that the impact from US tariffs were manageable, and China is fully confident it can handle all challengers. Finally, MOFCOM noted that China/US trade teams have been keeping in touch.</p><p><strong>* US LEADING INDEX:</strong>&nbsp;at 0.5% M/M against an estimate for 0.3%. July's increase follows back-to-back modest declines, with housing permits, unemployment insurance claims, stock prices driving the improvement. However, the Conference Board said that the manufacturing sector continues show signs of weakness, and the yield spread was negative for a second consecutive month. \"While the LEI suggests the US economy will continue to expand in the second half of 2019, it is likely to do so at a moderate pace,\" the Conference Board added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US PMIs:</strong>&nbsp;Often ignored by US players, but moved the market today after the manufacturing component fell into contraction. August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter, Markit said, the PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualized GDP growth of around 1.5%. \"The most concerning aspect of the latest data is a slowdown in new business growth to its weakest in a decade, driven by a sharp loss of momentum across the service sector,\" Markit said, \"survey respondents commented on a headwind from subdued corporate spending as softer growth expectations at home and internationally encouraged tighter budget setting. The survey compiler also noted that manufacturing companies continued to feel the impact of slowing global economic conditions, with new export sales falling at the fastest pace since August 2009. \"Business expectations for the year ahead became gloomier in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012. The continued slide in corporate growth projections suggests that firms may exert greater caution in relation to spending, investment and staff hiring during the coming months.\" Analysts warn about reading too much into the data, however, since the Markit PMI for the US has mostly given an unreliable read of ISM in the last year.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE PMIs:</strong>&nbsp;Prelim August PMI moved slightly higher, against expectations of a small fall, though remains in its 51-52 range, which Pantheon Macroeconomics says is consistent with GDP growth of around 1.0%. There was an improvement in the manufacturing PMI, though it still remains in contractionary territory for the seventh straight month, which will likely add pressure on the ECB; services ticked up slightly. Pantheon thinks that the song remains the same, however: manufacturing is still suffering, but services—effectively the domestic economy—is still relatively robust, the consultancy says, noting that new orders and output growth in manufacturing remain soft, primarily due to weakness in Germany, which dragged employment in this sector down for the fourth month running. By contrast, Pantheon notes that the services sector is more robust. Meanwhile, the German composite and manufacturing ticked up, while the services saw a trivial fall. New orders are still edging lower, while work backlogs fell at the quickest pace since 2012.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong>&nbsp;UK PM Johnson’s meeting with French President Macron failed to yield any breakthrough (hardly a surprise), with both reiterating arguments that we have heard in recent days. Despite that, rhetoric was constructive. Germany Chancellor Merkel once again gave an sanguine set of comments on Brexit; however, Germany had to clarify her remarks (that a backstop alternative was possible within 30 days), adding that she was not setting the UK a deadline, but she said “that what one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30 days.”</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE CONSUMER SENTIMENT:</strong>&nbsp;August Eurozone consumer confidence fell to -7.1 from July’s -6.6 reading, a slight miss on the expected -7.0, and largely consistent with recent lacklustre household spending data. Capital Economics said that August’s reading is historically consistent with household spending growth of between 1.5% and 2.0%. However, it caveats that since 2017, the measure has overstated household spending growth, and add that other factors such as the collapse of Italy’s government, the increasing risk of a no-deal Brexit and signs of a slowing labour market; as such the consultancy expects household spending growth is running at a more conservative 1.5% Y/Y.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong>&nbsp;Italian President Mattarella says new elections is a choice that cannot be taken lightly; some parties he has spoken to said they are working towards a deal to create a coalition, but needed more time. Mattarella says new consultations will be held on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the PD party is willing to enter a coalition government with the 5SM. The PD’s willingness to reach an agreement with 5SM increases the chances that the two parties can form a coalition, which would avert the need for early elections. With that said, analysts note that the PD’s demand could still prove to be a source of friction since they are likely incompatible with the 5SM position. The PD’s offer seems to be premised on five conditions, including loyal membership of the EU, giving Parliament a central role, and a reversal of Lega’s anti-immigration policies. One of the sticking points for a coalition would then be who would become prime minister, the BBC reported, since neither PD leader Zingaretti nor 5SM leader Di-Maio have shown any interest in the job, leaving questions on who would lead the coalition. If the two parties fail to reach deal, autumn elections appear likely, which raises the possibility that the Lega will storm the vote, winning a majority – a scenario analysts have said could put pressure on Italian assets.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES:</strong>&nbsp;The July meeting minutes echoed concerns expressed by ECB President Draghi during his post-meeting press conference; policymakers view the slowdown as more protracted than previously thought, with downside risks more pervasive. Moreover, from an inflation perspective, declines in both actual and longer-term inflation expectations are framed as “a matter of concern.” As such, members “broadly supported the proposal made by Chief Economist Lane to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options for future policy measures”. In terms of the scope and sequencing of potential further measures, the accounts noted “experience had shown that a policy package – such as the combination of rate cuts and asset purchases – was more effective than a sequence of selective actions”, a viewpoint largely in-fitting with recent comments from Finland’s ECB member Rehn, who called for an “impactful and significant” easing package. However, as suggested by Draghi himself last month, concerns were raised regarding possible unintended consequences of tiered rates and its ability to mitigate the potential negative impact of negative rates on banks, implying that a tiered deposit rate system is not necessarily a given accompaniment to rate cuts and asset purchases. It is worth noting that the meeting took place before the Fed July rate cut, thus any prior concerns held by policymakers have likely been heightened with members likely more unanimous now in their desire to present a comprehensive easing package next month. ING looks for “a 20bp rate cut of the deposit rate, a small tiering system, a repricing of the TLTROs and a restart of QE with some 30 billion euro per month” at the September meeting.</p><p><strong>* S.KOREA/JAPAN:</strong>&nbsp;South Korea announced it would not be renewing its intelligence accord with Japan; in recent rhetoric, South Korea has been threatening to pull out of the pact, but Japan had maintained the view that it wanted to keep it intact. Japan's Foreign Minister Kono said later that it is extremely regrettable that South Korea has decided to end their intelligence agreement. The breakdown of the pact is a blow to the US, which has benefitted from the intelligence operation to gauge North Korea’s missile activity; North Korea on Thursday carried out live fire drills by bombing replicas of South Korea's F-15K fighter jets, surface to air missiles, and a radar.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong>&nbsp;Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said he is prepared to work on France's proposals regarding a nuclear deal; earlier Zarif reiterated that Iran will not start a war in the Persian Gulf but \"will defend ourselves”.

A little bit of indecision has been seen in Thursday trade, with traders questioning if Powell will be able to deliver on the market’s dovish expectations. In pre-market US trade, Treasuries moves in sympathy with Bunds. However, the focus was back on Fed officials after remarks from Fed’s hawkish voter (dissenter) George, as well as somewhat hawkish comments from the Fed’s Harker; the net impact of these was for risk assets to come under pressure.

The complex, seemingly mirroring moves in US equity futures, falling on disappointing Markit PMI data, which coincided with a broader risk off move. Brent fell briefly below the USD 60.00 handle before paring losses, whilst WTI found a floor around USD 55.00. Reports that Russian crude oil production has averaged 11.327mln bpd over the first three weeks of August may also have been weighing, given the country’s 11.191mln bpd OPEC+ production target. However, some desks argued that this increase might be temporary, not an indication of weakening Russian compliance, as the country looks to make up for a fall in production due to pipeline contamination issues during May through July. Taking more of a bird’s eye view of the complex, since the escalation in trade tension between the US/China at the end of May, WTI seems to be caught in the middle of a 50-61 range, with global growth-related concerns keeping a lid on prices at the upper bound, whilst risks to supply (Iran and Venezuela) provide a floor.

Yesterday’s FOMC meeting minutes revealed that the ‘mid-cycle adjustment’ phrase used by Powell was not an off-the-cuff remark, and as the Fed wants to give the impression it is not on a pre-set course. Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday are key (minutes were backwards looking, Powell is expected to provide some colour on future moves), although the markets seeming desire for a dovish outcome risks disappointing expectations. Nevertheless, those dovish expectations were cited by newswires as a reason for the buck’s weakness. There will be attention in whether Powell still fames the FOMC’s July cut as a mid-cycle adjustment (ie. a one-off), or whether he will allude to further loosening of rates; given that some FOMC participants have suggested that July’s insurance cut might have borrowed from similar insurance cuts in the 1990s, desks will be watching to what extent the Fed can frame three consecutive 25bps rate cuts as ‘insurance’, as it did in 1995 and 1998. Any disappointment out of Powell’s comments that leads to US appreciation will likely weigh on EMFX like MXN, INR, ZAR and BRL, analysts said.&nbsp;<strong>CNY:</strong>&nbsp;The buck’s strength has lifted USDCNY to fresh cyclical highs just shy of 7.10.

Following slightly hawkish Fed minutes on Wednesday, another wave of hawkish Fed commentary out of Jackson Hole kept risk assets on the defensive in early US trade. Additionally, PMI data saw the manufacturing segment fall into contraction, adding to the gloom. However, equities were supported in afternoon trade, with some suggesting that China purchases of US soybeans was a bullish sign, and attributed the news for helping stocks rise off lows and claw back earlier losses. Attention now falls onto the address of Fed Chair Powell at Jackson Hole (1500 BST/1000 EDT on Friday).</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong>&nbsp;Following a slightly hawkish FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, Jackson Hole commentary from Fed officials has started off on a hawkish note.&nbsp;<strong>Fed’s George&nbsp;(voter, hawk, dissenter)</strong> said it was not the time for further accommodation. George said that the rate cut in July was not needed, and she was not open to providing more accommodation without signs the outlook is getting weaker. She believes rates are at an equilibrium, and would be happy to leave rates where they are now. George noted that the economy has absorbed the downside risks, and is poised to expand<strong>.&nbsp;Fed’s Harker&nbsp;(non-voter, neutral)</strong> said that based on the state of the US economy, the Fed is where it needs to be, and he does not see a case for further stimulus. Harker stated that he did not agree with the July rate cut, but went along with it to get rates back to neutral, but indicated that he would not endorse a rate cut in September. He argued, however, that if tariffs hit consumers, then it would be a cause for concern, which may lead to changing his view. <strong>Fed's Kaplan (non-voter, neutral)</strong> said he was in favour of the rate cut in July, but is taking time to assess all factors heading into the September FOMC, adding that he would like to avoid taking further action on rates, noting they can impact savers and encourage more risk-taking. On the economy, he sees growth around 2.0% this year, but with downside risks.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong>&nbsp;China purchased a small number of US soybeans between 9-15th August, following on from declarations to stop purchases of US farm products, sources said. However, the shipment was very small. China imported just under 10k tonnes between 9-15th August for delivery in the current marketing year, Reuters reported, and 66k tonnes (around one cargo) for the next year. China's MOFCOM 5th August said that Chinese companies had stopped buying US ags, and the purchases reported today were a little surprising. Elsewhere, Chinese MOFCOM said it will have to retaliate if US persists on current course, adding that any new measures will lead to escalation; it declined to comment on possible retaliatory measures, but said it would publish an unreliable entity list soon. It also added that the impact from US tariffs were manageable, and China is fully confident it can handle all challengers. Finally, MOFCOM noted that China/US trade teams have been keeping in touch.</p><p><strong>* US LEADING INDEX:</strong>&nbsp;at 0.5% M/M against an estimate for 0.3%. July's increase follows back-to-back modest declines, with housing permits, unemployment insurance claims, stock prices driving the improvement. However, the Conference Board said that the manufacturing sector continues show signs of weakness, and the yield spread was negative for a second consecutive month. \"While the LEI suggests the US economy will continue to expand in the second half of 2019, it is likely to do so at a moderate pace,\" the Conference Board added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US PMIs:</strong>&nbsp;Often ignored by US players, but moved the market today after the manufacturing component fell into contraction. August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter, Markit said, the PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualized GDP growth of around 1.5%. \"The most concerning aspect of the latest data is a slowdown in new business growth to its weakest in a decade, driven by a sharp loss of momentum across the service sector,\" Markit said, \"survey respondents commented on a headwind from subdued corporate spending as softer growth expectations at home and internationally encouraged tighter budget setting. The survey compiler also noted that manufacturing companies continued to feel the impact of slowing global economic conditions, with new export sales falling at the fastest pace since August 2009. \"Business expectations for the year ahead became gloomier in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012. The continued slide in corporate growth projections suggests that firms may exert greater caution in relation to spending, investment and staff hiring during the coming months.\" Analysts warn about reading too much into the data, however, since the Markit PMI for the US has mostly given an unreliable read of ISM in the last year.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE PMIs:</strong>&nbsp;Prelim August PMI moved slightly higher, against expectations of a small fall, though remains in its 51-52 range, which Pantheon Macroeconomics says is consistent with GDP growth of around 1.0%. There was an improvement in the manufacturing PMI, though it still remains in contractionary territory for the seventh straight month, which will likely add pressure on the ECB; services ticked up slightly. Pantheon thinks that the song remains the same, however: manufacturing is still suffering, but services—effectively the domestic economy—is still relatively robust, the consultancy says, noting that new orders and output growth in manufacturing remain soft, primarily due to weakness in Germany, which dragged employment in this sector down for the fourth month running. By contrast, Pantheon notes that the services sector is more robust. Meanwhile, the German composite and manufacturing ticked up, while the services saw a trivial fall. New orders are still edging lower, while work backlogs fell at the quickest pace since 2012.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong>&nbsp;UK PM Johnson’s meeting with French President Macron failed to yield any breakthrough (hardly a surprise), with both reiterating arguments that we have heard in recent days. Despite that, rhetoric was constructive. Germany Chancellor Merkel once again gave an sanguine set of comments on Brexit; however, Germany had to clarify her remarks (that a backstop alternative was possible within 30 days), adding that she was not setting the UK a deadline, but she said “that what one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30 days.”</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE CONSUMER SENTIMENT:</strong>&nbsp;August Eurozone consumer confidence fell to -7.1 from July’s -6.6 reading, a slight miss on the expected -7.0, and largely consistent with recent lacklustre household spending data. Capital Economics said that August’s reading is historically consistent with household spending growth of between 1.5% and 2.0%. However, it caveats that since 2017, the measure has overstated household spending growth, and add that other factors such as the collapse of Italy’s government, the increasing risk of a no-deal Brexit and signs of a slowing labour market; as such the consultancy expects household spending growth is running at a more conservative 1.5% Y/Y.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong>&nbsp;Italian President Mattarella says new elections is a choice that cannot be taken lightly; some parties he has spoken to said they are working towards a deal to create a coalition, but needed more time. Mattarella says new consultations will be held on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the PD party is willing to enter a coalition government with the 5SM. The PD’s willingness to reach an agreement with 5SM increases the chances that the two parties can form a coalition, which would avert the need for early elections. With that said, analysts note that the PD’s demand could still prove to be a source of friction since they are likely incompatible with the 5SM position. The PD’s offer seems to be premised on five conditions, including loyal membership of the EU, giving Parliament a central role, and a reversal of Lega’s anti-immigration policies. One of the sticking points for a coalition would then be who would become prime minister, the BBC reported, since neither PD leader Zingaretti nor 5SM leader Di-Maio have shown any interest in the job, leaving questions on who would lead the coalition. If the two parties fail to reach deal, autumn elections appear likely, which raises the possibility that the Lega will storm the vote, winning a majority – a scenario analysts have said could put pressure on Italian assets.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES:</strong>&nbsp;The July meeting minutes echoed concerns expressed by ECB President Draghi during his post-meeting press conference; policymakers view the slowdown as more protracted than previously thought, with downside risks more pervasive. Moreover, from an inflation perspective, declines in both actual and longer-term inflation expectations are framed as “a matter of concern.” As such, members “broadly supported the proposal made by Chief Economist Lane to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options for future policy measures”. In terms of the scope and sequencing of potential further measures, the accounts noted “experience had shown that a policy package – such as the combination of rate cuts and asset purchases – was more effective than a sequence of selective actions”, a viewpoint largely in-fitting with recent comments from Finland’s ECB member Rehn, who called for an “impactful and significant” easing package. However, as suggested by Draghi himself last month, concerns were raised regarding possible unintended consequences of tiered rates and its ability to mitigate the potential negative impact of negative rates on banks, implying that a tiered deposit rate system is not necessarily a given accompaniment to rate cuts and asset purchases. It is worth noting that the meeting took place before the Fed July rate cut, thus any prior concerns held by policymakers have likely been heightened with members likely more unanimous now in their desire to present a comprehensive easing package next month. ING looks for “a 20bp rate cut of the deposit rate, a small tiering system, a repricing of the TLTROs and a restart of QE with some 30 billion euro per month” at the September meeting.</p><p><strong>* S.KOREA/JAPAN:</strong>&nbsp;South Korea announced it would not be renewing its intelligence accord with Japan; in recent rhetoric, South Korea has been threatening to pull out of the pact, but Japan had maintained the view that it wanted to keep it intact. Japan's Foreign Minister Kono said later that it is extremely regrettable that South Korea has decided to end their intelligence agreement. The breakdown of the pact is a blow to the US, which has benefitted from the intelligence operation to gauge North Korea’s missile activity; North Korea on Thursday carried out live fire drills by bombing replicas of South Korea's F-15K fighter jets, surface to air missiles, and a radar.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong>&nbsp;Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said he is prepared to work on France's proposals regarding a nuclear deal; earlier Zarif reiterated that Iran will not start a war in the Persian Gulf but \"will defend ourselves”. Zarif’s comments follow French President Macron’s on Wednesday, that he would hold talks with Iranian officials ahead of the G7 in attempts to salvage the 2015 Nuclear Deal.</p><p><strong>* TREASURIES: US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 7+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-09+. </strong>Major curve spreads were mixed at settlement, although +/- 1bps or so vs Wednesday’s settlement levels.

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>*USD: </strong>After trading firmer overnight and in European trade, the buck is slightly negative heading into APAC trade, after soft PMI data raised concerns about the health of US manufacturing, despite the data correlating poorly with the more-watched ISM. Yesterday’s FOMC meeting minutes revealed that the ‘mid-cycle adjustment’ phrase used by Powell was not an off-the-cuff remark, and as the Fed wants to give the impression it is not on a pre-set course. Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday are key (minutes were backwards looking, Powell is expected to provide some colour on future moves), although the markets seeming desire for a dovish outcome risks disappointing expectations. Nevertheless, those dovish expectations were cited by newswires as a reason for the buck’s weakness. There will be attention in whether Powell still fames the FOMC’s July cut as a mid-cycle adjustment (ie. a one-off), or whether he will allude to further loosening of rates; given that some FOMC participants have suggested that July’s insurance cut might have borrowed from similar insurance cuts in the 1990s, desks will be watching to what extent the Fed can frame three consecutive 25bps rate cuts as ‘insurance’, as it did in 1995 and 1998. Any disappointment out of Powell’s comments that leads to US appreciation will likely weigh on EMFX like MXN, INR, ZAR and BRL, analysts said.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>CNY: </strong>The buck’s strength has lifted USDCNY to fresh cyclical highs just shy of 7.10. Analysts said it was a sign that the gradual, controlled weakness of the yuan is being allowed to continue; however, IFR’s analysts noted that while USDCNY has hit fresh highs, the trade weighted CNY has not.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>EUR: </strong>Was trading in its familiar, thin range just beneath the 1.11 mark ahead of PMI data, which came in slightly better than anticipated, though doesn’t change the dial much; it didn’t change the EUR’s dial all that much today, either.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>JPY:&nbsp; </strong>USDJPY gains pared overnight, in wake of the FOMC minutes, after Japan’s economy minister said there were still gaps that needed addressing in a US/Japan trade deal.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>GBP:</strong> Commentary from French officials (Paris now has a default assumption of a no deal Brexit, sources say) has given Sterling traders a reason to be defensive ahead of the weekend’s G7 confab.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>AUD:</strong> Weak PMIs, which fell sub-50 are keeping the Aussie defensive, and the implied probability of an RBA October rate cut rose to 52%.&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, <strong>EMFX </strong>was under pressure, with FOMC slight hawkishness being cited by traders.</li></ul>",

A little bit of indecision has been seen in Thursday trade, with traders questioning if Powell will be able to deliver on the market’s dovish expectations. In pre-market US trade, Treasuries moves in sympathy with Bunds. However, the focus was back on Fed officials after remarks from Fed’s hawkish voter (dissenter) George, as well as somewhat hawkish comments from the Fed’s Harker; the net impact of these was for risk assets to come under pressure.

The complex, seemingly mirroring moves in US equity futures, falling on disappointing Markit PMI data, which coincided with a broader risk off move. Brent fell briefly below the USD 60.00 handle before paring losses, though has not managed to settle above the figure, whilst WTI found a floor around USD 55.00. Reports that Russian crude oil production has averaged 11.327mln bpd over the first three weeks of August may also have been weighing, given the country’s 11.191mln bpd OPEC+ production target. However, some desks argued that this increase might be temporary, not an indication of weakening Russian compliance, as the country looks to make up for a fall in production due to pipeline contamination issues during May through July. Taking more of a bird’s eye view of the complex, since the escalation in trade tension between the US/China at the end of May, WTI seems to be caught in the middle of a 50.60-60.90 range, with global growth-related concerns keeping a lid on prices at the upper bound, whilst risks to supply (Iran and Venezuela) provide a floor. Given veiled threats from Iranian President Rouhani yesterday (that if Iran’s oil exports are brought down to zero, international waterways will not have the same security as before) shows little sign of abating anytime soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound was breathing a sigh of relief as UK PM Johnson and French President Macron concluded their meeting in Paris with a relatively amicable press conference and a pledge to work together over the coming month in an effort to bridge the Irish backstop gap. However, Cable scaled 1.2200 from a low close to 1.2100 and extended through the previous mtd high (1.2210) all the way up to circa 1.2265 at best after German Chancellor Merkel suggested that a solution to the border impasse that complies with the Good Friday Agreement and keeps the integrity of the EU single market can be found. Her latest comments seem even more constructive (at face value) than Tuesday’s remarks that also boosted Sterling before some qualification (in that any ‘practical solution’ will not come via a renegotiated WA, but the PD). Indeed, Eur/Gbp (that has been a better barometer of Brexit sentiment) reversed through chart support ahead of 0.9100 and under 0.9050 vs 0.9155+ at one stage, as the single currency faltered after a post-Eurozone PMI spike.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar retreated further from recent highs in wake of a sub-50 US Markit manufacturing PMI, as new orders slumped from 51.7 to 49.5 and also hit decade lows. However, the <strong>DXY</strong> managed to hold above 98.000 (just) and gleaned support from relatively hawkish Fed commentary (via George and Harker) before the official start of the Jackson Hole Symposium, alongside broader safe-haven positioning that favoured the Greenback over other currencies apart from the Yen (and Gold of course).</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Euro was boosted by preliminary Eurozone PMIs that were better than expected in headline terms, but not so good at sub-component level. Hence, Eur/Usd struggled to sustain gains beyond 1.1100 again and retested circa 1.1065 lows for a 3rd time before ‘stabilising’.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie have been lagging all day and extended losses from recent recovery peaks above 0.6400 and 0.6800 respectively as risk sentiment soured again, with Nzd/Usd down to 0.6360 and Aud/Usd almost touching 0.6750 after downbeat CBA PMIs overnight.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Lonnie is still tethered to 1.3300 vs its US counterpart with little to choose from early NA data given that Canadian wholesale trade and US initial claims both beat consensus, while the aforementioned disappointing Markit survey was partially offset by a downturn in crude prices.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>No confirmation, but price action/behaviour since Usd/Cnh got to within a whisker of 7.1000 could easily be attributed to official or Chinese bank inspired defence of a tolerance level after MOFCOM comments stressing that any further US tariffs will be countered. Elsewhere, declines against the Buck on general risk aversion was an overall theme, but the Try was also hit by increasingly bearish technical impulses on its way down to 5.7900 and hardly derived any comfort from an upturn in Turkish consumer confidence as a result. Conversely, the Idr was relatively resilient after another unexpected, albeit not shock 25 bp BI rate cut as the accompanying statement inferred that might be the final one and done, or at least enough form the time being.</p>",

Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.4%) is kept afloat as Italian President Mattarella holds a barrage of talks with party leaders in search of a coalition to fill the country’s political void in order to pass the 2020 budget later this year. Meanwhile, UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.5%) marginally lags its peers as heavyweight tobacco stocks (Imperial Brands -1.0%, British American Tobacco -1.4%) weigh on the index amid news that&nbsp; the US House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into four e-cigarette companies, British American Tobacco, Atria Group (MO), Japan Tobacco (2914 JT) and Reynolds American; seeking information on Cos’ research into public heath impacts, marketing practices and promotion of e-cigarette use by adolescents. Moreover, broker downgrades for BHP (-1.7%), Anglo American (-2.0%) and Rio Tinto (-0.4%) adds further pressure on the index. Sectors are almost all in the red with cyclical stocks faring worse than defensives, in-fitting with the current risk tone. In terms of individual movers, Thyssenkrupp (+5.4%) shares jumped to the top of the Stoxx 600 amid reports that parties interested in Co's elevator unit include Advent, Apollo, CVC, Carlyle, KKR and possibly EQT, according to Manager Magazin. Meanwhile, BBVA (+1.3%) and Caixabank (+1.7%) benefit from broker upgrades at HSBC.</p><p>Amazon (AMZN) is on track to invest over USD 15bln this year in infrastructure, tools, services, people and programs to aid third-party sellers. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> Not the strongest G10 currency, but the Euro perked up in wake of the flash Eurozone PMI surveys that were firmer than forecast across the board. Eur/Usd started to climb after the French preliminary prints and then crossed 1.1100 and beyond when German and pan headlines maintained the recovery trend, but faded again before testing offers reportedly waiting at 1.1120. Note also, hefty option expiries between 1.1095 and the big figure may be exerting a gravitational pull given 1.65 bn rolling off at the NY cut.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY -</strong> The other major outperformers as the Dollar continues to drift post-FOMC minutes that failed to provide any further or clearer insight on guidance for the September policy meeting. Indeed, the DXY remains tightly bound just above the 98.000 handle and inside relatively narrow confines for the week so far (between 98.451-115), awaiting Fed chair Powell for clearer pointers (hopefully) at Jackson Hole on Friday. Meanwhile, Sterling is still seemingly taking the positive view that there is time left (albeit limited and decaying) to resolve the Irish backstop stalemate and reach some sort of Brexit deal before October 31, with Cable keeping its head above 1.2100, but capped by the 21 DMA circa 1.2154 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.9150 even though the single currency is underpinned as noted above.

Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.4%) is kept afloat as Italian President Mattarella holds a barrage of talks with party leaders in search of a coalition to fill the country’s political void in order to pass the 2020 budget later this year. Meanwhile, UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.5%) marginally lags its peers as heavyweight tobacco stocks (Imperial Brands -1.0%, British American Tobacco -1.4%) weigh on the index amid news that&nbsp; the US House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into four e-cigarette companies, British American Tobacco, Atria Group (MO), Japan Tobacco (2914 JT) and Reynolds American; seeking information on Cos’ research into public heath impacts, marketing practices and promotion of e-cigarette use by adolescents. Moreover, broker downgrades for BHP (-1.7%), Anglo American (-2.0%) and Rio Tinto (-0.4%) adds further pressure on the index. Sectors are almost all in the red with cyclical stocks faring worse than defensives, in-fitting with the current risk tone. In terms of individual movers, Thyssenkrupp (+5.4%) shares jumped to the top of the Stoxx 600 amid reports that parties interested in Co's elevator unit include Advent, Apollo, CVC, Carlyle, KKR and possibly EQT, according to Manager Magazin. Meanwhile, BBVA (+1.3%) and Caixabank (+1.7%) benefit from broker upgrades at HSBC.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>EUR - Not the strongest G10 currency, but the Euro perked up in wake of the flash Eurozone PMI surveys that were firmer than forecast across the board. Eur/Usd started to climb after the French preliminary prints and then crossed 1.1100 and beyond when German and pan headlines maintained the recovery trend, but faded again before testing offers reportedly waiting at 1.1120. Note also, hefty option expiries between 1.1095 and the big figure may be exerting a gravitational pull given 1.65 bn rolling off at the NY cut.</p><p>GBP/JPY - The other major outperformers as the Dollar continues to drift post-FOMC minutes that failed to provide any further or clearer insight on guidance for the September policy meeting. Indeed, the DXY remains tightly bound just above the 98.000 handle and inside relatively narrow confines for the week so far (between 98.451-115), awaiting Fed chair Powell for clearer pointers (hopefully) at Jackson Hole on Friday. Meanwhile, Sterling is still seemingly taking the positive view that there is time left (albeit limited and decaying) to resolve the Irish backstop stalemate and reach some sort of Brexit deal before October 31, with Cable keeping its head above 1.2100, but capped by the 21 DMA circa 1.2154 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.9150 even though the single currency is underpinned as noted above.

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Not the strongest G10 currency, but the Euro perked up in wake of the flash Eurozone PMI surveys that were firmer than forecast across the board. Eur/Usd started to climb after the French preliminary prints and then crossed 1.1100 and beyond when German and pan headlines maintained the recovery trend, but faded again before testing offers reportedly waiting at 1.1120. Note also, hefty option expiries between 1.1095 and the big figure may be exerting a gravitational pull given 1.65 bn rolling off at the NY cut.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>The other major outperformers as the Dollar continues to drift post-FOMC minutes that failed to provide any further or clearer insight on guidance for the September policy meeting. Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>remains tightly bound just above the 98.000 handle and inside relatively narrow confines for the week so far (between 98.451-115), awaiting Fed chair Powell for clearer pointers (hopefully) at Jackson Hole on Friday. Meanwhile, Sterling is still seemingly taking the positive view that there is time left (albeit limited and decaying) to resolve the Irish backstop stalemate and reach some sort of Brexit deal before October 31, with Cable keeping its head above 1.2100, but capped by the 21 DMA circa 1.2154 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.9150 even though the single currency is underpinned as noted above. Elsewhere, the safe-haven Yen retains an underlying bid around 106.50 amidst ongoing global trade and geopolitical tensions after tough talks between the US and Japan failed to produce a breakthrough and SK not renewing its intelligence sharing agreement with Japan.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>All on the backfoot vs their US counterpart as the Kiwi loses more ground after failing to sustain recovery momentum above 0.6400 and the Aussie likewise following fleeting bounces over 0.6800, but also undermined by CBA PMIs overnight showing sub-50 manufacturing and composite readings. The Loonie is holding up a bit better after Wednesday’s frothy Canadian CPI, but unable to rally too far beyond 1.3300 ahead of wholesale trade data later today.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Also weaker, partly on fundamentals and technically as Swedish unemployed jumped in SA terms and Norway trimmed its Q3 oil investment estimate, with Eur/Sek back up above 10.7000 and Eur/Nok hovering nearer the top of 9.9550-9145 trading parameters against the backdrop of faltering risk appetite.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Widespread losses against the Greenback, but Cnh and Try depreciation looks particularly eye-catching as the offshore Yuan teeters around 7.1000 amidst more warnings from China that retaliation is in the pipeline if the US presses ahead with extra tariffs on September 1st. Meanwhile, the Lira continues to list and tested 100 DMA support circa 5.7922 even though Turkish consumer sentiment picked up in August.</p>",

Prohibiting these rare earth exports to the US will significantly affect the hi-tech/electronic producers which may be forced to slow or even halt some US production.

The move higher resulted in a significant risk-off reaction in markets. The PBOC's response was somewhat predictable (China will not participate in competitive devaluation of the Yuan, although the currency move prompted the US to label China as a 'currency manipulator' by the US). Despite this, the daily USD/CNY fixing has been creeping higher (ex-last two days), whilst PBoC officials kept reiterating that the Yuan is at an appropriate level at present.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-china-goodwill-hunting-15-08-2019\">Click here for further analysts</a></p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>Furthermore, <strong>the minutes stated policymakers generally preferred an approach that avoided any appearance of the Fed being on a preset course </strong>and that policymakers who favoured a rate cut noted a decelerating economy as well as elevated risks such as the global economic outlook, international trade and the US inflation outlook, while a few expressed concern over the persistent 3-month/10-year yield curve inversion.</p><p><strong>Traders suggested the key from the minutes was the reference to the mid-cycle adjustment which suggests that Fed Chair Powell's use of the phrase was not an off-the-cuff remark</strong> at the post-meeting press conference. As such, traders said this would likely continue putting pressure on the 2s10s part of the curve, into inversion once again. In the wake of the minutes, Fed funds futures saw a <strong>98% chance of a 25bps cut (vs 93% before the minutes)</strong> and money markets priced around <strong>27bps of easing at the September meeting vs. around 30bps at the end of last week</strong>, markets priced <strong>110bps of easing through the end of 2020 which is unchanged vs. end of last week</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mixed as the region failed to sustain the early momentum from Wall St</strong> where sentiment was underpinned by strong retailer earnings and after the FOMC minutes did little to alter the landscape as they showed a divide among officials on rate cuts. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.1%)</strong> were both higher at the open with tech and energy the outperformers on the busiest day of the earnings season in Australia, while Tokyo trade was less decisive as price action eventually reflected a choppy currency and after a lack of progress in talks between Japanese and South Korean Foreign Ministers to resolve the ongoing spat. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.0%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%)</strong> were subdued amid CNY weakness and as Hong Kong’s property sector suffered the brunt of the Hong Kong protests with developers said to be reducing prices to support sales, although losses in the mainland have been cushioned by the PBoC’s liquidity efforts. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially unchanged amid similar uneventful trade in T-notes, but later saw mild support after firmer demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for long end JGBs and as risk tone began to deteriorate.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 7-day reverse repos for a daily net injection of CNY 30bln.

Furthermore, <strong>PM Johnson replied there is scope to do a deal when asked if he would make any compromises</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>UK opposition Labour Leader Corbyn invited leaders of other parties and senior lawmakers to discuss ways to stop a no-deal Brexit on August 27th. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>German Chancellor Merkel said she would welcome a negotiated Brexit deal but is ready for all outcomes</strong> and challenged UK PM Johnson to come up with a solution to avert a no-deal Brexit in the next 30-days. Merkel stated that the European offer stands to negotiate a deal after Brexit as their goal is to continue having tight relations with Britain post Brexit. (Newswires)</p><p>Italian President Mattarella will meet with the Democratic Party at 1000BST, Forza Italia at 1100BST, Salvini’s League at 1500BST and the 5-Star Movement at 1600BST today in order to decide the next steps for Italian politics. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>German Finance Ministry said early indicators suggest sustained slowdown in the industrial sector and that external risks have risen significantly which is fuelling business uncertainty, while there were separate reports the German government is reportedly considering a ban on negative interest rates for retail savers. (Newswires/FAZ)</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> traded rangebound overnight with only mild support seen in the aftermath of the FOMC Minutes. The greenback’s major counterparts traded uneventfully with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> relatively unchanged at the 1.1000 and 1.2100 handles respectively, while talks between UK PM Johnson and German Chancellor Merkel were seen to be amicable in which PM Johnson stuck to his guns regarding the removal of the backstop, but accepted the challenge to come up with a viable solution in 30 days. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was somewhat whimsical as it retreated below 106.50 and antipodeans were lacklustre with the initial support in <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> nullified as CNY depreciated to its lowest since early 2008 following a weaker CNY reference rate, which spurred speculated intervention by China state-owned banks to support the currency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>South Africa Treasury has instructed government departments to draft budget reductions of 5% for 2020, then 6% and 7% for the respective years after. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were lacklustre overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures subdued after it met resistance at the USD 56.00/bbl level and with prices reeling from the prior day’s declines despite the wider than expected draw in DoE crude inventories, as the gasoline and distillate components were bearish while there were also reports that construction restarted at Canada’s Trans Mountain expansion project which would eventually raise capacity to 890k from 300k bpd. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was subdued after the greenback got a mild bid post-FOMC minutes but with price action contained as participants still await the Jackson Hols Symposium, and <strong>copper</strong> was pressured as risk appetite gradually dwindled throughout the session.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>North Korea has carried out live fire drills by bombing replicas of South Korea's F-15K fighter jets, surface to air missiles and a radar. (Newswires)</p><p>French President Macron said he will hold talks with Iranian officials ahead of the G7 to make proposals and that he previously proposed some sanction relief or a compensation mechanism, while he added that in return for the offers, Iran must fully commit to the 2015 nuclear deal and broader negotiations on other issues. (Newswires)</p><p>Russian President Putin said the US could deploy new land-based cruise missiles in Romania and later Poland, which is a threat to Russia, while he added Russia will take appropriate, reciprocal steps and are ready to talk with the US. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve flattened on Wednesday; major curve spreads were mixed/little changed in the early part of the session, as traders awaited the FOMC's July meeting minutes. In wake of the minutes, there was more modest flattening; the minutes themselves were mostly as expected, although it did make a reference to the 3-month/10-year part of the curve (policymakers concerned over the persistent inversion). Interestingly, the \"mid-cycle adjustment\" comment made its way into the minutes, suggesting it was not an off-the-cuff remark by Chair Powell at the July presser. The 2s10s part of the curve narrowed modestly in wake of the minutes, but at settlement, had just about avoided entering inversion again. Attention now shifts to Thursday's ECB minutes, survey data, and the start of the Jackson Hole conference, all ahead of the weekend's G7 meeting; traders will be looking to policymakers for clues about both monetary and fiscal policy easing (and any indication of a quasi-coordinated effort). US T-note futures (U9) settle 6+ ticks lower at 130-17.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he is not looking at indexing on capital gains nor at a payroll tax cut right now as the economy is strong and it is not needed</strong>, while he added that he looked at capital gains indexing and that it helps high income people but he would prefer to focus on the workers. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump reiterated his criticism on the Fed in which he alleged that they “totally missed the call” and raised rates \"too fast and too furious\",</strong> while he also stated that Germany is being paid to borrow money whilst they have zero interest, whereas the US is far stronger and is paying interest and just stopped quantitative tightening.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mixed as the region failed to sustain the early momentum from Wall St where sentiment was underpinned by strong retailer earnings and after the FOMC minutes did little to alter the landscape as they showed a divide among officials on rate cuts. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were both higher at the open with tech and energy the outperformers on the busiest day of the earnings season in Australia, helped by improved results from Origin Energy and Santos, while Tokyo trade was less decisive as price action eventually reflected a choppy currency and after a lack of progress in talks between Japanese and South Korean Foreign Ministers to resolve the ongoing spat. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were subdued amid CNY weakness and as Hong Kong’s property sector suffered the brunt of the Hong Kong protests with developers said to be reducing prices to support sales, although losses in the mainland have been cushioned by the PBoC’s liquidity efforts. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially unchanged amid similar uneventful trade in T-notes, but later saw mild support after firmer demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for long end JGBs and as risk tone began to deteriorate.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed despite initially taking cue from the positive tone on Wall St where sentiment was underpinned by strong retailer earnings and after the FOMC minutes did little to alter the landscape as they showed a divide among officials on rate cuts. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) are higher as tech and energy outperform on the busiest day of the earnings season in Australia helped by improved results from Origin Energy and Santos, while Tokyo trade is less decisive with price action reflecting a choppy currency and after a lack of progress in talks between Japanese and South Korean Foreign Ministers to resolve the ongoing spat. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are subdued with Hong Kong dragged by property names as the sector suffers the brunt of the Hong Kong protests and with developers reducing prices to support sales, while losses in the mainland have been cushioned by the PBoC’s liquidity efforts.</p><p>In FX markets the DXY trades rangebound overnight with only mild support seen in the aftermath of the FOMC Minutes which stated a couple of policymakers would have preferred a 50bps rate cut to address low inflation and that several favoured maintaining rates, although most saw a 25bps cut as part of a recalibration of policy stance or mid-cycle adjustment in response to recent outlook changes. As such, some noted that the reference to the mid-cycle adjustment suggested Fed Chair Powell's use of the phrase was not an off-the-cuff remark at the post-meeting press conference, which further dampens hopes of a shift to an extended easing cycle and saw money markets price around 27bps of easing at the September meeting vs. about 30bps at the end of last week. The greenback’s major counterparts trade uneventful with EUR/USD and GBP/USD relatively unchanged at the 1.1000 and 1.2100 handles respectively, while talks between UK PM Johnson and German Chancellor Merkel were seen to be amicable in which PM Johnson stuck to his guns regarding the removal of the backstop, but accepted the challenge to come up with a viable solution in 30 days. Elsewhere, USD-JPY was somewhat whimsical as it retreated below 106.50 and antipodeans are lacklustre with the initial support in AUD/USD nullified by a weaker CNY reference rate.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively unchanged amid similar uneventful trade in T-notes and with participants awaiting the enhanced liquidity auction for long end JGBs.</p>",
