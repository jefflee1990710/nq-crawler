Additionally, there could be some \"mean reversion\" at play following the losses recorded on Tuesday post the Fed's emergency rate cut. Note that the BoC joined the Fed with a 50bps cut on Wednesday. The TPLEX saw steepening as sentiment improved and STIR traders react to central bank rate cuts, while \"catch up\" corporate issuance weighed on the long end of the curve. The steeper curve, alongside a renewed risk appetite, helped the greenback pare recent losses. The risk moves were also supported by strong ADP and ISM Non-Manufacturing. Health care (XLV), particularly insurers (UNH, CI, ANTM, CNC, HUM), outperformed today with the sector up over 5% heading into the tail end of the session as Biden staged a turnaround on Super Tuesday securing 10 state victories out of the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, resulting in a blow to Sanders who is an advocate for Medicare for all. Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) benefitted after the former’s CEO stated the co. is in a better position now to achieve profitability on an EBITDA basis in Q420 than it was on the initial announcement, while also adding its Eats business is benefitting from the coronavirus. United Airlines (UAL) announced it is reducing flights and freezing hiring amid COVID-19; trimming international flying by 20% and US flying by 10% for April, with similar reductions expected for May. Skyworks (SWKS) cut its Q2 guidance due to the coronavirus impacting demand; noting the virus has not disrupted manufacturing operations to date. General Electric (GE) reaffirmed FY20 guidance, although noted FCF from its manufacturing operations in Q1 will be hit between USD 300-500mln, and an impact on negative operating profit of USD 200-300mln Impact of COVID-19 is not included in outlook beyond Q1 but it is incorporated in its FY guidance. SPX +4.2% at 3130, NDX +4.1% at 8949, DJ +4.9% at 27,090.</p><p>The Treasury curve bull steepened pronouncedly as the front-end rallied amid global monetary policy easing – BoC being the latest G7 to cut rates. Desks noted a slew of real money/CTAs engaging in steepeners on Wednesday, finding some momentum on the back of a strong ADP employment report (183k vs. exp. 170k) and ISM Non-Mfg. (57.3 vs. exp. 54.9), in addition to a pickup in appetite for equities. Meanwhile, as more corporate IG issuers return to the dollar market, the belly- to long-end was under additional pressure as issuance played catch up following the two-week dry spell. Although one desk noted a particular asset manager who was keeping a lid on the steepening, selling a total of 34,452 TUs (2s) while buying 11,175 TNs (10s). The overhanging virus and potential QE is likely providing some support further out the curve. By settlement, 10-year yield had risen back to 1.00%, whilst the whole curve had steepened with the 2-year yield down 8bps and the 30-year yield unchanged on the day. US T-note futures (H0) settled 8 ticks higher at 136-08.</p>",

Earnings: KR &amp; COST.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Equities pared their losses on Wednesday, led by the Healthcare sector, amid Biden beating Sanders in Super Tuesday, thus lowering equity risk premium of a socialist government. Additionally, there could be some \"mean reversion\" at play following the losses recorded on Tuesday post the Fed's emergency rate cut. Note that the BoC joined the Fed with a 50bps cut on Wednesday. The TPLEX saw steepening as sentiment improved and STIR traders react to central bank rate cuts, while \"catch up\" corporate issuance weighed on the long end of the curve. The steeper curve, alongside a renewed risk appetite, helped the greenback pare recent losses. The risk moves were also supported by strong ADP and ISM Non-Manufacturing, although desks look past the figures due to expectations of them soon falling victim to COVID-19 - which continues to see a rising number of cases and deaths in Western nations now. Meanwhile, crude did not enjoy the rally as jitters grew on Russia's commitment for further production cuts ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on Thursday and Friday.</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada cut by 50bps, taking its benchmark rate to 1.25%. Money markets had priced around 40bps worth of easing, so the move was in line with market-derived expectations. The BOC also maintained its easing bias, stating that it stood ready to adjust monetary policy further if required, while it dropped the reference in its January statement which stated policy was at an appropriate level. The In its policy statement, the Bank said that while the economy had been operating close to potential, with inflation at target, the virus is a “material” negative shock (borrowing from other G7 central banker language) to the Canadian and global outlooks; business activity in some regions has fallen sharply and supply chains have been disrupted, reflective in CAD and commodities, the statement noted. The BOC also believes that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate further, which will depress activity. In light of all these developments, the central bank said that the outlook was clearly weaker now than it was in January.</p><p><strong>* SUPER TUESDAY:</strong> Joe Biden came out supreme from the Super Tuesday Democratic primary race, standing - at time of writing - with 365 delegates won (leaving total at 418), in a blow to Bernie Sanders who won 303 delegates (total at 363). Biden won Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia &amp; Maine. Meanwhile, Sanders won Colorado, Utah and Vermont, although also looks set to win California. The outperformance of Biden on Super Tuesday puts him in a strong position to secure the nominee, barring a major upset, and immediately subsided market fears of a Medicare for all policy pushed by Sanders (reflective in healthcare stock outperformance on Wednesday). As participants now largely expect a Biden vs. Trump 2020 election battle, the question for investors becomes one of who is the most \"market-friendly\", which desks have divided opinions on, although more generally see it as markedly closer call than the Trump vs. the pro-socialist Sanders. Additionally, there had been a consensus that Trump would have an \"easy\" time regaining office against Sanders, while the more moderate Biden would be more likely to gain wider votes, thus leading to a tighter race, giving investors more reason to entertain Biden's proposed policies. Looking ahead, the next primaries take place on March 10th, where states voting include Idaho (20), Michigan (125), Mississippi (36), Missouri (68), North Dakota (14), Washington (89).</p><p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS:</strong> ADP reported 183k payrolls was added to the US economy in February, topping the consensus 170k; the prior month's print was downwardly revised, to 209k from 291k (some analysts explained that the large downward revision was due to back-fitting past ADP data to the official BLS series, and not to over-read into it regarding the strength of the labour market). ADP said that the labor market remains firm, and that job creation remained heavily concentrated in large companies, which continue to be the strongest performer. However, Moody's economist Zandi noted in the report that it did not show any impact from the coronavirus: \"COVID-19 will need to break through the job market firewall if it is to do significant damage to the economy. The firewall has some cracks, but judging by the February employment gain, it should be strong enough to weather most scenarios.\" Zandi also noted that decent weather conditions helped the data.</p><p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING ISM (FEB): </strong>Rose to 57.3 from 55.5, beating the expected 54.9, and outside of the highest forecast; Business Activity rose fell to 57.8 from 60.9, below the expected 58.8, however. New Orders rose to 63.1 from 56.2, Employment rose to 55.6 from 53.1, and Price Paid fell to 50.8 from 55.5. On the surface the release shows a clear pick up in services, with the forward-looking components painting a rosier picture too. However, Oxford Economics notes the unfortunate timing of the survey, where the coronavirus has not yet delivered shocks to supply and demand (as looks like increasingly will be the case), and as of such, expects the index to take a tumble in next month.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 UPDATE:</strong> Cases continued to rise on Wednesday in Western economies as states warn and prepare for epidemics. Wednesday's official CDC report showed a rise of 3 deaths to a total of 9 in the US, with total cases standing at 80, although since then there have been reports of two more deaths, including California's first. The UK reported a relatively large 34 case increase, bringing the total figure to 85. In Italy, the government has now suspended schools and universities till mid-March, in addition to cutting public events such as concerts and theatre. In the US, congressional representatives agreed to an USD 8.3bln virus emergency bill; USD 3bln designated for R&amp;D of vaccines, therapies and diagnostic. Furthermore, IMF MD Georgieva said the IMF is to launch a USD 50bln aid package. In China, however, production seems to be edging back to normal, where companies have continued to announce more production increases, albeit tentative, including Apple (AAPL) which has reopened 38 of its 48 stores.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 0.40 LOWER AT USD 46.78/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLES USD 0.73 LOWER AT USD 51.13/BBL: </strong>Energy markets reversed earlier gains on Wednesday as jitters grew on the eve of OPEC+ that Russia would not provide its support. In the earlier session, sources reports, that members were pushing for production cuts in excess of 600k BPD and even more than 1mln BPD, in addition to wider risk appetite, kept positive momentum in the crude complex. However, the OPEC optimism faced headwinds on WSJ sources reporting that Russia had been opposed to a Saudi-proposed 1.2mln BPD additional cut. Note that earlier Iranian oil minister had said that he believes Russia would resist the cuts until the last moment, something that the market generally considers Russia’s de facto strategy to OPEC meetings. The JMMC technical committee, which concluded there meeting on Wednesday, reportedly did not reach an agreement due to Russia’s reluctance for additional cuts, according to a source, which suggested Russia wants an extension of the existing cuts to the end of Q2 while other members want between 1mln-1.5mln. However, the UAE Energy Minister later said, as cited by S&amp;P Global Platts, that the technical committee made a recommendation that Russia is onboard with, although would not provide further details. Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the latest EIA US inventory data was largely ignored, it was a bullish report however, where crude stocks built less than expected, including a chunky draw at Cushing, and both the products reported larger than expected draws, although production did rise to 13.1mln BPD with a larger decline than expected in refinery utilisation. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs lowered its oil price forecasts in which it sees Brent to trough in April at USD 45/bbl then recover to USD 60/bbl vs. prev. forecast of decline to USD 53/bbl then recovery to USD 65/bbl.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's <strong>Evans</strong> (non-voter, dove) said that he thought the Fed was well positioned but felt the rate cut would help boost confidence given rising risks and potential economic weakening – is comfortable with current policy position. Evans expects the coronavirus will have a short-lived imprint on US, with a quarter or half-year of slowing growth and a V-shaped rebound. The Chicago Fed President went on to say the possibility of hitting zero rates again means the Fed should use its ammunition. Fed's <strong>Bullard</strong> (non-voter, dove) spoke, saying rates are in the right place for now - Fed has taken out some insurance - but risks are rising that the virus could be more severe. Looking towards the March FOMC meeting post the emergency cut, Bullard said the situation is very fluid, not to prejudge and put a lot of weight on the meeting; although, said he sees downside risks and stands ready to adjust policy, with all tools on the table. On the emergency cut, Bullard said that the rationale was that if the Fed were to cut at the March meeting, it may as well cut now. However, Bullard did note that the economy at the moment is doing quite good and that the rate cuts could encourage investments that might not normally be made.</p><p><strong>* FED BEIGE BOOK: </strong>US Economic activity expanded at a modest to moderate rate over past several weeks with COVID-19 being cited as a risk, as well as already weighing on travel and tourism. Manufacturing activity expanded in most of the US although some supply chain delays were due to the virus and producers feared further disruption. Consumer spending generally picked up although growth was uneven across the US. Most near-term outlooks were for modest growth with the virus and the Presidential election cited as a risk. Employment increased at a slight to moderate pace, constrained by tight labour market; manufacturers, retailers and transportation firms had lower demand in some districts. Wages rose at a modest to moderate pace, pressured higher by the tight labour market and raise in minimum wage. Some firms were optimistic the Phase One trade deal would cut prices of goods, although some still struggled with tariffs and feared further of COVID-19's effects on prices. Although this beige book could be deemed as stale following the Fed’s emergency 50bps rate cut yesterday, it was the first to incorporate how the coronavirus has been affecting different parts of the economy, up until February 24th.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>Money markets are currently pricing in 100% chance of a 25bp cut at the next BoE meeting in the end of March after yesterday’s emergency rate cut by the Fed. Incoming Governor Bailey noted the BoE can take the bank rate down to about 0.1%, but policy ammunition is \"uncomfortably close\" to the average rate cut needed in a cycle, stating BoE does not have a lot of room for policy manoeuvre. Bailey also noted the need to act in a co-ordinated manner with the treasury to respond to the coronavirus, and that he is optimistic on this, and has already begun meeting with chancellor Sunak on assisting small firms and that coordination with other central banks should not be ruled out, but it is not always appropriate. Elsewhere, Deputy Governor Broadbent stated there could be a role for economic policy to support activity and credit provision amid the coronavirus outbreak, highlighting the BoE is in close contact with government officials and other central banks, but he noted what matters most will be the potential medium-term impact on inflation.</p><p><strong>* REPO: </strong>The NY Fed’s overnight repo operation was oversubscribed for a second consecutive day on Wednesday: USD 100bln accepted versus USD 111bln of bids. This comes after recent Term operations being oversubscribed too, at a time when the Fed is looking to taper its activity in the funding markets. As rates fall in the front-end, Primary Dealers (PDs) look to take further advantage of the cheap financing; some desks also note recent market vol as leaving dealers with more collateral on hand to repo too. Additionally, Treasury auction settlement is exerting further stress on the demand for cash, something which has been exhibited in recent rises in the GC rate outside of the FFR. The Fed’s party line is that it will remain in repo markets and bill purchases through the April 15th tax season, after which it would reassess; note Fed’s Bullard reiterated this on Wednesday. Further to the point, Credit Suisse’s funding market “wizard/guru” Zoltan Pozsar recently suggested that Fed rate cuts, in absence of open-ended liquidity support through its balance sheet (e.g. QE), would likely re-steepen the curve and cause further pressures on PD funding needs as money market accounts move into bonds, ergo, less cash on balance sheets available for repo.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 8 TICKS HIGHER AT 136-08. </strong>The Treasury curve bull steepened pronouncedly as the front-end rallied amid global monetary policy easing – BoC being the latest G7 to cut rates. Desks noted a slew of real money/CTAs engaging in steepeners on Wednesday, finding some momentum on the back of a strong ADP employment report (183k vs. exp. 170k) and ISM Non-Mfg. (57.3 vs. exp. 54.9), in addition to a pickup in appetite for equities. Meanwhile, as more corporate IG issuers return to the dollar market, the belly- to long-end was under additional pressure as issuance played catch up following the two-week dry spell. Although one desk noted a particular asset manager who was keeping a lid on the steepening, selling a total of 34,452 TUs (2s) while buying 11,175 TNs (10s). The overhanging virus and potential QE is likely providing some support further out the curve. By settlement, 10-year yield had risen back to 1.00%, whilst the whole curve had steepened with the 2-year yield down 8bps and the 30-year yield unchanged on the day.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> </strong>+4.2% at 3130,<strong> </strong>NDX +4.1% at 8949, DJ +4.9% at 27,090. <strong>Sectors</strong>: Health +5.8%, Utilities +5.7%, Staples +4.9%, Tech +4.3%, Industrials +4%, Industrials +4.2%, Materials +4%, Real Estate +4%, Communications svs. +3.6%, Discretionary +3.4%, Financials +3.3%, Energy +2.2%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Health care (XLV), particularly insurers (UNH, CI, ANTM, CNC, HUM), outperformed today with the sector up over 5% heading into the tail end of the session as Biden staged a turnaround on Super Tuesday securing 10 state victories out of the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, resulting in a blow to Sanders who is an advocate for Medicare for all. Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) benefitted after the former’s CEO stated the co. is in a better position now to achieve profitability on an EBITDA basis in Q420 than it was on the initial announcement, while also adding its Eats business is benefitting from the coronavirus. United Airlines (UAL) announced it is reducing flights and freezing hiring amid COVID-19; trimming international flying by 20% and US flying by 10% for April, with similar reductions expected for May. Skyworks (SWKS) cut its Q2 guidance due to the coronavirus impacting demand; noting the virus has not disrupted manufacturing operations to date. General Electric (GE) reaffirmed FY20 guidance, although noted FCF from its manufacturing operations in Q1 will be hit between USD 300-500mln, and an impact on negative operating profit of USD 200-300mln Impact of COVID-19 is not included in outlook beyond Q1 but it is incorporated in its FY guidance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*EARNINGS:</strong> Ross Stores (ROST) traded lower on poor guidance, Nordstrom (JWN) in the red after top and bottom line misses, while also adjusting its leadership structure. Dollar Tree (DLTR) hit on a revenue miss and poor FY guidance, HPE down on cautious CFO comments and mediocre earnings. Campbell Soup (CPB) surged after reporting solid earnings and an increase to its FY EPS forecast.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Two major Metro (B4B GY) shareholders denied they had been approached by Sysco (SYY) over a potential takeover so far, rebuffing the source reports yesterday. Elsewhere, Prosiebensat Media (PSM GY) is reportedly near a deal to acquire Meet Group (MEET), according to sources. ViacomCBS (VIAC) is reportedly seeking strategic alternatives for its publishing house, Simon &amp; Schuster, where the co. reportedly wants USD 1.2bln for the unit.</p><p>* <strong>FX WRAP: USD</strong> regained some of the post emergency rate cut losses aided by a weaker EUR and JPY while 10-year yields reclaimed the 1% figure. <strong>EUR</strong> trended lower throughout the day as cases continue to pick up in the EZ, which prompted EC to issue a technical recession warning. <strong>CAD </strong>traded flat against the buck after initially trending firmer on a slight (early) rebound on oil prices, although gains were wiped out after the BOC followed the fed by cutting 50bps while also leaving the door open for further easing. <strong>JPY</strong> undermined by the greenbacks recovery and as risk sentiment took a positive turn, which failed to benefit the precious metal which remains above the 1600 mark as it benefits from the global easing expected, diminishing real yields. <strong>AUD &amp; NZD</strong> both firmer today as AUD benefits from better than expected growth data, whereas NZD likely benefitting on the expectation of a reasonable 25bp cut (following suit with its Antipodean counterpart), as oppose to 50bps we have seen elsewhere, although money markets are currently pricing in 38bps worth of easing at the March meeting. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed as BRL continues to weaken despite firmer GDP, although Services PMI data was weak. <strong>RUB</strong> weaker as oil prices decline, boding well for <strong>TRY</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Desks noted a slew of real money/CTAs engaging in steepeners on Wednesday, finding some momentum on the back of a strong ADP employment report (183k vs. exp. 170k) and ISM Non-Mfg. (57.3 vs. exp. 54.9), in addition to a pickup in appetite for equities. Meanwhile, as more corporate IG issuers return to the dollar market, the belly- to long-end was under additional pressure as issuance played catch up following the two-week dry spell. Although one desk noted a particular asset manager who was keeping a lid on the steepening, selling a total of 34,452 TUs (2s) while buying 11,175 TNs (10s). The overhanging virus and potential QE is likely providing some support further out the curve. By settlement, 10-year yield had risen back to 1.00%, whilst the whole curve had steepened with the 2-year yield down 8bps and the 30-year yield unchanged on the day.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Energy markets reversed earlier gains on Wednesday as jitters grew on the eve of OPEC+ that Russia would not provide its support. In the earlier session, sources reports, that members were pushing for production cuts in excess of 600k BPD and even more than 1mln BPD, in addition to wider risk appetite, kept positive momentum in the crude complex. However, the OPEC optimism faced headwinds on WSJ sources reporting that Russia had been opposed to a Saudi-proposed 1.2mln BPD additional cut. Note that earlier Iranian oil minister had said that he believes Russia would resist the cuts until the last moment, something that the market generally considers Russia’s de facto strategy to OPEC meetings. The JMMC technical committee, which concluded there meeting on Wednesday, reportedly did not reach an agreement due to Russia’s reluctance for additional cuts, according to a source, which suggested Russia wants an extension of the existing cuts to the end of Q2 while other members want between 1mln-1.5mln. However, the UAE Energy Minister later said, as cited by S&amp;P Global Platts, that the technical committee made a recommendation that Russia is onboard with, although would not provide further details. Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the latest EIA US inventory data was largely ignored, it was a bullish report however, where crude stocks built less than expected, including a chunky draw at Cushing, and both the products reported larger than expected draws, although production did rise to 13.1mln BPD with a larger decline than expected in refinery utilisation. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs lowered its oil price forecasts in which it sees Brent to trough in April at USD 45/bbl then recover to USD 60/bbl vs. prev. forecast of decline to USD 53/bbl then recovery to USD 65/bbl</p>",

Usd/Cad touched 1.3400 in response from around 1.3340, but then breached the big figure on a second wave of buying as US non-manufacturing ISM beat consensus and added more upside impetus to the headline pair and <strong>DXY </strong>that pared more post-Fed declines to a 97.600 high (only a fraction below the 97.695 pre-intermeeting ease peak).</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the Loonie’s BoC-inspired travails, the single currency is propping up the major ranks after a rise in the number of nCoV cases in Italy and France prompted the EC to issue a technical recession warning for both Eurozone member states and the former to shut down all schools and universities with plans to ban all public events, shut cinemas and theatres. Eur/Usd extended its retreat from Tuesday’s 1.1200+ highs to just below 1.1100, but is now back above the round number and 200 DMA pending the ECB’s contribution to the combat China’s outbreak and contagion cause.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>All undermined by the Dollar’s broad recovery to an extent and the Yen also due to a risk revival more so than the Franc that remains mixed after more verbal SNB intervention and a dip back into deflationary y/y inflation. Indeed, Usd/Jpy rebounded through 107.00 following comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda sounding more concerned about the knock-on effects of the increasing global epidemic, while Usd/Chf held around 0.9550 and Eur/Chf remained towards the bottom of a 1.0705-1.0620 range. Meanwhile, Sterling was volatile amidst more speculation that the BoE may take a leaf out of the Fed’s book and deliver some pre-March policy gathering stimulus, with Cable straddling 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.8700 (with the 100 HMA and 200 DMA capping the upside respectively, latter for the 3rd time).</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The clear G10 outperformers, as the Aussie gleaned additional post-RBA traction from better than expected growth data, while the Kiwi piggy-backed on the premise that RBNZ might match its Antipodean peer with a more measured/standard ¼ point reduction of the OCR. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns appreciated against the backdrop of firmer oil prices and reports that OPEC+ may be discussing a 1+ mn bpd cut (albeit with Saudi Arabia pushing for more and against Russian resistance) another healthy looking Swedish PMI.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some respite for most regional currencies, as the Yuan continues to welcome efforts to contain the virus in China where the pace of contamination and fatalities seems to be incrementally declining, while the Lira is also hoping for a constructive conclusion to tomorrow’s talks between Turkey and Russia about resolving differences over the Syrian border. Elsewhere, little net movement in the Zloty after the NBP stood pat and retained a steady stance.</p>",

It is a statement only affair, however, governor Poloz will deliver remarks on Thursday after the release of the Economic Progress Report. In terms of the data, we have seen some stabilisation in recent metrics - the BOC had wanted to see evidence that a growth slowdown was persistent before it cut rates. However, the narrative has shifted, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, with major global central banks leaning dovish to cushion economies from the fallout. As such, the BOC has plenty of cover to cut rates, with some flagging risks of a deeper cut than the consensus implies.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p><strong>Asian bourses traded somewhat mixed following from the weak rollover from Wall St. where all major indices slumped around 3% despite the Fed delivering an emergency rate cut of 50bps</strong>, as this failed to alleviate the slowdown concerns from the coronavirus outbreak and the G7 statement on coordinated policy action also provided little in terms of details in which it did not commit to any monetary or fiscal action. Nonetheless, US equity futures partially nursed losses overnight as focus turned to Super Tuesday Democrat Primary results which showed former VP Biden performed well although there was still far to go with the biggest states California and Texas still up for grabs. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.7%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (U/C)</strong> were lacklustre with Australia pressured by underperformance in tech and the top-weighted financials sector due to virus fallout concerns and the lower interest rate environment, while the Japanese benchmark was indecisive amid a choppy currency and uncertainty regarding the Tokyo Olympics after a minister suggested the event could be held back although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later reiterated they will continue to move ahead with preparations. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

Meanwhile, US Treasuries are holding firm, though off best levels seen since the FOMC took bold action, as the 10 year yield sits sub-1% awaiting a busy US docket in terms of data and more pre-NFP pointers.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and Greenback in general have regained some composure after Tuesday’s slide in wake of the Fed’s early or emergency March policy easing, with the former back above the 97.000 handle within a 97.423-104 range vs yesterday’s 96.926 base. However, Usd/major and EM pairs are mostly softer after FOMC Chairman Powell refrained from signalling that the 50 bp inter-meeting rate cut would likely suffice to protect the US economy from nCoV contagion, leaving the door ajar for more stimulus if necessary.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/CHF/SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie appears to be building a firmer base on the 0.6600 handle vs its US peer on the back of firmer than forecast Q4 GDP data that will feed the notion of no back-to-back or follow up action from the RBA after its ¼ point reduction even though Deputy Governor Debelle warns that the bushfires and coronavirus will have more of an adverse impact on the economy in Q1. This has also lifted Aud/Nzd back above 1.0500 as the Kiwi continues to trail behind awaiting the RBNZ’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak later this month, with Nzd/Usd still struggling to advance beyond 0.6300. On that note, the Loonie is deriving some traction from another rebound in crude prices ahead of the BoC, albeit not as much as the Norwegian Crown given Eur/Nok rooted towards the base of a 10.3045-3730 band, as Usd/Cad pivots 1.3350. In terms of market pricing, -25 bp is baked in, but the probability of a like-for-like Fed move is also high at around 80%, hence options assigning a wide 75 pip break-even for the event. Elsewhere, while the SNB sits tight pending its quarterly review next week, Usd/Chf is holding circa 0.9550 and hardly acknowledging Swiss CPI slipping below zero y/y again, but the Swedish Krona has gleaned support from another upbeat PMI to straddle 10.5500 vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on the back foot as the Buck regroups, with Cable still unable to sustain gains above 1.2800 and respecting the 200 DMA (1.2830) amidst heightened BoE policy stimulus calls, while Eur/Usd has faded ahead of 1.1200 and hefty option expiries between 1.1200-05 in 1.6 bn as the coronavirus spreads and especially in Italy. Lastly, the Yen has pared gains around 107.00 following comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda indicating a higher level of vigilance for Chinese epidemic effects and a potentially lower bar for a policy response.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Broad recoveries across the region, and with the Lira also acknowledging positive comments from Turkish President Erdogan contending that a ceasefire can be forged at Thursday’s meeting with Russia to try and resolve the ongoing stand-off in Syria.</p>",

ASX 200 (-1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were lacklustre with Australia pressured by underperformance in tech and the top-weighted financials sector due to virus fallout concerns and the lower interest rate environment, while the Japanese benchmark was indecisive amid a choppy currency and uncertainty regarding the Tokyo Olympics after a minister suggested the event could be held back although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later reiterated they will continue to move ahead with preparations. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were temperamental despite speculation the PBoC could lower rates this month and after the HKMA moved in lockstep with the Fed through a 50bps rate cut, as participants also digested further weak data in which Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMIs printed record lows.

Nonetheless, US equity futures partially nursed losses overnight as focus turned to Super Tuesday Democrat Primary results which showed market-friendly candidate and former VP Biden performed well although there was still far to go with the biggest states California and Texas still up for grabs. ASX 200 (-1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were lacklustre with Australia pressured by underperformance in tech and the top-weighted financials sector due to virus fallout concerns and the lower interest rate environment, while the Japanese benchmark was indecisive amid a choppy currency and uncertainty regarding the Tokyo Olympics after a minister suggested the event could be held back although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later reiterated they will continue to move ahead with preparations. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were temperamental despite speculation the PBoC could lower rates this month and after the HKMA moved in lockstep with the Fed through a 50bps rate cut, as participants also digested further weak data in which Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMIs printed record lows. Finally, 10yr JGBs surged above the 154.00 level as they tracked the upside in T-notes following the Fed’s emergency rate cut and with the BoJ also in the market for over JPY 800bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia bourses trade mixed following from the weak rollover from Wall St. where all major indices slumped around 3% despite the Fed delivering an emergency rate cut of 50bps, as this failed to alleviate the slowdown concerns from the coronavirus outbreak and the G7 statement on coordinated policy action also provided little in terms of details in which it did not commit to any monetary or fiscal action. Nonetheless, US equity futures have nursed some of the losses overnight as focus turns to Super Tuesday Democratic Primary results which has shown the market-friendly candidate and former VP Joe Biden performing well although there is still far to go with the biggest states in terms of candidates; California and Texas still up for grabs. ASX 200 (-1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) are lacklustre with Australia pressured by underperformance in tech and the top-weighted financials sector due to virus fallout concerns and the lower interest rate environment, while the Japanese benchmark is indecisive amid a choppy currency and uncertainty regarding the Tokyo Olympics after a minister suggested the event could be held back although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later reiterated they will continue to move ahead with preparations. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%)and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are also temperamental despite speculation the PBoC could lower rates this month and after the HKMA moved in lockstep with the Fed through a 50bps rate cut, as participants also digest further weak data in which Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMIs printed record lows.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY languishes after the Fed announced a 50bps emergency rate cut but with downside stemmed after it found support at the 97.00 level and given that markets had priced in 75bps of rate cuts for the March meeting, while the comments from Fed Chair Powell did little to suggest whether a further 25bps reduction was on its way. The Fed move benefitted most its major counterparts in which EUR/USD tested but failed to surmount resistance at 1.1200, and GBP/USD was lifted to the 1.2800 handle where it currently resides just shy of its 100-Hour Moving Average of 1.2830 which has since capped price action. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially slipped below 107.00 to print a 5-month low but later rebounded in tandem with the risk appetite in Tokyo, and antipodeans are choppy with initial gains spurred by better than expected Australian GDP partially offset by the weak Chinese PMI data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs have surged above the 154.00 level as they track the upside in T-notes following the Fed’s emergency rate cut and with the BoJ also in the market for over JPY 800bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p>",
