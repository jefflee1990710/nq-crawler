There has not been much commentary out of the mid-level talks in Beijing between US and China trade officials; Treasury secretary Mnuchin was today quoted as saying the talks are currently &quot;so far so good&quot;, whilst President Trump later said the deal was going very well. A USDA official on Wednesday said agricultural issues still remain in the trade talks. And, adding to yesterday&#39;s commentary, the official said that US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi will meet &quot;sometime in March.&quot; it was reported that US Senators are looking to introduce a bipartisan bill which would introduce stiff sanctions on Russia&#39;s banking, energy and debt over election interference and Ukraine tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>Ahead of Friday&#39;s deadline, US President Trump is reportedly moving closer to signing a bill to avert another US government shutdown. Trump had been demanding $5.7bln for his border wall, though the bill only has $1.38bln funded, reports on the weekend had suggested. The Washington Post, citing a White House official, reported that Trump sees signing the border deal as it stands, if it is passed by Congress, as the way to avoid another shutdown. Other commentary suggested Trump was not happy with the details, so far, and he was likely to pursue an executive order to reallocate federal funds to his border projects. White House Press Secretary again on Wednesday said Trump wanted to review the legislation before signing it. Later comments from Republican Senator Graham suggested Trump would sign the bill, provided barriers and beds are as he expects, but would also likely declare a national emergency to gain additional funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> It was reported that US Senators are looking to introduce a bipartisan bill which would introduce stiff sanctions on Russia&#39;s banking, energy and debt over election interference and Ukraine tensions. The RUB came under pressure following the news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI:</strong> The Jan CPI was unchanged at 0.0% MM, with the core measure rising by 0.2% as expected. The YY on rate fell to 1.6%, from 1.9% (cons 1.5%). The monthly data has been steady, printing 0.2% MM for the fifth consecutive month. A reversal in energy prices (-3.1%) led to fall in the annual pace as the downward pressure on gasoline prices (-5.5%) paired rises in other sectors such as usually volatile apparel prices (+1.1%). Crucially, the data continues to exhibit a lack of inflationary pressures. Accordingly, Oxford Economics expects a pause from the Fed in the first half of 2019 and a reassessment of rates in Q3 once there has been a reassessment of the economic landscape. Meanwhile, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that wage rises feed through into inflation pressures in the services economy, and rent which pushes rate expectations higher in the medium term. Today&#39;s data has impact on expectations of Fed pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s George (voter, hawk) said her support for pausing rate hikes is to allow the Fed to assess the impact of previous hikes, she also said the economy is in a good place. Fed&#39;s Bostic (non-voter, dove) said that it was time to put our policy back onto a more neutral range and sees one rate rise this year as part of his model provided we stay at 2.5% GDP growth. On the economic outlook, Bostic said the govt shutdown is not going to appear in the numbers too deeply, but adds a layer of uncertainty; however, the slowdown in the Chinese and Euro Zone economies are definitely significant. Fed&#39;s Mester (non-voter, hawk) said the US is getting closer to the neutral interest rate and does not have a recession in her forecast currently. Fed&#39;s Harker (non-voter, dove) expects one rate hike in 2019 and one in 2020, saying the economy is in good shape and policy will be data dependent, with a patient &quot;wait-and-see&quot; policy stance. Harker expects GDP a bit above 2% in 2019, as well as inflation a bit above 2% in both 2019 and 2020; he echoed Bostic&rsquo;s comments of Chinese and Euro Zone - in particular Brexit and Germany &ndash; headwinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> It was reported on Wednesday that the Brexiteer, ERG group met with the Conservative chief whip Julian Smith to amend tomorrow&rsquo;s Brexit motion that PM May will bring to parliament, however the government reportedly refused their proposed changes and now the rebel group will not vote with the government. EU Council President Tusk indicated little bipartisan progress being made, where he said he is &ldquo;still waiting for concrete, realistic&rdquo; Brexit proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.80 HIGHER AT USD 53.90/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 1.19 HIGHER AT USD 63.61/BBL. </strong>Oil prices continued their upward path on Wednesday as the market remains bullish on Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s additional 500k BPD production cut. However, The IEA released its monthly report forecasts where it maintained 2019 global oil demand at 1.4mln BPD, demand for OPEC crude in 2019 to fall to 30.7mln BPD from 31.6mln BPD in 2018 and non-OPEC oil supply growth for 2019 raising to 1.8mln BPD (prev. 1.6mln BPD). The weekly EIA crude inventories were released; showing crude stocks building again this week at 3.6mln barrels vs. Exp. 2.7mln, contrasting yesterday&rsquo;s API data which printed a draw of 1mln barrels; Cushing, Oklahoma drew 1mln barrels vs. API printing a 500k draw and a contrast from last week&rsquo;s build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.29% at 2753, NASDAQ +0.02% at 7016, DJI +0.45% at 25543. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.29%, Materials 0.00%, Industrials +0.60%, Cons Discretionary +0.60%, Cons Staples +0.19%, Healthcare +0.24%, Financials +0.17%, Tech +0.13%, Telecoms -0.10%, Utilities -0.43%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) nosedived on the open after lowering its guidance, despite beating top and bottom line estimates, competitor Mylan (MYL) also underperformed. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) missed EPS and revenue estimates, but surged on the open after announcing corporate restructuring and share repurchases. Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG) outperformed after strong earnings and raising its quarterly dividend. Dish Network (DISH) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) underperformed after both missing EPS estimates. Deere (DE) opened lower on the back of a downgrade at BAML. Aptiv (APTV) benefitted from a new buy initiation at Seaport. Cisco (CSCO) trades at the bottom of the DJIA ahead of its earnings after the bell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 6+ TICKS AT 121-24. </strong>Treasuries sold off on Wednesday &ndash; seeing the US 10-year yield break through 2.70% - as risk appetite grew on China trade progress and hopes a government shutdown would be avoided. Corporate issuance saw USD 11.85bln raised in the market, following on from yesterday&rsquo;s USD 16.3bln, also adding to the sell off. The yield curve flattened today with spreads contracting between all maturities, the most profound being the 2s/30s and 5s/30s which both flattened by c. 2.3bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The broad Dollar and index have regained some momentum, partly on the back of marginally above consensus US inflation metrics, and latest reports from the White House suggesting President Trump does intend to put pen to paper on the proposed border funding deal with the aim of keeping Government open. The DXY edged over 97.100 as a result vs 96.621 at one stage, but not seriously testing or threatening to build on Tuesday&rsquo;s 97.200 multi-week and ytd high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>Still the clear G10 front-runner on the back of less dovish than expected RBNZ policy guidance, but drifting back further from overnight peaks circa 0.6850 and just shy of a key Fib (0.6857), partly due to the aforementioned Usd revival and some consolidation after the 100+ pip spike exacerbated by short covering (which dwarfed the 60 pip break-even move implied by options). The Kiwi now just below 0.6800 while remaining unreactive to comments from Governor Orr on housing prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK: </strong>The next best major, and also in wake of the first policy meeting of the year as Sweden&rsquo;s Riksbank reaffirmed intentions to raise rates again in the second half of 2019 based on solid domestic economic developments vs less certain and favourable international conditions. In sum, the outlook and assessment has not materially changed from last December when the Central Bank started to normalise the repo. Eur/Sek has now been down to 10.4050 vs close to 10.5100 at the other extreme, having sated demand between 10.4500-4400 on the way and with extra impetus from Governor Ingves predicting a stronger Krona over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, AUD: </strong>Vying for 3rd spot, and both deriving indirect support from regional currency peers along with the latest upturn in crude prices and broader risk sentiment. Eur/Nok hit lows close to 9.7500 and Aud/Usd slipped just below &nbsp;0.7100, down from 1 week peaks around 0.7135.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR: </strong>The Jpy has fallen victim to the latest leg-up in US Treasury yields and risk appetite, as the headline pair continues to inch higher and register new highs for the year in the process (111.01 so far). Meanwhile, the single currency staged another 1.1300+ sortie, but was undermined by yet more worrying Eurozone data in the form of ip and fell short of decent option expiry interest before retreating back down through the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CAD:</strong> Cable back around 1.2850 handle after a dip on benign UK CPI and then an unexpected and still largely unexplained rapid rally to just a few pips under 1.2960 and fade again. Potential drivers for the spike just before noon, a chunky Sterling futures purchase, stops and/or fix demand in relatively thin lunchtime volumes. Meanwhile, the ongoing rebound in oil helped the Loonie poke its head over 1.3250.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar and index have regained some momentum, partly on the back of marginally above consensus US inflation metrics, and latest reports from the White House suggesting President Trump does intend to put pen to paper on the proposed border funding deal with the aim of keeping Government open. The DXY just edged over 97.000 as a result vs 96.621 at one stage, but not seriously testing or threatening to build on Tuesday&rsquo;s 97.200 multi-week and ytd high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still the clear G10 front-runner on the back of less dovish than expected RBNZ policy guidance, but drifting back further from overnight peaks circa 0.6850 and just shy of a key Fib (0.6857), partly due to the aforementioned Usd revival and some consolidation after the 100+ pip spike exacerbated by short covering (which dwarfed the 60 pip break-even move implied by options). The Kiwi is now around 0.6820 and awaiting more from the NZ Central Bank later when Governor Orr is due to orate again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best major, and also in wake of the first policy meeting of the year as Sweden&rsquo;s Riksbank reaffirmed intentions to raise rates again in the second half of 2019 based on solid domestic economic developments vs less certain and favourable international conditions. In sum, the outlook and assessment has not materially changed from last December when the Central Bank started to normalise the repo. Eur/Sek has now been down to 10.4050 vs close to 10.5100 at the other extreme, having sated demand between 10.4500-4400 on the way and with extra impetus from Governor Ingves predicting a stronger Krona over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/AUD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vying for 3rd spot, and both deriving indirect support from regional currency peers along with the latest upturn in crude prices and broader risk sentiment. Eur/Nok hit lows close to 9.7500 and Aud/Usd is holding above 0.7100, albeit down from 1 week peaks around 0.7135.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jpy has fallen victim to the latest leg-up in US Treasury yields and risk appetite, as the headline pair continues to inch higher and register new highs for the year in the process (110.88 so far), but wary of major supply said to be layered up to 111.00 where barriers will be defended and Japanese exporters are said to be in situ. Meanwhile, the single currency staged another 1.1300+ sortie, but was undermined by yet more worrying Eurozone data in the form of ip and fell short of decent option expiry interest before retreating back down through the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Wednesday&rsquo;s EU session little changed vs the Greenback with Cable back on the 1.2900 handle after a dip on benign UK CPI and then an unexpected and still largely unexplained rapid rally to just a few pips under 1.2960 and fade again. Potential drivers for the spike just before noon, a chunky Sterling futures purchase, stops and/or fix demand in relatively thin lunchtime volumes. Meanwhile, the ongoing rebound in oil helped the Loonie poke its head over 1.3200, but unsustainably as the Usd found a footing and with decent option expiry interest between 1.3190-1.3215 also in the mix.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, US President Trump has also kept the door open for an extension to the March 1st tariff deadline if a deal was close. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) gained from the open although the former was later dragged lower by weakness in financials and as focus turned to earnings, while a weaker currency continued to fuel the dominance of the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) were positive with participants encouraged by the early arrival of US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and US Representative Lighthizer to Beijing which some suggested signalled a willingness to reach a deal, while source reports later noted that Chinese President Xi is scheduled to meet with the US delegation on Friday. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded choppy in which they initially tracked the downside in T-notes and with demand dampened by the risk appetite, although prices then recovered as investors returned from the Tokyo break despite mixed 5yr auction results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 270bln.

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports noted at least 3 &lsquo;Remain&rsquo; UK cabinet ministers plan to support Cooper-Letwin proposal on February 27th to end threat of a no-deal Brexit, while PM May was also warned a deal must be passed in 30 days or Parliament will delay the Brexit.

Sources earlier noted that if the 2019 budget does not pass (vote today) then the PM may call for an election soon after; also noting that Catalan will not vote in favour of the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish Riksbank Rate -0.25% vs. Exp. -0.25% (Prev. -0.25%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Riksbank&#39;s outlook has not changed to any great extent since the December meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The Central Bank reiterates that monetary policy needs to proceed cautiously</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are broadly in the green [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%], albeit off highs, as risk-appetite seen at the open somewhat waned ahead of US-China trade talks in Beijing. The materials sector remain the outperformer, while other sectors are predominantly in the green, although there is some slight underperformance in utility names. At the top of the Stoxx 600 are Ingenico (+9.2%) who beat on their FY revenue, with the Co. targeting organic growth of 4-6% for 2019. Alongside Swedish Match (+7.1%) after their Q4 sales increased. Heineken (+5.1%) are also higher after their earnings beat on estimates, alongside their shipments of their flagship brand increasing by their fastest pace in over 10 years by +7.7% Elsewhere, Wirecard (-2.9%) are once again in the red, following investors being notified of a class action lawsuit against the Co. and certain officers. Separately, at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are ABN Amro (-7.2%) after the Co. missed on their Q4 profit; Clariant (-3.0%) are also lower following earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD- The Nzd has descended from overnight highs, but remains well ahead of its major rivals in wake of a less dovish than anticipated RNBZ policy statement. Although the Bank retained the option to raise or lower rates and rolled out its OCR hike projection to 2021, Governor Orr refrained from cutting the odds of an ease despite recent disappointing data (like the Q4 jobs report) as many were expecting. Hence, the revised guidance sparked a short squeeze and scramble for cover that lifted Nzd/Usd up to around 0.6850 from circa 0.6730 at one stage, and well in excess of break-even pricing via options ahead of the event. Aud/Nzd recoiled to 1.0400 vs just shy of 1.0545, even though Aud/Usd also rebounded further from recent lows to 0.7135 or so at best amidst heightened hopes of a breakthrough in US-China trade negotiations and on the US Government funding front. Back to the Kiwi, 0.6850+ vs the Usd is still proving tough to overcome given Fib and MA resistance nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK, NOK - The Swedish Krona has also strengthened on CB factors, as the Riksbank maintained that the next tightening move is likely to come in H2 this year given very little change in the outlook for domestic growth and inflation since its last policy gathering in December (when the repo rate was lifted), even though external risks may be more pronounced. Eur/Sek has extended its retreat from 10.5000+ levels to fill reported bids at 10.4400, but not much further, while Eur/Nok has also continued to decline and is currently just above 9.7600 vs 9.8000+, with the Norwegian Crown deriving more momentum from another rise in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Conversely, the Pound remains hampered by Brexit-related issues with Cable fading again to sub-1.2900 levels and hardly helped by softer than expected UK inflation data. Note also, 1.2928 represents the 30 DMA and capped recovery gains made largely due to relative Greenback weakness, or a deeper pull-back from recent highs to be more precise (DXY down to 96.621 earlier vs 97.200 at yesterday&rsquo;s new 2019 peak).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - In contrast to the overall trend, Usd/Jpy has edged up again to register a fresh ytd high around 110.75, as firmer US Treasury yields and the ongoing improvement in risk appetite overrides all else. However, the headline pair still faces big offers at 111.00 where option and exporter interest await.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD - Both beneficiaries of the aforementioned Dollar downturn, but the single currency not quite able to sustain its rebound far enough to really arouse expiry option interest between 1.1370-75 in 1.3 bn, as Eurozone data continues to weigh and political risk remains prescient, this time from Spain that looks set for a snap election if the budget is voted down. Meanwhile, the Loonie has derived more encouragement from the latest leg up in crude, to test 1.3200 vs its US counterpart, but like the Eur could stall amidst decent expiries ahead of the NY cut (almost 1 bn from 1.3190-1.3215).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been fairly gradual, but Bunds and Gilts have both extended their rebounds from Eurex and Liffe lows, to 166.24 and 124.19 respectively (+22 ticks on the day each vs -16 and -7 ticks at one stage). The 10 year German benchmark probably indulged in a bit of stock taking as the Dax and other EU bourses saw best gains eroded, while a few stops may have been tripped through 166.08-11, which represented resistance on some charts. However, the next upside technical target area (166.24-26) has not been breached and the core EZ debt future could have lost some momentum in wake of auction results as Germany&rsquo;s 2046 tap was not that well received in comparison to Italy&rsquo;s heftier 2-tier offerings, overall. Indeed, BTPs have reclaimed 127.00+ status and more in recent trade. Back to Liffe, UK bonds did derive some extra impetus from soft CPI, along with Short Sterling contracts, but US Treasuries appear reluctant to tag along ahead of US inflation data and another relatively full compliment of Fed speakers. Futures are narrowly mixed and the curve marginally flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.2%) and Brent (+1.5%) are holding onto most of yesterday&rsquo;s Saudi-induced gains with prices underpinned after the API crude inventories printed an unexpected drawdown (-0.998mln vs. Exp. +2.700mln). The session also saw the release of the IEA monthly report which deviated slightly from the EIA STEO published yesterday. The IEA maintained 2019 global oil demand (compared to EIA&rsquo;s modest downgrade), whilst raising non-OPEC supply growth (in-fitting with the OPEC and EIA reports) and cutting OPEC crude demand. Little sustained reaction was seen across the energy benchmarks post-release. On a more optimistic note, Goldman Sachs continues to expect further upside for Brent crude prices, citing resilient demand growth topping low expectations, as well as large OPEC supply cuts. Finally, traders will be eyeing the release of the weekly DoE&rsquo;s later today with focus on US production, as usual. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (Unch) prices are marginally firmer on the day as the pullback in the DXY&rsquo;s yearly highs helped the yellow metal nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses. Furthermore, CFTC data show that money managers have cut their bullish gold bets over 6k net long positions to just under 44k. This roll-back in gold-bulls comes amid as US President Trump downplayed the threat of a second government shutdown alongside hopes of positive US-Sino trade developments with Chinese President Xi reportedly to meet with key members of the US trade delegation on Friday.

The materials sector remain the outperformer, while other sectors are predominantly in the green, although there is some slight underperformance in utility names. At the top of the Stoxx 600 are Ingenico (+9.2%) who beat on their FY revenue, with the Co. targeting organic growth of 4-6% for 2019. Alongside Swedish Match (+7.1%) after their Q4 sales increased. Heineken (+5.1%) are also higher after their earnings beat on estimates, alongside their shipments of their flagship brand increasing by their fastest pace in over 10 years by +7.7% Elsewhere, Wirecard (-2.9%) are once again in the red, following investors being notified of a class action lawsuit against the Co. and certain officers. Separately, at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are ABN Amro (-7.2%) after the Co. missed on their Q4 profit; Clariant (-3.0%) are also lower following earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD- The Nzd has descended from overnight highs, but remains well ahead of its major rivals in wake of a less dovish than anticipated RNBZ policy statement. Although the Bank retained the option to raise or lower rates and rolled out its OCR hike projection to 2021, Governor Orr refrained from cutting the odds of an ease despite recent disappointing data (like the Q4 jobs report) as many were expecting. Hence, the revised guidance sparked a short squeeze and scramble for cover that lifted Nzd/Usd up to around 0.6850 from circa 0.6730 at one stage, and well in excess of break-even pricing via options ahead of the event. Aud/Nzd recoiled to 1.0400 vs just shy of 1.0545, even though Aud/Usd also rebounded further from recent lows to 0.7135 or so at best amidst heightened hopes of a breakthrough in US-China trade negotiations and on the US Government funding front. Back to the Kiwi, 0.6850+ vs the Usd is still proving tough to overcome given Fib and MA resistance nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK, NOK - The Swedish Krona has also strengthened on CB factors, as the Riksbank maintained that the next tightening move is likely to come in H2 this year given very little change in the outlook for domestic growth and inflation since its last policy gathering in December (when the repo rate was lifted), even though external risks may be more pronounced. Eur/Sek has extended its retreat from 10.5000+ levels to fill reported bids at 10.4400, but not much further, while Eur/Nok has also continued to decline and is currently just above 9.7600 vs 9.8000+, with the Norwegian Crown deriving more momentum from another rise in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Conversely, the Pound remains hampered by Brexit-related issues with Cable fading again to sub-1.2900 levels and hardly helped by softer than expected UK inflation data. Note also, 1.2928 represents the 30 DMA and capped recovery gains made largely due to relative Greenback weakness, or a deeper pull-back from recent highs to be more precise (DXY down to 96.621 earlier vs 97.200 at yesterday&rsquo;s new 2019 peak).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - In contrast to the overall trend, Usd/Jpy has edged up again to register a fresh ytd high around 110.75, as firmer US Treasury yields and the ongoing improvement in risk appetite overrides all else. However, the headline pair still faces big offers at 111.00 where option and exporter interest await.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD - Both beneficiaries of the aforementioned Dollar downturn, but the single currency not quite able to sustain its rebound far enough to really arouse expiry option interest between 1.1370-75 in 1.3 bn, as Eurozone data continues to weigh and political risk remains prescient, this time from Spain that looks set for a snap election if the budget is voted down. Meanwhile, the Loonie has derived more encouragement from the latest leg up in crude, to test 1.3200 vs its US counterpart, but like the Eur could stall amidst decent expiries ahead of the NY cut (almost 1 bn from 1.3190-1.3215).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been fairly gradual, but Bunds and Gilts have both extended their rebounds from Eurex and Liffe lows, to 166.24 and 124.19 respectively (+22 ticks on the day each vs -16 and -7 ticks at one stage). The 10 year German benchmark probably indulged in a bit of stock taking as the Dax and other EU bourses saw best gains eroded, while a few stops may have been tripped through 166.08-11, which represented resistance on some charts. However, the next upside technical target area (166.24-26) has not been breached and the core EZ debt future could have lost some momentum in wake of auction results as Germany&rsquo;s 2046 tap was not that well received in comparison to Italy&rsquo;s heftier 2-tier offerings, overall. Indeed, BTPs have reclaimed 127.00+ status and more in recent trade. Back to Liffe, UK bonds did derive some extra impetus from soft CPI, along with Short Sterling contracts, but US Treasuries appear reluctant to tag along ahead of US inflation data and another relatively full compliment of Fed speakers. Futures are narrowly mixed and the curve marginally flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.2%) and Brent (+1.5%) are holding onto most of yesterday&rsquo;s Saudi-induced gains with prices underpinned after the API crude inventories printed an unexpected drawdown (-0.998mln vs. Exp. +2.700mln). The session also saw the release of the IEA monthly report which deviated slightly from the EIA STEO published yesterday. The IEA maintained 2019 global oil demand (compared to EIA&rsquo;s modest downgrade), whilst raising non-OPEC supply growth (in-fitting with the OPEC and EIA reports) and cutting OPEC crude demand. Little sustained reaction was seen across the energy benchmarks post-release. On a more optimistic note, Goldman Sachs continues to expect further upside for Brent crude prices, citing resilient demand growth topping low expectations, as well as large OPEC supply cuts. Finally, traders will be eyeing the release of the weekly DoE&rsquo;s later today with focus on US production, as usual. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (Unch) prices are marginally firmer on the day as the pullback in the DXY&rsquo;s yearly highs helped the yellow metal nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses. Furthermore, CFTC data show that money managers have cut their bullish gold bets over 6k net long positions to just under 44k. This roll-back in gold-bulls comes amid as US President Trump downplayed the threat of a second government shutdown alongside hopes of positive US-Sino trade developments with Chinese President Xi reportedly to meet with key members of the US trade delegation on Friday. Meanwhile gains for copper remain limited amid weakness in Dalian iron ore prices following its recent rally.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>KIWI/AUSSIE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nzd has descended from overnight highs, but remains well ahead of its major rivals in wake of a less dovish than anticipated RNBZ policy statement. Although the Bank retained the option to raise or lower rates and rolled out its OCR hike projection to 2021, Governor Orr refrained from cutting the odds of an ease despite recent disappointing data (like the Q4 jobs report) as many were expecting. Hence, the revised guidance sparked a short squeeze and scramble for cover that lifted Nzd/Usd up to around 0.6850 from circa 0.6730 at one stage, and well in excess of break-even pricing via options ahead of the event. Aud/Nzd recoiled to 1.0400 vs just shy of 1.0545, even though Aud/Usd also rebounded further from recent lows to 0.7135 or so at best amidst heightened hopes of a breakthrough in US-China trade negotiations and on the US Government funding front. Back to the Kiwi, 0.6850+ vs the Usd is still proving tough to overcome given Fib and MA resistance nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Swedish Krona has also strengthened on CB factors, as the Riksbank maintained that the next tightening move is likely to come in H2 this year given very little change in the outlook for domestic growth and inflation since its last policy gathering in December (when the repo rate was lifted), even though external risks may be more pronounced. Eur/Sek has extended its retreat from 10.5000+ levels to fill reported bids at 10.4400, but not much further, while Eur/Nok has also continued to decline and is currently just above 9.7600 vs 9.8000+, with the Norwegian Crown deriving more momentum from another rise in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the Pound remains hampered by Brexit-related issues with Cable fading again to sub-1.2900 levels and hardly helped by softer than expected UK inflation data. Note also, 1.2928 represents the 30 DMA and capped recovery gains made largely due to relative Greenback weakness, or a deeper pull-back from recent highs to be more precise (DXY down to 96.621 earlier vs 97.200 at yesterday&rsquo;s new 2019 peak).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the overall trend, Usd/Jpy has edged up again to register a fresh ytd high around 110.75, as firmer US Treasury yields and the ongoing improvement in risk appetite overrides all else. However, the headline pair still faces big offers at 111.00 where option and exporter interest await.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both beneficiaries of the aforementioned Dollar downturn, but the single currency not quite able to sustain its rebound far enough to really arouse expiry option interest between 1.1370-75 in 1.3 bn, as Eurozone data continues to weigh and political risk remains prescient, this time from Spain that looks set for a snap election if the budget is voted down. Meanwhile, the Loonie has derived more encouragement from the latest leg up in crude, to test 1.3200 vs its US counterpart, but like the Eur could stall amidst decent expiries ahead of the NY cut (almost 1 bn from 1.3190-1.3215).</p>\r\n",

(SCMP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Barclay said both sides want to see a Brexit deal and that he will speak again to EU&#39;s Brexit Negotiator Barnier after Thursday&#39;s vote, while there were separate comments from UK Foreign Minister Hunt that there is a real &quot;hunger&quot; to find a Brexit path following meeting with French officials and that it is possible to get a deal by March 29. (Newswires)<br /><br />UK PM May&#39;s chief Brexit negotiator Robbins claimed MPs will be presented with a choice between PM May&#39;s deal or a lengthy delay.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most currencies traded quiet in which the DXY remained softer following its pullback from YTD highs to below the 97.00 level. This helped most its major counterparts recover loss ground with EUR/USD and GBP/USD back at the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively, while JPY was the exception as the vigorous risk-sentiment in Japan continued to spur outflows from the safe-haven currency. Antipodeans also firmed against the greenback led by NZD/USD after the RBNZ maintained the OCR at 1.75% as expected and kept the possibility open for the next move in rates to be either up or down with the statement interpreted as less dovish than expected considering the recent shift by its global peers, while RBNZ Governor Orr further disappointed the dovish bets as he stated the chance of a rate cut has not increased</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ kept the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 1.75% as expected. RBNZ said it expects to keep the cash rate at the current level through 2020 and that the next direction could be up or down, while it forecasts the OCR at 1.84% in December 2020 and 2.36% in March 2022. Furthermore, RBNZ Governor Orr commented during the press conference that the chance of a rate cut has not increased and that the possibility of a rate cut is not ruled out, but his best guess is we stay on hold for a long period. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly higher overnight with the complex supported by the risk appetite which kept WTI crude futures firmer, while oil prices had already gained in the prior session amid reports of Saudi and Russia output reductions, as well as the surprise draw in API crude inventories. Elsewhere, upside in gold was only minimal as the effects of a subdued greenback was counterbalanced by the lack of safe-haven demand, while gains for copper were also limited amid early weakness in Dalian iron ore futures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (8 Feb) -0.998mln vs. Exp. +2.7mln (prev. +2.514mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&#39;s Energy Minister Novak said Russia&#39;s February oil output will decrease by 90k-100k BPD vs. October&#39;s level (January decreased by 47k vs. October), while he added that OPEC and Non-OPEC charter is being discussed in which there is unanimous support for it.

(FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries drifted lower strong demand for equities fuelled by US and China optimism as well as hopes that another government shutdown can be avoided. The yield curve bear-steepened slightly with most of the action concentrated in the belly and long end of the curve where yields were higher by c.2bps at settlement. Altria (MO) raised USD 11.5bln in seven parts to finance its stake in Juul Labs. Spreads mostly widened with the exception of 10s30s. US T-note futures (H9) settled 5+ ticks lower at 121-30+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he does not expect a government shutdown and is still considering a national emergency on the wall, while reports also had noted that US President Trump was not happy with the bipartisan deal on border security. (Newswires/WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that he was presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal and that he is looking over all aspects knowing that it will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. Trump added they will be getting almost USD 23bln for Border Security and that regardless of wall money, it is being built as we speak. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s George (Voter, Hawk) said her support for pausing rate hike is to allow Fed to assess impact of previous hikes and also commented that the economy is in a good place.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher with global sentiment underpinned after US government shutdown fears abated and amid increasing hopes for a US-China trade breakthrough after the senior US delegation arrived in Beijing ahead of schedule, while US President Trump also kept the door open for an extension to the March 1st tariff deadline if a deal was close. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) gained from the open although the former was later dragged lower by weakness in financials and as focus turned to earnings, while a weaker currency continued to fuel the dominance of the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) began positive with participants encouraged by the early arrival of US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and US Representative Lighthizer to Beijing which some suggested signalled a willingness to reach a deal, although gains were capped by another substantial daily liquidity drain by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most pairs trade quiet with the DXY remaining softer following its pullback from YTD highs to below the 97.00 level. This has helped most its major counterparts recover loss ground with EUR/USD back at the 1.1300 handle and GBP/USD eyeing 1.2900 to the upside, while JPY was the exception as the vigorous risk-sentiment in Japan continued to spur outflows from the safe-haven currency. Antipodeans also firmed against the greenback led by NZD/USD after the RBNZ maintained the OCR at 1.75% as expected and kept the possibility open for the next move in rates to be either up or down, with the statement interpreted as less dovish than expected considering the recent dovish tilt by its global peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they track the downside in T-notes&nbsp;and with demand dampened by the risk appetite, while participants are also sidelined ahead of the 5yr auction later. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This change of gear by the Fed effectively lessened the pressure for other central banks to follow suit to the hiking cycle that had previous occurred in the US, while ongoing global growth concerns and trade-related uncertainty further contributes to the dovish tone from policy setters including the RBA which just recently switched to a more balanced view on rates. Therefore, it is seen as highly unlikely that the RBNZ will be rushing to tighten policy especially as it has continuously stressed its guidance of rates to remain unchanged until 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a recap of the other past comments from the central bank, the RBNZ stated at the last meeting that timing and direction of any future rate OCR moves remains data dependent. In addition, Governor Orr has stated he is comfortable with the foot still on the accelerator, while he also previously noted they are not taking a rate cut off the table and would consider reducing rates if GDP falls short of projection. With these comments in mind, it wouldn&#39;t be much of a surprise if the RBNZ maintains a wait and see approach, which is also backed by the mixed data from New Zealand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The varied key economic releases includes jobs data as Employment Change missed estimates for Q4 at 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 1.1%) and the Unemployment Rate jumped to 4.3% from 3.9% despite a decline in the Participation Rate, while CPI was more encouraging with Q/Q at 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.0% (Prev. 0.9%) and Y/Y at Q4 1.9% vs. Exp. 1.8% (Prev. 1.9%) which remains in close proximity to the mid-point of the RBNZ&#39;s 1%-3% medium-term target range. Furthermore, the most recent growth figures for Q3 were inconclusive as New Zealand GDP Q/Q slowed to 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 1.0%) but Y/Y rose to 3.0% vs. Exp. 2.8% (Prev. 2.8%). This suggests it would be well-advised for the central bank to wait for the Q4 and full year figures to get a better picture of the economy; a view similarly held by UBS which stated that if New Zealand Q4 GDP is below 0.5% it could spur concerns in the RBNZ and stoke expectations for a rate cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate decision is due on Wednesday at 1400 local time or 0100GMT/1900CST/0900HKT and focus will also be on the central bank&#39;s statement if it follows suit to the more dovish tone seen in some of the other major global central banks, while RBNZ will also be conducting an MPS press conference 1 hour following the announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Comments and Calls<br />- ASB Bank revised its forecasts in which it now expects the OCR to remain unchanged into 2021.<br />- ANZ expects the RBNZ to cut cash rate in November this year and sees the cash rate declining to as low as 1.00% through 2020, while it expects a dovish tone inline with other major central banks.<br />- BNZ said RBNZ may note risks are equally balanced and may mention risks related to global growth.<br />- Deutsche Bank said it expects RBNZ to not hike rates until 2020.<br />- New Zealand Shadow Board said it sees less need for the RBNZ to hike interest rates.</p>\r\n",
