It was another choppy session for the TPLEX, which has ultimately seen yields in the shorter part of the curve fall by around 4.5bps, while the longer end was down by just under 1bps, at settlement; the shape of the curve, however, was steeper to the tune of 1-3bps. It was, of course, COVID19 headlines that were dictating the action, and the curve was influencing the FX space via the rate differential channel, which subsequently saw the USD come under pressure, particularly against the JPY. The US sold 7-year notes in an unspectacular auction, which tailed by 1.4bps, though cover had firmed versus recent averages. For now, Fed officials seem to be comfortable monitoring the risks, although markets seem to be somewhat less patient, and have priced in nearly three rate cuts through the end of this year. Analysts have said that whether this transpires on not will likely depend on the speed of the normalisation, and what actions US corporates could take in response (cutting guidance has been seen, but some have warned they may be far more worried by job cuts).</p><p>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX -4.43%, DJ -4.4% at 25,760, Nasdaq -4.6% at 8566 * STOCK SPECIFICS: US equities traded heavily in the red once again with weekly losses on track for its worst performance since 2008. Microsoft (MSFT) were hit as it cut its Q3 personal computing segment revenue guidance due to coronavirus, sees supply chain returning to normal operations at a slower pace than previously expected. JP Morgan analyst Mark Murphy highlighted it is not a demand issue and the segment is its least strategic segment, noting all other segment guidance is unchanged. However, RBC note the worst scenario is a possible EPS decline of 21%. PayPal (PYPL) also issued updated guidance, where it expects Q1 revenue towards lower end of its previous guided USD 4.78-4.84bln range as a result of the coronavirus; note competitor Mastercard (MA) also recently cut its guidance. Gilead (GILD) traded higher as it initiated two Phase III studies of investigational antiviral Remdesivir for the treatment of coronavirus, with studies in Asian countries to being in March. Of note for food delivery names (GRUB, UBER) NYC council is considering a package of bills aimed at how much delivery companies can charge restaurants, and elsewhere in the space, DoorDash formally filed draft IPO documents with the SEC.</p>",

More cases have been reported in Europe, and even in the US, California said it has some 8400 people on its monitoring list. There were fresh record lows for 10-year and 30-year bond yields, while the VIX scaled 37. Some made the case that technical factors helped support SPX rising off lows (the folks at JPM argued on Wednesday that systematic selling and option hedging as well as poor liquidity was a major driver of downside, and argued that a short-term bounce was more likely than not). Central bank officials, however, do not seem in a rush to act; both ECB and Fed policymakers have indicated that they are monitoring the situation, but have appeared to suggest that policy settings are right for now (Lagarde was on that page today from the ECB, while a number of influential Fed officials have said as much recently) indicating monetary authorities are in no rush to give a nod to dovish market pricing (market has now almost completely priced in three Fed rate cuts in 2020). The bias clearly is to the downside, with desks now questioning how low we can go. Goldman Sachs today lowered its SPX target to 2,900, and provided scenario analysis which showed that in the event that the US entered a recession, the SPX would be unlikely to bounce back to the 3,400 level it sees in its upside scenarios; GS said to look for the S&amp;P 500 forward P/E multiple to decline to 15x, implying another approximately 20% loss by end the year, at 2450. Meanwhile, the data slate was again decent today, with headline GDP unrevised at 2.1% in Q4 (under the bonnet, details weren't so great), while pending homes sales saw an upside surprise.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Evans (non-voter, dove) said looking for real economic impact from the coronavirus is the first thing to be considered, it is too early to tell if its growth forecast will be cut, and that it is going to take some time for the effects to show. Evans has not yet seen data indicating impact from coronavirus on trade flows between China and US, and is looking at whether lending behaviour is impacted, and for the moment, lending seems to be taking place at reasonable levels.</p><p><strong>* US Q4 GDP (S): </strong>Headline GDP in Q4 was unrevised at 2.1%. Oxford economics said that while the data gives the impression of an economy chugging along at a 2.0% growth rate, the underlying details were softer, and the data represents the pre-COVID19 outbreak, suggesting some downside ahead. OxEco notes that around three-quarters of the GDP growth was a result of the temporary collapse in imports, while business investment contracted sharply, and consumers spent more cautiously. \"The most recent three quarters mark the economy’s worst performance since the 2016 slump, and, stripping out trade, inventories and government spending, final sales to domestic purchasers rose only 1.3% – the weakest advance since 2015.\" Meanwhile, the headline PCE and core PCE prices advanced much less than anticipated in Q4, rising 1.3% Y/Y (-0.3ppt) and 1.2% Y/Y (-0.1ppt), with headline inflation stuck at a modest 1.4% Y/Y and core inflation slipped back to 1.6% Y/Y. \"Tightening financial conditions have added a new dimension to the coronavirus outbreak. The economic impact to the US and global economy was believed to be mostly contained last week, but rising volatility, plunging stock prices, and a strengthening dollar will likely exacerbate the economic shock on the US economy.\" In terms of the policy implications, the GDP report is of course backward-looking, and OxEco does not think it will sway the Fed in terms of its assessment of activity and monetary policy, \"but on the margin, downwardly revised inflation, disappointing growth and tightening financial conditions in the wake of the coronavirus will lead to a Fed rate cut in April, or even March, if financial conditions deteriorate materially.\"</p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>Another decent housing data print, with pending home sales surging by 5.0% in January, topping the Street's 3.0% estimate, and reversing December's fall. \"The January rebound confirms our suspicions that the 4.3% December drop was due to seasonal adjustment problems over the holiday,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"still, the very modest net gain over the two months is smaller than we expected, given low and falling mortgage rates and the long period of much warmer-than-usual winter weather.\" Pantheon notes that the data series is noisy, however, the outlook for the housing sector remains very favourable, provided the US does not suffer a serious COVID19 outbreak.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS: </strong>Durable goods orders declined by 0.2% in January, better than the consensus -1.5%. The ex-defence measure was 3.6%, rising from the -2.4%, and the ex-transport measure printed 0.9%, topping the 0.2% consensus. Capital Economics said that durable goods orders were held down last month by a plunge in volatile defence orders, but the surge in underlying capital goods orders and shipments suggests business equipment investment growth is beginning to rebound. \"That's another clear sign the Fed's rate cuts are feeding through to stronger economic growth, but that recovery would be quickly curtailed in the event of a widespread domestic coronavirus outbreak,\" it adds.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Lagarde told the FT that the coronavirus did not currently warrant a monetary policy response from the ECB. ECB's Schnabel said the ECB was \"very worried\" about the COVID-19 and it is raising uncertainty to a large degree, and that if the virus proves to be more persistent, the ECB will not be able to look through it. Meanwhile, she said that price pressures remain subdued, and that medium-term horizon was now longer than had previously been; there was some debate over whether the Bank should look at other survey indicators of inflation expectations, she said. On asset prices, Schnabel thinks asset prices should not be included in inflation measures. On the scope to reduce rates further, Schnabel said that nobody knows where the reversal rate is, and it is not clear if we have reached it. ECB's Holzmann said the coronavirus is no catastrophe for the economy, dramatic correction to the ECB projections is unlikely.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN FISCAL STIMULUS: </strong>German government is considering stimulus programme in case coronavirus hits the economy hard, Handelsblatt reported; the government is mulling various scenarios, and a plan should be ready in a few days. Germany's Economy minister Altmaier, however, said the government was not planning a fiscal plan in the 'classic sense' to deal with the coronavirus, and said he sees only a limited impact of global growth from the virus, but much will depend on how things develop. He will have intense talks with finance minister Scholz regarding pulling forward individual economic measures. At the moment, Altmaier said, there are no major disruptions to orders or to supply chains in Germany, though the government stood ready to adjust size of any financial measures as needed. Altmaier also said the government must discuss measures to reduce tax measures for companies.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK published its negotiating mandate for trade talks with the EU, which were largely in line with expectations. The UK is willing to trade on a no-deal basis with the EU if trade talks fail, and it wants equivalent settlements to be carried out by June. The UK does not want a role for the ECJ in any dispute mechanism, and the UK should not be required to follow EU standards and should not -- in any manner -- constrict tax sovereignty. UK also said that, in line with the EU-Canadian agreement precedent, the deal should recognise the right of each party to set their own labour priorities and adopt or modify tax laws, and any agreement should include reciprocal commitments not to weaken/reduce the level of protection was is provided by labour laws/standards to encourage trade and/or investment. The UK wants streamlined customs arrangements, covering all trade in EU goods, and it will not link access to its fishing waters to access EU markets. Responding, the EU's Brexit negotiator Barnier said negotiations with the UK will be difficult and short, given it is the UK's choice to leave at year-end, while also adding that the equivalence regime for financial services is not part of UK/EU negotiations. Separately, UK Chancellor Sunak has ordered additional set of forecasts from OBR, to be published on 13th March; OBR will have a \"limited\" update on 11th March Budget.</p><p><strong>* AUSSIE CAPEX</strong>: Capex data overnight was expected to rebound in Q4, though declined by 2.8% Q/Q (exp +0.5%). However, analysts were encouraged by the forward-looking measures, with mining capex intentions likely to drive growth this year and next. Nevertheless, non-mining capex intentions augur a contraction in capex in FY 2020, Goldman Sachs said. \"Overall we viewed today's data as soft and lower our 4Q 2019 GDP tracker -10bps to +0.4% Q/Q (due next Wednesday), we note this is broadly in line with the RBA's latest forecasts.\"</p><p><strong>* BOK: </strong>The Bank of Korea kept rates unchanged at 1.25%, against the building expectations of a rate cut. With that said, there were two dovish dissenters calling for a 25bps reduction. The growth projection - a useful indicator in the current coronavirus environment - was trimmed by 0.2ppts to 2.1%, a more benign downgrade than many desks had anticipated, although there is a suggestion it could be lowered again when more information about the virus and its containment are known. The Governor explained the BOK's decision by noting the uncertainty on how long and how bad the virus develops, while also noting some financial stability concerns about the impact of lower rates on the housing market; additionally, the BOK is coordinating with the government on providing micro measures. The governor did however suggest that the Bank's on hold decision was based on the assumption that the impact from the virus does not extend into Q2. Desks suggested that with the BOK in data dependent mode, the case for a rate cut at the April confab will grow, unless the virus becomes contained very quickly<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 1.64 LOWER AT USD 47.09/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 1.08 LOWER USD 51.73/BBL: </strong>WTI and Brent continued to decline amid broader coronavirus concerns and the potential impact on demand. WTI continued its march beneath USD 50/bbl, to lows of 45.88 from highs early in the morning, and Brent briefly fell beneath USD 51/bbl before paring back to above USD 53/bbl. Sources suggested that Saudi Arabia is to cut March oil supply to China by 500k BPD due to the slow demand. On OPEC+, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo noted that there appears to be “renewed commitment” to reaching a deal and that next week’s meeting is to go ahead as expected, and Russia’s Energy Minister Novak noted Russia wants to continue cooperation with Saudi within OPEC+ and bilaterally. Note, analysts at Citi say the recent price action may be helpful in either convincing Russia to accept the 600k BPD cut recommended by the JTC, or for OPEC+ to consider an even larger cut.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 133-14. </strong>It was another choppy session for the TPLEX, which has ultimately seen yields in the shorter part of the curve fall by around 4.5bps, while the longer end was down by just under 1bps, at settlement; the shape of the curve, however, was steeper to the tune of 1-3bps. It was, of course, COVID19 headlines that were dictating the action, and the curve was influencing the FX space via the rate differential channel, which subsequently saw the USD come under pressure, particularly against the JPY. The US sold 7-year notes in an unspectacular auction, which tailed by 1.4bps, though cover had firmed versus recent averages. For now, Fed officials seem to be comfortable monitoring the risks, although markets seem to be somewhat less patient, and have priced in nearly three rate cuts through the end of this year. Analysts have said that whether this transpires on not will likely depend on the speed of the normalisation, and what actions US corporates could take in response (cutting guidance has been seen, but some have warned they may be far more worried by job cuts).</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -4.43%, DJ -4.4% at 25,760, Nasdaq -4.6% at 8566</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>US equities traded heavily in the red once again with weekly losses on track for its worst performance since 2008. Microsoft (MSFT) were hit as it cut its Q3 personal computing segment revenue guidance due to coronavirus, sees supply chain returning to normal operations at a slower pace than previously expected. JP Morgan analyst Mark Murphy highlighted it is not a demand issue and the segment is its least strategic segment, noting all other segment guidance is unchanged. However, RBC note the worst scenario is a possible EPS decline of 21%. PayPal (PYPL) also issued updated guidance, where it expects Q1 revenue towards lower end of its previous guided USD 4.78-4.84bln range as a result of the coronavirus; note competitor Mastercard (MA) also recently cut its guidance. Gilead (GILD) traded higher as it initiated two Phase III studies of investigational antiviral Remdesivir for the treatment of coronavirus, with studies in Asian countries to being in March. Of note for food delivery names (GRUB, UBER) NYC council is considering a package of bills aimed at how much delivery companies can charge restaurants, and elsewhere in the space, DoorDash formally filed draft IPO documents with the SEC.</p><p><strong>*EARNINGS: </strong>Best Buy (BBY) was supported by strong beats on its earnings report, while also reporting solid guidance, gains, however, were capped amid the soured risk sentiment. Booking Holdings (BKNG) reported solid EPS and revenue, although only provided poor guidance.&nbsp; Marriot (MAR) traded firmer from an EPS beat, while noting its guidance does not include the impact of the coronavirus as it cannot fully estimate the nominal amount.&nbsp; Anaplan (PLAN) fell ~20% after forecasting its operating margin to be -17.5 to -18.5%, meanwhile announcing its Chief Growth Officer has stepped down, and it will not be refilling the road. Etsy (ETSY) surged over 10% following a strong earnings beat and optimistic guidance.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong>&nbsp; As US yields were crushed again, rate differentials have moved against the dollar (DXY has settled around 98.50), and to the benefit of the yen (USDJPY back under 110.00). The <strong>EUR</strong> (briefly topping 1.10) has benefitted from shorts continuing to cover, unwinding EMFX carry, while month-end factors were also said to support. <strong>GBP</strong> has been fairly resilient and is closing out the day flat/slightly lower, with month-end factors in EURGBP playing a role, while punchy Brexit rhetoric reminds us how contentious trade talks will be. Activity currency (<strong>AUD, NZD)</strong> are higher, but that is more about the USD than any constructive macro outlook. <strong>EMFX</strong> have endured another torrid session. Commodity FX could not benefit from the dollar downside, with crude sliding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It was, of course, COVID19 headlines that were dictating the action, and the curve was influencing the FX space via the rate differential channel, which subsequently saw the USD come under pressure, particularly against the JPY. The US sold 7-year notes in an unspectacular auction, which tailed by 1.4bps, though cover had firmed versus recent averages. For now, Fed officials seem to be comfortable monitoring the risks, although markets seem to be somewhat less patient, and have priced in nearly three rate cuts through the end of this year. Analysts have said that whether this transpires on not will likely depend on the speed of the normalisation, and what actions US corporates could take in response (cutting guidance has been seen, but some have warned they may be far more worried by job cuts).</p>",

On OPEC+, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo noted that there appears to be “renewed commitment” to reaching a deal and that next week’s meeting is to go ahead as expected, and Russia’s Energy Minister Novak noted Russia wants to continue cooperation with Saudi within OPEC+ and bilaterally.

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Not quite freefall, but a pretty steep and deeper retreat from 99.125 through Fib and chart support just ahead of 98.500 to 98.355 for the Dollar index as the US Treasury curve flipped back to bull-flattening mode amidst an acceleration of risk aversion due to the coronavirus. In sum, the contamination tally and death toll continue to rise, with the outbreak reaching more new countries almost by the day, while a confirmed case in the US was classified as a potential community spread. In the current clime, US data (and other for that matter) hardly even registered, but for the record durable goods and pending home sales beat consensus and the 2nd look at Q4 GDP unrevised vs a modest jobless claims miss.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/AUD/NZD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Euro has gleaned the most momentum from the Greenback’s demise, technical impulses and its primary status as a go to or carry currency when capital is flooding out of EM currencies. Indeed, Eur/Usd reclaimed 1.0900 before scaling a series of resistance levels, an option expiry and more upside chart points on the way to a new multi-week high just above 1.1000. Meanwhile, the Franc rebounded around a big figure vs the Buck around 0.9700, but could not keep pace with the single currency as the Eur/Chf cross breached 1.0650 compared to sub-1.0600 a couple of times recently (before some verbal if not physical SNB intervention). Elsewhere, even the Aussie and Kiwi took advantage of their US counterpart’s misfortune despite clear and officially acknowledged threats to the Antipodean economies from the aforementioned Chinese COVID-19 outbreak, with Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd back up towards 0.6600 and over 0.6325 respectively. Last, but not least in terms of volatility, the Yen straddled 110.00 for the most part and mainly above during EU trade on intermittent nCoV headlines and related fluctuations in sentiment following dovish BoJ commentary and in advance of a host of Japanese data.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona was undermined early on by weaker than expected retail sales, but then sunk to record lows vs the Euro alongside crude prices, in contrast to the Swedish Crown that was propped to a degree by improvements in sentiment indicators and above forecast consumption figures. Meanwhile, Cable and the Pound more generally was rattled by confirmation of a pretty rigid UK mandate for Brexit trade talks, as Cable recoiled from just shy of 1.2950 to circa 1.2860 and Eur/Gbp rose more than 100 pips from around 0.8430 with added impetus via further RHS month end activity. A moderately narrower than anticipated Canadian current account deficit hardly helped the Loonie as the slide in oil kept Usd/Cad in the upper reaches of a 1.3316-74 range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>As noted above, regional currencies have endured a torrid session against the backdrop of heightened China epidemic concerns, but the Lira and Rouble were also pressured by reports of an escalation of military action in Syria, while the Real hit a fresh all time low around 4.5000 and the Mexican Peso depreciated in wake of a rise in unemployment rather than Banxico rhetoric.</p>",

No definitive or easy to pinpoint catalyst, but UK STIRs also eclipsed 3 month counterparts along the way to infer a more dovish BoE spin and/or heightened hard Brexit positioning. Meanwhile, Bunds have not bettered their previous Eurex best like 10 year USTs in the run up to a raft of US data, 7 year supply and Fed speak.</p>",

The Buck’s retreat coincides with a marked rise in the number of suspected US cases and one confirmed in North Carolina from unknown origin that the CDC contends may constitute a community spread. In response, the <strong>DXY</strong> has reversed further below the 99.000 level to a 98.658 low and not far from Fib support at 98.550 that virtually coincides with another strong technical mark in the form of a late November 2019 high. Ahead, multiple US data releases and more Fed rhetoric, but for the time being it’s all about coronavirus and contagion.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/CHF/AUD</strong></p><p>The major beneficiaries of the aforementioned US Dollar demise, with the Euro embarking on a firmer recovery rally through 1.0900, 1.0926 resistance and a 1.0937 Fib before pulling up just ahead of 1.0950, a decent 1.0955 option expiry (1 bn) and another Fib at 1.0958. Meanwhile, the Kiwi and Aussie have both pared losses from sub-0.6300/0.6550 lows even though the RBNZ and NZ Finance Minister have warned of near term downside economic effects from the nCoV, with the former estimating a 0.3% point q/q hit to Q1 GDP, and Australia’s PM expressed concerns about a global pandemic that warrants action. In similar vein, the Franc has shrugged off latest dovish SNB commentary to a certain extent, as Usd/Chf slips closer to 0.9700 in contrast to Eur/Chf remaining above 1.0600 on the relative common currency strength noted above.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Volatile trade for the Yen around 110.00 vs the Greenback and within a 120.56-119.96 range against the Euro, as underlying safe-haven demand alongside dovish BoJ remarks propelled the Japanese unit to best levels before key chart support and psychological levels held. However, a raft of looming Japanese economic indicators should provide some fundamental direction, including CPI, jobs, IP and retail sales.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/GBP/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie is meandering either side of 1.3325 ahead of Canadian current account data and capped by another marked decline in crude, but showing a bit more resilience than the Norwegian Crown that has fallen below 10.2750 vs the Euro in wake of much weaker than forecast retail sales. Conversely, the Swedish Krona has been cushioned by encouraging sentiment indicators and wider trade surplus, with Eur/Sek retreating towards the bottom of 10.6125-5570 extremes. However, Sterling is back under pressure on a combination of bearish factors, as Cable reverses from around 1.2950 to 1.2870 or so and Eur/Gbp tests 0.8500 on heightened no deal Brexit prospects, more month end cross flows and elevated BoE easing expectations rather than actual MPC guidance via Cunliffe.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Losses across the board on broad risk aversion, but with the Try also subject to further Syrian related angst as Russia refutes any meeting in early March and the Lira breaches a key mark (circa 6.1600 vs the Usd) that had been providing a buffer.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> were uneventful for a large part of the session with the former dictated by its base currency, although modest strength was seen flowing into the <strong>Yen</strong> towards the latter part of the APAC session, which prompted <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>EUR/JPY</strong> to test 110.00 and 120.00 to the downside respectively. Finally, <strong>KRW</strong> garnered attention after the BoK surprisingly left its Base Rate unchanged at 1.25%, against rising calls for a 25bps cut – initially instigating gains in the Won. However, a surge in nCoV cases in the country saw the KRW pare back all its BoK-induced gains and reverse course. <strong>USD/KRW</strong> eclipsed 1216 to the upside vs. a BoK low of ~1209.25.</p><p>New Zealand Finance Minister Robertson said the NZ economy is in a strong position to respond to the virus, but it will have a serious impact short-term.

Major curve spreads were boased towards steepening, with 5s30s +6bps as traders wrapped up for the day. Today's auction of 5s was average, which by the standards of Tuesday's 2s auction means it was reasonable; the sale tailed and saw the lowest yield at a 5s auction since September 2016. Tomorrow the US will sell 7s; the 7s sector trades cheap in asset swap versus older 7s, SocGen's analysts observe, though trades fair on the fly against 5s and 10s. SocGen thinks the auction will be expensive on an outright basis, given the WI is trading below all stop-out rates since 2013. The bank notes that the 2s7s curve has flattened meaningfully this year, and that has seen 7s richen on the curve. SocGen says it has a negative bias ahead of the auction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: APAC stocks trade mostly lower whilst KRW seesaws on BoK and virus updates",
        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets trade mostly lower following a mixed Wall Street handover, which saw major bourses fade gains heading into the latter part of the US session before Dow and S&amp;P dipped into negative territory – with the Dow losses tallying to over 2000 points this week thus far. Furthermore, US equity futures trickled lower at the reopen, with each March contract down ~0.5-1% for most of the session, amid the rising virus cases outside China and with the first “community spread” reported in the States. ASX 200 (-0.9%) is mostly weighed on by its banking and base-metal miners, with some earnings-related movers scattered across the index. Nikkei 225 (-1.7%) underperforms with downside led by manufacturing and financials, and with Panasonic shares sliding over 4% after ending its solar partnership with Tesla. KOSPI (-0.8%) continues to be weighed on by the surging number of coronavirus cases in the country alongside the surprise hold on rates by the BoK. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) joined the regional stock rout as the energy and entertainment names add further to the losses seen this week, whilst Shanghai Comp (+0.2%) shows resilience despite yet another PBoC inaction, as the rate of deaths in the country slowed whilst the number of new cases steadied, and with further pledges from China to cushion the virus impact and stem the contagion.</p><p>In FX, DXY trades on either side of 99.000 after the index saw some weakness during US President Trump’s coronavirus presser, which highlighted that a usable vaccine would take 12-18 months to produce, while the President also noted that US GDP could be impacted – G10 pairs largely moved in tandem with the Greenback. EUR/USD briefly topped 1.0900 before stabilising around the figure, while GBP/USD just about reclaimed the 1.2900 handle, with traders on the lookout for PM Johnson unveiling his trade negotiating mandate with the EU, expected to set out a tough stance on fishing rights – one of the key sticking points. Similarly, Antipodeans trade flat and in lockstep with the Dollar, with Kiwi largely side-lining a narrowing annual trade balance deficit as exports fell, whilst the Aussie ignored dismal Private Capex data. AUD/USD fluctuates on either side of 0.6550 ahead of the most recent 11yr low of 0.6542, and NZD/USD found mild support at ~0.6280 which coincides with the Sep 27th and Oct 17th lows from last year. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are uneventful, with the former largely dictated by its base currency. Finally, KRW garners attention after the BoK surprisingly left its Base Rate unchanged at 1.25%, against rising calls for a 25bps cut – initially instigating gains in the Won. However, a surge in South Korean nCoV cases saw the currency pare back all its BoK-induced gains and reverse course. USD/KRW eclipsed 1216 to the upside vs. a BoK low of ~1209.25.</p>",
