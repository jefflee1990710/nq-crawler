The easing of dollar demand was evident in the spot market too, with the DX back below 101. Crude was modestly firmer as participants’ caution on the energy complex remains entrenched. Stocks were generally higher across the board agin on Wednesday, following the largest stock rally in nearly a decade on Tuesday. Supporting further gains were some of the most acute COVID-19 victims as investors prepared for a deluge of fiscal aid from the new stimulus bill, particularly airlines, casinos, hotels and other leisure-related stocks. Boeing (BA) gained nearly one third of its market cap amid it announcing 737 MAX production would continue in May and that a sizeable portion of the stimulus bill would be allocated to it. Facebook (FB) opened lower following it reporting its ad revenue was down since the virus hit, although noted a strong pick up in its Messager services. Nike (NKE) fared better after its earnings report Tuesday evening, where it beat on Revenue, although missed on EPS, while tech underperformed with Apple (AAPL) reportedly considering delaying 5G iPhone by months. SPX +1.26% at 2478, NDX -1.11% at 7470, DJIA +2.39% at 21,201.</p><p>THE TPLEX BULL STEEPENED on Wednesday, likely catching momentum from the short-end, where some Bills crossed into negative rates. With a strong take-up in the Fed’s reverse repo operation, and low overnight collateral rates, dealers have enough cash for the time being, which is potentially pushing them into Bills. Furthermore, the Treasury’s 5-year note auction was well received, stopping through the 0.55% WI by 1.5bps, while covering 2.53x (above the six-auction average of 2.42x), dealers took a larger share than usual, but one desk notes the strong takeup as not a “hot-potato toss”, but rather a desire for the notes, instead of immediately selling them. Meanwhile, the belly to long-end likely saw less of a bid due to the equity rally, as well as the increased corporate supply. By settlement, 3m -6bps at -0.0457%, 2s -4.5bps at 0.332%, 10s +3.5bps at 0.853%, 30s +4.5bps at 1.414%. Spreads: 2s10s +4.4bps at 51bps, 2s30s +6.5bps at 108bps; 3-month FRA-OIS +5bps at 106bps. T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 137-11.</p>",

Analysts said nearly half of that total is to comprise of permanent fiscal transfers to households and firms: Americans will receive USD 1,200 in cash payments (about USD 300bln); loans for small businesses, which convert into grants if firms use them to maintain their payroll (around USD 367bln); there will also be a temporary boost to unemployment insurance, and payments could cover 100% of lost wages for a four month period (could be worth USD 200bln+). There will be USD 150bln for state and local governments. The bill will reportedly ban dividend payments and share buybacks for companies that have taken loans from the government; additionally, the bill will reportedly cap executive pay at companies receiving aid. CNBC reported that the bill does not give payroll tax cuts to employees, only employers, and this payroll tax cut would need to be paid back on a staggered basis in coming years. There was some concern expressed by some Senators that a draft version of the bill would encourage employers to lay off workers rather than retain them, which they later proposed an amendment to fix the error, which could be causing some further delay. Furthermore, Senator Sanders said he will demand restrictions on USD 500bln fund for corporates if the three Republican Senators that expressed their objections to unemployment insurance expansions do not drop them, another stumbling block for lawmakers to overcome. The package also includes USD 50bln of aid to airlines that do not have to be repaid, if airlines do not layoff staff. Hospitals will get USD 130bln of aid. Snippets Senators will vote on the measures likely after market hours on Wednesday. The bill is expected to progress, afterwhich it will be the House's turn. House Speaker Pelosi said that no decision will be made about the timing of a House vote on the bill until it has been thoroughly reviewed, and accoridngly, the House vote will likely take place on Thursday. Looking ahead, Senate Minority Leader Schumer also said that further coronavirus relief will be needed in the months ahead, and lawmakers will monitor progress in the next few weeks to determine what issues have not be resolved.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>US Defense Secretary Esper issued a stop movement order, halting all travel and movement abroad for up to 60 days.<strong> </strong>NY Governor Cuomo said that density controls appear to be working, with hospitalizations doubling every 4.7 days on Tuesday, compared with every 2 days on Sunday.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>EU STIMULUS / CORONABONDS: </strong>Germany said it is open to allowing the activation of the ESM credit line, according to Der Spiegel; not mentioning any joint issuance. Earlier, nine Eurozone nations called for the bloc to issue so-called 'coronabonds' to finance virus responses packages. However. while the notion has wide support, some European countries do not see the need for common issuance since all countries are still able to tap the markets at reasonable rates. such a scheme would also take time to thrash out the technicalities, and does not seem to be a realistic immediate prospect. Europeans will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the proposals. However, Italian PM Conte says Italy is working with the EU on creating joint debt issuance, where more details should be revealed following the European Council teleconference on Thursday. IT was also earlier reported that ECB President Lagarde had requested EZ Finance Ministers issue a one-off coronabond.</p><p><strong>GERMAN STIMULUS: </strong>German lawmakers agreed a EUR 750bln stimulus package, which will see the government taking on new debt for the first time since 2013; parliament will suspend the constitutional 'debt brake' using an exit clause for emergencies, Reuters reported. The measures include debt-financed supplementary budget of EUR 156bln (about EUR 122.5bln of additional spending, and EUR 33.5bln in tax revenues, including EUR 50bln to help small businesses and self-employed; EUR 50bln will be kept asside for unknown fiscal measures to combat the pandemic), as well as a stabilisation fund of EUR 600bln for loans to businesses and direct stakes in companies (EUR 400bln of loan guarantees, EUR 100bln of loans to public sector development bank KfW, which will then make loans to businesses; EUR 100bln to take direct equity stakes in companies). Reports suggested that the sum of new debt represents around 10% of German GDP. Finance minister Scholz said the supplementary budget shows that the government will use all tools we have to tackle the coronavirus, and said it wanted to compensate and minimise our citizens' loss of income. Scholz also pledged to to double the number of beds in intensive care units.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED’S BULLARD </strong>(non-voter, dove) said most disruption will happen in Q2, saying the Fed must plan ahead, not ruling out further Fed action; USD 2trln package is relief, not stimulus. Bullard thinks that, if US plays its cards right and virus progresses as it did in China, Q3 would be a 'transition quarter' where businesses come back online; in Q4 and Q1 2021, US may see 'boom quarters' due to pent-up demand. Bullard said not to focus on economic data, but the plan of execution negotiated among lawmakers. Given the fast nature of the crisis, Bullard suggested any relief should come via existing systems, to ensure no lag in getting help where it is needed. Says simplest way to get loans to Main Street is via banks, and use the Fed's discount window.</p><p><strong>FED’S REVERSE REPO OPERATION</strong> received USD 97.4bln across 28 bidders, which IFR noted as the largest take up in 577 ops, to be precise. The high takeup is being digested as a signal that, for now, delaers have enough cash and are seeing to park it at the Fed.The alleviation of demand for cash is exhibited further in the GC market, where rates lie on the ZLB, seeing minimal takeup in the Fed’s O/N repo operations.</p><p><strong>ECB </strong>is said to be broadly in favour of activating the Draghi-era OMT if needed. Analysts note that use of the ESM's credit line (which could have capacity to lend EUR 410bln) could theoretically open the door to the ECB using its untested OMT programme, potentially with unlimited firepower. A decision will formally take place at Thursday’s European Council meeting.</p><p><strong>ECB'S LAGARDE </strong>asked EZ Finance Ministers on Wednesday to seriously consider a one-off joint debt issue of coronabonds, according to officials. Lagarde suggested that the joint issuance would be on top of the use of the bailout fund. The joint issuance plan was opposed by Northern European nations, however, support did come from beyond southern states.</p><p><strong>ECB'S DE COS</strong> (Spain) sees joint debt (coronabond) as one answer to the crisis, according to Handelsblatt, saying that the ECB should be open to raising the self-imposed limits on bond purchases</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.48 HIGHER AT USD 24.49/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 0.24 HIGHER AT USD 27.39/BBL</strong></p><p><strong>OIL PRICES TRADED CHOPPY ON WEDNESDAY</strong>, reversing overnight gains, before coming off the lows in the latter part of the session. The energy complex remains betweena rock and a hard place with a breakdown of OPEC supply cuts and global demand coming to a stand still. Analysts have been trying to quantify just how far demand will fall, with speculation estimates will be downgraded further to indicate a greater than 10mln BPD (10%) hit to world oil demand. The weekly US energy inventories did little to sway price action; crude stocks built 1.6mln bbls (exp. +2.8mln), the products both printed draws, while production fell by 100k BPD to 13mln BPD. Elsewhere, US Secretary of State Pompeo said that the US and Saudis discussed on Wednesday the need to maintain stability in the energy markets; coming in the context of recent reports that suggested the US has been angling for closer energy cooperation with Saudi Arabia, with some suggesting an alliance between the two (some reports have also suggested US was angling for the Saudis to leave OPEC). Meanwhile, China has been reportedly picking up record volumes of Russian oil amid the supply glut and price declines, according to trading sources.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 137-11.</strong></p><p>THE TPLEX BULL STEEPENED on Wednesday, likely catching momentum from the short-end, where some Bills crossed into negative rates. With a strong take-up in the Fed’s reverse repo operation, and low overnight collateral rates, dealers have enough cash for the time being, which is potentially pushing them into Bills. Furthermore, the Treasury’s 5-year note auction was well received, stopping through the 0.55% WI by 1.5bps, while covering 2.53x (above the six-auction average of 2.42x), dealers took a larger share than usual, but one desk notes the strong takeup as not a “hot-potato toss”, but rather a desire for the notes, instead of immediately selling them. Meanwhile, the belly to long-end likely saw less of a bid due to the equity rally, as well as the increased corporate supply. By settlement, 3m -6bps at -0.0457%, 2s -4.5bps at 0.332%, 10s +3.5bps at 0.853%, 30s +4.5bps at 1.414%. Spreads: 2s10s +4.4bps at 51bps, 2s30s +6.5bps at 108bps; 3-month FRA-OIS +5bps at 106bps.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.26% at 2478, NDX -1.11% at 7470, DJIA +2.39% at 21,201.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Communication Svs -1.59%, Technology -0.28%, Cons Stpl -0.17%, Cons Disc +1.1%, Health +1.27%, Materials +2.2%, Financials +2.66%, Utilities +2.84%, Energy +4.49%, Real Estate +4.49%, Industrials +5.29%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Stocks were generally higher across the board agin on Wednesday, following the largest stock rally in nearly a decade on Tuesday. Supporting further gains were some of the most acute COVID-19 victims as investors prepared for a deluge of fiscal aid from the new stimulus bill, particularly airlines, casinos, hotels and other leisure-related stocks. Boeing (BA) gained nearly one third of its market cap amid it announcing 737 MAX production would continue in May and that a sizeable portion of the stimulus bill would be allocated to it. Facebook (FB) opened lower following it reporting its ad revenue was down since the virus hit, although noted a strong pick up in its Messager services. Nike (NKE) fared better after its earning report Tuesday evening, where it beat on Revenue, although missed on EPS. Gilead (GILD) was offered after it requested to have its orphan designation removed by the FDA. General Motors (GM) is on review for a potential downgrade to junk at Moody's. Apple (AAPL) is considering delaying 5G iPhone by months, Nikkei reported.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>DURABLE GOODS:</strong> Orders were up 1.2% M/M against an expected -0.9%. The value of the release is diminished since it is pre-virus, but desks note that the trend was roughly flat before the virus hit. Pantheon Macroeconomics said we have to expect very steep declines in orders in both March and April, as companies defer all but the most essential capex. \"Q2 is a write-off before it even starts,\" Pantheon writes.</p><p><strong>MBA MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS:</strong> Mortgage applications plunged 29.4% W/W, with sharp declines in both purchases and mortgage refinancing. Oxford Economics explains that the dislocations in financial markets have caused mortgage rates to rise nearly 40 basis points over the last two weeks, with spreads to Treasuries approaching crisis levels. \"The Fed’s stepped-up purchases of MBS have caused secondary market spreads to tighten significantly and we think mortgage rates will decline in the weeks ahead,\" Oxford Economics writes.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>GBP:</strong> It may be quite coincidental, but the first day of the new ONS UK data release regime (7.00GMT instead of the usual 9.30GMT slot) prefaced a manic midweek session for the Pound. In truth, CPI and other inflation metrics were not that influential, if at all market moving, as Cable extended its rebound from recent multi-year lows just above 1.1400 to 1.1975 (eclipsing the 2019 trough along the way) on a mixture of Dollar weakness, chart gap filling and short covering from extreme oversold levels. This also spilled over into Sterling crosses, like Eur/Gbp that recoiled towards 0.9050 at one stage before the whole recovery rally petered out and the Pound came tumbling back down through 1.1700 and 0.9240 respectively to briefly prop up the major ranks having rivalled the Aussie as top performer in early EU trade.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY: </strong>A marked downturn in risk appetite from voracious proportions in the am especially has sapped strength from the Aussie and Kiwi, albeit not to the extent that saw Sterling turn from one of the G10 heroes to zero, as noted above. Nevertheless, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have reversed sharply from circa 0.6070 and 0.5910 to sub-0.5950 and just shy of 0.5800 as the DXY retests its best levels within a 101.920-150 band. In terms of a negative or bearish catalyst, nothing really obvious or new, but the northern faction of the Eurozone appears to be pushing back on the idea of issuing ‘coronabonds’ and some member states are holding back on utilising the ESM, while the US has yet to vote and sign off on the bipartisan stimulus C bill. However, the Yen is not regaining a safe-haven bid amidst more reports about Japanese economic and targeted SME aid, with Usd/Jpy soaking up some supply said to be stacked between 111.50 and 112.00.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF: </strong>The Euro has been hampered by the aforementioned reticence or reluctance to joint debt crisis funding and/or tapping the so far intact ESM pot, not to mention more pronounced Ifo survey deterioration that persuade German parliament to rubber stamp a whopping Eur750 bn support package. Eur/Usd has been capped around 1.0850, but relatively underpinned near 1.0800 in similar vein to Usd/Chf around 0.9800 and Eur/Chf either side of 1.0600 after Swiss investor morale sunk and the Government in conjunction with the SNB rolled out further anti-nCoV measures.</p><p><strong>CAD: </strong>Irrespective of the now customary reverberations in oil and broad sentiment, the Loonie has remained comparatively firm for no obvious or fresh reason as Usd/Cad hovers closer to the base of a 1.4297-1.4482 band, and BoC/Fed (plus other global Central Bank) benchmark rate differentials may be impacting.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM:</strong>The Nok has retained its recent bullish retracement mojo in star contrast to the Sek and EM currencies that have lost momentum amidst the ongoing spread of COVID-19.</p>",

With a strong take-up in the Fed’s reverse repo operation, and low overnight collateral rates, dealers have enough cash for the time being, which is potentially pushing them into Bills. Furthermore, the Treasury’s 5-year note auction was well received, stopping through the 0.55% WI by 1.5bps, while covering 2.53x (above the six-auction average of 2.42x), dealers took a larger share than usual, but one desk notes the strong takeup as not a “hot-potato toss”, but rather a desire for the notes, instead of immediately selling them. Meanwhile, the belly to long-end likely saw less of a bid due to the equity rally, as well as the increased corporate supply. By settlement, 3m -6bps at -0.0457%, 2s -4.5bps at 0.332%, 10s +3.5bps at 0.853%, 30s +4.5bps at 1.414%.

The energy complex remains between a rock and a hard place with a breakdown of OPEC supply cuts and global demand coming to a stand still. Analysts have been trying to quantify just how far demand will fall, with speculation estimates will be downgraded further to indicate a greater than 10mln BPD (10%) hit to world oil demand. The weekly US energy inventories did little to sway price action; crude stocks built 1.6mln bbls (exp. +2.8mln), the products both printed draws, while production fell by 100k BPD to 13mln BPD. Elsewhere, US Secretary of State Pompeo said that the US and Saudis discussed on Wednesday the need to maintain stability in the energy markets; coming in the context of recent reports that suggested the US has been angling for closer energy cooperation with Saudi Arabia, with some suggesting an alliance between the two (some reports have also suggested US was angling for the Saudis to leave OPEC). Meanwhile, China has been reportedly picking up record volumes of Russian oil amid the supply glut and price declines, according to trading sources.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>It may be quite coincidental, but the first day of the new ONS UK data release regime (7.00GMT instead of the usual 9.30GMT slot) prefaced a manic midweek session for the Pound. In truth, CPI and other inflation metrics were not that influential, if at all market moving, as Cable extended its rebound from recent multi-year lows just above 1.1400 to 1.1975 (eclipsing the 2019 trough along the way) on a mixture of Dollar weakness, chart gap filling and short covering from extreme oversold levels. This also spilled over into Sterling crosses, like Eur/Gbp that recoiled towards 0.9050 at one stage before the whole recovery rally petered out and the Pound came tumbling back down through 1.1700 and 0.9240 respectively to briefly prop up the major ranks having rivalled the Aussie as top performer in early EU trade.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>A marked downturn in risk appetite from voracious proportions in the am especially has sapped strength from the Aussie and Kiwi, albeit not to the extent that saw Sterling turn from one of the G10 heroes to zero, as noted above. Nevertheless, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have reversed sharply from circa 0.6070 and 0.5910 to sub-0.5950 and just shy of 0.5800 as the <strong>DXY </strong>retests its best levels within a 101.920-150 band. In terms of a negative or bearish catalyst, nothing really obvious or new, but the northern faction of the Eurozone appears to be pushing back on the idea of issuing ‘coronabonds’ and some member states are holding back on utilising the ESM, while the US has yet to vote and sign off on the bipartisan stimulus C bill.<strong> </strong>However, the Yen is not regaining a safe-haven bid amidst more reports about Japanese economic and targeted SME aid, with Usd/Jpy soaking up some supply said to be stacked between 111.50 and 112.00.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>The Euro has been hampered by the aforementioned reticence or reluctance to joint debt crisis funding and/or tapping the so far intact ESM pot, not to mention more pronounced Ifo survey deterioration that persuade German parliament to rubber stamp a whopping Eur750 bn support package. Eur/Usd has been capped around 1.0850, but relatively underpinned near 1.0800 in similar vein to Usd/Chf around 0.9800 and Eur/Chf either side of 1.0600 after Swiss investor morale sunk and the Government in conjunction with the SNB rolled out further anti-nCoV measures.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Irrespective of the now customary reverberations in oil and broad sentiment, the Loonie has remained comparatively firm for no obvious or fresh reason as Usd/Cad hovers closer to the base of a 1.4297-1.4482 band, and BoC/Fed (plus other global Central Bank) benchmark rate differentials may be impacting.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Nok has retained its recent bullish retracement mojo in star contrast to the Sek and EM currencies that have lost momentum amidst the ongoing spread of COVID-19.</p>",

The bank notes that 2s5s curve has steepened since the last 5y auction. \"This cheapness on curve might entice some relative-value seekers towards the 5y auction,\" and observes that the current when-issued yield for the sector is well below all stop-yields on record. \"The current set-up of the 5y auction at record low yields is likely to negatively affect demand. Relatively low dealer holdings in the 3-6y sector are expected to benefit the auction takedown, as a lighter book will likely enhance the ability of dealers to absorb more supply,\" SocGen says, adding, \"any build-up of concession before the auction will also help the auction takedown.\"</p>",

Other analysts noted that the downside may have been due to profit-taking after Tuesday's rally</p><p><strong>CASH OPEN: </strong>Cash markets saw some modest negative ticks at the open, though did minutes afterwards reverse its leg lower. Gains are being led by energy and industrials; on the other side of the coin, consumer staples and health care underperforming (though relatively flat). In terms of company specifics, Apple (AAPL) +3.1% after Digitimes reported it is accelerating its production relocation out of China, moving some production to India; Boeing (BA) up over 20% as it looks to restart the 737 MAX output by May, and has requested suppliers to begin shipping parts in April, according to sources. Nike (NKE) up over 7% after earnings. Additionally, some of the names that have been hammered by the virus crisis are seeing some upside (airliner AAL, and casino group WYNN are both among the top performers).</p><p><strong>LOOKING-AHEAD: </strong>progress on the passage of the US stimulus bill is a key driver, from a macro perspective. Additionally, details about Europe's response (ESM liquidity lines) will also be key ahead of a Eurogroup meeting on Thursday.

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+3.8%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+2.2%)</strong> benefitted from the heightened global risk tone and amid reports the Trump administration is said to mull a 90-day deferral of tariffs on all imported goods from around the world, although the gains were somewhat capped as White House Trade Adviser Navarro refuted the prospects of a tariff deferral and following continued PBoC liquidity inaction.

Focus remains on the States after Senators agreed to the Trump administration’s virus rescue bill – which sources note could be worth USD 2.5tln, and with voting to take place later today although details remain light. Back to Europe, the positive sentiment initally resonated across the region, with Germany’s DAX (-2.2%) reclaiming the 10k milestone. However, the 10k level was conceded therafter alongside reports that ECB’s Lagarde asked EZ Finance Ministers yesterday to seriously consider a one-off joint debt issue of coronabonds; a request that was rejected by northern European nation, however, support came from beyond just the southern states. UK’s FTSE (-1.0%) initially underperformed the region before later receiving a boost due to its large financial, mining and energy exposures. European sectors now mostly red, with the exception of Energy names. Airlines experience a bout of reprieve – potentially on back of the anticipated US stimulus package support for domestic carriers acting as a catalyst; easyJet (+8.7%), Ryanair (+1.5%), and Air France-KLM (+5.7%) all trade closer to the top of the Stoxx 600. Elsewhere, E.ON (+9.2%) was bolstered at the open amid YY improvements in results and underlying utility demand from nations working from home. Finally, Adidas (+3.4%), Puma (+5.6%) and Sports Direct (+10.0%) all see tailwinds emanating from Nike earnings – whose shares show gains in excess of 12% pre-market. In terms of bank calls, UBS sees Stoxx 600 index at 340 by year-end and sees a greater upside in UK equities amid cheaper valuations. The Swiss Bank targets FTSE 100 at 6400. As earning season looms, UBS sees European companies reporting a 33% drop in 2020 EPS, with the expectations incorporating a deep recession forecast.</p><h2>FX</h2><p><strong>AUD/GBP/NZD/CAD/EUR -</strong> The Aussie has extended recovery gains vs its US counterpart and outperformance against most G10 peers amidst another broad upturn in risk sentiment or sheer relief that the US Senate has resolved differences on the circa Usd2 tn Stimulus C bill, including Usd400 bn for the TSF that can be multiplied up to 10 times by the Fed. Aud/Usd has now breached the psychological 0.6000 mark on the way through 0.6050 as Aud/Nzd approaches 1.0300 and the Kiwi meets some resistance around 0.5900 in wake of NZ declaring a state of emergency due to COVID-19. Meanwhile, corrective trade and short covering has carried Cable up beyond 1.1900 and over last year’s 1.1959 low, with Eur/Gbp retreating well below 0.9100 as the single currency stumbles into 1.0850 vs the Greenback in wake of more pronounced weakness in Germany’s final Ifo survey compared to preliminary prints. However, Eur/Usd appears well supported above 1.0800 where decent option expiries roll off (1.2 bn), and with the DXY slipping back from 101.920 to 101.150 within a slightly wider 102.000-101.00 range. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also taking advantage of relative weakness in the Buck, but losing impetus alongside WTI between 1.4297-1.4482 parameters.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY -</strong> The Franc and Yen are narrowly mixed against the US Dollar either side of 0.9800 and 111.00 respectively, but the former holding up better despite waning risk appetite and a sharp deterioration in Swiss investor sentiment.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> The Norwegian and Swedish Crowns are still in bear retracement mode with Eur/Nok sub-12.0000 and Eur/Sek under 11.0000, while EM currencies are also benefiting from less acute angst over the adverse impact of the coronavirus, for the time being at least as global Central Banks and Governments expend even more efforts to counteract the economic contagion.</p><p>New Zealand Trade Balance (Feb) 594M (Prev. -340.0M, Rev. -414M). (Newswires) New Zealand Exports (Feb) 4.92B (Prev. 4.73B, Rev. 4.69B) New Zealand Imports (Feb) 4.33B (Prev. 5.07B, Rev. 5.10B)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>A rather abrupt change in direction, albeit nothing compared to the wild swings in sentiment and related market moves seen since the spread of China’s pandemic beyond the country across the globe. Nevertheless, equity gains have eroded more rapidly in recent trade and debt futures have pared declines to the extent that Gilts have registered a fresh Liffe high (135.07 vs 134.33 at one stage), Bunds are back in positive terrain above 170.00 compared to their 169.54 Eurex low and 10 year US Treasuries are close to flat again within 137-01 to 137-17+ overnight session extremes. Hence, an element of safe-haven positioning has resurfaced and it could be due to the latest nCoV update from Spain or more Eurozone disagreement on concerted fiscal support to counter the virus.</p><h2>COMMODITIES</h2><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front-month futures continued their sentiment-driven climb off near-multi-decade lows, before paring gains amid a broader pullback in sentiment in recent trade. Desks continue to highlight that underlying fundamentals remain largely unchanged, but stimulus hopes provide support for the complex, in the short term at least. Although data has been overshadowed, last night’s Private Inventory data was seemingly constructive for the market – having printed a surprise draw of 1.2mln barrels vs. Exp. build of 2.8mln - traders will now eye the DoE figures for confirmation. That being said, the inventory numbers later today are unlikely to have a sustained impact in prices as the complex takes its cue from macro themes/sentiment. In terms of metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> trades on either side of USD 1600/oz and re-eyes its 21 DMA to the downside at ~USD 1591.90, with losses seemingly triggered due to increasing flows into riskier assets. <strong>Copper </strong>prices initially conformed to the risk appetite but have since waned off highs, with relatively uneventful price action in the red metal below 2.25/lb.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks -1.2mln vs. Exp. +2.8mln (prev. -0.4mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>CME raised COMEX copper futures margins by 17.2% to USD 3750/contract from USD 3200/contract, while it is to launch a new gold futures contract with expanded, flexible delivery in 100 ounces, 400 ounce or 1 kilo bars.

Focus remains on the States after Senators agreed to the Trump administration’s virus rescue bill – which sources note could be worth USD 2.5tln, and with voting to take place later today although details remain light. Back to Europe, the positive sentiment initally resonated across the region, with Germany’s DAX (-2.2%) reclaiming the 10k milestone. However, the 10k level was conceded therafter alongside reports that ECB’s Lagarde asked EZ Finance Ministers yesterday to seriously consider a one-off joint debt issue of coronabonds; a request that was rejected by northern European nation, however, support came from beyond just the southern states. UK’s FTSE (-1.0%) initially underperformed the region before later receiving a boost due to its large financial, mining and energy exposures. European sectors now mostly red, with the exception of Energy names. Airlines experience a bout of reprieve – potentially on back of the anticipated US stimulus package support for domestic carriers acting as a catalyst; easyJet (+8.7%), Ryanair (+1.5%), and Air France-KLM (+5.7%) all trade closer to the top of the Stoxx 600. Elsewhere, E.ON (+9.2%) was bolstered at the open amid YY improvements in results and underlying utility demand from nations working from home. Finally, Adidas (+3.4%), Puma (+5.6%) and Sports Direct (+10.0%) all see tailwinds emanating from Nike earnings – whose shares show gains in excess of 12% pre-market. In terms of bank calls, UBS sees Stoxx 600 index at 340 by year-end and sees a greater upside in UK equities amid cheaper valuations. The Swiss Bank targets FTSE 100 at 6400.

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/GBP/NZD/CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>The Aussie has extended recovery gains vs its US counterpart and outperformance against most G10 peers amidst another broad upturn in risk sentiment or sheer relief that the US Senate has resolved differences on the circa Usd2 tn Stimulus C bill, including Usd400 bn for the TSF that can be multiplied up to 10 times by the Fed. Aud/Usd has now breached the psychological 0.6000 mark on the way through 0.6050 as Aud/Nzd approaches 1.0300 and the Kiwi meets some resistance around 0.5900 in wake of NZ declaring a state of emergency due to COVID-19. Meanwhile, corrective trade and short covering has carried Cable up beyond 1.1900 and over last year’s 1.1959 low, with Eur/Gbp retreating well below 0.9100 as the single currency stumbles into 1.0850 vs the Greenback in wake of more pronounced weakness in Germany’s final Ifo survey compared to preliminary prints. However, Eur/Usd appears well supported above 1.0800 where decent option expiries roll off (1.2 bn), and with the <strong>DXY</strong> slipping back from 101.920 to 101.150 within a slightly wider 102.000-101.00 range. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also taking advantage of relative weakness in the Buck, but losing impetus alongside WTI between 1.4297-1.4482 parameters.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc and Yen are narrowly mixed against the US Dollar either side of 0.9800 and 111.00 respectively, but the former holding up better despite waning risk appetite and a sharp deterioration in Swiss investor sentiment.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Norwegian and Swedish Crowns are still in bear retracement mode with Eur/Nok sub-12.0000 and Eur/Sek under 11.0000, while EM currencies are also benefiting from less acute angst over the adverse impact of the coronavirus, for the time being at least as global Central Banks and Governments expend even more efforts to counteract the economic contagion.</p>",

The recent fluctuations in the greenback dictated the price action for its major counterparts as <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly reclaimed the 1.0800 handle to the upside and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> breaking through the prior day’s resistance around 1.1800. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> initially slipped below 111.00 due to the softer <strong>USD</strong> but then recovered as risk appetite received a second wind on the US coronavirus stimulus bill agreement, while antipodeans were initially indecisive with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> muted by a lack of data and with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> kept lacklustre as the mostly improved trade data was offset amid the RBNZ’s first-ever QE operation and the government’s national emergency declaration.

In addition, the latest private inventory report was also constructive for prices as it showed a surprise draw of 1.2mln bbls. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was choppy and gave back some of the prior day’s gains due to the heightened risk appetite, while copper prices failed to benefit from the rally in stocks and instead kept rangebound near the USD 2.20/lb level.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks -1.2mln vs. Exp. +2.8mln (prev. -0.4mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>CME raised COMEX copper futures margins by 17.2% to USD 3750/contract from USD 3200/contract, while it is to launch a new gold futures contract with expanded, flexible delivery in 100 ounces, 400 ounce or 1 kilo bars.

The market is expecting Congress to come together on a stimulus package, which has supported risk appetite on Tuesday, as well as increasing the certainty of a deluge of supply for government bond investors to digest. The Fed continues to be an active participant across the curve, providing some support in afternoon trade with its Treasury and MBS purchases post its “QE Infinity” announcement on Monday.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets trade with firm gains as the region takes impetus from the historic rally on Wall St where the DJIA jumped by over 2100 points or around 11.4% for its largest daily point gain on record and biggest percentage jump since 1933, with sentiment underpinned by hopes of a stimulus breakthrough and with US President Trump touting a reopen of the US economy by Easter. ASX 200 (+2.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+5.7%) surged as the stellar performance stateside reverberated across the region with Real Estate, Industrials and Financials front-running the gains in Australia which briefly saw the local benchmark notch its biggest intraday gain since October 2008, while Japanese stocks were lifted by the recent JPY-weakness and with the BoJ Summary of Opinions from last week’s emergency meeting suggesting the central bank was flexible and open to another off-schedule meeting. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) benefitted from the heightened global risk tone and amid reports the Trump administration is said to mull a 90-day deferral of tariffs on all imported goods from around the world, but with gains in the mainland somewhat limited following continued PBoC liquidity inaction.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is softer overnight although remains tightly centred to within the prior day’s range circa 101.00-102.00 as markets await a breakthrough on the coronavirus stimulus bill which was described to be close and at the 2-yard line, although has yet to materialize. The recent fluctuations in the greenback dictated the price action for its major counterparts with EUR/USD reclaiming the 1.0800 handle to the upside and with GBP/USD breaking through the prior day’s resistance around 1.1800. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped below 111.00 due to the softer USD and JPY-crosses have also given back some of their risk-fuelled gains, while antipodeans are indecisive as AUD/USD is muted by a lack of fresh data or catalysts and with NZD/USD kept lacklustre as the mostly improved trade data was offset amid the RBNZ’s first-ever QE operation and the government’s national emergency declaration.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat with demand subdued by gains in stocks and in the absence of BoJ purchases in the market today, although downside is also stemmed as prices find a base at the 152.00 level.</p>",
