Apple also unveiled: a new gaming service Apple Arcade, weighing on competitors (ATVI, EA); a new payment service “Apple Card” in collaboration with Goldman (GS) and Mastercard (MA); Apple News service for USD 9.99/month. Viacom (VIAB) and Discovery (DISCA) surged on Monday’s open after Viacom came to a licensing agreement with AT&amp;T (T) for airing its channels. Biogen (BIIB) opened higher on the announcement of a USD 5bln share repurchase programme. Consumer discretionary had a leading day, with retailers (M, KSS, CAG, FL, JWN) leading, Deutsche Bank research notes it as its 10th best day vs. the market in the past year. Akamai (AKAM) nosedived on a downgrade at Deutsche Bank, Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) also suffered from downgrades at Bernstein. TechnipFMC (FTI) traded higher after receiving a large contract in Indonesia from Eni. Boeing (BA) drifted higher in the midst of it arranging a presentation for its new safety and software updates, also Cowen mentioned it positively. Chipmakers were an underperforming sector today wit the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), Micron (MU) and Intel (INTC) all lower. Phillip Morris (PM) opened in the red after cutting its FY EPS guidance lower as one of its Canadian subsidiaries enters bankruptcy filing. Tesla (TSLA) underperformed on the back of an NYT report of data showing a slowdown of new Tesla vehicles on roads as well as RBC cutting its price target on the Co. SPX -0.08% at 2798, NDX -0.12% at 7317, DJI +0.06%.</p><p>The Treasury complex saw another bout of bull-flattening, with the 3m/10yr spread inverting further to -7bps at one point in US trade, which put the equity complex on the defensive (analysts at Nomura have suggested this could explain some of the price action late on Friday); during that episode, 10-year yields also fell below the effective Fed Funds Rate (at 2.41%), and markets were pricing around a 75% chance that the Fed would CUT rates this year (it was 25% before the FOMC meeting last week). Today's moves - like Friday's - are being attributed to the FOMC dovishness, which is likely to be echoed in Fedspeak through the course of the week. There has been heightened attention on its implications, and specifically, what it portends for the future performance of the US economy, given that the 3m/10y part of the curve inverted aead of recessions in 2007/09, 2001, and the 1990/1 recession; it also inverted in 1998 slightly, and at the end of 1995 though the economy continued to grow. Traders have been passing around the SF Fed's analysis on yield curve spreads, penned last August, which concluded that \"the traditional 10y–3m spread is the most reliable predictor (of recession), and we do not find any evidence that would support discarding this long-standing benchmark as a measure of the shape of the yield curve. It is worth emphasizing again, however, that all of these term spreads are fairly accurate predictors and quite informative about future recession risk.\" The SF followed-up with an analysis in February, where it said the shape of the curve was \"worrisome,\" but concluded then that it needed to see a clear inversion of the curve, and it was too early to predict a recession then. SocGen's strategists think that we will see a US recession in 2020, in what it describes as \"a hangover that will follow the excesses of the fiscal package and the damage done by US trade policy.\" But that view is not consensus; ING does not see a US recession either this year or next given the still solid US economy. \"Rather, we view the trend of global curve flattening as natural at the current stage of the cycle, in line with a gradual economic slowdown rather than pencilling an imminent recession\". US T-note futures (M9) settled 9+ ticks higher at 124-10+.</p>",

He said risks to the downside are larger than those to the upside, and rates would have to be on hold or cut if the data disappointed. Evans wants to see more inflation and does not expect a rate hike till H2 2020, but said he would act if inflation undershoots. Evans said the recent US data has been softer than expected.

The Letwin amendment, which seeks to change the rules of parliament on March 27 in order to provide time for lawmakers to debate and hold indicative votes, appears to be gaining the most traction, with a similar vote having lost by just two votes previously this month; the government has said it will whip MPs to vote against the amendment, whilst opposition Labour has said it will vote in favour. However, heading into the evening in London, journalist reports indicated that the amendment was lining up to be rejected, where it had previously been expected to pass. Tuesday is marked down as a potential date for a third meaningful vote by PM May, although May has withdrawn the vote as it stands saying that the vote will only be held if enough parliamentary support is evident; the government said it recognises there is no necessity to have the vote before March 29th, which will be after the EU summit.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 0.22 LOWER AT USD 58.82/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.18 HIGHER AT USD 67.21/BBL. </strong>Oil prices traded rather choppy to kick off the week, with WTI little changed on settlement amidst a combination of bullish and bearish talking points. The latest calculation showed Chinese imports of US crude falling 91% in February to approximately 22k BPD, compared to the prior year, highlighting the cut-off in demand from China for US crude. The market also remains cognizant of weak PMIs released Friday, despite a decent Ifo survey out of Germany today, which showed the first increase in six months. In supply news flow: South Korea and the US are to discuss extensions of Iranian sanction waivers this week; Exxon Baytown Texas refinery (584k BPD) plans to restart its large crude unit this week. Elsewhere, Positioning data of the week till March 19th showed hedge funds buying an additional 65mln bbls of oil futures and options, with net buyers of WTI, Brent and US gasoline, a firm bullish indication; this one week increase in net longs is the largest since the end of August 2018.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.08% at 2798, NDX -0.12% at 7317, DJI +0.06% at 25517.

Apple also unveiled: a new gaming service Apple Arcade, weighing on competitors (ATVI, EA); a new payment service “Apple Card” in collaboration with Goldman (GS) and Mastercard (MA); Apple News service for USD 9.99/month. Viacom (VIAB) and Discovery (DISCA) surged on Monday’s open after Viacom came to a licensing agreement with AT&amp;T (T) for airing its channels. Biogen (BIIB) opened higher on the announcement of a USD 5bln share repurchase programme.

Today's moves - like Friday's - are being attributed to the FOMC dovishness, which is likely to be echoed in Fedspeak through the course of the week. There has been heightened attention on its implications, and specifically, what it portends for the future performance of the US economy, given that the 3m/10y part of the curve inverted aead of recessions in 2007/09, 2001, and the 1990/1 recession; it also inverted in 1998 slightly, and at the end of 1995 though the economy continued to grow. Traders have been passing around the SF Fed's analysis on yield curve spreads, penned last August, which concluded that \"the traditional 10y–3m spread is the most reliable predictor (of recession), and we do not find any evidence that would support discarding this long-standing benchmark as a measure of the shape of the yield curve. It is worth emphasizing again, however, that all of these term spreads are fairly accurate predictors and quite informative about future recession risk.\" The SF followed-up with an analysis in February, where it said the shape of the curve was \"worrisome,\" but concluded then that it needed to see a clear inversion of the curve, and it was too early to predict a recession then. SocGen's strategists think that we will see a US recession in 2020, in what it describes as \"a hangover that will follow the excesses of the fiscal package and the damage done by US trade policy.\" But that view is not consensus; ING does not see a US recession either this year or next given the still solid US economy. \"Rather, we view the trend of global curve flattening as natural at the current stage of the cycle, in line with a gradual economic slowdown rather than pencilling an imminent recession.\"</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 131bln in 2yr (USD 40bln Tue), 5yr (USD 41bln, Wed), 7yr USD 32bln, Thu), and an FRN (USD 18bln, Wed). USD&nbsp; 71.5bln matured at the month-end settlement, implying the Treasury will raise a net USD 59.5bln in new supply. USD 22.4bln of Fed holdings mature at the month-end settlement, and the Fed will add-on USD 7.9bln to 2yr, USD 8.1bln to 5yr, and USD 6.3bln to 7yr. Last week's FOMC meeting was more dovish than anticipated, with the Fed announcing that it will slow the balance sheet run-off in May, ending in September, and reducing caps on monthly redemptions to USD 15bln, from USD 30bln; it will also be reinvesting MBS coupons back into Treasuries. \"With runoff ending in September, we think that Treasury will likely cut coupon auction sizes later this year (potentially focused in the 2-3y sector). Runoff ending in September will decrease Treasury issuance by about $100bn compared with runoff continuing throughout the year,\" TD Securities says. \"The Fed will have to reinvest MBS paydowns in the open market starting in October. Starting in Q4 2020, we look for the Fed to purchase additional Treasuries in the open market to offset the growth in currency in circulation.\" The last auction saw demand ease a touch, though the auction saw a second consecutive stop through the screens. \"Four of the last five auctions have stopped through underscoring the recent strength in performance,\" Barclays writes, \"after the December auction tailed amid elevated market volatility and balance sheet pressures toward the end of 2018.\" Indirect takedown fell at the last auction, however, likely on the back of the decline in domestic investor takedown, while foreign investors have been steadily taking down less over the last four auctions. Some desks also argue that with BCN ending later this year, as well as the potential for the Treasury to cut sizes in the 2-3yr sectors, 2s might begin to trade between against OIS. Looking ahead, Barclays says that \"at a current yields, the WI issue is a potential CTD in TUM9, assuming a 2.375% coupon. However, yields are at the cusp of a coupon shift. If yields decline and the coupon shifts to 2.25%, a seasoned 7y note (2.25s of Mar 21s) will be reopened. Six auction averages: High-yield 2.711%, cover 2.52x, tail 0.2bps; dealers&nbsp; 39.6%, directs 14.7%, indirects 45.7%.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The FX landscape certainly hints at risk-on (the 'risk-on' currencies are AUD and NZD, EMFX is up, USD is soft). However, that backdrop doesn't seem consistent with other asset classes. Equities, for instance, has seen some very choppy trade, though has been contained by key moving averages/VWAP levels, crude is mixed, and Treasuries have bull-flattened further. In fact, it was telling that as the short-end of the curve saw yields drop, USDJPY remained quite stable. The risk environment will no doubt be tested more forcefully over the course of the week, with a huge amount of Fedspeak, supply, ongoing trade talks, and the ominous inversion of the yield curve.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The yen gained on risk aversion; overnight, risk assets took their cues from Friday's late sell-off in risk assets in the US. In early trade, the pair was magnetic to the 110.00 area, where chunky option expiries rolled-off at the NY ct; but the pair continued to linger around that area as US trade progressed. Some were also surprised that US short-end yields gyrated so aggressively, though USDJPY remained stable in afternoon trade. Overnight, BoJ Governor Kuroda said that during a future policy exit, BoJ earnings will decline, but yields should also rise which will raise BoJ bond earnings. The governor added that even if long-term rates were to increase in the future, reflecting economic improvement, pace of any increase will be gradual. BOJ Board Member Harada. BoJ's Harada said that the biggest contribution to Japan's economy from QQE was to boost productivity, and without it the jobless rate would not have fallen below 2.5%. Coming up in the Asia session, the BOJ will release its latest Summary of Opinions; it held rates at the March meeting, UBS' economists think the path to policy normalisation is becoming clearer, arguing that a slew of important signals between now and the April meeting, including the April Tankan survey, will be crucial for board members in evaluating the outlook.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Germany's Ifo survey beat to the upside, and offered some relief after dreadful PMI data on Friday. the Ifo was driven by the expectations component rising to a three-month high. The details, however, chime with the PMI data, Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"the headline manufacturing sentiment index slid further, while confidence in services, construction and wholesale trade rose,\" adding that \"overall, the IFO continues to signal a further slowdown in GDP growth in Q1, but the headlines confirm the story that manufacturing is in the grips of a recession, while the rest of the economy is stabilising, or even improving slightly, towards the end of Q1.</p><p><strong>* RISK-ON FX:</strong> Even when risk sentiment was soft in the early part of the session, the Antipodes NZD, AUD (and particularly AUDJPY) traded firm, threatening a positive turnaround in the risk backdrop. For the former, RBNZ is the focus on Wednesday, while for the latter, RBA speak over the next few days (both asst governors Kent and Ellis). Nevertheless, given that risk sentiment is fragile, there could be only limited upside - especially with the RBA expected to dovish pivot in 2019.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> On the weekend, Turkish President Erdogan said that TRY sellers will pay \"a very heavy price\" following the 5% slide on Friday. However, the currency could face further pressure in the weeks ahead, Nordea argues, and offers seven reasons why. 1) Turkey is in a recession, and high rates have lead to a credit crunch. 2) There are risks that the CBRT could EASE policy now that inflation is coming in. 3) Geopolitical risks linger ahead of the 31 March local elections (Erdogan warned Trump about Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, seeing the TRY weaken). 4) USD is still strong, and given Turkey's high USD funding, could make it expensive to service this debt. 5) FX reserves fell in March beneath the IMF's recommendations, limited the CBRT's ability to intervene in FX. 6) German PMIs have signalled challenges ahead, which could weigh on demand for Turkish exports. 7) The recent inversion of the Treasury curve 3m/10y could contribute further to risk-off.</p><p><strong>* MXN:</strong> The Mexican IGAE economic activity indicator printed 1.3% YY, driven by services activity, beating the consensus 1.1%, and up from the 0.0% in December. The data offers some hope that there may be light for the Mexican economy, following the domestic and international challenges seen in Q4. Most of the drag on growth stems from the oil industry, which offset resilience in services, construction and manufacturing. Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks that the Mex economy will continue to expand at a healthy clip, citing market-friendly policies from the new Administration, which could help stabilise capex. Strength in the US economy may also offer support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, that backdrop doesn't seem consistent with other asset classes. Equities, for instance, has seen some very choppy trade, though has been contained by key moving averages/VWAP levels, crude is mixed, and Treasuries have bull-flattened further. In fact, it was telling that as the short-end of the curve saw yields drop, USDJPY remained quite stable. The risk environement will no doubt be tested more forcefully over the course of the week, with a huge amount of Fedspeak, supply, ongoing trade talks, and the ominous inversion of the yield curve.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The yen gained on risk aversion; overnight, risk assets took their cues from Friday's late sell-off in risk assets in the US. In early trade, the pair was magnetic to the 110.00 area, where chunky option expiries rolled-off at the NY ct; but the pair continued to linger around that area as US trade progressed. Some were also surprised that US short-end yields gyrated so aggressively, though USDJPY remained stable in afternoon trade. Overnight, BoJ Governor Kuroda said that during a future policy exit, BoJ earnings will decline, but yields should also rise which will raise BoJ bond earnings. The governor added that even if long-term rates were to increase in the future, reflecting economic improvement, pace of any increase will be gradual. BOJ Board Member Harada. BoJ's Harada said that the biggest contribution to Japan's economy from QQE was to boost productivity, and without it the jobless rate would not have fallen below 2.5%. Coming up in the Asia session, the BOJ will release its latest Summary of Opinions; it held rates at the March meeting, UBS' economists think the path to policy normalisation is becoming clearer, arguing that a slew of important signals between now and the April meeting, including the April Tankan survey, will be crucial for board members in evaluating the outlook.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Germany's Ifo survey beat to the upside, and offered some relief after dreadful PMI data on Friday. the Ifo was driven by the expectations component rising to a three-month high. The details, however, chime with the PMI data, Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"the headline manufacturing sentiment index slid further, while confidence in services, construction and wholesale trade rose,\" adding that \"overall, the IFO continues to signal a further slowdown in GDP growth in Q1, but the headlines confirm the story that manufacturing is in the grips of a recession, while the rest of the economy is stabilising, or even improving slightly, towards the end of Q1.</p><p><strong>* RISK-ON FX: </strong>Even when risk sentiment was soft in the early part of the session, the Antipodes NZD, AUD (and particularly AUDJPY) traded firm, threateneing a positive turnaround in the risk backdrop. For the former, RBNZ is the focus on Wednesday, while for the latter, RBA speak over the next few days (both asst governors Kent and Ellis). Nevertheless, given that risk sentiment is fragile, there could be only limited upside - especially with the RBA expected to dovish pivot in 2019.</p><p><strong>* TRY: </strong>On the weekend, Turkish President Erdogan said that TRY sellers will pay \"a very heavy price\" following the 5% slide on Friday. However, the currency could face further pressure in the weeks ahead, Nordea argues, and offers seven reasons why. 1) Turkey is in a recession, and high rates have lead to a credit crunch. 2) There are risks that the CBRT could EASE policy now that inflation is coming in. 3) Geopolitical risks linger ahead of the 31 March local elections (Erdogan warned Trump about Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, seeing the TRY weaken). 4) USD is still strong, and given Turkey's high USD funding, could make it expensive to service this debt. 5) FX reserves fell in March beneath the IMF's recommendations, limited the CBRT's ability to intervene in FX. 6) German PMIs have signalled challenges ahead, which could weigh on demand for Turkish exports. 7) The recent inversion of the Treasury curve 3m/10y could contribute further to risk-off.</p><p><strong>* MXN: </strong>The Mexican IGAE economic activity indicator printed 1.3% YY, driven by services activity, beating the consensus 1.1%, and up from the 0.0% in December. The data offers some hope that there may be light for the Mexican economy, following the domestic and international challenges seen in Q4. Most of the drag on growth stems from the oil industyr, which offset resilience in services, construction and manufacturing. Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks that the Mex economy will continue to expand at a healthy clip, citing market-friendly policies from the new Administration, which could help stabilise capex. Strength in the US economy may also offer support.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The Treasury complex saw another bout of bull-flattening, with the 3m/10yr spread inverting further to -7bps at one point in US trade, which put the equity complex on the defensive (analysts at Nomura have suggested this could explain some of the price action late on Friday); during that episode, 10-year yields also fell below the effective Fed Funds Rate (at 2.41%), and markets were pricing around a 75% chance that the Fed would CUT rates this year (it was 25% before the FOMC meeting last week). Today's moves - like Friday's - are being attributedto the FOMC dovishness, which is likely to be echoed in Fedspeak through the course of the week. There has been heightened attention on its implications, and specifically, what it portends for the future performance of the US economy, given that the 3m/10y part of the curve inverted aead of recessions in 2007/09, 2001, and the 1990/1 recession; it also inverted in 1998 slightly, and at the end of 1995 though the economy continued to grow. Traders have been passing around the SF Fed's analysis on yield curve spreads, penned last August, which concluded that \"the traditional 10y–3m spread is the most reliable predictor (of recession), and we do not find any evidence that would support discarding this long-standing benchmark as a measure of the shape of the yield curve. It is worth emphasizing again, however, that all of these term spreads are fairly accurate predictors and quite informative about future recession risk.\" The SF followd-up with an analysis in February, where it said the shape of the curve was \"worrisome,\" but concluded then that it needed to see a clear inversion of the curve, and it was too early to predict a recession then. SocGen's strategists think that we will see a US recession in 2020, in what it descrives as \"a hangover that will follow the excesses of the fiscal package and the damage done by US trade policy.\" But that view is not consensus; ING does not see a US recession either this year or next given the still solid US economy. \"Rather, we view the trend of global curve flattening as natural at the current stage of the cycle, in line with a gradual economic slowdown rather than pencilling an imminent recession.\"</p>",

The latest calculation showed Chinese imports of US crude falling 91% in February to approximately 22k BPD, compared to the prior year, highlighting the cut-off in demand from China for US crude. The market also remains cognizant of weak PMIs released Friday, despite a decent Ifo survey out of Germany today, which showed the first increase in six months. In supply news flow: South Korea and the US are to discuss extensions of Iranian sanction waivers this week; Exxon Baytown Texas refinery (584k BPD) plans to restart its large crude unit this week. Elsewhere, Positioning data of the week till March 19th showed hedge funds buying an additional 65mln bbls of oil futures and options, with net buyers of WTI, Brent and US gasoline, a firm bullish indication; this one week increase in net longs is the largest since the end of August 2018.</p>",

        "content": "<p>On Monday Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to unveil its video streaming service that places the tech giant in direct competition with market leader Netflix (NFLX). Pricing is not yet known; A USD 9.99/month Apple News Service will also likely be announced, another branch out into the media sector; but not all news sites are on board as Apple wants 50% of all subscription revenue. Magazine publishers, however, are embracing Apple's plan, MacRumors reported. Following the announcement of new iPads, iMacs and AirPods in the weeks running up to the event, it is unlikely any new hardware will be announced, although new Apple Pay features are expected to be unveiled, including partnerships for a credit scheme with Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; Analysts at JPMorgan expect the event to lack any “catalyst” in regard to influence on the share price, where they cite pre-announced products and pre-set expectations taking away the chances of any surprises.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: risk back on, or rather not as averse, MV3 highly unlikely to go ahead on Tuesday",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar has traded mostly on the back foot within a 96.686-404 range in DXY terms, and technically the near term outlook remains bearish for the index while under the 30 DMA (96.632). Moreover, Barclays preliminary month end rebalancing model suggests a modest to moderate Usd short requirement vs the Eur, Jpy, Gbp, Cad and Aud.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coincidentally, the Aussie is emerging from a volatile Monday session as one of the G10 outperformers and back on the 0.7100 handle vs the Usd. However, the Aud is marginally lagging behind its Antipodean peer as the Kiwi revisits 0.6900 against its US counterpart and Aud/Nzd loses grip of 1.0300 again ahead of the RBNZ on Wednesday. More immediately, RBA’s Ellis is due to speak later tonight and could provide some independent impetus for the Aud.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona is on track to be crowned champion currency in Scandinavia (and not far behind the Nzd in the major ranks) as a combination of bullish factors (chart signals, improving risk sentiment overall and an upbeat/hawkish Riksbank) aid a significant rebound from last Friday’s lows. Eur/Sek is hovering just shy of 10.4500 vs a more static Eur/Nok around 9.6685 amidst softer oil prices for the main part.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has gradually extended gains vs the Greenback to 1.1330 in wake of the latest German Ifo survey that painted a much better, or nowhere near as bad picture of the Eurozone’s premier economy compared to last Friday’s flash PMIs. The headline pair has now breached the 30 DMA at 1.1321 and could target 1.1350 next given no big chart hurdles in between.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has been very volatile either side of the 1.3200 marker vs the Usd and from 0.8600 to 0.8550 during EU trade vs the Euro, with Brexit still to the fore and the main driver. Attention remains on MV3, indicative votes and latest amendments after UK PM May held crisis meetings at her country estate over the weekend and only just overcame a Cabinet coup to oust her. She held more talks with her Ministers today, had a phone discussion with DUP leader Foster and spoke to opposition Labour leader Corbyn and it seemed that a 3rd vote on the WA could have been slated for Tuesday, but in a formal a statement she conceded there is still not enough support to bring it back to Parliament and will instead continue to talk with aim of holding another HoC vote this week. Note, big expiry options could have entered the fray in Cable, but 1.6 bn at the 1.3200 strike and 1.4 bn at 1.3250 were ultimately left unscathed.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Mixed fortunes for the renowned safe-haven currencies as Usd/Jpy rebounded from overnight lows alongside broad risk appetite and was there or thereabouts to trigger 2 bn expiries at 110.00 around the NY cut within a 109.72-110.23 range. However, the Franc benefited from general Usd weakness to trade at fresh peaks just above 0.9920 and stayed mid-range vs the Euro (1.1255-20).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A late EU squeeze in crude that saw WTI trade flat vs circa Usd1/brl adrift at worst helped the Loonie rebound relatively firmly to circa 1.3400 vs its US rival from 1.3445 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Try has recaptured some of its recent outsize losses, but not without more pressure and selling during a whippy start to the week, and a big lift from the Buck’s broad downturn. Indeed, Lira woes look far from over despite more supportive rhetoric from the Government and CBRT, as some forward money market rates spiked to 29%. Usd/Try now around 5.5600 vs 5.7700+ at the high.</p>",

Indeed, Cable has made a 50+ pip round trip on the 1.3200 axis in just a matter of minutes following reports that the 3rd vote could go ahead tomorrow, which prompted Gbp buying on the basis that PM May must be more confident of a positive outcome this time, but then selling when a call between her and DUP counterpart Foster is said to have left the coalition party in the same position on the WA as it was. However, the pair is back above the big figure again, partly due to broader Dollar weakness as the DXY slips below 96.500 and to marginal new session lows.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Nomura says that on Friday, fundamentals-based global macro HFs added short positions on US stocks. \"They have exhibited contrarian selling, which has dragged down the US stock market since it touched its highest level since last October, and thus we cannot rule that some bearish participants may have used the inversion of the 3m10y curve as an excuse to sell or take profits.\"</li><li>Nomura explains that some CTAs/systematic trend-followers were one forced to sell futures in response to an unexpected end to the upward trend in the US stock market, even though they were just about to resume buying futures. \"The accumulated size of CTAs' long positions is estimated by Nomura to be relatively small, and the current tipping point or breakeven level for their long positions is ~2,750. So most of them have not felt it necessary to cut their loss-making positions so far,\" and the bank believes that \"we are still far away from a situation where we need to be wary of mechanical liquidation caused by deleveraging by CTAs. \"Trend-following programs have turned and suggest taking a 'waitand- see' approach or trying to sell futures slightly.\"</li><li>Nomura says that because of the inversion of the 3m10y curve we should be aware of changes in participants' behaviour. \"In particular, we will monitor investors’ opinion, not economists, who have been relatively bullish on US stocks, relying on the steeping of the 5y30y curve since the beginning of the year.\" The bank says that if US equity market sentiment softens to near the neutral level, risk-taking appetite for medium and long-term investors will not be reduced. \"A correction in stock prices should give them a good opportunity to buy on dips, and in particular, hopes of a US-China trade agreement and the 'Powell-put' (where the Fed may change the course of interest rates in response to volatility) have been major drivers of the risk rally since February.\"</li><li>The bank adds that accumulated money flows via ETFs in the US market continue to suggest re-allocation from government bonds to stocks as of 22 March. \"Furthermore, unlike last December, the inversion of the UST curve has clearly not triggered massive underperformance in the cyclical sectors compared with the defensive sectors in US and global equity markets,\" and although the stock price index has moved sharply, \"there has not been a shift in sector allocation that has priced in a US economic recession so far; rather, in contrast with the bond and rates markets, the stock market, on the surface, barely has expectations of a bottoming out of the US and global economies.\"</li></ul>",

Back in Europe, stocks have somewhat nursed opening losses as sentiment improved following a better-than-forecast German Ifo Survey which aided the DAX (+0.1%) climb into positive territory. Elsewhere, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.4%) is marginally outperforming its peers as Fiat Chrysler (+3.3%) supports the index amid reports its chairman is pushing for a tie up with a rival, Peugeot (-0.7%) has been touted as a potential suitor. Sector-wise, IT names are underperforming, in-fitting with the sector’s performance overnight, whilst the consumer discretionary sector is buoyed by the overall positivity in auto stocks. Finally, this morning saw a LVMH (-0.5%) open lower by just under 9% and immediately pared losses with traders citing a potential “fat-finger” incident.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR</strong> - Not the biggest G10 mover or best performer, but the single currency has staged a firmer recovery rebound from sub-1.1300 lows vs the Dollar in wake of an encouraging Ifo survey, with beats on all 3 key metrics compounded by upward revisions to the previous month across the board. Hot on the heels of last Friday’s dire Eurozone preliminary PMIs, and an especially worrying German manufacturing print, the institute contends that the bloc’s number one economy is displaying relative resistance, and this has helped to dispel some concerns about a deeper slowdown, or even recession. However, Eur/Usd has not clearly breached upside technical resistance in the form of the 30 DMA that comes in around 1.1321.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong> - The Scandi Crowns are back on the front foot and leading the major league, with the Sek especially buoyant on a mixture of improving risk sentiment, bullish technicals and the Riksbank maintaining repo rate guidance for further tightening. Eur/Sek is back down below 10.4500 and Eur/Nok is eying bids/support at 9.6500 against the backdrop of oil prices trying to recover some poise after their end of week rout.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong> - All firmer vs their US counterpart after sharp underperformance last Friday when aversion was rife and safe-haven positioning escalated. Aud/Usd is back within striking distance of 0.7100 and Nzd/Usd is not too much further from 0.6900 even though Aud/Nzd has crossed 1.0300 from its latest decline through the big figure, while Usd/Cad is hovering near the bottom end of a 1.3445-05 range, as the Loonie also derives some underlying support from the aforementioned bounce in crude.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/CHF</strong> - Usd/Jpy has bounced from overnight safe-haven lows in line with the gradual improvement in risk appetite and through heavy 110.00 option expiry interest at the round number (2 bn), while Cable also looks unlikely to test expiry interest or hedges at the 1.3200 strike (1.6 bn) given ongoing/heightened Brexit jitters that have pulled the Pound down towards 1.3160 and close to 0.8600 vs the Euro (Ifo also impacting this pair). Similarly, the Franc has unwound some safe-haven premium towards 0.9950 against the Greenback from circa 0.9933 at one stage and 1.1250 vs around 1.1223 against the single currency.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Yet more thrills and spills for the Lira after official intervention against a big US bank that put out a bearish trade recommendation on the Try, and the CBRT’s decision to double swap limits on outstanding FX maturities after shelving 1 week repos. Usd/Try currently at 5.6400 within a 5.7700-5.5700 band.</p><p>Turkish President Erdogan said those in the finance sector that purchase foreign currencies on expectations a decline in TRY, will pay a very heavy price. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to Friday’s almost universally dire PMIs, the March Ifo survey revealed a clean sweep of beats vs consensus and upgrades to back month readings for all 3 metrics, but the market reaction has been relatively limited. Nevertheless, Bunds have retreated further from earlier peaks to a 165.34 base, and the corresponding 10 year yield has crossed parity, albeit just, with Gilts down to 128.82 in sympathy. Meanwhile, having resisted the bulk of the bearish impulses from EU counterparts Treasuries have caved in; with the curve bear-steepening after Friday’s extreme flattening and yield compression. Indeed, 3-month 10yr spread is back to norm following its inversion.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI (+0.1%) and Brent (-0.1%)</strong> futures have rebounded off lows amid an improvement in risk-appetite with the former flirting with the USD 59.00/bbl to the upside whilst the latter resides just below the USD 67.00/bbl level. The latest CFTC data also shows that speculators increased next longs in NYMEX WTI by over 54k lots with a bulk of this increase driven by fresh positions. Elsewhere, Chinese crude imports increased by 2% in February to average around 10.3mln BPD, with a Y/Y increase of just under 22%. Furthermore, the country increased its share of Iranian and Venezuelan imports over February.</p><p><strong>Metals are largely on the front foot with gold (+0.4</strong>%) gaining further ground above USD 1300/oz with the recent fears surrounding and inverted yield curve between the US front-end and 10yr (Note: this has reversed) prompting additional demand in the yellow metal. Elsewhere, the twin cyclones which hit Australia over the weekend impacted mining and energy operations in the region, with reports stating some activities have been halted at BHP and Rio Tinto’s Pilbara mine. The mine is located in Western Australia and accounts for almost 40% of global iron ore production. The storms have now weakened to a category two, however there is no clarity on how long production will be halted and of any potential costs to the Australian economy.</p><p>US Coast Guard announced Houston Ship Channel closure impacting a 2-mile span and didn’t provide a timeline for reopening.

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/21451/download\">here</a>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities kicked off Monday trade mostly lower [Stoxx 600 -0.2%] following a dismal lead from Asia</strong> wherein the Nikkei 225 shed 3.0% and closed below 21,000 for the first time in over a month. Back in Europe, stocks have somewhat nursed opening losses as sentiment improved following a better-than-forecast German Ifo Survey which aided the DAX (Unch) to briefly climb into positive territory. Elsewhere, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.5%) is marginally outperforming its peers as Fiat Chrysler (+3.0%) supports the index amid reports its chairman is pushing for a tie up with a rival, Peugeot (-0.7%) has been touted as a potential suitor. Sector-wise, IT names are underperforming, in-fitting with the sector’s performance overnight, whilst the consumer discretionary sector is buoyed by the overall positivity in auto stocks. Finally, this morning saw a LVMH (+0.4%) open lower by just under 9% and immediately pared losses with traders citing a potential “fat-finger” incident.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR</strong> - Not the biggest G10 mover or best performer, but the single currency has staged a firmer recovery rebound from sub-1.1300 lows vs the Dollar in wake of an encouraging Ifo survey, with beats on all 3 key metrics compounded by upward revisions to the previous month across the board. Hot on the heels of last Friday’s dire Eurozone preliminary PMIs, and an especially worrying German manufacturing print, the institute contends that the bloc’s number one economy is displaying relative resistance, and this has helped to dispel some concerns about a deeper slowdown, or even recession. However, Eur/Usd has not clearly breached upside technical resistance in the form of the 30 DMA that comes in around 1.1321.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong> - The Scandi Crowns are back on the front foot and leading the major league, with the Sek especially buoyant on a mixture of improving risk sentiment, bullish technicals and the Riksbank maintaining repo rate guidance for further tightening. Eur/Sek is back down below 10.4500 and Eur/Nok is eying bids/support at 9.6500 against the backdrop of oil prices trying to recover some poise after their end of week rout.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong> - All firmer vs their US counterpart after sharp underperformance last Friday when aversion was rife and safe-haven positioning escalated. Aud/Usd is back within striking distance of 0.7100 and Nzd/Usd is not too much further from 0.6900 even though Aud/Nzd has crossed 1.0300 from its latest decline through the big figure, while Usd/Cad is hovering near the bottom end of a 1.3445-05 range, as the Loonie also derives some underlying support from the aforementioned bounce in crude.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/CHF</strong> - Usd/Jpy has bounced from overnight safe-haven lows in line with the gradual improvement in risk appetite and through heavy 110.00 option expiry interest at the round number (2 bn), while Cable also looks unlikely to test expiry interest or hedges at the 1.3200 strike (1.6 bn) given ongoing/heightened Brexit jitters that have pulled the Pound down towards 1.3160 and close to 0.8600 vs the Euro (Ifo also impacting this pair). Similarly, the Franc has unwound some safe-haven premium towards 0.9950 against the Greenback from circa 0.9933 at one stage and 1.1250 vs around 1.1223 against the single currency.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Yet more thrills and spills for the Lira after official intervention against a big US bank that put out a bearish trade recommendation on the Try, and the CBRT’s decision to double swap limits on outstanding FX maturities after shelving 1 week repos. Usd/Try currently at 5.6400 within a 5.7700-5.5700 band.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to Friday’s almost universally dire PMIs, the March Ifo survey revealed a clean sweep of beats vs consensus and upgrades to back month readings for all 3 metrics, but the market reaction has been relatively limited. Nevertheless, <strong>Bunds</strong> have retreated further from earlier peaks to a 165.34 base, and the corresponding 10 year yield has crossed parity, albeit just, with <strong>Gilts</strong> down to 128.82 in sympathy.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> (+0.1%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (-0.1%) futures have rebounded off lows amid an improvement in risk-appetite with the former flirting with the USD 59.00/bbl to the upside whilst the latter resides just below the USD 67.00/bbl level. The latest CFTC data also shows that speculators increased next longs in NYMEX WTI by over 54k lots with a bulk of this increase driven by fresh positions. Elsewhere, Chinese crude imports increased by 2% in February to average around 10.3mln BPD, with a Y/Y increase of just under 22%. Furthermore, the country increased its share of Iranian and Venezuelan imports over February.</p><p>Metals are largely on the front foot with <strong>gold</strong> (+0.4%) gaining further ground above USD 1300/oz with the recent fears surrounding and inverted yield curve between the US front-end and 10yr (Note: this has reversed) prompting additional demand in the yellow metal. Elsewhere, the twin cyclones which hit Australia over the weekend impacted mining and energy operations in the region, with reports stating some activities have been halted at BHP and Rio Tinto’s Pilbara mine. The mine is located in Western Australia and accounts for almost 40% of global <strong>iron ore</strong> production. The storms have now weakened to a category two, however there is no clarity on how long production will be halted and of any potential costs to the Australian economy.</p>",

Conversely, Eur/Usd has rebounded above 1.1300 with a bit more conviction to circa 1.1323, but not convincingly through resistance at the 30 DMA (1.1321) amidst pretty downbeat comments from ECB’s Hansson, and perhaps wary that the latest Ifo update could be a blip rather than a turning point for the Eurozone biggest economy.</p>",

Gilts gapped down 14 ticks to 129.08 and have traded lower since within a 128.90-129.12 range alongside retreating Bunds, and US Treasuries to a lesser degree, as reports emerge that the PM did offer to resign, albeit not mentioning any timeframe, in an effort (last ditch) to secure enough support for the WA. However, the Short Sterling strip has been much more indecisive and volatile either side of parity between +1.5 to -1 tick at the extremes, trying to weigh up all options including the PM’s deal, no deal, a softer and even A 50 being revoked completely. All eyes/ears now on the 9.00GMT and 10.00GMT meetings ahead of what promises to be yet another dramatic if not climactic week in Parliament.</p>",

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>US Coast Guard announced Houston Ship Channel closure impacting a 2-mile span and didn’t provide a timeline for reopening. (Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>The Tplex traded in a narrow range in the Asian session before a wave of buyers came into the market on the back of a risk off sentiment becoming catalysed by a big drop in German manufacturing, the lowest since 2012, the move was exacerbated by the US missing PMI expectations too. Friday also saw the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverting, triggering algos to rotate out of equities and into bonds, as well as catching traders’ attention, and stoking fears about the health of the US economy, since an inverted 3m/10yr curve usually portends recession, analysts said. However, FOMC arch dove Bullard – who has vigorously warned against inversions in the past – said that it would only be a real concern if the inversion was sustained. Into settlement, Treasuries came off their highs slightly, but the rally remained intact, with the yields of the belly falling by c. 10bps; the 2s/5s contracted by 1.1bps, whilst the 5s/30s steepened by 1.2bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled 21+ ticks higher at 124-01.</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (voter, dove)</strong> said Q1 weakness will be transitory and sees no need for any rate moves, while he also commented that inversion is noticeable but needs to be sustained to have any economic importance. (WSJ)</p><p><strong>Fed's Evans (voter, dove)</strong> said the US economy is in a strong position and that it is a good time to pause and be cautious, while he added that US monetary policy is currently neither accommodative or restrictive. Evans also commented they will take action if inflation undershoots, while he wants to see more inflation and does not expect a rate hike till H2 next year. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed board nominee Moore</strong> said he is unsure if the Fed should be cutting rates now, while he added that sound monetary policy with stable prices can lead to strong growth and that he considers himself a growth hawk. Moore also commented that the Fed's move in December was a very substantial mistake which thankfully they have reversed course on, while he added deflation can be as harmful for an economy as inflation and that raising rates would create deflation. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Attorney General William Barr submitted to Congress his summary of the main conclusions from special counsel Mueller’s investigation in which it found that President Trump's campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>the report summary did not draw a conclusion as to whether President Trump illegally obstructed justice but also did not exonerate him</strong>, while House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer suggested that William Barr is not a neutral observer of the Mueller report and said Congress require full Mueller report and underlying documents.

ASX 200 (-1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-3.1%) declined from the open in which Tech and Energy led the broad losses across the sectors in Australia, while selling in Tokyo was exacerbated by flows into JPY which dragged the local benchmark below the 21,000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) conformed to the negative tone as participants digested a slew of earnings and after PBoC inaction resulted to a CNY 60bln liquidity drain, with oil names among the worst hit following a recent slip in crude prices. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned by safe-haven demand and as yields tracked the declines in global counterparts to push the 10yr JGB yield to its lowest since September 2016 and 30yr JGB yields to its lowest since November 2016.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week with hefty losses as the region follows suit to the stock sell-off last Friday on Wall St where disappointing PMI data from both sides of the Atlantic added to slowdown concerns, while curve inversion in which yields on US T-bills rose above 10yr yields for the first time since the GFC also stoked recession fears. ASX 200 (-1.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-3.4%) declined from the open with Tech and Energy frontrunning the broad losses across the sectors in Australia, while selling in Tokyo has been exacerbated by flows into JPY which dragged the local benchmark below the 21,000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) conform to the negative tone as participants digest a slew of earnings and after PBoC inactions resulted to a CNY 60bln liquidity drain, with oil names among the worst hit following a recent slip in crude prices.</p><p>In FX markets, a lack of overnight data releases has kept the DXY stable around last week’s best levels, while its major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD struggling to reclaim the 1.1300 handle after the poor Euro zone PMIs and with GBP/USD cautious amid doubts to PM May’s survival in office. Reports over the weekend noted a plot within PM May’s cabinet to replace her with Michael Gove as caretaker PM, while other reports suggested that her Deputy Lidington was the choice favoured by several Cabinet Ministers. This saw GBP/USD give back some of Friday’s strength as well as the 1.3200 level, but with downside limited ahead of a large option expiry of USD 1.6bln at the aforementioned level for today’s New York cut. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped below 110.00 due to flows from the negative risk sentiment which has also dampened high beta currencies AUD and CAD, although NZD is steady as it bides its time ahead of this week’s RBNZ meeting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as prices are underpinned by safe-haven demand and with yields tracking the declines in global counterparts to push the 10yr JGB yield to its lowest since September 2016 and 30yr JGB yields to its lowest since November 2016.</p>",
