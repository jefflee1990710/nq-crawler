PM Johnson also reiterated his argument that getting a deal would be made impossible if MPs vote for a Brexit delay and that the UK is to leave on 31st October as he will not ask for a delay under any circumstances but believes UK will get a deal at the October EU summit. In other news, UK PM Johnson said Chancellor Javid will announce a spending round on Wednesday. (Newswires/Sky)</p><p>UK PM Johnson is expected to say if lawmakers vote for another Brexit delay on Tuesday, there will be a vote for a General Election on Wednesday with the view to conduct the vote on 14th October according to ITV’s Peston, while other reports also suggested that PM Johnson wants an election before the EU Council meeting scheduled for 17th-18th October. (Twitter/ITV/Sun)</p><p>A senior government source said that a vote by MPs on preventing a no-deal will essentially be a confidence vote in the government and that the logical extension of that argument is that if the government loses an election will follow, according to ITV’s Brand. Furthermore, a government source also stated it is wrong for MPs to strip control of Parliament from the government without the consent of the people, according to The Sun's political editor who sees this as a strong case of 'General Election talk'. (Twitter/ITV/Sun)</p><p>Legislation to stave off a no-deal Brexit would reportedly request a three-month A50 extension if no deal is reached by 19th October, while it was separately reported that Tory rebels believe they are confident of around 19 rebels with perhaps half a dozen on top of it which would mean defeat for government, which is fuelling some election rumours in Whitehall.

(Twitter/Sky)</p><p>EU will only make compromises on backstop if there is a majority in UK Parliament and EU leaders currently see PM Johnson doesn't have the numbers, according to BBC's Katya Adler. Furthermore, no new proposals have been put forward by PM Johnson and there is said to be a deep sense of mistrust in Johnson's Government. (Newswires)</p><p>Irish PM Varadkar said alternative arrangements are better than nothing but he is prepared to veto alternative arrangements, while Varadkar is to meet UK PM Johnson next week and will listen to alternatives to the backstop although so far suggestions do not suffice.

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>REAR VIEW: US reject China request to delay tariffs; Europe PMIs still signal weakness, ramps pressure on ECB to act; more hawkish ECB talks; election talk grows in the UK; OPEC production seen rising.</strong></li><li><strong>AHEAD: RBA, Australian Retail Sales, Swiss CPI, Turkish CPI, UK Construction PMI, EZ PPI, US Manufacturing PMI, US ISM Manufacturing, US Construction Spending.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP:</strong> With US and Canadian players away for Labor Day, a mild risk-off tone to trade has engulfed markets. There was a collection of factors behind the cautious tone: although China’s Caixin PMI moved back into expansionary territory overnight, the internals (particularly new export orders) came in soft; it was a similar situation for the Eurozone manufacturing PMI, and most European countries manufacturing indices are still in contraction. UK PMI was grim, with no signs of Brexit stockpiling to support the economy in Q3. Gold and oil have largely taken their cues overarching sentiment, though the latter is also being pressured by signs of increasing crude supply, and a strengthening USD. Cash Treasuries were closed, and futures are slightly higher. In Fx, the USD is up; overnight, a stronger than expected yuan fix helped stabilised FX sentiment; expectations of ECB easing have weighed on EUR. GBP is under pressure amid Brexit news flow. After Europe left, US/China trade news weighed on risk assets, calling into question whether the two sides will meet in September for face-to-face talks. In a reaction, ES futures, which had been trading around the 2920 area, fell to sub-2900, though have recovered around the figure. Ahead of the APAC session, there will be attention on comments from UK PM Johnson at 1800 BST.</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>US officials reportedly rejected China’s request to delay the implementation of the 1st September tariffs, and the two sides are struggling to set a September meeting date for trade talks. In a reaction, risk assets saw downside.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD </strong>is firmer on Labor Day, taking its cue from a weakening yuan and EUR; although the PBOC fixed USDCNY stronger than models had suggested, adding ballast to EMFX, both onshore and offshore yuans are weaker – and found further weakness on negative trade headlines after the European close.<strong> EUR: </strong>Manufacturing<strong> </strong>PMIs improved slightly on the month, but are still mostly remain in contraction, ramping up pressure on the ECB to loosen policy on 12th September; the pricing for a 20bps rate cut is not over 50%, keeping EUR on the defensive; narrowing bund/BTP differentials have had little impact of late, but desks will be watching the outcome of the 5SM members poll on whether it approves a coalition with the PD. That Bund/BTP that spread has narrowed to around 165bps this week, from over 200bps a week earlier. <strong>GBP</strong> trades heavy on speculation UK PM Johnson is gearing up to call General Elections, while anti-Brexit MPs scheme. Havens <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> are up; with the latter, amid increasing speculation about the aggressive easing package the ECB will unleash next week, some are warning that EURCHF downside could force the SNB’s hand ahead of the ECB’s meeting, and indeed its own; data on Monday showed record sight deposits pared back in the weak, suggesting a less active SNB in currency markets. Elsewhere, <strong>XAU</strong> trades firm. <strong>EMFX </strong>is mixed<strong>. ARS </strong>reportedly fell to record lows in black market trade, newswires reported, after the country imposed capital controls – those controls were also cited by some as a reason why the <strong>BRL</strong> was under pressure; the Real could not build on manufacturing PMI rising to the highest since March, while a survey showed inflation expectations fell to fresh lows, the BCB’s survey economists said, giving more scope for the central bank to loosen policy. <strong>TRY</strong> is performing well in EMFX after firmer than expected GDP and PMI data. <strong>ZAR</strong> is flat.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> Hawkish remarks from ECB’s <strong>Lautenschlager</strong>, and Holzmann (who replaces Nowotny), ahead of the central bank’s 12th September confab. The former, when asked about the need for a package of stimulus measures, echoed recent remarks from ECB's Knot, saying it is much too early for a huge package; she is still convinced that the APP is a measure of last resort, only to be used if the risk of deflation is present, and added that rate cuts would be something to think about before you consider non-standard measure like APP. <strong>Holzmann</strong>, who is showing his hawkish feathers early on in his tenure, on the weekend said he’d “probably express more criticism toward proposals for further monetary deepening.”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson is mulling early elections if pro-EU lawmakers who want to block a no-deal Brexit defeat the government in a confidence this week, BBC reported; UK state news also said \"live discussions\" were happening in Downing Street to ask Parliament to approve a snap poll - something which could happen as soon as Wednesday, though no decision has been made. The move seems designed to bring Tory rebels on side (around 19 of them, reports suggest), with the argument that if they do not back the government in parliament (either by voting against the government in a confidence motion, or backing legislation that ties the government's hands), then they face the prospect of campaigning for their jobs. The immediate question is when any election would take place - before the EU meeting on 17-18th August? After that meeting, allowing the EU to either jawbone or make an offer to force a UK extension? Before Brexit on 31st October (giving a new government scope to extend Article 50)? Or after the Brexit date, after which the UK will already have left the EU. Johnson is holding an emergency meeting with Cabinet members in the afternoon, before the PM hosts Conservative lawmakers at a reception at Downing Street. Meanwhile, Brexit rebels are set to take control of parliamentary affairs on Wednesday, when they will try to force through legislation that calls for a three month A50 extension (to 31/Jan/2020) if PM Johnson has not secured an exit deal with the EU on 19th October (a day after the EU summit); Downing Street has intimated that the legislation will be a de facto confidence vote on the government, and there is speculation that an election would be called if the government does not come out on top this week.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE:</strong> Oil was pressured by overall risk sentiment, as well as signs of more crude coming to the market. Russian crude oil production rose to 11.29mln BPD in August (vs July’s 11.15mln BPD), while loadings of Russia's ESPO crude from Kozimo is set at a monthly record for October at 3.12mln tones; separately, Russia Energy Minister Novak says he discussed global oil market cooperation with his Iranian counterpart; Iraq’s August crude oil exports rose to 3.603mln BPD (vs 3.566mln BPD in July); Equinor has won permission to start its Sverdrup oilfield in the fall. Additionally, Bloomberg News’ monthly crude poll sees OPEC output rising in the latest month, with analysts estimating August oil production at 29.61mln BPD (+80k BPD vs July), the first increase since the new round of the oil supply curb deal came into effect at the beginning of the year; Nigeria and Saudi are set to lead the output gains, collectively adding 200k BPD to the market, the survey suggested; the report also noted how Russia has shown signs of backsliding on its commitments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Hong Kong leader Lam says she would 'quit' if she could, fears her ability to resolve crisis now 'very limited', Reuters reported. Separately, Hong Kong police were reportedly firing tear gas at protestors in the Mong Kok region. Elsewhere, Iran vowed to scale back its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal if Europe failed to shield Tehran's economy from US sanctions, foreign minister Zarif said.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Sterling woes as UK general election chatter grows",
        "content": "<p>GBP</p><p>Sterling sunk on Monday, with newswires citing the familiar theme of Brexit concerns as no deal by legal default creeps one day closer, although weaker than expected Manufacturing PMI data, which highlighted the impact Brexit is having on the economy, doing little to help. The currency staged a fleeting rebound as rumours began to circulate that a UK election could be called as early as this week, should the UK PM Johnson lose a vote forcing him ask for another Brextension (if he fails to broker a revamped deal). However, gains were quickly reversed, as participants digested the potential implications of an election; with the Conservative Party currently polling well ahead of the opposition and disunity in the opposition rendering the prospect of a Labour-Lib Dem coalition unlikely, an election could actually hand Johnson a larger majority. Right now, Cable is consolidating just above 1.2050; in terms of key levels, technicians will be eyeing the YTD low at 1.2015 and questioning whether the currency pair could see a similar price action to that seen in EURUSD last Friday, where the Single currency crashed below YTD lows and then the psychological 1.10 level vs the buck.</p><p>USD/EUR/CNY/JPY/CHF</p><p>DXY continued its crawl higher, making fresh YTD highs above the 99 handle despite a lack of North American players in the market (due to holidays in the region); weakness amongst rival’s EUR and CNY continuing to lend support. EURUSD could not poke its head back above 1.10, and extended on last Friday’s decline after PMI data failed to provide much in the way of hope that Eurozone manufacturing might be about to rebound, seemingly upping the pressure on the ECB to act next week (market implied probability of a 20bps cut at next week’s ECB meeting has now extended above 60%). Meanwhile, CNY started the week on the back foot, with fresh US &amp; Chinese tariffs on each other’s imports going into effect over the weekend and mixed signals from manufacturing PMI data doing little to help. Havens, JPY and CHF, were uneventful, with the former fairly flat around 106.30 and the latter slightly weaker above 0.99 vs the buck.</p><p>AUD/NZD/SEK/NOK/CAD</p><p>Some divergence in the Aussie and Kiwi saw AUDNZD down towards 1.0650 from 1.0685; the Aussie was initially weaker on the back of mixed Chinese PMIs overnight and a shock drop in Q2 Australian business inventories while the Kiwi, albiet also lower vs the buck in early trade, fared better on improved NZ Q2 terms of trade. However, the two staged somewhat of a comeback towards the end of European trading hours, AUDUSD and NZDUSD rebounding to 0.6730 and 0.6315 respectively from 0.6710 and 0.6290 lows. Similarly, USDCAD also rebounded off highs at 1.3360, falling back to overnight lows around 1.3310, despite an uneventful crude complex. The Scandis are both firmer on decent PMI data, most notably from Norway where the headline figure rebounded back above 50.0. AUD and SEK traders will now look ahead to RBA and Riksbank rate decisions on Tuesday and Thursday respectively.</p><p>EMFX</p><p>Broadly weaker amid dollar strength. However, TRY and ARS bucked the trend, with good PMI and better than expected GDP data supportive of the former, and the latter firming below the 60.00 handle with the announcement of capital controls seemingly halting the slide (for now).&nbsp;</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European indices are firmer [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.4%]</strong>, as markets initially struggled for clear direction, after the downbeat Asia-Pac session as the additional US levy on Chinese goods and China’s retaliatory tariffs came into effect alongside today’s US market holiday; before taking a positive line. Notably, the FTSE 100 (+1.5%) is outperforming its peers, as exporters benefit from the subdued Sterling due to the ongoing Brexit narrative over PM Johnson’s prorogation and the increasing likelihood of a no-deal outcome, whilst downbeat UK manufacturing PMI further weighed on the currency. Sectors opened the session all in the green but have since deteriorated somewhat to a mixed performance. In terms of individual movers, AstraZeneca (+3.3%) are topping the FTSE 100 after positive Phase III trial results; just below the Co. on the Stoxx 600 this morning is Adecco (+2.2%) after being upgraded to outperform from neutral at Credit Suisse. At the other end of the spectrum, Thyssenkrupp (-0.8%) shares are lower ahead of Wednesday’s DAX 30 reshuffle, during which the Co. are expected to be demoted from the index and German listed MTU Aero Engines (+2.1%) is seen as a strong contender for the empty spot.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Sterling was already looking shaky in the run up to the UK manufacturing PMI amidst reports of RHS demand in Eur/Gbp for the 9.00 am fix (perhaps residual or belated month end orders), with Cable slipping towards and just through 1.2100 amidst heightened jitters ahead of tomorrow’s new and potentially truncated Parliament term. However, the Pound briefly regrouped even though the headline print was worse than forecast and sub-components were bleak before succumbing to more selling pressure as Tory rebels continued their condemnation of PM Johnson’s move to suspend the upcoming session in an attempt to head off a no deal Brexit motion. On that note, latest reports suggest that a cross-party group will launch a bill aimed at blocking no deal within hours, and Cable is hovering just above 1.2075 awaiting further developments/news, while Eur/Gbp is holding near the top of a circa 0.9025-85 range. From a chart perspective, 1.2065 is next on the downside for Cable (August 20 low) ahead of 1.2015 (2019 base) and hefty option/barrier interest at the 1.2000 strike</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar is firmer almost across the board, as the DXY inches a bit further above the 99.000 handle to a marginal new ytd peak (99.109) and closer to the next line of chart resistance (99.262) in wake of additional/higher US tariffs on around 1/3 of the remaining Usd300 bn Chinese goods and Usd75 bn US exports to China in return. However, the Greenback is also gaining at the expense of rival currencies that continue to weaken of their own accord, as noted above.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY -</strong> The single currency derived some indirect support via the aforementioned Sterling cross activity through the run of Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, but Eur/Usd has subsequently retreated from a circa 1.1000 recovery high to print a fresh, albeit slender, yearly low at 1.0958, not far from supposed expiries at 1.0950, but away from a hefty 1.8 bn rolling off at the big figure. Meanwhile, the Franc is closer to the base of a 0.9918-0.9890 band, but outperforming vs the Euro within 1.0866-99 parameters and the Loonie has lost impetus between 1.3310-1.3340 vs its US counterpart. Elsewhere, the Aussie is meandering from 0.6715 to 0.6735 on the back of mixed Chinese PMIs overnight and a shock drop in Q2 Australian business inventories vs the Kiwi that is just keeping its head above 0.6300 following improved NZ Q2 terms of trade that has nudged Anz/Nzd down towards 1.0650 from 1.0685. The Yen has drifted towards 106.40 from just over 106.00 at one stage with Japanese PM Abe due to announce a cabinet reshuffle next week and Q2 Capex a bit better than expected.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK - </strong>The Scandi Crowns have both been boosted by encouraging manufacturing PMIs, and especially from Norway where the headline rebounded above 50.0 again, with Eur/Sek eyeing 10.7500 and Eur/Nok sub-10.0000.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Turkish Lira has also rebounded from worst levels with the aid of a better manufacturing PMI, but also as Q2 GDP data revealed less contraction. Usd/Try has tested 5.8000 bids/support vs a high just a few pips shy of 5.8400, but Usd/Ars may see more upside if capital controls fail to stop the rot.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>UK bonds remain well ahead of core contemporaries and roughly on a par with Italian BTPs, but lost momentum within single digits of their 134.91 Dec19 futures peak posted last Thursday after follow-through buying in wake of a deeper sub-50 manufacturing PMI. However, Gilts and Short Sterling appear more focused on events behind the scenes in Whitehall and moves to enact legal challenges to a no deal Brexit as early as Tuesday if not sooner. Meanwhile, Bunds and US Treasuries are lagging in thinner Labour Day trading conditions amidst a rebound in broad risk sentiment, albeit fragile and flaky, with the curves steeper. Note, the 10 year German benchmark recently retreated to 178.60, through last Friday’s 178.63 intraday base, but respecting the August 29 session trough (178.57) for now at least.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures are slightly softer, with prices just above the 55/bbl and 59/bbl levels</strong> with little by way of specific catalysts thus far, although gains in the complex are somewhat capped by the latest imposition of US and China tariffs in which China slapped a 5% levy on US crude oil exports. Despite demand woes outweighing supply concerns, it is worth keeping an eye on Hurricane Dorian which, according to the NHC’s latest update, is drifting westward with life-threatening storm surges and dangerous hurricane-force winds expected along the Florida east coast through mid-week. As it stands, production in the Gulf of Mexico has not been affected. On the geopolitical front, UK is said to be considering sending drones to near the Gulf of Oman amid its crisis with Iran, which follows comments from the UK’s Royal Navy Captain who stated that its warship has faced 115 confrontations with the IRGC since the start of July. Elsewhere, <strong>gold prices</strong> are marginally firmer, in-spite of the weaker Buck, albeit the yellow metal remains above the USD 1500/oz handle. <strong>Copper prices</strong> are lacklustre today as trade woes weighed on the red metal with little impetus derived from mixed China PMIs. Meanwhile, China’s <strong>iron ore</strong> futures rose around 6% at a point to a two-week high with desks citing robust short-term demand with Beijing rolling out more support measures to the Chinese economy. Finally, <strong>nickel prices</strong> gained in excess of 8% after the Indonesian Finance Ministry said nickel ore export ban will take effect as of January 1st 2020 (as touted), and new mineral ore export ban is only to be implemented for all Nickel Ore grades.</p>",

However, the Pound briefly regrouped even though the headline print was worse than forecast and sub-components were bleak before succumbing to more selling pressure as Tory rebels continued their condemnation of PM Johnson’s move to suspend the upcoming session in an attempt to head off a no deal Brexit motion. On that note, latest reports suggest that a cross-party group will launch a bill aimed at blocking no deal within hours, and Cable is hovering just above 1.2075 awaiting further developments/news, while Eur/Gbp is holding near the top of a circa 0.9025-85 range. From a chart perspective, 1.2065 is next on the downside for Cable (August 20 low) ahead of 1.2015 (2019 base) and hefty option/barrier interest at the 1.2000 strike&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar is firmer almost across the board, as the <strong>DXY </strong>inches a bit further above the 99.000 handle to a marginal new ytd peak (99.109) and closer to the next line of chart resistance (99.262) in wake of additional/higher US tariffs on around 1/3 of the remaining Usd300 bn Chinese goods and Usd75 bn US exports to China in return. However, the Greenback is also gaining at the expense of rival currencies that continue to weaken of their own accord, as noted above.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>The single currency derived some indirect support via the aforementioned Sterling cross activity through the run of Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, but Eur/Usd has subsequently retreated from a circa 1.1000 recovery high to print a fresh, albeit slender, yearly low at 1.0958, not far from supposed expiries at 1.0950, but away from a hefty 1.8 bn rolling off at the big figure. Meanwhile, the Franc is closer to the base of a 0.9918-0.9890 band, but outperforming vs the Euro within 1.0866-99 parameters and the Loonie has lost impetus between 1.3310-1.3340 vs its US counterpart. Elsewhere, the Aussie is meandering from 0.6715 to 0.6735 on the back of mixed Chinese PMIs overnight and a shock drop in Q2 Australian business inventories vs the Kiwi that is just keeping its head above 0.6300 following improved NZ Q2 terms of trade that has nudged Anz/Nzd down towards 1.0650 from 1.0685. The Yen has drifted towards 106.40 from just over 106.00 at one stage with Japanese PM Abe due to announce a cabinet reshuffle next week and Q2 Capex a bit better than expected.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns have both been boosted by encouraging manufacturing PMIs, and especially from Norway where the headline rebounded above 50.0 again, with Eur/Sek eyeing 10.7500 and Eur/Nok sub-10.0000.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira has also rebounded from worst levels with the aid of a better manufacturing PMI, but also as Q2 GDP data revealed less contraction. Usd/Try has tested 5.8000 bids/support vs a high just a few pips shy of 5.8400, but Usd/Ars may see more upside if capital controls fail to stop the rot.</p>",

This rather than positioning ahead of the looming manufacturing PMI is keeping UK bonds and the 3 month strip afloat with the 10 year future hugging the top of a 134.61-24 Liffe range, and not that far from the recent 134.91 contract peak, while STIRs are flat to 3.5 ticks up on the day so far. Elsewhere, it seems that the Pound has not only suffered more political/Brexit jitters, but also weakness vs the Euro for the 9.00 am fix, per market contacts.</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were lower with early underperformance seen in Australia’s energy sector following the recent pullback for oil prices and with Telecoms weighed after Telstra reduced its FY EBITDA guidance, while the Japanese benchmark was also downbeat but off its lows as price action was determined by a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) diverged with outperformance in the mainland despite the latest round of tariffs taking effect, as China’s state council pledged more support for the economy and Caixin Manufacturing PMI topped estimates with its first expansion in 3 months, to provide some much-needed reprieve after the miss on China’s Official Manufacturing PMI data over the weekend. Conversely, the Hang Seng lagged following further clashes between protesters and police over the weekend and as participants reacted to a slump in Retail Sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs declined despite the risk averse tone in Japan, with prices weakened after the BoJ lowered its purchase amounts of 10yr-25yr JGBs for today’s Rinban operation, while it also recently announced a reduction in its buying intentions in 5yr-10yr JGBs for the month.</p>",
