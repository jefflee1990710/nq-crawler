Furthermore, there had been earlier comments from a spokesperson that PM Johnson set out a range of options as an alternative to the Irish backstop and said that he wants a deal, while the government was said to be working at pace to find a wide variety of flexible and creative solutions to unique circumstances on Ireland. (Newswires)</p><p>EU President Juncker told UK PM Johnson he would look at any concrete proposals as long as they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement and that the EU will do everything it can to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

In related news, Labour Party leader Corbyn urged Tory MPs to help block no-deal Brexit, while it was separately reported that former chancellor Hammond plans to spearhead efforts to block a no-deal and intends to advocate a cross-party plan to force a Brexit delay by several months. (Newswires/ITV/Telegraph)</p><p>ECB Vice President de Guindos said the ECB must act with determination when asked about negative rates and stated that we are going to have low rates for a long time. ECB's de Guindos also commented that it is important for the ECB to get the market view on where the economy stands and where it is heading, while he added that expectations priced into financial markets need to be taken with a pinch of salt and that monetary policy is data dependent not market dependent.

Fixed Income, XAU, and Yen took their cues and climbed higher through the US session amid haven flows, whilst crude was coupled to equities up until it spiked into the green just prior to energy settlement (with Brent option expiry likely a factor). As the dust settles from the G7 Summit, the question being asked is whether G7 Mirage would be a more suiting title, where despite optimistic comments from Western leaders, the fundamental backdrop on issues such as US-China trade, Brexit, and Iran remains little changed; mind you the progressive stance could yield some progress, at least. Some dovish comments from ECB’s De Guindos weighed on the Euro, whilst plans in UK parliament to block a no-deal Brexit was supportive for cable. At this moment, no indication has been given from the EU that the UK's latest backstop alternatives are viable; and talks between Italy's 5SM and PD will continue Wednesday, although PD described Tuesday's talks as \"fruitful\".</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>There has been no substantial move in trade talks, some reports said, citing US insiders. Chinese press has said that while talks are continuing between the US and China teams, they are technical in nature, and negotiators were not on the verge of a deal. China has begun buying soybeans from South American producers for February and March delivery, Bloomberg reported, in a sign that buyers are securing themselves again a protracted dispute with the US. Elsewhere, China Global Times Editor Hu Xijin said China issued 20 directives to boost domestic consumption, making it more and more difficult for the US to press China to make concessions.</p><p><strong>* CHINA EQUITIES:</strong> After the APAC close on Tuesday, MSCI raised its inclusion factor for China A-Shares to 15% from 10%, which could drive USD 4.5bln of passive flows into A-Shares, analysts noted; the pace of active inflows will likely vary based on macro events, like the US/China trade talks. In total, the move could drive around USD 23bln of inflows, China International Capital Corporation has said. The inclusion is set to raise China A-shares weighting in the MSCI China index and MSCI emerging market index to 7.8% and 2.5%, respectively.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB Vice President de Guindos, when asked about negative rates, said that the ECB must act with determination and added that the Eurozone will have low rates for a long time. The comments were perceived as dovish; European bonds initially rallied, albeit pared the move fairly quickly. De Guindos also said it was important for the ECB to get the market view on where the economy stands and where it is heading, but caveated his remarks, saying that expectations priced into financial markets need to be taken with a pinch of salt. De Guindos continued to push back against the influence of the market on monetary policy, arguing that it is data dependent, not market dependent, and indications from market expectations cannot replace policy judgement.</p><p><strong>* FED DISCOUNT MINUTES: </strong>Half of the Fed regional banks wanted no change to the discount rate ahead of the July FOMC. Directors of the New York, Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Richmond Fed wanted no change; five Fed regional banks wanted a 25bps cut; Minneapolis Fed wanted a 50bps cut. Several directors noted that inflation was near 2%, and others noted expectations had drifted lower.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Headline consumer confidence beat expectations in August, printing 135.1 (Exp. 129.5), though declined from the prior 135.8. Also adding to the strong report, the differential between jobs \"plentiful\" and jobs \"hard to get\" rose to 39.4 (Prev. 33.4), while one-year consumer inflation expectations also increased, a good sign for the Fed amid concerns about expectations, rising to 5% from 4.6%. The consumer has been a talking point among some Fed officials recently, with Rosengren (voter, who dissented at the July meeting) explicitly saying he was focusing on the consumer sector. Many key retailers also had strong earnings reports, with Walmart (WMT) particularly performing well. Recent retail sales data has also been strong, showing consumers are still active in the market. Pantheon Macroeconomics do note, however, that the expectations component of the report did fall 5.4 points, likely on the threat of tariffs; however, it notes that it was rescued by the present situation component, which rose surprisingly by 5.3 points, which tends to respond to shifts in the unemployment rate. Jobs plentiful rose to its highest since September 2000, which can be a decent guide to underlying wage pressures. However, Pantheon adds that like many other indicators, it has overstated upside risk to wage gains in the past, and still forecasts downside risks from latest trade war developments.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY/RUSSIA: </strong>Turkish President Erdogan said Turkey will continue to cooperate with Russia in the defence industry, coming amid the second delivery of the Russian S-400 missile system to Turkey. US Congress was widely expected to impose CAATSA sanctions upon the delivery of the first batch from Russia, but US President Trump took a more conciliatory approach to the issue: US red- lines now seem to have shifted from \"the delivery\" to \"the activation\" of the missile system. Nonetheless, the US House of Foreign Affairs committee did urge President Trump in a tweet to apply sanctions on Turkey for the purchase.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson’s Brexit Adviser Frost will head to Brussels on Wednesday for further talks on the Irish backstop, where a Johnson spokesperson says the PM has set out a range of backstop alternatives, however Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said the alternatives do not do the same as the backstop. Following a phone call on Tuesday, EU Commission President Juncker told Johnson he would look at any concrete proposals as long as they are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement (WA), and the EU will do everything it can to avoid a no deal Brexit; Juncker reiterated the EU’s “steadfast” support for Ireland. Whereas Johnson later said that unless the WA was reopened and the backstop abolished, there would be no-deal, but said they had \"positive and substantive\" talks with Juncker. While the rhetoric at the G7 was friendlier from UK officials and their European counterparts, Brexit was not a topic of discussion. Additionally, there has been little movement in core positions – the Johnson government wants the Irish backstop removed from the WA; the Europeans have insisted that, in the absence of another solution, the backstop is indispensable.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> Iranian President Rouhani reiterated that there will be no change of status quo provided US sanctions remain in place, further pushing back on US-Iran optimism from the G7. However, the WSJ reported that the Trump administration is preparing to engage in talks with the Iranian-backed Houthi militia in Yemen, additionally attempting to bring the Saudi's into the talks to find agreement on a ceasefire.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Deputy governor Debelle pointed to the US/UK/Canadian models as a guide for the RBA, noting that central banks from those countries got to lows somewhere between zero and half a percent, and suggested that this gives the RBA some guide as to what its own equivalent might be, with regards to the zero lower bound; Debelle also said that when Aussie rates hit that zone, the central bank would look at unconventional measures. On the currency, Debelle said he’d welcome AUD appreciation.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Monday’s optimism has given way to deadlock (again), after the 5SM suspended talks with the PD unless the latter agrees on installing Conte as PM; although PD Senate Chief Marcucci said on Tuesday that progress had been made on a deal with 5SM. This was followed by positive commentary from both parties who stated talks are continuing in a fruitful way with a good climate and that talks will continue Wednesday. There were earlier suggestions that grassroot 5SM members were unhappy with talks, and activists reportedly threatened to desert the party if it entered a coalition with the PD, citing the PD’s pro-EU and liberal stance. If talks fail between the two parties, President Mattarella is likely to install a caretaker government ahead of new elections.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 131-04+. </strong>The TPLEX made headway with decisive bull flattening, where the 2-year yield was 2.5bps lower and the 30-year yield fell 7.5bps, taking it beneath the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield for the first time since March 2009. Most of the bid in Fixed came shortly after the US equity open amid haven flows, which helped the 2s10s fall further into inversion, and the TYU9 contract remained firmer through till settlement. At the US 2-year auction, USD 40bln was sold at 1.516%, the lowest yield since September 2017, tailing by 0.1bps (vs. 6-auction average 0.6bps) and an above average bid-to-cover of 2.6x; indirects took slightly more than average, but so did primary dealers, and directs took less than average.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (Tue, USD 40bln), new 5-year note (Wed, USD 41bln) and new 7-year note (Thu, USD 32bln). Analysts at UBS say this week will bring USD 85bln of cash (excluding SOMA holdings) but including around USD 76bln of redemption, as well as around USD 8.5bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The 5-year sector lacks clear set-up from a relative value perspective, SocGen says, with the bank noting that the current 5-year note is trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s, though trades rich on the curve against 2s and 10s. The previous 5s auction was poor, seeing the lowest cover since December 2018. SocGen's analysts also note that dealer holdings in the 3-6 year are high, meaning that the participation of foreign and investment funds will be key. \"For the auction to go well, it will likely need a concession as the current when-issued yield for the sector is trading well below all auction stops since October 2016.\" The bank says it is negative on Wednesday's auction, saying that it may see an unscheduled reopening of an old 7-year note (the 1.875% august 2024 note) if the high yield is in the range of 1.875% to 1.999%.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (V9) SETTLE USD 1.29 HIGHER AT USD 54.93/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 0.81 HIGHER AT USD 59.51:</strong>&nbsp;The crude complex spent most of the session tracking risk appetite but bucked the trend on a spike higher going into settlement. Brent options expired at settlement, which is likely to have played a role in price action due to book squaring. Participants are looking towards the API data on Tuesday evening, where the latest US energy inventory expectations see crude stocks -2.1mln bbls, distillates +0.9mln, gasoline -0.4mln. Elsewhere, Mexican President Obrador said Mexico will increase oil production by the years end; Russia Energy Minister Novak said Russia will fulfill its commitment to the OPEC+ deal in August; Iranian’s Oil Minister says Iran can increase its oil production to the same level as before US sanctions were imposed within three days.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CAD: </strong>GBPUSD outperformed other currency pairs, the pair saw some strength after UK Labour Leader Corbyn met with opposition officials, where they came to an agreement that a legislative route is the most promising route to block a no deal Brexit. The pair breached Friday highs and tested stops said to be sitting at 1.2310, where the cross found resistance. EUR was undermined by relatively dovish comments from ECB’s de Guindos leaning towards determined policy action when asked about NIRP and after initially playing down market expectations that he deems too pessimistic. EURUSD slipped back below 1.1100 but remained close to the big figure with underlying support provided by positive noises from Italy’s 5-Star Movement and the PD party about progress towards a coalition regime agreement. CAD tracked risk appetite today as sentiment soured, weighing on the loonie, USDCAD gradually drifted through a Fib support at 1.3260 and headed towards 1.33.</p><p><strong>HAVENS</strong>: USDJPY traded with risk appetite as participants took a bid for havens after the cross found resistance at the 10dma of 106.16. The bid in havens also pushed US yields lower, therefore rate differentials also supported JPY. XAU traded higher amid flight to quality, CHF also higher against the USD.</p><p><strong>ANTIPODES</strong>: The Kiwi and Aussie have swapped places again and the AUDNZD cross reclaims 1.0600+ status and NZDUSD drifts back to 0.6360 from another attempt to reach 0.6400, while in contrast AUDUSD has edged back over 0.6750 with some technical traction derived from its recovery off circa 0.6746 lows and no follow-through or stop-selling on the break of a key Fib retracement level at 0.6749. However, the Aussie is still feeling the weight of bearish/dovish remarks from RBA’s Debelle overnight.</p><p><strong>EM:</strong> BRL was higher against the USD after the central bank announced it was selling USD 1bln in a spot FX US dollar auction. Argentinian Peso was lower despite efforts from the central bank, where they sold USD 302mln in its own reserves, breaking IMF guidelines for USD 250mln daily reserve sales. USDMXN was higher on the day with the poor jobless data and trade balance data failing to provide any favours to the Peso.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.3% AT 2869, NASDAQ-100 -0.1% AT 7566, DOW JONES -0.5% AT 25778, S&amp;P 500 SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.4%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; -0.3%, Energy&nbsp; -0.6%, Financials&nbsp; -0.7%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.6%, Industrials&nbsp; -0.4%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.1%, Materials&nbsp; 0.1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong>&nbsp;Altria (MO) surged whilst Phillip Morris (PM) tumbled amid confirmation that the two tobacco giants were indeed holding merger discussions. Boeing (BA) lagged the wider market after a Russian company filed a US lawsuit against it over 737 MAX issues. J.M. Smucker (SJM) opened lower after poor earnings and guidance. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) caught a reprieve rally as it received a smaller fine than expected in the Oklahoma opioid lawsuit; however related companies who still wait a verdict traded lower (ABC, HUM, TEVA, CAH). Verizon (VZ) carried the telecommunications sector on the back of an upgrade at Oppenheimer; the same analyst downgraded T-Mobile (TMUS) which traded at the bottom of the sector. Papa John’s (PZZA) outperformed after the announcement of a new CEO. Cree (CREE) and MongoDB (MDB) both caught bids after being upgraded at JPMorgan and Citi respectively. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) made gains on the release of its World of Warcraft Classic game. Gold miners (GOLD, NEM) were bid on firmer bullion prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/SEK/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound is now head and shoulders above its G10 counterparts with Cable testing stops said to be sitting at the top end of a 1.2310 range having breached last Friday’s high and yesterday’s UK bank holiday peak in the process, while Eur/Gbp took a downside chart level out at 0.9040 (55 DMA) on more Brexit deal optimism, or manoeuvres to try and ensure that Britain does not depart from the EU without an accord. Note also, some media outlets carried what appears to be a dated story suggesting more hope on the UK side that Brussels may re-open the WA after the G7 Summit, but no corroboration from the EU side and Sterling has eased back from best levels since. Conversely, the single currency was undermined by relatively dovish comments from ECB’s de Guindos leaning towards determined policy action when asked about NIRP and after initially playing down market expectations that he deems too pessimistic. Eur/Usd slipped back below 1.1100, but remained close to the big figure with underlying support provided by positive noises from Italy’s 5-Star Movement and the PD party about progress towards a coalition regime agreement. Elsewhere, the Swedish Crown has been underpinned and cushioned from broader shifts in risk sentiment by forecast-beating household consumption and a wider trade surplus with Eur/Sek hugging the base of a 10.6890-7555 range vs Eur/Nok nearer the top of 10.0230-9.9810 parameters.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/AUD</strong></p><p>The major losers, but not in the same order as they stood at various stages. The Kiwi and Aussie have swapped places again and the Aud/Nzd cross reclaims 1.0600+ status and Nzd/Usd drifts back to 0.6360 from another attempt to reach 0.6400, while in contrast Aud/Usd has edged back over 0.6750 with some technical traction derived from its recovery off circa 0.6746 lows and no follow-through or stop-selling on the break of a key Fib retracement level at 0.6749. However, the Aussie is still feeling the weight of bearish/dovish remarks from RBA’s Debelle overnight. Meanwhile, the Franc has extended its retreat against the Greenback and Euro to just shy of 0.9840 and 1.0915 respectively in contrast to a steadier, more resilient <strong>JPY</strong> (holding between 106.16-105.60 vs the Usd), and the aforementioned political developments in Rome appear to have compounded ‘official’ intervention theories supported by weekly Swiss sight deposit balances.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie gradually drifted down from 1.3225 to 1.3270 vs its US counterpart and through Fib support at 1.3260 as decent 1.3200 option expiries were never seriously tested and the overall market tone wavered alongside oil prices ahead of the latest API update.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Cnh pared some gains from circa 7.1800 to 7.1515 or so on no further angst on the US-China trade front, but Usd/Try remained elevated above 5.8000 as Turkey took delivery of the next S-400 order from Russia and pledged to maintain ties and cooperation with Russia’s defence sector.</p>",

(+1.4%)</strong> was underpinned after US President Trump’s softer tone on China in which he suggested that negotiations will begin shortly and thinks a deal will be reached. Furthermore, the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos and Chinese Industrial Profits returned to growth, although <strong>Hang Seng (Unch.)</strong> lagged amid a deluge of earnings, ongoing unrest and continued contraction in both Imports and Exports. Finally, 10yr JGBs weakened amid the improvement in risk sentiment and as prices homed in on the 155.00 level to the downside, although it eventually found some mild support following improved demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for super-long JGBs.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day reverse repo for a daily net injection of CNY 30bln.

Italy’s FTSE MIB (+1.0%) outperforms its peers as the Italian political landscape seems to be shifting away from a snap election, with a PD/5SM coalition seemingly materialising, albeit some sticking points remain around Conte’s role. Sectors are also mixed with the energy sector outperforming amid price action in the oil complex, whilst consumer discretionary follows a close second amid reports that China considers relaxing and removing restrictions on auto purchases, albeit it appears to be on the domestic front referring to restrictions around the circulation of used cars. Nonetheless, the European car and auto supplier index rose 1.0% amid hopes of spurred activity in China. In terms if individual movers, G4S (+1.9%) and E.ON (+1.5%) shares are supported by positive broker moves at RBC and Barclays respectively. Also of note, US judge ruled against Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) in a landmark opioid case in Oklahoma.

Comments from RBA’s Debelle overnight about the potential for further Aussie depreciation are weighing alongside guidance suggesting that other policy options would have to be mulled if the OCR was lowered to 0.5% (from 1% at present) and more stimulus is needed. Meanwhile, China’s Foreign Ministry continues to deny reports that calls were made to US trade negotiators over the weekend and maintains that Beijing will respond to additional US tariffs, but Nzd/Usd is holding up better between 0.6397-61.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/EUR -</strong> All firmer vs the Dollar as the DXY loses grip of the 98.000 handle again and Yen retains an underlying safe-haven bid above 106.00 where decent option expiries reside (1.2 bn) as a counterweight to similar size interest at 105.00 (1.1 bn). Meanwhile, Cable is rebounding from the low 1.2200 area to 1.2250+ and Eur/Gbp has retreated from just shy of 0.9100 as Brexit deal hopes vie with expectations that Italy could be on the verge of forming a new Government coalition and avoid a snap election. However, talks between the 5SM and PD to that end are contingent on the former party’s insistence that PM Conte is reinstalled and Eur/Usd appears reluctant to rally too far from the 1.1100 mark in advance.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF -</strong> The Loonie and Franc are narrowly mixed against the Greenback, with the former recovering from recent lows and meandering between 1.3257-28 amidst firmer crude prices and technical resistance providing support vs expiries forming resistance (1.3260 Fib and 1.3 bn at the 1.3200 strike respectively). Conversely, Usd/Chf is back up around 0.9800 and Eur/Chf is closer to 1.0900 than 1.0850 in wake of latest weekly updates showing record high Swiss sight deposits.</p><p><strong>SEK -</strong> The Swedish Krona is outperforming on the back of supportive data in the form of household spending and trade over mixed PPI, with Eur/Sek down around 10.7000 vs 10.7550+ at one stage, while Eur/NOK straddles 10.0000 in tighter parameters.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The steady rise in official Usd/Cny fixes continues, but the on-shore and off-shore Yuans are still trading considerably weaker than the official rate despite Chinese bank intervention to calibrate the declines. Indeed, the former closed at 7.1670 compared to 7.0810 and Usd/Cnh is currently around 7.1725 even though reports are circulating that China may relax and/or remove restrictions on auto purchases.</p><p><strong>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle</strong> said floor rates in Australia are likely between 0.0%-0.5% and that they have looked closely at minimum rates in other developed countries but hope we never have to get down to those levels. Debelle also stated that AUD has come down some and may well go down further, while he added that a fall in AUD would be helpful and they would have to consider other option if rates decline to 0.5%. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Bunds have settled down after a few wobbles alongside Gilts and US Treasuries with latest Chinese commentary on trade still suggesting that relations are strained and tetchy compared to President Trump’s more cordial view of the current situation. However, BTPs have pulled back quite sharply from just a few ticks away from 144.00 towards 143.00 on more political party bickering in Rome and another delayed meeting before President Mattarella finally calls time and has to defer to another election. More immediately, some US data snippets scheduled and including consumer confidence before the 2 year auction and after Central Bank speak from the ECB and BoE.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures have come off worst levels but remain in largely side-ways trade with little by way of catalysts to influence price action thus far. </strong>The benchmarks have been fluctuating on either side of 54/bbl and 59/bbl respectively throughout most of the session after finding bases at 53.60/bbl and 58.60/bbl. Ahead of the 12th September JMMC meeting, the committee noted that healthy oil demand and slowing global oil inventory growth should lead to significant draws in the second half of this year. The JMMC also noted that average July compliance among members stood at 159%, +22ppts M/M. Looking further ahead, the committee notes that the forecast for oil market fundamentals by major forecasters remains robust in 2019 and 2020. Elsewhere, <strong>gold prices</strong> have retreated from overnight highs but remain comfortably above the 1500/oz mark with little news-flow to sway prices<strong>. Copper</strong> posts mild gains, albeit more on the back of a slightly softer Buck. Finally, Chinese steel fell in excess of 3%, declining the most since November amid fears of weakening demand.</p><p><strong>JMMC</strong> highlight the importance of the Declaration of Cooperation in supporting market stability, alongside healthy oil demand and slowing global oil inventory growth should lead to significant draws in H2</p><p>- Overall conformity of 159% in July 2019 was 22 pp higher than in June</p><p>- Average conformity of 134% since January 2019 was the highest to date in 2019</p><p>- Going forward, the forecast for oil market fundamentals by major forecasters remains robust in 2019 and 2020</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Not quite all change down under, but there has been shift in cross-currents to the detriment of the Aussie vs its Antipodean peer with Aud/Nzd back under 1.0600 and Aud/Usd slipping back below 0.6750. Comments from RBA’s Debelle overnight about the potential for further Aussie depreciation are weighing alongside guidance suggesting that other policy options would have to be mulled if the OCR was lowered to 0.5% (from 1% at present) and more stimulus is needed. Meanwhile, China’s Foreign Ministry continues to deny reports that calls were made to US trade negotiators over the weekend and maintains that Beijing will respond to additional US tariffs, but Nzd/Usd is holding up better between 0.6397-61.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Dollar as the <strong>DXY </strong>loses grip of the 98.000 handle again and Yen retains an underlying safe-haven bid above 106.00 where decent option expiries reside (1.2 bn) as a counterweight to similar size interest at 105.00 (1.1 bn). Meanwhile, Cable is rebounding from the low 1.2200 area to 1.2250+ and Eur/Gbp has retreated from just shy of 0.9100 as Brexit deal hopes vie with expectations that Italy could be on the verge of forming a new Government coalition and avoid a snap election. However, talks between the 5SM and PD to that end are contingent on the former party’s insistence that PM Conte is reinstalled and Eur/Usd appears reluctant to rally too far from the 1.1100 mark in advance.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Franc are narrowly mixed against the Greenback, with the former recovering from recent lows and meandering between 1.3257-28 amidst firmer crude prices and technical resistance providing support vs expiries forming resistance (1.3260 Fib and 1.3 bn at the 1.3200 strike respectively). Conversely, Usd/Chf is back up around 0.9800 and Eur/Chf is closer to 1.0900 than 1.0850 in wake of latest weekly updates showing record high Swiss sight deposits.</p><p><strong>SEK</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona is outperforming on the back of supportive data in the form of household spending and trade over mixed PPI, with Eur/Sek down around 10.7000 vs 10.7550+ at one stage, while Eur/<strong>NOK </strong>straddles 10.0000 in tighter parameters.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The steady rise in official Usd/Cny fixes continues, but the on-shore and off-shore Yuans are still trading considerably weaker than the official rate despite Chinese bank intervention to calibrate the declines. Indeed, the former closed at 7.1670 compared to 7.0810 and Usd/Cnh is currently around 7.1725 even though reports are circulating that China may relax and/or remove restrictions on auto purchases, albeit for the benefit of domestic consumers.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*THE LATEST:</strong></p><ul><li>Sources have stated that coalition talks between the 5-Star Movement and PD have materialised and the two parties are reportedly nearing an agreement which would see Conte return as PM and avert an early general election. The 5SM and PD leaders hashed out details into the early hours of Tuesday, albeit the 2020 budget remains a sticking point. ANSA reported that the two parties will reconvene today at 1000BST/0500ET to continue deliberations.</li></ul><p><strong>*WHAT’S NEXT:</strong></p><ul><li>Consultations with smaller parties will begin today and end on Wednesday. Italian President Mattarella will be hosting a series of talks tomorrow in which the PD leadership will meet at 1700BST/1200ET whilst 5SM will meet at 1800BST/1300ET.</li></ul><p><strong>*PEBBLE IN DI MAIO’S SHOE:</strong></p><ul><li>&nbsp;FT reported that activists from the 5SM have threatened to desert the party if it enters into a coalition with the PD. Rome-based 5SM activist Lazzari told the FT that “almost everyone” is against the hypothetical agreement with the PD, “The PD are too pro-Euro, too liberal,” he said. 5SM leader Di Maio has put forth a list of ten policy points for any future coalition and has demanded that Conte remains as PM. A PD source noted that leader Zingaretti was “inclined to accept Conte”. If talks fail between the two parties, President Mattarella is likely to install a caretaker government ahead of new elections.</li></ul><p><strong>*SALVINI’S MISCALCULATION:</strong></p><ul><li>The League leader had not banked on a potential 5SM-PD coalition or for Conte to emerge as his main rival. Salvini’s move to bring down the government has cost him party support, the League has slipped to 33.7% from 38.9% in late July, according to a poll published on Sunday. In terms of popularity stakes, Conte eclipses both Salvini and Di Maio, commanding 61%, according to a survey on Saturday. Salvini has toned down some hostility towards his former coalition partner and floated the idea of a reviving the League/5SM coalition under the condition that 5SM adopts a more constructive attitude to The League’s policies. Although the chances of another 5SM/Lega partnership are remote, it cannot be completely ruled out.</li></ul><p><strong>*SCHEDULE:</strong></p><ul><li>27th Aug – PD and 5SM to reconvene (1000BST/0500ET)</li><li>28th Aug – President Mattarella meets with PD (1700BST/1200ET) and 5SM (1800BST/1300ET)</li><li>27th Sep – Parliament starts reviewing budget law for 2020</li><li>15th Oct – 2020 Budget has to be submitted to the European Commission</li><li>20th Oct – 2020 Budget goes to the Italian Parliament</li></ul><p><strong>*RATING AGENCIES:</strong></p><ul><li>6th Sep – Moody’s to review Italy’s credit rating</li><li>25th Oct&nbsp; – S&amp;P to review Italy’s credit rating</li></ul>",

Furthermore, the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos and Chinese Industrial Profits returned to growth, although <strong>Hang Seng (Unch.)</strong> lagged amid a deluge of earnings, ongoing unrest and continued contraction in both Imports and Exports. Finally, 10yr JGBs weakened amid the improvement in risk sentiment and as prices homed in on the 155.00 level to the downside, although it eventually found some mild support following improved demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for super-long JGBs.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day reverse repo for a daily net injection of CNY 30bln.

(Newswires)</strong></p><p><strong>US President Trump said he wants a deal with China only if it is a good and fair deal for the US, while he thinks he will make a deal with China and is confident that China is sincere in wanting a trade deal</strong>. Trump reiterated criticisms that China is taking hundreds of billions per year from the US but also stated the US has collected tariffs of nearly USD 100bln and that China’s economy has recently taken a hit with 3mln jobs lost. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>UK PM Johnson said EU are tough negotiators but that does not mean UK will not get a deal, while he reiterated the backstop must be removed from the agreement</strong>. Furthermore, PM Johnson refused to rule out suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit, while he suggested that EU tends to take talks to the last minute and that if there is a no-deal, substantial sums would be made available to spend domestically from the EUR 39bln Brexit bill.

(Express)</p><p>UK PM Johnson's Europe Adviser David Frost will visit Brussels on Wednesday to discuss alternatives to Brexit plan. (Telegraph)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he thinks he will make a deal with the EU without imposing auto tariffs</strong> and suggested the EU are very hard to get a deal with, while he also reiterated criticism that US has been losing money to the UK. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Italy's 5-Star and PD were reportedly on track towards an agreement where Conte can return as PM according to two PD sources</strong>, while PD leader Zingaretti said the meeting with Di Maio was positive and talks are going ahead to form a new government in which he is optimistic a deal with 5-Star will be reached but declined to comment on Conte returning as PM. In addition, <strong>it was later reported that that coalition discussions between PD and Five Star will continue today and that talks are stuck regarding 2020 budget</strong>. (Newswires) However, the FT reported that activists from within the 5SM have threatened to desert the party if they enter into an agreement with the opposition PD party. (FT)&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> slightly pulled back to below 98.00 after the prior day’s gains which were spurred by the positive shift in tone from US President Trump at the G7, although its major counterparts remained subdued in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> struggled to hold above 1.1100 and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> at the bottom end of the 1.2200 handle after PM Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit and implicitly reiterated the view of not paying the divorce bill if there is no agreement. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> retraced some of the prior day’s rebound as it oscillated through the 106.00 level and <strong>antipodeans</strong> lacked firm direction amid choppy price action in <strong>CNH</strong> after the PBoC set the weakest reference rate in more than 11 years but at a firmer than expected level, with mild pressure in <strong>AUD</strong> seen following comments by RBA’s Debelle that the currency could have further to decline.</p><p>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle said floor rates in Australia are likely between 0.0%-0.5% and that they have looked closely at minimum rates in other developed countries but hope we never have to get down to those levels. Debelle also stated that AUD has come down some and may well go down further, while he added that a fall in AUD would be helpful and they would have to consider other option if rates decline to 0.5%. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were relatively flat overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures edged mild gains as price action steadied after the prior day’s swings where an initial advance was cut short by resistance just above the USD 55.00/bbl level, and as comments from French President Macron who hoped for a US-Iran summit, resulted to an unwinding of some of the geopolitical risk premium. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was relatively unchanged with the precious metal restricted by a slight pullback in USD and the improved risk tone, while <strong>copper</strong> prices conformed to the uneventful trade across the complex.&nbsp;</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p><strong>Iranian President Rouhani said he is open to talks with the West although there were separate reports that Iran has rejected French President Macron's proposal for negotiations</strong> over its ballistic missile programme and regional issues, while US President Trump suggested he would meet with Iran’s President if the circumstances were right. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasuries were in negative territory, largely on optimism regarding a medley of factors, although it is notable that yields, while largely recovering the downside seen on Friday, have not matched the optimism of equity markets, which were trading up by over a percent at one point. It has taken yields longer to rise (at the time equities were up around 1%, yields were only up by around 1bps across the curve; however, at pixel time, equities are off the highs by a margin, and yields are up around 3bps at the short end, and around 2bps at the long-end. Curve spreads are relative flat (+/- 1bps for the major spreads, at settlement); 2s10s once again entered inversion in the European afternoon, although it did not have a detrimental impact on the risk environment. Some traders are more interested by this week’s bund auctions, rather than Treasury auctions. The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (Tue, USD 40bln), new 5-year note (Wed, USD 41bln) and new 7-year note (Thu, USD 32bln). Analysts at UBS say this week will bring USD 85bln of cash (excluding SOMA holdings) but including around USD 76bln of redemption, as well as around USD 8.5bln of coupons. US T-note futures (U9) settled 5+ ticks lower at 130-25.</p><p>House Democrats are reportedly pushing a short-term funding bill that would keep the US Government running after 30th September.

        "content": "<p>Asia stock markets are higher as the region follows suit to the rebound across their global peers after US President Trump provided a more conciliatory tone at the G7 regarding US-China trade, while he was also optimistic about reaching a deal with EU and was open to meeting Iran President Rouhani under the right circumstances. ASX 200 (+0.6%) is led by the tech sector which is buoyed by the trade hopes and with retailers firmer after encouraging earnings from Wesfarmers, while Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) rides on the currency wave and eyes a reclaim of the 20.5k level. Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) are also positive with the mainland underpinned after US President Trump’s softer tone on China in which he suggested that negotiations will begin shortly and thinks a deal will be reached. Furthermore, the PBoC injected liquidity through reverse repos and Chinese Industrial Profits returned to growth, although Hong Kong lags amid a deluge of earnings, ongoing unrest and continued contraction in both Imports and Exports.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly pulled back to below the 98.00 level after the prior day’s gains which were spurred by the positive shift in tone from US President Trump at the G7, although its major counterparts remain subdued with EUR/USD just about kept afloat by support at 1.1100 and with GBP/USD at the bottom end of the 1.2200 handle after UK PM Johnson reiterated the view of not paying the divorce bill if there is no agreement and continued his refusal to rule out suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retraced some of the prior day’s rebound as it oscillates around the 106.00 level, while antipodeans lack firm direction amid the absence of key data and with choppy price action in CNH after the PBoC set the weakest reference rate in more than 11 years but at a firmer than expected level.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid the improvement in risk sentiment and as prices home in on the 155.00 level to the downside, while the looming enhanced liquidity auction for super-long JGBs also contributes to the lack of demand.</p>",
