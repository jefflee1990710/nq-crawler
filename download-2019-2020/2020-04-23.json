(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks and oil continued to rally overnight and into the US session, seeing the VIX fall beneath 40, with the latter leading the bounce back again. The gains found traction around the US cash equity open, where the Nikkei reported that the BoJ would consider limitless bond buying, and widen its purchases scope in the corporate sector, which provided support for fixed income. Economic data continues to be looked through: weekly initial jobless claims printed 4mln+ (although slightly better than some had feared), chunky declines in US March Housing Starts, while “worst ever” dips in the Markit PMIs on both sides of the pond were largely ignored. However, stocks skidded later in the session on an FT report that a Remdesivir (Gilead’s COVID-19 treatment) flopped in a Chinese clinical trial, bringing the SPX down around 35 handles to sub-2,800, where it lingered for the rest of the session. Gilead (GILD) was hit during hours on an FT report that its remdesivir had ‘flopped’, which saw the name halted at losses of 6%, although further details suggested all was not doom and gloom and pared back some of the initial losses. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, according to people familiar with the matter. Note, the chips it currently uses are from Intel (INTC) – Intel is due to report after the close today. Expedia Group (EXPE) is raising USD 3.2bln of new capital; 1.2bln of private placement perpetual preferred stock and 2bln of debt financing. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) warned of a loss up to USD 7.8bln amid the current oil rout. Target (TGT) digital sales in April rallied 275%, although QTD essential item sales fell 20%. Gap (GPS) is to suspend rent payments for closed stores due to COVID-19; existing cash and cash from operations may not be enough to fund operations; will take new liquidity measures in the next 12 months which will include a combination of debt and credit. SPX -0.09% at 2797, NDX -0.27% at 8642, DJIA +0.17% at 23,515.</p><p>T-Notes were firmer amid a paring of risk appetite after reports of poor results from a trial for Gilead’s COVID treatment Remdesivir. Treasuries, from the long-end, had already caught a bid heading into the US cash equity open after reports that the BoJ is to announce limitless asset purchases had accentuated the support for sovereigns on both sides of the Atlantic. As the Fed wrapped up its UST purchases for the day, yields began to rise higher in lieu of firmer equities and oil, as well as a corporate supply dump and 5-year TIPS auction. However, the negative Remdesivir update brought yields down to lows later in the session, as well as the lack of progress out of Europe in financing their virus response. Note that throughout the session, from the 5-year sector and inwards, yields saw little changes, with primarily the long-end gyrating; by settlement, 2s +1bps at 0.22%, 5s unchanged at 0.37%, 10s -1.5bps at 0.60%, 30s -3bps at 1.19%. Meanwhile, in short rates, another several bps decline in 3-month USD LIBOR supported white pack Eurodollar futures again, with the FRA-OIS spread declining further. T-notes (M0) settled 1 tick lower at 139-00+.</p>",

Earnings: Sanofi, Eni, Verizon.</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Stocks and oil continued to rally overnight and into the US session, seeing the VIX fall beneath 40, with the latter leading the bounce back again. The gains found traction around the US cash equity open, where the Nikkei reported that the BoJ would consider limitless bond buying, and widen its purchases scope in the corporate sector, which provided support for fixed income. Economic data continues to be looked through: weekly initial jobless claims printed 4mln+ (although slightly better than some had feared), chunky declines in US March Housing Starts, while “worst ever” dips in the Markit PMIs on both sides of the pond were largely ignored. However, stocks skidded later in the session on an FT report that a Remdesivir (Gilead’s COVID-19 treatment) flopped in a Chinese clinical trial, bringing the SPX down around 35 handles to sub-2,800, where it lingered for the rest of the session. Meanwhile, the VIX rose back above 40. Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs on VIX, stated that while it has eased recently, it is still by no means low, citing the September future back at its high despite May falling recently, nodding to participants pricing in a longer period of volatility; the bank says the key thing to watch is liquidity, which in equities remains a concern around the final minutes of US equity trading sessions. Credit Suisse also draws attention to SPX volume, saying that as the market has found support, volume has fallen (albeit still elevated), which to the bank, indicates recent strength as a corrective/bear market rally, “Key now as to whether we are indeed looking at a more serious bear trend will be whether volume starts to indeed rise again if the market resumes its fall.”</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Thursday (via state official health departments) against Wednesday:</strong></i></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NEW YORK</strong>: death toll rises 2.9% at 15,740 (prev. +3.2% at 15,302).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY:</strong> cases +1.4% at 189,973 (prev. + 1.8% at 187,327); death toll +1.9% at 25,549 (prev. +1.8% at 25,083).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FRANCE: </strong>death toll +2.4% at 21,856 (prev. 21,340).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK: </strong>cases rise to 138,078 (prev. 133,495), death toll rises to 18,738 (prev. 18,100); deaths rise by 616 (+3.52%) vs. yesterday's increase of 759 (+4.4%).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CANADA: </strong>cases +4.9% at 40,824 (prev. +4.6% 38,922); death toll +8.3% at 2028 (prev. +7.6% at 1871).</p><p><strong>REMDESIVIR: </strong>Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir flopped in the first randomised clinical trial, according to draft documents posted accidentally by the WHO and cited by the FT. The Chinese study did not improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream; the study included 237 patients, 79 of which were placebos. Gilead said the results are inconclusive as it was terminated early due to low enrollment, reducing the ability to draw statistically significant conclusions; added that data trends are still showing a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly for patients treated earlier on. The announcement saw a sharp drop in the SPX, although recovered some ground as participants evaluated some of the less bad than expected details of the story. However, some participants are taking caution from Gilead’s optimistic comments, citing it as a formality/norm for a pharma company to defend their drugs. Conversely, those sceptical of China - including CNBC’s Kramer who said he is hearing positive things from other studies in the US - highlight the study as perhaps not reliable due to potential for political interference.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 2.72/BBL HIGHER AT USD 16.50/BBL, (N0) SETTLED USD 0.75 HIGHER AT 21.44/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 0.96 HIGHER AT 21.33/BBL; (N0) SETTLED USD 0.73 HIGHER AT USD 24.79/BBL.</strong></p><p>The energy complex lead risk appetite forward again on Thursday in lack of any major changes to the fundamental backdrop. Front-month oil futures continued to rise in the overnight session from Wednesday’s gains, catching further momentum as the US session commenced. However, later in the afternoon amid the risk-off tone induced by the negative remdisivir update, oil and equity futures pared a significant portion of their strength. Meanwhile, the potential for a geopolitical risk premium has been noted by participants amid Trump’s latest rhetoric against Iran, suggesting the US would shoot Iranian boats that got to close to US ones. However, a later US statement said there had been no change in the rules on engagement. Citi’s analysts, in reference to reports OPEC could start cuts sooner than anticipated, noted that the “ fact of the matter is that OPEC would have trouble selling the barrels if they were to maintain recent production through the end of the month.” The bank says the larger issue revolves around storage and as oil prices rise, the downside risk increases.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>LOCKDOWN:</strong> NIH’s Fauci said a mitigation program of physical distancing has worked and is the basis for being able to think seriously about reopening, but added we’re not finished and need to proceed in a careful and measured way. Furthermore, Fauci suggested the coronavirus will return in the fall, and the US’ response will determine whether it is big or small. Meanwhile, President Trump said the number of new coronavirus cases continues to decline, and more states will soon be in a position to reopen gradually. Furthermore, Trump also signed into effect the immigration order, which will be in place for 60 days, and then which the White House will decide whether or not to extend it or not.</p><p><strong>CHINA</strong> is to purchase over 30mln tonnes of crops for state stockpile given COVID-19, the majority of these farm goods are to come from the US, according to sources. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US is calling on China to close wildlife wet markets and those selling illegal wildlife permanently. At the same time, Pompeo added that the US has concerns that Beijing’s upstream dam operations have altered flows of the Mekong and suggested the Chinese Communist Party is coercing neighbours in the South China Sea, even going as far as sinking a Vietnamese vessel.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>EU RECOVERY FUND: </strong>EU leaders failed to come to an agreement on its recovery crisis package. Heading into the meeting there was a continued divide between Northern and Southern states on whether it should be financed through grants or loans; Spain &amp; Italy called for grants to avoid raising debt levels. Some had pointed towards June or July to find more clarity on what is needed, despite some of the worst hit regions (Italy, Spain, France) calling for an imminent response; Macron after called for a quick and strong response worth 5-10% of GDP, noting “Europe has no future if a response cannot be found to this exceptional shock”. The issue on coronabonds seems to be put behind us with large objections prior to the meeting, and even French President Macron noted the issue was not with mutualised debt, but solely on grants or loans. The decision now has been put on the commission, where Pantheon Macroeconomics states this can be seen as a positive as they will be friendly towards the Southern nations, however time is short. European Commission President Von Der Leyen noted that they will propose an increase of budget headroom to raise funds against guarantees from member states and that It suggests the funding be front loaded by finding a balance between grants and loans, adding a recovery fund will be used to mobilise EUR 1trln worth of recovery investment. Given the delay, Pantheon Macroeconomics writes the economy is in free fall and southern governments have an incentive to not provide support, knowing in the future a larger package can be tapped, rather than using their own national budgets, which “could be devastating for the economy in the near term”. Pantheon still sees the path towards a substantial package with “all the bells and whistles” of debt mutualisation, although it will likely be used to clean up the mess, rather than preventing it.</p><p><strong>GERMANY: </strong>German coalition parties agreed to further measures to protect workers and companies from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic which includes higher state transfers in short-time work scheme to cover up to 80% of lost net income and will increase state wage support until year-end. Furthermore, the parties agreed to temporarily lower tax burden for catering industry through lower VAT rate and are also said to plan more tax relief for companies by simplifying loss carry forward.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>BOJ </strong>is to consider unlimited bond-buying at its meeting next week, may double purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper; plans to keep the negative rate and YYC goal unchanged, Nikkei reported, seeing JPY offered while global equities and sovereigns caught a bid. In the report, “Purchases of government bonds to eliminate the prospect for the current year 80 trillion yen, will be discussed in a direction to buy rather than limit the amount required. With regard to commercial paper (CP) and corporate bonds issued by companies for financing, it is expected that the purchase limit will be doubled”. Next week’s MPM will see the Japanese central bank factor in the impact of COVID-19 and oil price declines on its inflation and growth views. We will also get an initial look at 2022 projections. JPMorgan’s analysts expect the BOJ will announce a pessimistic near-term growth outlook with caution about further downside risk for the economy, but at the same time emphasise that growth will rebound in 2H20 and FY2021 strongly. “The important point is that the BoJ likely will admit as well that the upward momentum of inflation will be lost temporarily, but likely will emphasise that it will return after the COVID-19 outbreak is contained.” The BOJ has previously committed to enacting further easing if it judges that there has been a loss of upward momentum in inflation pressures; “Seeing the current economic and financial conditions, we expect that the BOJ will conduct further expansion of QE, and we also expect that the BoJ will emphasise that it will cooperate with the government by maintaining the yield curve at around the current targets even when the government increases the issuance of JGBs, which will strengthen the stimulative impact of the economic package, for which the Cabinet decided to increase.” Essentially, this would not imply a rate cut, but instead, an expansion of the monetary base. “When the government increases spending, this policy mix would be equivalent to the fiscal spending with unlimited QE,” JPM explains, with the bank not seeing a rate cut since it is trying to encourage banks to lend more to firms, and lower rates would hit lending margins; JPM says the focus for the bank is how to alleviate the funding difficulty of firms more.</p><p><strong>FED: </strong>The April meeting is unlikely to produce any new announcements on its asset purchases, and the Fed is mulling an expansion of its main street lending program to non-profits and preparing to extend the municipal lending program to more local governments, the WSJ reported. As liquidity conditions return to more normal levels in the market, participants and now looking ahead to how the Fed will evolve its asset purchases, with the expectation that purchases will be tapered further to bring amounts more similar to clips seen in previous rounds of QE.</p><p><strong>PBOC </strong>may refrain from rolling over CNY 267.4bln of Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) maturing on Friday as the objective to boost lending to SMEs may have been covered by the recent liquidity provisions, according to the CSJ.</p><p><strong>ECB: </strong>Villeroy said that “Inflation is low today, and we expect it to remain low afterwards. This will allow us to maintain low interest rates and abundant liquidity for companies in difficulty.” Meanwhile, Lagarde told EU leaders that GDP could fall by 5% and up to 15% due to COVID-19. An ABN AMRO scenario analysis noted that 1) if existing lockdowns continue until the end of April (base case) 2020 GDP would contract by 4.5%. 2) if existing lockdowns continue until the end of May (negative case) 2020 GDP would contract by 8%. 3) if existing lockdowns continue until the end of April but consumer behaviour normalises at a quicker pace (positive case), the real economy could recover sharply but would benefit less in 2021 as stimulus efforts will be less aggressive.</p><p>Earlier this month, EU official stated that they expect GDP to contract as much as 10%</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>Vlieghe said it seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries; economy’s potential is severely disrupted at the moment but, once the pandemic is over, and other things equal, in principle it should return approximately to the pre-virus trajectory.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>T-NOTES (M0) SETTLED 1 TICK LOWER AT 139-00+.</strong></p><p>T-Notes were firmer amid a paring of risk appetite after reports of poor results from a trial for Gilead’s COVID treatment Remdesivir. Treasuries, from the long-end, had already caught a bid heading into the US cash equity open after reports that the BoJ is to announce limitless asset purchases had accentuated the support for sovereigns on both sides of the Atlantic. As the Fed wrapped up its UST purchases for the day, yields began to rise higher in lieu of firmer equities and oil, as well as a corporate supply dump and 5-year TIPS auction. However, the negative Remdesivir update brought yields down to lows later in the session, as well as the lack of progress out of Europe in financing their virus response. Note that throughout the session, from the 5-year sector and inwards, yields saw little changes, with primarily the long-end gyrating; by settlement, 2s +1bps at 0.22%, 5s unchanged at 0.37%, 10s -1.5bps at 0.60%, 30s -3bps at 1.19%. Meanwhile, in short rates, another several bps decline in 3-month USD LIBOR supported white pack Eurodollar futures again, with the FRA-OIS spread declining further.</p><p>The session saw around a dozen issuers across US corporates and foreign issuers, including the Bank of England again (USD 2bln). Morgan Stanley (3bln) and Wells Fargo (6bln) were among the corporates to raise debt; following from Bank of America on Wednesday and JPMorgan last week – high rated issuers/banks are likely finding confidence in issuing in current conditions as IG spreads come in, or perhaps fearful of future conditions. Since the latest oil price collapse, the high yield sector has been under pressure with spreads rising; note the heavyweight of energy sector loans that saturate the high yield market. The divergence between IG and HY spreads is likely also in part due to the Fed, where it currently only provides support for recently downgraded to junk corporates (“fallen angels”), a marginal section of the HY market; desks draw attention to rising chances of funding pressures rising again if the low oil prices continue to see HY spread widening, in addition to potential fallout/contagion effects.</p><p><strong>US FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT: </strong>Treasury to sell (USD) 42bln of 2-year notes on April 27th (prev. 40bln); 43bln of 5-year notes on April 27th (prev. 41bln); 35bln of 7-year notes on April 28th (prev. 32bln) - all to settle on April 30th. To sell USD 22bln of FRNs on April 28th, to settle on April 30th.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.09% at 2797, NDX -0.27% at 8642, DJIA +0.17% at 23,515.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy +3.01%, Industrials +0.77%, Communication Svs +0.71%, Materials +0.54%, Health +0.48%, Cons Disc +0.32%, Financials -0.43%, Technology -0.69%, Cons Stpl -1.02%, Real Estate -1.19%, Utilities -1.76%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Gilead (GILD) was hit during hours on an FT report that its remdesivir had ‘flopped’, which saw the name halted at losses of 6%, although further details suggested all was not doom and gloom and pared back some of the initial losses. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, according to people familiar with the matter. Note, the chips it currently uses are from Intel (INTC) – Intel is due to report after the close today. Expedia Group (EXPE) is raising USD 3.2bln of new capital; 1.2bln of private placement perpetual preferred stock and 2bln of debt financing. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) warned of a loss up to USD 7.8bln amid the current oil rout. Target (TGT) digital sales in April rallied 275%, although QTD essential item sales fell 20%. Gap (GPS) is to suspend rent payments for closed stores due to COVID-19; existing cash and cash from operations may not be enough to fund operations; will take new liquidity measures in the next 12 months which will include a combination of debt and credit. Delta Airlines (DAL) announced it intends to enter a USD 1.5bln credit facility due 2023. It also plans to commence a private offering of USD 1.5bln of senior secured notes due 2025.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Lam Research (LRCX) missed on EPS, revenue was in line, while it announced demand for its goods remains strong. Xilinx (XLNX) beat on the top and bottom line, although Q1 revenue view fell short of expectations.&nbsp; SK Hynix (HXSCL, 000660) beat on net profit and operating profit. Eli-Lilly (LLY) beat on EPS and revenue, while it widened its guidance. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) missed on EPS and revenue, while announcing it suspended its share repurchase programme, although was an outperformer after it gave an optimistic outlook on returning to business in Asia.</p><p><strong>SPX TECHNICALS:</strong> Credit Suisse views the equity rebound as temporary and looks for gap and downtrend resistance at 2820/36 as a cap for further strength, to then fall to a retest of 2729/21. On the contrary, Credit Suisse says that if strength as to extend in the SPX above 2836, that would curtail thoughts of a near-term top, and instead open the door to a test of 2879/83, and potentially even as far as 2934.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Initial jobless claims printed 4.43mln this week (analysts had expected somewhere between 3.0-55mln), taking the cumulative tally over the last five weeks to 26.45mln. The series has also seen its third consecutive lower printing, which will be encouraging (some had forecast an increase due to the historical relationship of claims rising after holiday weeks.” Pantheon Macroeconomics says it was a horrendous number, but it sees a further decline in claims next week, noting the fall of Google searches for “file for unemployment” has slowed, suggesting it will take several more weeks before claims drop below one million. Note that in the single worst week after the crash of 2008, claims rose 665K. In terms of the implications for the April employment situation report, this week’s jobless claims coincide with the BLS’ jobs report survey period, and Pantheon’s tentative forecasts look for nonfarm payrolls to shed around 21mln jobs in the month, and May payrolls seen declining by 9mln; Pantheon believes that the June report will largely depend on how far states are able to re-open their economies, especially in the discretionary consumer services sector, where most of the first wave of jobs disappeared after the lockdowns.</p><p><strong>UK FLASH PMI: </strong>The composite saw a steep fall to 12.9 (exp. 31.4, prev. 36). Manufacturing fell deeper than expected to 32.9 from 47.8; new orders, employment and production components saw severely negative influences. Services saw an even steeper decline to 12.3 from 34.5, eclipsing the expected print of 29. Credit Suisse note manufacturing softened by a modest reduction in stocks of purchases, and supplier delivery times; despite the problem being a supply problem rather than high demand. The report noted this was consistent with GDP falling at a roughly 7% rate but could be even greater as the PMI excludes the vast majority of self-employed and the retail sector, which have been hard hit by COVID-19.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>FX WRAP:</strong> USD gains came to a halt today, while risk sentiment continues to improve despite continued dismal data, which many seem to be looking past. Positive risk appetite and poor data have seen the dollar come off its recent highs and lower on the day, although DXY remains above 100 with some support from a weaker EUR as the EU failed to reach an agreement. Note, on US data, RBC believes the jobless claims data continues to lag and that there have already been between 20-25mln unemployed from the hardest-hit sectors.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen traded slightly firmer against the buck despite reports suggesting unlimited bond buys are coming from the BoJ at its policy meeting next week.&nbsp; Some note that the programme may not live up to standards given the flat yield curve and low rates, elsewhere amid the coronavirus pandemic analysts point out repatriation into JPY after investors initially were seeking more risk prior to the virus.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling picked up in line with equities and largely ignored this morning’s weak PMI data with perhaps more focus on the GBP 180bln issuance from the DMO to reflect the higher financing needs in Q2. However, risk sentiment deteriorated after negative remdesivir reports and that the EU failed to come to an agreement in its recovery package. However, Cable remains flat/marginally higher on the day, perhaps with GBP buoyed by EUR weakness.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> PMI’s were dismal, as can be expected. Focus was on the Eurogroup leaders response to the coronavirus recovery. Which came to no agreement, issues remain on whether grants or loans should be used with opposition remaining from northern states. The news saw an already weaker EUR extend on losses with EURUSD residing above 1.0750 after falling beneath 1.08 earlier in the session.</p><p><strong>AUD / NZD:</strong> Both antipodeans performed well today in line with risk. Overnight, Australia trade data which saw a surplus of 12.3bln, with exports +29% and imports +10%. Data in New Zealand was not so great, with credit card spending, as you would expect, fell 9% M/M, and 8% Y/Y. Westpac believes the RBA’s forecast of -10% GDP in H1, and +4% for H2 is in line with their view, although the desk is less optimistic on the recovery in 2021. On AUDUSD, Westpac see the cross tilted back towards 0.60-0.62, noting risks on its key commodity prices are clearly lower, while dismal activity and earnings data is hurting risk appetite.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was mixed, while Rub continued to benefit from the gains in oil. However, MXN was weaker yet again continuing its declines amid austerity measures from President AMLO to save USD 25bln, which ING note highlights Obrador’s aversion to debt and bailouts. Elsewhere, BRL weaker against the buck amid source reports in Estadão and Folha de São Paulo that President Bolsonaro has reportedly tried to impose a change in Federal Policy, which saw Justice Minister Sergio Morto try to resign, although Bolsonaro rejected it, which shows further divide among parliament after the Health Minister was fired recently.</p>",

        "content": "<p>EU leaders failed to come to an agreement on its recovery crisis package. Heading into the meeting there was a continued divide between Northern and Southern states on whether it should be financed through grants or loans; Spain &amp; Italy called for grants to avoid raising debt levels. Some had pointed towards June or July to find more clarity on what is needed, despite some of the worst hit regions (Italy, Spain, France) calling for an imminent response; Macron after called for a quick and strong response worth 5-10% of GDP, noting “Europe has no future if a response cannot be found to this exceptional shock”. The issue on coronabonds seems to be put behind us with large objections prior to the meeting, and even French President Macron noted the issue was not with mutualised debt, but solely on grants or loans. The decision now has been put on the commission, where Pantheon Macroeconomics states this can be seen as a positive as they will be friendly towards the Southern nations, however time is short. European Commission President Von Der Leyen noted that they will propose an increase of budget headroom to raise funds against guarantees from member states and that It suggests the funding be front loaded by finding a balance between grants and loans, adding a recovery fund will be used to mobilise EUR 1trln worth of recovery investment. Given the delay, Pantheon Macroeconomics writes the economy is in free fall and southern governments have an incentive to not provide support, knowing in the future a larger package can be tapped, rather than using their own national budgets, which “could be devastating for the economy in the near term”. Pantheon still sees the path towards a substantial package with “all the bells and whistles” of debt mutualisation, although it will likely be used to clean up the mess, rather than preventing it.&nbsp;</p>",

Overnight, Australia trade data which saw a surplus of 12.3bln, with exports +29% and imports +10%. Data in New Zealand was not so great, with credit card spending, as you would expect, fell 9% M/M, and 8% Y/Y. Westpac believes the RBA’s forecast of -10% GDP in H1, and +4% for H2 is in line with their view, although the desk is less optimistic on the recovery in 2021. On AUDUSD, Westpac see the cross tilted back towards 0.60-0.62, noting risks on its key commodity prices are clearly lower, while dismal activity and earnings data is hurting risk appetite.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was mixed, while Rub continued to benefit from the gains in oil. However, MXN was weaker yet again continuing its declines amid austerity measures from President AMLO to save USD 25bln, which ING note highlights Obrador’s aversion to debt and bailouts. Elsewhere, BRL weaker against the buck amid source reports in Estadão and Folha de São Paulo that President Bolsonaro has reportedly tried to impose a change in Federal Policy, which saw Justice Minister Sergio Morto try to resign, although Bolsonaro rejected it, which shows further divide among parliament after the Health Minister was fired recently.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>T-Notes were firmed amid a paring of risk appetite after reports of poor results from a trial for Gilead’s COVID treatment Remdesivir. Treasuries, from the long-end, had already caught a bid heading into the US cash equity open after reports that the BoJ is to announce limitless asset purchases had accentuated the support for sovereigns on both sides of the Atlantic. As the Fed wrapped up its UST purchases for the day, yields began to rise higher in lieu of firmer equities and oil, as well as a corporate supply dump and 5-year TIPS auction. However, the negative Remdesivir update brought yields down to lows later in the session, as well as the lack of progress out of Europe in financing their virus response. Note that throughout the session, from the 5-year sector and inwards, yields saw little changes, with primarily the long-end gyrating; by settlement, 2s +1bps at 0.22%, 5s unchanged at 0.37%, 10s -1.5bps at 0.60%, 30s -3bps at 1.19%. Meanwhile, in short rates, another several bps decline in 3-month USD LIBOR supported white pack Eurodollar futures again, with the FRA-OIS spread declining further.</li><li>The session saw around a dozen issuers across US corporates and foreign issuers, including the Bank of England again (USD 2bln). Morgan Stanley (3bln) and Wells Fargo (6bln) were among the corporates to raise debt; following from Bank of America on Wednesday and JPMorgan last week – high rated issuers/banks are likely finding confidence in issuing in current conditions as IG spreads come in, or perhaps fearful of future conditions. Since the latest oil price collapse, the high yield sector has been under pressure with spreads rising; note the heavyweight of energy sector loans that saturate the high yield market. The divergence between IG and HY spreads is likely also in part due to the Fed, where it currently only provides support for recently downgraded to junk corporates (“fallen angels”), a marginal section of the HY market; desks draw attention to rising chances of funding pressures rising again if the low oil prices continue to see HY spread widening, in addition to potential fallout/contagion effects.</li><li><strong>US FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT:&nbsp;</strong>Treasury to sell (USD) 42bln of 2-year notes on April 27th&nbsp;(prev. 40bln); 43bln of 5-year notes on April 27th&nbsp;(prev. 41bln); 35bln of 7-year notes on April 28th&nbsp;(prev. 32bln) - all to settle on April 30th.

Front-month oil futures continued to rise in the overnight session from Wednesday’s gains, catching further momentum as the US session commenced. However, later in the afternoon amid the risk-off tone induced by the negative remdisivir update, oil and equity futures pared a significant portion of their strength. Meanwhile, the potential for a geopolitical risk premium has been noted by participants amid Trump’s latest rhetoric against Iran, suggesting the US would shoot Iranian boats that got to close to US ones. However, a later US statement said there had been no change in the rules on engagement. Citi’s analysts, in reference to reports OPEC could start cuts sooner than anticipated, noted that the “fact of the matter is that OPEC would have trouble selling the barrels if they were to maintain recent production through the end of the month.” The bank says the larger issue revolves around storage and as oil prices rise, the downside risk increases.</li></ul>",

Usd/Jpy seemed intent if not destined to test anything left defending 107.00, like option expiries between 107.30-25 in 1.5 bn before snapping back sharply and marginally piercing 108.00 just ahead of the NY cut where 1.6 bn rolled off from 107.85-108.00, while Yen crosses performed similar reversals. However, broader Dollar weakness in wake of sub-forecast US Markit PMIs culminated in the headline pair drifting back from peaks as the <strong>DXY</strong> retreated to a new session low closer to drifted to a wards 100.200 session lows vs 100.690 at best.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Antipodes were already bid and trying to extend latest rebounds vs their US rival, so the Greenback’s reversal merely added fuel to the recovery effort with the Kiwi reaching 0.6040 and Aussie able to peer over 0.6400. Meanwhile, the Loonie was relatively late to join in even though crude prices were drawing more lines in the sand and clawing back lost ground to the benefit of other oil-driven currencies, such as the Norwegian Krona, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso. Nevertheless, Usd/Cad is now eyeing 1.4000 compared to almost 1.4200 at one stage, with Eur/<strong>NOK </strong>hovering near 11.4300 vs 11.6900+, Usd/<strong>RUB</strong> around 74.3300 within a 75.9900-74.2450 range and Usd/<strong>MXN</strong> circa 24.5000 between 24.3245-6470 parameters.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound has performed remarkably well in the face of dismal UK surveys in the form of IHS PMIs and CBI Trends plus Q2 Business optimism that was more akin to pessimism. Indeed, having survived an attempt on 1.2300, Cable subsequently peered above 1.2400, albeit as the Buck was buckling, while Eur/Gbp only bounced partially from 0.8710 and remains close to the 200 DMA despite an arguably more impressive Euro revival from post-abject Eurozone PMI depths. Eur/Usd lost grip of the 1.0800 handle and breached support at 1.0769 before finding a base at a Fib retracement level (1.0757) and roaring back up to eclipse the prior session high and pulling up a few pips shy of 1.0850.

A decline in EPS expectations inevitably impacts S&amp;P 500 cash flows and, eventually, dividend policies. The S&amp;P 500 could see a 28% drop in its dividend due to the pressure on EPS expectations alone, UBS says, with energy and Industrials most at risk of dividend cuts; Health Care names, however, are likely to see an increase in dividends. According to the bank's screener, the top 10 US stocks with the largest projected dividend cuts are: BA, CVX, WYNN, XOM, VLO, OXY, HP, RCL, VTR, VNO.</p><p><strong>STILL WATCHING OIL:</strong> Although stock markets have stabilised/bounced-back from the \"reverse oil shock\", Nomura's quant desk still thinks it presumptuous to definitively declare that the oil disturbance is over since many short-term crude investors appear to be unclear about what to do next. \"In particular, trend-following investors like CTAs and risk-parity funds look quite disengaged, so for the moment at least, it looks as though oil prices have managed to avoid coming under the influence of systematic downward pressure.\" But, trend following algos seem to be eying further downside. \"We see a risk that WTI crude oil prices could swing negative again if CTAs and other technical investors start making more trades that recognize the novel possibility of negative prices,\" Nomura writes.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*OVERVIEW: </strong>The EU27 are poised to sign off on the plans concocted by EZ finance ministers, and brainstorm on a long-term recovery plan. Leaders have signalled a general will for a larger coordinated fiscal response, albeit views seem to differ. Officials noted that the North fears that their financial positions will be contaminated by debt mutualisation in the future due to decisions taken by the South. The European Council is expected to discuss the size of a European Recovery Fund alongside other financing tools. The virtual meeting will be chaired by EU Council President Michel at 1400BST, although the lack of detailed proposals could see another impasse or delay in talks.</p><p><strong>*EU RECOVERY FUND</strong>: The Council President said the Fund should be established as soon as possible to kick-start economy once lockdown measures are eased, but officials note of a large divide between member states on the size and whether it should consist of only grants or solely loans. Consensus on a Recovery Fund this week has been heavily downplayed, with officials pointing to more clarity in June or July. In terms of the nuances, Spain is to propose a EUR 1.5tln recovery fund backed by perpetual bonds to finance the recovery of the worst-hit countries in grants and not loans, to avoid rising debt. France has backed the principals in Spain’s proposal but noted a physical meeting will be needed for a formal decision, potentially before Summer – President Macron previously said there is no choice but to set up a joint EUR 400bln recovery fund. <strong>An EU Commission noted stated that EU recovery plan could trigger EUR 2tln of spending and investment</strong> (modestly below some reports of EUR 2.2tln), recovery find would allow Commission to raise EUR 320bln on the market (in-fitting with sources). The note added around half of the EUR 320bln would be loans (unclear on the allocation for the rest). The final repayment decision on repayment could be taken by EU leaders in 2034, net budget would only cover interest on borrowing of EUR 500mln loans/year on average and <strong>the legal text could be endorsed in June – although an official said the fund could be launched on January 1st 2021.</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/7e64a1e5-add0-4d75-8dae-16a79af0d4ff.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>*EUROGROUP FALLOUT</strong>: At the Eurogroup meeting, Finance Ministers agreed on a EUR 540bln rescue package which consists of:</p><ul><li><strong>ESM CREDIT LINE (up to 2% of Euro Area GDP)</strong>: This will be immediately available for member states with “light” conditionality. The size could be up to USD 240bln should all countries tap the maximum available. This also opens the door to Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) by the ECB, which allows the Central Bank to purchase unlimited debt from the worst-hit regions, albeit some analysts have suggested that the OMT programme has already been made redundant by the ECB's new PEPP.</li><li><strong>FIRMING EIB ACTIVITIES (up to 1.6% of Euro Area GDP): </strong>The European Investment Bank could support EUR 200bln of company financings, with emphasis on SMEs.</li><li><strong>SHORT-TIME WORK SCHEME (0.8% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> The EUR 100bln scheme was drafted to aid protect jobs and workers hit by the pandemic in the form of loans on “favourable” terms.</li></ul><p><strong>*CORONABOND: </strong>The common debt issuances pursued namely by Spain and Italy was not included in the Eurogroup’s draft document after experiencing pushback by several larger members, vehemently from Austria, Germany and Netherlands. However, Italy seems to be erring towards a compromise on the issue. Italian PM Conte, at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, signalled open-mindedness towards the ESM credit line and an alternative fund as a substitute to Eurobonds. Desks note that this should reduce tail risks for a roadblock.</p><p><strong>*ITALY’S DILEMMA: </strong>PM Conte set a high bar for success in negotiations for a post-virus response as domestic pressure builds at the epicentre of the European outbreak. Desks note that the PM will need a win to confine the rising Eurosceptics whilst fending off opposition parties waiting to muster support from any failures. Despite Conte’s more recent sanguine tone regarding a Coronabond compromise, participants believe the PM could be tempted to walk away from the table, having had battled for weeks on a Euro-wide debt instrument<strong>. The details surrounding the Recovery Fund could prove to be sticking point in negotiations. Italy stated that they cannot wait for June for approval – this could threaten a breakdown in negotiations. </strong>Meanwhile, domestic pushback could arise from a compromise of just ESM lines – potentially paving a way for a change in government. It’s also worth noting that S&amp;P will be reviewing Italy’s sovereign debt on Friday; the agency will be eyeing the outcome of negotiations. Credit Suisse believes that the survival of the Euro could be at risk if EU leaders fail to understand the difficultly in Italy’s economical and political landscapes.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.4%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp.

A meeting which could see disagreement over the rollout of the European Recovery Fund – officials touting a launched in 2021; however, Italy stated they cannot wait until June 2020 for approval. European bourses trade mixed with no standout under/outperformers, whilst broader sectors also paint a mixed picture and fail to reflect a clear risk tone – albeit the energy sector outperforms as the complex continues to post gains. The breakdown also sees a similarly mixed picture – again with Oil &amp; Gas leading the gains. A slew of earnings were reported in the pre-market, including prelim figures for Daimler (+0.9%) and Software AG (+0.8%), whilst Renault (+2.3%), Orange (+0.5%), Pernod Ricard (+0.3%), Accor (+1.1%), Swedbank (-0.7%), Volvo (-7.0%) all reported quarterly numbers – with Renault firmer despite a downbeat earnings release on reports Renault CEO is to unveil cost-cutting measures next month, whilst Volvo is pressured after substantially missing on its EPS and adj. operating profit expectations. Moving to Credit Suisse’s (-2.2%) earnings, the group topped net income forecasts but reported a deterioration in revenue and a Q1 loan loss provision over double its expectations. That being said, market volatility saw its FICC and Equity trading and sales both higher in excess of 20% YY. Elsewhere, Wirecard (+8.0%) sees itself at the top of the DAX after an independent audit of the Co. has uncovered no substantial findings with regards to questionable accounting methods; however, the full report is yet to be published. Results from the audit are now expected for April 27th and the Co’s FY results are to be published on April 30th. Finally, Tullow Oil (+30%) opened with gains above 60% and holds its place at the top of the Stoxx 600 after divesting its stake in Uganda to reduce net debt, whilst also seeing tailwinds from favourable price action in oil.</p><p><strong>Eli Lilly and Co (LLY)</strong> Q1 20 (USD): Adj. EPS 1.75 (exp. 1.48), Revenue 5.86bln (exp. 5.51bln). FY Non-GAAP EPS view 6.70-6.90 (exp. 6.73); FY20 guidance unchanged</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> The single currency is languishing at the bottom of the G10 table and looking precarious under 1.0800 vs the Dollar not to mention across the board as Eur/crosses teeter over psychological or key technical levels, like Eur/Chf on the verge of 1.0500, Eur/Jpy edging towards 116.00 and even Eur/Gbp testing the 200 DMA (0.8736). Much worse than anticipated preliminary Eurozone PMIs, and particularly poor services sector prints have undermined the Euro, but Eur/Usd is holding in just above or around chart supports ahead of 1.0750 in the form of April 6’s so called reaction low at 1.0769 and a 1.0757 Fib retracement level, for now, with some additional buffers provided by option expiries extending from 1.0800-1.0790 to 1.0750 in 3.1 bn and 1.2 bn respectively.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/JPY/GBP -</strong> The Kiwi and Aussie continue to see-saw vs their US counterpart, with the former recovering from a stop-induced slide overnight after 0.5900 held and subsequently retesting resistance ahead of 0.6000, while the latter was able to withstand weak PMIs with the aid of trade data revealing a much wider surplus as exports outpaced imports nearly 3-fold. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6300+ status and briefly extended gains to circa 0.6370 before fading alongside Aud/Nzd ahead of 1.0650. Meanwhile, the Yen continues to retain an underlying safe-haven bid between 108.00 and 107.50 with decent option expiry interest also keeping the pair contained (1 bn at 107.50 and 1.6 bn from 107.85 to 108.00). Elsewhere, Sterling has (somehow) taken bleak UK PMI and CBI surveys in stride and resisting Greenback advances after Cable came close to filling bids touted at 1.2300, though this could be due to the aforementioned Eur/Gbp correction from recent 0.8800+ peaks rather than anything especially or uniquely Pound positive.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Buck may be primed for a fall after the latest US initial claims release and/or Markit PMIs, but for now the DXY is establishing a more assured base on the 100.000 handle and building momentum through 100.500, albeit with indirect traction from the Euro underperformance noted above and more pronounced Franc depreciation below 0.9700 through 0.9750.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> The Scandi Crowns are back on the front foot as crude prices continue to stabilise and sharp falls in Swedish sentiment indicators are acknowledged, but partially taken in context when compared to the starker deterioration elsewhere in Europe. However, in contrast to crude-related recoveries for EM currencies like the Rouble, COVID-19 contagion has intensified in SA where the Rand is back under 19.0000 vs the Dollar in the run up to President Ramaphosa setting out plans to re-open the economy after rolling out fiscal stimulus representing around 10% of the country’s GDP..</p><p>Australian CBA Manufacturing PMI (Apr P) 45.6 (Prev. 49.7).

However, <strong>UK debt</strong> stands alone above parity between 136.98-135.93 Liffe parameters, while <strong>Bunds </strong>have topped out within their 172.20-171.29 Eurex range amidst ongoing outperformance at the Eurozone margins post-ECB fallen angel collateral assistance and pre-EU videoconference to try and launch a fiscal recovery fund. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> have been largely side-lined, but impending data (namely weekly jobless claims) and preliminary Markit PMIs are likely to arouse more price action ahead of supply vibes from next week’s auction schedule and possibly results of the 5 year TIPS sale.</p><p>UK Gov't intend to issue GBP 180bln worth of bonds for May-July period, will not detail maturity split for the year at this stage; further details on June 29th; Expects a significantly higher proportion of issuance will occur in first 4-months of financial year, does not believe the high issuance volume will be required for the entire period. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front month futures trade on a firmer footing as geopolitical risks continue to be priced in following US President Trump’s tweet regarding his order to the US Navy to shoot down all Iranian gunboats that harass US vessels. Aside from that, the underlying fundamentals remain broadly unchanged. The supply glut remains, and storage space remains scarce. “Given the glut we have in the oil market, it is difficult to see this offering lasting support to the market, unless the situation does escalate further” – ING says. Elsewhere and in fitting with recent source reports, Saudi Aramco has started to implement the OPEC+ pact ahead of its inauguration on May 1st. Aramco will be lower output to 8.5mln BPD, the output level mentioned under the terms of the of the deal – markets are yet to see if other producers follow suit, with Kuwait the only other country to publicly announce their early cuts thus far. WTI resides around USD 15.5/bbl having had briefly topped USD 16/bbl in early trade ahead of yesterday’s high of USD 16.18/bbl. Brent futures meanwhile meander just above 22/bbl after printing a current intraday high at USD 23.22/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> remains relatively steady north of USD 1700/oz thus far and briefly topped 1725/oz. Meanwhile, <strong>copper </strong>trades on a firmer footing after Anglo American’s copper production showed a YY decline, meanwhile, Antofagasta also stated it expects copper output this year towards the lower end of its guidance.</p><p><strong>Iran's Guards Chief says that Tehran will give a crushing response to any US threat within the Gulf; US warships will be destroyed if they threaten Iranian ships, according to TV remarks.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>US is reportedly probing whether traders profited from tips on Russia at OPEC+.

A meeting which could see disagreement over the rollout of the European Recovery Fund – officials touting a launched in 2021; however, Italy stated they cannot wait until June 2020 for approval. European bourses trade mixed with no standout under/outperformers, whilst broader sectors also paint a mixed picture and fail to reflect a clear risk tone – albeit the energy sector outperforms as the complex continues to post gains. The breakdown also sees a similarly mixed picture – again with Oil &amp; Gas leading the gains. A slew of earnings were reported in the pre-market, including prelim figures for Daimler (+0.9%) and Software AG (+0.8%), whilst Renault (+2.3%), Orange (+0.5%), Pernod Ricard (+0.3%), Accor (+1.1%), Swedbank (-0.7%), Volvo (-7.0%) all reported quarterly numbers – with Renault firmer despite a downbeat earnings release on reports Renault CEO is to unveil cost-cutting measures next month, whilst Volvo is pressured after substantially missing on its EPS and adj. operating profit expectations. Moving to Credit Suisse’s (-2.2%) earnings, the group topped net income forecasts but reported a deterioration in revenue and a Q1 loan loss provision over double its expectations. That being said, market volatility saw its FICC and Equity trading and sales both higher in excess of 20% YY. Elsewhere, Wirecard (+8.0%) sees itself at the top of the DAX after an independent audit of the Co. has uncovered no substantial findings with regards to questionable accounting methods; however, the full report is yet to be published. Results from the audit are now expected for April 27th and the Co’s FY results are to be published on April 30th. Finally, Tullow Oil (+30%) opened with gains above 60% and holds its place at the top of the Stoxx 600 after divesting its stake in Uganda to reduce net debt, whilst also seeing tailwinds from favourable price action in oil.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>EUR - The single currency is languishing at the bottom of the G10 table and looking precarious under 1.0800 vs the Dollar not to mention across the board as Eur/crosses teeter over psychological or key technical levels, like Eur/Chf on the verge of 1.0500, Eur/Jpy edging towards 116.00 and even Eur/Gbp testing the 200 DMA (0.8736). Much worse than anticipated preliminary Eurozone PMIs, and particularly poor services sector prints have undermined the Euro, but Eur/Usd is holding in just above or around chart supports ahead of 1.0750 in the form of April 6’s so called reaction low at 1.0769 and a 1.0757 Fib retracement level, for now, with some additional buffers provided by option expiries extending from 1.0800-1.0790 to 1.0750 in 3.1 bn and 1.2 bn respectively.</p><p>NZD/AUD/JPY/GBP - The Kiwi and Aussie continue to see-saw vs their US counterpart, with the former recovering from a stop-induced slide overnight after 0.5900 held and subsequently retesting resistance ahead of 0.6000, while the latter was able to withstand weak PMIs with the aid of trade data revealing a much wider surplus as exports outpaced imports nearly 3-fold. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6300+ status and briefly extended gains to circa 0.6370 before fading alongside Aud/Nzd ahead of 1.0650. Meanwhile, the Yen continues to retain an underlying safe-haven bid between 108.00 and 107.50 with decent option expiry interest also keeping the pair contained (1 bn at 107.50 and 1.6 bn from 107.85 to 108.00). Elsewhere, Sterling has (somehow) taken bleak UK PMI and CBI surveys in stride and resisting Greenback advances after Cable came close to filling bids touted at 1.2300, though this could be due to the aforementioned Eur/Gbp correction from recent 0.8800+ peaks rather than anything especially or uniquely Pound positive.</p><p>USD - The Buck may be primed for a fall after the latest US initial claims release and/or Markit PMIs, but for now the DXY is establishing a more assured base on the 100.000 handle and building momentum through 100.500, albeit with indirect traction from the Euro underperformance noted above and more pronounced Franc depreciation below 0.9700 through 0.9750.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - The Scandi Crowns are back on the front foot as crude prices continue to stabilise and sharp falls in Swedish sentiment indicators are acknowledged, but partially taken in context when compared to the starker deterioration elsewhere in Europe. However, in contrast to crude-related recoveries for EM currencies like the Rouble, COVID-19 contagion has intensified in SA where the Rand is back under 19.0000 vs the Dollar in the run up to President Ramaphosa setting out plans to re-open the economy after rolling out fiscal stimulus representing around 10% of the country’s GDP..</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A hectic first half for core bonds as initial/early losses were pared and partially reversed in wake of dire PMIs that has stalled a broader and partly oil-fuelled revival in risk sentiment. However, <strong>UK</strong> <strong>debt</strong> stands alone above parity between 136.98-135.93 Liffe parameters, while <strong>Bunds</strong> have topped out within their 172.20-171.29 Eurex range amidst ongoing outperformance at the Eurozone margins post-ECB fallen angel collateral assistance and pre-EU videoconference to try and launch a fiscal recovery fund. Elsewhere, <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have been largely side-lined, but impending data (namely weekly jobless claims) and preliminary Markit PMIs are likely to arouse more price action ahead of supply vibes from next week’s auction schedule and possibly results of the 5 year TIPS sale..</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures trade on a firmer footing as geopolitical risks continue to be priced in following US President Trump’s tweet regarding his order to the US Navy to shoot down all Iranian gunboats that harass US vessels. Aside from that, the underlying fundamentals remain broadly unchanged. The supply glut remains, and storage space remains scarce. “Given the glut we have in the oil market, it is difficult to see this offering lasting support to the market, unless the situation does escalate further” – ING says. Elsewhere and in fitting with recent source reports, Saudi Aramco has started to implement the OPEC+ pact ahead of its inauguration on May 1st. Aramco will be lower output to 8.5mln BPD, the output level mentioned under the terms of the of the deal – markets are yet to see if other producers follow suit, with Kuwait the only other country to publicly announce their early cuts thus far. <strong>WTI</strong> resides around USD 15.5/bbl having had briefly topped USD 16/bbl in early trade ahead of yesterday’s high of USD 16.18/bbl. <strong>Brent</strong> futures meanwhile meander just above 22/bbl after printing a current intraday high at USD 23.22/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains relatively steady north of USD 1700/oz thus far and briefly topped 1725/oz. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> trades on a firmer footing after Anglo American’s copper production showed a YY decline, meanwhile, Antofagasta also stated it expects copper output this year towards the lower end of its guidance.</p>",

Much worse than anticipated preliminary Eurozone PMIs, and particularly poor services sector prints have undermined the Euro, but Eur/Usd is holding in just above or around chart supports ahead of 1.0750 in the form of April 6’s so called reaction low at 1.0769 and a 1.0757 Fib retracement level, for now, with some additional buffers provided by option expiries extending from 1.0800-1.0790 to 1.0750 in 3.1 bn and 1.2 bn respectively.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/JPY/GBP</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie continue to see-saw vs their US counterpart, with the former recovering from a stop-induced slide overnight after 0.5900 held and subsequently retesting resistance ahead of 0.6000, while the latter was able to withstand weak PMIs with the aid of trade data revealing a much wider surplus as exports outpaced imports nearly 3-fold. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6300+ status and briefly extended gains to circa 0.6370 before fading alongside Aud/Nzd ahead of 1.0650. Meanwhile, the Yen continues to retain an underlying safe-haven bid between 108.00 and 107.50 with decent option expiry interest also keeping the pair contained (1 bn at 107.50 and 1.6 bn from 107.85 to 108.00). Elsewhere, Sterling has (somehow) taken bleak UK PMI and CBI surveys in stride and resisting Greenback advances after Cable came close to filling bids touted at 1.2300, though this could be due to the aforementioned Eur/Gbp correction from recent 0.8800+ peaks rather than anything especially or uniquely Pound positive.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck may be primed for a fall after the latest US initial claims release and/or Markit PMIs, but for now the <strong>DXY</strong> is establishing a more assured base on the 100.000 handle and building momentum through 100.500, albeit with indirect traction from the Euro underperformance noted above and more pronounced Franc depreciation below 0.9700 through 0.9750.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are back on the front foot as crude prices continue to stabilise and sharp falls in Swedish sentiment indicators are acknowledged, but partially taken in context when compared to the starker deterioration elsewhere in Europe. However, in contrast to crude-related recoveries for EM currencies like the Rouble, COVID-19 contagion has intensified in SA where the Rand is back under 19.0000 vs the Dollar in the run up to President Ramaphosa setting out plans to re-open the economy after rolling out fiscal stimulus representing around 10% of the country’s GDP.</p>",

        "subject": "PRIMER: EU Summit on Thursday; Lack of detailed proposals could see another impasse or delay in negotiations",
        "content": "<p><strong>*OVERVIEW</strong>: The EU27 are poised to sign off on the plans concocted by EZ finance ministers, and brainstorm on a long-term recovery plan. Leaders have signalled a general will for a larger coordinated fiscal response, albeit views seem to differ. Officials noted that the North fears that their financial positions will be contaminated by debt mutualisation in the future due to decisions taken by the South. The European Council is expected to discuss the size of a European Recovery Fund alongside other financing tools. The virtual meeting will be chaired by EU Council President Michel at 1400BST, although the lack of detailed proposals could see another impasse or delay in talks.</p><p><strong>*EU RECOVERY FUND</strong>: The Council President said the Fund should be established as soon as possible to kick-start economy once lockdown measures are eased, but officials note of a large divide between member states on the size and whether it should consist of only grants or solely loans. Consensus on a Recovery Fund this week has been heavily downplayed, with officials pointing to more clarity in June or July. In terms of the nuances, Spain is to propose a EUR 1.5tln recovery fund backed by perpetual bonds to finance the recovery of the worst-hit countries in grants and not loans, to avoid rising debt. France has backed the principals in Spain’s proposal but noted a physical meeting will be needed for a formal decision, potentially before Summer – President Macron previously said there is no choice but to set up a joint EUR 400bln recovery fund. Sources said the European Commission is reportedly seeking EUR 320bln in the market to finance the regional recovery, whilst later reports noted that the Commission is floating a EUR 2.2tln plan for economic recovery.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*EUROGROUP FALLOUT</strong>: At the Eurogroup meeting, Finance Ministers agreed on a EUR 540bln rescue package which consists of:</p><ul><li><strong>ESM CREDIT LINE (up to 2% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> This will be immediately available for member states with “light” conditionality. The size could be up to USD 240bln should all countries tap the maximum available. This also opens the door to Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) by the ECB, which allows the Central Bank to purchase unlimited debt from the worst-hit regions, albeit some analysts have suggested that the OMT programme has already been made redundant by the ECB's new PEPP.</li><li><strong>FIRMING EIB ACTIVITIES (up to 1.6% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> The European Investment Bank could support EUR 200bln of company financings, with emphasis on SMEs.</li><li><strong>SHORT-TIME WORK SCHEME (0.8% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> The EUR 100bln scheme was drafted to aid protect jobs and workers hit by the pandemic in the form of loans on “favourable” terms.</li></ul><p><strong>*CORONABOND</strong>: The common debt issuances pursued namely by Spain and Italy was not included in the Eurogroup’s draft document after experiencing pushback by several larger members, vehemently from Austria, Germany and Netherlands. However, Italy seems to be erring towards a compromise on the issue. Italian PM Conte, at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, signalled open-mindedness towards the ESM credit line and an alternative fund as a substitute to Eurobonds. Desks note that this should reduce tail risks for a roadblock.</p><p><strong>*ITALY’S DILEMMA: </strong>PM Conte set a high bar for success in negotiations for a post-virus response as domestic pressure builds at the epicentre of the European outbreak. Desks note that the PM will need a win to confine the rising Eurosceptics whilst fending off opposition parties waiting to muster support from any failures. Despite Conte’s more recent sanguine tone regarding a Coronabond compromise, participants believe the PM could be tempted to walk away from the table, having had battled for weeks on a Euro-wide debt instrument. Meanwhile, domestic pushback could arise from a compromise of just ESM lines – potentially paving a way for a change in government. It’s also worth noting that S&amp;P will be reviewing Italy’s sovereign debt on Friday; the agency will be eyeing the outcome of negotiations. Credit Suisse believes that the survival of the Euro could be at risk if EU leaders fail to understand the difficultly in Italy’s economical and political landscapes.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets mostly benefitted from the more constructive handover from Wall St where sentiment rebounded in tandem with oil prices</strong> amid touted bargain buying and increased US-Iran geopolitical risks after US President Trump instructed the US Navy to destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass US ships at sea, with the Senate’s recent passage of the USD 480bln relief bill also adding to the bout of optimism stateside. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.2%)</strong> advanced at the open but with gains later pared after mixed data releases, as well as weakness in defensives and the largest weighted financials sector. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.9%)</strong> traded higher although upside was restricted by an indecisive currency and following abysmal PMIs in which Manufacturing PMI posted its worst reading since 2009 and both Services and Composite PMIs were at record lows, while the <strong>KOSPI (+1.2%)</strong> outperformed after it eventually shrugged off the largest contraction for South Korea GDP in more than 11 years.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened amid the bounceback in risk appetite, lead by crude oil futures. After the 10-year yield fell below 0.55% on Tuesday, it today grinded back above 0.60%; at settlement, short end yields were relatively unchanged (2s around 0.21%), while long-end yields were up around 6bps (30s +6bps around 1.22%). The more constructive risk appetite coincided with raised dollar issuance, including several foreign issuers – such as the BoE (USD 2bln) and Mexico (USD 3bln) – which supported the swap spread compression seen on the session with a handful expected to swap. Meanwhile, other rates spreads compressed, too. The supportive risk tone saw credit default spread indices continue to move lower. At the same time, nearby Eurodollar contracts caught a bid as USD LIBOR posted further declines (the rest of the packs sold off in a steepener, similar to USTs), supporting a narrowing of FRA/LIBOR-OIS spreads; USD 3-month LIBOR-OIS sits around 90bps, down from its March peak of just beneath 140bps. T-notes (M0) settled 11 ticks lower at 139-01+.</p><p><strong>US President Trump says he signed executive order suspending immigration to the US</strong>, while he later stated he may extend or change the executive order on immigration even during the 60-day period it is in force.

Furthermore, McConnell stated we are not interested in revenue replacement for state governments or solving their pension problems and that state aid should be limited to virus issues.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets initially benefitted from the more constructive handover from Wall St where sentiment rebounded in tandem with oil prices amid touted bargain buying and increased US-Iran geopolitical risks after US President Trump instructed the US Navy to destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass US ships at sea, with the Senate’s recent passage of the USD 480bln relief bill also adding to the bout of optimism stateside. ASX 200 (-0.3%) advanced at the open but with the gains later pared after mixed data releases, as well as weakness in defensives and the largest weighted financials sector. Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) is higher but with upside restricted by an indecisive currency and following abysmal PMIs in which Manufacturing PMI posted its worst reading since 2009 and both Services and Composite PMIs were at record lows, while the largest contraction for South Korea GDP in more than 11 years also provided a limiter for the KOSPI (+0.5%). Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) remain afloat but with price action rangebound amid a lack of fresh drivers and continued PBoC liquidity inaction, while Hong Kong policymakers remained focused on defending the currency peg.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat overnight near the prior day’s highs above the 100.00 level heading into today’s economic relief bill vote at the House and the latest Initial Jobless Claims data which is expected to show another 4.2mln applied for unemployment benefits. EUR/USD is subdued and is stuck near the prior day’s lows after the ECB agreed to accept certain ‘junk’ bonds as collateral to mitigate impact of potential rating downgrades and with the currency also contained amid a heavy slate of option expiries totalling over EUR 5bln between 1.0800-1.0845 rolling off at today’s New York cut, while GBP/USD consolidates above 1.2300 amid ongoing lockdown uncertainty with the UK Chief Medical Advisor suggesting the chances of a near-term vaccine are incredibly small and that it would be necessary to continue with disruptive social distancing measures. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is flat below 108.00 and antipodeans are lacklustre with AUD/USD choppy around the 0.6300 level amid mixed data including weak PMIs and a jump in preliminary trade figures helped by a surge of exports in the resources sector.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs weakened amid the initial optimism but then recovered from lows as the regional stock indices retraced some of the gains, while focus turns to the upcoming 2yr JGB auction results.</p>",
