Sky News has been told that the offer to switch away from a fully formed withdrawal agreement - and instead put the focus on a more limited free trade agreement (FTA) - was part of the pitch made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar during talks on Thursday. While an FTA will not resolve all of the issues that have dogged the existing UK proposals, insiders have said it is a \"cleaner and more straightforward\" approach that could form the foundation for a more wide-ranging deal. (Sky News)</p><p>Irish PM Varadkar said it is now possible to come to an agreement before the end of October, according to an Irish Examiner Correspondent. (Newswires) Irish PM Varadkar suggested a deal will take longer than the 6 days left before the EUCO meeting, and it might only be “by the end of October”, which leaves it no time to pass it through parliament, according to The Sun. (Sun) The Irish PM noted that he had good discussions about a future relationship after Brexit and issues around consent and customs still remain. Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said yesterday was an injection of some much-needed optimism, but added \"mark my words, we are not there yet\".

The trade updates led to a positive risk appetite which saw underperformance in defensive sectors, with utilities the main underperformer being dragged lower by Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG) who are lower by over 30% as a judge removed PCG’s control over its restructuring as the plan from Elliott Management and other bondholders could be considered. Delta Airlines (DAL) which beat on EPS and slightly missed revenue expectations; however, it guided its Q4 EPS between USD 1.20-1.50 (exp. 1.50), CASM fell by 2.1%, forecasting: Q4 TRASM up 0-3%, CASM up 4%, system capacity up about 4.5%. Goldman Sachs downgraded some large tech names, HP Inc. (HPQ), Cisco (CSCO) and NetApp (NTAP), all traded in the red on Thursday. T-Mobile (TMUS) reached an agreement with Mississippi AG for the pending merger of Sprint (S), who both traded higher on the day, with a boost as FBN’s Gasparino reported other lawyers will join Mississippi and drop the suit to block the merger.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) surged as Target’s (TGT) marketing executive Mark Triton announced his move to become CEO at BBBY.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 18+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-22+:</strong> The debt complex sold off again on Thursday as reports suggested that both the US and Chinese delegation were working towards making progress in the trade talks and as Trump announced he will be meeting Lie He tomorrow, dismissing overnight reports, which saw flows into risk assets. The US sold USD 16bln of 30-year bonds at a record low yield of 2.17%, tailing by 0.1bps. The auction was covered at 2.25x, slightly above the six-auction average, with primary dealers taking less than their average share, too. The auction had little sway over the chunky sell-off, however, and by settlement yields were higher across the Treasury curve by around 7bps.</p>",

The article mentioned how China refused to talk about forced technology transfers and that the deputy level talks between the US and China aimed to lay the groundwork for high level negotiations, but failed to yield any progress on critical issues and the Chinese reportedly made no progress in persuading US negotiators to consider a freeze on tariff increases - one of Beijing’s main priorities. The article immediately saw a heavy risk off move.&nbsp; However, CNBC’s Kayla Tausche later announced that her sources stated China talks will still go ahead through to Friday, later rebuffed by Fox’s Lawrence whose reports were in-fitting with SCMP’s, adding the US will not suspend or roll back tariffs. However, during market hours US President Trump put the question to ease and announced he would be meeting with Lie He on Friday, indicating they are not to be leaving early.&nbsp; Sources overnight revealed some of the details in talks, where the US is reportedly weighing a currency pact with China as part of a partial deal (something that had previously been suggested) which could also see next week’s Oct. 15th tariffs suspended. NYT later reported the US will soon issue licenses allowing some US companies to supply non-sensitive goods to Chinese Cos such as the telecoms giant, Huawei; MOFCOM later urged the US to stop the unreasonable pressure on the company. FT sources added the US is weighing options that would increase inspections on parcels from China in an attempt to crackdown on shipments of contraband. On Agricultural purchases, China is reportedly buying record levels of pork as trade talks continue. Commerce Secretary Ross spoke, saying how China trade practices have gotten worse and that the US prefers not to impose tariffs, but it keeps China attentive. Lie He reiterated that China is willing to reach an agreement on matters important to both sides, and that they are willing to cooperate on trade balance, market access and investor protection to prevent any further friction.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>Showed that QE was opposed by a number of members who said it should be an instrument of last resort - adding it is not an efficient instrument in the low yield environment. Some were prepared to support a 20bp cut if QE was excluded. QE had a 'clear majority', tiering a 'majority', 10bp cut a 'very large majority', but all agreed on the need for further easing - some questions around the growth forecast, concerns they were too optimistic. Danske Bank expressed concern that some believed the growth forecasts were too optimistic as the projections already incorporates easier financial conditions. Prior to the minutes’ release the FT reported that the technocratic MPC within the ECB had advised against the implementation of QE, but ultimately ECB President Mario Draghi ignored the recommendation – the minutes did not note said interaction, however. Danske’s key takeaway is that the minutes do not indicate an ECB about to act imminently and they expect the Board to stay side-lined at the approaching October meeting with an increasingly likelihood of action for the December meeting.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The meeting between<strong> </strong>UK PM Johnson and Irish PM Varadkhar, which had been touted as the last chance to save UK/EU Brexit negotiations, apparently delivered; No.10 released a statement saying that there is a pathway to a possible deal, that the two sides will continue to engage in discussions and reiterated that a deal is in everyone's interest. Moreover, the statement revealed that UK Brexit Secretary Barclay will meet EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier tomorrow, after which Barnier will make the call as to whether or not negotiations can now intensify. Irish PM Varadkar was upbeat on the talks, and reaffirmed the statement in later comments, saying a deal by the month end is still possible. Possibly explaining how talks today made such progress; there were unconfirmed reports of a “significant concession” on the British side on the customs issue, although details are still hazy and No. 10 has not commented on the speculation; although a PoliticsHome reported a UK government official said “everyone is trying to fill a void because neither side are talking”, when asked about the concession. Also, Irish PM Varadkar him self said issues still remain on the customs issue. On UK arithmetic, as noted by the BBC’s Political Editor Kuenssberg, even if a deal with the EU can be struck on the back of such concessions on, they may risk UK PM Johnson losing the votes of the DUP and Brexiteer wing of his party in parliament – meaning ultimately any deal agreed with the EU may not be able to pass. In the tail end of session, Sky reported that Brexit negotiators are proposing a “pared-down” Free Trade Agreement to end the Brexit impasse and to get a deal done by the end of October, according to a well informed source; adding While an FTA will not resolve all of the issues that have dogged the existing UK proposals, insiders have said it is a \"cleaner and more straightforward\" approach that could form the foundation for a more wide-ranging deal.</p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>was flat in September on a M/M basis, missing the expected and previous pace of +0.1% - leaving the Y/Y figure at +1.7% (exp. +1.8%, prev. +1.7%). The core M/M figure printed +0.1%, missing the expected +0.2% and a fall from the prior +0.3%, although the Y/Y remained at a pace of +2.4%, in line with expectations. ING sees the misses providing leeway for the Fed, the fall in the core M/M comes after three consecutive +0.3% readings, which had raised concerns of upward inflation pressures, casting a shadow over the Fed’s move to a more accommodative policy stance. Under the hood, the bank highlights the drags: energy due to falling gasoline prices; used car prices had a chunky decline; apparel had its first decline since April; medical care costs also declined.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed’s Kashkari (Dove, Non-Voter) said that rates are roughly around the neutral mark now. Fed's Kaplan (Non-Voter) said he will take some time to carefully monitor developments following the two red cuts and has an open mind to further easing, mainly reiterating previous comments and the Fed party line. Kaplan did express his support for the balance sheet adjustment to ensure ample supply of reserves and for more permanent steps to ensure short-term funding markets worked properly.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 18+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-22+: </strong>The debt complex sold off again on Thursday as reports suggested that both the US and Chinese delegation were working towards making progress in the trade talks and as Trump announced he will be meeting Lie He tomorrow, dismissing overnight reports, which saw flows into risk assets. The US sold USD 16bln of 30-year bonds at a record low yield of 2.17%, tailing by 0.1bps. The auction was covered at 2.25x, slightly above the six-auction average, with primary dealers taking less than their average share, too. The auction had little sway over the chunky sell-off, however, and by settlement yields were higher across the Treasury curve by around 7bps.</p><p><strong>* OPEC’S MONTHLY OIL REPORT:</strong> OPEC lowered their oil demand growth forecast for 2019 by slightly less than EIA in its STEO, released on Tuesday, cutting it by 0.04mln BPD to EIA’s 0.05mln BPD cut. OPEC’s forecast for 2019 oil demand growth remains higher than EIA’s, at 0.98mln BPD vs. 0.84mln BPD. Moreover, while OPEC held their forecast for 2020 global oil demand growth at 1.08mln BPD, the same as last month, EIA reduced their forecast 0.1mln BPD and now see 2020 global oil demand grow by 1.3mln BPD. OPEC said the 2019 demand growth forecast was revised down in-spite of an upwardly revised 3Q19, amid strong demand growth in Saudi Arabia, counterbalanced by a downward revision to oil demand data in 1H19 due to slower-than-expected oil requirements in OECD America, Asia Pacific and Other Asia. OPEC crude production in September decreased by 1.318mln BPD to an average 28.49mln BPD, according to secondary sources. Output decreased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iraq and in Iran, while it increased mainly in Libya, Angola and Congo. Demand for OPEC crude for 2019 was revised up by 100k BPD from the previous report to stand at 30.7mln BPD, 0.9mln BPD lower than the 2018 level. 2020 OPEC demand revised up by 200k BPD to 29.6mln BPD. The report cut its non-OPEC supply growth forecasts for both 2019 and 2020 and also said that the Q3 oil supply deficit was the widest in years.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.96 HIGHER AT USD 53.55/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.78 HIGHER AT USD 59.10/BBL: </strong>Oil prices danced again to the gyrations of the S&amp;P, which have been puppeteered by the give and take nature of US-China trade headlines – prices ultimately settled firmer as sentiment grew warmer to some sort of agreement forming in Washington. Supply updates had little sway on benchmarks but OPEC Secretary General Barkindo did say that all options were on the table when asked about deeper production cuts at the December OPEC+ meeting. On a similar vein, the Russian Direct Investment Fund Chief said Russian President Putin and Saudi Officials are to discuss an OPEC+ deal to cut oil output further. Meanwhile, as the unrest in Ecuador continues, the Energy Minister announced the production has been curbed by 520k BPD, more acute than the 232k BPD quoted on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>* SYRIA/TURKEY: </strong>US President Trump announced Wednesday night he would do far more than sanctions on Turkey if it does not act humanely – just as operation “peace spring” got underway. The framework for these sanctions includes targeting Turkish President Erdogan’s assets, imposing visa restrictions and defining the purchase of Russian S-400 Missile Systems as significant and subject to sanctions. US President Trump reiterated his hard stance on Turkey, tweeting “I say hit Turkey very hard financially and with sanctions if they do not play by the rules,” adding he is watching closely. The Turkish Defence Ministry said there were also reports of further civilian injury, however this time in Turkey, as mortars were fired from Syria.</p><p><strong>* EU DATA: </strong>UK GDP fell this month by 0.1%, expectations were for 0%. However, Y/Y GDP beat expectations by 0.2% taking it to 1.1% and the prior was revised to 1.3% from 1.0%. UK manufacturing declined 0.7% in August, falling from a 0.3% gain last month (which was revised higher to 0.4%). The UK trade deficit deepened but less so than expected. BoE Carney stated UK data is fairly volatile at the moment, and that today’s data is consistent with a picture of soft underlying growth. German trade surplus narrowed from 20.5bln to 18.1bln, greater than the expected 19.1bln. The narrower surplus was driven by both an increase in imports and reduced exports. Swedish CPI was firmer than expected, rising 1.3% Y/Y, the same pace as prior. Norwegian CPI also slightly firmer than expected.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.6% at 2938, NASDAQ-100 0.7% at 7740, Dow Jones 0.6% at 26497,</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.5%, Consumer Staples 0.2%, Energy 1.3%, Financials 1%, Health Care 0.5%, Industrials 0.9%, Information Technology 0.6%, Materials 1%, Telecommunication Services 0.6%, Utilities -0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Financials outperformed as the Fed is to finalise its updated framework for regional banks, which would reportedly free between USD 100-250bln from latest capital and liquidity requirements, also benefitting from higher yields as US debt falls on positive china trade updates. The trade updates led to a positive risk appetite which saw underperformance in defensive sectors, with utilities the main underperformer being dragged lower by Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG) who are lower by over 30% as a judge removed PCG’s control over its restructuring as the plan from Elliott Management and other bondholders could be considered. Delta Airlines (DAL) which beat on EPS and slightly missed revenue expectations; however, it guided its Q4 EPS between USD 1.20-1.50 (exp. 1.50), CASM fell by 2.1%, forecasting: Q4 TRASM up 0-3%, CASM up 4%, system capacity up about 4.5%. Goldman Sachs downgraded some large tech names, HP Inc. (HPQ), Cisco (CSCO) and NetApp (NTAP), all traded in the red on Thursday. T-Mobile (TMUS) reached an agreement with Mississippi AG for the pending merger of Sprint (S), who both traded higher on the day, with a boost as FBN’s Gasparino reported other lawyers will join Mississippi and drop the suit to block the merger. After the European close, Hugo Boss (BOSS GY) reported earnings after market where preliminary Q3 results were as followed: EBIT came in at EUR 80mln (Exp. EUR 102mln), revenue EUR 720mln (Exp. EUR 730mln); cut its FY19 EBIT to EUR 330-340mln from EUR 347mln. The cut in guidance added a headwind to US luxury names such as, Tapestry (TPR) and Ralph Loren (RL). Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) surged as Target’s (TGT) marketing executive Mark Triton announced his move to become CEO at BBBY.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: DXY</strong> traded lower throughout the morning as it fell beneath the 99 handle over-night, some of the losses were initially pared despite a weaker US CPI, however DXY changed direction again heading to lows of 98.61, from initial highs of 99.07. On account of the broad dollar weakness, <strong>EUR</strong>, the <strong>Antipodes</strong> and <strong>CAD</strong> were all firmer, with the latter (and other petro-currencies) supported by firmer crude prices. <strong>Havens,</strong> however, were unable to benefit from the weaker buck; the news that US President Trump would be meeting with Vice Premier Lui He tomorrow (and as such the Chinese delegation would not be leaving negotiations one day early) triggered a bout of risk, pressuring CHF, JPY and XAU. Early in the EU session, <strong>SEK</strong> was bid after firmer than expected CPI, while, contrastingly, largely in line CPI gave <strong>NOK </strong>little impetus, although was slightly firmer against EUR. <strong>GBP </strong>again traded as a function of Brexit sentiment; talks between UK PM Johnson and Irish PM Varadkar were reportedly constructive, news of which saw sterling break above the 1.2300 handle from the low 1.22s and extending above 1.24 later on, with the outcome of the meeting seemingly exceeding expectations. <strong>EMFX</strong> is mostly stronger on account of the weaker buck; <strong>BRL</strong> bucked the trend, weighed by weaker than expected retail sales data. <strong>ZAR</strong> was supported by firm manufacturing production data. <strong>TRY</strong> was firmer, despite the country's ongoing offensive into Syria and more threats of economic ruin via sanctions form US President Trump.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>OPEC’S MONTHLY OIL REPORT:</strong> OPEC lowered their oil demand growth forecast for 2019 by slightly less than EIA in its STEO, released on Tuesday, cutting it by 0.04mln BPD to EIA’s 0.05mln BPD cut. OPEC’s forecast for 2019 oil demand growth remains higher than EIA’s, at 0.98mln BPD vs. 0.84mln BPD. Moreover, while OPEC held their forecast for 2020 global oil demand growth at 1.08mln BPD, the same as last month, EIA reduced their forecast 0.1mln BPD and now see 2020 global oil demand grow by 1.3mln BPD. OPEC said the 2019 demand growth forecast was revised down in-spite of an upwardly revised 3Q19, amid strong demand growth in Saudi Arabia, counterbalanced by a downward revision to oil demand data in 1H19 due to slower-than-expected oil requirements in OECD America, Asia Pacific and Other Asia. OPEC crude production in September decreased by 1.318mln BPD to an average 28.49mln BPD, according to secondary sources. Output decreased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iraq and in Iran, while it increased mainly in Libya, Angola and Congo. Demand for OPEC crude for 2019 was revised up by 100k BPD from the previous report to stand at 30.7mln BPD, 0.9mln BPD lower than the 2018 level. 2020 OPEC demand revised up by 200k BPD to 29.6mln BPD. The report cut its non-OPEC supply growth forecasts for both 2019 and 2020 and also said that the Q3 oil supply deficit was the widest in years.</li><li>Oil prices danced again to the gyrations of the S&amp;P, which have been puppeteered by the give and take nature of US-China trade headlines – prices ultimately settled firmer as sentiment grew warmer to some sort of agreement forming in Washington. Supply updates had little sway on benchmarks but OPEC Secretary General Barkindo did say that all options were on the table when asked about deeper production cuts at the December OPEC+ meeting. On a similar vein, the Russian Direct Investment Fund Chief said Russian President Putin and Saudi Officials are to discuss an OPEC+ deal to cut oil output further. Meanwhile, as the unrest in Ecuador continues, the Energy Minister announced the production has been curbed by 520k BPD, more acute than the 232k BPD quoted on Wednesday.</li></ul>",

Excluding SOMA holdings, there will be around USD 26bln of cash flows this week (around USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupons).</p><p><strong>30-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts, who hold a negative bias going into the auction, say the 30-year sector is trading rich in asset swap versus older 30s; the bank argues that demand has been falling in the long-end noting that seven of the last 10 auctions have tailed, while cover ratios averages have also been edging lower. SocGen says this indicates that investors have been staying away from long-end auctions. Additionally, 30s yields are currently trading near all-time lows seen in August, which may also turn-off buyers.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>Tail: (Prev. -1.6bps, 6-auction avg. -1bps)</li><li>High Yield: (Prev. 2.27%, 6-auction avg. 2.613%)</li><li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.22x, 6-auction avg. 2.23x)</li><li>Dealers: (Prev. 26.4%, 6-auction avg. 27.3%)</li><li>Directs: (Prev. 13.3%, 6-auction avg. 18.8%)</li><li>Indirects: (Prev. 60.3%, 6-auction avg. 67.2%)</li></ul>",

However, perhaps the most upbeat statements came via the US Chamber of Commerce, as an official said a currency pact may evolve in an exchange for a further tariff delay, adding hopes for an ‘early harvest’ that would forestall the pending levies scheduled for October and December 15. The Dollar remains on the back foot overall having shrugged off mixed US data in the form of CPI and weekly initial claims, with the <strong>DXY </strong>unable to reclaim 99.000 status as only the safe-haven Yen and Gold lost out vs the Greenback.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A relatively late burst propelled the Pound towards the top of the G10 table, and the catalyst was Brexit-related with the UK and Irish PMs concluding that there is still a route towards reaching a deal on the backstop.

A bout of selling at the European open coincided with some comments out of China MOFCOM (condemning the US for smearing China over treatment of Uighars and for putting pressure on Chinese companies incl. Huawei), although the move quickly pared and although now higher, Indices are still well within overnight ranges. The CAC 40 (+0.5%) is an outperformer, with better than expected earnings from LVMH (+4.1%) and Christian Dior (+3.5%) propping up the index and pulling other luxury names such as Kering (3.2%) higher. Conversely, the FTSE 100 (unch.) is lagging on sterling strength on account of the broadly weaker buck. Looking ahead, though trade developments will likely continue to be the crucial driver of sentiment today, traders will also be watching US CPI, a slate of Central Bank speak from Fed’s Kashkari, Daly, Mester and Bostic and ECB’s Lane for any more clues as to the next move from two of the world’s most important central banks. In terms of the sectors, the picture is mixed; Consumer Discretionary (+1.0%) is the outperformer on aforementioned outperformance in luxury names. The defensive Utilities (-0.5%), Health Care (-0.6%) and Consumer Staples (-0.7%) sectors are the underperformers, while Tech (-0.1%) and Industrials (-0.1%) are also lower. In terms of other individual movers, Lafargeholcim (+2.0%) opened higher after Co. reportedly decided not to bid for Bayer’s USD 3bln Mortar Business, news which saw the latter’s share price fall substantially. Phillips (-8.0%) sunk after earnings underwhelmed. BHP Billiton (+1.5%) shares were supported on the news that Standard Life Aberdeen (+0.9%) own a 4.9% stake in the Co. and are reportedly urging them to suspend membership of groups which engage in obstructive lobbying for the broad fuel industry.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Greenback is softer across the board following FOMC minutes that revealed a bit more polarisation beyond the official divergent dissentions, but a higher recession risk via statistical models that warranted and justified the second insurance cut. Moreover, the Fed remains ready to respond to further threats and headwinds with Chair Powell signalling balance sheet expansion in separate comments, albeit for reserve rather than monetary policy purposes. Ahead, the first weekly claims update post-NFP, while headline inflation data follows weak PPI, as the DXY slips back below 99.000 to test the water under the 21 DMA (98.780) within a 99.073-98.653 range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/EUR/CHF/GBP - </strong>The major beneficiaries of general US Dollar weakness and probably some anticipation or at least hope that out of the mass of conflicting reports on US-China trade talks some form of progress emerges towards a deal. The Kiwi is forming a base above 0.6300 ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI, the Aussie appears more buoyant around 0.6750 and the Euro has finally cleared stiff resistance to breach 1.1000 on the way through a Fib retracement at 1.1021, with 1.1050 next on the radar before another Fib at 1.1055. Elsewhere, the Franc is approaching 0.9900 again, but lagging behind the single currency with the cross elevated between 1.0940-00 parameters and a hefty 1.1 bn Eur/Chf option expiry at the base looks safe for now, if not over the NY cut. Meanwhile, Sterling remains prone to breaking Brexit headlines awaiting PM Johnson’s meeting with his Irish counterpart at midday, but also digested a data deluge that was soft overall albeit not as bad as some feared perhaps. Thus, Cable has survived another scrape with 1.2200 and stops on a break of 0.9000 in Eur/Gbp did not trigger too much further upside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY - </strong>The Loonie and Yen have been subject to US-China trade news congestion and knock-on swings in risk sentiment, but both gleaning traction from the aforementioned Buck underperformance, as Usd/Cad retreats to 1.3300 from 1.3345 and Usd/Jpy pares back between 107.75-04 bounds and decent expiry interest spanning 107.00, 107.35-50 and 107.70 (1.2 bn, 1.5 bn and 1.3 bn respectively).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK/CNH/TRY - </strong>Somewhat mixed fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Sek reverses sharply from new decade highs circa 10.9325 to almost 10.8300 on the back of firmer than forecast Swedish inflation data, but Eur/Nok meanders within 10.0880-10.0480 ‘extremes’ after inconclusive Norwegian CPI prints. Similarly, Usd/Cnh is on the soft side and not far from a 7.1000 low on the US-China trade hype in contrast to Usd/Try edging closer to 5.9000 as Turkey’s Syria mission continues amidst mounting international condemnation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Bunds and Gilts continue to collapse following the break below prior weekly lows, with new intraday bases just hit at 173.42 and 134.09 respectively, but contagion along the UST curve remains contained post-FOMC minutes and pre-CPI/initial claims, which could offer some interim impetus and distraction pending more updates on the state of US-China trade negotiations.

Note also, the last leg of this week’s US supply after indifferent 3 and 10 year auctions.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>The crude complex is slightly lower on Thursday morning, </strong>although price action for now largely mirrors that in the equity market, following similarly choppy moves on the mixed trade headlines overnight. In terms of supply updates; Ecuador’s Petroecuador declared a force majeure on exports yesterday after local unrest resulted in the closure of oil fields. The country exported roughly 0.315mln BPD of crude oil in September 2019; ING point out that nearly half of it went to the US West Coast and as such a lack of oil supplies from Ecuador could create some shortages at the West Coast in the short term. Additionally, Shell lifted a force majeure on Bonny Light exports from Nigeria (in place since 13 September), bringing around 0.150mln BPD back online. However, crude markets remain seemingly fixated on demand side factors for now, with the outcome of today’s principal level talks between the US and China likely the key determinant of near-term direction, although traders will also be eyeing OPEC’s Monthly Oil Report at 12.45 BST. In terms of levels; technicians will be eyeing support at USD 51.40/bbl (yesterday’s low) and USD 51.00/bbl (low of the 3rd) and resistance at USD 53.70/bbl (yesterday’s high) and USD 54.00/bbl (high of the 7th) for WTI Nov’ 19 futures. For Brent Nov’ 19 futures, recent highs at the USD 59.35/bbl and USD 59.70 levels may provide some resistance, while Wednesday’s USD 57.40/bbl low may provide some support. Over in the metals complex; price action in <strong>Gold </strong>has calmed down after the overnight action, with the precious metal currently range bound between the USD 1509/oz and USD 1515/oz levels, well of last night’s USD 1522/oz highs. ING note strong demand for the yellow metal; “Gold ETF investments increased by 0.2mOz yesterday, the seventeenth consecutive day of increases in gold ETF holdings”, the bank notes. Demand for safe-haven gold continues to be strong, they argue, due to the uncertainty over the US-China trade talks, increasing possibilities of another Fed rate cut and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East including the recent clashes between Turkey and Syria. Copper, which also saw choppy action overnight, is higher, after breaking above its USD 2.59/lb 50DMA.&nbsp;</p>",

Prior to all that, Brexit developments and ECB minutes will be eyed for more on the backstop saga and divisions about unleashing another round of APP that seems to have been opposed beyond the GC.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is softer across the board following FOMC minutes that revealed a bit more polarisation beyond the official divergent dissentions, but a higher recession risk via statistical models that warranted and justified the second insurance cut. Moreover, the Fed remains ready to respond to further threats and headwinds with Chair Powell signalling balance sheet expansion in separate comments, albeit for reserve rather than monetary policy purposes. Ahead, the first weekly claims update post-NFP, while headline inflation data follows weak PPI, as the <strong>DXY</strong> slips back below 99.000 to test the water under the 21 DMA (98.780) within a 99.073-98.653 range.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/EUR/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>The major beneficiaries of general US Dollar weakness and probably some anticipation or at least hope that out of the mass of conflicting reports on US-China trade talks some form of progress emerges towards a deal. The Kiwi is forming a base above 0.6300 ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI, the Aussie appears more buoyant around 0.6750 and the Euro has finally cleared stiff resistance to breach 1.1000 on the way through a Fib retracement at 1.1021, with 1.1050 next on the radar before another Fib at 1.1055. Elsewhere, the Franc is approaching 0.9900 again, but lagging behind the single currency with the cross elevated between 1.0940-00 parameters and a hefty 1.1 bn Eur/Chf option expiry at the base looks safe for now, if not over the NY cut. Meanwhile, Sterling remains prone to breaking Brexit headlines awaiting PM Johnson’s meeting with his Irish counterpart at midday, but also digested a data deluge that was soft overall albeit not as bad as some feared perhaps. Thus, Cable has survived another scrape with 1.2200 and stops on a break of 0.9000 in Eur/Gbp did not trigger too much further upside.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Yen have been subject to US-China trade news congestion and knock-on swings in risk sentiment, but both gleaning traction from the aforementioned Buck underperformance, as Usd/Cad retreats to 1.3300 from 1.3345 and Usd/Jpy pares back between 107.75-04 bounds and decent expiry interest spanning 107.00, 107.35-50 and 107.70 (1.2 bn, 1.5 bn and 1.3 bn respectively).</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK/CNH/TRY</strong></p><p>Somewhat mixed fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Sek reverses sharply from new decade highs circa 10.9325 to almost 10.8300 on the back of firmer than forecast Swedish inflation data, but Eur/Nok meanders within 10.0880-10.0480 ‘extremes’ after inconclusive Norwegian CPI prints. Similarly, Usd/Cnh is on the soft side and not far from a 7.1000 low on the US-China trade hype in contrast to Usd/Try edging closer to 5.9000 as Turkey’s Syria mission continues amidst mounting international condemnation.</p>",

Note, the Norges Bank forecasts 2.14% for the former, so roughly chiming with consensus, but for reference prior to the September policy meeting and updated financial stability assessment the Bank saw CPI-ATE at 2.37% for September. Nordea see a print of 2.2%, due to clothing rebounding after summer sales, but this marginally higher reading would not be sufficient to impact the Norges Bank’s rate path of on hold for the foreseeable future (Governor Olsen ascribed a 40% chance to a hike in the near-term). The data may well be seen as the last notable release prior the October 24th rate decision, as the unemployment metrics are scheduled for release a few hours before the rate decision itself.</li><li>Recent data from Norway has been poor, with the Manufacturing PMI printing below expectations and only just avoiding a drop into contraction; and manufacturing production turning negative and well below the prior -1.1% vs. Prev. 1.0%.</li><li>Recent rhetoric out of the Bank has been very light, with the only notable comments arising from Governor Olsen reaffirming the rate path unveiled in September for the depo to remain close to 1.5% for the next few years, while highlighting that Norway has more policy room for manoeuvring as the rate was increased again recently (25bp hike to 1.5% in September), and in the scenario of a severe downturn the Norges Bank would ease slightly.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Sweden’s</strong> CPIF YY is expected to ease to 1.2% vs. Prev. 1.3%; but Nordea calls for the YY metric to drop to 1.1%, and for reference the Riksbank’s forecast is 1.3%. Some desks are noting that if the data prints as expected then this may be enough to force the Bank to drop its hawkish bias. Inflation, alongside the upcoming employment metrics, are the final notable data prints ahead of the 24th October Riksbank meeting. PMI releases out of Sweden have been poor, with both services and manufacturing PMI dropping unexpectedly into contractionary territory: 49.8 and 46.3 respectively.</li><li>Much of the focus for Sweden recently has been Riksbank rhetoric. Since the September minutes, we have seen a plethora of commentary, with Jansson and Skingsley noting that the situation has deteriorated; which may impact the rate outlook ahead. On the flip side, Governor Ingves and Ohlsson’s rhetoric has been in-line with the Bank’s forecasts for a hike at the end of this year/beginning of 2020.</li><li>In terms of EUR/SEK the cross has reached fresh YTD highs of 10.9335 as the negative data and an increase in comments which imply a more dovish outlook ahead has led to the SEK depreciating. Looking ahead, 10.9452 (Fib) may prove to be a resistance marker for the cross.</li></ul>",

This saw <strong>USD/JPY</strong> decline from 107.45 to a low just shy of 107.00, whilst high-beta currencies saw downside with <strong>AUD/USD</strong> and <strong>NZD/USD</strong> falling to session lows of 0.6705 and 0.6275 respectively. Further, <strong>USD/CNH</strong> saw substantial upside and reached a high of 7.1680 whilst <strong>DXY</strong> remained near intraday highs of 99.07. However, later headlines which suggested that US is weighing a currency pact which could see the scheduled tariff increase suspended, coupled with source reports that the Trump administration will soon issue licensing allowing some US firms to deal with Huawei saw a bout of risk appetite. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> reversed the earlier move and reached a peak of 107.80 (with USD 1.3bln in option expiring at 107.70) whilst <strong>AUD/USD </strong>and <strong>NZD/USD</strong> rose to session highs (0.6755 and 0.6313 respectively). <strong>USD/CNH</strong> fell briefly fell below its 50 DMA (7.1061) and the 7.1000 mark to a low of 7.0950, and the DXY hit session lows (at the time) to test 99.00 to the downside. In another twist, FT reported that the Trump Administration is reportedly mulling increased inspection in parcels from China, which could add a new point of friction. Thus, some of the price action pared back with<strong> USD/JPY </strong>stabilising around 107.50, <strong>AUD/USD</strong> and <strong>NZD/USD</strong> moved back to around 0.6740 and 0.6300 respectively, whist <strong>USD/CNH</strong> moved back above its 50 DMA and <strong>DXY</strong> settled middle the range <strong>after little reaction to the FOMC minutes</strong>. As trade headlines died down, <strong>DXY</strong> continued to print session lows as participants digested the barrage of headlines and thus <strong>G10 FX (ex-JPY)</strong> hit session highs. <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> largely moved at the whim of the Buck.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong>Another trade-driven story, <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures found bases at 51.40/bbl and 57.80/bbl respectively as sentiment and demand outlook took a hit on the SCMP article, although prices recovered back above 52/bbl and 58/bbl following a volley of US-China headlines. The benchmarks remain lower on the day ahead of the OPEC Monthly Oil Report, with participants eyeing OPEC members’ production figures as the global oil demand forecast may prove somewhat stale as trade talks in Washington go underway. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> has given up a bulk of its earlier gains after it hit an intraday high of 1517/oz amid the SCMP-induced risk aversion. The yellow metal resides sub-1510/oz but above its 50 DMA (1506/oz) as all eyes turn to developments in Washington. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices were also swayed by the aforementioned headlines, but the red metal is poised to end the Asia session in the green after testing its 50 DMA (2.58/lb) to the upside.</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 13+ TICKS AT 131-09:</strong> The TPLEX drifted lower through the session as risk appetite improved in reaction to (somewhat) progressive developments out of the Chinese delegation, who showed interest in making some progress in talks. The September meeting FOMC minutes had a muted reaction on the Treasury curve with market pricing for future cuts little changed. By settlement yields were higher by 4.5bps across the entire curve. The 10-year Treasury auction held-up decent, stopping through the WI by 0.1bps and covered 2.43x, above the six-auction average of 2.38x, although indirects took a haircut off their average.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Finally, the FT report, which placed an additional obstacle in trade talks, saw US equity futures pause just under the levels seen at the beginning of the session. Back to Asia-Pac, ASX 200 (+0.1%) was cushioned by gold miners amid firmer prices in the yellow metal, whilst Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) swung between gains and losses in tandem with the JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.3%) opened flat but drifted into positive territory as the NYT reported (citing sources) that the Trump Admin is willing to let some US firms deal with Huawei, thus signalling that US is seemingly willing to make some concessions ahead of trade talks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX markets whipsawed amid a flurry of opposing trade reports, with the initial risk aversion emanating from the SCMP sources article which stated that trade talks will be cut a day short.
