In related news, US President Trump was reportedly so angered by China's latest tariff retaliation that he wanted to double the tariffs but resorted to a 5% hike after speaking with CEO's, according to three sources cited by CNBC.

The vote occurred after UK Parliament Speaker Bercow granted lawmakers an emergency debate, while reports later noted the Tory party are set to break convention and will stand against Speaker Bercow in the next general election. Furthermore, UK government sources confirmed 21 rebels will be kicked out of the party for voting against the government. (Newswires/Telegraph)</p><p>UK PM Johnson reiterated he believes he will get a deal with Brussels and that the UK will leave on October 31st without a deal if needed, while he added an election will be the only way to resolve this if lawmakers vote for Brexit delay. Of note, there were earlier reports that UK PM Johnson answered the government will uphold the constitution and obey the law when asked what he would do if bill passes that rules out a No-Deal Brexit. (Newswires)</p><p>UK Opposition Labour Leader Corbyn said the meeting with opposition leaders went very well and they are working to block a no-deal, while he is confident that we can have a general election and prevent a no-deal Brexit from occurring but later suggested they will not vote for a general election before extension to leaving the EU.

(Twitter)</p><p>ECB Policymakers are said to be leaning towards a rate cut and tiering, as well as reinforced guidance in September 12th stimulus package, according sources. Many also support QE but opposition from some northern states complicates the discussion and the ECB is said to have room for around 1yr of QE using flexibility under existing rules with no immediate need to change issuer limit. Furthermore, the new guidance will emphasize conditions needed for a rate lift-off and de-emphasize date component although the sources added that the discussion about ECB stimulus package is open, ongoing and no decision has been made, while it is also seen as vital for the ECB to leave some tools unused for incoming ECB President Lagarde. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Villeroy said it is clear monetary policy needs to maintain its full support and be ready to strengthen it, while he added that ECB has option of re-starting APP at any time but questioned if now is the right time and noted the priority today is to better anchor inflation expectations to our target which should be tackled by reinforced guidance. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB’s Muller reiterated there is no strong case to resume bond buying and that market expectations on stimulus have gone too far, while he is going into next week’s meeting with an open mind but thinks a rate cut should be the first option if action is needed.

(Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump criticized the Fed again in which he stated that Germany and other countries have negative rates and the Federal Reserve fails to act, while he also noted that Germany are the US's 'weak currency competitors'.

In stocks specific, Amazon (AMZN) outperformed today following a PT rise to USD 2600 from USD 2250 at RBC as they forecast shares to rise nearly 50% on the roll out of US one-day Prime delivery. Boeing (BA) was lower amid further delays to its 777 MAX planes as American Airlines (AAL) also announce a delay to their expected return of the jet, joining United Airlines (UAL) who do not see it ungrounding until December. Apple Insider reported Apple (AAPL) iPhone production is at similar levels of production to the prior year, AAPL traded lower by ~2% for most of the session. American Tower Corp (AMT) also traded higher after it was announced it is entering a new partnership with AT&amp;T (T).&nbsp; The energy sector tracked oil prices throughout the session which weighed on Concho Resources (CXO), who initially traded higher in the pre-market as it is to sell its Mexico Shelf assets for USD 925mln and is to initiate a USD 1.5bln share repurchase programme. Casino Names (WYNN, LVS, MLCO, MGM) were hit as August’s Macau Casino revenue missed expectations where it fell 8.6%, missing estimates for a 4% fall. Semiconductors were mixed, KLA Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) were higher after upgrades at Evercore, however other names Xilinx (XLNX), Micron (MU) &amp; Western Digital (WDC) were lower. Elsewhere in the semiconductor space, Samsung has started replacing Japanese materials with local suppliers for its production of semiconductors, a move which could offset Japan’s restrictions on high-tech exports to South Korea. CBS (CBS) &amp; Viacom (VIAB) were lower after brokerages cut both names’ PT on the deal between the two. S&amp;P 500 -0.7% AT 2906, NASDAQ-100 -1.1% AT 7610, DOW JONES -1.1% AT 26118.</p><p>The TPLEX bull steepened as a tumbling-into-contraction US ISM Manufacturing PMI raised the chances of Fed easing at its September meeting. The ISM figure surprised the market after falling into contraction (49.1), the first time since 2016, swiftly seeing Treasuries leg higher. However, prices since came off their highs, likely a function of the large slate of corporate issuance – 21 IG deals – but desks noted a large chunk of said issuance is expected to swap, providing a limit to the fade. At settlement the curve was generally steeper with the 2s30s widening by over 3bps, although the 5-year yield fell by just under 4.5bps which was slightly more than the 2-year yield’s decline. US T-note (U9) futures settled 13 ticks higher at 132-04.</p>",

It is hard to put a positive spin on the data. Pantheon Macroeconomics says the story is about the China slowdown and the trade war, with the latter now the biggest issue, judging from the widening gap between the ISM new orders component, and the China’s Caixin manufacturing PMI report, which has risen a couple of points from the January low. At the same time, Pantheon points out, export orders have dropped to the lowest since April 2009 (post Lehman crash), and the employment sub index has fallen to a three-year low at 47.4, from 51.7. “In short, we can find no good news here,” Pantheon writes, \"the survey is not yet consistent with a steep downturn in the broader economy – manufacturing already has been contracting for two quarters – but another couple of months of declines on this scale would leave the US facing an entirely unnecessary and self-inflicted recession.\"</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>China state news overnight reported that giving the US any trade concessions would be a \"grave error,\" and that Chinese officials are in no rush to secure a deal, casting into doubt President Trump's assertions that China wants to make a deal, and that trade talks are progressing. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China firmly opposes a trade war, hopes the two sides seek common ground while setting aside differences, and he hopes to appropriately resolve the issues on basis of equality and mutual respect. However, China state news Xinhua also suggested that Liu He's comments follow a meeting with a delegation led by US Senator Steve Daines, and Agricultural Secretary Perdue in China on Tuesday. Note, Daines, is also co-chair of the U.S. House of Senate US-China Working Group. Both US representatives said they are not willing to see economic and trade conflicts between the two sides.</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW:</strong> <strong>BoC Policy announcement due Wednesday 4th September at 1500BST/1000EDT. </strong>The Bank is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.75%. It is a statement-only meeting; no post-meeting press conference with Governor Poloz, and no updated economic projections. However, BoC Deputy Governor Schembri will deliver his Economic Progress Report on Thursday. While the Street does not expect any policy action in September, it will be keeping an eye out for clues on what the central bank will do in October.

The government is expected to lose given the 16 tory rebels fails to provide PM Johnson a majority, which means that UK lawmakers will take control of parliament on Wednesday and push through legislation to delay Brexit until January 2020; but before the lawmakers can legislate, however, PM Johnson has intimated he'd call general elections. If UK PM Johnson does win it would leave him scope for him to force Brexit, with or without a deal on the 31st October.<strong> </strong>Elsewhere, Brexit Secretary Barclay has called on the EU to be \"creative and flexible\" in finding solutions to the Irish border issue, though did not provide any details on a solution. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, UK construction PMI showed the sector's downturn is intensifying, BRC data showed UK retail sales flatlining in August, while Barclaycard data showed consumer spending rising by 1.3% in August (it grew by 4.5% in August 2018). <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/primer-tonight-s-brexit-vote-03-09-2019\">Click here for further analysis on tonight’s vote.</a></p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Sources reported that ECB policymakers are leaning towards a rate cut and tiering (both go hand in hand, the report implied), as well as reinforced forward guidance as part of a stimulus package at its 12th September meeting. Many are also supportive of QE, but opposition from some northern states is complicating discussions. The report said the central bank has room for around one year of QE, using flexibility under existing rules, and there would unlikely be any tweaks to its issuer limits. The new guidance will emphasise conditions needed for rate lift-off, and de-emphasise the calendar elements of forward guidance, the report said. Elsewhere, the article noted that discussions were open and ongoing, and no final decision had been made. Finally, the piece noted that there was no reason to stagger the stimulus package over several meetings, while there is a line of thought that the central bank also wants to leave some tools unused for incoming ECB President Lagarde, who is due to take the role from the outgoing Draghi in November. Elsewhere, <strong>ECB's Villeroy</strong> said that monetary policy needs to maintain its full support and be ready to strengthen it; ECB has option of re-starting APP at any time but questioned if now is the right time (which could be viewed as more “hawkish”). The Bank of France Governor added that APP will remain an essential instrument of monetary policy, the priority today is to better anchor inflation expectations to our target, which should be tackled by reinforced guidance.</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> The 5SM party members voted 79.3% in favour of the formation of a new government with the PD party, well exceeding previous poll estimates of 51% in favour. PM Conte will now see Italian President Mattarella on Wednesday morning to formally announce he is ready to form a new government.</p><p><strong>* SPAIN: </strong>Spain’s PSOE has made proposals aimed at winning the support of Podemos, in order to form a Socialist government. However, sources who are reportedly familiar with the thinking of acting PM Sanchez, and PSOE chief, said the Socialists now see a repeat election as the more likely outcome. Sanchez has recently stated that there were too many disagreements to form a government with the far left Podemos, but he did offer an option that would see parties agree on policies, and give non-cabinet positions to Podemos; Podemos’ chief Iglesias rejected this, stating a coalition government is the only option. If there is no deal on a government by the 23rd September, elections will be held on November 10th</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>French Foreign Minister said that discussions with Iran focused on setting up credit lines guaranteed by oil are ongoing, but in return Iran needs to comply fully to the Nuclear Deal; he caveated that the credit line plan depends on the US reissuing oil export waivers, something of a hurdle given that Washington and Tehran are not even talking currently. As the Iran-set deadline of September 5th for the EU to salvage the Nuclear Deal approaches, Iran reiterated that it is prepared to make a third deviation from its commitments if the deadline is not met. A French diplomatic source said an additional violation of the nuclear deal by Iran would send the \"wrong signal\", but the need to find a solution would remain.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLED USD 1.16 LOWER AT USD 53.94/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLED USD 0.40 LOWER AT USD 58.26/BBL: </strong>Crude prices moved decisively lower through the day amid US-China sentiment souring and a tumble in US ISM Manufacturing PMIs, although did find support at the tail-end of the US session. The losses were led by WTI, which suffered more than Brent, with hurricane Dorian also likely playing its part, but several technical support levels were broken throughout the day in both benchmarks. Some desks have also been attributing weakness to OPEC+ survey data which has been showing slight increases from producers, although Citi’s analyst highlight that the increases were mainly from Nigeria and Iraq, “never the stalwarts of OPEC compliance,” with the pinnacle Saudi output remaining within production limits, alluding to the natural volatility of the data rather than an active deviation from output curbs. API and EIA US energy inventories are both delayed by 24 hours due to US Labor Day on Monday.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (U9) FUTURES SETTLED 13 TICKS HIGHER AT 132-04. </strong>The<strong> </strong>TPLEX<strong> </strong>bull steepened as a tumbling-into-contraction US ISM Manufacturing PMI raised the chances of Fed easing at its September meeting. The ISM figure surprised the market after falling into contraction (49.1), the first time since 2016, swiftly seeing Treasuries leg higher. However, prices since came off their highs, likely a function of the large slate of corporate issuance – 21 IG deals – but desks noted a large chunk of said issuance is expected to swap, providing a limit to the fade. At settlement the curve was generally steeper with the 2s30s widening by over 3bps, although the 5-year yield fell by just under 4.5bps which was slightly more than the 2-year yield’s decline.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.7% AT 2906, NASDAQ-100 -1.1% AT 7610, DOW JONES -1.1% AT 26118, S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.4%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.5%, Energy&nbsp; -0.6%, Financials&nbsp; -1.1%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.6%, Industrials&nbsp; -1.4%, Information Technology&nbsp; -1.3%, Materials&nbsp; -0.9%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -1%, Utilities&nbsp; 1.8%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Amazon (AMZN) outperformed today following a PT rise to USD 2600 from USD 2250 at RBC as they forecast shares to rise nearly 50% on the roll out of US one-day Prime delivery. Boeing (BA) was lower amid further delays to its 777 MAX planes as American Airlines (AAL) also announce a delay to their expected return of the jet, joining United Airlines (UAL) who do not see it ungrounding until December. Apple Insider reported Apple (AAPL) iPhone production is at similar levels of production to the prior year, AAPL traded lower by ~2% for most of the session. American Tower Corp (AMT) also traded higher after it was announced it is entering a new partnership with AT&amp;T (T).&nbsp; The energy sector tracked oil prices throughout the session which weighed on Concho Resources (CXO), who initially traded higher in the pre-market as it is to sell its Mexico Shelf assets for USD 925mln and is to initiate a USD 1.5bln share repurchase programme. Casino Names (WYNN, LVS, MLCO, MGM) were hit as August’s Macau Casino revenue missed expectations where it fell 8.6%, missing estimates for a 4% fall. Semiconductors were mixed, KLA Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) were higher after upgrades at Evercore, however other names Xilinx (XLNX), Micron (MU) &amp; Western Digital (WDC) were lower. Elsewhere in the semiconductor space, Samsung has started replacing Japanese materials with local suppliers for its production of semiconductors, a move which could offset Japan’s restrictions on high-tech exports to South Korea. CBS (CBS) &amp; Viacom (VIAB) were lower after brokerages cut both names’ PT on the deal between the two.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Left rates unchanged at 1.0%, as was expected. The central bank maintained guidance that \"it will will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time\" - crucially, it left in the phrase \"if needed\" which leaves it with some optionality with regards to an October move; some had argued that removing the phrase would have been a more explicit signal of a coming rate cut. There were some other tweaks that received attention: there was a more forceful noting of the weakening global capex cycle; the RBA also removed language about the jobless rate falling to around 5.0% in a couple of years, which was part expected after the recent SOMP saw the central bank's unemployment rate forecast inch higher. Additionally, the final paragraph was tweaked in a way that suggests that, while the labour market is important, it does not seem to be a key driver of policy; the Board will now \"continue to monitor developments, including the labour market,\" whereas previously, it was continuing \"to monitor developments in the labour market closely\" - RBC's analysts said that amid some mixed domestic data, this sentence suggests that the high frequency policy-sensitive data is more important for policy deliberations, and the bank suggests that given that the RBA has made it clear that it expects its policy action and fiscal stimulus to lend some support to households in the coming months, there is some uncertainty about its potential impact. Looking ahead, RBC thinks a clearer picture will emerge later this year. \"The soft data – confidence, business surveys, auction clearance rates as greater volume comes on stream – and the hard data – housing finance approvals, retail sales, motor vehicle purchases – are likely to be top of the RBA’s watching list in the coming months,\" the bank writes, \"the very early signs are mixed which suggests that the RBA will likely sit on the side-lines for a bit longer awaiting a clearer picture unless forced to act by global developments.\" In wake of the decision, money markets price the probability of a 25bps October rate cut with around 60% certainty, little changed compared with before the decision.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD, CNY:</strong> The Dollar Index rose above 99.00 overnight, as US/China trade uncertainties return, while some had also attributed GBP's downside (which is dragging EUR with it) as a support for the buck in early trade too; but the buck went negative after a grim ISM report. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley says the buck is making it more difficult for Chinese authorities to stabilise the yuan. The bank argues that China fixing the RMB stronger than model expectations suggests that authorities may have no interest in a volatility spike ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1st October, explaining that yuan stability often acted as a shock absorber, but with global economic weakness becoming increasingly visible, it will be the stronger USD transmitting global economic weakness into the US, which MS says supports its view that USD strength and strong US risk appetite may not co-exist for long. \"Investors may soon learn that the stronger yuan fixing may not prevent US equity markets from falling,\" and \"what matters for US risk markets is the US growth outlook and its impact on US corporate profitability, and there, the combination of USD strength and global demand weakness do not bode well.\"</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Technicians say that now GBPUSD 1.20 has been given, the door is open to a move lower to 1.15. The folks at ING have introduced a new sterling risk premium tracker, which looks at various measures of sterling stress, gauged by factors like its own short-term financial fair value models, as well as speculative length. The bank says its model signals the risk of no deal Brexit/early election is underpriced by the market, and is looking for more downside to GBP. That theme is certainly in line with other analysts, who have suggested that there is little in the way of positive scenarios for GBP currently, and now 1.20 has been cracked, the post referendum low between 1.1830-40 comes into immediate view. However, with Brexit, the situation is always fluid, and any ground rebel MPs make could engineer aggressive sterling upside, given that positioning remains short; however, many would view GBP rallies as an opportunity to sell back into higher levels. Throughout the session GBPUSD drifted higher towards 1.21 amid ongoing Brexit developments as the opposition pushed to delay Brexit by 3 months in a bill which is expected to pass, a defeat for the government. However, Johnson will look to either call a snap election or delay the motion coming into law if it is passed.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The EUR is under pressure from GBP woes, but also traders focussing attention on next week's ECB. This week's manufacturing PMIs continued to signal the challenges within the Eurozone, and the market is expecting a package of easing from the ECB next week (also seen in today's Bund trading, where yields fell to fresh lows around -74bps). UBS notes that bounces in EURUSD have been very shallow since the break below 1.10 last week, and says that in the last couple of days, it has seen increased downside interest in cash and options from clients, and accordingly, the bank says it still prefers to sell EUR on rallies to the 1.0960-70 region.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> Money market pricing of RBA rate cuts is little changed after the central bank stood pat overnight, and instead, the AUD received some support from a surprise current account surplus, auguring well for Wednesday's Q2 GDP release (analysts see a 0.6% increase from net exports). SocGen argues that, in theory, the surplus supports a higher AUD valuation, but in the case of Australia this is pretty meaningless in the short-term given the central bank is trying to counter trade war headwinds with lower interest rates</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The risk sensitive currency saw downside amid falling oil prices printing lows of 1.3323, just above the 200dma of 1.3312. USDCAD then pared back gains following a weaker dollar after disappointing PMI data in the states.</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong> Turkish inflation cooled by more than expected in August (15.0% Y/Y vs previous 16.7%), and was broad-based, which analysts say leaves the door open for the CBRT to cut rates aggressively at its meeting next week. Capital Economics is expecting a 250bps rate cut next week to&nbsp; 17.25% (NOTE: 300bps is priced), and its analysts say that with inflation likely to dip into single digits in September and October, more easing lies in store; it sees rates being cut to 16.00% by early next year, but warns that risks lie to the downside. However, looking further ahead, CapEco says that inflation is likely to rise again, and the TRY is likely to come under pressure, forcing the MPC to reverse course.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> GDP data surprised to the upside, in a sign the country might avoid recession this year, though the ZAR moves were limited after the knee jerk reaction. Ahead of the data, the argument was that a weak print would strengthen the SARB's case to loosen policy. Nevertheless, the Street still feels that the better than expected growth does little to stop credit rating downgrades linked to debt issues including bailouts for state power utility, Eskom.</p><p><strong>SEK:</strong> Ahead of Thursday's Riksbank rate decision, SEB notes there is a discrepancy between market pricing and its own investor survey. The bank says strong expectations of a rate cut suggest that the Riksbank is unlikely to surprise already very dovish sentiment, and it thinks the risk reward is to be long SEK over the Riksbank. Its own investor survey finds participants are still positioned for lower rates, but have scaled down positions for a flatter curve, and the bank says it sticks with its view that the 2s5s rate trades to flat given Riksbank’s limited possibility to cut the rate much further.</p>",

If the government loses, as seems to be the base case among analysts, UK lawmakers will take control of parliament on Wednesday, and push through legislation to delay Brexit until January 2020; but before the lawmakers can legislate, however, PM Johnson has intimated he'd call general elections. If the government wins (the liklihood of which is diminishing), it would strengthen Johnson's hand, leaving scope for him to force a Brexit -- with or without an exit deal -- on 31st October. A vote on whether elections can take place would likely occur on Wednesday.</li><li>The odds of an election went up today, even before the lawmakers' vote, after Philip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats, leaving Johnson's government without a working majority. There has previously been suggestions that an election could be held on 14th October, ahead of the European Council summit on 17-18th October.</li><li>Recent polling implies the Conservatives would win a majority, Capital Economics observes, noting that the Conservatives have jumped from 21% to 32% in the polls since Johnson became PM, and Electoral Calculus' prediction of the election result based on those polls is even more favourable – predicting a Conservative majority of 62. \"Much would depend on Brexit policies and pacts, as essentially it would be an election on Brexit,\" CapEco writes, \"the Conservatives and Brexit Party may form a pact to hoover up the 'Leave' vote; pacts between 'Remain' parties are also possible, although they seem unlikely to be widespread.\" However, historically, no party has won with such a low vote share before.</li><li>Pantheon Macroeconomics, which sees the most likely outcome of an election a hung parliament, notes mapping national vote shares to seat predictions is not straightforward, given the structure of the first-past-the-post system in the UK. Winning back Brexit party backers might simply lead to bigger Tory majorities in their strongholds, Pantheon says, perhaps not a slew of new seats, and the Tories look set to lose 13 seats in Scotland.</li><li>Campaigning may also see some of the 'Johnson effect' pare back (YouGov polls suggest that 17% of voters do not know who they would vote for, leaving Johnson's lead subject to swings in public sentiment). This all comes in the context of an economy facing challenges; analysts have observed that previous governments have not been re-elected when GFK's gauge of consumer confidence has been so low.</li><li>\"Accordingly,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics argues, \"an election likely wouldn't lead to the reinstatement of a credible threat to leave the EU without a deal\" and in its view, \"the most likely outcome is that parliament remains hung and that Brexit is perpetually delayed. The resulting reduction in no-deal Brexit risk would lift sterling and GDP growth, though not back to pre-referendum levels.\"</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: US-China trade chat, mixed US PMI/ISM, ECB sources and Brexit vote looming",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has back-pedalled on the back of a significantly weaker than forecast US manufacturing ISM (49.1 vs 51.1 consensus) that overshadowed a rebound in the Markit PMI proxy (to just over 50.0) and knocked the <strong>DXY </strong>back below 99.000 from 99.378 at best. The weaker Greenback will no doubt please President Trump who has tweeted more critique aimed mainly at the Fed, but the proof of the pudding will come at September’s FOMC. For now, rate expectations have responded with greater chances of a 50 bp ease priced in (around 15-20% from sub-10% pre-ISM).</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/CHF/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has extended recovery gains vs its US rival, and the Kiwi to within a whisker of 0.6750 and 1.0700+ at best respectively in wake of the aforementioned contractionary US ISM headline reading, a significantly wider than anticipated Q2 Australian Q2 current account surplus and steady/on hold for now RBA. However, Nzd/Usd still seems vulnerable just over 0.6300 following another decline in NZ GDT and WMP prices. Conversely, the safe-haven Yen, Franc and Gold are now all firmer vs the Buck with Usd/Jpy retreating further from 106.00+ peaks and hefty option expiries between 106.15-20 (1.4 bn) to 105.75, Usd/Chf back down through 0.9900 and Xau/Usd not far from 1550/oz as equities fall and broad sentiment sours. Note, risk appetite had improved somewhat after comments from China’s VP He expressing hope for a compromise to solve issues with the US on trade/tariffs following a meeting with 2 Washington officials, but Trump remained adamant that the US is winning and if the dispute continues through the 2020 elections and he prevails then China faces an even tougher deal.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>Sterling and the single currency have both endured wild rides, sometimes in lock-step and also independently as the cross see-sawed on the 0.9100 axis in a circa 100 pip range. The Pound was first to fall asunder after Cable broke below the prior 2019 trough at 1.2015, then 1.2000 and took out more stops residing down at 1.1980 in advance of anti-no deal Brexit rebels launching a bill to block that outcome and force UK PM Johnson to request yet another A 50 extension instead. However, US Dollar’s demise helped Sterling rebound to just over 1.2100 again before a Tory defection left the Government short of a majority and an EU diplomat declared it is now pointless to withdrawal discussions in the circumstances. All eyes now on unfolding developments in Parliament and for detailed analysis with an outlook please refer to the headline feed. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd also posted a fresh ytd low only a few pips away from per-1.0900 support around 1.0923, but bounced firmly as the Greenback recoiled with additional impetus from an ECB sources story suggesting that a package of stimulus next week could comprise a rate cut, tiered depo system and reinforced guidance, even though some GC members favour another round of QE as well. Conversely, the Loonie remains softer vs its US peer after an equally disappointing Canadian manufacturing PMI (Markit version dropped to 49.1 from 50.2) on the eve of the BoC policy meeting (see preview of Wednesday’s event on the headline feed too) with Usd/Cad straddling 1.3350.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aside from the Greenback’s retreat, Usd/Zar and Usd/Try were fuelled by macro impulses and bearish chart signals when key/psychological levels were broken after significantly stronger than anticipated SA Q2 GDP and weaker than expected Turkish inflation data. The Rand briefly climbed above 15.1000 and Lira over 5.7400 before some loss of momentum.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: UK Parliament positioned for a showdown ",
        "content": "<p><strong>*LONG STORY SHORT</strong>: Parliament is due to return from recess today with a bang as MPs scramble to challenge PM Johnson’s move to prorogue Parliament which would significantly narrow the time for Brexit debates, thus upping the chances of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.</p><p><strong>*THE BILL</strong>: The text of the bill which MPs want to use to prevent a no-deal Brexit has been published which, if passed, would mandate PM Johnson to seek a Brexit extension until 31st January 2020 if the PM has not passed a Brexit agreement by 19th October 2019 (the day after the Brexit summit), unless MPs pass a motion to approve a no-deal exit. If the European Council agrees to an extension to the 31 January 2020, then the Prime Minister must immediately accept that extension. If the European Council proposes an extension to a different date then the PM must accept that extension within two days, unless the House of Commons rejects it. MP Hilary Benn stated that the Bill has cross-party support.</p><p><strong>*WHAT’S NEXT? (SEE BELOW FOR A SIMPLIFIED FLOWCHART)</strong></p><ul><li>Today, MPs who oppose a no-deal have lodged an application with House Speaker Bercow regarding time for a Parliamentary debate on the aforementioned Bill. If time is granted, the vote on the Bill could happen later.<strong> (See below for today's indicative schedule)</strong></li><li>If 50% of MPs vote in favour of the Bill, it will be rushed through the House of Lords and written into law ahead of next week’s Parliament suspension. Desks highlight that this is not impossible given that a similar bill (Cooper-Letwin Bill) made it into law within three days back in April.</li><li>Suggestions have been made that the Government could delay the Bill from passing into law before Parliament is prorogued. Furthermore, PM Johnson could also call for a General Election before Parliament is suspended, which would require the <strong>backing of 2/3 of the 650 MPs</strong> in order to trigger a poll in Autumn, under the Fixed Term Parliament Act (FTPA)<i>. [N.B. PM Johnson can get around the 2/3 majority needed by passing a bill that says \"“notwithstanding the FTPA, we will have a general election on XX date”]</i> PM Johnson has warned that if lawmakers vote for another Brexit delay on Tuesday, there will be a vote for a General Election on Wednesday with the view to conduct the vote on <strong>14th October</strong> rather than accept another Brexit delay, while reports also suggested that Johnson wants an election before the EU Council meeting scheduled for 17th-18th October.</li><li>If the vote on the Bill to delay Brexit is defeated, Opposition Leader Corbyn could immediately put forth a motion of no confidence in the Government. This vote could take place on 5th September.</li><li>If the government losses the no-confidence vote, then MPs could attempt to form a caretaker government with the purpose of delaying Brexit and holding a General Election after.

PM Johnson also reiterated his argument that getting a deal would be made impossible if MPs vote for a Brexit delay (as it would remove the threat of no deal) and that the UK is to leave on 31st October as he will not ask for a delay under any circumstances but believes UK will get a deal at the October EU summit.

Like yesterday, stops were triggered in Cable once the previous 1.2015 ytd low was breached and again through the psychological 1.2000 before another round was tripped on a break of 1.1980 that sat just below 1.1986-83 ‘support’ from mid-May 2017. The selling has subsequently abated even though construction PMI missed expectations in line with Monday’s manufacturing headline print, but Sterling remains weak and extending relative declines vs G10 pears with Eur/Gbp firmly above 0.9100 and Gbp/Jpy hovering around 127.00 after an order driven lurch to circa 126.70 at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/CHF - </strong>In contrast to the underperforming Pound, and despite ongoing strength in the Greenback (ie DXY up to 99.356 at best), the Aussie and Yen are at the top of the major ranks, as Aud/Usd reclaims 0.6700+ status and Usd/Jpy slips back to test underlying bids/support around 106.00. No change in rates or wait-and-see guidance from the RBA overnight has helped the Aussie stabilise amidst the ongoing US-China trade stalemate and further Yuan weakness, while a broader downturn in risk sentiment is keeping the Yen underpinned alongside Gold, but not the Franc uniformly. Indeed, Usd/Chf is still holding above 0.9900, while Eur/Chf creeps deeper below 1.0850, albeit largely due to Euro depreciation on top of no verbal intervention from the SNB, so far.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/EUR - </strong>The Loonie and Kiwi have both lost more ground relative to their US peer (and latter against the aforementioned recovering Aussie as Aud/Nzd eyes 1.0700), with Usd/Cad climbing above 1.3350 ahead of NA Markit manufacturing PMIs, and ISM in the US, while Nzd/Usd has pulled back under 0.6300 into the latest GDT auction and not really gleaning support from NZ Finance Minister Robertson noting some robust domestic data and firm economic fundamentals, as he also stated that the Government is ready to react in the case of a shock.

Similarly, Bunds are pausing for breath after just eclipsing their previous best, at 179.67, and perhaps -75 bp in cash terms proved sticky, while US Treasuries are hovering just shy of overnight session highs awaiting desks to return stateside from the long holiday weekend.

As the bank has frequently noted, these investors have taken a bullish stance based on strong macro fundamentals of the US economy as of late (moving into equities from bonds). As such a key determinant of sentiment this week is likely to be US macroeconomic data releases, with focus inevitably centred around ISM and NFP data. “If the incoming macroeconomic data proves conspicuously disappointing, and if global macro hedge funds were to respond by exiting enough long positions in equities to pull the S&amp;P 500 down to below 2,860” the bank posits, “algo investors would probably return to a preference for bear trades”.</li><li>Nomura notes that systematic CTA players have been closing out some of their long 10-year UST future positions. According to their model, Nomura says that CTAs' net buying of TY since 1 August (which makes up roughly 30% of their total net long position) breaks even at a 10-year UST yield of about 1.56%, making this a level to watch. Should yield move above this point, Nomura see the next trigger line in for CTAs at around 1.79%, the break-even line for CTA net buying since June.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has racked up more losses in advance of UK Parliament reconvening after the Summer break and in anticipation of a showdown between anti-no deal politicians across party divides and PM Johnson’s pro-Brexiteers. Like yesterday, stops were triggered in Cable once the previous 1.2015 ytd low was breached and again through the psychological 1.2000 before another round was tripped on a break of 1.1980 that sat just below 1.1986-83 ‘support’ from mid-May 2017. The selling has subsequently abated even though construction PMI missed expectations in line with Monday’s manufacturing headline print, but Sterling remains weak and extending relative declines vs G10 pears with Eur/Gbp firmly above 0.9100 and Gbp/Jpy hovering around 127.00 after an order driven lurch to circa 126.70 at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>In contrast to the underperforming Pound, and despite ongoing strength in the Greenback (ie <strong>DXY</strong> up to 99.356 at best), the Aussie and Yen are at the top of the major ranks, as Aud/Usd reclaims 0.6700+ status and Usd/Jpy slips back to test underlying bids/support around 106.00. No change in rates or wait-and-see guidance from the RBA overnight has helped the Aussie stabilise along with a healthy Q2 current account balance amidst the ongoing US-China trade stalemate and further Yuan weakness, while a broader downturn in risk sentiment is keeping the Yen underpinned alongside Gold, but not the Franc uniformly. Indeed, Usd/Chf is still holding above 0.9900, while Eur/Chf creeps deeper below 1.0850, albeit largely due to Euro depreciation on top of no verbal intervention from the SNB, so far.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/EUR</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Kiwi have both lost more ground relative to their US peer (and latter against the aforementioned recovering Aussie as Aud/Nzd eyes 1.0700), with Usd/Cad climbing above 1.3350 ahead of NA Markit manufacturing PMIs, and ISM in the US, while Nzd/Usd has pulled back under 0.6300 into the latest GDT auction and not really gleaning support from NZ Finance Minister Robertson noting some robust domestic data and firm economic fundamentals, as he also stated that the Government is ready to react in the case of a shock. Elsewhere, the single currency continues to decline as noted above, and closer to 1.0923 support ahead of 1.0900, but may find some traction from hefty option expiries close by (2 bn between 1.0945-50).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Rand and Lira look technically and fundamentally ripe to claw back ground vs the Buck, with Usd/Zar reversing from almost 15.2900 towards 15.1250 and Usd/Try touching 5.7650 compared to 5.8220 at the other extreme in wake of SA GDP and Turkish CPI that confounded forecasts on the upside and downside respectively.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The RBA is expected to keep rates unchanged at the record low 1.00% in its latest policy meeting today with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures pricing in 87% expectations for no change in rates and a 13% chance of a 25bps cut, while its implied yield curve points to a 25bps cut at the October meeting and another similar reduction to 0.50% in December.</p><p>The wide expectations for the RBA to remain on hold for a consecutive meeting are mainly due to the close proximity since the last policy adjustments in which it delivered back-to-back cuts in June and July. It would therefore be prudent for the central bank to bide its time and gauge the impact on the economy from its past adjustments. Nonetheless, additional policy loosening for the year is seen to remain firmly on the table given the ongoing US-China trade war, global growth slowdown and declining rates across the world's central banks including the Fed which recently cut rates for the first time in a decade and last month's surprise 50bps bonanza by the RBNZ. In addition, the quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy noted the board is prepared to ease policy if needed and are observing the labour market, while it added that it is reasonable to expect an extended period of low rates and included the technical assumption for rates to decline to 0.75% by year-end in its economic forecasts.</p><p>Other comments from the central bank point to a lack of urgency to act again so soon as RBA Governor Lowe stated at the recent Semi Annual Testimony that he thought it was appropriate to wait and assess developments after having cut rates in quick succession but added the board is prepared to ease further to meet goals and suggested scenarios where zero rates could be considered such as if all central banks go to zero or if the economy weakens well below expectations. However, Governor Lowe also noted the fiscal option should be on the table if demand weakens and that the economy may have reached a \"gentle turning point\". Elsewhere, Assistant Governor Kent thinks it is unlikely that very low or negative rates will be needed in Australia but still noted that low interest rates and some unconventional policies are possible, while Deputy Governor Debelle hopes the RBA never have to get down to minimum rate levels seen in other developed countries.</p><p>The recent data has been mixed and therefore favours a wait and see approach as Employment Change topped estimates in July at 41.1k vs. Exp. 14.0k (Prev. 0.5k) which was predominantly driven by an increase in Full Time Employment and although the Unemployment Rate remained at 5.2% as expected, this coincided with an increase in the Participation Rate. Furthermore, Building Approvals disappointed at -9.7% vs. Exp. 0.0% (Prev. -1.2%) and there was a surprise contraction in Private Capital Expenditure for Q2 at -0.5% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. -1.7%) although the latest 2019-2020 Private Capex estimate was revised higher to 113.4B (Prev. 99.14B), while the looming Q2 GDP figures for Australia due this Wednesday adds to the case for the RBA to stand pat.</p><p>The rate decision is due at 0530BST/2330CDT/1230HKT and aside from the actual rate decision, the focus will also be on the statement as any clues which support market expectations for a rate cut in October will likely pressure AUD, while a lack thereof could trigger some unwinding of the dovish bets for the remainder of the year and underpin the currency.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls</p><p>AMP Capital and Barclays both expect the RBA to cut rates in September and November this year.</p><p>CBA forecasts the RBA will lower rates by 25bps in November and February to take the Cash Rate Target to 0.50%.</p>",

GBP/USD also languishes around 1.2050 after the prior day’s losses that were triggered by Brexit uncertainty and election risk with opposition MPs and Tory rebels planning to push through legislation to force a 3-month delay if a deal cannot be reached by 19th of October, although PM Johnson hopes to quell these efforts with the threat of a snap election which could result to a greater majority for the government. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed with the divergence driven by their base currencies, while antipodeans are lacklustre in which AUD/USD and NZD/USD slipped below 0.6700 and 0.6300 respectively after CNH recently hit fresh record lows and with participants digesting mixed data in which Australia posted its first Current Account surplus in over 4 decades and stronger than expected net exports contribution ahead of tomorrow’s GDP, but missed on Retail Sales.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as prices track the pullback in T-notes and with participants sidelined ahead of the 10yr JGB auction later.</p>",
