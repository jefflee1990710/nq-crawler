Analysts also note a lack of upside risk ahead of Powell’s Testimony before Congress on Wednesday, in addition to a lack of share buybacks in the pre-earnings season blackout. Ahead of this week’s supply, the Treasury curve flattened with the front-end yields rising, and the long-end yields falling. The buck built on post NFP gains, whilst crude moved higher, albeit erasing the majority of the day’s gains just before settlement, with participants weighing geopolitical tensions and demand concerns as conflicting driving forces.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Overnight,<strong> </strong>Japan imposed restrictions on Korean semi-conductor and display material exports, citing national security concerns. Analysts say the latest news highlights that while a US/China trade truce was reached after the G20, global trade developments still have the capacity to introduce further downside risks to the world economy. The SOX index of semiconductors slumped to losses during US hours on the news. Elsewhere, US/China trade tensions continue to bubble: China is expecting to use its plan to name foreign companies that are a national security risk as a bargaining chip in trade talks with US. Additionally, an SCMP columnist has suggested we ignore the hype, and that US President Trump and Chinese President Xi are no closer to an agreement. Moving to the US/EU trade front; EU trade chief Malmstrom reiterated that the EU will not include agriculture in US trade talks. NOTE: agriculture is a key area US President Trump has wanted to show US gains in trade talks, since the industry is one of Trump's key support groups. Malmstrom also said he fears a tariff fight with the US over aircraft aid and repeated EU readiness to negotiate in this area.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> Iran has further deviated from the 2015 nuclear deal pact, as expected; an Iran Nuclear Agency spokesperson announced that it has now surpassed the 3.67% uranium enrichment cap, which was later confirmed by a UN atomic watchdog. The spokesperson also said that it was considering enriching uranium at a level greater than 20%, and the next measures in withdrawing from the pact will be greater than the previous. Following the US’ exit from the agreement, the Europeans are the remaining signatories on the pact, and an extended violation from Iran could lead the implementation of tariffs, commentators have noted. In a similar vein, US VP Pence said on Monday that Iran should not confuse US restraint with a lack of US resolve, reiterating Trump’s stance that war is not desired and talks are preferred, but the US will not back down, adding that the US is prepared to protect US interests and personnel in the region. French President Macron's top diplomatic advisors will be travelling to Iran tomorrow and on Wednesday in an attempt to de-escalate US/Iran tensions. Elsewhere, Saudi TV reported that the Saudi-led Coalition Navy had foiled an attempt by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, which reportedly targeted a commercial ship in the Red Sea; however, the Houthis later denied the claims.</p><p><strong>* GREECE ELECTIONS</strong>: Centre-right New Democracy beat Tsipras' leftist Syriza; new prime minister Mitsotakis will be able to govern with a majority of MPs, and will not have to rely on a coalition partner. UBS has recommended Greek debt to clients on the back of strong (post-restructuring) near-term fiscal profile, relative economic resilience, the prospect of upgrades by rating agencies, and political stability. \"Overnight events imply the rally can extend, and a sense of bond market normality could mean Greece trades closer to regional peers such as Portugal,\" the bank said.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> <strong>ECB's Villeroy</strong> suggested that the central bank has \"several\" meetings to assess the economy, and would act with determination if it needed to act; Villeroy's interview with CNBC comes after a sources report last week hinted that some policymakers saw no urgency to rush into a rate cut at the July meeting.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 38bln of new 3-year notes, USD 24bln 10-year re-opening, and USD 16bln 30-year bonds this week. Analysts at UBS says this implied USD 26bln of new cash (ex SOMA-holdings), split between USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupon payments. Desks have noted that this week's supply will be the first long-end Treasury supply since the June FOMC; the auctions will also be complicated by Fed chair Powell's dual-testimonies to lawmakers (Wed/Thu), with the market looking for signs of whether the Fed is still mulling a July insurance rate cut, now that markets have priced out the prospect of a 'doub'e rate cut, consisting of 50bps. The market is, however, still pricing in a 25bps for the July meeting. The 10-year auction will also be interesting after yields on benchmark 10s recently fell below the 2% handle, though have made its way back above the level in Monday. Analysts at BMO will be watching out for domestic investor fund participation at this cycle's auctions; The bank notes that the funds seem undeterred by the continual bullish repricings in USTs as June's 3-, 10- and 30-year auctions, which showed the largest share on record allocated to that type of investor. Recent averages imply the 3-year auction will tail 0.2bps, covered 2.52x; the breakdown is seen as 38.00% to dealers, 16.3% to directs, and 45.7% to indirects.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 1 TICK HIGHER AT 127-16: </strong>The curve flattened, as traders continue to price out the prospects of a 50bps rate cut at the FOMC's July meeting, after the recent payrolls data placed less urgency on the central bank to fire an insurance rate cut, while the trade truce reached at the G20 last week also mitigates some of the immediate downside risks facing the US/global economy. At settlement the 2s/30s flattened the pronounced by 3.8bps, with the 2-year yield rising just under 1.5bps and the 30-year falling by just under 2.5bps. It is worth noting that markets still expect an insurance cut at the July meeting, where the implied probability of a July cut is around 97% on Monday; desks have been increasingly noting that the Fed has historically rarely disappointed when market expectations have been so aggressive. That is in spite of the economy ticking along nicely.

It is hoped now that Fed Chair Powell will reveal some of the Fed's thinking at his dual testimonies this week (Wed/Thu).</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLE USD 0.15 HIGHER AT USD 57.66/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.12 LOWER AT USD 64.11/BBL: </strong>Energy markets drifted modestly higher to start the week, before reversing course before settlement, following a strong jobs report on Friday providing a mixed signal to a market preparing for rate cuts. Geopolitical tensions in Iran remain price supportive, with Iran making further deviations from the 2015 nuclear pact. At the same time, demand concerns remain a major hurdle for bulls given the global signals of faltering growth across major economies. RBC’s analysts highlighted that in the past five years, the oil market has been supply driven, but going ahead it is more likely be demand driven, making it materially harder to find an equilibrium. RBC also notes that refinery utilisation margins are weak in many regions globally, such as Asia and the Mediterranean, in a time where it should be strong due to peak summer time trends, which the bank believes could be an ominous demand signal, or an excessive supply one, or both.

Dollar strength post-NFP has kept the <strong>EUR</strong> close to the 1.12 handle. The single currency was unmoved by a market-friendly election outcome in Greece, desks have said that this may be due to less perceived risk around Greece now (when Syriza took power in 2015, the spread between Bunds and Greek 10-year was around 1500bps, but that spread has now narrowed to around 250bps).

Technicians say 1.2481 is the next key support to the downside (the post-NFP low). <strong>AUD</strong>: Data showed job adverts rebounding in June (+4.6% M/M vs -8.2% M/M in May), but Aussie has relinquished 0.70 in the face of the buck strength, and in spite of yuan stability, helping it to largely shrug-off ramping up of tensions between key Asian economies Japan and South Korea. <strong>EMFX</strong> look set to take cues from what sort of a message Powell sends about insurance rate cuts (erring dovishly should generally keep EMFX supported, analysts say, while any push-back may heap pressure on the complex). The <strong>MXN</strong> and <strong>BRL</strong> traded firmer despite USD strength, with hawkish Banxico said to be supporting the peso, while <strong>BRL</strong> investors positioned for a positive outcome in the upcoming pension vote. <strong>TRY </strong>sunk after CBRT independence took a major hit: President Erdogan had<strong> </strong>Governor Centinkaya fired, replacing him with his deputy (and new) Governor Uysal, Turkish media reported. No official reason has been provided, but press reports suggest it was as a result of Centinkaya's refusal to cut interest rates was the driving factor, something President Erdogan has repeatedly called for previously. SocGen's analysts now see sharp rate cuts coming, perhaps as soon as the 25th July meeting.</p>",

At settlement the 2s/30s flattened the pronounced by 3.8bps, with the 2-year yield rising just under 1.5bps and the 30-year falling by just under 2.5bps. It is worth noting that markets still expect an insurance cut at the July meeting, where the implied probability of a July cut is around 97% on Monday; desks have been increasingly noting that the Fed has historically rarely disappointed when market expectations have been so aggressive. That is in spite of the economy ticking along nicely. Deutsche Bank's analysts said the strength of the NFP data calls into question whether the Fed should be cutting three times this year at all – the market is currently pricing around 67bps. It is hoped now that Fed Chair Powell will reveal some of the Fed's thinking at his dual testimonies this week (Wed/Thu).</p>",

On that note, Friday’s US jobs data has raised the bar for the July FOMC in terms aggressive easing as a ½ point ease has now been virtually priced out, but President Trump has not relented from his criticism of the Fed for keeping monetary policy too tight. In fact, he was arguably even more adamant that Powell and co pose the biggest problem for the domestic economy not the country’s competitors and the policy-makers are clueless, as rates would be lower if they knew what to do.</p><p><strong>TRY</strong></p><p>The Lira is off worst levels, but still reeling after the even more radical action taken by Turkish President Erdogan to influence the CBRT and lower official rates. To recap, Deputy Central Bank head Uysal was handed the reins after the sacking of Cetinkaya due to the latter not cutting benchmarks last month and/or signalling enough of a move at the July 25 policy meeting. However, the onus is now on Uysal to deliver as markets are pricing in at least 100 bp worth of easing. Usd/Try is hovering around 5.7270 within a 5.7930-5.6300 range and the AK Party also announced plans to align CBRT reserves with trade laws.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lagging their G10 peers and extending losses vs the Greenback as the Franc edged down towards 0.9950 and just shy of 1.1150 against the Euro, while the Yen hit 108.72 in wake of weaker than expected Japanese machinery orders data and Usd/Jpy climbed further away from decent option expiry interest in the low 108.00 zone.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>The single currency and Sterling are both struggling to stay above big figures vs the Greenback, at 1.1200 and 1.2500 respectively, with the former plagued by more worrying Eurozone data/survey news and the latter still suffering from UK political and Brexit uncertainty. In terms technicals, Eur/Usd has near term support from 1.1180-70 and Cable traded down to circa 1.2480 in wake of last Friday’s US jobs data, but comments from BoE’s Haldane may offer fresh direction.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs their US counterpart, as the Kiwi erased all its recovery gains to retest 0.6624 lows and the Loonie slipped back towards 1.3100 despite firmer oil prices and the looming BoC meeting on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Aussie retreated a tad further from highs not far from 0.7000 to around 0.6970 in wake of overnight press reports playing down the G20 US-China trade truce on the basis that there is still a way to go before any deal is done, adding that China could use a list of foreign companies that pose a security threat as a bargaining chip.</p>",

(-2.6%)</strong> were the laggards after continued PBoC liquidity inaction and further clashes between police and protesters who have now targeted tourist areas in Kowloon. In addition, there were suggestions the US-China trade truce at the G20 has done little to bring the sides closer to an actual trade agreement and it is also expected that China could use its plan to name foreign companies a national security risk, as a bargaining chip in trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as they tracked the decline in T-notes and rebound in yields in the aftermath of the strong US jobs data, with the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributing to the lack of demand for bonds.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: Kiwi leads G10 comeback, but Lira lags after CBRT loses its head",
        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/TRY</strong></p><p>Vastly contrasting starts to the new week for the Kiwi and Lira, as Nzd/Usd rebounds firmly from post-NFP lows to probe above 0.6650, but Usd/Try extends gains to just over 5.7930 at one stage on the back of further Government intervention aimed at forcing the Turkish CB to cut rates. In short, President Erdogan sacked CBRT chief Cetinkaya over the weekend by decree and put Deputy Governor Uysal in charge and it seems that the failure to cut rates at the June policy meeting and/or not signalling sufficiently aggressive easing for this month prompted the decree and change of leadership.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has eased back from Friday’s headline payrolls peaks across the board, not just against the Kiwi as noted above, with the <strong>DXY </strong>unable to sustain momentum or breach 97.500 to expose the next upside technical objective. Another verbal lashing from US President Trump about the Fed not helping the economy, along the lines of his Turkish counterpart may be weighing on the index and Greenback generally, as markets brace for Powell’s semi-annual testimony to gauge whether easing is on the cards for the July FOMC, and more importantly if there is more than merely an insurance cut in the offing. On that note, markets are 97.5% certain that Funds will be lowered by 25 bp vs just 2.5% still looking for -50 bp.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The next best major, but capped ahead of 0.7000 as the Aud/Nzd cross drifts back down to 1.0500 from rebound highs posted in wake of last week’s RBA rate cut and tweak in guidance to signal a pause after 2 in a row.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CAD/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed against the Usd as Cable consolidates in a narrow range north of 1.2500 and the Yen pares some losses between 108.58-29 amidst weaker than forecast Japanese data (machinery orders) and with decent option expiry interest sitting just below (1.2 bn from 108.25-15 and 1 bn from 108.05-00). Meanwhile, the Loonie has also found its footing after underperforming on Friday when Canadian jobs data revealed an unexpected decline, but the breakdown was not as bleak, with Usd/Cad meandering in a 1.3062-83 range, and the single currency has shrugged off a surprise deterioration in Sentix sentiment to hold above 1.1200 in a 1.1219-34 band. Note, expiries could keep Eur/Usd in check given 2.5 bn sitting at 1.1250-55 and 1.1260-65, while the Franc is midway between 0.9900-19 and straddling 1.1125 vs the Euro in lacklustre mood overall.</p>",

As such, markets have only priced in a less than 5% chance of a 50bps rate cut at this month’s FOMC vs. more than 32% over a week ago and the probability of a 25bps cut is now at over 95%. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> traded rangebound and failed to make any significant recovery from Friday’s pressure in which the latter briefly gave up the 1.2500 handle to the downside, while the latest YouGov polls over the weekend also showed that UK PM candidate and hardcore Brexiteer Boris Johnson was firmly in the lead with 74% of support vs. 26% for Jeremy Hunt. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were little changed with only minimal flows seen into the safe-haven <strong>JPY</strong> despite the deterioration in risk sentiment and <strong>antipodeans</strong> also followed suit to the humdrum tone, while the biggest mover was <strong>TRY</strong> which weakened more than 2% against <strong>USD</strong> after the Turkish Central Bank Governor was ousted and replaced by his deputy which President Erdogan stated was due to the former Governor’s unwillingness to lower rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turkey Central Bank Governor Cetinkaya was removed from position and replaced by Deputy Governor Uysal in which President Erdogan cited a refusal to cut rates as the reason behind the dismissal. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were uneventful overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures holding onto last Friday’s US gains where prices reclaimed the USD 57.00/bbl level which then later acted as support. In terms of fundamentals, it was reported that Saudi Arabia output was at 9.8mln BPD in June vs. 9.7mln BPD in May which although is a slight increased, remains comfortably below the OPEC+ commitment of 10.3mln BPD, and geopolitical concerns continue to linger as Iran confirmed it will scale back commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was lacklustre following its recent slip below USD 1400/oz in the aftermath of the NFP data although prices within close proximity for an attempt to reclaim the level, while <strong>copper</strong> conformed to the rangebound trade across the complex and has so far shrugged off the negative risk tone in the region as well as the hefty losses in its largest buyer China. Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh said he is hopeful that Iran’s crude oil exports will improve, while he added that the price of oil is not Iran's main concern and that what matters is the amount Iran can export.

Bear-flattening was the play after the data, and there was a significant paring back in the implied probabilities of a 50bps rate cut at the Fed’s July meeting – the probability has now fallen to just 0.5% from around 27% before the data, though the market is still completely priced for a 25bps cut; money markets now price 60bps of easing through the end of the year, compared to 75bps at the close of business on Thursday. Interestingly, Treasuries only marginally recovered from lows, despite equities paring back the NFP-induced slide. US T-note futures (U9) settled 25 ticks lower at 127-15.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said the Fed does not have a clue and that the most difficult problem for the US is the Fed</strong> and not the nation’s competitors, while he separately commented that the Fed would lower rates if it knew what it was doing. Furthermore, Trump said that China is devaluing its currency and that the UK Ambassador to the US has not served the UK well. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed Board nominee Shelton</strong> said the jobs report shows Trump’s agenda is working, while she added that she does not want the Fed to 'pull the rug' from under the market and that markets are not wrong in questioning the yield curve. Furthermore, Shelton echoed Trump comments on ECB looking to devalue the EUR and suggested that competitive devaluation is cheating not competing. (Newswires)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week with firm losses as the region reacted to the weakness last Friday on Wall St where better than expected NFP jobs data dampened Fed rate cut hopes. ASX 200 (-1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) were lower in which the commodity-related sectors led the broad declines in Australia, especially gold miners after the precious metal slipped below the USD 1400/oz level as a function of a stronger USD and tempered rate cut calls, while Tokyo sentiment was also downbeat as participants digested data releases including a contraction in Machinery Orders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.5%) were the laggards after continued PBoC liquidity inaction and further clashes between police and protesters who have now targeted tourist areas in Kowloon. In addition, there were suggestions the US-China trade truce at the G20 has done little to bring the sides closer to an actual trade agreement and it is also expected that China could use its plan to name foreign companies a national security risk, as a bargaining chip in trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as they tracked the decline in T-notes and rebound in yields in the aftermath of the strong US jobs data, with the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributing to the lack of demand for bonds.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week negative as the region reacts to the weakness last Friday on Wall St where the major indices finished lower after better than expected NFP jobs data dampened Fed rate cut hopes. ASX 200 (-1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) are lower with the commodity-related sectors leading the broad declines in Australia especially gold miners after the precious metal slipped below the USD 1400/oz level as a function of a stronger USD and tempered rate cut calls, while Tokyo sentiment is also downbeat as participants digest latest data releases including a contraction in Machinery Orders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.6%) are the laggards after continued PBoC liquidity inaction and further clashes between police and protesters who have now targeted tourist areas in Kowloon. In addition, there were suggestions the US-China trade truce at the G20 has done little to bring the sides closer to an actual trade agreement and it is also expected that China could use its plan to name foreign companies a national security risk, as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is relatively stable although has slightly pulled back from post-NFP highs in which the better than expected jobs data dampened hopes of a rate cut by the Fed later this month and pushed the DXY back above the 97.00 level. As such, markets have only priced in a less than 5% chance of a 50bps rate cut at this month’s FOMC vs. more than 32% over a week ago and the probability of a 25bps cut is now at over 95%. EUR/USD and GBP/USD trade rangebound and have failed to make any significant recovery from Friday’s weakness in which the latter briefly gave up the 1.2500 handle to the downside, while the latest YouGov polls over the weekend also showed that UK PM candidate and hardcore Brexiteer Boris Johnson is firmly in the lead with 74% of support vs. 26% for Jeremy Hunt. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are little changed with only minimal flows seen into the safe-haven JPY despite the deterioration in risk sentiment and antipodeans are also uneventful, while the biggest mover has been TRY which weakened more than 2% against USD after the Turkish Central Bank Governor was ousted and replaced by his deputy which President Erdogan stated was due to the former Governor’s unwillingness to lower rates.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they track the weakness in T-notes and rebound in yields in the aftermath of the strong US jobs data, with the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributing to the lack of demand for bonds.</p>",
