Facebook (FB) held on to pre-market gains as the company reported profits that beat analyst expectations. Fellow technology heavyweight Microsoft (MSFT) also traded higher after reporting earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines, including a revenue beat in their cloud computing division. Tesla (TSLA) could not recoup pre-market losses after the electric automaker released earnings that missed on both top and bottom-line expectations, whilst also facing a number of broker downgrades. Comcast (CMCSA) shares jumped after hours after the telecoms conglomerate reported a beat in bottom line earnings for Q1. Disney (DIS) gained on the news that the entertainment co. was in talks with Comcast regarding the purchase of its 30% stake in Hulu. American Express (AXP) shares moved higher throughout the session following earnings beats from competitors Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL). Boeing (BA) shares rose after Southwest Airlines (LUV) expressed confidence in the aeroplane manufacturer, saying they see 737 Max aircraft back on schedule before the end of the year. Verizon (VZ) rose after the telecoms co. announced it would pause its plans to charge an extra USD 10 per month for devices with 5G access. AbbVie (ABBV) was initially buoyed after the pharma co. reported better than expected sales and earnings, but quickly gave back these gains on reports of testing issues. UPS (UPS) shares fell after the air freight co. reported earnings that missed analyst expectations, blaming the hit to poor weather conditions in Q1. Xilinx (XLNX) shares were hit despite the technology firm reporting earnings largely in line with expectations, as the company announced that it would acquire Solarflare Communications and disclosed no terms. SPX -0.0% at 2926, NDX +0.4% at 7816, DJI -0.5% at 26462.</p><p>It has been a subdued session, ahead of tomorrow's GDP data, FOMC and NFP next week. Durable goods data was mixed, but some bank desks raised their trackers ahead of tomorrow's Q1 GDP print, suggesting that there might be some upside to the 2.1% consensus view for Q1. Some have noted that the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker was revised lower slightly after the data, but it is still worth pointing out that it was tracking zero growth at the beginning of the year, and now at 2.7%, suggests that the quarter was not as bad as had been feared in January, as risk sentiment soured, and the Fed subsequently pivoted dovish. Nevertheless, Treasury yields were flattish on Thursday, with a slight bias towards higher. The US sold 7yr paper in an average auction; a tail of 0.5bps bucks this week's trend of 'on the screws' auctions; the indirect bid was eyed after the decent performance at the 5s auction on Wednesday, and although it slipped slightly, it was still slightly better than the three auction average -- some have speculated that high US hedging costs could see foreign bidders participate in US auctions unhedged, which might provide support for the buck. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, but not significant. US T-note futures (M9) settled 4+ ticks lower at 123-12.</p>",

Ex-transport was +0.4%, and core durable goods rose 1.3% (some suggest this is hard to reconcile with the fall in the ISM manufacturing index in recent months -- either way, it could augur well for ), though core shipments missed slightly. Inventories of durable goods rose 0.3%. \"We boosted our Q1 GDP forecast by two tenths to +2.6% (qoq ar) ahead of tomorrow's advance release,\" Goldman Sachs says, \"reflecting the firm pace of durable inventory growth and the surprising rebound in commercial aircraft shipments in March.\" The Bank's preliminary April Current Activity Indicator stands at +2.2% (vs. +2.3% in March); the consensus expects 2.1% US GDP growth in Q1.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong>&nbsp;US Trade Representative Lighthizer announced that the US would keep China on the ‘priority watch list’ of nations who do not adequately protect intellectual property rights. He also that China had failed to make fundamental structural changes to strengthen intellectual property protection and enforcement. The US also added Saudi Arabia to the priority watch list, citing a deterioration in the protection of intellectual property for pharmaceutical products. Mexican President Obrador said that he didn’t want to see labour used a pre-text to block the USMCA; this comes after the head of the largest US labour union announced that he opposed the ratification of the USMCA on Tuesday. He voiced doubts that Mexico would adequately enforce the required labour reforms, a concern shared by the Democrats, some of whom will need to be won over if the bill is to pass the US House of Representatives. Elsewhere, the UK and China agreed to hold a next round of economic and financial talks in London this June, talks that will “continue the golden era of relations between China and the UK” said UK Chancellor Hammond.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.0% at 2926, NDX +0.4% at 7816, DJI -0.5% at 26462.

Facebook (FB) held on to pre-market gains as the company reported profits that beat analyst expectations. Fellow technology heavyweight Microsoft (MSFT) also traded higher after reporting earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines, including a revenue beat in their cloud computing division. Tesla (TSLA) could not recoup pre-market losses after the electric automaker released earnings that missed on both top and bottom-line expectations, whilst also facing a number of broker downgrades. Comcast (CMCSA) shares jumped after hours after the telecoms conglomerate reported a beat in bottom line earnings for Q1. Disney (DIS) gained on the news that the entertainment co. was in talks with Comcast regarding the purchase of its 30% stake in Hulu. American Express (AXP) shares moved higher throughout the session following earnings beats from competitors Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL). Boeing (BA) shares rose after Southwest Airlines (LUV) expressed confidence in the aeroplane manufacturer, saying they see 737 Max aircraft back on schedule before the end of the year. Verizon (VZ) rose after the telecoms co. announced it would pause its plans to charge an extra USD 10 per month for devices with 5G access. AbbVie (ABBV) was initially buoyed after the pharma co. reported better than expected sales and earnings, but quickly gave back these gains on reports of testing issues. UPS (UPS) shares fell after the air freight co. reported earnings that missed analyst expectations, blaming the hit to poor weather conditions in Q1. Xilinx (XLNX) shares were hit despite the technology firm reporting earnings largely in line with expectations, as the company announced that it would acquire Solarflare Communications and disclosed no terms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) SETTLES USD 0.68 LOWER AT USD 65.12/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD 0.22 LOWER AT USD 74.35/BBL. </strong>The crude complex traded choppy before finishing lower on Thursday, with Brent making new YTD highs during the day, as concerns grew regarding how the US’s recently announced end to Iranian crude import waivers will impact supply. The halting of crude oil loadings from Russia’s Ust-Luga port on concerns of contamination only added to the bullish sentiment. WTI failed to rally to the same extent amid the overhang of this week’s bearish Inventory data; as well as US officials reaffirming their commitment to working with partners to ensure sufficient supply. However, WTI continues to trade at near YTD highs, with UBS noting that the market continues to focus on the supply/demand outlook and geopolitical tensions. Citi analysts note that, despite US assurances, it is hard to argue that a substantial reduction in Iranian exports will not translate into higher oil prices, given that the combination of sanctions against both Iran and Venezuela leave oil market supply conditions tighter than they would otherwise have been.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 123-12.</strong> It has been a subdued session, ahead of tomorrow's GDP data, FOMC and NFP next week. Durable goods data was mixed, but some bank desks raised their trackers ahead of tomorrow's Q1 GDP print, suggesting that there might be some upside to the 2.1% consensus view for Q1. Some have noted that the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker was revised lower slightly after the data, but it is still worth pointing out that it was tracking zero growth at the beginning of the year, and now at 2.7%, suggests that the quarter was not as bad as had been feared in January, as risk sentiment soured, and the Fed subsequently pivoted dovish. Nevertheless, Treasury yields were flattish on Thursday, with a slight bias towards higher. The US sold 7yr paper in an average auction; a tail of 0.5bps bucks this week's trend of 'on the screws' auctions; the indirect bid was eyed after the decent performance at the 5s auction on Wednesday, and although it slipped slightly, it was still slightly better than the three auction average -- some have speculated that high US hedging costs could see foreign bidders participate in US auctions unhedged, which might provide support for the buck. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, but not significant.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> King USD continues to reign ahead of Friday's Q1 GDP data, with the DXY printing green for the third straight session and rising to highs last seen in Q2 2017. There was some profit-taking in afternoon trade, but the buck then continued to drift higher as conditions thinned out. Accordingly, and unsurprisingly, a fresh YTD low for the EUR was seen. A dovish Riksbank, which appears to have delayed its hiking timetable, sent EURSEK sharply higher. The Aussie edges lower after this week's weak CPI - analysts had been watching if it could remain above 0.7020-30 support, but instead it succumbed to the USD strength, which pushed it beneath 0.70. GBP struggles to remain above 1.29 ahead of next week's BOE and QIR, as Brexit news and a stronger USD weighs. Think-tank NIESR sees the BOE holding-off on rate hikes until August 2020, remaining patient amid a slowing global growth dynamic and uncertainties around Brexit; previously, the NIESR had seen a rate hike in mid-2019.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> Earlier in the week we pointed out how desks were arguing that the dovish pivot among major central banks was likely to add to the buck's strength. With USD hedging costs high (around 3% on the 3-month/annualised basis for EUR and JPY-based traders), unhedged Treasury buying may also be adding support to the USD (key is to watch indirect participation at US auctions, which was healthy on Wednesday, and although it slipped at today's 7s auction, was still above the last three auctions). And then there is tomorrow's Q1 GDP report to contend with, which analysts expect to see come in above 2.0%. It is worth paying attention to the FFR/IOER spread, which has stayed at the record 4bps wide for the fourth day, as chatter about tightening USD liquidity and funding issues (some have suggested from Asia) gains traction.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> With the market short of EUR and the single currency printing fresh YTD lows this week, consideration about what levels are attractive to add EUR longs is almost inevitable. SocGen, which argues the EUR is cheap, points out that although there are concerns about the health of the German economy (Wednesday's Ifo adds to that narrative - from an exports perspective at least), that might not necessarily mean the rest of the EZ will be weak. \"As manufacturing's share of Eurozone GDP falls, and as correlation between the industrial sector and broader economic activity decreases, the correlation between IFO, for example, and Eurozone GDP is weakening,\" SocGen says, \"maybe we place to much emphasis on PMIs and IFO in Europe.\" And if that is the case, the bank suggests that low for this cycle may not be very far from here.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Overnight the BOJ held rates as expected, provided specific forward guidance to keep \"extremely low rates\" throug Spring 2020. The bank trimmed its inflation view (by 0.1ppts to 1.3% Y/Y in 2019), and sees below-target inflation in 2021 (at 1.6% Y/Y). In hours, while the buck was punchy, it couldn't carve out gains against the yen, which was broadly stronger. A mixture of chunky option expiries (around 111.50) and the 200dma (also around 111.50) drew the price action towards the level, and we trade slightly above that going into Asia.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> The CBRT delivered a dovish hold today, removing the line from its statement that \"if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered\". The market received that very negatively since it reduces the CBRT's commitment to hiking rates again if need be, TD Securities said. \"Given the upwards pressure on USDTRY in recent weeks, we think that the removal of this pledge shows a remarkable degree of complacency and/or naivety on behalf of the CBRT.\" TD says that it maintains its bearish view on the lira, and sees USDTRY at 7.90 by end-Q2, and higher to 8.90 by end-Q3. \"We see the CBRT as being forced to hike further in the coming months, with a terminal WACF rate at around 30%.\"</p><p><strong>* SEK: </strong>Rates were held at -25bps, but the central bank narrowed the path for the repo rate by 11-17bps over the forecast horizon, with rate hikes pushed back from September to December or February 2020; the rate forecast for Q4 2020 was also revised lower to 23bps from 48bps. The Riksbank also reiterated it will reinvest proceeds from its bond-buying programme, and it expects to purchase bonds for SEK 45bln, which bank SEB says means that around 50% of the maturing bonds will be re-invested (plus coupons). Floden and Ohlsson made reservations against the decision to buy bonds from 2019 to 2020. \"The board still seems set to hiking rates towards the end of this year, but the lowered rate path highlights that inflation and economic developments remain very important,\" SEB writes, \"We stick with our call that the Riksbank will stay on hold this year with a first rate hike predicted in April next year.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Durable goods data was mixed, but some bank desks raised their trackers ahead of tomorrow's Q1 GDP print, suggesting that there might be some upside to the 2.1% consensus view for Q1. Some have noted that the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker was revised lower slightly after the data, but it is still worth pointing out that it was tracking zero growth at the beginning of the year, and now at 2.7%, suggests that the quarter was not as bad as had been feared in January, as risk sentiment soured, and the Fed subsequently pivoted dovish. Nevertheless, Treasury yields were flattish on Thursday, with a slight bias towards higher. The US sold 7yr paper in an average auction; a tail of 0.5bps bucks this week's trend of 'on the screws' auctions; the indirect bid was eyed after the decent performance at the 5s auction on Wednesday, and although it slipped slightly, it was still slightly better than the three auction average -- some have speculated that high US hedging costs could see foreign bidders participate in US auctions unhedged, which might provide support for the buck. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, but not significant.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>King USD continues to reign ahead of Friday's Q1 GDP data, with the DXY printing green for the third straight session, and rising to highs last seen in Q2 2017. There was some profit-taking in afternoon trade, but the buck then continued to drift higher as conditions thinned out. Accordingly and unsurprisingly, a fresh YTD low for the EUR was seen. A dovish Riksbank, which appears to have delayed its hiking timetable, sent EURSEK sharply higher. The Aussie edges lower after this week's weak CPI - analysts had been watching if it could remain above 0.7020-30 support, but instead it succumbed to the USD strength, which pushed it beneath 0.70. GBP struggles to remain above 1.29 ahead of next week's BOE and QIR, as Brexit news and a stronger USD weighs. Think-tank NIESR sees the BOE holding-off on rate hikes until August 2020, remaining patient amid a slowing global growth dynamic and uncertainties around Brexit; previously, the NIESR had seen a rate hike in mid-2019.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>Earlier in the week we pointed out how desks were arguing that the dovish pivot among major central banks was likely to add to the buck's strength. With USD hedging costs high (around 3% on the 3-month/annualised basis for EUR and JPY-based traders), unhedged Treasury buying may also be adding support to the USD (key is to watch indirect participation at US auctions, which was healthy on Wednesday, and although it slipped at today's 7s auction, was still abov ethe last three auctions). And then there is tomorrow's Q1 GDP report to contend with, which analysts expect to see come in above 2.0%. It is worth paying attention to the FFR/IOER spread, which has stayed at the record 4bps wide for the fourth day, as chatter about tightening USD liquidity and funding issues (some have suggested from Asia) gains traction.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>With the market short of EUR and the single currency printing fresh YTD lows this week, consideration about what levels are attractive to add EUR longs is almost inevitable. SocGen, which argues the EUR is cheap, points out that although there are concerns about the health of the German economy (Wednesday's Ifo adds to that narrative - from an exports perspective at least), that might not necessarily mean the rest of the EZ will be weak. \"As manufacturing's share of Eurozone GDP falls, and as correlation between the industrial sector and broader economic activity decreases, the correlation between IFO, for example, and Eurozone GDP is weakening,\" SocGen says, \"maybe we place to much emphasis on PMIs and IFO in Europe.\" And if that is the case, the bank suggests that low for this cycle may not be very far from here.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Overnight the BOJ held rates as expected, provided specific forward guidance to keep \"extremely low rates\" throug Spring 2020. The bank trimmed its inflation view (by 0.1ppts to 1.3% Y/Y in 2019), and sees below-target inflation in 2021 (at 1.6% Y/Y). In hours, while the buck was punchy, it couldn't carve out gains against the yen, which was broadly stronger. A mixture of chunky option expiries (around 111.50) and the 200dma (also around 111.50) drew the price action towards the level, and we trade slightly above that going into Asia. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The CBRT delivered a dovish hold today, removing the line from its statement that \"if needed, further monetary tightening willbe delivered\". The market received that very negatively since it reduces the CBRT's commitment to hiking rates again if need be, TD Securities said. \"Given the upwards pressure on USDTRY in recent weeks, we think that the removal of this pledge shows a remarkable degree of complacency and/or naivety on behalf of the CBRT.\" TD says that it maintains its bearish view on the lira, and sees USDTRY at 7.90 by end-Q2, and higher to 8.90 by end-Q3. \"We see the CBRT as being forced to hike further in the coming months, with a terminal WACF rate at around 30%.\"</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The crude complex traded choppy before finishing lower on Thursday, with Brent making new YTD highs during the day, as concerns grew regarding how the US’s recently announced end to Iranian crude import waivers will impact supply. The halting of crude oil loadings from Russia’s Ust-Luga port on concerns of contamination only added to the bullish sentiment. WTI failed to rally to the same extent amid the overhang of this week’s bearish Inventory data; as well as US officials reaffirming their commitment to working with partners to ensure sufficient supply. However, WTI continues to trade at near YTD highs, with UBS noting that the market continues to focus on the supply/demand outlook and geopolitical tensions. Citi analysts note that, despite US assurances, it is hard to argue that a substantial reduction in Iranian exports will not translate into higher oil prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong>&nbsp;The US Treasury will auction USD 133bln in 2-year (USD 40bln, Tuesday), 5-year (USD 41bln, Wednesday), 7-year (USD 32bln, Thursday), as well as a 2yr FRN (USD 20bln, Wednesday); with USD 107.2bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise a net USD 25.8bln in new cash. The Fed will allow USD 29.8bln to run off its balance sheet at month-end, and will add on a modest USD 0.6bln to 2s and 5s, USD 0.5bln to 7s, and USD 0.3bln to the FRNs.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> Analysts at Societe Generale say the 7-year sector appears fair versus 5s and 10s, and is also trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The bank also notes that the WI for the 7-year yield trades above the previous stop-out rate, which is a positive for the auction. Additionally, dealer positioning seems elevated in the sector (highest in four weeks) and that could be a negative going into the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral bias.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/c4ecb7a5-ef80-4697-8399-e344c2cfcbe4.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>TRY/SEK</strong></p><p>The latest victims of more dovish than expected respective Central Bank policy twists, as the CBRT followed the BoC yesterday by removing a pledge to hike further if necessary even though it acknowledged upward risks to inflation and pledged to keep its current tight stance intact until such time that the price outlook has improved significantly. Usd/Try shot up from around 5.0900 ahead of the meeting to almost 5.9800 at one stage and through tech resistance, in similar vein to Usd/Sek and Eur/Sek following the earlier Riksbank pronouncements that included a later and flatter repo tightening trajectory plus QE at a nominal Sek45 bn pace to start from H2 (when the next 25 bp rise in rates was signalled) and run through to the end of next year. Eur/Sek currently around 10.6325 vs just over 10.6650 at the high as banks adjust their forecasts to align with new guidance from September to December 2019 or April 2020, and even no further normalisation at all in the current cycle.</p><p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar has lost a bit of bullish momentum, but not before chalking up fresh yearly or even longer highs against many currency peers within the G10 sphere and globally, as noted above. Indeed, the index clocked another new ytd peak at 98.337 amidst all round gains and remains ‘comfortably’ above the 98.000 marker ahead of US GDP data tomorrow and post-contrasting durable goods vs initial claims.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>The Yen has been bucking the overall trend for a while on the premise or guise that the forthcoming longer than usual Golden Week break may be skewing flows in favour of the Jpy, while a conditionally more dovish BoJ via specific rate guidance hardly impacted. However, Usd/Jpy continued its retreat from Wednesday’s new 2019 highs (circa 112.40) towards 111.50 and the 200 DMA alongside the top of mega option expiries extending down to 111.40 (3 bn altogether). The Kiwi also staged a firm rebound vs the Greenback after sliding in sympathy with the Aussie to sub-0.6600 as <strong>AUD/</strong>Usd fell a bit deeper below and nearly threatened stops said to be sitting at 0.6980. However, Nzd/Usd is now back up around 0.6625 and could be bracing for NZ trade later.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>All benefiting from the aforementioned Usd downturn as the single currency held in just above some pre-1.1100 tech support levels and the Loonie drew encouragement from the fact that it contained earlier losses through 1.3500 well off yesterday’s lows, like the Franc that has returned to test 1.0200 resistance. Meanwhile, the Pound managed to revisit 1.2900 after a brief decline through Fib and MA levels under the big figure.</p>",

In addition, holiday closures in Australia and New Zealand, the BoJ policy announcement, weak South Korean GDP and a slew of earnings provided much for participants to ponder over</strong>. <strong>Nikkei</strong> <strong>225</strong> (+0.5%) traded higher with newsflow and the biggest gaining stocks in Japan dominated by corporate results, while <strong>KOSPI</strong> (-0.5%) was subdued following abysmal growth data for Q1 in which GDP Q/Q unexpectedly contracted by 0.3% which was the worst reading since Q4 2008 and GDP Y/Y expanded at the slowest pace in almost a decade. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang</strong> <strong>Seng</strong> (-0.8%) and <strong>Shanghai</strong> <strong>Comp</strong>. (-2.5%) were downbeat as earnings season also started to pick up in the region and after the PBoC refrained again from liquidity operations which resulted to a net CNY 80bln drain. In addition, there were state media reports the PBoC will set up policy framework to implement relatively low RRR for small and medium banks, although this failed to spur a recovery given the absence of an actual RRR cut announcement and as PBoC officials reaffirmed a preference for prudent monetary policy. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy amid the cautious risk sentiment in the region and after the BoJ policy announcement which initially lifted 10yr JGBs at the open due to the dovish aspects from the statement and downgrades in the Outlook Report. However, prices then returned to pre-announcement levels as the lower projections were not much of a surprise given the recent data, while the BoJ slightly adjusted its modified forward guidance in which it stated that it will keep very low interest rate levels for an extended period of time at least through around Spring 2020.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 80bln.

BoJ also stated that it will take longer than intended to achieve 2% target and that both risks to economic and price outlooks are skewed to the downside, while it noted it will relax terms and conditions for securities lending as well as consider introduction of ETF lending facility. In terms of the Outlook Report, the BoJ lowered its forecasts for Real GDP in FY19 and FY20 as well as Core CPI forecast for FY20.

This morning’s downturn is on the back of significant underperformance in a number of Co’s after a morning driven by earnings with Nokia (-10.0%) leading the losses at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. reported a EUR 50mln operating loss vs. Exp. profit of EUR 305mln. Separately, Sainsbury’s (-5.3%) are down after the CMA confirmed that they are to block merger discussions with Asda; as such the Co. are at the bottom of the FTSE 100 (-0.4%). The FTSE 100 is also weighed on by Barclays (-1.5%) post earnings where they reported a CIB total income which was lower than the prior, and Taylor Wimpey (-4.0%) after the Co. stated that increasing build costs are to push margins slightly lower. In recent reports Commerzbank (-2.0%) and Deutsche Bank (+3.0%) have confirmed that they have discontinued merger talks, as they believe that the merger would not result in sufficient benefits; which does follow earlier source reports that talks between the Co’s were on the verge of collapsing. Regarding this morning more positive earnings, ASM (+7.2%) lead the Stoxx 600 after beating on Q1 revenue and operating profit; while, Bayer (+3.5%) top the Stoxx 50 after confirming their FY guidance.</p><p>There were mixed fortunes for the post-market earnings yesterday from the NASDAQ heavyweights Microsoft, Facebook, and Tesla. The former two companies were inspiring on a top and bottom line basis, both beating quite substantially on EPS, with MSFT also exceeding expectations on revenue, whilst FB came in in-line (<strong>Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Q3 EPS USD 1.14 vs. exp. USD 1.00, revenue USD 30.6bln vs. exp. USD 29.84bln &amp; Facebook Inc (FB) Q1 Adj EPS USD 1.89 vs. exp. USD 1.63, adj revenue USD 14.91bln vs. exp. USD 14.97bln</strong>). The components were also tailwinds, with daily and monthly average users increasing by 8% for the social media giant, and cloud services revenue jumping 22% for the Windows maker. Similar positivity could not be found for Musk’s Tesla, who had a wider EPS loss than expected, with revenues missing by over USD 600mln, however, the foul earnings could be cleaned up slightly by a reaffirmation of 2019 deliveries guidance, Model 3 production rising 3% QQ, and a cited expectation to return to profit in Q3. <strong>(Tesla (TSLA) Q1 Non-GAAP loss per share USD 2.90 vs. Exp. loss USD 0.69, rev. USD 4.54bln vs. Exp. USD 5.33bln)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>SEK - A technical break below support in Eur/Sek and brief look at the 10.5000 proved fundamentally flawed or just premature as the cross catapulted more than 15 big figures on a much more dovish than expected Riksbank policy meeting outturn, while Usd/Sek hit its highest levels in some 16 years. In short, the Swedish Central Bank pushed back the likely timing for further rate normalisation to year end or early 2020 from H2 this year and lowered its repo path over the forecast horizon, adding that the current -0.25% level will be maintained for longer than previously anticipated (ie as flagged in February). The Riksbank also predicted softer inflation in light of recent weaker than expected price developments and announced that Sek45 bn SGBs will be bought from July 2019 through December 2020 regardless of a couple of reservations. Eur/Sek has eased back from a circa 10.6655 peak, but remains relatively close to chart resistance around 10.6730 and Usd/Sek is now eyeing 9.6000 as the Dollar continues to rally across the board.</p><p>USD - The Greenback is still outperforming or gaining at the expense of its currency counterparts, as the DXY consolidates and builds on advances through 98.000. In truth, aside from the Swedish Crown’s post-Riksbank collapse the Buck breached key levels late yesterday as resilience in several rivals finally gave way and the index cleared resistance ahead of the round number to register a new ytd best at 98.189, with only a relatively minor extension to 98.233 so far today. However, the DXY remains in the ascendency and 98.496 is the next bullish chart target.</p><p>CAD/GBP/EUR/AUD - All weaker vs the Usd, albeit just off worst levels, as the Loonie continues to reflect on Wednesday’s shift from the BoC to a wait-and-see stance vs tightening previously and fails to derive much support from a rebound in oil prices. Meanwhile, Cable has fallen under 1.2900 to test Fib and MA supports, with Eur/Usd probing below its latest 2019 trough to 1.1135 and eyeing downside chart levels ahead of 1.1100 (1.1190-10), Aud/Usd pivoting 0.7000 where hefty option barriers lie and the Franc back to straddling 1.0200.</p><p>JPY/NZD - The Yen has recovered well from new ytd lows vs the Usd around 112.40 to trade back above 112.00 amidst more speculation about positioning for the upcoming lengthy Golden Week holiday and not really reacting to the BoJ’s attempt to clarify policy guidance given Governor Kuroda’s admission that it is highly possible that ultra accommodation may continue beyond Spring 2020 as the 2% inflation target could well remain elusive even after FY 2021. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is trying to cling to 0.6600 vs its US peer ahead of NZ trade data and with some indirect help via the Aud/Nzd cross that is hovering near the base of a 1.0627-42 range at the tail end of ANZAC day.</p><p>EM - Another day and another rise in Usd/Try, to circa 5.9000 awaiting the CBRT to see if hawkish words can be as effective as actions.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>It’s minimal, but UK debt has regrouped and recouped a bit more of its earlier losses to post a new 127.55 intraday high vs 127.30 at one stage, in contrast to Sterling that is testing fresh lows vs the outperforming Dollar with Cable down through tech support just under 1.2900 and the DXY nudging slightly loftier 2019 highs (98.276). Not even a significant beat on CBI retail sales has impacted, as Short Sterling contracts also stage a comeback to trade 2 ticks ahead vs 1 adrift. Meanwhile, Bunds have slipped back from a marginal Eurex intraday peak of 165.80 and US Treasuries have pared overnight gains with the curve flipping back to steeper, albeit fractional ahead of durable goods, weekly claims and the 7 year auction.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (+1.0%) and WTI (+0.4%) prices are in the green as oil prices have now largely shrugged off yesterday’s larger than expected EIA build; which came in at 5.479M vs. Exp. 1.25mln, as this was below Tuesday’s API build of 6.86M. This morning Brent prices did surpass, and remain above, the USD 75/bbl level for the first time in 2019.

        "content": "<p><strong>SEK</strong></p><p>A technical break below support in Eur/Sek and brief look at the 10.5000 proved fundamentally flawed or just premature as the cross catapulted more than 15 big figures on a much more dovish than expected Riksbank policy meeting outturn, while Usd/Sek hit its highest levels in some 16 years. In short, the Swedish Central Bank pushed back the likely timing for further rate normalisation to year end or early 2020 from H2 this year and lowered its repo path over the forecast horizon, adding that the current -0.25% level will be maintained for longer than previously anticipated (ie as flagged in February). The Riksbank also predicted softer inflation in light of recent weaker than expected price developments and announced that Sek45 bn SGBs will be bought from July 2019 through December 2020 regardless of a couple of reservations. Eur/Sek has eased back from a circa 10.6655 peak, but remains relatively close to chart resistance around 10.6730 and Usd/Sek is now eyeing 9.6000 as the Dollar continues to rally across the board.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Greenback is still outperforming or gaining at the expense of its currency counterparts, as the <strong>DXY </strong>consolidates and builds on advances through 98.000. In truth, aside from the Swedish Crown’s post-Riksbank collapse the Buck breached key levels late yesterday as resilience in several rivals finally gave way and the index cleared resistance ahead of the round number to register a new ytd best at 98.189, with only a relatively minor extension to 98.233 so far today. However, the DXY remains in the ascendency and 98.496 is the next bullish chart target.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/EUR/AUD</strong></p><p>All weaker vs the Usd, albeit just off worst levels, as the Loonie continues to reflect on Wednesday’s shift from the BoC to a wait-and-see stance vs tightening previously and fails to derive much support from a rebound in oil prices. Meanwhile, Cable has fallen under 1.2900 to test Fib and MA supports, with Eur/Usd probing below its latest 2019 trough to 1.1135 and eyeing downside chart levels ahead of 1.1100 (1.1190-10), Aud/Usd pivoting 0.7000 where hefty option barriers lie and the Franc back to straddling 1.0200.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>The Yen has recovered well from new ytd lows vs the Usd around 112.40 to trade back above 112.00 amidst more speculation about positioning for the upcoming lengthy Golden Week holiday and not really reacting to the BoJ’s attempt to clarify policy guidance given Governor Kuroda’s admission that it is highly possible that ultra accommodation may continue beyond Spring 2020 as the 2% inflation target could well remain elusive even after FY 2021. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is trying to cling to 0.6600 vs its US peer ahead of NZ trade data and with some indirect help via the Aud/Nzd cross that is hovering near the base of a 1.0627-42 range at the tail end of ANZAC day.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another day and another rise in Usd/Try, to circa 5.9000 awaiting the CBRT to see if hawkish words can be as effective as actions.</p>",

In addition, holiday closures in Australia and New Zealand, the BoJ policy announcement, weak South Korean GDP and a slew of earnings provided much for participants to ponder over. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.6%)</strong> traded higher with price action dominated by corporate results, while <strong>KOSPI (-0.4%)</strong> was subdued following abysmal growth data for Q1 in which GDP Q/Q unexpectedly contracted by 0.3% which was the worst reading since Q4 2008 and GDP Y/Y expanded at the slowest pace in almost a decade. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.1%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%)</strong> were downbeat as earnings season also started to pick up in the region and after the PBoC refrained again from liquidity operations which resulted to a net CNY 80bln drain. In addition, there were state media reports the PBoC will set up policy framework to implement relatively low RRR for small and medium banks, although this failed to spur a recovery given the absence of an actual RRR cut announcement and as PBoC officials reaffirmed a preference for prudent monetary policy. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy amid the cautious risk sentiment in the region and after the BoJ policy announcement which initially lifted 10yr JGBs at the open due to the dovish aspects from the statement and downgrades in the Outlook Report. However, prices then returned to pre-announcement levels as the lower projections were not much of a surprise given the recent data, while the BoJ slightly adjusted its modified forward guidance in which it stated that it will keep very low interest rate levels for an extended period of time at least through around Spring 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 80bln.

In terms of the Outlook Report, the <strong>BoJ lowered its forecasts for Real GDP in FY19 and FY20 as well as Core CPI forecast for FY20</strong>.

(Sky News) This news came after the 1922 Executive Committee rejected the leadership rule change but reportedly want a clearer timetable for PM May's departure, according to Sky's Beth Rigby. (Twitter)</p><p>FX</p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> held on to the most the prior day’s gains after having rallied to above 98.00 and its best levels since Q2 2017 amid recent weakness across its major counterparts including <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which slipped below 1.1200 in the aftermath of weaker than expected German IFO data. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also succumbed to the broad USD strength and briefly retreated to a 1.2800 handle, despite some relief for UK PM May after the 1922 Executive Committee rejected the leadership rule change but were said to want a clearer timetable for PM May's departure, while recent reports suggested PM May plans a Withdrawal Agreement Bill vote for as early as next week. <strong>CAD</strong> remained weak after the BoC removed its reference to future rate hikes at yesterday’s policy statement, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were kept subdued amid holiday closures for ANZAC Day and on increased expectations for an RBA rate cut next month in which ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures priced in a 67% chance of a 25bps cut at the next meeting vs. 13% prior to the CPI miss. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was indecisive due to the mixed risk tone and as the BoJ announcement proved to be a non-event, while KRW weakened to its lowest since 2017 due to the GDP miss which spurred speculation of FX intervention to stem the losses for the currency.</p><p><strong>BoC Governor Poloz said there would be a discussion whether the BoC would cut rates or not if there was a negative disturbance</strong> while he noted conflicts in data with GDP positive and labour market releases less impressive. Poloz also said setting of rates will give us positive outlook and that growth will pick up in Q2 as well as improve further in Q3, while he suggested that will be <strong>no rush to start hiking again if everything turns out perfectly and that BoC should take time to look at data</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities traded mostly sideways amid the cautious risk tone in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures were rangebound back below the USD 66.00/bbl level following yesterday’s larger then expected build in headline DoE inventories, while there were comments from Iran’s foreign minister which suggested confidence in eluding US sanctions. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> price action was restricted as the greenback held on to the majority of its recent gains, while the cautious risk tone also stalled <strong>copper</strong> overnight.</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>Iran Foreign Minister Zarif said US Navy ships can pass through Strait of Hormuz and stressed commitment to freedom of navigation, while he suggested confidence Iran can evade US sanctions and that they 'have a PHD in that area'. Furthermore, Zarif said the US blacklisting of Iran's Revolutionary Guard is absurd but Iran will exercise prudence. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>North Korea warned of a response to US-South Korea drills, while there were also reports that North Korea leader Kim removed Kim Yong Chol as head of United Front Department which overseas foreign ties as he blames Kim Yong Chol for the failed summit with US in Vietnam. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>US</p><p>Treasuries rallied on Wednesday, stoked by a soft Aussie CPI report overnight, while there was chatter that some of the buying was a result of real money accounts adding longs ahead of Japan’s Golden Week holiday. Weak IFO helped the complex. A large block buy in the five year space helped the rally continue in US hours, though the T-Note has been horizontal since late morning trade. The 5-year auction was decent, stopping on the screws (as did yesterday’s sale of 2s), though today’s auction internals were far more encouraging, with indirect participation rising, and cover slightly higher. The US Treasury will top off the week’s supply tomorrow with a sale of 7s: analysts at Societe Generale say the 7-year sector appears fair versus 5s and 10s, and is also trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The bank also notes that the WI for the 7-year yield trades above the previous stop-out rate, which is a positive for the auction. Additionally, dealer positioning seems elevated in the sector (highest in four weeks) and that could be a negative going into the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral bias. At settlement, major curve spreads were relatively unchanged. US T-note futures (M9) settled 13 ticks higher at 123-17.</p><p>NEC Director Kudlow said we will nominate Stephen Moore to the Fed if he passes the FBI vetting process. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin cautious following an uninspiring lead from Wall St where the major indices consolidated albeit near record levels. In addition, holiday closures in Australia and New Zealand, the impending BoJ policy announcement, weak South Korean GDP and a slew of earnings have provided much for participants to ponder. Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) trades marginally higher with newsflow in Japan and the biggest gaining stocks dominated by corporate results, while KOSPI (-0.2%) is subdued following abysmal growth data for Q1 in which GDP Q/Q unexpectedly contracted by 0.3% which was the worst reading since Q4 2008 and GDP Y/Y expanded at the slowest pace in almost a decade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) are downbeat as earnings season also starts to pick up in the region and after the PBoC refrained again from liquidity operations which resulted to a net CNY 80bln drain.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds on to the most the prior day’s gains after having rallied to above 98.00 and its best levels since Q2 2017 amid recent weakness across its major counterparts including EUR/USD which slipped below 1.1200 in the aftermath of weaker than expected German IFO data. GBP/USD also succumbed to the broad USD strength and briefly retreated to a 1.2800 handle, despite some relief for UK PM May after the 1922 Executive Committee rejected the leadership rule change but were said to want a clearer timetable for PM May's departure, while recent reports have also suggested PM May plans a Withdrawal Agreement Bill vote for as early as next week. CAD also remains weak after the BoC removed its reference to future rate hikes at yesterday’s policy statement, while antipodeans are subdued amid holiday closures for ANZAC Day and on increased expectations for an RBA rate cut next month in which ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures priced in a 67% chance of a 25bps cut at the next meeting vs. 13% prior to the CPI miss. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is indecisive due to the mixed risk tone amid the looming BoJ announcement and KRW weakened to its lowest since 2017 due to the GDP miss which also spurred speculation of FX intervention to stem the losses for the currency.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are choppy on the cautious risk sentiment and with participants sidelined ahead of the BoJ.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan is to conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Thursday in which it is widely expected to maintain QQE with yield curve control policy and negative interest rates at -0.10%. Consensus is also one-sided for the BoJ to keep a flexible approach regarding its long-term yield target at around 0.0% and reaffirm forward guidance of keeping current extremely low rates for an extended period of time, while the central bank will also release board members' latest Real GDP and Core CPI forecasts in the Outlook Report.</p><p>The rhetoric from officials have mostly been a rehash of prior statements which supports the view for no policy changes as BoJ Governor Kuroda reiterated the need to continue easing persistently and that it will take time to hit the inflation goal. Kuroda also repeated the view that the economy is to continue its moderate expansion with momentum in place to reach 2% target and although&nbsp;he stated there is still scope to further ease monetary policy including a rate cut if needed, he added a caveat that the negative impact on banks’ profits must be considered. Deputy Governor Amamiya has also affirmed the BoJ are prepared to offer ample fund supply in the event of a financial crisis, which points to the unlikelihood of policy adjustments in the foreseeable future unless there is a shock to the economy which warrants such action.</p><p>In terms of the data since the last meeting, March headline CPI Y/Y increased to 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.2%) and Core CPI topped estimates at 0.8% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.7%), although both remained below the halfway point of the BoJ’s 2% price target. Conversely, the latest Industrial Production data fell 1.1% Y/Y (Prev. +0.3%) and Exports in March contracted further albeit at a narrower than expected pace of -2.4% vs. Exp. -2.7% (Prev. -1.2%), while the Tankan survey for Q1 mostly disappointed with the headline Large Manufacturing Index at a 2-year low of 12 vs. Exp. 14.0 (Prev. 19.0) but Large All Industry Capex surprised to upside at 1.2% vs. Exp. -0.4% (Prev. 14.3%).</p><p>Nonetheless, the mostly softer economic releases are not expected to prompt BoJ action at this meeting although could impact board members’ forecasts for the Outlook Report. In addition, policy loosening is also seen to be premature given the uncertainty from the US-China trade dispute and global growth concerns, while factors closer to home such as US-Japan trade talks and the looming sales tax increase scheduled for October also favour a wait-and-see approach by the central bank.</p><p>As usual, there is no exact scheduled time for the BoJ announcement which can occur anytime after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT. Focus will also be on the Monetary Policy Statement and Outlook Report which will include the first expectations for FY 2021, while sources have suggested FY19 growth and inflation forecast could be cut and that FY21 inflation will be projected above 1.5% but fall short of the 2% target.</p><p>Previous Outlook Report</p><p>Real GDP</p><ul><li>Fiscal 2018 forecast at 0.9%</li><li>Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.9%.</li><li>Fiscal 2020 forecast at 1.0%.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Core CPI</p><ul><li>Fiscal 2018 forecast at 0.8%.</li><li>Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.9% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</li><li>Fiscal 2020 forecast at 1.4% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</li></ul>",
