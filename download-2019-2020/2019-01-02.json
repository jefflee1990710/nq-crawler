At an earlier briefing, when asked if he would accept a government funding deal with less than USD 5bln for a wall, he said that the figure is a very small amount and warned that the government could be shut for a long time, as long as necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump was upbeat on this front and stated that trade negotiations with China are coming along very well and &ldquo;we&#39;ll see what happens&rdquo;; he warned that there was a glitch in the stock market last month, but it has a long way to go and will go up once trade deals are settled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI SETTLES $1.13 HIGHER AT $46.54/BBL; BRENT FUTURES SETTLE $1.11 HIGHER AT $54.91/BBL. </strong>Crude was on the back foot in early trade, taking its cue from softer equities and a stronger dollar; traders cited soft PMI data out of the world&#39;s second largest economy China. Equities found some stabilisation after the open, and pared losses, helping support crude. Traders also pointed to news that Saudi Arabia was cutting its exports in December, as it pledged, which offset news that Russian oil production hit a fresh Soviet-era high, while Iraq total exports were up in December from November levels, and additionally, data also showed Nigerian crude output rose to 2.09mln BPD in December from 1.86mln BPD in 2017. &quot;When the market was on the defensive, some newswire headlines referenced &#39;surging supply&#39; although early estimates of OPEC production for December suggest an overall decline, with ECB Energy putting the drop at 870,000 bpd to 32.43mln BPD,&quot; Citi said. &quot;Over the intermediate term, we see potential for confirmation that OPEC+ producers are making good on their commitments to reduce output to support both an increase in managed money long positions and a recovery in prices in the weeks and months ahead,&quot; the bank added. NOTE: The API will report its weekly energy inventory data after the bell on Thursday, ahead of the DOE&#39;s release on Friday; expectations are for headline crude to draw by 2.3mln, distillates to build by 2.6mln, gasoline to build by 2.3mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +0.12% at 2509, NDX +0.49% at 6360, DJI +0.08% at 23345. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +2.07%, Materials +0.46%, Industrials +0.44%, Cons Discretionary +0.93%, Cons Staples -0.43%, Healthcare -1.35%, Financials +0.74%, Tech +0.07%, Telecoms +1.25%, Utilities -1.77%. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) sank after reporting worse than expected Q4 deliveries and announcing price cuts on all its models amid a loss in green tax credit. Hologic (HOLX) and Abbot (ABT) were also down following downgrades at Morgan Stanley and Citi, respectively. On the flip side, General Electric (GE) posted gains, and was a top gainer in the SPX, with William Bair analysts attributing the upside to renewed interest from investors who sold the stock amid a tax loss back in November. Casino names, of the likes of Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts (MGM), also held in positive territory after Macau reported strong December revenue. Activision (ATVI) reversed course and turned positive for the session after ex-CEO Neumann was officially named Netflix (NFLX) CFO, succeeding David Wells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H19) SETTLE 5+ HIGHER AT 122-06. </strong>The Treasury complex was bid overnight after a soft Chinese m manufacturing PMI report gave further fuel to the notion of slowing economic momentum, while mixed European PMIs did little to change that dynamic. However, some selling emerged after US equities stabilised after the open, and the risk mood became more constructive. By the close, the short-end of the curve was a touch negative, while longer-dated yields were lower by around 5bps; the result was a flatter yield curve on the first trading day of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>the index kicked off the EU session on the backfoot with losses of around 0.3% and below the 96.00 level though as the session progressed, USD made a resurgence against its peers (ex-JPY) as losses in European equities accelerated following the cash open; DXY reclaimed 96.00 to the upside before taking out 96.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> out-muscling the greenback during Asia-Pac trade as USD/JPY hit a 7-month low and temporarily sat on a 108 handle. JPY strength was largely driven by the broader risk environment as disappointing Chinese data overnight and the ongoing US government shutdown remain a key focus for investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>fell victim to the recovery in the USD (after testing 1.1500 to the upside during Asia-Pac trade) as the pair slipped below 1.1450 with some analysts also suggesting EUR/JPY selling as a potential catalyst for the move. As the USD garnered further traction, the pair eventually collapsed below 1.1400 to reach a daily low of 1.1331 in a session that was relatively void of EZ macro updates with in-line core Eurozone PMIs unable to spur price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable began the session on the backfoot and slipped back below 1.2700 despite a high print of 1.2774 seen during Asia-Pac hours. Brexit-related commentary has been relatively light thus far with Parliament not returning from their winter break until 7th Jan. As such, the most interesting development for UK assets today has been the latest manufacturing PMI print which came in at 54.2 vs. Exp. 52.5 (Prev. 53.1). Cable briefly reclaimed 1.2700 to the upside before reversing gains with a pick-up in new orders largely attributed to stock-piling ahead of Brexit. GBP/USD temporarily slipped below 1.2600 to reach two-week lows but stated clear of Dec 17th lows of 1.2552.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>fell victim to the disappointing Chinese data overnight which saw Caixin mfg PMI slip into contractionary territory for the first time in 19 months. Losses were also spurred on by the aforementioned pick-up in USD. The pair initially proved to be relatively resilient to holding onto its status on a 0.7000 handle with option-related bids ahead of the key level said to have stopped the rot in the pair. However, as was the case with the broader G10 FX complex (ex-JPY), the antipodean eventually gave way to the firmer USD.</p>\r\n",

Equities found some stabilisation after the open, and pared losses, helping support crude. Traders also pointed to news that Saudi Arabia was cutting its exports in December, as it pledged, which offset news that Russian oil production hit a fresh Soviet-era high, while Iraq total exports were up in December from November levels, and additionally, data also showed Nigerian crude output rose to 2.09mln BPD in December from 1.86mln BPD in 2017. &quot;When the market was on the defensive, some newswire headlines referenced &#39;surging supply&#39; although early estimates of OPEC production for December suggest an overall decline, with ECB Energy putting the drop at 870,000 bpd to 32.43mln BPD,&quot; Citi said. &quot;Over the intermediate term, we see potential for confirmation that OPEC+ producers are making good on their commitments to reduce output to support both an increase in managed money long positions and a recovery in prices in the weeks and months ahead,&quot; the bank added. NOTE: The API will report its weekly energy inventory data after the bell on Thursday, ahead of the DOE&#39;s release on Friday.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY kicked off the EU session on the backfoot with losses of around 0.3% and below the 96.00 level with JPY out-muscling the greenback during Asia-Pac trade as USD/JPY hit a 7-month low and temporarily sat on a 108 handle. JPY strength was largely driven by the broader risk environment as disappointing Chinese data overnight and the ongoing US government shutdown remain a key focus for investors with President Trump set to meet with Congressional leaders at 2000GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the European session progressed, USD made a resurgence against its peers (ex-JPY) as losses in European equities accelerated following the cash open; DXY reclaimed 96.00 to the upside before taking out 96.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/USD fell victim to the recovery in the USD (after testing 1.1500 to the upside during Asia-Pac trade) as the pair slipped below 1.1450 with some analysts also suggesting EUR/JPY selling as a potential catalyst for the move. As the USD garnered further traction, the pair eventually collapsed below 1.1400 to reach a daily low of 1.1352 in a session that was relatively void of EZ macro updates with in-line core Eurozone PMIs unable to spur price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For GBP/USD, the pair began the session on the backfoot and slipped back below 1.2700 despite a high print of 1.2774 seen during Asia-Pac hours. Brexit-related commentary has been relatively light thus far with Parliament not returning from their winter break until 7th Jan. As such, the most interesting development for UK assets today has been the latest manufacturing PMI print which came in at 54.2 vs. Exp. 52.5 (Prev. 53.1). Cable briefly reclaimed 1.2700 to the upside before reversing gains with a pick-up in new orders largely attributed to stock-piling ahead of Brexit. GBP/USD temporarily slipped below 1.2600 to reach two-week lows but stated clear of Dec 17th lows of 1.2552.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, AUD/USD fell victim to the disappointing Chinese data overnight which saw Caixin mfg PMI slip into contractionary territory for the first time in 19 months. Losses were also spurred on by the aforementioned pick-up in USD. The pair initially proved to be relatively resilient to holding onto its status on a 0.7000 handle with option-related bids ahead of the key level said to have stopped the rot in the pair. However, as was the case with the broader G10 FX complex (ex-JPY), the antipodean eventually gave way to the firmer USD.</p>\r\n",

(Politico) This came after reports on Monday that US House Democrats are to introduce a bill later this week with USD 1.3bln for border security to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb 8th. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has stated that he is willing to meet US President Trump at any time but would take an alternative path if the US keeps sanctions on the nation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European Indices [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.4%] are in the red following on from the poor performance seen in Aisa. (Of note the SMI remains closed due to Berchtold&rsquo;s day). The CAC (-1.4%) is underperforming its peers with index heavyweight Renault (-3.2%) towards the bottom of the index as the Co&rsquo;s Renault-Samsung Motors division reported a significant decrease in year-on-year sales for December; in addition, the political situation remains fraught in France. Sectors are also in the red, with some underperformance seen in materials and energy names due to Chinese Manufacturing PMI showing a contraction, and oil prices in the red due to continued oversupply concerns respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY entered the EU session on the backfoot with losses of around 0.3% and below the 96.00 level with JPY out-muscling the greenback during Asia-Pac trade as USD/JPY hit a 7-month low. JPY strength was largely driven by the broader risk environment as disappointing Chinese data overnight and the ongoing US government shutdown remain a key focus for investors. As the European session progressed, USD made a resurgence against its peers (ex-JPY) as losses in European equities accelerated following the cash open; DXY reclaimed 96.00 to the upside and trades relatively unchanged. EUR/USD eventually fell victim to the recovery in the USD (after testing 1.1500 to the upside during Asia-Pac trade) as the pair slipped below 1.1450 with some analysts also suggesting EUR/JPY selling as a potential catalyst for the move. As such, the pair has drifted towards 675mln of option expiries between 1.1452-30 with this morning&rsquo;s PMI metrics from the Eurozone unable to spur much in the way of noteworthy price action with core readings unrevised from their prior&rsquo;s. For GBP/USD, the pair began the session on the backfoot and slipped back below 1.2700 despite a high print of 1.2774 seen during Asia-Pac hours. Brexit-related commentary has been relatively light thus far with Parliament not returning from their winter break until 7th Jan. As such, the most interesting development for UK assets today has been the latest manufacturing PMI print which came in at 54.2 vs. Exp. 52.5 (Prev. 53.1). Cable briefly reclaimed 1.2700 to the upside before reversing gains with a pick-up in new orders largely attributed to stock-piling ahead of Brexit. Elsewhere, AUD/USD fell victim to the disappointing Chinese data overnight which saw Caixin mfg PMI slip into contractionary territory for the first time in 19 months. Losses were also spurred on by the aforementioned pick-up in USD, however, the pair maintains its status on a 0.7000 handle with option-related bids ahead of the key level said to have stopped the rot in the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt has derived little inspiration from the raft of European Manufacturing PMI data and continues to trade with a risk-off tone with both Gilt and Bunds continue the rise seen at the open, albeit marginally. Gilts have pushed on to trade in close proximity to session highs of 123.91, with traders eyeing the big figure ahead of Dec. 12th highs of 124.28. The marginal lift in Bunds has seen 10-yr yields fall below 0.18% (first time since 2017) with the German benchmark trading just over the 164.50 level with eyes set at the resistance level of 165.10 next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US debt futures have also kicked of the new year a touch higher, with the long end outperforming and 10 years topping out at 122-07.5, as focus in the US remains on the Government shutdown ahead of a congressional meeting today on border security. Note, this shutdown means multiple data releases will not go ahead as originally scheduled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.0%) prices are down due to oversupply concerns as US output continues to increase, with US output reaching an all-time high of 11.5mln BPD in October and Russia&rsquo;s December production of 11.45mln BPD vs. Prev. 11.37mln BPD. Prices are additionally weighed on by signs of a economic slowdown in China, with a Reuters survey of analysts forecasting 2019 average Brent prices at just over USD 69 a barrel; a drop of over USD 5 compared with the previous projection. UAE Energy Minister Mazrouei says that in light of the agreed OPEC+ production cut he is optimistic that oil market balance can be achieved in the first quarter of 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.4%) is in the green due to dollar weakness albeit just off of USD 1287.39/oz a 6-month high which was reached earlier in the session. Elsewhere, copper prices have moved lower as Chinese Manufacturing PMI has fallen into a contraction for the first time in 19 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraqi oil exports averaged 3.726mln BPD in Dec. as according to the oil ministry; Sothern Port Exports averaged 3.627mln BPD. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nigeria&#39;s NNPC says crude production was 2.09mln BPD in 2018 vs. prev.1.86mln BPD. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

The CAC (-1.7%) is underperforming its peers with index heavyweight Renault (-3.2%) towards the bottom of the index as the Co&rsquo;s Renault-Samsung Motors division reported a significant decrease in year-on-year sales for December; in addition, the political situation remains fraught in France. Sectors are also in the red, with some underperformance seen in materials and energy names due to Chinese Manufacturing PMI showing a contraction, and oil prices in the red due to continued oversupply concerns respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY entered the EU session on the backfoot with losses of around 0.3% and below the 96.00 level with JPY out-muscling the greenback during Asia-Pac trade as USD/JPY hit a 7-month low and currently resides on a 108 handle. JPY strength was largely driven by the broader risk environment as disappointing Chinese data overnight and the ongoing US government shutdown remain a key focus for investors. As the European session progressed, USD made a resurgence against its peers (ex-JPY) as losses in European equities accelerated following the cash open; DXY reclaimed 96.00 to the upside and trades relatively unchanged. EUR/USD eventually fell victim to the recovery in the USD (after testing 1.1500 to the upside during Asia-Pac trade) as the pair slipped below 1.1450 with some analysts also suggesting EUR/JPY selling as a potential catalyst for the move. As such, the pair has drifted towards 675mln of option expiries between 1.1452-30 with this morning&rsquo;s PMI metrics from the Eurozone unable to spur much in the way of noteworthy price action with core readings unrevised from their prior&rsquo;s. For GBP/USD, the pair began the session on the backfoot and slipped back below 1.2700 despite a high print of 1.2774 seen during Asia-Pac hours. Brexit-related commentary has been relatively light thus far with Parliament not returning from their winter break until 7th Jan. As such, the most interesting development for UK assets today has been the latest manufacturing PMI print which came in at 54.2 vs. Exp. 52.5 (Prev. 53.1). Cable briefly reclaimed 1.2700 to the upside before reversing gains with a pick-up in new orders largely attributed to stock-piling ahead of Brexit. Elsewhere, AUD/USD fell victim to the disappointing Chinese data overnight which saw Caixin mfg PMI slip into contractionary territory for the first time in 19 months. Losses were also spurred on by the aforementioned pick-up in USD, however, the pair maintains its status on a 0.7000 handle with option-related bids ahead of the key level said to have stopped the rot in the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt has derived little inspiration from the raft of European Manufacturing PMI data and continues to trade with a risk-off tone with both Gilt and Bunds continue the rise seen at the open, albeit marginally. Gilts have pushed on to trade in close proximity to session highs of 123.91, with traders eyeing the big figure ahead of Dec. 12th highs of 124.28. The marginal lift in Bunds has seen 10-yr yields fall below 0.18% (first time since 2017) with the German benchmark trading just over the 164.50 level with eyes set at the resistance level of 165.10 next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US debt futures have also kicked of the new year a touch higher, with the long end outperforming and 10 years topping out at 122-07.5, as focus in the US remains on the Government shutdown ahead of a congressional meeting today on border security. Note, this shutdown means multiple data releases will not go ahead as originally scheduled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.0%) prices are down due to oversupply concerns as US output continues to increase, with US output reaching an all-time high of 11.5mln BPD in October and Russia&rsquo;s December production of 11.45mln BPD vs. Prev. 11.37mln BPD. Prices are additionally weighed on by signs of a economic slowdown in China, with a Reuters survey of analysts forecasting 2019 average Brent prices at just over USD 69 a barrel; a drop of over USD 5 compared with the previous projection. UAE Energy Minister Mazrouei says that in light of the agreed OPEC+ production cut he is optimistic that oil market balance can be achieved in the first quarter of 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.5%) is in the green due to dollar weakness albeit just off of USD 1287.39/oz a 6-month high which was reached earlier in the session. Elsewhere, copper prices have moved lower as Chinese Manufacturing PMI has fallen into a contraction for the first time in 19 months.</p>\r\n",
