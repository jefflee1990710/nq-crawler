        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites down, Treasuries up, Dollar up, Crude mixed.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>China maintains rare earth minerals threat, Italy’s Salvini doubles down on intention to challenge EU rules, Strong US Consumer Confidence data, Strong EZ Sentiment data, Consumer Staples and Utilities Sectors hit</p><p><strong>* WEDNESDAY:</strong> GE Import Prices, FR GDP Q1, GE Employment Data, BoC Rate Decision, US API, BoJ’s Kuroda, ECB’s Mersch, Visco, Rehn, RBNZ Financial Stability Report</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>The South China Morning Post, shedding light on the breakdown in US-China trade talks, said they hit a snag due to the US side adding new demands in the late stages of the negotiations, some of which would directly affect China’s political and social stability, the newspaper claimed. Beijing was particularly angered by the additional tariffs, and what it saw as a US attempt to shift the blame onto China. In the US morning, the seemingly ubiquitous Global Times editor stated that China is seriously considering restricting rare earth exports to the US, and it may also take other countermeasures in the future; these suggestions have been rubbished by analysts in recent weeks (China would be cutting off its nose to spite its face, essentially), although his comments were later followed by a Chinese official, who stated that the nation will prioritise domestic demand for rare earths but are willing to meet other nation's reasonable demand, according to China's State Media, leaving open the possibility that China will weaponise rare earths.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Current Chancellor Hammond, speaking about the Conservative leadership race, said any PM pursuing a no-deal Brexit would face a confidence vote; it is a sign that there are still pro-EU lawmakers in the UK Parliament that would work to prevent any hard-line Tory leader attempting to leave in October without a deal. Elsewhere, UK PM met with European Council President Tusk today to update him on her resignation, to reiterate that it had been agreed with the EU that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened, and that no deal has remained the legal default.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The possibility of a showdown between Italy and the EU over the latter’s debt was in the spotlight for a second day (following Monday’s reports Italy could be fined up to EUR 4bln for excessive debt levels). Italian Deputy PM Salvini reiterated his critiques of EU fiscal rules; saying rules should be aimed at cutting unemployment instead of keeping deficits below 3%, whilst confirming his intention to propose his EUR 30bln flat tax to the cabinet and vowing not to agree to increase taxes in his letter to the EU. Salvini also proposed a conference to discuss the role of the ECB and its role in guaranteeing government debt, while Italian PM Conte weighed in, saying he is reviewing the ECB’s mandate to guarantee public debt as an open dossier that requires a lot of work. European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Moscovici said that he is not in favour of sanctioning Italy, whilst European Commission Vice President Dombrovkis said he cannot confirm reports about potential fines on Italy and the Commission will next week assess the compliance of member states looking into FY 19/20.</p><p><strong>* EU SUCCESSION: </strong>EU leaders meet at an informal summit tonight in Brussels to discuss the Election results and likely the EU’s top jobs, particularly the European Commission President and head of the ECB. The main frontrunner for the role of EC President remains EPP head Manfred Webe, whose claim is supported by the Spitzenkandidaten process (which enjoys EP support). French President Macron, however, has said he would prefer European Commissioner for Competition Vestager, EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier or EC VP Timmermans (who also enjoys support from the Spanish PM and EU Parliament Social Democrat Leader Bullmann). Whoever takes the ECB top spot will likely depend on who gets the role of EC head; Villeroy de Galhau and Oli Rehn are in the running, but Weidmann remains a potential if Weber fails to get the EC President job. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-european-commission-president-and-ecb-president-front-runners-28-05-2019\">Click here for a more in-depth analysis.</a></p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>France said they have an indication of chemical weapon use in Idlib, Syria. The US State Department later said it is alarmed by Russian and Syrian government airstrikes in North West Syria and attacks on civilians and public infrastructure are a reckless escalation of the conflict. On Iran, the US State Department noted that it was not aware of an Iran backed channel. Elsewhere, the Qatari Foreign Minister met with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister in Doha to review developments in the Middle East and expressed concerns over recent escalations. The Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister also said Iran is ready to engage in talks with the Gulf states regarding stability of the region but did not mention talks with the US. On North Korea, the US State Department commented that North Korea’s entire weapons of mass destruction programme is a violation of the UN resolution, before switching to the Libya conflict to note that the Hafta campaign can play an important role in Libya.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>US Consumer Confidence rose to 134.1 in May (exp. 130.0, prev. 129.2); jobs “plentiful” increased from 46.5% to 47.2%, while those claiming jobs are “hard to get” declining from 13.3% to 10.9%, thus bringing the gap between Jobs plentiful and Jobs hard to get from 33.2% to 36.3%, auguring well for next week’s Employment Situation Report. Oxford Economics notes that, despite the recent escalation in trade tensions, consumers continued to grow more confident about both the present situation and the near-term outlook, after the headline rose to a six-month high, nearing this cycle’s peak. “The robust labour market is keeping consumers upbeat and points to a modest spending rebound in Q2,” Oxford Economics says, “while we expect consumer spending to firm in Q2, momentum is likely to remain on a downward trend through the rest of the year,” the consultancy writes, noting that real disposable income growth has cooled from above 3% Y/Y in Q4, down to 2.3% in March as the impact of fiscal stimulus has faded. “This will weigh on real spending momentum, which we expect to fall to around 2% Y/Y in Q4 2019, down from 2.6% in Q4 2018,” OxEco says.</p><p><strong>* EZ SENTIMENT:</strong> Headline beta the consensus (105.1, exp. 104.0, prev rev 103.9), with both industrial and services confidence rising. However, the Business Climate Indicator fell to 0.30 from 0.42 (cons 0.4). Pantheon Macroeconomics said the survey has been a poor leading indicator for GDP growth in recent quarters; it has captured the direction in growth, but not the overall pace. “That said, this month’s increase is the first month-to-month rise since June last year,” PM says, “this is not conclusive evidence of anything, but it is a much welcome change from the recent uninterrupted decline.”</p><p>* <strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 16 TICKS HIGHER AT 125-12+</strong>: The Tplex traded directionally higher on Tuesday, with new contract highs made in Ultra longs, USM9s, Ultras and TYM9s. Looking at the curve, the belly saw the largest fall in yields, with 7-year yields posting 19-month lows; the front-to-belly saw curve flattening with the 2s/10s spread settling c. 2bps flatter, whereas the 10/s/30s steepened by c. 1.3bps. Elsewhere, the US 2-year auction was solid, stopped through the screens by 1bps (high yield 2.125%). Cover was firm at 2.75x (highest since August 2018), above recent averages and the previous. Dealer take down fell beneath recent averages as well as the prior (26.2%, the lowest since Jan 2018vs 36.1% six-auction average), leaving directs with 27.2% (largest since May 2016, six auction average 16.4%), and indirects with 46.6% (slightly beneath the 47.6% six-auction average). The 5-year auction was more in line with recent auctions, stopping through the screens by 0.2bps on a high yield of 2.065% (lowest yield since October 2017), covered 2.38x (six auction average 2.36x). Dealers took a touch below recent averages at 24.2% (largest share since January, six auction average 26.3%), directs took 18.4% (highest since February, and up from 15% six-auction average), leaving indirects with 57.5% (a shade beneath the 58.6% six-auction average).</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>SocGen says the 7-year sector trades fair on the curve vs 5s and 10s, and trades slightly rich against older 7s from a relative value standpoint. The bank notes that the WI is trading beneath all prior auction high yields since September 2017, which is a negative; and accordingly, will likely need to see concession going into the auction on an outright basis. The previous 7-year auction was poor, tailing. However, dealer holdings in the 6- to 7-year bucket are the lowest since October 2018, and may provide marginal support for the auction.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.51 HIGHER AT USD 59.14/BBL; BRENT (N9) FUTURES SETTLE UNCHANGED AT USD 70.11/BBL: </strong>Crude markets came off their highs on Tuesday going into the US session, before reproaching them, in what was a choppy day of trade. Analysts at Citi summarise that ongoing geopolitical risks to supply are also providing some fresh support, and the analysts go on to highlight recent comments from Saudi Arabia that points the finger at Iran for backing Yemen’s Houthi rebels, in addition to ramped up conflict in Libya. It is worth highlighting that option expiry in Brent on Tuesday may dictate some price movement as a result of book squaring; also, the usual API data release for US inventories is delayed by 24 hours due to the closure of US markets on Monday (will be released after market on Wednesday, and DOE data to be released Thursday). Elsewhere, sources reported that supplies of Urals heading to Germany and Poland via Druzhba are planned at 65k tonnes per day following next month's pipeline restart, in July supplies are forecast to return to their normal level of 145k tonnes per day.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.9% at 2802, NASDAQ-100 -0.3% at 7278, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.9% at 25349; SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary -0.5%, Consumer Staples -1.8%, Energy -1.1%, Financials -1.1%, Health Care -1.4%, Industrials -1%, Information Technology -0.3%, Materials -0.9%, Telecommunication Services 0.2%, Utilities -1.6%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Consumer Staples, including Kraft Heinz (KHC), underperformed today, amidst weak Nielsen data. Utilities also suffered, with some traders citing the possibility of end of month MSCI rebalancing. FedEx (FDX) was under pressure on the fall-out from a package dispute with Huawei, in which the freight service shipped items to the wrong address. General Electric (GE) managed to reverse early losses after the automaker announced it would fire 1000 workers in France, much to the consternation of the French government. Total System Services (TSS) caught a bid after a merger between the co. and Global Payments Inc (GPN). Global Payments Inc moved lower. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) jumped higher after receiving an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) soured after the chipmaker announced its 7nm product roadmap at Computex. Competitor Intel (INTC) fell, with Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsey noting the loss of a key advantage it had over Advanced Micro Devices. Mylan (MYL) fell after UBS sharply reduced their PT for the co. Tobacco names, including Altria (MO) and Philip Morris International (PM), fell at the open as studies emerged over the weekend linking flavoured E-cigarettes to certain types of cancer. Beyond Meat (BYND) jumped higher after receiving a flurry of favourable broker initiations.</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW:</strong> The BOC is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.75%, with the market expecting the central bank to reiterate a dovish message, despite some upside surprises in data of late. There is no post-meeting press conference nor updated economic projections at this meeting. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21938/download\">Click here for in depth analysis.</a></p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>moved higher for a second day, DXY finding further support after much better than expected consumer confidence numbers.<strong> EUR </strong>was marginally softer on the day, moving to the bottom of the recent its recent 1.1175-1.1215 range, as the market eyes the growing prospect of an Italy/EU confrontation. <strong>JPY </strong>gained some momentum amid a risk off feel during European morning trade, but found support at 109.20 (vs USD) before reversing the move to finish the day marginally higher as US risk assets moved marginally higher. <strong>GBP</strong> was more-or-less flat, with any downside capped as Chancellor Hammond reminded us that, given parliamentary opposition, a no deal outcome remains unlikely. <strong>CAD</strong> was weaker ahead of BoC, where the central bank is expected to reiterate a dovish message. <strong>TRY </strong>was stronger on the day, but unable to substantially break 6.00 (vs USD) to the downside, the turn around also coinciding with news Turkey had asked local banks to purchase more TRY-denominated bonds.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Remains slightly sub-1.12, ignoring EU elections, with desks suggesting the currency is paying more attention to US/China trade talks (some suggested this was perhaps a function of a stable yuan fixing overnight, lending stability to the EUR). Italy also a situation to keep track of (widening bund/BTP differentials could pressure the EUR, as seen on Monday), though the single currency largely ignored widening Bund/BTP spreads. Some desks have said they prefer selling rallies overall, and amid the lack of data, there will be attention if 1.11 holds; shorts may be added on a breach, other desks have said. Levels: 1.1055 (YTD low), 1.1100/05, 1.11 (shorts may be added, DB says), 1.1180 (Monday high), 1.1196 (30dma), 1.1215/20 (UBS says good level to short), 1.1265 (last week’s high).</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Range now seems to be 109-110.50, with some desks suggesting a bias to sell rallies. However, be cautious about month-end demand for USD. EURJPY stable considering scope for potential ramp-up in tensions between EC/Italy. Levels: 108.50 (31 Jan lo), 109.02 (13 May lo), 109.05/15/20, 109.30 (expect bids to emerge like last week), 109.675 (21 May hi), 109.75/80, 110.00 (UBS suggests adding shorts), 110.30 (shorts covering in this area last week), 110.96 (post trade tensions hi)&nbsp; 110.30/35, 112.40 (ytd hi). EURJPY 122.00 break could open the way to 121.50.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The rise of the Brexit Party, and a likely pro-Brexit conservative leader keeps GBP under pressure as it raises risks of a no deal Brexit. However, whether or not those fears appear overdone still remain to be seen, given that Parliament is still unlikely to allow a pro-Brexit PM to lead the country out of the EU without a deal, as current Chancellor Hammond reminds us today. Some even remind us that a lot of this narrative is/was already in the price, and accordingly, sharper downside might be limited in absence of a fresh catalyst. Technically, a failure to remain above 1.2725/30 sees the pair drift lower, techs say (and some suggest a good region to add shorts) with a reassessment above 1.2815/20. Levels: 1.2441 (ytd low), 1.2480, 1.2580/85, 1.2600/05 (26 May lo), 1.2645/50, 1.2695/00, 1.2730/50, 1.2754 (weekly hi), 1.2815/20, 1.2870/80. EURGBP levels: 0.8791 (200dma), 0.8693 (100dma), 0.8850 (24 May hi), 0.8867 (61.8% fib Jan-Mar).</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> Range seems to be 1.3370-1.3570. BOC on Wednesday, expected to reiterate the need for accommodation despite the data surprises to the upside. Meanwhile, WTI providing no clear catalyst as it remains around the USD 60 mark. Levels: 1.3255 (200dma), 1.3310 (trend line support), 1.3335/40 (100dma region), 1.34/07 (region to potentially buy the dip, 100dma), 1.3480/00, 1.3500/20 (sell rallies, though breach risks topside breakout).</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Desks note there has been a failure to extend downside, despite a dovish RBA last week, and bank desks revising their RBA views lower. Bounces might be harder given market expectations of an RBA rate cut on 4 June. Levels: 0.6850 (close below would be bearish, techs say), 0.6865/70 (last week’s bottom), 0.6900/10 (close below would open up technical downside), 0.6945/50 (techs build shorts, reassess short bias above), 0.6970/80, 0.7000/10.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> Seems to have fared better than other EMFX on Tuesday, despite a tense political situation, and the weekend’s pro-Bolsonaro protests, which were calling for fiscal reforms to be passed; these protests followed others in mid-May, which protested the government’s 30% freeze on discretionary spending for public universities. Last week, economy adviser threatened to resign if pension reform was watered down. Congress is working on its own version of the Bill, and the government is willing to consider it so long as it maintains a high level of fiscal savings (the government sees BRL 1trln over a 10-year period; analysts say there could be a sharp sell-off in Brazilian assets if that figure falls to/below BRL 500bln. GDP data on Thursday is a data point to keep an eye on.</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> the announcement of the new cabinet has been delayed to later in the week. The candidacy of David Mabuza for reappointment to the role of Vice President is controversial, as he is under a number of graft investigations. Last week’s dovish SARB is not doing much to help the slide, after opening the door to a potential rate cut later in the year, while Eskom’s finances are also a fiscal concern. JPMorgan today recommended a small long in USDZAR. Levels: 14.5865, 14.75.</p>",

It is worth highlighting that option expiry in Brent on Tuesday may dictate some price movement as a result of book squaring; also, the usual API data release for US inventories is delayed by 24 hours due to the closure of US markets on Monday (will be released after market on Wednesday, and DOE data to be released Thursday). Elsewhere, sources reported that supplies of Urals heading to Germany and Poland via Druzhba are planned at 65k tonnes per day following next month's pipeline restart, in July supplies are forecast to return to their normal level of 145k tonnes per day.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Usd/G10 pairs rangy, but Lira and Rand break ranks",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar is struggling to derive any additional impetus from much better than forecast US consumer confidence, as the index holds within a tight 97.877-688 range and inside support and resistance at 97.500 and 98.000, like a 97.541 Fib. However, Usd/majors are mostly flat to firmer, with the <strong>CHF</strong> and <strong>CAD</strong> especially weak after mixed data and in advance of the BoC policy meeting on Wednesday. To recap, Q1 GDP topped consensus by some distance, but the trade surplus was narrower than forecast and the Swiss Government downplayed the unexpectedly strong expansion as one-off factors boosted growth. Meanwhile, the Loonie looks cautious ahead of tomorrow’s BoC policy meeting and the possibility that the latest guidance is dovish – see our headline feed for a full preview. Usd/Chf has climbed to just shy of 1.0090, Eur/Chf to within a pip of 1.1275 and Usd/Cad faded around 1.3480. Back to the Buck specically, month end factors may be positive in May for a change as Citi’s preliminary rebalancing model flags a buy, and a particularly strong signal against the Pound.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars are off best levels, but still firm vs their US peer around 0.6935 and 0.6550 with the Aussie clawing back some recent losses ahead of June’s RBA meeting (1/4 point ease completely factored in) and the Kiwi eyeing Wednesday’s RBNZ Financial Stability Review for potential independent impetus.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd as the Yen retreated from resistance ahead of 109.00 yet again to retest lows circa 109.60, while the single currency continues to hit technical levels around 1.1200 and meet underlying buying interest ahead of recent lows (including the 2019 base just above 1.1100). Fundamentally, Eurozone economic and political impulses remain a weight, with a relatively bleak German outlook for 2019 from the DIHK and Italian-EU divergences on finances resurfacing ahead of next week’s budget review and potential EDP launch. Similarly, Brexit and the UK political void soon to be left by PM May continues to hamper the Pound as Cable trades on the heavy side of 1.2655-1.2700 boundaries and Eur/Gbp holds firm above 0.8800, albeit down from recent peaks.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to the relatively confined parameters mentioned above, the Try and Zar have diverged quite sharply. The Lira has managed to revisit 6.0000 and a bit above vs the Usd in wake of yesterday’s 200 bp RRR tightening and in spite of a marked deterioration in Turkish economic sentiment, but the Rand has been hit hard by renewed political concerns following approval for SA President Ramaphosa to bring back Mabuza into parliament (who is under investigation for fraud, corruption and worse). Usd/Zar is hovering above 14.7000 and has been up over 14.7400. Elsewhere, another marginal move up in the Usd/Cny fix overnight left the spread to Usd/Cnh on a wider trajectory, but the former could be set higher in wake of the PBoC’s move to raise its counter cyclical ‘adjustments’, while prioritising the use of rare earths on the domestic front and potentially restricting exports to the US.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>EC PRESIDENT JOB:</strong> Ahead of tonight’s informal summit in Brussels to discuss the Election results and likely the EU’s top jobs, particularly the European Commission President and head of the ECB, a number of frontrunners have emerged for these roles. In spite of the two largest parties, the EPP and S&amp;D, not holding a majority the EPP’s head Manfred Weber remains a key contender due to the Spitzenkandidaten concept. ING notes that on balance Weber’s case is neither stronger nor weaker in the new parliamentary layout. His claim is bolstered by an EP statement which is reportedly to state that there is broad support for the Spitzenkandidaten system, and the Eurosceptics did not outright reject the concept. However, French President Macron has stated that the European Commissioner for Competition Vestager, EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier and EC VP Timmermans are the contenders who meet his criteria.</li><li><strong>ECB PRESIDENT JOB</strong>: The other key appointment is who will succeed Draghi as the ECB’s head, with this likely to be heavily influenced by who is appointed to as the European Commission President. Capital Economics highlights that if Weber is appointed then this will effectively block Weidmann. Although, as French President Macron has indicated his support for other candidates, this does create potential for Weidmann. Berenberg, meanwhile, suggests that Weber’s appointment would likely lead to France nominating Villeroy de Galhau as Draghi’s replacement as a consolation to France. Alternatively, Oli Rehn could be appointed as a compromise between Germany and France; particularly in the event that neither Weber or any of the candidates outlined by Macron become the new European Commission President.</li><li>During this process it is worth bearing in mind that the FT cites Macron as saying that tonight’s discussion should not be of specific names that the discussions should be pertinent to the qualities they are seeking in candidates. ING points out that this process could continue for an extended period of time, assuming European Commission President Juncker is prepared to remain as caretaker until the process is resolved.</li></ul>",

News flow has been light, but amid US President Trump’s visit to Japan, it was reported he had asked his Japanese counterpart PM Abe to help him establish a summit with Iran. However, later an Iranian spokesperson said that the Persian Gulf nation sees no prospect for negotiations with the US.&nbsp;</li><li>Analysts at RBC take an interesting approach to recent rising crude inventories, \"we do not interpret the recent increases as entirely bearish given the majority of builds from the US to consuming Asia have been deliberate and tactical which has, in turn, kept markets tight.\" It suggests many consuming Asia countries will likely be building stocks due to the sudden cut off from Iranian exports, and more broadly that countries are purposefully and pre-emptively doing so ahead of an increasingly tight physical market. The note goes on to clarify that although calendar spreads, particularly Brent, are in steep backwardation, consuming countries have been stocking up for energy security while forfeiting roll yield, whereas discretionary hubs have been drawing reflecting the tightness.</li><li>Focusing specifically on the US crude market, in RBC's opinion, \"refiners have over recent months, been purposefully bidding up waterborne crude to close the export arbitrage window to prevent the swing barrel from leaving the US Gulf Coast.\" The note highlights the front-end contango in WTI, which it cites as market fears over recent builds, which it believes \"have largely been a function of catching up and rebuilding stocks to prevent inventories from over tightening ahead of peak summer runs.\"</li></ul>",

The Greens &amp; Liberals also put in a strong showing, especially in France, Germany and the UK. In sum, the four largest pro-European parties saw their combined share of the vote fall to 67% from 70%. Focus now falls on the Parliamentary arithmetic with the EPP and S&amp;D unable to achieve a majority alone, as such are likely to team up with the Alliance of Liberals and Democratics. Today’s summit’s focus is on who becomes the next European Commission President with Manfred Weber expected to maintain his claim, though VP Timmermans or Competition Commissioner Vestager are contenders.

Most major European bourses are experiencing broad-based losses although Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.9%) underperforms as banking names are weighed on by the decline in BTPs, whilst the UK’s FTSE (Unch) is supported by heavyweight mining names (Rio Tinto +3.2%, BHP +1.8%, Antofagasta +2.2%) profiting from the surge in iron ore price. Thus, the sector is outperforming whilst most of the other sectors are posting broad-based losses. In terms of individual movers, Renault (+0.7%) shares are higher in a continuation of yesterday’s rise due to a potential Renault-Fiat Chrysler merger. Richemont (-0.6%) and Swatch (-0.8%) are subdued amid a Swiss watch export decline of 0.4% Y/Y. Finally, Thyssenkrupp (+3.2%) rose to the top of the DAX amid a rise in steel prices. In terms of some analysis from Nomura Quant, amongst major hedge funds, macro funds are tilting short equities, with overall sentiment on US-China trade discussions on a gradual downtrend. Whilst some short-lived rallies may yet come, little optimism is seen on the immediate horizon, and it is unlikely hedge funds and CTAs will be convinced to return to buying. “It also looks likely to us that CTAs will go back to closing out long positions in NASDAQ 100 futures and S&amp;P 500 futures starting today” says Nomura.</p><p>E-Cigarette/Tobacco Names – e-cigarette flavourings may damage the cells that line blood vessels and pose a risk for consumers long-term heart health according to a study. (Axios)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Buck remains off recent key day reversal or retracement lows, but the DXY is still struggling to regain sufficient momentum for an attempt to revisit 98.000 and 2019 peaks reached only last Thursday (98.373). However, in a twist to normal month end trends, equity rebalancing flows may be Dollar supportive this week as at least one preliminary model is signalling a net buy, and especially strong against Sterling vs relatively weak demand against the Yen.</p><p><strong>JPY/NOK/SEK - </strong>The clear G10 outperformers as Usd/Jpy retreats from 109.50+ highs to test support ahead of 109.00 at a 109.23 Fib amidst a broad downturn in risk sentiment, while the Scandi Crowns continue to derive encouragement from last week’s stellar unemployment developments rather than less upbeat sentiment indicators today. Indeed, Eur/Nok has had a look at 9.2000 ahead of a key downside technical level in the form of the 100 DMA (9.7190), with extra impetus from higher Norwegian oil investment forecasts, while Eur/Sek is back below 10.7000 and has been under 10.6750.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD - </strong>The next best majors as the Kiwi holds above 0.6500 vs its US counterpart awaiting the latest RBNZ Financial Stability Report due tomorrow and the Aussie maintains 0.6900+ status ahead of next week’s RBA policy meeting with a 25 bp rate cut all but totally priced in. On that note, Aud/Usd may well be capped by macro offers</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/CHF - </strong>All slightly softer vs the Greenback, as the Loonie pivots 1.3450 and trades cautiously into Wednesday’s BoC (full preview available on the Ransquawk Research Suite), while the Pound hovers closer to the base of a 1.2700-1.2655 range in the fall-out from last week’s formal notice of resignation from UK PM May and the weekend EU Parliamentary elections, and with the aforementioned end of May Cable signals hardly helping. In similar vein, the Franc has not been able to glean much, if any traction from much stronger than forecast Swiss GDP, as the Government was quick to caution that one-off factors impacted favourably in Q1 and it would not be raising its full year growth forecast on the back of a bumper first quarter, while April’s trade surplus was smaller than expected. Usd/Chf is firmly above recent lows within a tight 1.0050-35 band and Eur/Chf is also looking more solid on the 1.1200 handle between 1.1245-25 vs sub-big figure levels last week.</p><p><strong>EUR - </strong>As noted above, the single currency has rebounded off worst levels vs the Franc despite the return of Italian/EU fiscal tensions, and the Euro is also displaying a degree of resilience against the Dollar within 1.1176-1.1200 trading parameters, albeit not convincingly through 30 DMA resistance (1.1196) or beyond 1.1200 to challenge a Fib at 1.1215.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Another marginal move up in the Usd/Cny fix overnight still leaves the spread to Usd/Cnh on a wider trajectory, but the former could be set higher in wake of the PBoC’s move to raise its counter cyclical ‘adjustments’. Elsewhere, the Try has finally reaped some benefit from Monday’s CBRT hike in the RRR, but Turkey is still embroiled in geopolitical and diplomatic conflicts that could see the Lira lurch again.</p><p>Swiss Govt. Economist says that the strong Q1 GDP figures don't mean an automatic upgrade to annual forecasts, general environment remains the same. Growth was helped by one-offs, but negatives still present; cite trade war, Brexit and Germany as risks. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Some signs of stabilisation in overall risk sentiment via the Dax future reclaiming 12k and 10 year Italian debt getting a reprieve of sorts from EU’s Moscovici and Dombrovskis, have combined to take some of the shine off safe-haven Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries. However, the core Eurozone bond remains above par having tailed off just ahead of 168.00 at 167.91 (+27 ticks on the day), while its UK equivalent is still over ¼ point ahead and the corresponding 10 year T-note is 11 ticks ahead as the latter 2 hold corrective gains after Monday’s holidays. Ahead, Italy must await for official budget judgement next week before it is out of the EDP firing line, while the PM agenda holds US housing data and supply after satisfactory auctions from Germany and Italy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures have been relatively resilient to the risk aversion around the market with the former hovering above USD 59/bbl and the latter around USD 70.50/bbl</strong>. Of note, there was no WTI settlement yesterday and thus there is a deviation in price change between the two benchmarks. Nevertheless, WTI’s discount to Brent has been gaining more focus, with the WTI/Brent Arb now almost USD -11/bbl. The widening spread is attributed to US stockpiles building keeping WTI subdued, whilst Brent is supported by the Russian oil contamination. Analysts at RBC highlight that physical markets are tight, and inventories are piling up despite the backwardated term structure. “We do not interpret the recent increases as entirely bearish given that the majority of builds from the US to consuming Asia have been deliberate and tactical which has, in turn, kept markets tight” RBC says. Meanwhile, gold (Unch) is flat on the day, but the yellow metal nursed some of its overnight losses as the risk tone deteriorated further, from a technical perspective; immediate levels to the upside include the 50 DMA at 1288.12/oz ahead of the psychological 1290/oz.&nbsp; Elsewhere, copper remains lacklustre amid the downbeat risk tone, as prices fluctuate on either side of USD 2.70/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore prices spiked to record highs amid ongoing supply concerns and with stockpiles around 2yr lows.</p><p>Russian Energy Minister Novak hopes OPEC and partners will be able to formalise the OPEC+ agreement by June with the adoption of a new charter.

        "subject": "RANsquawk EU Mid Session: Choppy as UK and US re-join the market whilst BTP/Bund spread widens amid Italy/EU friction - 28th May 2019",
        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/21933/download\">here</a> If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal. To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A downbeat session thus far for European equities [Eurostoxx 50 -0.6%] as the region failed to capitalise on the positive momentum seen in Asia.</strong> Most major European bourses are experiencing broad-based losses although Italy’s FTSE MIB (-1.1%) underperforms as banking names are weighed on by the decline in BTPs, whilst the UK’s FTSE (Unch) is supported by heavyweight mining names (Rio Tinto +3.2%, BHP +1.8%, Antofagasta +2.2%) profiting from the surge in iron ore price. Thus, the sector is outperforming whilst most of the other sectors are posting broad-based losses. In terms of individual movers, Renault (+0.7%) shares are higher in a continuation of yesterday’s rise due to a potential Renault-Fiat Chrysler merger. Richemont (-0.6%) and Swatch (-0.8%) are subdued amid a Swiss watch export decline of 0.4% Y/Y. Finally, Thyssenkrupp (+3.2%) rose to the top of the DAX amid a rise in steel prices. In terms of some analysis from Nomura Quant, amongst major hedge funds, macro funds are tilting short equities, with overall sentiment on US-China trade discussions on a gradual downtrend. Whilst some short-lived rallies may yet come, little optimism is seen on the immediate horizon, and it is unlikely hedge funds and CTAs will be convinced to return to buying. “It also looks likely to us that CTAs will go back to closing out long positions in NASDAQ 100 futures and S&amp;P 500 futures starting today” says Nomura.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Buck remains off recent key day reversal or retracement lows, but the DXY is still struggling to regain sufficient momentum for an attempt to revisit 98.000 and 2019 peaks reached only last Thursday (98.373). However, in a twist to normal month end trends, equity rebalancing flows may be Dollar supportive this week as at least one preliminary model is signalling a net buy, and especially strong against Sterling vs relatively weak demand against the Yen.</p><p><strong>JPY/NOK/SEK</strong> - The clear G10 outperformers as Usd/Jpy retreats from 109.50+ highs to test support ahead of 109.00 at a 109.23 Fib amidst a broad downturn in risk sentiment, while the Scandi Crowns continue to derive encouragement from last week’s stellar unemployment developments rather than less upbeat sentiment indicators today. Indeed, Eur/Nok has had a look at 9.2000 ahead of a key downside technical level in the form of the 100 DMA (9.7190), with extra impetus from higher Norwegian oil investment forecasts, while Eur/Sek is back below 10.7000 and has been under 10.6750.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - The next best majors as the Kiwi holds above 0.6500 vs its US counterpart awaiting the latest RBNZ Financial Stability Report due tomorrow and the Aussie maintains 0.6900+ status ahead of next week’s RBA policy meeting with a 25 bp rate cut all but totally priced in. On that note, Aud/Usd may well be capped by macro offers</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/CHF</strong> - All slightly softer vs the Greenback, as the Loonie pivots 1.3450 and trades cautiously into Wednesday’s BoC (full preview available on the Ransquawk Research Suite), while the Pound hovers closer to the base of a 1.2700-1.2655 range in the fall-out from last week’s formal notice of resignation from UK PM May and the weekend EU Parliamentary elections, and with the aforementioned end of May Cable signals hardly helping. In similar vein, the Franc has not been able to glean much, if any traction from much stronger than forecast Swiss GDP, as the Government was quick to caution that one-off factors impacted favourably in Q1 and it would not be raising its full year growth forecast on the back of a bumper first quarter, while April’s trade surplus was smaller than expected. Usd/Chf is firmly above recent lows within a tight 1.0050-35 band and Eur/Chf is also looking more solid on the 1.1200 handle between 1.1245-25 vs sub-big figure levels last week.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong> - As noted above, the single currency has rebounded off worst levels vs the Franc despite the return of Italian/EU fiscal tensions, and the Euro is also displaying a degree of resilience against the Dollar within 1.1176-1.1200 trading parameters, albeit not convincingly through 30 DMA resistance (1.1196) or beyond 1.1200 to challenge a Fib at 1.1215.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Another marginal move up in the Usd/Cny fix overnight still leaves the spread to Usd/Cnh on a wider trajectory, but the former could be set higher in wake of the PBoC’s move to raise its counter cyclical ‘adjustments’. Elsewhere, the Try has finally reaped some benefit from Monday’s CBRT hike in the RRR, but Turkey is still embroiled in geopolitical and diplomatic conflicts that could see the Lira lurch again.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Some signs of stabilisation in overall risk sentiment via the Dax future reclaiming 12k and <strong>10 year Italian debt</strong> getting a reprieve of sorts from EU’s Moscovici and Dombrovskis, have combined to take some of the shine off safe-haven <strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong>. However, the <strong>core Eurozone bond</strong> remains above par having tailed off just ahead of 168.00 at 167.91 (+27 ticks on the day), while its UK equivalent is still over ¼ point ahead and the corresponding 10 year T-note is 11 ticks ahead as the latter 2 hold corrective gains after Monday’s holidays. Ahead, Italy must await for official budget judgement next week before it is out of the EDP firing line, while the PM agenda holds US housing data and supply after satisfactory auctions from Germany and Italy.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures have been relatively resilient to the risk aversion around the market with the former hovering above USD 59/bbl and the latter around USD 70.50/bbl. Of note, there was no WTI settlement yesterday and thus there is a deviation in price change between the two benchmarks. Nevertheless, WTI’s discount to Brent has been gaining more focus, with the WTI/Brent Arb now almost USD -11/bbl. The widening spread is attributed to US stockpiles building keeping WTI subdued, whilst Brent is supported by the Russian oil contamination. Analysts at RBC highlight that physical markets are tight, and inventories are piling up despite the backwardated term structure. “We do not interpret the recent increases as entirely bearish given that the majority of builds from the US to consuming Asia have been deliberate and tactical which has, in turn, kept markets tight” RBC says. Meanwhile, gold (Unch) is flat on the day, but the yellow metal nursed some of its overnight losses as the risk tone deteriorated further, from a technical perspective; immediate levels to the upside include the 50 DMA at 1288.12/oz ahead of the psychological 1290/oz.&nbsp; Elsewhere, copper remains lacklustre amid the downbeat risk tone, as prices fluctuate on either side of USD 2.70/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore prices spiked to record highs amid ongoing supply concerns and with stockpiles around 2yr lows.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck remains off recent key day reversal or retracement lows, but the <strong>DXY</strong> is still struggling to regain sufficient momentum for an attempt to revisit 98.000 and 2019 peaks reached only last Thursday (98.373). However, in a twist to normal month end trends, equity rebalancing flows may be Dollar supportive this week as at least one preliminary model is signalling a net buy, and especially strong against Sterling vs relatively weak demand against the Yen.</p><p><strong>JPY/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The clear G10 outperformers as Usd/Jpy retreats from 109.50+ highs to test support ahead of 109.00 at a 109.23 Fib amidst a broad downturn in risk sentiment, while the Scandi Crowns continue to derive encouragement from last week’s stellar unemployment developments rather than less upbeat sentiment indicators today. Indeed, Eur/Nok has had a look at 9.2000 ahead of a key downside technical level in the form of the 100 DMA (9.7190), with extra impetus from higher Norwegian oil investment forecasts, while Eur/Sek is back below 10.7000 and has been under 10.6750.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The next best majors as the Kiwi holds above 0.6500 vs its US counterpart awaiting the latest RBNZ Financial Stability Report due tomorrow and the Aussie maintains 0.6900+ status ahead of next week’s RBA policy meeting with a 25 bp rate cut all but totally priced in. On that note, Aud/Usd may well be capped by macro offers&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>All slightly softer vs the Greenback, as the Loonie pivots 1.3450 and trades cautiously into Wednesday’s BoC (full preview available on the Ransquawk Research Suite), while the Pound hovers closer to the base of a 1.2700-1.2655 range in the fall-out from last week’s formal notice of resignation from UK PM May and the weekend EU Parliamentary elections, and with the aforementioned end of May Cable signals hardly helping. In similar vein, the Franc has not been able to glean much, if any traction from much stronger than forecast Swiss GDP, as the Government was quick to caution that one-off factors impacted favourably in Q1 and it would not be raising its full year growth forecast on the back of a bumper first quarter, while April’s trade surplus was smaller than expected. Usd/Chf is firmly above recent lows within a tight 1.0050-35 band and Eur/Chf is also looking more solid on the 1.1200 handle between 1.1245-25 vs sub-big figure levels last week.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>As noted above, the single currency has rebounded off worst levels vs the Franc despite the return of Italian/EU fiscal tensions, and the Euro is also displaying a degree of resilience against the Dollar within 1.1176-1.1200 trading parameters, albeit not convincingly through 30 DMA resistance (1.1196) or beyond 1.1200 to challenge a Fib at 1.1215.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another marginal move up in the Usd/Cny fix overnight still leaves the spread to Usd/Cnh on a wider trajectory, but the former could be set higher in wake of the PBoC’s move to raise its counter cyclical ‘adjustments’. Elsewhere, the Try has finally reaped some benefit from Monday’s CBRT hike in the RRR, but Turkey is still embroiled in geopolitical and diplomatic conflicts that could see the Lira lurch again.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly higher but with gains capped as trade slowly picked up from the holiday lull seen in global counterparts following closures in both US and UK. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.5%) was positive with the gains led by the tech sector and as miners cheered the recent upside in commodities including Chinese benchmark iron ore prices which hit record highs. Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was underpinned by corporate news flow with Tokyo Electron lifted from a JPY 150bln buyback, while Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors gained following the recent merger proposal between alliance partner Renault and Fiat. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) also gained following a substantial liquidity injection of CNY 150bln by the PBoC which placed the ongoing trade uncertainty on the back seat. Finally, 10yr JGBs were steady as they mirrored the sideways trade in T-note futures although saw mild support following the results from the 40yr JGB auction where the b/c was firmer than previous and as 40yr yields hit their lowest levels since September 2016.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher but with gains capped amid a relatively quiet session following the holiday lull seen in global counterparts due to closures in both US and UK. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.5%) is positive with tech leading the gains and as miners benefit from recent upside in commodities including Chinese benchmark iron ore prices hitting record levels. Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) is underpinned by corporate news flow with Tokyo Electron lifted from a JPY 150bln buyback, while Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors gain following the recent merger proposal between alliance partner Renault and Fiat. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) are positive following a substantial liquidity injection of CNY 150bln by the PBoC which helped shift the ongoing trade uncertainty to the back seat.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is relatively rangebound amid a lack of key data releases and after the recent holiday closures, although the DXY extends on the prior day’s gains as its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD languish following a pullback below the 1.1200 and 1.2700 handles respectively. EUR was pressured at the start of the week amid widening Bund/BTP yield differentials after reports the EC might open up proceedings on Italy over high debt, while GBP remains uninspired after the long weekend and Brexit Party’s strong showing at the European Parliamentary elections. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is rangebound and antipodeans are steady as they patiently await the upcoming potential key catalysts including the RBNZ Financial Stability Report and Governor Orr comments in tomorrow’s session, as well as Australia Capex data on Thursday and a widely anticipated RBA rate cut next week.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are steady as they mirror the sideways trade in T-notes and with participants sidelined ahead of a 40yr auction later.</p>",
