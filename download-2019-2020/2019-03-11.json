(Newswires)</p><p>MARKET RECAP</p><p>Nvidia (NVDA) and Mellanox (MLNX) both surged after the former agreed to acquire the latter for USD 6.9bln in cash, outbidding Intel’s (INTC) previous USD 6bln offer. Apple (AAPL) outperformed after BAML turned bullish on the iPhone maker. Boeing (BA) traded with large losses in the wake of the 157-casualty Ethiopian Airlines flight crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8; Southwest Airlines (LUV), whose fleet consists of mainly 737 Max 8s, also sold off. Newmont (NEM) drifted lower on the announcement of its Nevada JV with Barrick Gold (GOLD), with Barrick removing its previous full acquisition offer. Baker Hughes (BHGE), Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and National Oilwell (NOV) were all outperformers following Goldman Sachs initiating the oilfield services sector with Buy ratings, in particular Baker Hughes, which it gave a Conviction Buy rating. Eli Lilly (LLY) sold off, whilst Elanco (ELAN) made gains following Eli Lilly’s completion of its share exchange offer for Elanco. Weyerhaeuser (WY) and Facebook (FB) benefitted from upgrades at BMO Capital and Nomura Instinet respectively. SPX +1.47% at 2783, NDX +2.11% at 7164, DJI +0.79% at 25651.</p><p>The relatively upbeat risk sentiment has seen the Treasury curve steepen slightly (though 2s5s and 2s10s were a touch narrower). Analysts cited Powell’s positive comments on Friday (economy healthy), which contributed to some of the downside, though the main catalyst was likely equities bouncing back despite heavyweight Boeing trading red (see stock specifics). The Treasury sold new 3-year notes today at the lowest yield in a year; but although cover was in line with recent averages, the auction tailed by 0.4bps (average over the last six was 0.2bps tail). There wasn’t too much to take from the internals; indirect takedown rebounded on the month to the highest since December. US T-note futures (M9) settled 4 ticks lower at 122-20+.</p>",

However, there was some chunky downward revisions to the December data, which was already disappointing. Pantheon say the revisions imply a 0.2ppt downward revision to Q4 GDP growth, but say that is not the end of the story: \"The official data are subject to endless further revisions, and we remain of the view that eventually they will be revised higher, in keeping with past experience when the numbers undershoot the Redbook,\" Pantheon said. \"To be clear, we are not arguing here that the true rate of growth of retail sales remains at last year's peak; that can’t happen, given the fading boost from the tax cuts and the drop in gas prices in Q4. But the December plunge probably overstates the downshift substantially.\" Pantheon also says the details of the January report suggest the rebound was uneven, but overall \"these data signal a clear increase in total consumers' spending in January, but the adverse base effect from December's drop - which will be revised down - means that Q1 real consumption will struggle mightily to reach 2% growth, and a mere 1% is entirely possible,\" Pantheon notes.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP 2020 BUDGET:</strong> As expected, the Trump budget proposed spending cuts for Federal Agencies (ex defence, which got a boost). Growth was projected at 3.0% or above over the horizon. Crucially, analysts note that the Budget aims to achieve balanced accounts by 2034 – GOP budgets usually aim to achieve this within a decade, highlighting the deficit-friendly nature of Trump policies. A Bloomberg reporter tweeted that Trump's first budget projected a USD 488bln deficit for fiscal 2020, two years later, his latest budget projects a USD 1.101trln deficit; revenue is USD 337bln less than he had projected (on tax cuts), though spending is USD 276bln higher.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Ahead of this week's series of votes on Brexit, UK PM May is in Strasbourg this evening for last-minute negotiations with EU President Juncker and EU Brexit negotiator Barnier. There is optimism that she will be able to secure concessions that will allow UK AG Cox to change his legal opinion of May's deal, which would make it more palatable to Brexiteers and the DUP (who essentially do not want a permanent backstop arrangement on the Irish border). In terms of the mechanics, there are hopes that the Tusk/Juncker's January letter can be turned into a protocol—which would be legally binding, and would then give Cox ammunition to change his legal advice. The Spectator explained that \"the theory goes that if the backstop were to become permanent, it would contradict the Good Friday Agreement as it would replace North/South cooperation with a UK/EU construct; so, the UK could use this protocol to the withdrawal agreement to justify quitting the backstop if it was clearly becoming permanent.\" May will arrive in Strasbourg at 9pm local time (8pm London time), and a statement is expected. There were some concerns in the day that, if May's deal fails as expected on Tuesday, she could scrap the vote on the Wednesday on a no-deal Brexit, and the vote on Thursday to extend the Article 50 process, though these concerns were dismissed by UK government officials. Back to this week’s votes, as it stands, assuming no additional concessions are secured, the assumption is that May would lose the vote, which would lead to a vote on a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday, and then a vote to extend Article 50 on Thursday. For this evenings events, tonight’s focus is on a unilateral UK statement interpreting temporary nature of backstop to allow Cox to alter his legal advice. Idea is EU will give tacit approval by not objecting, a Sun reporter said. Other reporters have tempered enthusiasm; BBC’s Watt said a Cabinet minister told him that the negotiations in Strasbourg were “not looking good.”</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLES $0.72 HIGHER AT $56.79; BRENT (K9) SETTLES $0.84 HIGHER AT $66.58.</strong> Brent bounced back on Monday after news that Saudi Arabia will extend the production cuts it has already announced for March into April. \"Saudi has been producing below the 10.3mln BPD quota agreed as part of the OPEC+ production cut plan since early this year, and had guided to a production level of 9.8mln BPD in March,\" UBS O&amp;G desk said, \"the latest comment that April production will also be 'well below' 10mln BPD is a positive for oil, but should not come as a surprise.\" The bank explains that the Saudis have consistently shown signs that it intends to tighten the market, and UBS says it will likely continue to do so while concerns about global economic growth, and US/China trade talks weigh on sentiment. \"The 4Q18 oil price collapse likely left Saudi and its OPEC+ allies concerned about how easily the group can lose its grip on oil prices, with the result that there seems now to be widespread acceptance of the idea that ceding market share to defend a higher price is the economically optimal choice,\" UBS added. Ahead of this week’s energy inventories, Genscape reportedly forecasts a draw of 671k barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub.</p><p><strong>* SPX +1.47% at 2783, NDX +2.11% at 7164, DJI +0.79% at 25651.

Apple (AAPL) outperformed after BAML turned bullish on the iPhone maker. Boeing (BA) traded with large losses in the wake of the 157-casualty Ethiopian Airlines flight crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8; Southwest Airlines (LUV), whose fleet consists of mainly 737 Max 8s, also sold off.

Analysts cited Powell’s positive comments on Friday (economy healthy), which contributed to some of the downside, though the main catalyst was likely equities bouncing back despite heavyweight Boeing trading red (see stock specifics). The Treasury sold new 3-year notes today at the lowest yield in a year; but although cover was in line with recent averages, the auction tailed by 0.4bps (average over the last six was 0.2bps tail).

And the recent richening of the 10-year may keep investors side-lined; Barclays notes that on-the-runs are trading more special than older 10s when compared with previous auction cycles, and the bank argues that that suggests a build-up of a short base as the auction sets up. Barclays says it continues to maintain its recommendation to fade the liquidity premium in on-the-runs (the Feb 2029) vs. older 10s (the Aug 2028); “OnTR10s have cheapened 0.5bp in forward space. However, they still appear somewhat rich on the curve, especially if they do not end up trading as special as priced in the repo market.” Six auction averages: <strong>High-yield 2.954%, tail -0.2bps, cover 2.45x, dealers 25.8%, directs 10.6%, indirects 63.6%.</strong></p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Brexit was the top performer in G10 FX with hopes rising that the UK and EU are on the cusp of a breakthrough that would allow UK Attorney General Cox to change his legal pinion of the irish backstop, and win support of Brexiteers and the DUP to support May’s deal on Tuesday. GBP has found its way to the 1.3150 ahead of comments from May/Juncker later tonight. Assuming that nothing changes (and May does not secure further concessions), there are four scenarios for GBP and tomorrow’s vote, Barclays bank says. SCENARIO 1: Meaningful Vote fails (Tue)/no-deal blocked (Wed)/vote to extend A50 passes (Thu) (scenario is mostly likely, as things stand, without further concessions); Barclays says initial GBP reaction would be negative. Focus will then shift to 21 March summit, where any signs of a longer extension could lead to a rally. SCENARIO 2: Meaningful Vote passes (somewhat likely); Barclays says it could open the door for new post-referendum highs. SCENARIO 3: All votes fail (unlikely); Barclays sees GBP real effective exchange rate -2.5% as markets price higher probability of no-deal Brexit. Focus then shifts to 21 March summit where GBP will be almost entirely sensitive to Brexit newsflow. GBP SCENARIO 4: meaningful vote fails/MPs vote for no-deal (highly unlikely); Barclays says GBP REER -5%.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The DXY is slightly negative, while the EUR and JPY are more or less flat; the DXY was a function of data; the Jan data surprised to the upside, but December’s grim print was revised down further, seeing the USD sell-off, before stabilising around the cash open. US CPI is on the slate for Tuesday, though it is likely that both today’s data does little to change Fed pricing, and ahead of the inflation data tomorrow, it would likely take more than one decent print to put the Fed back onto its hiking trajectory.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> For the EUR, analysts note that the narrowing of the Bund/BTP spread and Bund/Treasury spread should be supportive of the EUR, though that is not being seen, likely due to the fact that the currency is pro-cyclical, and concerns about global growth (and specifically, Eurozone growth, as evidenced by the ECB last week) is keeping a lid on action. Additionally, SocGen believes that despite the narrowing in rate differentials, we’d still need to see Bund yields tick up for the EUR to catch any meaningful lift.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Dollar-yen was heading south after the European session got underway, though as US equities opened firmer, the haven was sold after finding a floor around 111.00, rising to highs around 111.30. Analysts said the it was typical BTD activity, though the 100- and 200-dma (at 111.34 and 111.41 respectively) seem to be capping upside.&nbsp;</p>",

We are being promised billions of additional pounds for schools and the police if deal goes through. Some will buckle. But enough of us are focused on the more important question of whether we'll still be in the backstop in five years\". What also matters is that the Brexiters of the ERG are committed to vote with Northern Ireland's DUP if they continue to believe the union is threatened by the backstop. But if DUP decides in the end to vote with the PM - which, truthfully, looks unlikely - that does not mean the Tory ERG Brexiters will do the same. The relationship between ERG and DUP is asymmetrical in that sense.\"&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1105183804384268288\">Via ITV's Peston</a></li></ul>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Ahead of this week's series of votes on Brexit, UK PM May is in Strasbourg this evening for last-minute negotiations with EU President Juncker and EU Brexit negotiator Barnier. There is optimism that she will be able to secure concessions that will allow UK AG Cox to change his legal opinion of May's deal, which would make it more palatable to Brexiteers and the DUP (who essentially want to see that the UK is not locked-in to the Irish backstop for a long, undetermined amount of time). In terms of the mechanics, there are hopes that the Tusk/Juncker's January letter can be turned into a protocol—which would be legally binding, which would then give Cox to change his legal advice. The Spectator explained that \"the theory goes that if the backstop were to become permanent, it would contradict the Good Friday Agreement as it would replace North/South cooperation with a UK/EU construct; so, the UK could use this protocol to the withdrawal agreement to justify quitting the backstop if it was clearly becoming permanent.\" May will arrive in Strasbourg at 9pm local time (8pm London time), and a statement is expected. There were some concerns in the day that, if May's deal fails as expected on Tuesday, she could scrap the vote on teh Wednesday on a no-deal Brexit, and the vote on Thursday to extend the Article 50 process, though these concerns were dismissed by UK government officials.&nbsp;</li><li>Note: we published <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-brexit-breifing-the-state-of-play-ahead-of-tuesday-s-meaningful-vote-10-03-2019\">this situation report yesterday </a>highlighting the key themes ahead of Tuesday's Brexit vote.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

No Fed add-ons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECENT PERFORMANCE: </strong>The uncertain outlook, risk asset jitters, and the prospect of no Fed hikes on the horizon has supported front-end of the Treasury curve recently; the market prices no hikes this year, with pricing tilting towards cuts in 2020. TD Securities expects this week's auctions to go well given their expectation for no further coupon auction size increases ahead, and the fact that rates have remained relatively stable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION (USD 38bln, Monday 1300 EDT/1700 GMT): </strong>The previous 3-year auction was solid, extending the run of lower stop-out rates at 3s auctions to four at 2.502%, stopping-through for the first time in 11-months. Dealer participation was the lowest since early 2018, offset by firm domestic investor demand. Barclays notes: “The new 3y note will be eligible for inclusion in the TUM0 deliverable basket and is a potential CTD candidate. The security will be the shortest maturity alongside the current seasoned 5y note (1.875s of Mar22s) and a future 2y Mar22 note. We believe the 3y WI is appropriately rich relative to current 3s.” Six auction averages: High-yield 2.767%, tail 0.2bps, cover 2.56x, dealers 41%, directs 12%, indirects 47%.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/6d4101c8-8875-4a7a-8d70-60373154d675.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/NOK</strong></p><p>Still the G10 outliers, but now both in the ascendency and outperforming as the Pound rebounds sharply and impressively on renewed hopes that UK PM May can salvage a deal with the EU that might sway Tuesday’s meaningful vote in her favour. After the latest rounds of talks and negotiations, the EU offered a compromise on the backstop that is said by Brussels to have been close to bridging the gap between the 2 sides, but then rejected by UK Government. However, May and Juncker have spoken again by phone since and rumours are circulating, although not confirmed that the former could be heading to Strasbourg to receive another alternative offer which could break the deadlock. Some are also suggesting that Barnier will be in attendance, adding more momentum to the 11th hour Brexit deal bandwagon, with Cable building on recovery gains above 1.3000 and only stalling a few pips from 1.3100 vs a low of around 1.2950 at one stage, and Eur/Gbp extending its retreat from 0.8675 highs to sub-0.8600. Note, this puts a big bank trade recommendation back in the money as it shorted the cross at 0.8630, looking for 0.8400 and with a stop at 0.8730. All eyes/ears now turning to Brexit Minister Barclay standing in for PM May. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Krona held the bulk of its inflation data gains on the 9.7600 handle vs just over 9.8260 before the much firmer than expected headline and core CPI prints that underscored Norges Bank rate hike expectations for next Thursday.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The next best majors and both clawing back a bit more lost ground vs their US rival after eagerly awaited US retail sales data for January flattered to deceive with better than anticipated headline prints somewhat sullied by downward revisions to the previous month that was already grim. The Kiwi maintained its dominance down under and hit 0.6835 at best, while the Aussie managed to climb above 0.7050 to reach 0.7065, but could not cross 1.0350 vs the Nzd.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>Both ending pretty muted Monday EU sessions just a shade firmer vs the Greenback, with the single currency still anchored around 1.1250 and flanked by tech levels and options either side within a broader 1.1200-1.1300 range (like a 1.1270 Fib, 1.1200 and 1.1300-20 expiries in 1.7 bn and 2.7 bn respectively). Meanwhile, aside from the aforementioned post-data Usd dip, which saw the DXY slip just below 97.200 at worst, the Loonie derived some momentum from an upturn in oil prices after a Saudi Arabian official indicated sub-7 mn bpd exports in April. Note, Usd/Cad recoiled a bit further from last week’s peak to probe under 1.3400 before consolidating just above the big figure again.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major laggards as broad risk sentiment stabilised and the Jpy retreated towards 111.30 lows vs around 110.90 at the other end of the spectrum, while the Franc touched 1.0100 again from 1.0070 as Eur/Chf held between 1.1315 and 1.1355 approximately.</p>",

It makes sense that they are now underestimating the negative impact that will have on behavior like capital spending, which we think is the next major area of disappointment.\"</li><li>MS says the most recent earnings season was unusual in that, on average, companies lowering guidance tended to move higher both immediately following the guidance revisions and over the next few days. \"We think this kind of 'dip buying' on guidance signals confidence in a trough, but wearen't as sure,\" and notes that \"the last time the market saw guidance dips being bought in this way was around guides for 1Q15, a period which ultimately did not reflect the trough for earnings revisions.</li></ul>",

However, there was some chunky downward revisions to the December data, which was already disappointing. Pantheon say the revisions imply a 0.2ppt downward revision to Q4 GDP growth, but say that is not the end of the story: \"The official data are subject to endless further revisions, and we remain of the view that eventually they will be revised higher, in keeping with past experience when the numbers undershoot the Redbook,\" Pantheon said. \"To be clear, we are not arguing here that the true rate of growth of retail sales remains at last year's peak; that can’t happen, given the fading boost from the tax cuts and the drop in gas prices in Q4. But the December plunge probably overstates the downshift substantially.\" Pantheon also says the details of the January report suggest the rebound was uneven, but overall \"these data signal a clear increase in total consumers' spending in January, but the adverse base effect from December's drop - which will be revised down - means that Q1 real consumption will struggle mightily to reach 2% growth, and a mere 1% is entirely possible,\" Pantheon notes.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>US President Trump will release the 2020 budget on Monday (comes into effect in October), and set up a clash with Congress. The requests are a signalling exercise; it is Congress that sets the budget numbers, and Trump’s budget won’t get very far. But it will set up election themes, and also raise concerns of another government shutdown when current funding runs out at the end of September, if Trump threatens to veto any spending plan that falls short of his request.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRUMP TO REQUEST USD 8.6BLN OF FUNDING FOR BORDER WALL: </strong>That would be more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the last two fiscal years, Reuters reported; the request will not likely get through the Democrat-controlled House. Nevertheless, the request and likely rejection sets up the issue of border security for the 2020 Presidential Campaign, where ‘Finish the Wall’ catchphrase may gain more prominence.</p><p><strong>* DEFENCE SPENDING EXPECTED TO BE BOOSTED:</strong> Specifically, the funding will be requested through a boost to the Pentagon’s Overseas Contingency Operations (aka the War Fund). It’s a way to increase military spending without raising caps that were set in 2011. The move is essentially aimed at increasing defence spending without reaching a deal with Democrats to raise domestic spending, The Hill explains. As part of the request, Trump will reportedly seek funding for a new Space Force, branched within the Air Force.</p><p><strong>* DOMESTIC SPENDING CUTS:</strong> The White House has proposed a 5% spending cut across Federal Agencies, with the exception of the Defence budget. Trump previously proposed spending cuts on domestic programs have largely been ignored by Congress. Democrats are likely to give Trump fierce resistance to proposed cuts in education, health and environmental protections, CNN reported.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FORECASTS:</strong> The economic projections will likely pencil in growth above 3%, and will likely propose taking longer to balance the books than Republicans have advocated in the past, Politico reported. (exp. 3.2% in 2019, 3.1% in 2020, 3% in 2021, 2.8% in 2026, and a 10-year forecast of 3.0%; the proposal will reportedly see a balanced budget in 2034, rather than the typical 10-year horizon that has been a goal for Republicans).</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS - BREXIT BREIFING: The state of play ahead of Tuesday's Meaningful vote",
        "content": "<p><strong>* MAY FACING DEFEAT:</strong> UK PM May will on Tuesday likely lose her second Brexit Meaningful Vote by a margin greater than the 230 seen at January's first Meaningful Vote, according to the Sunday Times, and even \"optimists\" are said to see a majority of 150 against her deal. Cabinet members issued familiar warnings about how Brexit might not happen at all if they fail to back May’s deal.</p><p><strong>* MAY UNDER PRESSURE TO QUIT:</strong> May could yet secure the support of Brexiteers in her own party if she pledged to step down by June so that a new Prime Minister can lead the next round of negotiations with the EU, the Sunday Times said. One aide was said to have predicted that if Labour tabled another motion of no confidence in the Government, Tories might vote for it to bring May down.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S VOTES:</strong> To avoid humiliation, plans are reportedly being drawn-up to offer lawmakers the chance to vote on a motion that would outline the deal it would like, in order to show the EU what terms could be acceptable to Parliament. There is also a possibility that if the Meaningful Vote is rejected on Tuesday, planned votes on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit and whether to extend Article 50 could be scrapped so May can attempt once more to try and secure concessions from the EU at the 21 March EU summit, The Times added.</p><p><strong>* AWAITING ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OPINION: </strong>Passage of the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) likely will require Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to issue a legal opinion – expected late Sunday or early Monday – that the ‘Backstop’ is not legally binding indefinitely and the DUP and ERG to support his finding, Barclays explains. That seems very improbable, and accordingly, May’s deal is likely to suffer defeat.</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 1: Meaningful Vote fails (Tue)/no-deal blocked (Wed/Thu)/vote to extend A50 passes (Wed/Thu) (likely).</strong> Barclays says initial GBP reaction would be negative. Focus will then shift to 21 March summit, where any signs of a longer extension could lead to a rally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 2: Meaningful Vote passes (somewhat likely).</strong> Barclays says it could open the door for new post-referendum highs.</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 3: All votes fail (unlikely).</strong> Barclays sees GBP real effective exchange rate -2.5% as markets price higher probability of no-deal Brexit. Focus then shifts to 21 March summit where GBP will be almost entirely sensitive to Brexit newsflow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP SCENARIO 4: meaningful vote fails/MPs vote for no-deal (highly unlikely):</strong> Barclays says GBP REER -5%.</p><p><strong>* POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?:</strong> If MPs vote to extend the Article 50 process, in addition to the UK’s approval, every EU member would be required to agree. The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to <strong>18 April</strong> – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to <strong>23 May</strong> has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit become possible. A push to the end of <strong>June – 23rd </strong>is capturing imagines since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in <strong>early July</strong>, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.</p><p><strong>* NORWAY STYLE:</strong> Meanwhile cross-party pro-EU lawmakers are said to be drawing up a new Brexit political declaration that commits the UK to a Norway style relationship with the EU, which could be tabled if May loses Tuesday's vote. And on the government side, Chancellor Philip Hammond is reportedly preparing a GBP 20bln 'bribe' in his budget, if May's deal is carried on Tuesday; the Chancellor had previously warned of a return to austerity if May's plans are rejected.</p><p><strong>* NAMES IN THE FRAME TO REPLACE MAY:</strong> The four leading names to succeed May: current Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, current Home Secretary Sajid Javid, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>After opening with gains of around 0.5%, major European indices are largely unchanged [Eurostoxx 50 +0.1%] following an indecisive lead from Asia where Chinese stocks eventually outperformed. Goldman Sachs noted that China A shares could be set for large gains as “fear of missing out” takes hold. If retail optimism were to return to its peaks in 2015 and 2018, the CSI 300 would give approximately 50% and 15% potential upside respectively from current levels, Goldman says. Equities across Europe have somewhat waned off opening highs with the FTSE 100 (+0.8%) holding its composure amid a weak domestic currency ahead of a series of Parliamentary votes this week. Meanwhile, Spain’s IBEX (-0.1%) underperforms as heavyweight BBVA (Unch) swings between gains and losses amid reports the Co. is planning board changes in the coming months. Over in Germany, Wirecard (+5.6%) shares lift the benchmark as the Co. expects the final report on fraud allegations soon (Note: Shorting ban on Co shares are still ongoing). Deutsche Bank (+2.2%) also supports the German index amid pre-market reports that the Co. and Commerzbank (+4.6%) have begun tentative merger talks. Finally, Dow Jones Mar’19 futures dipped lower as Boeing shares dropped 10% in pre-market trade following the weekend Boeing 737 Max 8 crash on its way to Nairobi, marking the second disaster for the jet in five months. Several airlines have since grounded the Boeing jet, whilst Airbus shares (+0.4%) are little moved.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP –</strong> Sterling remains under pressure across the board, irrespective of latest bullish bank calls (this time via Eur/Gbp rather than Cable), as talks between UK and EU officials on changes to the back-stop continue to hit a brick wall, and the prospects of a breakthrough looks increasingly bleak before Tuesday’s meaningful vote. Indeed, given the ongoing impasse and indications that PM May’s deal will be roundly rejected again, rumours are now circulating about a provisional or conditional vote before going back to Parliament, and with the possibility of adding the Cox amendment to try and coerce more support. Cable briefly reclaimed 1.3000+ status amidst reports that the EU will not demand more money from Britain in exchange for an extension to the March 29 Article 50 deadline, in contrast to earlier suggestions, but is back below the round number and not far from circa 1.2950 lows hit when stops were said to have been tripped around the 1.2960 level (trend-line support). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp is hugging the top of a 0.8675-40 range, leaving the aforementioned short strategy underwater at this stage, as the institution entered at 0.8630 with a 0.8760 stop and 0.8400 target.</p><p><strong>NOK –</strong> The Norwegian Crown is also bucking an otherwise relatively muted and rangebound start to the week for G10 currencies/pairings, but outperforming in wake of significantly stronger than forecast CPI data, and especially the core inflation measure. Eur/Nok fell from 9.8250+ to just shy of 9.7600 in response, but is currently holding near 9.7700.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/AUD/CAD/JPY/CHF –</strong>&nbsp; All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the single currency reclaiming some lost ground after its sharp post-ECB demise, but struggling to sustain recovery gains much beyond 1.1250 with resistance seen at 1.1270 (Fib level) and 1.1298, while hefty options may also keep Eur/Usd in check given 2.7 bn sitting between 1.1300-20 and not much on the downside until 1.7 bn at the 1.1200 strike. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is still performing better than the Aussie down under, partly due to post-NFP weakness in its US counterpart and switching via the Aud/Nzd cross that is pivoting 1.0350. Consequently, Nzd/Usd is hovering just above 0.6800, while Aud/Usd is capped circa 0.7050. Elsewhere, the Loonie continues to benefit from upbeat Canadian jobs data in contrast to the headline US tally, and firmer crude prices to an extent, as Usd/Cad eases back from recent 1.3460 highs. Turning to Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf, both are nearer the apex of respective 111.30-110.90 and 1.0095-70 trading parameters, as the broad Dollar and DXY regain some composure – index meandering between 97.500-250.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The ongoing malaise and heightened uncertainty on the eve of what could well be 3 consecutive and pivotal Parliamentary votes on the fate of Brexit has underpinned UK debt, albeit belatedly, as Gilts grind higher to reach a new 127.39 Liffe peak for the day (+26 ticks). Meanwhile, Bunds have also regained composure after a deeper retreat from best levels to 164.32 at one stage (-7 ticks), and another sell-off in Italian bonds could well be supporting the 10 year Eurozone benchmark. However, US Treasuries are not that impressed as futures remain depressed and the curve steeper in wake of latest comments from Fed chair Powell reiterating an upbeat assessment of the economy, but no rush to hike rates again. Note also, key retail sales data on tap later, and Usd38 bn 3 year supply.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are trading with firm gains of around USD 0.50/bbl each with recent upside exacerbated by comments from a Saudi Official which stated that the Kingdom plans to cut April crude exports below 7mln BPD. This follows comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih last week who noted that the Kingdom is currently exporting around 7-8mln BPD of crude. Furthermore, the Official stated that Saudi are to keep oil production in April well below 10mln BPD, compared with February’s output of 10.316mln BPD; according to Industry sources. In the metals complex, <strong>spot gold </strong>remains sub-1300/oz as the yellow metal is largely dictated by USD-action. RBC notes that gold may still be “well off its YTD highs” although they caveat this by stating “[they] remain of the view that macro headwinds have softened”.

Goldman Sachs noted that China A shares could be set for large gains as “fear of missing out” takes hold. If retail optimism were to return to its peaks in 2015 and 2018, the CSI 300 would give approximately 50% and 15% potential upside respectively from current levels, Goldman says. Equities across Europe have somewhat waned off opening highs with the <strong>FTSE 100 (+0.8%)</strong> holding its composure amid a weak domestic currency ahead of a series of Parliamentary votes this week. Meanwhile, Spain’s <strong>IBEX (-0.1%)</strong> underperforms as heavyweight BBVA (Unch) swings between gains and losses amid reports the Co. is planning board changes in the coming months. Over in Germany, Wirecard (+5.6%) shares lift the benchmark as the Co. expects the final report on fraud allegations soon (Note: Shorting ban on Co shares are still ongoing). Deutsche Bank (+2.2%) also supports the German index amid pre-market reports that the Co. and Commerzbank (+4.6%) have begun tentative merger talks. Finally, <strong>Dow Jones Mar’19 futures dipped lower as Boeing shares dropped 10% in pre-market trade</strong> following the weekend Boeing 737 Max 8 crash on its way to Nairobi, marking the second disaster for the jet in five months. Several airlines have since grounded the Boeing jet, whilst Airbus shares (+0.4%) are little moved.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - Sterling remains under pressure across the board, irrespective of latest bullish bank calls (this time via Eur/Gbp rather than Cable), as talks between UK and EU officials on changes to the back-stop continue to hit a brick wall, and the prospects of a breakthrough looks increasingly bleak before Tuesday’s meaningful vote. Indeed, given the ongoing impasse and indications that PM May’s deal will be roundly rejected again, rumours are now circulating about a provisional or conditional vote before going back to Parliament, and with the possibility of adding the Cox amendment to try and coerce more support. Cable briefly reclaimed 1.3000+ status amidst reports that the EU will not demand more money from Britain in exchange for an extension to the March 29 Article 50 deadline, in contrast to earlier suggestions, but is back below the round number and not far from circa 1.2950 lows hit when stops were said to have been tripped around the 1.2960 level (trend-line support). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp is hugging the top of a 0.8675-40 range, leaving the aforementioned short strategy underwater at this stage, as the institution entered at 0.8630 with a 0.8760 stop and 0.8400 target.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong> - The Norwegian Crown is also bucking an otherwise relatively muted and rangebound start to the week for G10 currencies/pairings, but outperforming in wake of significantly stronger than forecast CPI data, and especially the core inflation measure. Eur/Nok fell from 9.8250+ to just shy of 9.7600 in response, but is currently holding near 9.7700.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/AUD/CAD/JPY/CHF</strong> - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the single currency reclaiming some lost ground after its sharp post-ECB demise, but struggling to sustain recovery gains much beyond 1.1250 with resistance seen at 1.1270 (Fib level) and 1.1298, while hefty options may also keep Eur/Usd in check given 2.7 bn sitting between 1.1300-20 and not much on the downside until 1.7 bn at the 1.1200 strike. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is still performing better than the Aussie down under, partly due to post-NFP weakness in its US counterpart and switching via the Aud/Nzd cross that is pivoting 1.0350. Consequently, Nzd/Usd is hovering just above 0.6800, while Aud/Usd is capped circa 0.7050. Elsewhere, the Loonie continues to benefit from upbeat Canadian jobs data in contrast to the headline US tally, and firmer crude prices to an extent, as Usd/Cad eases back from recent 1.3460 highs. Turning to Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf, both are nearer the apex of respective 111.30-110.90 and 1.0095-70 trading parameters, as the broad Dollar and DXY regain some composure – index meandering between 97.500-250.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The ongoing malaise and heightened uncertainty on the eve of what could well be 3 consecutive and pivotal Parliamentary votes on the fate of Brexit has underpinned UK debt, albeit belatedly, as Gilts grind higher to reach a new 127.39 Liffe peak for the day (+26 ticks). Meanwhile, Bunds have also regained composure after a deeper retreat from best levels to 164.32 at one stage (-7 ticks), and another sell-off in Italian bonds could well be supporting the 10 year Eurozone benchmark. However, US Treasuries are not that impressed as futures remain depressed and the curve steeper in wake of latest comments from Fed chair Powell reiterating an upbeat assessment of the economy, but no rush to hike rates again. Note also, key retail sales data on tap later, and Usd38 bn 3 year supply.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are trading with firm gains of around USD 0.50/bbl each with recent upside exacerbated by comments from a Saudi Official which stated that the Kingdom plans to cut April crude exports below 7mln BPD. This follows comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih last week who noted that the Kingdom is currently exporting around 7-8mln BPD of crude. Furthermore, the Official stated that Saudi are to keep oil production in April well below 10mln BPD, compared with February’s output of 10.316mln BPD; according to Industry sources. In the metals complex, <strong>spot gold </strong>remains sub-1300/oz as the yellow metal is largely dictated by USD-action. RBC notes that gold may still be “well off its YTD highs” although they caveat this by stating “[they] remain of the view that macro headwinds have softened”. The bank also reiterated their 2019 annual average price forecast at USD 1338/oz, and launched a 2020 forecast at USD 1367/oz. Elsewhere, <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> prices fell as much as 3.6%, hitting the lowest levels for this month so far as demand waned due to restrictions on steel productions.</p>",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: Pound undermined by Brexit deadlock, Norwegian Crown underpinned by CPI",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling remains under pressure across the board, irrespective of latest bullish bank calls (this time via Eur/Gbp rather than Cable), as talks between UK and EU officials on changes to the back-stop continue to hit a brick wall, and the prospects of a breakthrough looks increasingly bleak before Tuesday’s meaningful vote. Indeed, given the ongoing impasse and indications that PM May’s deal will be roundly rejected again, rumours are now circulating about a provisional or conditional vote before going back to Parliament, and with the possibility of adding the Cox amendment to try and coerce more support. Cable briefly reclaimed 1.3000+ status amidst reports that the EU will not demand more money from Britain in exchange for an extension to the March 29 Article 50 deadline, in contrast to earlier suggestions, but is back below the round number and not far from circa 1.2950 lows hit when stops were said to have been tripped around the 1.2960 level (trend-line support). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp is hugging the top of a 0.8675-40 range, leaving the aforementioned short strategy underwater at this stage, as the institution entered at 0.8630 with a 0.8760 stop and 0.8400 target.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown is also bucking an otherwise relatively muted and rangebound start to the week for G10 currencies/pairings, but outperforming in wake of significantly stronger than forecast CPI data, and especially the core inflation measure. Eur/Nok fell from 9.8250+ to just shy of 9.7600 in response, but is currently holding near 9.7700.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/AUD/CAD/JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the single currency reclaiming some lost ground after its sharp post-ECB demise, but struggling to sustain recovery gains much beyond 1.1250 with resistance seen at 1.1270 (Fib level) and 1.1298, while hefty options may also keep Eur/Usd in check given 2.7 bn sitting between 1.1300-20 and not much on the downside until 1.7 bn at the 1.1200 strike. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is still performing better than the Aussie down under, partly due to post-NFP weakness in its US counterpart and switching via the Aud/Nzd cross that is pivoting 1.0350. Consequently, Nzd/Usd is hovering just above 0.6800, while Aud/Usd is capped circa 0.7050. Elsewhere, the Loonie continues to benefit from upbeat Canadian jobs data in contrast to the headline US tally, and firmer crude prices to an extent, as Usd/Cad eases back from recent 1.3460 highs. Turning to Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf, both are nearer the apex of respective 111.30-110.90 and 1.0095-70 trading parameters, as the broad Dollar and DXY regain some composure – index meandering between 97.500-250.</p>",

Similarly, Short Sterling contracts are now flat to 1.5 ticks firmer vs -0.5 to +0.5 tick earlier, awaiting any further Brexit news from ongoing negotiations with EU officials ahead of tomorrow’s meaningful vote that looks doomed to failure again, in its current guise. Indeed, more speculation that PM May could delay putting the deal to Parliament for the 2nd time or hold a conditional vote to test the water first, but on a more positive note EU sources have denied reports that the UK could be made to pay more for any extension. In terms of scheduled events, no domestic data slated, but inflation expectations are flagged on some calendars and BoE’s Haskel is due to speak.</p>",

The composure of the greenback and indecisive risk tone kept price action across most major currencies range-bound in which <strong>USD/JPY </strong>oscillated around the 111.00 level and with antipodeans tentative after a slowdown in lending and mixed inflation data from China, while <strong>EUR/USD</strong> was little changed at the 1.1200 handle amid light weekend news flow from the continent although Barclays had recommended shorting <strong>EUR/GBP</strong> with a target at 0.8400 and stop at 0.8760. Conversely, <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was the underperformer on several bearish Brexit-related stories including reports which suggested that only 2 cabinet members still support PM May and that she was warned by MPs to put the Brexit vote on hold, while the EU is also said to be preparing to impose punitive conditions on the UK including a higher divorce bill if the latter requests a Brexit extension.

The composure of the greenback and indecisive risk tone has kept price action across most major currencies range-bound with USD/JPY oscillating around the 111.00 level and with antipodeans also tentative after a slowdown in lending and mixed inflation data from China, while EUR/USD is little changed at the 1.1200 handle amid light weekend news flow from the continent although Barclays does recommend shorting EUR/GBP with a target at 0.8400 and stop at 0.8760. Conversely, GBP/USD is the underperformer on several bearish related stories including reports which suggested that only 2 cabinet members still support PM May and that she was warned by MPs to put the Brexit vote on hold, while the EU is also said to be preparing to impose punitive conditions on the UK including a higher divorce bill if the latter requests a Brexit extension.
