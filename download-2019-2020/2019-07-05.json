ES futures dropped by around 20 points in pre-cash open trade, but gradually recovered over the course of the session (though it is worth noting that trade feels thin, with many players still out after Thursday’s 4th July market holiday); cash equities did not, however, print any record highs, though remains within a few points of a new record. Yields rose across the curve in a bear-flattening fashion, and the T-Note future is just off lows going into the weekend. The Buck had a stormer, with the DXY smashing through the 100dma and 50dma, and trades just above the latter as we go into the weekend. Next week features a heavy slate of Fedspeak, as well as the US CPI report, which will help to further colour rate expectations.</p><p><strong>* US JOBS REPORT:</strong> The headline beat to the upside at 224k, eclipsing the consensus 160k, and printing more than the most optimistic forecast. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, although the participation rate also ticked higher. Wage growth missed expectations slightly (+0.2% M/M against an expected +0.3%, though the Y/Y remained unchanged at 3.1%). Manufacturing employment rose by 17k, suggesting that the surveys for June may have been overly gloomy. The average pace of payroll growth has edged to around 170k (over a three-, six-, and 12-month basis), Capital Economics notes, and says that this is much stronger than levels that have usually prompted the Fed to cut rates in the past (the consultancy is in the minority thinking the Fed will leave rates unchanged in July, but sees the next move lower in September).</p><p><strong>* FED MONETARY POLICY REPORT: </strong>The Fed’s semi-annual monetary policy report, released ahead of Chair Powell’s dual-testimony next week, did not shake the boat to much; it repeated that the central bank will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. On inflation, it stated that soft inflation readings appear to reflect transitory influences, a line Powell took at the post meeting press conference earlier in the year. The Fed said that data suggested a moderation in Q2 GDP was on the cards due to weak business investment, which appears to have decelerated sharply in 2019, and a slowdown in global trade flows (both of these factors have been cited by the Fed previously), and US and global tariffs have been material to the slowdown in international trade. Asset valuation remains \"somewhat elevated\", the Fed said, noting the rapid rise in business borrowing; however, it said that, overall, the financial system is resilient. On the consumer, the central bank said sentiment remains strong, and household borrowing conditions remain generally favourable.</p><p><strong>* FED BOARD NOMINEE SHELTON: </strong>Trump's Board of Governors nominee Judy Shelton said today's jobs report shows that the Trump agenda is working. She argued that the Fed should not 'pull the rug' from under the market, and that markets were not wrong in questioning the yield curve. She also echoed Trump's comments on ECB looking to devalue the EUR, and said competitive devaluation is 'cheating, not competing'. Generally, Shelton did nothing to lean-back against the notion she is a political appointee, and echoed the Trumpian line.</p><p><strong>* CANADA JOBS REPORT: </strong>Employment fell by 2k vs consensus expectations for a rise of 10k, the unemployment rate rose by one-tenth to 5.5%, although Y/Y wage growth jumped to 3.8% from 2.8%. The small fall in June employment does nothing to alter the view that the Canadian labour market is relatively solid, RBC said, noting that employment is still up 421k in the last 12 months, and participation is still sitting around all-time highs. RBC is, however, taking the wage surge with a grain of salt, arguing that it is a volatile component. “Still, other wage measures have also shown signs of ticking al little higher in Q2,” RBC says, and “recent readings provide perhaps some reason for optimism that underlying wage trends are picking up to the 3% or higher rate that we would normally expect at this point of the cycle.” RBC adds that, in any case, “the labour market data will only reinforce the expectation that the BOC will not follow the US Fed with what are now widely-expected rate cuts.”</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 25 TICKS LOWER AT 127-15: </strong>US yields rose sharply after the June employment situation report surprised to the upside, and the internals of the report also provided encouragement that the labour market is in decent shape. Bear-flattening was the play after the data, and there was a significant paring back in the implied probabilities of a 50bps rate cut at the Fed’s July meeting – the probability has now fallen to just 0.5% from around 27% before the data, though the market is still completely priced for a 25bps cut; money markets now price 60bps of easing through the end of the year, compared to 75bps at the close of business on Thursday. Interestingly, Treasuries only marginally recovered from lows, despite equities paring back the NFP-induced slide.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.17 HIGHER AT USD 57.51; BRENT (U9) SETTLES 0.93 HIGHER AT USD 64.23: </strong>Crude markets have rebounded in line with equities, shrugging-off downside seen after the consensus beating NFP figure. In terms of energy specific updates, Saudi Arabia reportedly produced 9.8mln BPD in June vs. 9.7mln BPD in May, which although is a slight rise, remains comfortably below the OPEC+ commitment of 10.3mln BPD, further solidifying OPEC’s largest producer as a dedicated signatory of the deal. Citigroup’s analysts note that ongoing geopolitical tensions (Iran) remain a tailwind, but nothing too material had changed when the bank suggested that, although since then the US has requested an emergency IAEA meeting over Iran, and Gibraltar AG announced he had obtained an order to extend the holding of the Iranian tanker seized for 14 additional days (something that will most likely aggravate Iran).</p><p><strong>SPX -0.2% at 2991, NDX -0.2% at 7841, DJI -0.2% at 26923; </strong>SECTORS: Communication +0.0%, consumer discretionary +0.1%, consumer staples -0.5%, energy +0.1%, financials +0.4%, health care -0.7%, industrials -0.5%, IT -0.2%, materials -0.5%, telecoms +0.2%, utilities -0.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Following the rise in rates on the back of the strong payrolls report, financials were the only sector which traded comfortably in the green for most of the session; on the flip side, capital intensive sectors such as utilities, industrials, and materials were lagers. Electronic Arts (EA) was an underperformer amid participants citing ongoing concerns for its once-praised video game Apex Legends. Semiconductors were under pressure throughout the day following Samsung posting guidance for a slowdown in Q2 as trade wars seep through to its business. The stronger dollar saw gold prices tumbling, which fed through to the miners such as Newmont (NEM), Barrick Gold (GOLD), and Kirkland Lake (KL). A slide in Chinese iron ore prices saw a dip in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Nucor (NUE).</p><p><strong>* FX WEEKLY WRAP: USD: </strong>Back with a bang from Independence Day, as a bumper US payroll gain boosts the Dollar across the board and shifts market expectations for the end of month FOMC meeting markedly. In sum, after a string of mixed to weak data and survey releases the return to 200k+ jobs growth more than overshadowed softer than forecast average earnings and an unexpected uptick in the unemployment rate, as labour force participation also edged higher. The DXY cleared 97.000 and resistance just above in response before setting sights on the 50 DMA at 97.270 and beyond to expose 97.500 and 97.766 ahead of the Fed’s MPR and Chair Powell’s twin testimonies next week.</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> Friday’s fall guy and a hefty loser over the week as RBNZ policy perceptions remain dovish amidst a further deterioration in NZ business sentiment and a call for two more OCR cuts this year. The Kiwi is over 100 pips off highs and looking precarious just above 0.6600, while the AUD/Nzd cross is eyeing 1.0550 as the Aussie continues to benefit to an extent from short covering in wake of the back-to-back RBA easing earlier this week. To recap, following a 2nd and widely anticipated 25bp reduction to a fresh all time low of 1%, the accompanying statement and subsequent comments from Governor signalled a shift in stance to wait-and-see mode given the ½ point loosening delivered and fiscal boost via the Government’s big tax cut package. Note, Aud/Usd has lost grip of the 0.7000 handle again, but is off worst levels after testing big barrier defences/offers at 0.7050 at one stage.</p><p><strong>* CHF, JPY:</strong> Also on course to end the week at worst levels or new lows vs the Greenback, as the Franc falls through 0.9900 vs circa 0.9764 at the other extreme and Yen trades at weakest levels for July so far near 108.60 compared to 107.54 at best. NFP aside, both safe-havens have been subject to swings in broad risk sentiment, at various times and not in unison, but also dovish SNB and BoJ vibes.</p><p><strong>* EUR, GBP:</strong> Somewhat mixed independent impulses for the single currency as Eurozone manufacturing PMIs revealed more pronounced weakness and/or contraction, while German data and industry outlooks continued to disappoint vs better news from the services sector overall and Italy managing to get off the EU’s EDP hook. However, Eur/Usd is down near 1.1200 vs circa 1.1375 at the high on the aforementioned Greenback revival and repricing of Fed rate expectations (-50 bp in July now assigned less than 10% probability vs 25%+ pre-NFP) and increasingly dovish ECB perceptions based on recent rhetoric and the nomination of IMF head Lagarde to take over from President Draghi. Meanwhile, ongoing political/Brexit uncertainty and the risk of no deal continued to undermine Sterling, but Cable’s steeper declines below 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp’s rebound towards 0.9000 and late June peaks came on the back of a dovish/downbeat twist from BoE Governor Carney plus a dismal trio of UK PMIs that prompted IHS/Markit to predict -0.1% Q2 GDP, ahead of next week’s monthly report for May from the ONS.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> A choppy week for the Loonie between 1.3145-3035 parameters, with Usd/Cad trading at lows after contrasting Canadian and US trade balances (former revealing a small, but surprise surplus vs latter showing a wider than consensus deficit) before the tables turned on jobs data even though Canada’s labour report was better than the headline figure suggested. Indeed, permanent placements rose and wages were strong heading into the BoC policy meeting, so the Bank could well play down the mildly negative net tally as a temporary blip.</p><p><strong>* NOK, SEK:</strong> A bad end to the week for the Scandi Crowns should not completely dethrone the Norwegian or Swedish Krona given bullish/positive impulses via relatively strong manufacturing output (vs forecast and elsewhere) and the Riksbank’s latest hawkish hold. To recap, the Swedish CB maintained guidance for a hike at the end of this year or early 2020 as its assessment is largely unchanged from the April meeting and inflation is still on track to hit target despite external risks that warrant a cautious approach to monetary policy adjustments/further normalisation. Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek currently around 9.6800 and 10.5875 respectively within 9.7020-6220 and 10.6070-4890 ranges.</p><p><strong>* EMFX:</strong> In similar vein to the significant post-US jobs data moves and change in direction noted above, regional currencies were prone to big swings on Friday that detracted from prior more encouraging developments and price developments. In fact, the Real, Rand, Lira etc were appreciably stronger vs the Buck when Brazilian Pension Reform bill prospects were on the up, fresh financial aid for SA’s Eskom was touted, Turkish inflation retreated further, US sanction threats receded post-G20 and investor demand for 5 year US-denominated bonds swamped the amount on offer. Usd/Brl, Usd/Zar and Usd/Try hit bases of around 3.7845, 13.9600 and 5.5845 before rebounding sharply towards 3.8400, 14.2000 and 5.6445, but still shy of 3.8800, 14.2740 and 5.7910 highs.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Back with a bang from Independence Day, as a bumper US payroll gain boosts the Dollar across the board and shifts market expectations for the end of month FOMC meeting markedly. In sum, after a string of mixed to weak data and survey releases the return to 200k+ jobs growth more than overshadowed softer than forecast average earnings and an unexpected uptick in the unemployment rate, as labour force participation also edged higher. The DXY cleared 97.000 and resistance just above in response before setting sights on the 50 DMA at 97.270 and beyond to expose 97.500 and 97.766 ahead of the Fed’s MPR and Chair Powell’s twin testimonies next week.</p><p><strong>NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Friday’s fall guy and a hefty loser over the week as RBNZ policy perceptions remain dovish amidst a further deterioration in NZ business sentiment and a call for two more OCR cuts this year. The Kiwi is over 100 pips off highs and looking precarious just above 0.6600, while the <strong>AUD</strong>/Nzd cross is eyeing 1.0550 as the Aussie continues to benefit to an extent from short covering in wake of the back-to-back RBA easing earlier this week. To recap, following a 2nd and widely anticipated 25bp reduction to a fresh all time low of 1%, the accompanying statement and subsequent comments from Governor signalled a shift in stance to wait-and-see mode given the ½ point loosening delivered and fiscal boost via the Government’s big tax cut package. Note, Aud/Usd has lost grip of the 0.7000 handle again, but is off worst levels after testing big barrier defences/offers at 0.7050 at one stage.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Also on course to end the week at worst levels or new lows vs the Greenback, as the Franc falls through 0.9900 vs circa 0.9764 at the other extreme and Yen trades at weakest levels for July so far near 108.60 compared to 107.54 at best. NFP aside, both safe-havens have been subject to swings in broad risk sentiment, at various times and not in unison, but also dovish SNB and BoJ vibes.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Somewhat mixed independent impulses for the single currency as Eurozone manufacturing PMIs revealed more pronounced weakness and/or contraction, while German data and industry outlooks continued to disappoint vs better news from the services sector overall and Italy managing to get off the EU’s EDP hook. However, Eur/Usd is down near 1.1200 vs circa 1.1375 at the high on the aforementioned Greenback revival and repricing of Fed rate expectations (-50 bp in July now assigned less than 10% probability vs 25%+ pre-NFP) and increasingly dovish ECB perceptions based on recent rhetoric and the nomination of IMF head Lagarde to take over from President Draghi. Meanwhile, ongoing political/Brexit uncertainty and the risk of no deal continued to undermine Sterling, but Cable’s steeper declines below 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp’s rebound towards 0.9000 and late June peaks came on the back of a dovish/downbeat twist from BoE Governor Carney plus a dismal trio of UK PMIs that prompted IHS/Markit to predict -0.1% Q2 GDP, ahead of next week’s monthly report for May from the ONS.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>A choppy week for the Loonie between 1.3145-3035 parameters, with Usd/Cad trading at lows after contrasting Canadian and US trade balances (former revealing a small, but surprise surplus vs latter showing a wider than consensus deficit) before the tables turned on jobs data even though Canada’s labour report was better than the headline figure suggested. Indeed, permanent placements rose and wages were strong heading into the BoC policy meeting, so the Bank could well play down the mildly negative net tally as a temporary blip.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A bad end to the week for the Scandi Crowns should not completely dethrone the Norwegian or Swedish Krona given bullish/positive impulses via relatively strong manufacturing output (vs forecast and elsewhere) and the Riksbank’s latest hawkish hold. To recap, the Swedish CB maintained guidance for a hike at the end of this year or early 2020 as its assessment is largely unchanged from the April meeting and inflation is still on track to hit target despite external risks that warrant a cautious approach to monetary policy adjustments/further normalisation. Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek currently around 9.6800 and 10.5875 respectively within 9.7020-6220 and 10.6070-4890 ranges.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In similar vein to the significant post-US jobs data moves and change in direction noted above, regional currencies were prone to big swings on Friday that detracted from prior more encouraging developments and price developments. In fact, the Real, Rand, Lira etc were appreciably stronger vs the Buck when Brazilian Pension Reform bill prospects were on the up, fresh financial aid for SA’s Eskom was touted, Turkish inflation retreated further, US sanction threats receded post-G20 and investor demand for 5 year US-denominated bonds swamped the amount on offer. Usd/Brl, Usd/Zar and Usd/Try hit bases of around 3.7845, 13.9600 and 5.5845 before rebounding sharply towards 3.8400, 14.2000 and 5.6445, but still shy of 3.8800, 14.2740 and 5.7910 highs.</p>",

Fed’s Powell suggested in his recent press conference that the central bank looks at the three-month trend, rather than a single print, and if the headline was realised, it would only be a touch above the three-month average rate at 155k. The pace of wage growth is seen accelerating vs May levels, while there will also be attention on the U6 underemployment rate, which fell to a cyclical low in May, amid a stable participation rate, which is seen as a positive. The data will be a key part of the FOMC’s case on whether it chooses to cut rates or stand pat on policy at the July policy meeting. The data will be released at 1330 BST/0830 EDT on 5 July 2019. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/22219/download\"><strong>here</strong></a></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

The DXY has inched back up towards 97.000 and into a marginally firmer range, but may be capped by resistance seen between the big figure and 97.010 awaiting the latest BLS report and return of US markets after yesterday’s market holiday.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD</strong></p><p>The major underperformers, though not by much, as the Franc and Kiwi hover around 0.9875 and 0.6670 respectively vs the Greenback and both still within recent trading parameters awaiting further direction from the aforementioned NFP metrics.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Yen has slipped back to around 108.00 from safe-haven highs circa 107.50 earlier this week, but may derive some support from decent option expiry interest at the 108.00 strike (1 bn), or heavy supply said to be stacked from 108.50 if the US labour data is strong. Meanwhile, the single currency is testing key downside technical levels in wake of yet more poor German data, like converged DMAs and a Fib in the 1.1259-62 region, but outpacing the Swedish Krona amidst a sharp slide in Hexagon shares (due to the IT firm flagging weakness in China). Indeed, Eur/Sek has rebounded firmly from sub-10.5000 levels towards 10.5500.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie is holding up better than its G10 peers and forming base above 0.7000/1.0500 vs the Usd and Nzd as post-RBA short covering continues, while the Loonie has lost some ground after a trade data-related boost as the focus switches to Canadian jobs data alongside NFP. However, Usd/Cad remains closer to weekly lows between 1.3045-70, and Cable is also nearer the bottom end of a 1.2550-87 range after this week’s bleak UK PMIs and further survey evidence of Brexit uncertainty weighing on the economy (BDO retail activity weak and IoD business morale worse).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mixed following the non-existent lead from Wall Street where markets were shut due to Independence Day and with the region tentative heading into the key US Non-Farm Payrolls data. ASX 200 (+0.6%) was positive with the index led higher by strength in financials and real estate after APRA effectively relaxed guidance on mortgage lending in which banks will be able to review and set their own minimum rate floor in assessing serviceability, although gains were capped for most the session by weakness in the commodity-related sectors. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was choppy as it failed to find inspiration from the highest growth in Household Spending since 2015, due to a humdrum tone in the currency and the KOSPI (+0.1%) traded cautious amid losses in index heavyweight Samsung Electronics which beat expectations in its preliminary earnings for Q2 but still showed oper. profit slipped by 56% Y/Y. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were subdued after further PBoC inaction resulted to a net weekly liquidity drain of CNY 340bln, while there were also recent mixed comments from China’s MOFCOM which confirmed US-China trade teams are in communication but also suggested that tariffs must be removed for a trade deal to occur. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher and briefly reclaimed the 154.00 level with mild support seen amid the lacklustre risk tone in Japan and BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 555bln of JGBs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed following the non-existent lead from Wall Street where markets were shut due to Independence Day and with the region tentative heading into the key US Non-Farm Payrolls data. ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with the index led higher by strength in financials and real estate after APRA effectively relaxed guidance on mortgage lending in which banks will be able to review and set their own minimum rate floor in assessing serviceability, although gains in the broader market are capped by weakness in the commodity-related sectors. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) failed to benefit from the highest growth in Household Spending since 2015, due to a humdrum tone in the currency and KOSPI (+0.1%) trades cautious amid losses in index heavyweight Samsung Electronics which beat expectations in its preliminary earnings for Q2 but still showed oper. profit slipped by 56% Y/Y. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are subdued after further PBoC inaction resulted to a net weekly liquidity drain of CNY 340bln, while there were also recent mixed comments from China’s MOFCOM which confirmed US-China trade teams are in communication but also suggested that tariffs must be removed for a trade deal to occur.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and has stuck to the prior day’s tight range due to the lack of US participants for the 4th July celebrations and with global investors awaiting the upcoming US jobs data for want of a better catalyst to spur prices. The greenback’s major counterparts are also uneventful with EUR/USD contained below the 1.1300 handle within proximity to its 5- and 100-DMA levels at 1.1283 and 1.1262 respectively, while GBP/USD remains near YTD lows beneath 1.2600 with a newswire poll suggesting the currency could drop to a 1.1700 bottom range during the month after a no-deal Brexit scenario. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses trade sideways amid the tentative risk tone and antipodeans are also uneventful with the only glimmer of excitement coming from mild upside in AUD/NZD as it attempts to make headway above 1.0500.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher to reclaim the 154.00 level with mild support seen amid the lacklustre risk tone in Japan and BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 555bln of JGBs.</p>",
