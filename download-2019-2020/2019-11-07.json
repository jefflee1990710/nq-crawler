However, although an impressive 30-year auction, it did little to change the dial on the sell-off in the debt complex.

However, the risk appetite was evident, with higher oil prices boosting the energy sector, higher Treasury yields boosting the financials, and cyclical sectors, such as tech and telecoms, leading the pact too; defensives (health care and utilities) were predictably subdued. Havens in general took hits, with XAU shedding over 20 bucks, with an ounce of bullion now closer to 1,450 than it is 1,500, and UsdJpy drifting further above its 200dma at 109.02, which has served as resistance in recent sessions. The US sold USD 19bln of 30-year bonds in what was an impressive auction, but still, the risk-on sentiment very much overpowered any meaningful turn around in the debt complex’s sell-off. The higher yields were dollar supportive, but so too was the BoE meeting, which caught cable longs offside after the decision to hold was diluted by two dovish dissenters, opening up the potential for easing from the bank as global growth concerns and Brexit uncertainty linger into UK monpol.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>A further bout of optimistic US/China headlines hit the market this morning, where both sides agreed to cancel existing tariffs in different phases, noting the magnitude of cancellations can be negotiated and will depend on the phase one content. However, optimism was faded somewhat on sources reports from Reuters that there was “fierce” opposition within the White House on the plans to roll back the tariffs, with no decision yet been made, with a separate WSJ piece citing a US source as saying there had been no plans to roll back tariffs; this caution does align with some previous reports, such as the FT which suggested it was unclear whether Trump would agree, and previous hawkish sentiment from White House Trade Advisor Navarro, who said a few weeks ago he would be opposed to tariff roll backs until progress on IP theft had been made. However, close to the US cash equity close NEC Director Kudlow said there would be tariff concessions if there was a Phase One deal (he didn’t clarify whether or not if concessions will be removed on the actual signing of the deal, nor how much of the tariffs would be rolled back to). FBN’s Lawrence reported China trade sources saying that China wants all tariffs rolled back as phases of the trade deal are completed, and that the US offered to roll back some tariffs but wants to keep majority in place until the Chinese reach certain milestones after the full trade deal is completed. Additionally, the Chinese have recently been very vocal in questioning whether a phase one deal could be signed, unless the US issued a complete removal of tariffs, which had been a key sticking point in talks. Earlier on, China Global times Editor noted the attitude of the Chinese side is clear that both sides must simultaneously and proportionally remove existing additional tariffs in order to reach a phase one deal, seeming more in line with China’s recent requests. China’s MOFCOM stated<strong> if</strong> a phase one deal is reached, both sides must cancel the agreed scale of tariffs simultaneously. The “if” used in the language suggest a deal is not certain, but nonetheless, progress is clearly still being made. At midday, the US announced that the first trade deal with China would include a rollback of tariffs, further adding to the risk on sentiment. All-in-all, none of the back-and-forth headlines and sources reports seem to contain details that cover timing, implementation and precise timing of tariff roll backs, details which will surely become clearer as the sides move closer to an agreement, or not. Separately, on fentanyl imports, the Chinese Narcotic Commission sentenced nine people for smuggling fentanyl into the US, in accordance with a consensus reached by US President Trump and Chinese President Xi. Trump has constantly advocated for the Chinese to help more with the fentanyl shipments with the US, therefore this move will likely be praised by the President.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>Policymakers at the MPC once again opted to stand pat on rates at 0.75%, however, this time around the decision was subject to dissent from Haskel and Saunders who, instead favoured a 25bps rate reduction (consensus looked for a unanimous decision). Haskel and Saunders opted to dissent on the basis that downside risks to the Bank’s projections have emanated from a softer global outlook and more persistent Brexit uncertainties affecting corporate and household spending. However, this stance was out-voted by the broader view that there is currently not enough data points available to assess the impact of the aforementioned concerns held by those wishing for a rate reduction. Elsewhere, one key aspect of the minutes release was the Bank’s updated view on Brexit which underpinned the accompanying projections in the MPR. Policymakers noted that as a result of the UK and EU striking a deal on the WA, Political declaration and extension to A50, the perceived likelihood of a no deal Brexit has fallen markedly. As such, the MPC now assume an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. With this in mind, the MPC opted to remove guidance on what action would be taken in the event of a no deal Brexit, whilst reiterating their mantra to respond in either direction to ensure “a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target”. Furthermore, the Bank reassured markets once again that a period of “entrenched uncertainty” could be a cause to act, however, if these risks do not materialise and the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPC’s projections, “monetary policy could be tightened at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”. Overall, the latest communication from the Bank suggests less concern over the possibility of a no deal Brexit, however, a further prolongation of the Brexit process could see the BoE provide the UK economy with further monetary loosening. Piecing it all together, the dissent to the decision suggests that the MPC has moved further away from its previous bias of gradual and limited rate rises, however, the Bank feels confident in using PM Johnson’s deal as a basis for their forward-looking assumptions and therefore appear to have greater conviction in their outlook than in previous reports. That said, given the upcoming general election, whether or not this deal will materialise is yet to be seen and therefore by the time of the next MPR in January (on day before the current A50 extension deadline), it is plausible another Brexit outcome could have to be factored in. Overall, ING suggest “while we expect 2020 to be another uncertain year for the UK economy, we still think it is probably still a little too early to be pencilling in rate cuts”.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Iran continues to scale back its commitments to the 2015 nuclear accord, where Arab News reported this morning the uranium enrichment level at the Fordow plant is almost at pre-nuclear levels, also of note, a UN nuclear inspector has had her accreditation removed by Iran, reported AFP.

Meanwhile, Brent Jan’ 20 futures, although making solid gains, failed to break back above the USD 63.00/bbl mark and threaten yesterday’s USD 63.30/bbl high. Crude specific newsflow on the day has been very light; Motiva Port Arthur Texas Refinery (636k BPD) has reportedly shut its reformer and hydrotreaters, sources stated.

The US sold 19bln in 30-year bonds tailing the 2.424% WI by 0.6bps, whilst being covered by 2.23x, in line with the six-auction average; the takedown was impressive, however, with dealers taking a record low share of 20.7%, directs took an impressive 20.5%, whilst indirects took 58.8%, in line with their average. However, although an impressive 30-year auction, it did little to change the dial on the sell-off in the debt complex. By settlement the US Treasury curve had re-steepened from Wednesday, with the 2s/10s just over 3bps wider, with the 2-year yield just over 7bps higher itself.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3085, NASDAQ-100 0.3% at 8220, Dow Jones 0.7% at 27675.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.6%, Consumer Staples -0.4%, Energy 1.6%, Financials 0.7%, Health Care 0.1%, Industrials 0.2%, Information Technology 0.7%, Materials 0.7%, Telecommunication Services 0.7%, Utilities -1.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> HP Inc.

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Spanish elections forecast to fail in breaking political deadlock",
        "content": "<p><strong>* POLLS: </strong>On Sunday November 10th, Spaniards will return to the polls for the second time this year, after acting PM Sanchez (Leader of Spanish Socialist Workers Party, PSOE) failed to form a coalition government following April’s inconclusive elections. Yet polling in the run up to next election points towards the outcome being even less conclusive than the last; El Pais polling (October 23rd-29th) sees PSOE maintain its status as the country’s largest party, taking a 27.3% share of the vote, which would see the party gain 121 seats, two less than the 123 seats it currently holds; and significantly below the 176 required for an absolute majority. Meanwhile, the left-wing Unidas Podemos Party, who failed to form a coalition government with PSOE despite extensive negotiations, look set to lose roughly 2% of the popular vote which would see the Party’s number of seats fall to 31 from 42. Some of the votes lost by these two parties looks set to go to the newly formed centre left party Mas Pais, who formed out of protest against PSOE and Unidas Podemos’ failure to form a coalition government. The left-wing also appear to have relinquished some support to the right-wing People’s Party and Vox, who have seen their popularity rise amid unrest in Catalunya due to their tough stance against Catalan independence. They look set to gain 4.5% and 3.5% of the vote respectively, translating into a 25-seat gain for People’s Party and a 22-seat gain for Vox. However, much of this gain does come as a result a substantial fall in support for centre right party Ciudadanos (Citizens), who are slated to lose 43 seats. Other recent polls point to a similar result in terms of no party achieving a majority.</p><p><strong>* DEADLOCK TO CONTINUE: </strong>Despite some shuffling of seats, the underlying picture looks set to be little changed, as in, neither the left-wing parties or the right parties look likely to gain enough support to form a coalition with a convincing majority. In that regard, political uncertainty looks set to continue, as parties’ manoeuvre to form a functional coalition.</p><p><strong>* EFFECT ON SPAIN’S ECONOMY: </strong>“The economic impact of further political stalemate is likely to be negligible” argues CapEco, citing the fact that recent previous elections and the Catalonia independence referendum in 2017 did little to dent activity or confidence in Spain. Which would imply that, as long as things go as expected (i.e. deadlock continues), Spain's election is likely to be a market non-event. However, the consultancy argues that Spain’s economy, which has outperformed the Eurozone in recent years, is likely to slow down over the next year or so for non-political reasons; firstly, consumer spending growth is set to slow down now that the countries period of rapid employment growth appears to have ended. Secondly, investment is likely to grow at a slower pace than in the past couple of years due to recent declines in business confidence, recent drops in the country’s Manufacturing PMI data and a drop in Spanish firms’ demand for credit to fund fixed investment, which fell sharply in Q3. Finally, with government debt levels near 100% of GDP and a structural budget deficit of 2.6%, hopes of a big fiscal stimulus are likely to be dashed. “We expect GDP growth to slow from 2.0% this year to 1.2% in 2020”, concludes CapEco.&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: not so super Thursday for Sterling, but fab for Norwegian Crown and Yuan",
        "content": "<p><strong>NOK/GBP</strong></p><p>Flanking the G10 ranks amidst a broad recovery in risk sentiment sparked by China’s Commerce Ministry claiming that the US has agreed to a phased and concurrent removal of like-for-like tariffs based on content and contingent on finalising trade deal Phase 1. Norway’s Krona is flying with extra impetus from manufacturing production rising twice as much as expected and a firm rebound in crude prices, plus increasingly bullish technical impulses. Indeed, Eur/Nok breached Fib support at 10.0610 after clearing the 1.1300-1.12500 area that held earlier in the week to expose a deeper downside chart target at 10.0350 (50 DMA) and 10.0000 vs a 10.3100+ record high set on October 29. Conversely, the Pound has been undermined by 2 dovish dissenters at the BoE’s MPC, including erstwhile hawk Saunders who teamed up with Haskel in favour of a pre-emptive 25 bp rate cut. Cable had already slipped below the 10 DMA (1.2881) and tested the 21 DMA (1.2839), but then ducked under 1.2800 and stopped just short of a recent trough (1.2789 from late last month) before paring some lost ground. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp bounced from near 0.8600 lows through the 21 DMA (0.8646) and 0.8650 before the cross topped out. Back to the BoE, MPR and latest minutes, the dissent to the decision suggests that the MPC has moved further away from its previous bias of gradual and limited rate rises, but the Bank feels confident using PM Johnson’s Brexit deal as a basis for its forward-looking assumptions and therefore appears to have greater conviction in the outlook than in previous reports. That said, given the upcoming general election, whether or not this deal will materialise is yet to be seen and therefore by the time of the next MPR in January (one day before the current A50 extension deadline), it is plausible that another Brexit outcome could have to be factored in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CNH/AUD</strong></p><p>Although the Greenback gradually derived momentum from a sharp rebound in US Treasury yields and reversion to marked curve steepening, with the <strong>DXY</strong> finally eclipsing Fib resistance at 98.085, the offshore Yuan maintained gains and got close to 6.9625 multi-month highs. To recap, Usd/Cnh (and Usd/Cny) retreated below 7.0000 on the aforementioned positive US-China trade reports that were subsequently embellished by media talk suggesting that Washington is still eyeing next week for Trump and X1 to seal Phase 1, contrary to speculation on Wednesday that the ceremonious signing between the 2 Presidents may be delayed until next month. Elsewhere, the Aussie also benefited from the encouraging trade news and a bulging trade surplus, but could not quite keep hold of the 0.6900 handle as its US counterpart built up a head of steam.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>All overwhelmed by the Buck’s extended advances (index up over 98.200 at best), with single currency still heavy on approaches to 1.1100 and threatening to close below Fib support, while the Franc has slipped through 0.9950, Kiwi under 0.6350 and Yen below recent lows to test a Fib level protecting 109.50.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In similar vein to yesterday, the Real is emerging as the regional underperformer, partly on the general and growing Dollar noted above, but also due to more Brazilian oil field auction angst as the 2nd batch of smaller sites failed to rouse any more interest, or arguably even less than the 4 that went under the hammer on Wednesday. Usd/Brl has been over 4.1000, but drifting back from peaks presently.</p>",

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p>Policymakers at the MPC once again opted to stand pat on rates at 0.75%, however, this time around the decision was subject to dissent from Haskel and Saunders who, instead favoured a 25bps rate reduction (consensus looked for a unanimous decision). Haskel and Saunders opted to dissent on the basis that downside risks to the Bank’s projections have emanated from a softer global outlook and more persistent Brexit uncertainties affecting corporate and household spending. However, this stance was out-voted by the broader view that there is currently not enough data points available to assess the impact of the aforementioned concerns held by those wishing for a rate reduction. Elsewhere, one key aspect of the minutes release was the Bank’s updated view on Brexit which underpinned the accompanying projections in the MPR. Policymakers noted that as a result of the UK and EU striking a deal on the WA, Political declaration and extension to A50, the perceived likelihood of a no deal Brexit has fallen markedly. As such, the MPC now assume an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. With this in mind, the MPC opted to remove guidance on what action would be taken in the event of a no deal Brexit, whilst reiterating their mantra to respond in either direction to ensure “a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target”. Furthermore, the Bank reassured markets once again that a period of “entrenched uncertainty” could be a cause to act, however, if these risks do not materialise and the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPC’s projections, “monetary policy could be tightened at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”. Overall, the latest communication from the Bank suggests less concern over the possibility of a no deal Brexit, given the increased clarity on the potential path for the UK and EU’s future trading relationship, however, a further prolongation of the Brexit process could see the BoE provide the UK economy with further monetary loosening. In terms of the MPC’s assessment of the UK economy as detailed in the accompanying Monetary Policy Report, the Banks messaging was somewhat muddled after opting to abandon direct comparisons for their quarterly projections with the August report given the dichotomy between market pricing and their assessment of the economy (market placed a lot more focus on the prospect of a no deal, whereas the Bank now does not envisage this). The Bank provided adjusted previous’ for quarterly projections, however, opted to not included any adjusted previous’ for the annual figures (to the bemusement of the journalists at the press conferences). As such, any comparison between the Banks view in November and August is difficult with the MPC trying to guide market expectations more towards the overall contents of the latest MPR rather than a contrast to the August QIR. In terms of what the November MPR tells us, the MPC expected UK GDP to pick up from 1.0% this year to 1.6% by the end of 2020, 1.8% in Q4 2021 and hit 2.1% by the end of the forecast period. The perceived trend of growth is predicated on the assumption of a reduction in uncertainty, albeit investment spending is held back by slower global growth. From an inflation perspective, inflation is seen as slipping to 1.4% by the end of the year and only modestly rising to 1.5% by the end of 2020 as a result of lower regulated energy and utility prices before picking up thereafter to target by the end of 2021 and 2.2% by the end of the forecast horizon. Piecing it all together, the dissent to the decision suggests that the MPC has moved further away from its previous bias of gradual and limited rate rises, however, the Bank feels confident in using PM Johnson’s deal as a basis for their forward-looking assumptions and therefore appear to have greater conviction in their outlook than in previous reports. That said, given the upcoming general election, whether or not this deal will materialise is yet to be seen and therefore by the time of the next MPR in January (on day before the current A50 extension deadline), it is plausible another Brexit outcome could have to be factored in. Overall, ING suggest “while we expect 2020 to be another uncertain year for the UK economy, we still think it is probably still a little too early to be pencilling in rate cuts”.</p>",

If global growth fails to stabilise or Brexit uncertainties remain entrenched, monetary policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation. If these risks do not materialise and the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPC’s projections, monetary policy could be tightened at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Note, the MPC have removed guidance on the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>Brexit: As a result of the UK and EU striking a deal on the WA and Political declaration and extension to A50, the perceived likelihood of a no deal Brexit has fallen markedly.</p><p>Underlying assumptions of projections: Projections are based on the assumption of an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. The assumptions conclude no tariffs on UK-EU trade, whilst customs checks on UK-EU trade are introduced, some services trade would be subject to greater barriers, regulatory barriers with the EU are likely to gradually increase, the UK replicates a substantial proportion of EU trade agreements with non-EU countries. <i>Full details can be found on Table 1, page 12 of the MPR.</i></p><p>Domestic growth: UK GDP has slowed materially this year and reflects weaker global growth, driven by trade protectionism and Brexit-related uncertainties. The agreements struck between the UK and EU are expected to remove some of the uncertainty facing businesses and households and as such, the MPC expects growth to pick up in 2020.</p><p>Inflation: Inflationary pressures are expected to lessen in the near term. Inflation is expected to fall to around 1.25% by the spring, owing to the temporary effect of falls in regulated energy and water prices. In the second half of the MPC’s forecast period, however, domestic inflationary pressures are expected to build before rising to slightly above 2% at the end of the forecast period.</p>",

Looking at indices, Germany’s DAX moved as high as 13290, its best levels since early February 2018, while Euro Stoxx 50 came within a whisker of its 2017 high at 3710. Sectors performance is reflective of the markets risk-on feel; defensives lag (Utilities -0.5%, Health Care unch., Staples -0.3%) while the more risk sensitive Tech (+0.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+1.0%), Industrials and Materials (+0.6%) lead the pack. Meanwhile, the Energy (-0.4%) sector has struggled to take advantage of the market rally, weighed on by crude prices which fell substantially yesterday, albeit the sector and energy complex have recoiled off lows amid the aforementioned trade headlines. In terms of individual movers, things are still very much dominated by earnings: Vestas Wind systems (+11.6%) post-earnings and in light of the announcement of a EUR 200mln buyback programme. Lufthansa (+8.1%) rose to the top of its index despite strike threats after earnings topped analyst forecasts with heavy-weight Siemens (+4.6%) a close second following encouraging earnings coupled with a EUR 0.10/shr dividend raise. Other post-earning movers include: UniCredit (+5.9%), ProsiebentSat1 (-5.0%), Scout24 (-4.3%), Commerzbank (+0.3%) and Deutsche Telekom (-2.9%)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>YUAN - The Cnh and Cny have both been boosted by latest comments from China’s MOFCOM claiming that Beijing and Washington have now agreed to lift tit-for-tat import levies in tandem and step-by-step once Phase 1 of the overall deal is agreed. The offshore and onshore Yuan are back above the psychological 7.0000 mark and extending gains towards key technical resistance around 6.9625 for the former vs the Usd after retreating on Wednesday and pulling back further when reports about a delay to December from this month for the Trump-Xi meeting to sign part one of the pact broke.</p><p>AUD/NZD - The main beneficiaries of the more positive China-US trade talk, with the Aussie back on the 0.6900 handle and Aud/Usd also boosted by much wider Australian trade surplus, while the Kiwi has bounced firmly from circa 0.6350 towards 0.6400 vs the Greenback, but lagging its Antipodean peer as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds from around 1.0800 to 1.0825+.</p><p>EUR/CAD/GBP - Also firmer against the Buck, as the DXY dips a bit further from another 98.000+ venture that topped out just short of Fib resistance again, with the single currency also spurred on by hawkish ECB rhetoric via Holzmann and back above a key chart support level within a 1.1055-92 range. The Loonie has pared post-Canadian Ivey PMI declines from almost 1.3200 to probe bids/support ahead of 1.3150 and Cable has bounced off the 21 DMA (1.2839) through 1.2850 and not far from the 10 DMA (1.2881) in the run up to the BoE from high noon.</p><p>CHF/JPY - Narrowly mixed and hampered by another reversal in sentiment/positioning in favour riskier currencies and assets, as the Franc retreats below 0.9900 vs the Dollar and Yen reverses from 108.66 to 109.19.</p><p>SEK/NOK/EM - In stark contrast to the above, renewed risk appetite has propelled the Scandi Crowns to revisit recent and/or register fresh peaks, with Eur/Sek having another look under 10.6500 and Eur/Nok breaching 10.1000 to expose the next major downside chart level at 10.0610 following stronger than forecast Norwegian manufacturing output. Elsewhere, most Emerging Market currencies are getting carried by the revived US-China trade narrative, but the Lira is lagging on deteriorating US-Turkish relations and increasingly dovish CBRT expectations.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Although Chinese contentions appearing to confirm conditional agreement on the removal of tariffs have not been corroborated by the US, debt markets seem to be taking silence or the lack of any denial as validation on the basis that no news may well be good. Indeed, Bunds have now taken out Wednesday’s Eurex low, 170.00 and support just below the bog figure on the way down to 169.83, while Gilts have nudged nearer to 131.00 at 131.15 and the 10 year T-note hit 128-22+, with the yield up through recent peaks and well over yesterday’s auction level. Ahead, jobless claims and the long bond sale that comes with an even bigger concession.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude markets are staging a recovery, with positive developments on the US/China trade front (US &amp; China agreeing to roll back existing tariffs) acting as a tailwind. However, <strong>WTI</strong> Dec’ 19 and <strong>Brent</strong> Jan’ 2020 futures are still well off of yesterday’s USD 57.83/bbl and USD 63.30/bbl highs, after the complex was hit by a bearish EIA crude inventory report and concerns about a delay to the signing of the US/China Phase 1 trade deal - WTI is now consolidating just shy of the USD 57.00/bbl handle, Brent just beneath yesterday’s pre-EIA Inventory data lows at USD 62.39/bbl, which is acting as resistance. In terms of the metals; <strong>Gold</strong> price were hit by haven outflows on the back of positive trade related developments, falling to lows of USD 1486/oz from above USD 1490/oz. <strong>Copper</strong>, meanwhile, was buoyed and managed to reclaim the USD 2.700/lbs level.</p>",

The 10 year debt future has regained composure within a 131.69-52 range vs yesterday’s 131.62 close and is holding up better than Bunds and US Treasuries (former still sub-parity, albeit only 5 ticks adrift compared to -29 ticks at one stage), as attention shifts to the MPC policy decisions, minutes and November MPR, all at midday, then BoE Governor Carney’s press conference 30 minutes later – see the Ransquawk Research Suite for a full ‘super Thursday’ preview. Back to Liffe, the 3 month strip is flat to 1 tick down on the day vs -0.5 to -2 ticks at worst.</p>",

ASX 200 (+1.0%) was underpinned by outperformance in tech and the top-weighted financials sector with shares in NAB lifted despite a decline in full year profits, as the big 4 bank maintained its dividend unchanged from the interim and also announced top level executives will not receive short-term bonuses this year. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was pressured by a firmer currency and amid a slew of earnings including SoftBank which posted its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years due to the WeWork fiasco, while Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were choppy amid a lack of clarity on the timing and location for the signing of the US-China phase 1 trade deal and after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again, with gaming stocks also pressured after Galaxy Entertainment and Wynn Macau posted softer revenue figures. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly subdued following the recent downturn in prices and amid the lack of BoJ buying today, but with downside stemmed by the inconclusive risk tone and support ahead of the 153.00 level.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade indecisive as they take their cue from the similar performance of their US peers and with sentiment clouded by trade uncertainty after reports suggested the signing of the US-China phase 1 deal could be pushed back to December. ASX 200 (+0.7%) is underpinned by outperformance in tech and the top-weighted financials sector as shares in NAB gain despite reporting a decline in profits, as the big 4 bank maintained its dividend unchanged from the interim and also announced top level executives will not receive short-term bonuses this year. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) is pressured by a firmer currency and amid a slew of earnings including SoftBank which posted its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years due to the WeWork fiasco, while Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are choppy amid a lack of clarity on the timing and location for the signing of the US-China phase 1 trade deal and after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again, with gaming stocks also pressured after Galaxy Entertainment and Wynn Macau posted softer revenue figures.</p><p>In FX markets, a steadfast greenback remains the state of play with the DXY consolidating just slightly off the 98.00 level as its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD retest this week’s lows around the mid-1.1000 and 1.2800 handles respectively. Nonetheless, overnight price action, as well as pertinent news flow has been light for the greenback and its transatlantic peers although a major newswire poll recently showed around two-thirds of analysts anticipate the USD-rally to continue for another 6-months, while the same poll also predicts EUR/USD to reclaim 1.1400 in a year. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is subdued by the vague risk tone and with the flows into Japanese currency facilitated by rising JGB yields, while antipodeans have ceded further ground against USD which coincides with a weaker CNY as the trade uncertainty overshadows a firmer reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly lower in a continuation in the recent downturn in prices and amid the lack of BoJ buying today, but with downside stemmed by the inconclusive risk tone and by support ahead of the 153.00 level.</p>",
