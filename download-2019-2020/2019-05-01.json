(Newswires)</p><p>Fed stated that overall and core inflation have declined on a 12-month basis but added that inflation received since March indicates economic activity has risen at a solid pace and it removed its reference to low inflation being due to energy prices. Fed added job gains have been solid although growth of household spending as well as business and fixed investment have slowed, while it reiterated patience as it determines what future adjustments to rate might be appropriate and are to roll over principal payments from its holding of treasury securities that exceed USD 15bln as previously announced.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell commented during the press conference that the change in IOER was technical and not a shift in Fed policy, while he added that a small deviation outside of Fed funds target range would not be important and suggested they could look at the idea of a Repo facility at an upcoming meeting. Furthermore, Powell commented that the inflation drop in early 2019 was unexpected and there might be transitory factors at work, while he does not see case for moving policy in either direction and that the data is not pushing Fed in either direction.</p><p>The press conference was viewed as less dovish than some had hoped for as Powell attempted to navigate a neutral line and suggested the IOER was a technical adjustment that does not represent any shift in the Fed's policy stance, while markets also focused on the view that the unexpected decline in core inflation is likely to be transitory. In addition, Powell was pressed on conditions that the Fed would need to see before considering cutting rates but seemed to be reticent to be drawn into the question and instead reiterated the Fed's policy targets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer have concluded their 'productive' meetings with China's Vice Premier Liu He, talks are to continue in Washington next week. (Newswires)</p><p>A trade deal between US and China is said to be possible by the end of next week, according to sources. Reports noted US and China are said to have neared a deal to roll-back some tariffs which could be announced by the end of next week, while both sides have reached an understanding on how to enforce the agreement although the sources cautioned that details still need to be worked out when a Chinese delegation arrives in Washington on 8 May. Furthermore, reports added there is a general agreement on a plan for the US to immediately remove a 10% tariff on a portion of the USD 200bln worth of Chinese imports affected by the penalty but the USD 50bln tranche of 25% tariffs may remain potentially to after 2020. (Newswires/WSJ/Politico)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p>UK PM May believes it is possible to achieve a deal with the EU in the second phase of the negotiations before 2020 and that they have shown willingness to compromise on areas of the Withdrawal Agreement. Furthermore, PM May commented there are different ways to approach a future customs union with the EU and suggested what they are trying to achieve for the customs union is similar to Labour’s aims. (Newswires)</p><p>UK Labour opposition spokesman stated that we have seen clear evidence that the government are prepared to explore changes in their position on Brexit, while the spokesman added that there will be a full plenary session of cross-party Brexit discussion next week.

(Newswires)</p><p>Iranian officials agree that its oil sales could fall to 300-400k BPD this Summer (vs. 2.5mln BPD in May 2018), while there were separate reports that officials are said to be discussing potential Iranian scenarios in OPEC including Iran suspending its membership in OPEC until sanctions are removed or even departing from OPEC.

L3 Technologies (LLL) rose on strong earnings, the defence technology co. beating analyst expectations for both revenue and profits. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) opened lower after earnings missed on the top and bottom-line expectations. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) opened higher after the chipmaker also beat analyst expectations on both top and bottom lines. Tesla (TSLA) fell throughout the session, weighed down by the news that the electric automaker would be sued by the family of a driver who had been killed in a Tesla Model X autopilot crash. CVS Health (CVS) shares jumped higher pre-market after the health care services co. reported earnings on both top and bottom lines. Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) reported strong earnings, beating revenue expectations, but gave away pre-market gains. Humana (HUM) fell after the health insurer announced that it expects earnings to come in below the long-term EPS target of 11-15% in 2020, despite reporting a beat on both top and bottom-line expectations for Q1 19. Home Depot (HD) fell after the company’s CFO of 18 years, Carol Tome, announced her retirement. SPX -0.8% at 2923, NDX -0.4% at 7,752, DJI -0.6% at 26,429.</p><p>USTs floundered at the start of the day on thin volumes ahead of the Fed, with modest starting gains surrendered following a better than expected ADP report, with some traders noting a large block flattener of over 13k FVM9s vs over 2K ultra longs. Thereafter, however, ISM manufacturing missed at 52.8 vs. exp. 55 which added upside to the complex, with a large block buyer of 8k USM9 calls noted. The meat of the day, however, was then the Fed’s decision, which saw the curve steepening and treasuries pushing higher, with increased volumes on the front end post the unchanged rate and IOER 5bps cut to 2.35%.&nbsp; Yields broke the 10th April 2.461% low, but the move was faded after Powell stated the “surprising” inflation prints could be transitory, and the IOER cut was purely “technical”. Thereafter the curve flattened and treasuries slipped to session lows heading into the close. US T-note futures (M9) settled 3 ticks lower at 123-18+.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities down, dollar up, Treasuries mixed, crude mixed.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>FOMC on hold, cuts IOER, ISM Miss, ADP beat, US/China Trade deal could be announced next week</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>US jobless claims, GER retail sales (Mar), Mfg PMI (Apr/F), UK BOE/Carney, SWE Mfg PMI (Apr), AU serv/comp PMI (Apr/F), HU trade balance (Feb/F), CH Caixin Mfg PMI (Apr), India Mfg PMI (Apr), SK Mfg PMI (Apr), MEX Markit Mfg PMI (Apr), BRL Mfg PMI (Apr), Trade balance (Apr).</p><p><strong>* WEDNESDAY’S EARNINGS: </strong>DWDP, DOW; GILD; CI</p><p><strong>* FOMC RATE DECISION: </strong>As expected, the FOMC held the FFR at between 2.25-2.50%, though cut the IOER rate by 5bps to 2.35%. As the market was expecting, the Fed acknowledged the \"solid\" rate of growth (upgrading its view), while pointing out that inflation (both overall and core) has eased on a 12-month basis (now categorises it as 'below 2%'), and the central bank dropped its reference to low rates being a function of low energy prices. On the labour market, the Fed noted that job gains have been solid, though growth of household spending and business fixed investment has slowed. The decision was unanimous, and the Fed also reiterated its message of patience. On aggregate, there was not anything here that will have shocked the market.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>Fed Chair Powell attempted to navigate a neutral line in his press conference, reiterating the messages of the statement, while emphasising the appropriateness of the policy stance, and the familiar message of neutral. He added that while business fixed investment and household spending had slowed, he sees it rebounding in the months ahead. Risks have moderated since the beginning of Q1, and he noted data from China and Europe, and a disorderly Brexit has been pushed back; he also alluded to progress on trade talks with China, where the gains would be seen over time. On inflation he said the Fed strongly committed to symmetric inflation target; core inflation fall was unexpected, but likely transitory (this statement resulted in yields bounding back). Powell says the policy stance is currently appropriate and does not see the case to shift rates in either directions (the Fed chair on a few occasions reiterated that the current policy stance was appropriate); the IOER was a technical adjustment that does not represent any shift in the Fed's policy stance, and the FFR remains the central bank's main policy tool; he also said that the Fed could look at the possibility of a repo facility at upcoming meetings. Fed Chair Powell was pressed on conditions that the Fed would need to see before considering cutting rates, though he seemed reticent to be drawn into the question, and instead reiterated the Fed's policy targets. Asset prices were elevated, but not extremely so, though has some concern about corporate leverage; overall though, he does not see evidence of overheating. On the balance sheet, the FOMC had a discussion on the composition at this meeting; composition decision will need to be taken at future meetings, and any changes will be telegraphed well in advance.</p><p><strong>* ISM MANUFACTURING PMI DATA:</strong> The index fell to a two-and-a-half year low in April, coming in at 52.8 (against an expected 55.0, from a prior 55.3). Capital Economics said that the data illustrates that, after the contraction in manufacturing output in the first quarter, US factory conditions have deteriorated further,\" but adds that given the recent improvement in some of the key global manufacturing data (China PMIs, Korean exports, etc.) it expects to see activity in the US manufacturing sector stabilise soon. The breakdown offered little encouragement, too. New orders fell to 51.7 from 57.4, production and employment also both sharply dropped. Inventories rose to 52.9 from 51.8, and supplier delivery times ticked slightly higher to 54.6 from 54.2, \"but that was largely because demand is deteriorating even faster than production, which is hardly grounds for optimism,\" Capital Economics said. The consultancy notes that the alternative Markit manufacturing PMI (latest version also released today) also hit a near two-year low last month, and CapEco says that this underlines how the factory sector is struggling against a backdrop of subdued global growth, adding that \"the US manufacturing data have tended to lag China's PMIs by a few months or so, with the improvement in the latter over recent months suggesting that US factory conditions should begin to stabilise soon.\"</p><p><strong>* ADP EMPLOYMENT DATA:</strong> The US economy added 275k nonfarm payroll jobs in April, according to ADP, which was significantly above the 180k consensus. The prior was revised up 22k to 151k. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that this data release is at odds with recent survey evidence which suggests current labour demand running at between 175k-200k per month. However, it says that this month's report seems to be free of obvious distortions and, as such, cannot be ignored. \"The survey is not a reliable indicator of the official payroll numbers every month but the error against our ADP forecast is big enough to move the needle on our estimate for Friday's official report,\" the consultancy writes, \"we now expect the BLS to report a 240K increase in April payrolls.\"</p><p><strong>* US CONSTRUCTION SPENDING:</strong> Fell -0.9% M/M (expectations saw a flat reading). \"Growth in the previous two months was revised down significantly, with spending growth in February (-0.3pp to +0.7%) and January (-1.8pp to +0.7%) now appearing much more moderate than previously reported,\" Goldman Sachs said, \"March saw a decline in private construction spending, as residential construction (-1.8%) declined but non-residential construction increased (+0.5%). Public residential construction edged up (+0.1%) but public non-residential construction declined (-1.3%).\" After the data today, Goldman Sachs' Q2 GDP tracking estimate was lowered by 0.2ppts to 1.7%</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>US and China have neared deal to roll-back some tariffs, Politico reports, and a deal could be announced by the end of next week. The deal reportedly includes a broad agreement on how the Trump administration will roll-back a portion of the tariffs it has imposed on more than USD 250bln-worth of Chinese goods, according sources. The two sides have also reached an understanding on how to enforce the agreement, although sources cautioned that details still need to be worked out when a Chinese delegation arrives in Washington on 8 May, Politico said. The newspaper also said that the two sides have reached general agreement on a plan for the US to immediately remove a 10% tariff on a portion of the USD 200bln worth of Chinese imports affected by the penalty, and then phase in lifting the duties on the rest of the items 'quickly,' said one of the people familiar with the discussions.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 0.31 LOWER AT USD 63.60/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD 0.17 HIGHER AT USD 72.18/BBL</strong>. Crude fell on Wednesday after DOE data echoed what was seen in the API data on Tuesday: Crude Stocks +9.934mln (Exp. 1.485mln), Cushing +0.265mln (Exp. +0.2mln), Gasoline +0.917mln (Exp. -1.005mln), Distillates-1.307mln (Exp. -0.193mln); US crude production, meanwhile, rose to a fresh record high at 12.3mln BPD. The losses seen snapped back the gains earlier in the session, amid the ongoing concerns that protests in Venezuela to pressure President Maduro to step down may put around 800k bpd of crude oil production at risk; and this explains why Brent is performing slightly better than its WTI counterpart (both are negative, though). In other news, Iranian officials agreed that its oil sales could fall to between 300-400k BPD this Summer (vs. 2.5mln BPD in May 2018), according to WSJ, which also lent some positive ticks to Brent, ahead of the weekly US inventory data. However, Iraq is reportedly planning to boost crude oil exports from its Southern port to 3.45mln BPD, newswires said. Finally, Bloomberg's OPEC survey was released on Wednesday, and analysts see OPEC crude output rising +25K BPD to 30.3mln BPD in April, as Libya's gains offset losses from sanctions against Iran; on Tuesday, the comparable Reuters survey showed analysts expected OPEC oil output to fall by 90k BPD from March to 30.23mln BPD, which would be the lowest level since 2015.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.8% at 2923, NDX -0.4% at 7,752, DJI -0.6% at 26,429. SECTORS: Communications -0.8%, Cons Discretionary -1.1%, Cons Staples -1.2%, Energy -2.2%, Financials -0.9%, Healthcare -0.3%, Industrials -0.8%, Materials -1.8%, Tech -0.3%, Telecoms -0.7%, Utilities -1.1%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) shares jumped higher pre-market after the iPhone maker reported earnings that beat on both top and bottom-line expectations, guided revenue higher for the next quarter and Services revenue hit record highs; boosted dividend, and announced USD 75bln share buyback. L3 Technologies (LLL) rose on strong earnings, the defence technology co. beating analyst expectations for both revenue and profits. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) opened lower after earnings missed on the top and bottom-line expectations. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) opened higher after the chipmaker also beat analyst expectations on both top and bottom lines. Tesla (TSLA) fell throughout the session, weighed down by the news that the electric automaker would be sued by the family of a driver who had been killed in a Tesla Model X autopilot crash. CVS Health (CVS) shares jumped higher pre-market after the health care services co. reported earnings on both top and bottom lines. Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) reported strong earnings, beating revenue expectations, but gave away pre-market gains. Humana (HUM) fell after the health insurer announced that it expects earnings to come in below the long-term EPS target of 11-15% in 2020, despite reporting a beat on both top and bottom-line expectations for Q1 19. Home Depot (HD) fell after the company’s CFO of 18 years, Carol Tome, announced her retirement.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 3 TICKS LOWER AT 123-18+.</strong> USTs floundered at the start of the day on thin volumes ahead of the Fed, with modest starting gains surrendered following a better than expected ADP report, with some traders noting a large block flattener of over 13k FVM9s vs over 2K ultra longs. Thereafter, however, ISM manufacturing missed at 52.8 vs. exp. 55 which added upside to the complex, with a large block buyer of 8k USM9 calls noted. The meat of the day, however, was then the Fed’s decision, which saw the curve steepening and treasuries pushing higher, with increased volumes on the front end post the unchanged rate and IOER 5bps cut to 2.35%.&nbsp; Yields broke the 10th April 2.461% low, but the move was faded after Powell stated the “surprising” inflation prints could be transitory, and the IOER cut was purely “technical”. Thereafter the curve flattened and treasuries slipped to session lows heading into the close.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> weakened throughout morning trade prior to the FOMC, largely shrugging-off a substantial ADP employment data beat, subsequently seeing downside in the aftermath of lower than expected ISM manufacturing PMI data. The move reversed during the FOMC press conference after Fed Chair Powell said the recent fall in core inflation had been unexpected and was likely transitory, reiterating that he does not see the need to shift rates in either direction, while adding that the IOER cut was purely technical; DXY hit session highs in wake of his comments. <strong>EUR</strong>, trading in thin conditions due to European market holiday closure, shrugged-off weak Manufacturing PMI data from the Netherlands and gained throughout the morning in the afterglow of yesterday’s better than expected economic data in thin. Gains vs USD were extended after weak US ISM Manufacturing PMI data, but the days move was reversed during the FOMC press conference and EURUSD finished flat at just under 1.1200. <strong>GBP</strong> maintained yesterday’s momentum against most G10 counterparts, supported by a confluence of positive drivers, which included; Markit manufacturing PMI beating expectations, positive rhetoric regarding the state of cross-party Brexit negotiations (a Labour spokesperson said there was ‘clear evidence’ that the government is prepared to explore changes to their Brexit position) and a strengthening EUR. However, the day’s gains vs USD were reversed during the FOMC press conference and, much like EURUSD, GBPUSD finished the session relatively flat at around 1.3050. <strong>JPY</strong> traded mixed vs its major G10 counterparts, initially strengthening against USD and CAD (as both nations posted weak Manufacturing PMI data) and weakening vs EUR and GBP (as the European currencies maintained some of yesterday’s momentum from positive economic data). As with EUR and GBP, gains against USD were reversed during the FOMC press conference. <strong>CAD</strong> weakened with the crude complex, the latter coming under pressure after a large headline EIA crude inventory build, and was also weighed down by weak manufacturing PMI data. <strong>NZD</strong> was unable to recoup losses induced last night in the wake of poor employment numbers (which raise the prospect of a rate cut at the RBNZ meeting next week), trading lower vs USD and AUD.</p>",

        "content": "<p>As expected, the FOMC unanimously decided to hold the FFR target between 2.25-2.50%, though cut the IOER by 5bps to 2.35%. The statement saw the Fed acknowledged a \"solid\" rate of growth (upgrading its view, as expected), while pointing out that inflation -- both overall and core -- has eased , now downgrading its view to 'below 2%', while also dropping its reference to low rates being a function of low energy prices. The Fed noted that job gains have been solid, though growth of household spending and business fixed investment has slowed. Fed Chair Powell attempted to navigate a neutral line in his press conference, reiterating the messages of the statement, while emphasising the appropriateness of the Fed's policy stance, and the familiar message of neutral, seasoned with pateince. The Fed chair added that while business fixed investment and household spending had slowed, he sees it rebounding. Risks have moderated since the beginning of Q1, (data from China and Europe, disorderly Brexit pushed back, progress on trade talks with China, where the gains would be seen over time). Powell said the Fed was strongly committed to a symmetric inflation target; core inflation fall was unexpected, but likely transitory (this affirmation would prove to be the turning point during the presser, from a markets perspective). Powell says the policy stance is currently appropriate and does not see the case to shift rates in either directions (on a few occasions reiterating that the current policy stance was appropriate); he said the IOER was a technical adjustment that does not represent any shift in the Fed's policy stance; the FFR remains the central bank's primary policy tool; he also said that the Fed could look at the possibility of a repo facility at upcoming meetings. Fed Chair Powell was pressed on conditions that the Fed would need to see before considering cutting rates, though he seemed reticent to be drawn in, instead reiterating the Fed's policy targets. Asset prices were elevated, but not extremely so, though has some concern about corporate leverage; overall though, he does not see evidence of overheating. The FOMC had a discussion on the composition of the balance sheet; a decision will need to be taken at future meetings, and any changes will be telegraphed well in advance, Powell said.&nbsp;</p>",

The losses seen snapped back the gains earlier in the session, amid the ongoing concerns that protests in Venezuela to pressure President Maduro to step down may put around 800k bpd of crude oil production at risk; and this explains why Brent is performing slightly better than its WTI counterpart (both are negative, though). In other news, Iranian officials agreed that its oil sales could fall to between 300-400k BPD this Summer (vs. 2.5mln BPD in May 2018), according to WSJ, which also lent some positive ticks to Brent, ahead of the weekly US inventory data. However, Iraq is reportedly planning to boost crude oil exports from its Southern port to 3.45mln BPD, newswires said. Finally, Bloomberg's OPEC survey was released on Wednesday, and analysts see OPEC crude output rising +25K BPD to 30.3mln BPD in April, as Libya's gains offset losses from sanctions against Iran; on Tuesday, the comparable Reuters survey showed analysts expected OPEC oil output to fall by 90k BPD from March to 30.23mln BPD, which would be the lowest level since 2015.</p>",

The market will be watching whether the Fed outlines conditions that might compel the Committee to discuss lowering rates. There are some risks that the Fed might tweak its statement to reflect stronger growth and softer inflation since the last meeting. There is also a possibility the Fed could lower its IOER rate.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Only scant comfort and impetus derived from a bumper ADP survey and upward revision to the final April manufacturing PMI as the ISM missed by some distance and components were relatively downbeat alongside considerably weaker than forecast construction spending. Moreover, the Dollar continues to err on the side of caution into the FOMC amidst dovish expectations, as aside from speculation over an IOER cut (-5 bp), with the spread to Fed Funds holding at a record 5 bp, additional pressure from President Trump has upped the ante for a further shift in the language and/or guidance from the current pause with patience towards a possible ease. However, this may be premature and Chair Powell could refrain from major changes until June when the next SEP is published and the subject of inflation targeting is discussed earlier that month – full preview of the looming FOMC available via the Research Suite and to be flagged on the headline feed nearer the event. DXY just holding the base of a 97.265-543 range and a whisker above the 30 DMA (97.216).</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The clear G10 outperformers as the Franc rebounded further from recent lows vs the Usd through 1.0150 and Cable got to within a few pips of its 55 DMA (1.3090) amidst reports that the Conservative Party has been open to compromise on Brexit demand, albeit from a Labour spox, while the Pound is also gearing up for BoE super Thursday after the impending Fed (and again a detailed primer is on the Ransquawk Research Suite).</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>Also gleaning momentum and making more headway at the expense of the Buck as the single currency cleared or at least peered above decent technical resistance in the form of a 61.8% Fib and 30 DMA, both at 1.1242 before topping out just shy of 1.1250, while the Yen breached its 30 DMA (111.40) more convincingly to build on yesterday’s highs and inch closer to 111.00 (at 111.14).</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All bucking the broader trend and heading into the Fed on the back foot vs their US counterpart, as the Kiwi was undermined by a downbeat Q1 NZ employment report that lifted RBNZ easing expectations to 50%+ for the May 8 policy meeting. Nzd/Usd currently hovering between 0.6678-37 parameters and the Aussie partly down in sympathy, but also in wake of a bleak CBA manufacturing PMI, with Aud/Usd hovering near the bottom of a 0.7061-35 range and Aud/Nzd back below 1.0600. Meanwhile, the Loonie lost ground following a sub-50 Canadian manufacturing PMI within a 1.3412-1.3377 band, but appeared to stave off deeper declined with the aid of comments from Canada’s Trade Minister pledging to help Canola farmers feeling the adverse effects of China’s import ban. Carr also announced plans to send delegates to Japan and South Korea in June to promote trade in the product.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are also under pressure, with a more pronounced pull-back in oil prices weighing on the Nok and Sek seeing contagion losses allied to bearish technical impulses. Eur/Nok cloae to 9.7200 and Eur/Sek not far from 10.6900 vs 9.6705 and 10.6425 at the other extremes respectively.</p>",

Looking at bonds in more detail, the 10 year UK debt future has drifted back from 127.57 to 127.40 and its US counterpart is at 123-21 vs 124-24+ with the equivalent yield just crossing 2.50%.

The FTSE 100 (-0.1%) is relatively flat with sectors also showing no clear standouts. In terms of movers, Sainsbury’s (+4.7%) rose to the top of the index amidst optimistic revenue and profit numbers, alongside a net debt reduction which is ahead of target.

A broadly in line and less stockpile-inflated UK manufacturing PMI amidst mixed BoE mortgage and consumer data was largely shrugged off, but Sterling also eked more upside vs the Euro as the cross eased a bit further below 0.8600 to test bids just ahead of a 50% retracement (0.8583) following more reports about constructive cross party Brexit talks as discussions are put on hold due to Thursday’s local elections. More immediately, focus on the Fed before the BoE tomorrow – see the Ransquawk headline feed for detailed previews of the 2 events. Conversely, weaker than forecast NZ jobs data has raised the stakes in terms of RBNZ rate cut expectations for next week and Nzd/Usd retreated in response through 0.6650, as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounded firmly from around 1.0560 to just over 1.0600. However, the Kiwi has pared some losses since with the probability of an ease still close enough to 50% for reasonable doubt.</p><p><strong>CHF - </strong>Another major outperformer or rather beneficiary of a deeper pull-back in the Dollar ahead of the FOMC, as the Franc edges towards 1.0150 and DXY slips to 97.359, very close to a 97.355 Fib and nearer the 30 DMA (97.216).</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR - </strong>Also firmer vs the Greenback as Aud/Usd consolidates recovery gains around 0.7050 and the single currency builds a foothold above 1.1200. Eur/Usd has eclipsed Fib resistance at 1.1217 and is now approaching convergence at 1.1242 (another Fib and 30 DMA) before 1.1250 and 1.1275 (latter roughly coincides with the 50 DMA).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD - </strong>Both narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Yen attempts to breach the 30 DMA (111.40) and retest Tuesday’s peaks, while the Loonie continues its recovery from yesterday’s post-Canadian GDP lows within a 1.3400-1.3375 range in advance of the manufacturing PMI and more from BoC’s Poloz and Wilkins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Zealand Employment Change (Q1) Q/Q -0.2% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.1%).</strong> (Newswires) New Zealand Unemployment Rate (Q1) 4.2% vs. Exp. 4.2% (Prev. 4.3%) New Zealand Participation Rate (Q1) 70.4% vs. Exp. 70.9% (Prev. 70.9%) New Zealand Labour Cost Index (Q1) Q/Q 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.5%)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Pre-UK data and PMI price activity suggests some front-running or hedging for a bigger than forecast retracement in manufacturing activity, as the 10 year benchmark squeezed up to a new 127.41 Liffe intraday high (+9 ticks vs -10 ticks at worst), but then eased back on the release that was a smidge better than anticipated in the event. However, survey sub-components were less resilient after premature Brexit stock-building given the extended Article 50 deadline to October 31, and Gilts retain an underlying bid in keeping with USTs ahead of ADP, manufacturing PMI and ISM amidst various holidays that are weighing on turnover.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The energy market had a stellar performance in April as the benchmarks climbed over 6% amidst intensifying tensions in Venezuela, tightening US sanctions on Iran and ongoing OPEC supply cuts. Ahead of the end of Iranian oil waivers later, oil Journalist Reza Zandi notes that Iranian officials are reportedly discussing three potential Iranian scenarios in OPEC:&nbsp; 1) Iran suspends its membership in OPEC until sanctions are removed, 2) Iran departs from OPEC and 3) Iran continues its membership. In today’s trade, oil prices have reversed a bulk of the April gains following a much wider-than-forecast build in API crude stockpiles (6.8mln vs. Exp. 1.5mln), marking the 4th stock build in April. PVM analysts also highlight the uptrend in US stockpiles which is described as a “deepening pocket of weakness” amid a host of a bullish catalysts. WTI and Brent futures have thus retreated back below/around USD 64/bbl and USD 72/bbl respectively ahead of today’s EIA data wherein the market is geared for a headline build of 1.485mln barrels.&nbsp; Elsewhere, gold remains within a relatively tight range around 1280/oz ahead of the FOMC rate decision (preview available in the Research Suite) whilst copper mirrors the humdrum tone with most the region away on holiday. Finally, aluminium prices remain pressured following on from the weaker-than-forecast Chinese manufacturing data coupled with producers revising down their demand growth estimates for the year.</p><p>Abu Dhabi have launched a second bid round for 5 major exploration blocks which have substantial oil and gas potential., according to an ADNOC statement.

In terms of movers, Sainsbury’s (+4.7%) rose to the top of the index amidst optimistic revenue and profit numbers, alongside a net debt reduction which is ahead of target. To the downside, Persimmon (-1.4%) shares suffer after fire issues were found in houses developed by the company, the company is addressing the issue. State-side, Apple reported earnings aftermarket wherein the tech giant topped estimates on both top and bottom line, whilst Q3 guidance was also above analyst consensus, despite a sharp drop in Q2 iPhone sales. Apple shares spiked higher in excess of 5% post-earnings.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP/NZD</strong> - Flanking the G10 ranks at the start of the new month, as Cable extends gains through more chart resistance levels on the way to circa 1.3073, like the 30 DMA (1.3052), a Fib (1.3053) and daily tech formation (1.3065), eyeing 1.3090 next (55 DMA) before the 1.3100 handle. A broadly in line and less stockpile-inflated UK manufacturing PMI amidst mixed BoE mortgage and consumer data was largely shrugged off, but Sterling also eked more upside vs the Euro as the cross eased a bit further below 0.8600 to test bids just ahead of a 50% retracement (0.8583) following more reports about constructive cross party Brexit talks as discussions are put on hold due to Thursday’s local elections. More immediately, focus on the Fed before the BoE tomorrow – see the Ransquawk headline feed for detailed previews of the 2 events. Conversely, weaker than forecast NZ jobs data has raised the stakes in terms of RBNZ rate cut expectations for next week and Nzd/Usd retreated in response through 0.6650, as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounded firmly from around 1.0560 to just over 1.0600. However, the Kiwi has pared some losses since with the probability of an ease still close enough to 50% for reasonable doubt.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong> - Another major outperformer or rather beneficiary of a deeper pull-back in the Dollar ahead of the FOMC, as the Franc edges towards 1.0150 and DXY slips to 97.359, very close to a 97.355 Fib and nearer the 30 DMA (97.216).</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR</strong> - Also firmer vs the Greenback as Aud/Usd consolidates recovery gains around 0.7050 and the single currency builds a foothold above 1.1200. Eur/Usd has eclipsed Fib resistance at 1.1217 and is now approaching convergence at 1.1242 (another Fib and 30 DMA) before 1.1250 and 1.1275 (latter roughly coincides with the 50 DMA).</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD</strong> - Both narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Yen attempts to breach the 30 DMA (111.40) and retest Tuesday’s peaks, while the Loonie continues its recovery from yesterday’s post-Canadian GDP lows within a 1.3400-1.3375 range in advance of the manufacturing PMI and more from BoC’s Poloz and Wilkins.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Pre-UK data and PMI price activity suggests some front-running or hedging for a bigger than forecast retracement in manufacturing activity, as the 10 year benchmark squeezed up to a new 127.41 Liffe intraday high (+9 ticks vs -10 ticks at worst), but then eased back on the release that was a smidge better than anticipated in the event. However, survey sub-components were less resilient after premature Brexit stock-building given the extended Article 50 deadline to October 31, and <strong>Gilts</strong> retain an underlying bid in keeping with USTs ahead of ADP, manufacturing PMI and ISM amidst various holidays that are weighing on turnover.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The energy market had a stellar performance in April as the benchmarks climbed over 6% amidst intensifying tensions in Venezuela, tightening US sanctions on Iran and ongoing OPEC supply cuts. Ahead of the end of Iranian oil waivers later, oil Journalist Reza Zandi notes that Iranian officials are reportedly discussing three potential Iranian scenarios in OPEC:&nbsp; 1) Iran suspends its membership in OPEC until sanctions are removed, 2) Iran departs from OPEC and 3) Iran continues its membership. In today’s trade, oil prices have reversed a bulk of the April gains following a much wider-than-forecast build in API crude stockpiles (6.8mln vs. Exp. 1.5mln), marking the 4th stock build in April. PVM analysts also highlight the uptrend in US stockpiles which is described as a “deepening pocket of weakness” amid a host of a bullish catalysts. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures have thus retreated back below USD 64/bbl and USD 72/bbl respectively ahead of today’s EIA data wherein the market is geared for a headline build of 1.485mln barrels.&nbsp; Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> remains within a relatively tight range around 1280/oz ahead of the FOMC rate decision (preview available in the Research Suite) whilst <strong>copper</strong> mirrors the humdrum tone with most the region away on holiday. Finally, <strong>aluminium</strong> prices remain pressured following on from the weaker-than-forecast Chinese manufacturing data coupled with producers revising down their demand growth estimates for the year.</p>",

The Short Sterling strip is also on the defensive between 0.5 and 2 ticks below previous settlement levels in contrast to the firmer tone in UK stocks and the Pound as the FTSE is underpinned by some individual names rather than the usual inverse equity vs currency correlation. Ahead, a busy domestic agenda features BoE consumer and mortgage lending figures and the manufacturing PMI as the clock ticks down to the FOMC and BoE super Thursday. Back to Liffe, and from a technical standpoint 127.00-50 provide the obvious nearest support and resistance inside chart levels of 126.94 and 127.72 (Tuesday’s intraday base and apex).</p>",
