This downside has not been unexpected; recall, Goldman Sachs on the weekend provided a list of reasons why equities could see downside this week, without a specific headline catalyst (US/China risks were an identified risk); while others have suggested that the bear market rally is now over; that caution has been heard from some very influential investors too. Today, Appaloosa’s Tepper made similar warnings to those of Stan Druckenmiller yesterday, while recent commentary from BlackRock’s Fink and Berkshire Hathaway’s Buffett all seem to be calling into question the potential for large equity upside. The latest Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) update saw Uber discussing paying 1.9 shares for each GRUB share which would value the co. at USD 6bln or just over USD 60/shr, according to WSJ citing sources. However, the offer is slightly lower than what sources were suggesting yesterday (2 shares) and lower than what GRUB was said to be seeking. General Electric (GE) traded with heavy losses despite a lack of incremental news, although many are focusing on its struggling financial position in wake of the coronavirus. Intel (INTC) Capital has invested in two Chinese semiconductors start-ups, ProPlus, and Spectrum Materials. ProPlus makes EDA software that chipmakers use to design their products before manufacturing them and Spectrum Materials makes gases critical for semiconductor fabs to produce physical chips. Tesla (TSLA) can restart operations in Alameda County if guidance is followed. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) has dropped out of the USD 10bln casino project in Japan amid disagreements on licensing and tax terms. Mylan NV (MYL) announced a global collaboration with Gilead (GILD) to expand access to GILD’s experimental COVID treatment, remdesivir. MYL holds the rights to manufacture and distribute the treatment in 127 low-middle income countries. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is developing a new total COVID-19 antibodies test and will seek FDA emergency authorization and international approval for the test over the next few weeks; will begin manufacturing in the next few weeks. Uber (UBER) has rejected a 2.15 share ratio in GrubHub (GRUB) deal talks &amp; the companies remain at odds on price, sources tell CNBC. Barclays believes GRUB could be worth USD 75/shr in a sale. Caterpillar (CAT) 3-mth machine retail sales (end-Apr.): NA -27%, APAC -17%, LATAM -28%, World -22%. Intelsat (I) may reportedly file for its Chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon as tonight, some reports suggested. SPX -1.75% at 2820, NDQ -1.2% at 9000, DJIA -2.17% at 23,245.</p><p>The Treasury curve bull-flattened amid a souring of risk appetite (SPX sell-off), with yields falling lower despite the record Treasury 30-year issuance and other supply. T-Notes went into the US session with a modest bid, to then see a spike higher upon the Fed Chair Powell speech text release, which at first gave no mention to negative rates and said the Fed would use its tools “fully”, thus traders took this as a cue for somewhat of an endorsement for negative rates, as seen in the Fed Funds futures curve. However, when Powell was pressed in his Q&amp;A on the issue of NIRP, he made it clear that the Fed was not considering the policy, which saw a pushing-out of the NIRP pricing along the FF term structure. The bias on the day was for a flatter curve amid risk pressure, nonetheless, and the curve resumed its bull-flattening heading into the 30-year auction. The auction tailed the 1.334% WI by 0.8bps, although the internals weren’t bad given the Bond has been heavily bid in the past few session: covered 2.30x (vs avg. 2.40x), dealers took 21.38% (vs avg. 19.8%), indirects 65.69% (vs avg. 63.8%). Some desks draw attention to the recent cheapening of USD hedging costs, thus increasing the allure of USTs to international investors. Meanwhile, the deluge of corporate and Sovereign, Supranational and Agency issuance fails to remove the sails out of US duration bulls either, UnitedHealth came to the primary market with a USD 5bln offering. By settlement, the Treasury curve was flatter, with yields lower by a basis point or so at the front-end and down by over 4bps in the 30-year. US T-note futures (M0) settled 8+ ticks higher at 139-07.</p>",

Earnings: Deutsche Telekom</li></ul><h2><strong>MARKET WRAP</strong></h2><p>Equities endured another down day (ES printed sub 2,800 briefly), and the VIX jumped back higher rising into the 37s, moving out of contango; stock losses attributed to Fed chair Powell pushing back against the idea of negative US rates, and US/China tensions ramping up again ahead of November’s Presidential elections. This downside has not been unexpected; recall, Goldman Sachs on the weekend provided a list of reasons why equities could see downside this week, without a specific headline catalyst (US/China risks were an identified risk); while others have suggested that the bear market rally is now over; that caution has been heard from some very influential investors too. Today, Appaloosa’s Tepper made similar warnings to those of Stan Druckenmiller yesterday, while recent commentary from BlackRock’s Fink and Berkshire Hathaway’s Buffett all seem to be calling into question the potential for large equity upside. Meanwhile, bonds bull-flattened amid the negative risk tone (the long-end auction was lacklustre, tailing 0.8bps), the Dollar Index rose back above 100.00, gold made some progress above USD 1,700 after Powell. Retail sales and initial jobless claims are on the slate for Thursday.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>Tensions between US/China are clearly picking up; China's Foreign Ministry, on President Trump's efforts to push TSP fund to halt planned investments, said the wanton placement of obstructions on US investors runs counter to economic law; nevertheless, the US retirement investment board delayed the transition of USD 40bln international fund to track the MSCI index, including controversial Chinese equities, according to a statement, which cited COVID-19 and new board nominations as the reason behind the delay. Desks have been closely watching this aspect of the tensions; any restrictions on portfolio flows would be taken as a negative, and while this does not specifically call for the withdrawing of capital from Chinese equities, fund managers that track the index will be aware of the potential for disruptive flows. US President Trump, meanwhile, said dealing with China was \"a very expensive thing to do,\" and \"100 Trade Deals wouldn’t make up the difference\" for the downside that has come as a result of President Trump calling the coronavirus the \"China plague,\" a description likely to irritate the Chinese. However, there was also punchy rhetoric from China too; China's Global Times newspaper reported it would soon impose countermeasures on US individuals and entities filing lawsuits seeking COVID-19 damages from China, according to sources, and US states that were to sue China were highly likely to face business and trade consequences. Meanwhile, Huawei and ZTE were back in the frame, with US President Trump extending the executive order protecting the US supply chain from Huawei and ZTE for an additional year. The key takeaway is that US/China headline risk is firmly back now, and many desks are attributing developments as a key contribution (among other reasons) for why equities have seen downside over the last couple of days.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED CHAIR POWELL: </strong>While the <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/snap-analysis-powell-sticks-to-script-no-mention-of-negative-rates-in-the-text-says-fed-will-use-tools-to-the-fullest-and-again-urges-fiscal-action-13-05-2020\">initial text release</a> was largely in line with recent commentary, in his Q&amp;A, Fed Chair Powell pushed back against the idea of negative rates, which saw pricing of such a scenario push further out the Federal Funds Futures term structure. Powell again cited the mixed evidence on negative rates, though some traders noted that he used the caveat “for now” implying that the FOMC would likely want the option in its toolbox in the future. Some analysts have suggested that this line makes sense; the Fed would be able to exhaust other policy options first before resorting to more aggressive policies. The second stand out was that the Fed chair urged fiscal action; while this is not particularly new (he has said so many times recently), his remark that the Fed will be able to help companies with liquidity issues for a while, over time, more fiscal help will be needed; Powell also argued that now was not the time to debate debt and deficit levels (seemingly taking aim at some Republican lawmaker concerns). All in all, the message ultimately remains the same: The Fed is not going anywhere anytime soon, although fiscal authorities will need to step up eventually. Negative rates are not on the radar, but the market is retaining a non-zero chance of seeing them next year.</p><p><strong>ECB: </strong>ECB's de Guindos expects the eurozone economy to rebound in Q3 and Q4, expects growth of 6% in 2021, although the level of uncertainty is still very high and says it will take the eurozone two years to fully recover. De Guindos adds, Eurozone Banks will overcome the current crisis, although their results will suffer, adding banks will have to further reduce excess capacity and eventually embark on national and cross-border mergers within the EZ. ECB's chief economist Lane says low rates help, not hurt, banks. On the GCC, ECB, Bundesbank and German Gov't are reportedly attempting to find a face-saving way to defuse to danger from the GCC ruling on the Euro-Area integrity; Bundesbank could write the report or the ECB could but it would not be official, according to die Zeit's Schieritz. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Merkel stated they will respect the constitutional court's ruling on the ECB and the German government will answer questions from the EU Commission. Merkel added she wants a strong Euro, so will proceed in that sense going forward. ECB's Rehn reiterated other officials that the GCC does not instantly affect ECB monetary policy, but it is essential that the GCC agrees with EU top court that the PSPP does not breach the ban on public sector Central Bank funding.</p><p><strong>RBNZ: </strong>The RBNZ opted to keep its OCR at 0.25% and aggressively expanded its QE programme to NZD 60bln from NZD 33bln, as expected. Interestingly, the Board signalled openness towards a negative key rate, albeit the statement noted that now is not the time, so it reaffirmed its forward guidance that the “OCR would remain at 0.25% until early-2021”. Analysts at Westpac downplay the significance of the forward guidance and state that it will not stand in the way of NIRP if the situation requires it. That being said, at the presser, the RBNZ unveiled that it had asked banks to be on standby for negative rates by year-end. The Central Bank also noted that the purchase of foreign bonds is a possibility should more stimulus be required. Westpac forecasts the OCR to be reduced to -0.5% in November 2020 and remain comfortable with their NIRP forecast, but “timing is looking less certain”, the bank says.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 8+ TICKS HIGHER AT 139-07</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve bull-flattened amid a souring of risk appetite (SPX sell-off), with yields falling lower despite the record Treasury 30-year issuance and other supply. T-Notes went into the US session with a modest bid, to then see a spike higher upon the Fed Chair Powell speech text release, which at first gave no mention to negative rates and said the Fed would use its tools “fully”, thus traders took this as a cue for somewhat of an endorsement for negative rates, as seen in the Fed Funds futures curve. However, when Powell was pressed in his Q&amp;A on the issue of NIRP, he made it clear that the Fed was not considering the policy, which saw a pushing-out of the NIRP pricing along the FF term structure. The bias on the day was for a flatter curve amid risk pressure, nonetheless, and the curve resumed its bull-flattening heading into the 30-year auction. The auction tailed the 1.334% WI by 0.8bps, although the internals weren’t bad given the Bond has been heavily bid in the past few session: covered 2.30x (vs avg. 2.40x), dealers took 21.38% (vs avg. 19.8%), indirects 65.69% (vs avg. 63.8%). Some desks draw attention to the recent cheapening of USD hedging costs, thus increasing the allure of USTs to international investors. Meanwhile, the deluge of corporate and Sovereign, Supranational and Agency issuance fails to remove the sails out of US duration bulls either, UnitedHealth came to the primary market with a USD 5bln offering. By settlement, the Treasury curve was flatter, with yields lower by a basis point or so at the front-end and down by over 4bps in the 30-year</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLES USD 0.49 LOWER AT USD 25.29; WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 0.65 LOWER AT USD 25.68; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 0.79 LOWER AT USD 29.19</strong></p><p>Crude futures moved lower on Wednesday, taking their cues from wider risk aversion, despite the latest reassuring US inventory levels. Futures had been firmer overnight, catching some tailwinds after the private data suggested the Cushing hub had seen crude stocks draw for the first time in weeks – reducing concerns somewhat of storage reaching capacity ahead of June WTI expiry next Tuesday. The tone was reiterated in the official EIA data today, which even reported a surprise draw (albeit narrow) in total crude stocks, in addition to the 3mln bbls draw at Cushing; products were mixed, while crude production fell by 300k BPD to 11.6mln BPD. However, another acute sell-off in Spooz managed to weigh on the energy complex, bringing it into the red in the latter part of the session. Elsewhere, Politico reported that the White House has appealed the order to halt the Keystone XL pipeline construction. Iraq said it would bring total cuts to around 700k BPD, after agreeing with oil majors to cut production in Southern fields by 300k BPD. Saudi Arabia and Russia said they see signs of a recovery in oil demand and are confident OPEC+ partners are fully aligned with their goals.</p><p><strong>OPEC MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>2020 global oil demand growth forecast revised down by 2.23mln BPD from the prior report (Prev. cut of 6.9mln BPD), now forecast at 9.07mln BPD. The report reiterated that the worst contraction is expected to take place in Q2. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/opec-monthly-oil-market-report-may-2020-global-oil-demand-growth-forecast-revised-down-reiterates-worst-contraction-expected-to-take-place-in-q2-13-05-2020\">Click here for full report.</a></p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p>UK GDP: Q1 GDP metrics saw a decline of 2% Q/Q, which was slightly better than the anticipated decline of 2.5%, with the March-specific metric showing a contraction of 5.7% (exp. -8.0%); Some desks pointed out that the magnitude of the March decline was roughly the same amount of growth lost for the UK as seen during the peak-to-trough of the financial crisis. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the 2% contraction was not as severe as forecast by the MPC in its latest MPR, however, this could be a by-product of data collection quirks at the ONS where some data inputs were not available. Additionally, it is also worth considering the timing of the lockdown in the UK (23rd March) and therefore even the March-specific print will have only provided limited insight into the fragility of the UK economy. As such (and as is the case for most global economies), focus instead will likely fall more on the Q2 outturn, which Pantheon Macroeconomics suggests could see a Q/Q contraction of 20% even in the event that activity slowly begins to normalise towards the end of May. Framing a view of economic performance in Q2 will play a key role in assessing the shape of the eventual recovery in the UK with the prospect of a V-shaped recovery regarded to be in the rear-view mirror of many economists. Any further downside outcomes on this front will likely challenge the view of the BoE in its latest MPR that economic activity could return to pre-COVID-19 levels in H2 2021; some believe this is not likely until at least 2022.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.75% at 2820, NDQ -1.2% at 9000, DJIA -2.17% at 23,245</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -4.4%, Financials -3%, Communications -2.9%, Industrials -2.6%, Materials -2.2%, Technology -1.7%, Real Estate -1.6%, Discretionary -1.2%, Health Care -1.1%, Staples -0.9%, Utilities -0.9%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The latest Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) update saw Uber discussing paying 1.9 shares for each GRUB share which would value the co. at USD 6bln or just over USD 60/shr, according to WSJ citing sources. However, the offer is slightly lower than what sources were suggesting yesterday (2 shares) and lower than what GRUB was said to be seeking. General Electric (GE) traded with heavy losses despite a lack of incremental news, although many are focusing on its struggling financial position in wake of the coronavirus. Intel (INTC) Capital has invested in two Chinese semiconductors start-ups, ProPlus, and Spectrum Materials. ProPlus makes EDA software that chipmakers use to design their products before manufacturing them and Spectrum Materials makes gases critical for semiconductor fabs to produce physical chips. Tesla (TSLA) can restart operations in Alameda County if guidance is followed. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) has dropped out of the USD 10bln casino project in Japan amid disagreements on licensing and tax terms. Mylan NV (MYL) announced a global collaboration with Gilead (GILD) to expand access to GILD’s experimental COVID treatment, remdesivir. MYL holds the rights to manufacture and distribute the treatment in 127 low-middle income countries. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is developing a new total COVID-19 antibodies test and will seek FDA emergency authorization and international approval for the test over the next few weeks; will begin manufacturing in the next few weeks. Uber (UBER) has rejected a 2.15 share ratio in GrubHub (GRUB) deal talks &amp; the companies remain at odds on price, sources tell CNBC. Barclays believes GRUB could be worth USD 75/shr in a sale. Caterpillar (CAT) 3-mth machine retail sales (end-Apr.): NA -27%, APAC -17%, LATAM -28%, World -22%. Intelsat (I) may reportedly file for its Chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon as tonight, some reports suggested.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD: </strong>The DXY swung each side of the 100 figure with weakness heading into Fed Chair Powell’s speech, although as Powell pushed back on negative rates (which set the tone for the rest of the day) saw the dollar claw back gains and cross the 100 level to the upside, entering positive territory. Amid the Powell push back, ties between the US and China continue to fade amid reports of the US retirement investment board delaying the transition of USD 40bln international fund to track the MSCI index, which includes controversial Chinese companies, while further action has been taken against Huawei and ZTE, with the Chinese considering countermeasures on US individuals who file lawsuits seeking COVID-19 damages from China, all building a rather gloomy backdrop.</p><p><strong>HAVENS (JPY, XAU):</strong> With china/US relationships souring from multiple angles both JPY and XAU were bid, although price action was limited. Gains were likely also capped as Powell pushed back on negative rates, a tool which is normally supportive for both JPY and XAU due to rate differentials and real yields. Meanwhile, cyclical FX was weaker in the US session as risk sentiment continued to deteriorate amid growing US/China relationship concerns and Fed Chair Powell leaning on risk.</p><p><strong>NZD: </strong>The G10 underperformer after a dovish RBNZ rate decision which left its cash rate unchanged at 0.25%, while expanding its QE programme to NZD 60bln from NZD 33bln, while leaving the door open to negative interest rates; it however maintained forward guidance that the cash rate is to be at 0.25% until early 2021, while reiterating negative rates cannot be used currently due to operational issues at banks. Westpac notes that forward guidance is regularly updated, and thus feel comfortable keeping its own forecast that the OCR will fall to -0.5% in November.</p><p><strong>GBP, AUD: </strong>Sterling and the Aussie both saw similar losses against the rising buck today. GBP saw its GDP release this morning which fared ‘better’ than expected, as was IP, although overall still a grim report but support was provided to GBP. However, as risk sentiment soured and the dollar climbed, Sterling was pressured. Meanwhile, BoE Governor Bailey when asked about austerity policies said he hopes fiscal authorities will consider all choices, adding the BoE can help spread the cost out of COVID overtime. Bailey also reiterated a willingness to increase government bond purchases. AUD tracked risk appetite while looming Aussie/China concerns also contributing to the downside, though a big rise in Westpac’s consumer confidence index may have limited the downside.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (MXN, CAD): </strong>The crude complex saw downside today which weighed on petro-currencies, with EMs in general under the cosh. MXN, however, was the outlier and appreciated against the buck as its economy looks set to reopen while it has allowed automakers to resume production on May 18th. CAD was marginally weaker in fitting with risk appetite and crude prices. Scotiabank wrote if the risk backdrop were to improve could see USDCAD test 1.38/1.39, although if there were a sharp fall in equities, 1.41/1.42 could be seen. The desk, however, continues to expect CAD will remain around the 1.40 figure.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>EMFX was mixed, TRY continued its rebound and MXN benefitted from reopening news. Elsewhere BRL saw continued weakness and edged closer towards the 6.00 handle while Bolsonaro faces accusations from the former Justice Minister which, according to an Attorney General, if true, he would have been breaking multiple laws. The soured risk appetite today is also largely to blame for the EMFX hit.</p>",

T-Notes went into the US session with a modest bid, to then see a spike higher upon the Fed Chair Powell speech text release, which at first gave no mention to negative rates and said the Fed would use its tools “fully”, thus traders took this as a cue for somewhat of an endorsement for negative rates, as seen in the Fed Funds futures curve. However, when Powell was pressed in his Q&amp;A on the issue of NIRP, he made it clear that the Fed was not considering the policy, which saw a pushing-out of the NIRP pricing along the FF term structure. The bias on the day was for a flatter curve amid risk pressure, nonetheless, and the curve resumed its bull-flattening heading into the 30-year auction. The auction tailed the 1.334% WI by 0.8bps, although the internals weren’t bad given the Bond has been heavily bid in the past few session: covered 2.30x (vs avg. 2.40x), dealers took 21.38% (vs avg. 19.8%), indirects 65.69% (vs avg. 63.8%). Some desks draw attention to the recent cheapening of USD hedging costs, thus increasing the allure of USTs to international investors. Meanwhile, the deluge of corporate and Sovereign, Supranational and Agency issuance fails to remove the sails out of US duration bulls either, UnitedHealth came to the primary market with a USD 5bln offering. By settlement, the Treasury curve was flatter, with yields lower by a basis point or so at the front-end and down by over 4bps in the 30-year.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD: </strong>The DXY swung each side of the 100 figure with weakness heading into Fed Chair Powell’s speech, although as Powell pushed back on negative rates (which set the tone for the rest of the day) saw the dollar claw back gains and cross the 100 level to the upside, entering positive territory. Amid the Powell push back, ties between the US and China continue to fade amid reports of the US retirement investment board delaying the transition of USD 40bln international fund to track the MSCI index, which includes controversial Chinese companies, while further action has been taken against Huawei and ZTE, with the Chinese considering countermeasures on US individuals who file lawsuits seeking COVID-19 damages from China, all building a rather gloomy backdrop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HAVENS (JPY, XAU):</strong> With china/US relationships souring from multiple angles both JPY and XAU were bid, although price action was limited. Gains were likely also capped as Powell pushed back on negative rates, a tool which is normally supportive for both JPY and XAU due to rate differentials and real yields. Meanwhile, cyclical FX was weaker in the US session as risk sentiment continued to deteriorate amid growing US/China relationship concerns and Fed Chair Powell leaning on risk.</p><p><strong>NZD: </strong>The G10 underperformer after a dovish RBNZ rate decision which left its cash rate unchanged at 0.25%, while expanding its QE programme to NZD 60bln from NZD 33bln, while leaving the door open to negative interest rates; it however maintained forward guidance that the cash rate is to be at 0.25% until early 2021, while reiterating negative rates cannot be used currently due to operational issues at banks. Westpac notes that forward guidance is regularly updated, and thus feel comfortable keeping its own forecast that the OCR will fall to -0.5% in November.</p><p><strong>GBP, AUD: </strong>Sterling and the Aussie both saw similar losses against the rising buck today. GBP saw its GDP release this morning which fared ‘better’ than expected, as was IP, although overall still a grim report but support was provided to GBP. However, as risk sentiment soured and the dollar climbed, Sterling was pressured. Meanwhile, BoE Governor Bailey when asked about austerity policies said he hopes fiscal authorities will consider all choices, adding the BoE can help spread the cost out of COVID overtime. Bailey also reiterated a willingness to increase government bond purchases. AUD tracked risk appetite while looming Aussie/China concerns also contributing to downside, though a big rise in Westpac’s consumer confidence index may have limited the downside.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (MXN, CAD): </strong>The crude complex saw downside today which weighed on petro-currencies, with EMs in general under the cosh. MXN however was the outlier and appreciated against the buck as its economy looks set to reopen while it has allowed automakers to resume production on May 18th. CAD was marginally weaker in fitting with risk appetite and crude prices. Scotiabank wrote if the risk backdrop were to improve could see USDCAD test 1.38/1.39, although if there were sharp fall in equities, 1.41/1.42 could be seen. The desk however continues to expect CAD will remain around the 1.40 figure.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>EMFX was mixed, TRY continued its rebound and MXN benefitted from reopening news. Elsewhere BRL saw continued weakness and edged closer towards the 6.00 handle while Bolsonaro faces accusations from the former Justice Minister which, according to an Attorney General, if true, he would have been breaking multiple laws. The soured risk appetite today is also largely to blame for the EMFX hit.&nbsp;</p>",

The tone was reiterated in the official EIA data today, which even reported a surprise draw (albeit narrow) in total crude stocks, in addition to the 3mln bbls draw at Cushing; products were mixed, while crude production fell by 300k BPD to 11.6mln BPD. However, another acute sell-off in Spooz managed to weigh on the energy complex, bringing it into the red in the latter part of the session. Elsewhere, Politico reported that the White House has appealed the order to halt the Keystone XL pipeline construction. Iraq said it would bring total cuts to around 700k BPD, after agreeing with oil majors to cut production in Southern fields by 300k BPD.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>No mention of NIRP in the prepared text, but the concept was dealt with and denounced if not completely dismissed by the Fed chair during the Q&amp;A, as Powell stated no change in the very mixed evaluation of the efficacy of sub-zero rates and referred to prior FOMC minutes revealing that ‘all’ participants are opposed to negative Fed Funds. Hence, the <strong>DXY</strong> seems to have found a floor above 99.500 amidst broad Greenback recovery gains and the index is probing back above the 100.000 level that has been pivotal in May.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A real whip-saw Wednesday for the Kiwi, but perhaps crucially no loss of the 0.6000 handle vs the Buck even though the RBNZ has rekindled NIRP expectations via latest policy guidance that accompanied boosting QE and expanding the basket of purchases overnight. Perhaps decent option expiry interest at the strike kept Nzd/Usd underpinned, though the pair has retreated sharply from earlier recovery peaks and Aud/Nzd remains elevated within a wide 1.0780-1.0620 or so range even though the Aussie has relinquished 0.6500+ status against its US counterpart ahead of April’s labour report.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The standout G10 winner, with Eur/Nok finally breaching 11.0000 on a combination of bearish technical momentum and independent support for the Norwegian Krona via Norges Bank Governor Olsen reaffirming that this month’s 25 bp ease to 0% will likely be the final cut. However, the Swedish Crown’s post-Riksbank bull run has been hampered somewhat above 10.6000 vs the Euro in wake of deflationary CPI and CPIF readings that could convince the Bank to relent on its reluctance towards reversing its decision to lift the benchmark repo rate back to parity.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>Relative stability in oil after an unexpected draw in EIA crude stocks and more cohesive commentary from Russia and Saudi Arabia along the lines of expediting market rebalancing, not to mention both seeing signs of demand recovering, has protected the Loonie from losing too much ground vs its US rival. Indeed, Usd/Cad has been pretty confined between 1.4005-85 parameters and orbiting 1.4050 for the most part, like Eur/Usd around 1.0850 after inching closer to 1.0900 pre-Powell, Usd/Jpy either side of 107.00 and Usd/Chf in relation to 0.9700. Conversely, Sterling has underperformed across the board following fleeting reprieves on not quite as dire UK data as forecast and the aforementioned pre-Fed chair Dollar weakness, with Cable tripping stops circa 1.2250 and now through support ahead of 1.2200, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded from around 0.8809 to almost 0.8800.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Risk-off sentiment is weighing on most regional currencies, but the Try is holding above 7.0000 and Mxn welcoming plans to re-open the economy ahead of an expected ½ point Banxico rate cut tomorrow. However, the Brl remains beset with political issues and the economic fallout from COVID-19 that prompted the Government to slash its 2020 GDP and inflation estimates rather than getting any lasting relief from retail sales falling less than anticipated in March.</p>",

The Treasury curve is bull flattening (slightly), and bond traders are eyeing the 30-year auction this afternoon. Gold continues to consolidate around USD 1,700. NIH Director Fauci’s cautious comments cap optimism, while traders are cognizant of US/China risks, with talk on Capitol Hill of possible sanctions measures against the Chinese. Powell’s urging of fiscal action is also likely to keep attention on stimulus headlines.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors open in negative territory after steep declines yesterday. Defensives the relative outperformers (along with Technology) while Energy and Financials are leading the losses with the former weighed on by Exxon Mobil (XOM) after the ISS recommended shareholders vote against the separation of its CEO and Chairman roles. Financials likely weighed on from lower yields amid comments from Fed Chair Powell who noted the Fed will continue to use its tools to the fullest, while in the Q&amp;A he was noted the view of the committee has not changed in NIRP and it is not something being considered “for now”, suggesting it has not been completely ruled out which may be weighing on banks.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Intel (INTC) Capital has invested in two Chinese semiconductors start-ups, ProPlus, and Spectrum Materials. ProPlus makes EDA software that chipmakers use to design their products before manufacturing them and Spectrum Materials makes gases critical for semiconductor fabs to produce physical chips. Tesla (TSLA) can restart operations in Alameda County if guidance is followed. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) has dropped out of the USD 10bln casino project in Japan amid disagreements on licensing and tax terms. Mylan NV (MYL) announced a global collaboration with Gilead (GILD) to expand access to GILD’s experimental COVID treatment, remdesivir. MYL holds the rights to manufacture and distribute the treatment in 127 low-middle income countries. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is developing a new total COVID-19 antibodies test and will seek FDA emergency authorization and international approval for the test over the next few weeks; will begin manufacturing in the next few weeks. Uber (UBER) has rejected a 2.15 share ratio in GrubHub (GRUB) deal talks &amp; the companies remain at odds on price, sources tell CNBC. Barclays believes GRUB could be worth USD 75/shr in a sale. Caterpillar (CAT) 3-mth machine retail sales (end-Apr.): NA -27%, APAC -17%, LATAM -28%, World -22%.</p><p><strong>POWELL: </strong>While <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/snap-analysis-powell-sticks-to-script-no-mention-of-negative-rates-in-the-text-says-fed-will-use-tools-to-the-fullest-and-again-urges-fiscal-action-13-05-2020\">the text</a> was largely in line with recent commentary, in the Q&amp;A, Fed chair Powell pushed back against the idea of negative rates, which saw pricing of such a scenario push further out the Federal Funds Futures term structure. Powell again cited the mixed evidence on negative rates, though some traders noted that he used the caveat “for now” implying that the FOMC would likely want the option in its toolbox in the future. Some analysts have suggested that this line makes sense; the Fed would be able to exhaust other policy options first before resorting to more aggressive policies. The second stand out was that the Fed chair urged fiscal action; while this is not particularly new (he has said so many times recently), his remark that the Fed will be able to help companies with liquidity issues for a while, over time, more fiscal help will be needed; Powell also argued that now was not the time to debate debt and deficit levels (seemingly taking aim at some Republican lawmaker concerns). All in all, the message ultimately remains the same: The Fed is not going anywhere anytime soon, although fiscal authorities will need to step up eventually. Negative rates are not on the radar, but the market is retaining a non-zero chance of seeing them next year.</p><p><strong>ABOUT LAST NIGHT:</strong> The SPX fell in afternoon trade on Tuesday, backed by very little news flow. At the time, Treasuries were stable, as was oil in post-settlement trade, which has led some to suggest that the downside was a result of a chunky sell-side imbalance in thin market conditions; others suggested it was a result of cautious comments from NIH director Fauci, although the timing of the comments and market moves do not coincide. Nevertheless, the downside was not surprising to some, including analysts at Goldman Sachs; earlier in the week, we wrote about why this rally is unloved, and provided Goldman’s six reasons why the market could be in store for downside; 1) COVID infection rates outside of NY continue to rise, and may accelerate as lockdowns are lifted; 2) the restart process will take time; 3) bank loan loss reserves were built in Q1 based on a jobless rate of around 10% - that rate rose to 14.7% in April, and GS forecasts loan loss provisions will need to rise to USD 115bln in the next four quarters (versus total of USD 46bln in Q1); this may weigh on share repurchase/buybacks plans, shaking a key pillar of support that equities have enjoyed in the last decade; 4) dividends are at risk, and are seen falling further this year, as too are capex plans; 5) tax policy risk around elections; tax reforms in 2017 lowered corporation tax to 18% from 26%, and may become a political issue; 6) US/China risks, a headwind in 2019, are resurfacing.</p><p><strong>END OF BEAR MARKET RALLY:</strong> Nomura's quants think the bear market rally in equities has run its course, and we will now see a temporary market cool-down, as catalysts for a swing to genuine bullishness seem to be lacking, and stock market sentiment in the US is tracking its median recovery trajectory that it has historically seen after steep falls. Another reason Nomura offers is due to the way CTAs have started selling equity futures globally; its model shows CTAs cutting longs in S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures, and for the latter, the trigger line appears to be around 8,450, Nomura says. The model also suggests CTAs have growing shorts in Russell 2000 and Dow Jones futures. The bank suggests that there has been little FOMO from global macro hedge funds too in the latest rally, with these funds seeing opportunities for short-covering. \"We therefore think that chain-reaction selling of the sort that would pull DM equity markets down sharply looks unlikely,\" it caveats.</p><p><strong>DRUCKENMILLER: </strong>Influential investor Stan Druckenmiller delivered sobering comments to the Economic Club of NY aftermarket on Tuesday, suggesting that the risk-reward for equities was as bad as he's ever seen it in his career, and stocks were historically overvalued. He also argued that markets were overreacting to the progress of anti COVID treatments. Druckenmiller also does not buy into the theory that the Fed has the market's back (i.e. has backstopped the downside), and argued that what we were seeing is not capitalism. He also warned of bankruptcies ahead, in addition to more regulation and higher taxes ahead due to COVID.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>WATCH LIVE: </strong>The event can be <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/events/economic-update-fed-chair-jerome-h-powell\">streamed online</a> via the Peterson Institute.</p><p>Powell’s remarks are likely to be a reiteration of his post-FOMC <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/fomc-press-conference-summary-powell-reiterates-support-suggests-the-fed-could-do-more-and-says-fed-is-in-no-hurry-to-withdraw-support-29-04-2020\">comments</a> on 29th April. However, there are a few key themes we will be paying close attention to:</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong> Last week, some Federal Funds Futures contracts rose above par, signalling a modest but non-zero probability that the US will see negative rates. Fed officials including Powell have largely pushed back against this notion both recently and historically, stating it would not be an appropriate policy in the US. However, some officials (like dovish voter Kashkari), while not favouring the policy, have not completely ruled it out in the future. And then there is the political pressure from US President Trump, who has previously given mixed signals, this week called negative rates a “gift”. While Powell will likely argue against the policy again, analysts will be watching how aggressively he does so; leaving any optionality to use the policy in the future will likely keep those Fed Funds futures next year pricing some probability of negative rates, albeit moderate for now. In terms of market reaction,<strong> </strong>negative rates, while assumed to be dollar negative, might not be as negative as first perceived, Credit Suisse says; the bank notes USD-negative repercussions may be limited by the fact that most other major central banks will also be toying with negative rates and QE policies. For equities, when those FF futures began rising above par, it stoked equity upside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>YCC:</strong> Analysts believe that the Fed will eventually announce a yield curve control policy to put a lid on shorter-dated yields, and it could be used in combination with a pledge to keep rates low for a long, long time. This would keep rates low for both businesses and consumers during the recovery phase, but also provide favourable conditions for the US government to borrow at low levels to finance relief measures. Many think that the Fed would likely exhaust policies like YCC before resorting to negative rates. While the expectation is that such a policy might be announced at the June FOMC, some suggest it will still be a while before the Fed is ready to implement it. Accordingly, any commentary about timelines will be of use. BMO's analysts have suggested that a YCC policy would help the curve steepen out (short-end yields anchored by the Fed guidance and yield control, while longer-dated yields would rise on large Treasury issuance and the theoretical inflation and growth that recent stimulus fosters).</p><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> The Fed chair is likely to reiterate that both fiscal and monetary authorities will need to do more to ensure that the recovery is robust. His remarks will be interesting given that Democrats in the House unveiled Stimulus v4.0, which Republicans have pushed back against, preferring to see how current measures play out before launching further largesse.</p><p>A recap of the April FOMC meeting and press conference can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/fomc-press-conference-summary-powell-reiterates-support-suggests-the-fed-could-do-more-and-says-fed-is-in-no-hurry-to-withdraw-support-29-04-2020\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/instant-analysis-fomc-pivots-to-limitless-asset-purchases-29-04-2020\">here</a>.</p>",

To recap, QE was increased to Nzd 60 bn from Nzd 33 bn, as widely expected, and linkers will now be included in the asset purchase remit, but rate guidance was considerably more dovish than many envisaged to leave Nzd/Usd hovering just above the round number and Aud/Nzd not far from 1.0800 compared to around 1.0620 at one stage before the policy meeting.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>SNAPSHOT:</strong> Asian equities were mixed overnight, Europe is in the red, although US equity futures have come off overnight lows after the hefty slide in late Tuesday trade (see below for theories). The Treasury curve is biased towards bull-flattening ahead of Powell and long-end supply. The dollar is slightly lower; activity currencies are performing well except for NZD (its central bank doubled QE and hinted at negative rates), the GBP printed ‘better’ than expected GDP. EMFX is mixed, while gold continues to consolidate around USD 1,700. NIH Director Fauci’s cautious comments cap optimism, while traders are cognizant of US/China risks, with talk on Capitol Hill of possible sanctions measures against the Chinese.</p><p><strong>POWELL AHEAD (0900 ET/1400 BST):</strong> Powell’s remarks are likely to be a reiteration of his post-FOMC comments on 29th April. However, there are a few key themes we will be paying close attention to: negative rates, yield curve control, and fiscal stimulus. We have put together a primer <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-fed-chair-powell-to-speak-on-the-economy-at-0900-et-1400-bst-13-05-2020\">here</a> explaining the nuances of the themes, and how markets are likely to react.</p><p><strong>ABOUT LAST NIGHT:</strong> The SPX fell in afternoon trade on Tuesday, backed by very little news flow. At the time, Treasuries were stable, as was oil in post-settlement trade, which has led some to suggest that the downside was a result of a chunky sell-side imbalance in thin market conditions; others suggested it was a result of cautious comments from NIH director Fauci, although the timing of the comments and market moves do not coincide. Nevertheless, the downside was not surprising to some, including analysts at Goldman Sachs; earlier in the week, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/us-equity-open-note-indices-open-in-negative-territory-health-care-the-only-sector-in-the-green-11-05-2020\">we wrote about</a> why this rally is unloved, and provided Goldman’s six reasons why the market could be in store for downside; 1) COVID infection rates outside of NY continue to rise, and may accelerate as lockdowns are lifted; 2) the restart process will take time; 3) bank loan loss reserves were built in Q1 based on a jobless rate of around 10% - that rate rose to 14.7% in April, and GS forecasts loan loss provisions will need to rise to USD 115bln in the next four quarters (versus total of USD 46bln in Q1); this may weigh on share repurchase/buybacks plans, shaking a key pillar of support that equities have enjoyed in the last decade; 4) dividends are at risk, and are seen falling further this year, as too are capex plans; 5) tax policy risk around elections; tax reforms in 2017 lowered corporation tax to 18% from 26%, and may become a political issue; 6) US/China risks, a headwind in 2019, are resurfacing.</p><p><strong>END OF BEAR MARKET RALLY: </strong>Nomura's quants think the bear market rally in equities has run its course, and we will now see a temporary market cool-down, as catalysts for a swing to genuine bullishness seem to be lacking, and stock market sentiment in the US is tracking its median recovery trajectory that it has historically seen after steep falls. Another reason Nomura offers is due to the way CTAs have started selling equity futures globally; its model shows CTAs cutting longs in S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures, and for the latter, the trigger line appears to be around 8,450, Nomura says. The model also suggests CTAs have growing shorts in Russell 2000 and Dow Jones futures. The bank suggests that there has been little FOMO from global macro hedge funds too in the latest rally, with these funds seeing opportunities for short-covering. \"We therefore think that chain-reaction selling of the sort that would pull DM equity markets down sharply looks unlikely,\" it caveats.</p><p><strong>DRUCKENMILLER:</strong> Influential investor Stan Druckenmiller delivered sobering comments to the Economic Club of NY aftermarket on Tuesday, suggesting that the risk-reward for equities was as bad as he's ever seen it in his career, and stocks were historically overvalued. He also argued that markets were overreacting to the progress of anti COVID treatments. Druckenmiller also does not buy into the theory that the Fed has the market's back (i.e. has backstopped the downside), and argued that what we were seeing is not capitalism. He also warned of bankruptcies ahead, in addition to more regulation and higher taxes ahead due to COVID.</p><p><strong>LONG-END SUPPLY:</strong> A more significant concession might be appropriate for today’s 30-year auction, relative to the 10-year supply, BMO believes, noting within the 1.35-1.40% range, the 30-year sector has continued to underperform the balance of the curve, which has led to re-steepening particularly in 2s10s and 5s30s; BMO believes more steepening could be in store as a result of the front-end of the curve being anchored to monetary policy expectations, and the second wave of steepening is likely to occur when evidence of upward pressure on inflation is seen; for the time being, the probability of inflation expectations spiking any time soon is limited. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-treasury-to-auction-3-year-on-mon-10-year-on-tue-30-year-on-wed-bias-is-towards-a-steeper-curve-analysts-say-11-05-2020\">Preview here</a>.</p>",

Meanwhile, the single currency and Swiss Franc have also lost momentum amidst the broad Buck revival, with Eur/Usd unable to challenge yesterday’s best and straddling 1.0850, Usd/Chf over 0.9700 again and Eur/Chf slightly firmer within a 1.0517-28 band, in contrast to the Yen that has rediscovered its safe-haven allure and eyeing 107.00 resistance and offers.</p><p>EM - Perhaps the most poignant test so far of the Lira’s new found power to resist bearish impulses as Usd/Try remains below the psychological 7.0000 level even though Turkey’s current account shortfall surpassed forecasts and almost quintupled in March from the previous month to a near 2 year wide deficit.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s been a slow grind from mixed starting points, but the midweek session is panning out much more positively for bonds across the board.

Prices waned off OPEC sources highs potentially on worries surrounding US-Sino relations, but participants note that concerns over hitting storage capacity have eased as demand gradually recovers, whilst supply cuts also provides a less bearish outlook vs. March. Yesterday’s API printed a larger-than-expected build of 7.6mln barrels vs. Exp. 4.1mln, but Cushing saw a draw of 2.216mln barrels – traders will be eyeing today's DoEs for confirmation. Looking at the WTI forward curve, a chunk of open interest resides in the December 20 contract – reflecting funds’ moves from front-month to further down the line. Elsewhere, EIA STEO cut 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 2.9mln BPD to a decline of 8.13mln BPD Y/Y and its 2021 world oil demand forecast was cut by 580k BPD to 6.99mln BPD Y/Y increase, while it sees inventories to begin drawing in July 2020 and with draws continuing through the end&nbsp; of 2021. The OPEC MOMR will be released later today. <strong>WTI</strong> June and <strong>Brent</strong> July both meander off session lows of USD 25.10/bbl (vs. high USD 25.81/bbl) and USD 28.92/bbl (vs. high USD 29.69/bbl) respectively. Meanwhile, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains lacklustre in a tight USD 6/oz range on either side of 1700/oz, awaiting Fed Chair Powel’s speech on current economic issues at 1400BST. <strong>Copper</strong> prices meanwhile initially extended on losses amid concerns on the US-China trade front coupled by resurfacings COVID-19 cases in some countries believed to have been “success stories”.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>WATCH LIVE: </strong>The event can be <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/events/economic-update-fed-chair-jerome-h-powell\">streamed online</a> via the Peterson Institute.</p><p>Powell’s remarks are likely to be a reiteration of his post-FOMC <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/fomc-press-conference-summary-powell-reiterates-support-suggests-the-fed-could-do-more-and-says-fed-is-in-no-hurry-to-withdraw-support-29-04-2020\">comments</a> on 29th April. However, there are a few key themes we will be paying close attention to:</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong> Last week, some Federal Funds Futures contracts rose above par, signalling a modest but non-zero probability that the US will see negative rates. Fed officials including Powell have largely pushed back against this notion both recently and historically, stating it would not be an appropriate policy in the US. However, some officials (like dovish voter Kashkari), while not favouring the policy, have not completely ruled it out in the future. And then there is the political pressure from US President Trump, who has previously given mixed signals, this week called negative rates a “gift”. While Powell will likely argue against the policy again, analysts will be watching how aggressively he does so; leaving any optionality to use the policy in the future will likely keep those Fed Funds futures next year pricing some probability of negative rates, albeit moderate for now. In terms of market reaction,<strong> </strong>negative rates, while assumed to be dollar negative, might not be as negative as first perceived, Credit Suisse says; the bank notes USD-negative repercussions may be limited by the fact that most other major central banks will also be toying with negative rates and QE policies. For equities, when those FF futures began rising above par, it stoked equity upside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>YCC:</strong> Analysts believe that the Fed will eventually announce a yield curve control policy to put a lid on shorter-dated yields, and it could be used in combination with a pledge to keep rates low for a long, long time. This would keep rates low for both businesses and consumers during the recovery phase, but also provide favourable conditions for the US government to borrow at low levels to finance relief measures. Many think that the Fed would likely exhaust policies like YCC before resorting to negative rates. While the expectation is that such a policy might be announced at the June FOMC, some suggest it will still be a while before the Fed is ready to implement it. Accordingly, any commentary about timelines will be of use. BMO's analysts have suggested that a YCC policy would help the curve steepen out (short-end yields anchored by the Fed guidance and yield control, while longer-dated yields would rise on large Treasury issuance and the theoretical inflation and growth that recent stimulus fosters).</p><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> The Fed chair is likely to reiterate that both fiscal and monetary authorities will need to do more to ensure that the recovery is robust. His remarks will be interesting given that Democrats in the House unveiled Stimulus v4.0, which Republicans have pushed back against, preferring to see how current measures play out before launching further largesse.</p><p>A recap of the April FOMC meeting and press conference can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/fomc-press-conference-summary-powell-reiterates-support-suggests-the-fed-could-do-more-and-says-fed-is-in-no-hurry-to-withdraw-support-29-04-2020\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/instant-analysis-fomc-pivots-to-limitless-asset-purchases-29-04-2020\">here</a>.</p>",

Meanwhile, Eurozone periphery bonds are still caught between the cross-fire of GCC and ECB squabbling on the legalities of QE, with Italian BTPs may also be making room for multi-tranche auctions. Hence, the 10 year German benchmark has recovered more poise after yesterday’s sell-off to a new 172.80 trough for May and is holding in a 173.44-64 range vs its 173.37 Eurex close. Ahead, Eurozone ip is certain to miss consensus given worse than forecast national data, ECB speakers and German supply after the aforementioned Italian debt offerings.</p>",

Treasuries had been richening ahead of the record size 10-year auction, supported by a 0.8% M/M decline in April CPI, in addition to equity downside as US futures struggled to break key resistance levels after the cash open. The USD 32bln 10-year auction stopped through the 0.712% WI by 1.2bps, covered 2.69x (vs average 2.46x), while dealers took just 20.52% (vs average 26.3%) – a successful all-round auction amid the new record refunding. Note that concession for the auction may have already taken place in prior sessions, in which the 10-year yield had risen from lows of 61bps on Friday to 70bps at the time of today’s auction. The Fed’s activeness in the market may have also limited pushing yields much further, despite the 30-year auction on Wednesday and the continued deluge of corporate deals; not to mention the new 20-year maturity arriving next week. Post the auction, duration continued to catch a bid after reports that GOP Senators had introduced new China sanctions legislation due to its treatment of Uighur Muslims.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are lower across the board following the late slump on Wall St. with sentiment soured by fears of a 2nd coronavirus wave and after efforts in the US Senate to impose sanctions on China. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) are lower with the Australian benchmark suffering from the withered ties with China and amid broad losses across its sectors including financials after the largest bank CBA reported a drop in cash profit and spike in loan impairment expenses, while sentiment in Tokyo is pressured by a firmer currency and with a slew of earnings releases dominating local newsflow. Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are both lacklustre as US-China concerns were stoked by reports US Republican Senators proposed legislation which would empower President Trump to impose sanctions on China if it does not provide a \"full accounting\" for the coronavirus outbreak and Senator Cruz introduced legislation to incentivize mining companies to produce in the US and electronic manufacturers to use US based rare earths over China imports, while the Senate is also planning to move on legislation that would impose sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY nurses the prior day’s weakness and attempts a reclaim of the 100.00 level which is proving to be a stubborn resistance, with the greenback also not helped by the temperamental US-China headlines and concerns of a second coronavirus wave after NIH’s Fauci warned of serious consequences from opening too soon. EUR/USD is rangebound around 1.0850 with the pair surrounded by several moving average levels including its 200-Hour MA and GBP/USD is stuck near the prior day’s lows after Chancellor Sunak extended the furlough scheme for 4 months and with UK reportedly on course for a GBP 337bln budget deficit this year. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was restricted by the lack of risk appetite which also hampered antipodeans currencies, while losses in NZD/USD were exacerbated after the RBNZ policy decision in which it kept the OCR at 0.25% and boosted its Large Scale Asset Purchases programme to NZD 60bln as expected which will now include inflation-indexed government bonds. The central banks also struck an overtly dovish tone and noted that negative rate will become an option in the future and that it preferred an approach of delivering stimulus sooner rather than later.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with the gains in T-notes, weakness in stocks and BoJ presence in the market for JPY 810bln of JGBs all failing to spur prices.</p>",
