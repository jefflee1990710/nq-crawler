Although the headline gives the appearance of a blockbuster report, Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that the jump in payroll growth appears to be a correction following the modest 147k added in December. \"The gains in recent months have all been outside manufacturing, where payrolls fell by 12K in January, the worst month since August 2016; the trend clearly is deteriorating, with the sector under pressure from the trade war.\" Pantheon notes that manufacturing accounts for only 8.4% of payrolls, but it punches above its weight in the eyes of the markets. Looking ahead, Pantheon says that surveys continue to point to substantially slower payroll growth, but the hard data have outperformed substantially in recent months and show no signs yet of fading. \"Even so, January’s jump in payrolls likely will be followed by a significantly smaller increase in February, as favourable weather effects fade and healthcare job growth mean-reverts.\" The data showed the unemployment rate rising by one-tenth to 3.6% as participation rose. \"The uptick in unemployment likely means nothing; the household survey reports an implausible 89K drop in employment, which makes no sense and will reverse,\" PM writes, \"the survey is much less reliable than the payroll numbers, but it tends to tell the same story over time. If job growth is sustained at anything like its recent pace, the unemployment rate will fall over the next few months.\" Meanwhile, average hourly earnings fell short on a M/M basis at 0.2%, though the Y/Y topped expectations at 3.1% Y/Y. \"We wonder if the key response of businesses to the intensification of the trade war in the summer was to be more aggressive in pay negotiations; if so, we doubt it can last as labor shortages become more acute,\" PM said.</p><p><strong>* FED SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT REVIEW: </strong>There was nothing particularly new within the Fed’s semi-annual statement to Congress, which largely borrowed from the January FOMC statement and the subsequent press-conference from Chair Powell. It noted that the US economy grew at a moderate rate last year, while the labour market strengthened and inflation continued to run below target (boring the Fed’s new statement language), and the probability of a recession in the US occurring in the next year has fallen noticeably in recent months. The Fed noted that while downside risks to the outlook have receded at the end of 2019 (easing of China trade tensions, looser financial conditions and stabilising growth), it did note that there is the potential for uncertainty from the coronavirus outbreak. Elsewhere, the report also reiterated Chair Powell’s view that the global manufacturing bottom appears to be nearing an end and borrowed from Powell on asset valuation and debt are elevated, though leverage in the financial sector appears low by historical norms. Finally, it noted that money market conditions were calm over year-end, after the Fed added liquidity.</p><p><strong>* CANADA JOBS: </strong>In January, Canada added 34.5k jobs, beating expectations for a rise of 15k. The previous, however, was revised lower to 27.3k from 35.2k, according to Scotia. Adding strength to the report, is that it was primarily driven by full time jobs, boding well for the report, which saw part time jobs fall 1.2k. Hourly wages were also firm, rising 4.4%, up from December’s 3.8%. The report initially saw CAD strength, even against the buck, which saw a solid jobs report. However, gains were short lived and USDCAD reverse course to pre-announcement levels. Scotia writes on the report that to be confident in the underlying trend, more evidence of jobs is needed, highlighting only 4,200 jobs have been created in the last four months, which includes November’s fall. The desk highlights that the report occurred in a period of little to no growth in the economy, and that “it is unclear whether that signals a rebound in future growth, or a continued overshoot in the job growth trend that faces downside risk.”</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The rate of growth of the number of new cases reported fell overnight for the first time, reinforcing the market's perception that the outbreak can be contained; additionally, desks have noted that only two fatalities from the virus have been seen outside of China. Traders will continue to monitor the metrics to confirm signs that the peak may be in (naturally, there is some market scepticism over the data that the Chinese provide). From a policy perspective, China's central bank has supported the market with liquidity and looser policy this week; overnight, the PBOC said it judged the impact of the virus as temporary, but added that if the fallout accelerates, then it was prepared to step in again with further support. PBOC Deputy Governor, cited by Global Times, stated that the Central Bank set to substantially cut the interest rate on medium-term lending facilities and bring down the loan prime rate when announcing its next quotations for the two key loan rates. Other policymakers overnight also flagged the potential of a hit to Q1 economic metrics in China, though are confident of a rapid recovery when the outbreak has been contained. However, data may not be as useful for China in the months ahead; the trade data for Jan/Feb, for instance, will be combined and delayed, as collating the data with a lack of personal becomes challenges, and also hints we may see similar regarding other data due for release. Meanwhile, rating agencies have also been trimming their estimate of Chinese growth this year, with S&amp;P (to 5.0% from 5.7%), and Fitch (from 5.9% to 5.2-5.7%) updating on Friday, highlighting that sentiment is clearly fragile in the European morning with further reports of the virus outside of china, and HK extending</p><p><strong>* KUDLOW: </strong>NEC director Kudlow highlighted a new urgency on talks with Europe, noting new proposals have been put on the table which could lead to positive developments, whilst adding that talks on auto imports are on hold while they work through a good faith effort with the EU. On the coronavirus, Kudlow expects an “absolutely minimal” impact on the US economy; noting it could cut US GDP growth by 0.2ppts.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.55% at 3327, Dow -0.94% at 29,103, NDX -0.47% at 9,401.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Staples +0.18%, Communication Services +0.11%, Real Estate +0.05%, Consumer Discretionary -0.29%, Utilities -0.31%, Financials -0.36%, Industrials -0.70%, Energy -0.75%, Health -0.81%, Technology -0.98%, Materials -1.46%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>AbbVie (ABBV) made solid gains after a decent quarter and rosy guidance. Uber (UBER) surged as it moves further to profitability than had been anticipated. Take-Two (TTWO) tumbled lower following a weak quarter. FleetCor Technologies (FLT) was sold on lower than expected FY20 guidance. Canada Goose (GOOS) also suffered as it warned of China demand issues due to the coronavirus. T-Mobile (TMUS) was bid on a decent quarter, net additions and profit guidance. Other stocks which traded higher after earnings reports included ATVI, NLOK, PINS, NOV, FTV. Meanwhile, stocks that sold off after their reports included VRSN, WYNN, CBOE, FTNT, DXC.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) pared some of its recent losses after it confirmed it was no longer in merger talks with eBay (EBAY), seeing EBAY shares move lower. Cruise liners (RCL, CCL, NCLH) were offered amid the coronavirus, with some cruises themselves reportedly quarantined as passengers tested positive. Further to the point, VF Corp (VFC) warned ahead of its earnings that the coronavirus would negatively. Meanwhile, Moderna (MRNA) surged higher after US health regulators announced that so far there had been no “glitches” on the Co’s vaccine development. Elsewhere, Fidelity National (FNF) sold off after it announced it is to acquire FGL Holdings (FG) for USD 2.7bln. KKR (KKR) is reportedly working with JPMorgan (JPM) on an USD 8bln bid for Coty’s (COTY) professional beauty products division, Sky News reported. Softbank (SFTBY) sold off on reports in the WSJ that its latest fund is struggling to raise an adequate level of capital.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 0.63 LOWER AT USD 50.32/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLED USD 0.46 LOWER AT USD 54.47/BBL: </strong>The crude complex continued its move lower to end the week, although WTI found support just above the USD 50/bbl handle, and Brent above USD 54/bbl, where they remained for the rest of the session, marking the fifth consecutive week of losses to levels not seen since early January 2019. Participants are still awaiting an official announcement from OPEC+, as Russia’s Energy Minister Novak stated that more time is needed to assess the coronavirus situation and its impact on the oil market, noting next week the decision will be made for its position on the OPEC+ meeting due next month – the lack of decision is causing some anxiety among participants on whether a significant action will be taken. Elsewhere, Russia’s Energy Minister Novak stated that global oil demand may drop by 150-200k BPD in 2020 compared to 2019, due to uncertainties in Libya, Iran and Venezuela. Analysts at PVM highlighted that in the past Russia have resisted initially but eventually will change to be in line with OPEC and non-OPEC allies. PVM note the same is expected in this case, especially as Foreign Minister Lavrov expressed support for the proposed production cuts. Elsewhere, the latest Platts survey found OPEC crude output fall 470k BPD in January, where Libya production hit an 18 month low due to the ongoing blockades, whereas Iraq output rose after four months of improving compliance and total compliance for 10 members with quotas stood at 128%. This week’s Baker Hughes US rig count saw oil rigs +1 at 676, natural gas -1 at 111, leaving the total unchanged at 790.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 16+ TICKS HIGHER AT 131-02+:</strong> The Treasury curve bull-flattened on Friday, ahead of the weekend, amid coronavirus concerns overshadowing the strong US January jobs report. The T-Note was initially offered on the headline NFP print (+225k vs. exp. +160k), with desks noting an “algo drilled” move lower before real money and CTAs swiftly moving into cover shorts, prompting the reversal higher. Participants are likely eager to reduce their risk exposure over the weekend; a growing chorus of US corporates have been noting potential financial impacts from the coronavirus in their guidance and the number of cases/deaths continues to rise in China, seeing further quarantine measures in the APAC region. One desk highlights the bull flattening particularly interesting ahead of the duration-heavy Treasury issuance next week (3s, 10s and 30s), which, ceteris paribus, would lead to a bear steepener. By settlement, the 10-year yield had fallen by just north of 6bps to 1.58%, with the curve generally flatter: 2s5s -1.3bps, 2s10s -1.6bps, 2s30s -1.8bps.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: </strong><i>Dollar reigns, as coronavirus spreads and risk sentiment sours</i></p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>Barring a major upset or change in the tide, the Greenback remains on course to extend its run of consecutive daily gains to a full trading week, with only a few interludes along the way and just a minor blip to digest the details of January’s jobs report. In sum, the payroll tally surpassed expectations and y/y average earnings were firmer than forecast in contrast to the m/m print and unemployment rate. Nevertheless, the data does not alter the narrative and after upbeat ISM surveys (in headline terms if not all sub-components) is highly unlikely to alter the near term Fed policy outlook in the run up to the semi-annual report and next week’s testimonies by chair Powell. Hence, the DXY remains elevated between 97.429-98.672 parameters, albeit off best levels as certain G10 currency counterparts stage a late comeback amidst ongoing Chinese nCoV, Brexit and geopolitical jitters.</p><p><strong>* AUD/NZD: </strong>In stark contrast to their US peer, the Aussie and Kiwi are both staring at hefty net declines and closes closer to the bottom of 0.6774-0.6663 and 0.6502-0.6404 respective ranges. Aud/Usd did receive some respite from the RBA earlier in the week when the OCR was maintained and GDP forecasts were only modestly tweaked, but the latest SOMP was less upbeat with 2020 growth downgraded on the base-line assumption that rates will be cut by another 25 bp. However, the real bugbear for the Aussie and Kiwi that gleaned little in the way of independent impetus from a rather mixed NZ employment release ahead of February’s RBNZ policy meeting next Wednesday was the mounting tally and widening spread of China’s coronavirus, with economic fallout by contagion or association.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Friday’s G10 outperformer as broad risk appetite waned and the Yen clawed back lost ground within a wide 110.02-108.32 band against the Buck. The catalyst was renewed concern over the Chinese outbreak, as noted above, after confirmed cases reached more countries across the globe and hopes containing the contamination or finding a cure faster than previously envisaged faded.</p><p><strong>* GBP/CHF/EUR/CAD: </strong>All ending the week more narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, though still considerably weaker on balance as Cable totters just above post-UK election lows and the 1.2900 handle vs 1.3200+ at one stage, partly due to the Dollar’s overall dominance and the return of Brexit angst. On that note, PM Johnson underscored demands for terms of trade with the EU after the transition, but the Pound was really rattled when reports emerged about MiFID 2 targeting the City of London’s financial firms and France trying to poach Euro clearing with business incentives. Meanwhile, the Franc endured mixed fortunes with a hefty fall vs the Buck to 0.9770 from 0.9631 amidst dovish SNB commentary from President Jordan, but decent gains against the Euro around 1.0700 as the single currency was blighted by more worrying German/Eurozone data that hardly chimed with a more upbeat assessment from ECB’s Lagarde and the monthly bulletin, though both largely reflected the views emanating from January’s policy confab rather than subsequent data/surveys. Indeed, Eur/Usd tested 1.0950 compared to 1.1095 at the other extreme after breaching the 1.1000 level and a Fib at 1.0964. Last but not least, the Loonie had to endure mostly weak crude prices amidst all the China-related swings in market morale and only got a fleeting fillip between a 1.3319-1.3228 corridor after a stronger than anticipated rise in Canadian jobs that was embellished by the fact that full time jobs accounted for all and a bit more of the total count, but quickly offset by an equally big downward revision to the previous month.</p><p><strong>* SCANDI/EM: </strong>Pronounced depreciation on a bearish combination of bad macro releases, weakness in underlying commodities, unexpected Central Bank easing or dovish guidance after expected hikes and vice-versa on top of more specific/individual factors like geo and domestic politics, Government-state finances and bearish chart signals as key tech supports/levels gave way. For example, the Nok was undermined by Norwegian GDP, Mxn and Brl by benign CPI after the latter gleaned some support from the BCB flagging an end to its easing cycle. Conversely, the Thb was not anticipating the BoT to cut by the same 25 bp margin and the Sgd was caught out by dovish MAS rhetoric like the Rub following another ¼ point CBR rate reduction. Meanwhile, ongoing problems at SA’s Eskom appeared to be abating when the Government signalled its backing for COSATU proposals to sooth the utility’s financial and operational frailties, but the Zar only benefited briefly. Finally, the Cnh and Cny have tracked unfolding outbreak developments and news for the most part since the delayed return from China’s Lunar New Year break, but remain on the backfoot near the psychological 7.0000 level even though the PBoC and authorities have unleashed multiple initiatives to try and counter the adverse economic/market impact of the virus.</p>",

Participants are still awaiting an official announcement from OPEC+, as Russia’s Energy Minister Novak stated that more time is needed to assess the coronavirus situation and its impact on the oil market, noting next week the decision will be made for its position on the OPEC+ meeting due next month – the lack of decision is causing some anxiety among participants on whether a significant action will be taken. Elsewhere, Russia’s Energy Minister Novak stated that global oil demand may drop by 150-200k BPD in 2020 compared to 2019, due to uncertainties in Libya, Iran and Venezuela. Analysts at PVM highlighted that in the past Russia have resisted initially but eventually will change to be in line with OPEC and non-OPEC allies. PVM note the same is expected in this case, especially as Foreign Minister Lavrov expressed support for the proposed production cuts. Elsewhere, the latest Platts survey found OPEC crude output fall 470k BPD in January, where Libya production hit an 18 month low due to the ongoing blockades, whereas Iraq output rose after four months of improving compliance and total compliance for 10 members with quotas stood at 128%. This week’s Baker Hughes US rig count saw oil rigs +1 at 676, natural gas -1 at 111, leaving the total unchanged at 790.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Dollar reigns, as coronavirus spreads and risk sentiment sours",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Barring a major upset or change in the tide, the Greenback remains on course to extend its run of consecutive daily gains to a full trading week, with only a few interludes along the way and just a minor blip to digest the details of January’s jobs report. In sum, the payroll tally surpassed expectations and y/y average earnings were firmer than forecast in contrast to the m/m print and unemployment rate. Nevertheless, the data does not alter the narrative and after upbeat ISM surveys (in headline terms if not all sub-components) is highly unlikely to alter the near term Fed policy outlook in the run up to the semi-annual report and next week’s testimonies by chair Powell. Hence, the <strong>DXY </strong>remains elevated between 97.429-98.672 parameters, albeit off best levels as certain G10 currency counterparts stage a late comeback amidst ongoing Chinese nCoV, Brexit and geopolitical jitters.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to their US peer, the Aussie and Kiwi are both staring at hefty net declines and closes closer to the bottom of 0.6774-0.6663 and 0.6502-0.6404 respective ranges. Aud/Usd did receive some respite from the RBA earlier in the week when the OCR was maintained and GDP forecasts were only modestly tweaked, but the latest SOMP was less upbeat with 2020 growth downgraded on the base-line assumption that rates will be cut by another 25 bp. However, the real bugbear for the Aussie and Kiwi that gleaned little in the way of independent impetus from a rather mixed NZ employment release ahead of February’s RBNZ policy meeting next Wednesday was the mounting tally and widening spread of China’s coronavirus, with economic fallout by contagion or association.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Friday’s G10 outperformer as broad risk appetite waned and the Yen clawed back lost ground within a wide 110.02-108.32 band against the Buck. The catalyst was renewed concern over the Chinese outbreak, as noted above, after confirmed cases reached more countries across the globe and hopes containing the contamination or finding a cure faster than previously envisaged faded.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All ending the week more narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, though still considerably weaker on balance as Cable totters just above post-UK election lows and the 1.2900 handle vs 1.3200+ at one stage, partly due to the Dollar’s overall dominance and the return of Brexit angst. On that note, PM Johnson underscored demands for terms of trade with the EU after the transition, but the Pound was really rattled when reports emerged about MiFID 2 targeting the City of London’s financial firms and France trying to poach Euro clearing with business incentives. Meanwhile, the Franc endured mixed fortunes with a hefty fall vs the Buck to 0.9770 from 0.9631 amidst dovish SNB commentary from President Jordan, but decent gains against the Euro around 1.0700 as the single currency was blighted by more worrying German/Eurozone data that hardly chimed with a more upbeat assessment from ECB’s Lagarde and the monthly bulletin, though both largely reflected the views emanating from January’s policy confab rather than subsequent data/surveys. Indeed, Eur/Usd tested 1.0950 compared to 1.1095 at the other extreme after breaching the 1.1000 level and a Fib at 1.0964. Last but not least, the Loonie had to endure mostly weak crude prices amidst all the China-related swings in market morale and only got a fleeting fillip between a 1.3319-1.3228 corridor after a stronger than anticipated rise in Canadian jobs that was embellished by the fact that full time jobs accounted for all and a bit more of the total count, but quickly offset by an equally big downward revision to the previous month.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Pronounced depreciation on a bearish combination of bad macro releases, weakness in underlying commodities, unexpected Central Bank easing or dovish guidance after expected hikes and vice-versa on top of more specific/individual factors like geo and domestic politics, Government-state finances and bearish chart signals as key tech supports/levels gave way. For example, the Nok was undermined by Norwegian GDP, Mxn and Brl by benign CPI after the latter gleaned some support from the BCB flagging an end to its easing cycle. Conversely, the Thb was not anticipating the BoT to cut by the same 25 bp margin and the Sgd was caught out by dovish MAS rhetoric like the Rub following another ¼ point CBR rate reduction. Meanwhile, ongoing problems at SA’s Eskom appeared to be abating when the Government signalled its backing for COSATU proposals to sooth the utility’s financial and operational frailties, but the Zar only benefited briefly. Finally, the Cnh and Cny have tracked unfolding outbreak developments and news for the most part since the delayed return from China’s Lunar New Year break, but remain on the backfoot near the psychological 7.0000 level even though the PBoC and authorities have unleashed multiple initiatives to try and counter the adverse economic/market impact of the virus.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> declined amid the ongoing coronavirus fears and tentativeness ahead of the trade figures which are expected to show exports and imports slipped into contraction territory, although officials have remained supportive including the PBoC’s Beijing branch which directed banks to cap interest rates offered to key enterprises at 100bps below the Loan Prime Rate. Finally, 10yr JGBs benefitted from the risk averse tone which lifted prices back above the 152.50 level, while the BoJ were also present in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>China Customs Office says that they are to combine the months of January and February for reporting of trade data amid today's lack of prelim trade data</strong>.

APAC bouses ended the week on a mixed footing following a mostly subdued session – Mainland China eked mild gains after reports of supportive steps by the PBoC to cope with downward pressures arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Back to Europe, bourses are mostly subdued with no clear standouts. Sectors are largely in negative territory with defensives faring modestly better than cyclicals. In terms of individual movers, Credit Suisse (-2.5%) slipped to the foot of the SMI (~3% weighting) following the departure of CEO Thiam following the spying scandal. Thiam will be leaving his post on February 14th and is to be replaced by Thomas Gottstein, the current head of the bank’s Swiss business. Note: Credit Suisse will be reporting its results on February 13th.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Burberry’s (-1.3%) withdrawal of guidance and bleak demand outlook for the luxury market (amid the virus outbreak) has prompted sympathy play from European peers including Richemont (-1.3%), Swatch (-0.9%), LVMH (-1.0%) and Kering (-1.5%).

APAC bouses ended the week on a mixed footing following a mostly subdued session – Mainland China eked mild gains after reports of supportive steps by the PBoC to cope with downward pressures arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Back to Europe, bourses are mostly subdued with no clear standouts. Sectors are largely in negative territory with defensives faring modestly better than cyclicals.&nbsp; In terms of individual movers, Credit Suisse (-2.5%) slipped to the foot of the SMI (~3% weighting) following the departure of CEO Thiam following the spying scandal. Thiam will be leaving his post on February 14th and is to be replaced by Thomas Gottstein, the current head of the bank’s Swiss business. Note: Credit Suisse will be reporting its results on February 13th.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Burberry’s (-1.3%) withdrawal of guidance and bleak demand outlook for the luxury market (amid the virus outbreak) has prompted sympathy play from European peers including Richemont (-1.3%), Swatch (-0.9%), LVMH (-1.0%) and Kering (-1.5%).

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>It remains gradual and measured, but relatively resolute as the Greenback maintains positive momentum and on track to extend its winning streak amidst widespread if not universal gains vs currency rivals. Indeed, <strong>DXY </strong>pull-backs are becoming increasingly shallow and short-lived with the index now building a platform around 98.500 and just posting a fresh peak at 98.639 ahead of the next bullish chart resistance level at 98.885 (higher Fib retracement from 2019 peak to December trough). US jobs data may present a fundamental hurdle, but in the current constructive climate the bar appears high in terms of an upset to stall the Buck’s rally or halt the bull run altogether.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The clear G10 underperformers, as the Aussie recoils further from Tuesday’s post-RBA peaks and the Kiwi retreats partly in sympathy towards 0.6680 and 0.6400 respectively vs their US counterpart. Aud/Usd gleaned little if any traction via the SOMP or latest rhetoric from Governor Lowe as the former revealed lower GDP forecasts based on the assumption that rates will be reduced by another 25 bp. Moreover, news of a delay to Chinese trade data and the ongoing spread of the coronavirus are weighing on risk sentiment in general, as the <strong>YUAN </strong>slips back to 7.0000 against the US Dollar.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>Also unable to resist the Greenback’s advances, with the Euro also blighted by more dire German/Eurozone data and increasingly bearish technical impulses having fallen through a sub-1.1000 Fib (1.0964) and now testing the resolve of bids around 1.0950 ahead of last October’s pre-2019 full year low (1.0941).&nbsp; Similarly, the Loonie has lost grip of the 1.3300 handle, but could yet be saved from a worse fate and stops said to be poised on a break of 1.3320 by decent option expiry interest between 1.3290-1.3300, if not impending Canadian payrolls. Meanwhile, the Franc is still somewhat mixed given weakness vs the Buck below 0.97500 in contrast to strength through 1.0700 against the Euro.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP</strong></p><p>The Yen is paring losses amidst a partial reversal in risk-on flows and renewed safe-haven positioning, with Usd/Jpy back down to circa 109.70 from just above 110.00 even though media reports suggest official GPIF sponsored selling of the Japanese unit alongside PBoC OMOs. However, the Pound is also holding up fairly well in the circumstances, as Cable hovers above 1.2900 and the post-UK GE trough, and Eur/Gbp remains capped around 0.8500.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>Disappointing Norwegian data and another downturn in oil prices have combined to propel Eur/Nok above 10.1600 even though the single currency has its own negative factors to contend with, as noted above.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Broad depreciation on the aforementioned deterioration in risk appetite, or erosion, but the Rouble also ruing Brent’s retracement and the CBR’s dovish guidance following the latest 25 bp rate cut.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>US Treasury yields were little changed on Thursday, with the curve having a slightly steeper bias. Wires attributed Treasuries' performance to China's efforts to contain the coronavirus, and how it might be enough to prevent any deep economic fallout. And on that front, there were some interesting comments from Fed 2020 voter Kaplan, who has seemingly upgraded his view for US GDP growth this year, now seeing the economy expanding by 2.25%; in mid-January, Kaplan had seen growth around 2.0%, the median forecast on the FOMC. Attention now focuses on Friday's jobs data, with whisper numbers optimistic following this week's ADP beat; indeed, going into the data, US economic surprises are the highest since 2018, according to Citi's gauge. Desks have been suggesting that as virus fears ebb, traders may once again become more focussed on the fundamental backdrop, with data likely to be the swaying factor regarding the currently easy central bank policy (though the central bank will keep a cautious eye on global events, of course); on that note, the Fed will release its semi-annual report on Friday, ahead of Chair Powell's dual testimony to lawmakers next week.

ASX 200 (-0.4%) was dragged lower by weakness in energy and miners amid ongoing demand concerns triggered by the outbreak in China, while Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) was indecisive with focus in Tokyo on a deluge of earnings, weaker than expected Household Spending and reports of 41 additional coronavirus cases onboard the cruise ship off Yokohama, although it wasn’t all gloom and doom as SoftBank gapped higher by 8% after Elliot Management acquired a USD 2.5bln stake. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) declined amid the ongoing coronavirus fears and tentativeness ahead of the trade figures which are expected to show exports and imports slipped into contraction territory, although officials have remained supportive including the PBoC’s Beijing branch which directed banks to cap interest rates offered to key enterprises at 100bps below the Loan Prime Rate. Finally, 10yr JGBs benefitted from the risk averse tone which lifted prices back above the 152.50 level, while the BoJ were also present in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly subdued as the momentum from Wall St, where all major indices posted record levels and tech outperformed following Twitter earnings, was clouded by coronavirus fears and cautiousness heading into the latest Chinese trade data and US Non-Farm Payrolls. ASX 200 (-0.6%) was dragged lower by weakness in energy and miners amid ongoing demand concerns triggered by the outbreak in China, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) was indecisive with focus in Tokyo on a deluge of earnings and reports of 41 additional coronavirus cases onboard the cruise ship off Yokohama although it wasn’t all gloom and doom as SoftBank shares gapped higher by 8% after Elliot Management acquired a USD 2.5bln stake. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) are also downbeat amid the ongoing coronavirus fears and tentativeness ahead of the trade figures which are expected to show exports and imports slipped into contraction territory, although officials have remained supportive including the PBoC’s Beijing branch which directed banks to cap interest rates offered to key enterprises at 100bps below the Loan Prime Rate.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is uneventful and partially retraced the prior day’s gains after hitting resistance around 98.50 as participants await the key risk NFP jobs data due later, while its major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD and GBP/USD languishing below 1.1000 and 1.2950 respectively with little in the way of pertinent newsflow to spur price action or to suggest a shift in the uncompromising narrative for upcoming EU-UK trade negotiations. Elsewhere, USD/JPY has marginally pulled back due to the risk aversion and after a failed attempt at the 110.00 handle, while antipodeans are lacklustre due to their high beta characteristics and following the RBA Statement on Monetary Policy which noted they are discussing rate cuts but were also wary of the risks associated with lower rates. In addition, the central bank lowered its GDP growth outlook and its forecasts were also based on the technical assumption of a 25bps rate cut mid-year.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as the risk averse tone lifted prices back above the 152.50 level, while the BoJ are also present in the market for over JPY 1.1tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",
