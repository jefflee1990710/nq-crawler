The tone, however, was of caution in thin trading conditions, amid punchy rhetoric from US President Trump regarding China on late Thursday, as well as underwhelming earnings from AMZN and AAPL, which were in contrast to GOOG, FB, MSFT results earlier in the week. The ES and YM are looking to close out the week flat, though NQ is in the red, following what JPMorgan called early signs of a reflation trade; energy has bounced back this week, and the XLE is the best performing SPDR, followed by communications; on the other end of the scale, defensive utilities were the worst performer, followed by health care. On Friday, minvol baskets were relative outperformers, though has underperformed on the week; small cap baskets have seen decent gains in the week, as well as quality and value baskets, which all close the week in the green. In FX, risk-sensitive currencies have underperformed on Friday, and havens are higher, with XAU topping USD 1,700 briefly. The Treasury curve was little changed, though had a small bias towards flattening. On the data slate, the manufacturing ISM was better than feared in April, though was still grim, and the sub-components were equally grim. Next week, the non-manufacturing counterpart is on the slate for Monday; attention will also be on the jobs data towards the end of the week.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>CHINA</strong>: Overnight, US President Trump stated he has seen evidence the virus had originated from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, adding he cannot say why he has a high degree of certainty but noted the trade deal with China is now secondary to what China have done on the virus, adding he can respond with tariffs if necessary which dampened sentiment for the day. The statement followed with reports that Trump is exploring blocking government retiring savings fund Thrift Savings Plan from investing into Chinese equites deemed a national security risk. NEC Director Kudlow later followed up noting that China has “issues” that Trump will deal with, and that China will be held accountable for the coronavirus. However, he did not that the Phase One deal with China is moving along.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>FOMC members largely stuck to the script today. Kaplan (Voter) noted the US is likely to see a 20% jobless rate, but sees it ending the year at between 8-10%, adding US GDP might contract 30% in Q2, but by year end it is likely to be between 4.5-5.0%. He reiterated the Fed's line that rates will remain low for long, and the Fed will need to do more in this period (echoes Powell's comments from Wednesday). Fed’s Bullard (non-voter) also repeated guidance noting the Fed has made commitments to remain at low rates until the economy gets on a better footing. Believes the economy could recover in H2 providing the shock is temporary and believes inflation could be maintained not too far from the 2% target, thus avoiding a deflationary situation; note Powell stated as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, the economy will avoid disinflation. Fed’s Barkin (non-voter) stated the downturn is likely to last more than a couple of months, adding it is possible to return to normal operations but has to be done at a gradual pace. Barkin noted the aftermath of the crisis on both the labour force and productivity may be under pressure as some may choose to stay home while some may find difficulty in finding new work. Barkin expects a meaningful pick up in Q3, although the trajectory is dependent upon consumer confidence and health outcomes.</p><p><strong>BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada reported it was to appoint former Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem for the Governor job. In initial remarks, Macklem said there would be a seamless transition, which analysts say might suggest a continuation of the Bank’s current policy stance. Macklem also holds a similar view to Poloz, and on Friday noted that there were disruptive effects from negative interest rates, and that he was comfortable with rates at the lower bound of 0.25%. Macklem was Deputy Governor between 2010-2014 and is currently working in academia. Analysts at Canadian bank RBC highlight that he was the perceived front runner after Carney, although Poloz won the job instead. Macklem also was Associate Deputy Minister at the Department of Finance. He takes the reins at an unprecedent time, after the recent announcement of BOC stimulus measures under Poloz’s helm, which were designed to ensure market functionality rather than ‘traditional’ stimulus; although RBC believes that this shift will change as monetary policy shifts from crisis management to stimulus. Its analysts draw attention to two medium-term issues Macklem is faced with: an exit strategy from current stimulus, and Canada’s high debt loads; RBC writes “if indebtedness made withdrawing stimulus (including rates cuts to address the oil price shock) difficult in 2017-18, the challenge will be far greater during Macklem’s seven year tenure—even for a Governor that can rely on his experience with the Financial Stability Board.”</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 0.94 HIGHER AT USD 19.78/BBL; WTI (M0) SETTLES USD 0.44 HIGHER AT USD 22.29/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 0.04 LOWER AT USD 26.44/BBL</strong></p><p>Crude futures had an erratic end to the week, reversing earlier strength to settle little changed/mixed, relative to recent crude price swings that is. Tape action was likely influenced by positioning ahead of the weekend, where prices have settled higher on the week, likely causing some longs to close out their positions. Commenting on recent price strength, Citi notes that as social lockdown measures begin to loosen, it still only expects a “gradual transition” toward a tighter market, citing the supply glut as likely leading to elevated volumes at sea for some time to come. Some of the earlier upside in oil futures today had been attributed to an Argus Media report, citing the Algerian Energy Minister, who said the OPEC+ alliance is aiming \"to ensure a compliance rate of over 100%\" with its latest output cut agreement. However, sources late Thursday reported that Iraq could face difficulties to cut up to 1mln BPD, in line with OPEC+ deal, adding that it is still in talks with international oil companies for a deal to cut production. Elsewhere, amid several US oil majors reporting earnings today, Phillips 66 (PSX) said it was far from filling up on US refined products storage. Exxon (XOM) said it would be cutting rigs in the Permian basin by 75% by year-end. Lyondell Basel (LYB) said it is to operate most plants between 60-80% capacity in Q2, down from the current 85-90%. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs said it expects that inventory normalisation will be the first driver to flatten the Brent forward curve to around USD 30/bbl in Q3 20; said it expects oil demand to accelerate in upcoming weeks and for it to continue in May and June. The latest Baker Hughes US rig count (w/e May 1st): Oil -53 at 325, Nat Gas -4 at 81, Total -57 at 40.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 6 TICKS LOWER AT 138-28</strong></p><p>The TPLEX lacked direction on Friday amid light news flow and month-end passing. Rates had been heading lower overnight, with one desk noting passive month-end index-linked purchasing. However, as the US session got underway the gains were gradually reversed, despite wider risk off amid a cocktail of anti-China rhetoric and disappointing AMZN/AAPL earnings. A slightly better than expected headline ISM manufacturing managed provide some support to the risk tone, nudging T-Notes lower somewhat, although moves were very contained. On the supply front, corporate issuance cooled to end the week following the Boeing jumbo USD 25bln deal on Thursday, although investors may be cautious about bidding rates lower ahead of next week’s Treasury refunding announcement (May 6th), where the Treasury will explain how it plans to funds its ballooning deficit (it will likely launch the much touted 20-year Bond); furthermore, with corporates emerging from the other side of earnings, companies will be likely to flood the pipeline with debt offerings as many look to pay off short term credit facilities that have been maxed out amid the economy standstill. Elsewhere, the NY Fed announced it would be tapering its Treasury purchases to USD 8bln per day for next week from this week’s USD 10bln – note that the pace of the tapering has been declining in recent weeks, where last week it cut to USD 10bln from USD 15bln per day. By settlement, yields were little changed, 2s +1bps at 0.20%, 10s +1bps at 0.63%, and 30s unchanged at 1.27%.</p><p><strong>NY FED TREASURY/TIPS PURCHASES CHANGES BY BUCKET SIZE:</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-2.25 year: USD 13bln (prev.

AAPL increased its share repurchase programme by USD 50bln and increased its quarterly dividend to USD 0.82/shr (prev. 0.77/shr). Amazon (AMZN) missed on EPS, beat on revenue while its AWS and Subscription Service revenue missed expectations slightly, while it announced it expects to spend the entire operating profit in Q2 (USD 4bln) on COVID related expenses. Exxon (XOM) missed on EPS but beat on revenue. Production was firmer than expected while it cut FY20 CapEx view to USD 23bln from USD 33bln, although this is firmer than the expected USD 19.5bln. Chevron (CVX) beat on EPS and revenue but further reduced its FY CapEx guidance to as low as USD 14bln, although this was above analyst expectations. It noted it is taking action to protect its dividend and sustain long term value; Q1 production was softer than expected. Visa (V) beat on EPS and revenue and expects the acquisition of Plaid to be closed by the end of the year. Payments volume rose 5%, while data processing revenue rose 11% to USD 2.7bln, slightly short of the USD 2.78bln expected. AbbVie (ABBV) beat on EPS and revenue and expects to close the merger with Allergan (AGN) in May; sales of Humira beat estimates, while Imbruvica sales were in line. Q2 guidance was however light, but it reaffirmed its FY20 Adj. EPS forecast. Gilead (GILD) beat on top and bottom line, adding it expects to manufacture over 140k remdesivir treatment courses by the end of May and over 1mln by year-end. The stock was hit however as the CEO highlighted there is significant uncertainty regarding the overall impact to the business despite the stock being seen as a COVID winner thanks to remdesivir. Clorox (CLX) were higher after EPS and revenue beats while also providing strong guidance. United Airlines (UAL) beat on EPS but missed on revenue.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) announced it has reduced the cost of its China-made Model 3 by 10% to qualify for subsidies. During hours CEO Musk Tweeted in his opinion that the stock is currently too high, although it was initially unclear whether or not he was hacked as the post was followed with a string of peculiar tweets afterwards. WSJ later reported it was not a joke. Boeing Company (BA) announced it had completed a successful first flight of its second 777x jet. Walmart (WMT) confirmed it is planning to launch a 2-hour grocery delivery service names “Express”. Wells Fargo (WFC) is reportedly no longer accept applications for home equity lines of credit as of April 30th, 2020. Zoom Video (ZM) CEO is reportedly subject of a probe from the Education Department where it is investigating the University of Texas for possibly fault financial disclosures and is seeking any dealings with Huawei, Zoom CEO and the Chinese lab being probed as a potential virus source, according to WSJ citing sources.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US ISM MANUFACTURING (APR): </strong>The headline fell to 41.5 from 49.1, better than the expected 36.9. The report noted that a reading above 42.8, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy GDP is generally expanding; below 42.8, it is generally declining. However, it is worth noting the headline is once again being supported by the Supplier Deliveries Index, which registered 76, up 11 points from the March reading, limiting the decrease in the headline. The rise in Suppliers Deliveries Index were due to the disruptions in domestic and global supply chains, driven primarily by supplier plant shutdowns. Meanwhile, other sub-indices were bleak: New Orders tumbled to 27.1 from 42.2, while employment fell to 27.5, much deeper than the expected fall to 37 from 49.1 and the lowest since 1949, boding poorly for next week’s jobs report (click here for preview).&nbsp; Production also tumbled to 27.5, a record low. Capital Economics were expecting the internals to be even worse as it thought the economic hit of COVID would be harder than the great financial crisis, and said the data was better regional surveys implied. CapEco said the data was consistent with GDP growth declining 5% annualised pace, but it believes the surveys are not showing the true scale of the downturn. However, it concludes “the fact that the surveys have not fallen further may be some tentative good news that manufacturing hasn’t completely collapsed while most of the services sector entered an extended hibernation.”</p><h2>WEEKLY FOREX WRAP</h2><p><strong>DOLLAR STAGGERS ACROSS MONTH END AND INTO MAY</strong></p><p><strong>USD: </strong>Some pundits will point to technical or psychological factors given that the DXY never looked comfortable above 100.000 and ultimately failed to retain grasp of the symbolic level, but in truth the Greenback was almost destined to finish April weaker due to the usual end of month rebalancing trend that gathered momentum alongside strong signals from bank models before reaching a crescendo late in the European session on Thursday. However, the Buck remains under pressure on Labour Day following a raft of more weak data and surveys underscoring a decidedly dour appraisal of the current situation and even bleaker assessment of what lies ahead from Fed Chair Powell after the FOMC and prior to further enhancements to the Main Street loan facility via an expansion of the scope and eligibility. Last, but not least, US President Trump raised the spectre of tariffs again when launching a more aggressive and accusatory volley at China based on evidence that the source of COVID-19 was Wuhan’s Institute of Virology, and this also appeared to undermine the Dollar, albeit not as much as broad risk sentiment and currencies more sensitive to bouts of aversion.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK: </strong>All on course to end Friday’s EU session near the bottom of the G10 pile, and also significantly closer to their lows for the week as a whole in the case of the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie. The Antipodeans had more poor economic indicators to deal with, bar firmer than forecast CPI and a record rise in exports respectively, but the real independent or rather collective weights came from Westpac (aside from general risk-off flows and commodity/oil price declines) via bearish views for the Aud and Nzd based on ‘brutal’ earnings and data points in the next few weeks, while the bank also raised eyebrows with an extremely dovish NIRP RBNZ call (-0.5% by November). Similar, dire data story for the Cad, but closer correlation to crude and not much initial reaction to news that Macklem will replace Poloz as new BoC Governor as the former mentioned negative rates as an option before the caveat that he content with the 0.25% lower bound. Conversely, a bad start to the new month does not mask a positive week overall for the Scandinavian Crowns as the Sek gleaned traction from the Riksbank’s hawkish hold, no additional QE and an unchanged repo path to 2021 and the Nok got more assistance from the Norges Bank’s upward tweak to May daily purchases vs last month and relative stability in oil after another spill on Monday.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/GBP: </strong>Somewhat contrasting fortunes for the Franc, Euro, Yen and Pound, as the former appreciated vs the Greenback, but unwound outperformance against the single currency, with the cross finally seeming to take some notice of the incessant rise in Swiss bank sight deposits that signal the extent of official efforts to curb excessive Chf strength/safe-haven demand. However, the single currency rallied in its own right, and especially vs the Buck between 1.0810-1.1017 or so extremes, at the expense of the Usd and not due to anything ECB-related. To recap, all benchmark rates were maintained, as were normal QE, envelope and PEPP totals, but TLTRO3 terms were sweetened further and new liquidity lines were provided via PELTROs. Elsewhere, the BoJ removed its JGB buying caps and increased corporate and commercial bond remits, but in line with pre-meeting sourced reports. Hence, no real or material Jpy reaction that decoupled from conventional inverse risk moves to track the Dollar and chart levels instead. Technical vibes were also influential for Sterling, with some intermittent UK specific impulses in the form of coronavirus developments and Brexit trade talks, but Cable benefited from seasonal and month end buying before pulling up short of the mid-April high and 200 DMA, while Eur/Gbp was very volatile within a 0.8672-0.8787 range and particularly either side of the falling 200 DMA<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>EM: </strong>A generally bad week for regional currencies was compounded by risk aversion on Friday, but the Yuan also had heightened US-China angst over the global pandemic to contend with, the Rand a deeper SA ratings cut into junk territory by S&amp;P and the Lira finally succumbed to a concerted break below 7.0000 following the CBRT lowering its end year inflation forecast. Meanwhile, Brazil’s political situation turned even more unstable with the resignation of the Justice Minister and Supreme Court’s suspension of his nomination for new Federal Police Chief, and Mexico’s nCov economic contagion was highlighted by abject GDP after all too brief respite from better than expected jobless rates in advance.</p>",

Rates had been heading lower overnight, with one desk noting passive month-end index-linked purchasing. However, as the US session got underway the gains were gradually reversed, despite wider risk off amid a cocktail of anti-China rhetoric and disappointing AMZN/AAPL earnings. A slightly better than expected headline ISM manufacturing managed provide some support to the risk tone, nudging T-Notes lower somewhat, although moves were very contained. On the supply front, corporate issuance cooled to end the week following the Boeing jumbo USD 25bln deal on Thursday, although investors may be cautious about bidding rates lower ahead of next week’s Treasury refunding announcement (May 6th), where the Treasury will explain how it plans to funds its ballooning deficit (it will likely launch the much touted 20-year Bond); furthermore, with corporates emerging from the other side of earnings, companies will be likely to flood the pipeline with debt offerings as many look to pay off short term credit facilities that have been maxed out amid the economy standstill. Elsewhere, the NY Fed announced it would be tapering its Treasury purchases to USD 8bln per day for next week from this week’s USD 10bln – note that the pace of the tapering has been declining in recent weeks, where last week it cut to USD 10bln from USD 15bln per day. By settlement, yields were little changed, 2s +1bps at 0.20%, 10s +1bps at 0.63%, and 30s unchanged at 1.27%.</p><p><strong>NY FED TREASURY/TIPS PURCHASES CHANGES BY BUCKET SIZE:</strong></p><ul><li>0-2.25 year: USD 13bln (prev.

Tape action was likely influenced by positioning ahead of the weekend, where prices have settled higher on the week, likely causing some longs to close out their positions. Commenting on recent price strength, Citi notes that as social lockdown measures begin to loosen, it still only expects a “gradual transition” toward a tighter market, citing the supply glut as likely leading to elevated volumes at sea for some time to come. Some of the earlier upside in oil futures today had been attributed to an Argus Media report, citing the Algerian Energy Minister, who said the OPEC+ alliance is aiming \"to ensure a compliance rate of over 100%\" with its latest output cut agreement. However, sources late Thursday reported that Iraq could face difficulties to cut up to 1mln BPD, in line with OPEC+ deal, adding that it is still in talks with international oil companies for a deal to cut production. Elsewhere, amid several US oil majors reporting earnings today, Phillips 66 (PSX) said it was far from filling up on US refined products storage. Exxon (XOM) said it would be cutting rigs in the Permian basin by 75% by year-end. Lyondell Basel (LYB) said it is to operate most plants between 60-80% capacity in Q2, down from the current 85-90%. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs said it expects that inventory normalization will be the first driver to flatten the Brent forward curve to around USD 30/bbl in Q3 20; said it expects oil demand to accelerate in upcoming weeks and for it to continue in May and June. The latest Baker Hughes US rig count (w/e May 1st): Oil -53 at 325, Nat Gas -4 at 81, Total -57 at 40.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>BOC: The Bank of Canada reported it was to appoint former Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem for the Governor job. In initial remarks, Macklem said there would be a seamless transition, which analysts say might suggest a continuation of the Bank’s current policy stance. Macklem also holds a similar view to Poloz, and on Friday noted that there were disruptive effects from negative interest rates, and that he was comfortable with rates at the lower bound of 0.25%. Macklem was Deputy Governor between 2010-2014, and is currently working in academia. Analysts at Canadian bank RBC highlight that he was the perceived front runner after Carney, although Poloz won the job instead. Macklem also was Associate Deputy Minister at the Department of Finance. He takes the reins at an unprecedent time, after the recent announcement of BOC stimulus measures under Poloz’s helm, which were designed to ensure market functionality rather than ‘traditional’ stimulus; although RBC believes that this shift will change as monetary policy shifts from crisis management to stimulus. Its analysts draw attention to two medium-term issues Macklem is faced with: an exit strategy from current stimulus, and Canada’s high debt loads; RBC writes “if indebtedness made withdrawing stimulus (including rates cuts to address the oil price shock) difficult in 2017-18, the challenge will be far greater during Macklem’s seven year tenure—even for a Governor that can rely on his experience with the Financial Stability Board.”</p>",

The report noted that a reading above 42.8, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy GDP is generally expanding; below 42.8, it is generally declining. However, it is worth noting the headline is once again being supported by the Supplier Deliveries Index, which registered 76, up 11 points from the March reading, limiting the decrease in the headline. The rise in Suppliers Deliveries Index were due to the disruptions in domestic and global supply chains, driven primarily by supplier plant shutdowns. Meanwhile, other sub indices were bleak: New Orders tumbled to 27.1 from 42.2, while employment fell to 27.5, much deeper than the expected fall to 37 from 49.1 and the lowest since 1949, boding poorly for next week’s jobs report (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24425/download\">click here for preview</a>).&nbsp; Production also tumbled to 27.5, a record low. Capital Economics were expecting the internals to be even worse as it thought the economic hit of COVID would be harder than the great financial crisis, and said the data was better regional surveys implied. CapEco said the data was consistent with GDP growth declining 5% annualised pace, but it believes the surveys are not showing the true scale of the downturn. However, it concludes “the fact that the surveys have not fallen further may be some tentative good news that manufacturing hasn’t completely collapsed while most of the services sector entered an extended hibernation.”</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Dollar staggers across month end and into May",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Some pundits will point to technical or psychological factors given that the <strong>DXY </strong>never looked comfortable above 100.000 and ultimately failed to retain grasp of the symbolic level, but in truth the Greenback was almost destined to finish April weaker due to the usual end of month rebalancing trend that gathered momentum alongside strong signals from bank models before reaching a crescendo late in the European session on Thursday. However, the Buck remains under pressure on Labour Day following a raft of more weak data and surveys underscoring a decidedly dour appraisal of the current situation and even bleaker assessment of what lies ahead from Fed Chair Powell after the FOMC and prior to further enhancements to the Main Street loan facility via an expansion of the scope and eligibility. Last, but not least, US President Trump raised the spectre of tariffs again when launching a more aggressive and accusatory volley at China based on evidence that the source of COVID-19 was Wuhan’s Institute of Virology, and this also appeared to undermine the Dollar, albeit not as much as broad risk sentiment and currencies more sensitive to bouts of aversion.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on course to end Friday’s EU session near the bottom of the G10 pile, and also significantly closer to their lows for the week as a whole in the case of the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie. The Antipodeans had more poor economic indicators to deal with, bar firmer than forecast CPI and a record rise in exports respectively, but the real independent or rather collective weights came from Westpac (aside from general risk-off flows and commodity/oil price declines) via bearish views for the Aud and Nzd based on ‘brutal’ earnings and data points in the next few weeks, while the bank also raised eyebrows with an extremely dovish NIRP RBNZ call (-0.5% by November). Similar, dire data story for the Cad, but closer correlation to crude and not much initial reaction to news that Macklem will replace Poloz as new BoC Governor as the former mentioned negative rates as an option before the caveat that he content with the 0.25% lower bound. Conversely, a bad start to the new month does not mask a positive week overall for the Scandinavian Crowns as the Sek gleaned traction from the Riksbank’s hawkish hold, no additional QE and an unchanged repo path to 2021 and the Nok got more assistance from the Norges Bank’s upward tweak to May daily purchases vs last month and relative stability in oil after another spill on Monday.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/GBP</strong></p><p>Somewhat contrasting fortunes for the Franc, Euro, Yen and Pound, as the former appreciated vs the Greenback, but unwound outperformance against the single currency, with the cross finally seeming to take some notice of the incessant rise in Swiss bank sight deposits that signal the extent of official efforts to curb excessive Chf strength/safe-haven demand. However, the single currency rallied in its own right, and especially vs the Buck between 1.0810-1.1017 or so extremes, at the expense of the Usd and not due to anything ECB-related. To recap, all benchmark rates were maintained, as were normal QE, envelope and PEPP totals, but TLTRO3 terms were sweetened further and new liquidity lines were provided via PELTROs. Elsewhere, the BoJ removed its JGB buying caps and increased corporate and commercial bond remits, but in line with pre-meeting sourced reports. Hence, no real or material Jpy reaction that decoupled from conventional inverse risk moves to track the Dollar and chart levels instead. Technical vibes were also influential for Sterling, with some intermittent UK specific impulses in the form of coronavirus developments and Brexit trade talks, but Cable benefited from seasonal and month end buying before pulling up short of the mid-April high and 200 DMA, while Eur/Gbp was very volatile within a 0.8672-0.8787 range and particularly either side of the falling 200 DMA.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A generally bad week for regional currencies was compounded by risk aversion on Friday, but the Yuan also had heightened US-China angst over the global pandemic to contend with, the Rand a deeper SA ratings cut into junk territory by S&amp;P and the Lira finally succumbed to a concerted break below 7.0000 following the CBRT lowering its end year inflation forecast. Meanwhile, Brazil’s political situation turned even more unstable with the resignation of the Justice Minister and Supreme Court’s suspension of his nomination for new Federal Police Chief, and Mexico’s nCov economic contagion was highlighted by abject GDP after all too brief respite from better than expected jobless rates in advance.</p>",

        "subject": "US EQUITY OPEN: Indices in negative territory as Trump undermines sentiment after comments suggesting he can retaliate against China with tariffs if needed",
        "content": "<p><strong>SNAPSHOT:</strong> A quiet end to the week, with many players away for May Day... The risk tone is defensive after US President Trump reignited tensions with China, seemingly relegating trade talks with the nation. In terms of earnings, both AAPL and AMZN open red following earnings after market close on Thursday (AAPL -1%, AMZN -5.7%), desks suggest that investor jitters around AAPL were due to the lack of formal guidance (first time in a decade), news which offset its boosting of share buybacks and dividend raise, while its iPhone/iPad/Mac revenues also fell short. Note, AAPL are off pre-market lows. And for AMZN, there seems to be a debate running about some of its items that it views as “investments”, which the Street classifies as expenses. Ahead, ISM manufacturing data will be grim, possibly a series low (preview below)</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>All sectors open in negative territory after US President Trump suggested he could retaliate against China over COVID with tariffs if needed, noting trade is secondary to what China did regarding the coronavirus. Consumer Discretionary leads the losses, down almost 3%, as Amazon (AMZN) is under pressure after earnings. On the flipside, Consumer Staples are relatively ‘outperforming’ amid solid earnings from Clorox (CLX) and Estee Lauder (EL), though remain negative.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) beat on EPS and revenue, although iPhone/iPad/Mac revenue missed expectations. AAPL increased its share repurchase programme by USD 50bln and increased its quarterly dividend to USD 0.82/shr (prev. 0.77/shr). Amazon (AMZN) missed on EPS, beat on revenue while its AWS and Subscription Service revenue missed expectations slightly, while it announced it expects to spend the entire operation profit in Q2 (USD 4bln) on COVID related expenses. Exxon (XOM) missed on EPS but beat on revenue. Production was firmer than expected while it cut FY20 CapEx view to USD 23bln from USD 33bln, although this is firmer than the expected USD 19.5bln. Chevron (CVX) beat on EPS and revenue but further reduced its FY CapEx guidance to as low as USD 14bln, although this was above analyst expectations. It noted it is taking action to protect its dividend and sustain long term value; Q1 production was softer than expected. Visa (V) beat on EPS and revenue and expects the acquisition of Plaid to be closed by the end of the year. Payments volume rose 5%, while data processing revenue rose 11% to USD 2.7bln, slightly short of the USD 2.78bln expected. AbbVie (ABBV) beat on EPS and revenue and expects to close the merger with Allergan (AGN) in May; sales of Humira beat estimates, while Imbruvica sales were in line. Q2 guidance was however light, but it reaffirmed its FY20 Adj. EPS forecast.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) announced it has reduced the cost of its China-made Model 3 by 10% to qualify for subsidies. Boeing Company (BA) announced it had completed a successful first flight of its second 777x jet. Walmart (WMT) confirmed it is planning to launch a 2-hour grocery delivery service names “Express”. Wells Fargo (WFC) is reportedly no longer accept applications for home equity lines of credit as of April 30th, 2020. Zoom Video (ZM) CEO is reportedly subject of a probe from the Education Department where it is investigating the University of Texas for possibly fault financial disclosures and is seeking any dealings with Huawei, Zoom CEO and the Chinese lab being probed as a potential virus source, according to WSJ citing sources.</p><p><strong>CREDIT &amp; EQUITIES:</strong> Since the Fed dropped its alphabet soup towards the latter end of March, credit spreads, particularly IG and to a lesser degree HY, have steadily been narrowing towards their pre-crisis level, at a spectacular pace relative to previous recoveries. However, in the equity complex, the retracement has been defensive in nature, led by momentum/growth large caps such as FAANG stocks while values and cyclicals have been hit heavy. However, this week marked somewhat of a reversal – many draw attention to the outperformance of the SPX equal-weighted vs the market-cap-weighted - showing some signs of a reflation trade; JPMorgan highlights the weekly winners, “Commodities (notably Oil +18% this week), EM Currencies (+2%) and Small Cap Equities (+10%); and at the sector level, Energy and Metals &amp; Mining stocks (+11%).” The missing component of a continuation of a typical reflation trade, says JPMorgan, is a rise in DM bond yields and inflation expectations, although the bank warns that investors should become accustomed to a long-term decoupling of the two compared to the wider equity/credit spectrum, citing acute central bank intervention and ballooning unemployment rates.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS: </strong>UBS argues that now is the time to start looking at Cyclicals stocks, suggesting interest rates have argued for risks/cyclicality to trough in Q2 this year. UBS observes that there is usually a sustainable equity recovery after a trough, which tends to see a rotation towards cyclicals and away from defensives. UBS points out outperformance in Value and High-Beta stocks over recent days, adding it may be possible that cyclicality will still rebound from here due to the ongoing stimulus measures despite the uncertainty. “In any case, given the stimulus in the pipeline, when Cyclicals do rebound sustainably, they should have an extended window of outperformance”, UBS notes.</p><p><strong>ISM MANUFACTURING:</strong> The Street looks for the manufacturing ISM survey to fall to 36.9 in April (range: 30.0 to 48.7) from 49.1 in March, as the nationwide shutdowns hit activity in April. Some desks are looking for an even deeper fall, possibly printing a low for the series not seen in decades (NOTE: the low in 2008 was 34.5, and in 1980 a low of 29.4 was printed). Naturally, this all highlights how the margin for error will be quite wide, with regards to expectations. Full preview here.</p><p><strong>RENEWED CHINA TENSIONS: </strong>In additional macro headwind, US President Trump is ratcheting up pressure on China again, and said that the China trade deal was now secondary to what China did regarding the virus, where he claims to have seen evidence that the virus had originated from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, and the President suggested that tariffs could be an appropriate response to China. While this may be pre-election campaigning, USDCNH has spiked higher. The question for traders is whether this is just pre-election rhetoric, or whether Trump will follow through with tariffs and, indeed, put trade negotiations on the back burner.</p>",

Indeed, the DXY is tethered to 99.000, albeit with a softer bias on balance and only just holding above chart support near 98.800, as the Yen, Franc and Euro remain bid vs building pressure on the likes of the Aussie, Kiwi, Sterling, Loonie and Scandi Kronas.

        "subject": "US PRE-MARKET MACRO: Bourses lower amid AAPL & AMZN disappointments and Trump's anti-China rhetoric ",
        "content": "<p><strong>SNAPSHOT:</strong> A quiet end to the week, with many players away for May Day... The risk tone is defensive after US President Trump reignited tensions with China, seemingly relegating trade talks with the nation. In terms of earnings, both AAPL and AMZN are red in pre-market action following earnings after market close on Thursday (AAPL -2.5%, AMZN -5.2%), and that is seeing NQ futures underperform the ES (-64pts) and YM (-500pts); desks suggest that investor jitters around AAPL were due to the lack of formal guidance (first time in a decade), news which offset its boosting of share buybacks and dividend raise, while its iPhone/iPad/Mac revenues also fell short. And for AMZN, there seems to be a debate running about some of its items that it views as “investments”, which the Street classifies as expenses. Ahead, ISM manufacturing data will be grim, possibly a series low (preview below).</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>XOM is due shortly at 0730 ET, coming after CVX that just reported. CVX beat on top and bottom lines, but also cut its FY capex (to “as low as” USD 14bln, not as low as the Street had expected), although it maintained its dividend, a tail risk for US oil majors after Shell took the step to cut its yesterday. Elsewhere, V reported, painting a similar picture to MA on the spending outlook, a decline at March-end which has since recovered somewhat, albeit still lower Y/Y. GILD figures were ok, while it continued to give colour on remdesivir, where it expects it could provide 100k treatments worth by May-end. For semiconductors, WDC had a decent top line, driven by Data Centre (as is the case for the wider sector this Q), while EPS came in light, furthermore, the dividend was suspended in somewhat of a surprise to the sector which has otherwise been holding up well for now.</p><p><strong>RENEWED CHINA TENSIONS:</strong> In additional macro headwind, US President Trump is ratcheting up pressure on China again, and said that the China trade deal was now secondary to what China did regarding the virus, where he claims to have seen evidence that the virus had originated from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, and the President suggested that tariffs could be an appropriate response to China. While this may be pre-election campaigning, USDCNH has spiked higher. The question for traders is whether this is just pre-election rhetoric, or whether Trump will follow through with tariffs and, indeed, put trade negotiations on the back burner.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ISM MANUFACTURING:</strong> The Street looks for the manufacturing ISM survey to fall to 36.9 in April (range: 30.0 to 48.7) from 49.1 in March, as the nationwide shutdowns hit activity in April. Some desks are looking for an even deeper fall, possibly printing a low for the series not seen in decades (NOTE: the low in 2008 was 34.5, and in 1980 a low of 29.4 was printed). Naturally, this all highlights how the margin for error will be quite wide, with regards to expectations. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-april-ism-manufacturing-survey-due-1000-et-1500-bst-the-survey-will-fully-reflect-the-covid-fallout-and-is-expected-to-drop-sharply-01-05-2020\">Full preview here.</a></p><p><strong>CREDIT &amp; EQUITIES:</strong> Since the Fed dropped its alphabet soup towards the latter end of March, credit spreads, particularly IG and to a lesser degree HY, have steadily been narrowing towards their pre-crisis level, at a spectacular pace relative to previous recoveries. However, in the equity complex, the retracement has been defensive in nature, led by momentum/growth large caps such as FAANG stocks while values and cyclicals have been hit heavy. However, this week marked somewhat of a reversal – many draw attention to the outperformance of the SPX equal-weighted vs the market-cap-weighted - showing some signs of a reflation trade; JPMorgan highlights the weekly winners, “Commodities (notably Oil +18% this week), EM Currencies (+2%) and Small Cap Equities (+10%); and at the sector level, Energy and Metals &amp; Mining stocks (+11%).” The missing component of a continuation of a typical reflation trade, says JPMorgan, is a rise in DM bond yields and inflation expectations, although the bank warns that investors should become accustomed to a long-term decoupling of the two compared to the wider equity/credit spectrum, citing acute central bank intervention and ballooning unemployment rates.</p>",

Amazon shares declined around 5% in extended trade after mixed results in which the Co. missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts and noted it expects to spend its entire USD 4bln of operating profit on COVID-related expenses, while Apple initially gained after it beat on top and bottom lines, boosted its share buyback by USD 50bln and raised its dividend, although the gains were only brief as the results were clouded by weaker than expected iPhone and iPad sales and after the tech giant refrained from providing a Q3 outlook. <strong>ASX 200 (-5.1%)</strong> was the laggard with downside led by heavy losses in the commodity related sectors and a slump in the top-weighted financials with selling exacerbated by profit taking after the index had rallied to its highest level in 6 weeks and notched its best month on record for April. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.8%)</strong> also suffered firm losses amid a slew of earnings and after Tokyo Core CPI data turned negative to trigger fears of a return to deflation, while reports also noted that PM Abe is to formally decide to extend the state of emergency due to coronavirus on Monday. As a reminder, markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were shut alongside most of the regional bourses, although China’s tensions with US remained in the spotlight after comments from US President who suggested he has seen evidence the virus had originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and that he can do tariffs to respond to China, with sources also later noting the US is considering blocking government retirement savings funds from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid spillover selling from T-notes which had reversed intraday gains and briefly fell below 139.00 amid heavy supply including Boeing’s USD 25bln 7-tranche offering, while JGB prices were also hampered by weaker demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr, 5yr, 10yr &amp; 20yr JGBs.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said the China trade deal is now secondary to what China did regarding the virus and that he has seen evidence the virus had originated from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China</strong>, while he stated that he cannot say why he has a high degree the virus originated there but <strong>suggested he can do tariffs to respond to China.</strong> Furthermore, reports later noted that President Trump is exploring blocking government retirement savings fund Thrift Savings Plan, from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk. (Newswires)</p><p>BoJ minutes from March meeting stated that Japan's economic activity had been weak recently due mainly to the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 and was likely to remain so for the time being mainly affected by the outbreak of the disease. Members concurred that the outlook for prices was likely to be somewhat weak for the time being, partly due to the effects of the decline in crude oil prices, while several board members said consumer and household sentiment could sour rapidly if markets remain unstable. Furthermore, members concurred that financial conditions in Japan were accommodative on the whole but had become less so and a few members said it was uncertain whether the economy can make a strong rebound once virus was contained.

Sentiment remains on the backfoot, Nasdaq and Dow futures relinquished the 8800 and 24000 levels respectively before extending losses, as markets price in an escalation in US-Sino tensions after US President Trump threatened tariffs, whilst negatively perceived earnings from Apple (-3% pre-mkt) and Amazon (-4.5% pre-mkt) add further pressure to US equity futures. Apple beat on top and bottom line, but iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales fell short of forecasts. Amazon missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts, albeit subscription services disappointed and the group expects to spend the entire USD 4bln of operating profit on virus-related expenses. Back to London, FTSE 100 sees most of its stocks in the red, with heavyweight Shell (-6%) continuing to be weighed on by its dividend cut alongside a broker downgrade and the pullback in the energy complex, BP (-4%) moves lower in tandem. Large-cap miners also reside towards the foot of the UK index as base metals take a hit from sentiment amid the prospect of escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies: with Rio Tinto -3.7%, Glencore -5.3%, BHP -4%. On the flip side, RBS (+3.4%) is among one of the few gainers post-earnings after topping earnings and operating profit forecasts and despite Q1 impairments rising almost ten-fold YY to GBP 802mln from GBP 88mln.</p><p><strong>Apple (AAPL) - </strong>Q2 2020 (USD): EPS 2.55 (exp. 2.26); Revenue 58.3bln (exp. 54.54bln).

China \"saw a nice improvement in March and a further improvement in April\". Co says overall sales have seen a better second half of April than they did in the last part of March and beginning of April.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN) - </strong>Q1 2020 (USD): EPS 5.01 (exp. 6.25/6.18 reported), revenue 75.5bln (exp. 73.61bln).

(Newswires) Co. shares fell 0.75% after-market.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>Little respite for the Dollar in holiday-thinned volumes at the start of the new month due to Labour Day, but the DXY is clinging to or at least staying within sight of 99.000 by virtue of even more weakness in rival currencies amidst broad risk-off sentiment following US President Trump’s latest accusatory comments regarding COVID-19 and threat of reprisals against China, including more trade tariffs.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Not the biggest G10 mover by a long chalk, but volatile given that the UK is one of the only European centres open on May 1st. Moreover, some payback after hefty month end gains has ensued, with Cable backing off further from 1.2600+ highs after failing to sustain momentum to test mid-April peaks and a key technical level in the form of the 200 DMA (1.2648 and 1.2654 respectively). Meanwhile, the Pound is also unwinding more upside vs the Euro as the cross rebounds further from sub-0.8700 levels towards 0.8750 and back above the 200 DMA yet again (now around 0.8722) on the usual RHS for fixing dynamic. For the record, an even weaker than prelim manufacturing PMI, collapse in consumer credit and miss in mortgage approvals were all largely brushed aside, along with significantly stronger than forecast Nationwide house prices.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK - </strong>The major laggards, and in the case of the Aussie and Kiwi also the notable underperformers as overall aversion is compounded by a bearish research note from Westpac overnight. In short, the bank based its bleak outlook for the Antipodeans on prospects of ‘brutal’ earnings and data in coming weeks, and on that note AIG manufacturing PMI plunged deep below 50, while ANZ consumer confidence dropped to sub-100. Aud/Usd has duly retreated from 0.6500+ to under 0.6450 and Nzd/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6100 handle with Aud/Nzd pivoting 1.0600. Elsewhere, the Loonie has detached further from its close crude correlation, albeit with oil prices recoiling this is also keeping Usd/Cad afloat near 1.4050 vs 1.3850 at one stage on Thursday, pending the possible appointment of a new BoC Governor later today and Canada’s manufacturing PMI. Similarly, the Scandinavian Crowns have been scuppered by the downturn in crude and risk appetite, with Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek both nudging the tops of ranges near 11.3300 and 10.7500 respectively.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR - </strong>All benefiting from the aforementioned ongoing Buck weakness, as the Yen bounces from circa 107.40, Franc eyes 0.9600 and Euro grinds closer to 1.1000 having breached the 55 DMA (1.0949) and yesterday’s best (1.0972) to expose resistance at 1.0991 before the 200 DMA (1.1035).</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The ramp up in US vs China vitriol over the coronavirus has obviously taken its toll on the Yuan, as Usd/Cnh extends beyond 7.1300, but the contagion is spreading through the region like the global pandemic itself with Usd/Try up around 7.0400, Usd/Rub back over 75.0000 to name and highlight just a few.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> got a bit more impetus and brave in wake of broadly weak domestic releases at 9.30BST to fractionally extend intraday highs to 137.86, but stopped just 2 ticks short of Thursday’s Liffe session peak before drifting all the way back down and just posting a fresh base at 137.60 vs the 137.70 prior settlement level. Hence, consolidation rather than clear conviction one way or the other has panned out in the absence of other European, and especially core Eurozone equivalents to provide outside impetus or guidance via distraction. Moreover, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> have hardly stepped in to fill the void, with trade extremely subdued and volumes light due to Labour Day, awaiting the final Markit PMI, manufacturing ISM and construction spending to a lesser degree.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> futures gave up earlier mild gains as the positive sentiment seen earlier in the week peters out, whilst a lion’s share of market closures in Asia and Europe keep volumes subdued. Today marks the official inauguration of the OPEC+ output curtailment pact, albeit markets have already priced in the event. “The output cuts while significant may not be enough to fully offset demand destruction in the global market in the short term and the inventory build-up could continue for the rest of 2Q20, though at a slower pace”, ING reaffirms. That being said, reports noted that Iraq could face difficulties in adhering to its obligations under the deal. WTI June trades on either side of USD 19/bbl for a large part of the session before dipping below the psychological USD 18.50/bbl (high USD 20.50/bbl), whilst Brent July also resides closer to the bottom of its current USD 27.67-29.67/bbl intraday band.&nbsp; <strong>Spot gold</strong> remains on the backfoot sub USD 1700/oz, with some attributing a correction amid a lack of fresh buyers.<strong> Copper</strong> continues its deterioration throughout the session on the risk-averse tone and absence of regional participants including its largest buyer China – prices eye the 24th Apr low at USD 2.30/lb.</p><p>US President Trump said the US has no plans to take equity stakes in energy companies and does not plan to nationalize oil firms, according to an Energy Department spokesperson. (Newswires)</p><p>Iraq could reportedly face difficulties to cut up to 1mln BPD in line with OPEC+ deal and said it is still in talks with international oil companies for a deal to cut output in line with the agreement, according to sources.

Hence, consolidation rather than clear conviction one way or the other has panned out in the absence of other European, and especially core Eurozone equivalents to provide outside impetus or guidance via distraction. Moreover, US Treasuries have hardly stepped in to fill the void, with trade extremely subdued and volumes light due to Labour Day, awaiting the final Markit PMI, manufacturing ISM and construction spending to a lesser degree.</p>",

Moreover, some payback after hefty month end gains has ensued, with Cable backing off further from 1.2600+ highs after failing to sustain momentum to test mid-April peaks and a key technical level in the form of the 200 DMA (1.2648 and 1.2654 respectively). Meanwhile, the Pound is also unwinding more upside vs the Euro as the cross rebounds further from sub-0.8700 levels towards 0.8750 and back above the 200 DMA yet again (now around 0.8722) on the usual RHS for fixing dynamic. For the record, an even weaker than prelim manufacturing PMI, collapse in consumer credit and miss in mortgage approvals were all largely brushed aside, along with significantly stronger than forecast Nationwide house prices.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major laggards, and in the case of the Aussie and Kiwi also the notable underperformers as overall aversion is compounded by a bearish research note from Westpac overnight. In short, the bank based its bleak outlook for the Antipodeans on prospects of ‘brutal’ earnings and data in coming weeks, and on that note AIG manufacturing PMI plunged deep below 50, while ANZ consumer confidence dropped to sub-100. Aud/Usd has duly retreated from 0.6500+ to under 0.6450 and Nzd/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6100 handle with Aud/Nzd pivoting 1.0600. Elsewhere, the Loonie has detached further from its close crude correlation, albeit with oil prices recoiling this is also keeping Usd/Cad afloat near 1.4050 vs 1.3850 at one stage on Thursday, pending the possible appointment of a new BoC Governor later today and Canada’s manufacturing PMI. Similarly, the Scandinavian Crowns have been scuppered by the downturn in crude and risk appetite, with Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek both nudging the tops of ranges near 11.3300 and 10.7500 respectively.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All benefiting from the aforementioned ongoing Buck weakness, as the Yen bounces from circa 107.40, Franc eyes 0.9600 and Euro grinds closer to 1.1000 having breached the 55 DMA (1.0949) and yesterday’s best (1.0972) to expose resistance at 1.0991 before the 200 DMA (1.1035).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The ramp up in US vs China vitriol over the coronavirus has obviously taken its toll on the Yuan, as Usd/Cnh extends beyond 7.1300, but the contagion is spreading through the region like the global pandemic itself with Usd/Try up around 7.0400, Usd/Rub back over 75.0000 to name and highlight just a few.</p>",

        "subject": "PRIMER: US April ISM manufacturing survey due 1000 ET/1500 BST; the survey will fully reflect the COVID fallout, and is expected to drop sharply",
        "content": "<ul><li>The street looks for the manufacturing ISM survey to fall to 36.9 in April (range: 30.0 to 48.7) from 49.1 in March, as the nationwide shutdowns hit activity in April. Some desks are looking for an even deeper fall, possibly printing a low for the series not seen in decades (NOTE: the low in 2008 was 34.5, and in 1980 a low of 29.4 was printed). Naturally, this all highlights how the margin for error will be quite wide, with regards to expectations.</li><li>The March ISM data did not fully reflect the COVID fallout – that is expected to be seen in today’s April data. The March survey’s dip was modest, and was likely due to firms responding before lockdown measures had taken hold.</li><li>In terms of April, while the read from regional manufacturing surveys is mixed, there is clearly a downside bias. But the regional data might not have all that much predictive power for the April surveys. Pantheon Macroeconomics explains that “over the previous year, both of our ISM models, based on the regional surveys, were consistently too bullish; none of the regional numbers cover the US west of the Rockies, they overstated the strength of the national economy as the trade war hurt the China sensitive West Coast.” However, in March, the focus was the virus, not the trade war, and one Pantheon’s the models flipped into understating the national ISM. “We just don't know if this continued into April, so our forecast, 36, splits the difference between the models.”</li><li>Pantheon Macroeconomics will be paying attention to the supplier delivery index; “The headline index is the average of five components, and the supplier delivery element jumped sharply in March, offsetting some of the weakness in orders, production and employment,” and the consultancy explains that “usually, a rising supplier delivery index is a symptom of strong demand straining supply chains late in the cycle, but this time it captured the impact of the disruption in the flow of materials and goods from China, thanks to the coronavirus.” And in today’s April data, Pantheon expects the “strength” in supplier deliveries to be swamped by meltdowns in the other components.</li><li>In terms of the hard data, March industrial production fell by the largest monthly amount since WW2 (April data might be even worse). Credit Suisse says that manufacturing momentum is likely to fall -50% (3m/3m) in the summer, but the bank looks for a sharp rebound later in the year as shutdown measures ease. With that said, the high uncertainty is likely to limit investment and consumer spending going forward, CS believes, and the level of output is likely to remain below the pre-COVID peak in the medium-term.</li></ul>",

Amazon shares declined around 5% in extended trade after mixed results in which the Co. missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts and noted it expects to spend its entire USD 4bln of operating profit on COVID-related expenses, while Apple initially gained after it beat on top and bottom lines, boosted its share buyback by USD 50bln and raised its dividend, although the gains were only brief as the results were clouded by weaker than expected iPhone and iPad sales and after the tech giant refrained from providing a Q3 outlook. ASX 200 (-3.5%) was the laggard with downside led by heavy losses in the commodity related sectors and a slump in the top-weighted financials with selling exacerbated by profit taking after the index had rallied to its highest level in 6 weeks and notched its best month on record for April. Nikkei 225 (-2.5%) also suffered firm losses amid a slew of earnings and after Tokyo Core CPI data turned negative to trigger fears of a return to deflation, while reports also noted that PM Abe is to formally decide to extend the state of emergency due to coronavirus on Monday. As a reminder, markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were shut alongside most of the regional bourses, although China’s tensions with US remained in the spotlight after comments from US President who suggested he has seen evidence the virus had originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and that he can do tariffs to respond to China, with sources also later noting the US is considering blocking government retirement savings funds from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk..</p><p><strong>*EUROPEAN LABOR DAY MARKET CLOSURES – UK REMAINS OPEN*</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Euronext Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Lisbon</strong></li><li><strong>Xetra, Boerse Frankfurt</strong></li><li><strong>Vienna Stock Exchange</strong></li><li><strong>SIX Swiss Exchange</strong></li><li><strong>Bolsa de Madrid</strong></li><li><strong>Borsa Italiana</strong></li><li><strong>Oslo Stock Exchange</strong></li><li><strong>OMX Nordic (Stockholm, Helsinki)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>BHP (BHP LN)</strong> – Moody’s affirms “A2” rating; outlook “Stable”.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>The tone in Asia was subdued owing to the mass closures in the region for Labor Day and following the negative handover from Wall St due </strong>to month-end rebalancing and with futures pressured after hours following mega-cap earnings from Amazon and Apple. Amazon shares declined around 5% in extended trade after mixed results in which the Co. missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts and noted it expects to spend its entire USD 4bln of operating profit on COVID-related expenses, while Apple initially gained after it beat on top and bottom lines, boosted its share buyback by USD 50bln and raised its dividend, although the gains were only brief as the results were clouded by weaker than expected iPhone and iPad sales and after the tech giant refrained from providing a Q3 outlook. <strong>ASX 200 (-3.5%)</strong> was the laggard with downside led by heavy losses in the commodity related sectors and a slump in the top-weighted financials with selling exacerbated by profit taking after the index had rallied to its highest level in 6 weeks and notched its best month on record for April. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.5%)</strong> also suffered firm losses amid a slew of earnings and after Tokyo Core CPI data turned negative to trigger fears of a return to deflation, while reports also noted that PM Abe is to formally decide to extend the state of emergency due to coronavirus on Monday. As a reminder, markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were shut alongside most of the regional bourses, although China’s tensions with US remained in the spotlight after comments from US President who suggested he has seen evidence the virus had originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and that he can do tariffs to respond to China, with sources also later noting the US is considering blocking government retirement savings funds from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid spillover selling from T-notes which had reversed intraday gains and briefly fell below 139.00 amid heavy supply including Boeing’s USD 25bln 7-tranche offering, while JGB prices were also hampered by weaker demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr, 5yr, 10yr &amp; 20yr JGBs.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said the China trade deal is now secondary to what China did regarding the virus and that he has seen evidence the virus had originated from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China</strong>, while he stated that he cannot say why he has a high degree the virus originated there but suggested he can do tariffs to respond to China. Furthermore, reports later noted that President Trump is exploring blocking government retirement savings fund Thrift Savings Plan, from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>White House is mulling plans to punish or demand financial compensation from China over COVID-19 handling with the measures being considered said to include asking for monetary damages</strong>, stripping China of sovereign immunity allowing it to be sued and considering the US cancelling part of its debt obligations to China. <strong>However, NEC Director Kudlow later denied that the US would cancel debt obligations to China</strong>. (Washington Post/CNBC)</p><p>BoJ minutes from March meeting stated that Japan's economic activity had been weak recently due mainly to the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 and was likely to remain so for the time being mainly affected by the outbreak of the disease. Members concurred that the outlook for prices was likely to be somewhat weak for the time being, partly due to the effects of the decline in crude oil prices, while several board members said consumer and household sentiment could sour rapidly if markets remain unstable. Furthermore, members concurred that financial conditions in Japan were accommodative on the whole but had become less so and a few members said it was uncertain whether the economy can make a strong rebound once virus was contained.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the risk averse tone and comments from US President Trump regarding protecting the dollar helped <strong>DXY</strong> bounce back to reclaim the 99.00 level but with the recovery only marginal compared to the prior day’s losses which were attributed to month-end flows and post-ECB strength in <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong>. As such, the single currency held on to most its recent gains and traded steady around the 1.0950 level. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also pared back some of its gains and extended its retreat from 1.2600 despite recent optimism by UK PM Johnson who suggested the country has passed the peak and that a comprehensive plan on reopening will be released next week, while comments from trade body Make UK were less encouraging as it suggested factory output risks declining by more than half in Q2 with 80% of manufacturers reporting a drop in orders. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were mostly driven by the safe-haven flows and antipodeans also declined with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> giving up the 0.6500 and 0.6100 handles respectively amid the subdued risk tone and with a Westpac note bearish on the pairs as it anticipates brutal economic and earnings data in the approaching weeks. In addition, underperformance in CNH contributed to the pressure for the China-exposed currencies with USD/CNH surging nearly 500 pips to test 7.1300 to the upside after President Trump’s tariff suggestion.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures continued to make up for lost ground which saw the June contract briefly break back above the USD 20/bbl level with the OPEC+ agreement taking effect from today. However, gains were limited amid the lack of overnight participants due to the mass closures and amid reports Iraq could face difficulties in adhering to its obligations under the deal. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> languished after recently slipping below the USD 1700/oz level and with the mild overnight rebound in the greenback containing the precious metal near session lows, while <strong>copper</strong> deteriorated throughout the session on the risk averse tone and absence of regional participants including its largest buyer China.</p><p>US President Trump said the US has no plans to take equity stakes in energy companies and does not plan to nationalize oil firms, according to an Energy Department spokesperson. (Newswires)</p><p>Iraq could reportedly face difficulties to cut up to 1mln BPD in line with OPEC+ deal and said it is still in talks with international oil companies for a deal to cut output in line with the agreement, according to sources.

(Yonhap)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>A choppy session for the TPLEX, which had initially gotten off on the front-foot amid receding risk appetite, before reversing course into the settlement as IG corporate supply flooded. Disappointing GDP figures out of Europe, although expected, alongside month-end flows (read below) supported Treasuries heading into the US session. Another round of dire US data left the door open to inflows, and ECB’s Lagarde alluding to further stimulus to come. However, selling pressure began in the latter part of the session, in a steepening fashion. The selling pressure was likely a function of both month-end flows and corporate supply, where around ten IG issuers came to the dollar market as corporates emerge from the other side of earnings. Most notably, Boeing, who launched USD 25bln across seven tranches (3s, 5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) with orders books reportedly reaching above USD 75bln for the - on average - T+450bps issue. IFR noted that April set a monthly IG issuance record of USD 288bln. By settlement, on the Treasury curve, 2s unch at 20bps, 10s unch at 63bps, 30s +3bps at 1.27%. Note that LIBOR continued to fall with the 3-month down by 13bps although nearby Eurodollars didn’t budge again today. US T-note futures (M0) settled 3 ticks higher at 139-02.</p><p>Fed widened access to its Paycheck Protection Program Facility to include all SBA-approved lenders including non-depository institutions, while it added that eligible borrowers will be able to pledge entire PPP loans that they purchased as collateral to the PPPLF.

Amazon shares declined around 5% in extended trade after mixed results in which the Co. missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts and noted it expects to spend its entire USD 4bln of operating profit on COVID-related expenses, while Apple initially gained after it beat on top and bottom lines, boosted its share buyback by USD 50bln and raised its dividend, although the gains were only brief as the results were clouded by weaker than expected iPhone and iPad sales and after the tech giant refrained from providing a Q3 outlook. ASX 200 (-3.5%) was the laggard with downside led by heavy losses in the commodity related sectors and a slump in the top-weighted financials with selling exacerbated by profit taking after the index had rallied to its highest level in 6 weeks and notched its best month on record for April. Nikkei 225 (-2.5%) also suffered firm losses amid a slew of earnings and after Tokyo Core CPI data turned negative to trigger fears of a return to deflation, while reports also noted that PM Abe is to formally decide to extend the state of emergency due to coronavirus on Monday. As a reminder, markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were shut alongside most of the regional bourses, although China’s tensions with US remained in the spotlight after comments from US President who suggested he has seen evidence the virus had originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and that he can do tariffs to respond to China, with sources also later noting the US is considering blocking government retirement savings funds from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid spillover selling from T-notes which had reversed intraday gains and briefly fell below 139.00 amid heavy supply including Boeing’s USD 25bln 7-tranche offering, while JGB prices were also hampered by weaker demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr, 5yr, 10yr &amp; 20yr JGBs.</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Mass closures and pessimism on US mega-cap earnings sets a subdued Asia environment",
        "content": "<p>The tone in Asia is subdued owing to the mass closures in the region for Labor Day and following the negative handover from Wall St due to month-end rebalancing, worser than expected jobless claims data and with futures pressured after hours following a couple of mega-cap earnings from Amazon and Apple. Amazon shares declined around 5% in extended trade after mixed results in which the Co. missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts and noted it expects to spend its entire USD 4bln of operating profit on COVID-related expenses, while Apple initially gained after it beat on top and bottom lines and boosted its share buyback by USD 50bln and raised its dividend, although the gains were only brief as the results were clouded by weaker than expected iPhone and iPad sales and after the tech giant refrained from providing a Q3 outlook. ASX 200 (-3.7%) is the laggard with downside led by heavy losses in the commodity related sectors and slump in the top-weighted financials with selling exacerbated by profit taking after the index had rallied to its highest level in 6 weeks and notched its best month on record for April. Nikkei 225 (-2.6%) also suffers firm losses amid a slew of earnings and after Tokyo Core CPI data turned negative to trigger fears of a return to deflation, while reports also noted that PM Abe is to formally decide to extend the state of emergency due to coronavirus on Monday. As a reminder, markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were shut alongside most of the regional bourses, although China’s tensions with US remained in the spotlight after comments from US President who suggested he has seen evidence the virus had originated from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China and that he can do tariffs to respond to China, with sources also later noting the White House is exploring blocking a government retirement savings fund from investing in Chinese equities deemed a national security risk.</p><p>In FX markets, the risk averse tone and comments from US President Trump regarding protecting the dollar has helped DXY bounce back to reclaim the 99.00 level but with the recovery only marginal compared to the prior day’s losses which were attributed to month-end flows, weak jobless data and post-ECB strength in EUR/USD. As such, the single currency holds on to most its recent gains and trades steady around the 1.0950 level after the ECB meeting where the central bank maintained rates as expected, eased TLTRO conditions and announced to conduct PELTROs to support liquidity conditions but kept the PEPP amount unchanged which disappointed hopes for a boost to the program. GBP/USD also pared back some of its gains and extends its retreat from 1.2600 despite recent optimism by UK PM Johnson who suggested the country has passed the peak and that a comprehensive plan on reopening will be released next week, while comments from trade body Make UK were less encouraging as it suggested factory output risks declining by more than half in Q2 with 80% of manufacturers reporting a drop in orders. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mostly driven by the safe-haven flows and antipodeans also declined with AUD/USD and NZD/USD giving up the 0.6500 and 0.6100 handles respectively amid the subdued risk tone and with a Westpac note bearish on the pairs as it anticipates brutal economic and earnings data in the approaching weeks. In addition, underperformance in CNH also contributed to the pressure for the China-exposed currencies with USD/CNH surging nearly 500 pips to test 7.1300 to the upside after President Trump’s tariff suggestion.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are weaker amid spillover selling from T-notes which reversed intraday gains and briefly fell below 139.00 amid heavy supply including Boeing’s USD 25bln 7-tranche offering, while focus shifts to the enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr, 5yr, 10yr &amp; 20yr JGBs.</p>",
