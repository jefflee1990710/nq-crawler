Horton.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP:</strong> Market’s traded with a cautious tone to start the week following a pullback on tariff rollbacks from US President Trump and a lack of pertinent China updates over the weekend, in addition to lighter volume due to Veterans Day in the US. Intensified Geopolitical concerns over in Hong Kong also weighed on sentiment in early trade as violence picked up from both protestors and the police, working against BABA’s record volume Singles’ Day; China CPI/PPI didn’t help too, as CPI hit a 7-year high, exceeding the PBoC’s target. US cash equity markets opened lower following on from the downbeat EU session in a quiet day, although post open US Equity futures found some bids. Defensive sectors were the outperformers (albeit still in the red) on the open, although the sentiment pick up in the session saw a sector reversal throughout the session. KKR reportedly made a formal approach to WBA in what would be history’s largest LBO, boosting the pharmacy sub-sector. BA was boosted on a 737 MAX status update, with deliveries planned for year-end. Desks are becoming increasingly observant of the lack of volatility in markets, where the VIX lies close to YTD lows, with short VIX futures speculators holding their largest ever position; such low volatility has frequently been reversed, and sharply, in the past, with investors cautious of risk events which could flip the dial going into year-end - the breakdown of US-China trade talks/deal sits at the forefront of potential events that could lead the reversal.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (HK/TUR/IR): </strong>Over the weekend protests in Hong Kong continued for the 24th consecutive week with further escalation from protestors and police. Global Times Editor Hu Xijin tweeted a video of a civilian arguing with a protestor about their methods, which the protester responded by setting alight the civilian, an act which Hu Xijin referred to as “behaving like ISIS members”. The police used live rounds again on a protestor at close range, who is now the third person shot throughout the ordeal. HK Chief Executive Carrie Lam responded to the escalation noting it will not result in the government yielding to the protestors demands. A US official stated the US condemns the violence from both police and protestors, and urged both parties to de-escalate the matter. Over in Turkey, US National Security Advisor O’Brien stated the US is ready to economically punish Turkey unless it gives up its Russian made S-400 defence missile systems. The announcement comes ahead of US President Trump’s meeting with Turkey’s President Erdogan meeting on the 13th November, and follows comments last week from Turkey announced on the 2nd delivery of the S-400 missile defence system has been delayed, but the first delivery back in July led to the US removing Turkey from its F-35 programme. Following the removal, Turkey have been in talks with Russia regarding their SU-35 jets. On Iran, President Trump tweeted it would be a very positive step if Iran is able to turn over kidnapped former FBI Agent Robert Levinson to the US, but also suggested Iran is enriching uranium which would be a very bad step. An IAEA report confirmed Iran is enriching uranium by up to 4.5%, above the deals limit of 3.67%; last week Iran’s Rouhani stated they have the ability to take uranium enrichment levels to 20% from the current 5% level. The IAEA noted Iran added two machines which are in use, and France Britain and Germany reiterated their concerns, affirming their readiness to consider all mechanisms under the act to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>* CHINA CPI: </strong>China's consumer price index rose in October at a rate of 3.8% Y/Y, exceeding the forecast 3.4%, and rising from September's 3.0%. The Y/Y print was the highest since 2012, and breached policymakers' 3.0% target, with the upside driven by rising pork prices. The PPI data was also grim, declining by 1.6% Y/Y against an expected decline of 1.2%. Analysts said the drag from the real estate sector, which is under pressure after the government's crackdown on speculative sales as well as tightening financial conditions for developers, could become more pronounced, keeping PPI growth in negative territory.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.38 LOWER AT USD 56.86/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.33 AT USD 62.18/BBL</strong>. Crude markets staged a decent bounce off of lows, a result of wider subdued risk sentiment, but was unable to finish the session in the green, with the move higher coinciding with a positive US equity cash open; front month WTI and Brent futures fell to lows of USD 56.30/bbl and USD 61.60/bbl respectively on the day, before rebounding as high as USD 57.35/bbl and USD 62.75/bbl. However, recent highs at USD 57.90/bbl and USD 63.50/bbl are still some way off. Prior to the complex’s turnaround, a number of factors had been weighing on sentiment: US President Trump clarified that he has not yet agreed to rollback tariffs on China, Iran announced a mammoth oil reserve discovery that would increase the country’s proven reserves by a third and, finally, Oman’s Oil Minister said deeper cuts by the OPEC+ are unlikely and the extension of the pact is likely. Later during US hours, and less consequentially for the market, Oman’s Oman Oil Minister affirmed the country’s commitment to the OPEC+ agreement, noting that oil at USD 60/bbl is suitable for Oman and its economy. USD 10-15bln in investment has been allocated to the country's oil and gas sector over the next three years, with the investment mainly in petrochemicals, Oman’s oil minister added. In terms of other crude specific news flow, a number of refineries updates on the state of operations; Motiva Port Arthur’s (636k BPD) refinery hydrotreater &amp; reformer and Valero’s Memphis Tennessee refinery (195k BPD) are now operating normally after restarts. Finally, Saudi oil production in October was 10.3mln BPD (prev. 9.9mln BPD), in line with its OPEC+ commitment, according to industry sources, who also noted that the 400k BPD increase in production was due to Saudi Aramco replenishing its oil inventories after 14 September attacks.</p><p><strong>* TREASURY WRAP: </strong>Treasury futures settled little changed due to a mild risk appetite in the US session bringing the sector off its highs from earlier on. Cash markets were closed on Monday due to Veterans Day in the US, with volumes across most asset classes subdued in general.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 3087, NASDAQ-100 -0.2% at 8242, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27694</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.3%, Consumer Staples -0.2%, Energy -0.6%, Financials -0.3%, Health Care -0.4%, Industrials 0.1%, Information Technology 0.1%, Materials -0.1%, Telecommunication Services -0.4%, Utilities -0.7%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gapped higher on the open after reports KKR (KKR) had formally approached the pharmacy giant for an LBO, in what would be the largest LBO in history. Boeing (BA) surged after updating that it sees 737 deliveries resuming in December with commercial services resuming in January. Alibaba (BABA) posted record sales figures for its Singles’ Day although the ADR was under pressure, likely owing to the ramp up in Hong Kong violence casting a shadow over the region. Apple (AAPL) pared back some premarket losses which were induced by reports it had awarded some Taiwan companies manufacturing orders due to issues in its Chinese supply chain. Tesla (TSLA) caught a bid from a positive mention at Jefferies, which raised its PT to USD 400 from USD 300, citing growth potential next year after stabilisation this year. Qualcomm (QCOM) weighed on semis after being downgraded to Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley on valuation concerns. US steel producers were hit after weak Chinese data raised demand concerns. Cisco (CSCO) was downgraded to Neutral at Piper Jaffray on lack of a meaningful catalyst, seeing the stock underperform. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) came under pressure from a WSJ report that WeWork was looking to appoint T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere, in addition to other candidates, as its new top dog.</p><p><strong>*</strong> <strong>UK ELECTION/BREXIT: </strong>Brexit Party Leader Farage announced that he would be withdrawing candidates at the coming General Election, out of fears that if he fielded all 600 candidates, the party would split the Brexit vote and result in a hung parliament that would be less able to deliver Brexit. Farage announced that he would not contest the conservatives in the 317 seats that they won in the last election and would instead focus on Labour seats who broke their election manifesto (a reference to the fact that in 2017, Labour ran on a manifesto to deliver Brexit but the Party has since pivoted to wanting a second referendum). The news was interpreted as sterling positive; by not running against the Conservatives in most constituencies, Farage’s move is seen as making a Conservative majority more likely, which is the market’s preferred outcome given that PM Johnson already has a deal with the EU and, with a majority, could take the UK out of the EU with a deal by the end of January, removing the cloud of uncertainty keeping investors in the UK at bay. The prospect of a hung-parliament or a Labour led government is seen as prolonging uncertainty; the former would be unlikely to deliver Johnson’s Brexit deal without another delay and in the latter case, the UK could face another delay, then a second referendum on Brexit and possible Scottish Independence (Labour may form a coalition with the SNP, who want Scottish Independence). Electoral Calculus has taken into account the effect of the Brexit Party not contesting the Tories, which they see as equating to an additional 12 seats to a total of 382, a clear majority (326 needed for a majority). Looking ahead, focus turns to whether the Brexit Party will be active in seats that the Conservative Party wishes to target and subsequently the Remain Alliance’s response to this; YouGov take the stance that Farage’s announcement is unlikely to be a ‘game changing’ announcement for the election result.</p><p><strong>* UK DATA:</strong> A raft of UK data showed that the economy grew slightly slower than expected in Q3, clocking a 0.3% rate of expansion vs expectations for 0.4%, the prior was also revised down by 0.1% to 0.2%. The Y/Y metric was also slightly soft, at 1.0% vs expectations for 1.1%, where the prior was also revised lower by 1/10th to 1%. According to the UK ONS, GDP grew steadily in the third quarter, mainly thanks to a strong July. Services again led the way with construction also performing well, ONS added, although “manufacturing failed to grow as falls in many industries were offset by car production bouncing back following April shutdowns.\" Metrics for Manufacturing and Industrial output also fell, -0.4% and -0.3% M/M, respectively; a deeper fall than analyst expectations. However, on the plus-side Business Investment was better than expected, but still contracted for the quarter. Business Investment has now fallen every quarter since 2018 (with the exception of Q1 2019 due to accounting changes, notes ING). “Even if the Conservatives Party does win a majority at the forthcoming election – and the deal is swiftly ratified – focus will quickly turn to the transition period” cautions ING, which keeps alive the prospect of a cliff-edge scenario, not dissimilar to a no deal, live for most firms. Therefore, the bank concludes, they do not expect a substantial rebound in investment anytime soon.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD pared back some of its weekly rally last week as DXY heads back towards the 98.00 handle after falling through the 50dma at 98.29. Today’s FX ranges however were fairly subdued on a quiet news day amid Veteran’s Day, and the buck traded within a narrow range between 98.13 and 98.32. GBP an outperformer today as Brexit Party’s Nigel Farage announced his party will not be contesting any conservative led seats as he was worried about a hung parliament if he were to go ahead with his initial plan after UK PM Johnson rejected his leave alliance deal. GBP rallied to highs just shy of 1.29 on the news as it were deemed a win to the conservative party, who have a set Brexit plan if they were too gain a majority in the UK election. The morning UK data initially saw brief downside on GDP misses, however pared back potentially on the stronger business investment. Havens were mixed with CHF &amp; JPY slightly bid in the morning as geopolitical concerns in Hong Kong dampened sentiment and a continuation from US President Trump’s comments on Friday who denied agreeing to a rollback of tariffs. This weekend saw a lack of pertinent updates. USDJPY breached 109.00 to the downside overnight, however sentiment turned at the US open and USDJPY remains around the 109-handle heading into Asia trade. XAU traded lower to start the week initially breaching 1450 to the downside, albeit half the the move was pared and now trades around the 1457 mark within a daily range of 1449 and 1466. NZD joins GBP as an outperformer to start the week after the NZIER’s shadow policy makers made the case for an unchanged OCR in contrast to 60% anticipating a ¼ point ease ahead of its meeting this week. AUD traded within a thin 20-pip range but remained slightly subdued as it flirted around the 0.6850 level throughout the session. In EMFX, ZAR and TRY were weaker to start the week. The former continues to hold worries about its state utility company Eskom, and the latter on further worries in regard to its S-400 purchases, where National Sec. Adviser O’Brien noted the US remains ready to economically punish Turkey unless it gives up the defence system. MXN also traded weaker today. BRL however, traded firmer seemingly paring back some of Friday's losses which followed the announcement its former president Lula was released from prison.</p><p><strong>* SPANISH ELECTION:</strong> As expected, no party was able to win enough seats to secure an absolute majority. The left-wing parties lost some ground; Acting PM Sanchez’ centre-left PSOE won 120 seats (-3), left-wing Podemos won 35 (-7), while Mas Pais (a splinter from Podemos) won 3 seats. Meanwhile, the right put in a strong performance; centre right People’s Party won 88 (+22) and right-wing VOX won 52 (+28), although much was at the expense of centre right Cuidadanos, who won just 10 (-47). In terms of the smaller parties, the lay of the land is little moved; the two main Catalan parties lost 1 seat while the two main Basque nationalist parties gained one seat each. With the result largely as expected, wider market impact was limited, although Bonos and Spanish Banks were under pressure in early Monday trade. In terms of what is next; the block of right-wing parties (People’s Party, VOX and Cuidadanos), who have 150 seats, fall short of the 176 needed to form a working coalition. Conversely, a left-wing coalition (PSOE, Podemos, Mas Pais and regional Catalan and Basque parties) form a working coalition. However, the relationship between PSOE and the Catalan separatist parties is fraught on account of PSOE’s anti-independence stance; a coalition between these parties failed last time around and seems unlikely to succeed this time. Minus the Catalan parties, a PSOE, Podemos, Mas Pais and regional Basque party coalition would only have 170 seats, still short of the 176 needed. This all means a minority government is the likely outcome, should enough parties abstain during the second vote to install a government. As the largest party, PSOE are likely to pursue this strategy. Of course, without a working majority, the stability of any PSOE-led minority government is likely to be low.</p>",

However, recent highs at USD 57.90/bbl and USD 63.50/bbl are still some way off. Prior to the complex’s turnaround, a number of factors had been weighing on sentiment: US President Trump clarified that he has not yet agreed to rollback tariffs on China, Iran announced a mammoth oil reserve discovery that would increase the country’s proven reserves by a third and, finally, Oman’s Oil Minister said deeper cuts by the OPEC+ are unlikely and the extension of the pact is likely. Later during US hours, and less consequentially for the market, Oman’s Oman Oil Minister affirmed the country’s commitment to the OPEC+ agreement, noting that oil at USD 60/bbl is suitable for Oman and its economy. USD 10-15bln in investment has been allocated to the country's oil and gas sector over the next three years, with the investment mainly in petrochemicals, Oman’s oil minister added. In terms of other crude specific news flow, a number of refineries updates on the state of operations; Motiva Port Arthur’s (636k BPD) refinery hydrotreater &amp; reformer and Valero’s Memphis Tennessee refinery (195k BPD) are now operating normally after restarts. Finally, Saudi oil production in October was 10.3mln BPD (prev. 9.9mln BPD), in line with its OPEC+ commitment, according to industry sources, who also noted that the 400k BPD increase in production was due to Saudi Aramco replenishing its oil inventories after 14 September attacks.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Sterling advances as Brexit Party boosts Tory GE majority chances",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Pound was only just back on the 1.2800 handle and struggling to breach 0.8600 vs the Dollar and Euro respectively ahead of the deluge of UK data, and was briefly undermined by relatively small headline misses against consensus before taking some solace from the fact that q/q GDP turned positive in Q3. However, Sterling really got a boost and overtook the Kiwi (T-20 cricket style) when Brexit Party leader Farage announced that he had now received assurances from his Conservative counterpart Johnson that convinced him to withdraw candidates that would have contested 317 seats won by the Tories in 2017. Moreover, Farage said his Party will run against Labour MPs that have broken their manifesto and Cable got to within pips of 1.2900 before fading, while Eur/Gbp fell to circa 0.8558 as bookies and spread betters cut odds on a Conservative majority. Meanwhile, previous G10 front-runner, the Nzd, consolidated gains vs the Usd and Aud above 0.6350 and close to 1.0775 respectively as the clock ticks down to November’s RBNZ rate call and NZIER’s shadow policy makers made the case for an unchanged OCR in contrast to 60% anticipating a ¼ point ease. Conversely, the Aussie failed to derive any traction from a generally soft Greenback on US Treasury yield and curve realignment from significant bear-steepening last week (overall) amidst less trade optimism given President Trump’s denial about deciding to remove all Chinese tariffs. Aud/Usd is hovering around 0.6850 even though the <strong>DXY</strong> slipped further from last week’s pinnacle set late on Friday at 98.408 to 98.127 at one stage.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>All still firmer vs the Buck, with the Franc straddling 0.9950 and single currency extending gains beyond a Fib (1.1030) to 1.1040+, but not quite mustering enough strength to challenge of trip 1 bn option expiries sitting between 1.10445-60. Meanwhile, the Yen pivoted 109.00 for the most part and was marginally undermined alongside Gold (tested Usd1450/oz) when risk sentiment tentatively improved.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Relative laggards with the Loonie meandering between 1.3215-35 and still smarting after last Friday’s worrying Canadian jobs data, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok rebounded further towards 10.7250 and 10.1100 respectively, with the Norwegian Crown also unsettled by softer than expected core CPI, but the Scandi Kronas paring some losses in late EU trade, latter alongside rebounding oil.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Cnh is back below 7.0000 vs the Usd on the aforementioned less US-China Phase 1 trade deal momentum, but other regional currencies regained some poise in thinner US holiday pm volumes (due to Veterans Day).</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* THE RESULT:</strong> As expected, the latest election has failed to break the country’s ongoing political impasse, with no party able to secure an absolute majority. As indicated in the polls, the left-wing parties lost some ground; Acting PM Sanchez’ centre-left PSEO won 120 seats (-3), left-wing Podemos won 35 (-7), while Mas Pais (a splinter from Podemos) won 3 seats. Meanwhile, the right put in a strong performance; centre right People’s Party won 88 (+22) and right-wing VOX won 52 (+28), although much was at the expense of centre-right Cuidadanos, who won just 10 (-47). In terms of the smaller parties, the lay of the land is little moved; the two main Catalan parties lost 1 seat while the two main Basque nationalist parties gained one seat each.</p><p><strong>* COALITION OR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: </strong>The block of right-wing parties (People’s Party, VOX and Cuidadanos) totals 150 seats, short of the 176 needed for a majority. Conversely, a left-wing coalition (PSOE, Podemos, Mas Pais and regional Catalan and Basque parties) could be enough to secure a majority. However, the relationship between PSOE and the Catalan separatist parties is fraught on account of PSOE’s anti-independence stance; a coalition between these parties failed last time around and seems unlikely to succeed this time. Minus the Catalan parties, a PSOE, Podemos, Mas Pais and regional Basque party coalition would only have 170 seats, still short of the 176 needed. However, a minority government can still be formed, if enough parties abstain during the second vote to install a government. As the largest party, PSOE are likely to pursue this strategy. Of course, without a working majority, the stability of any PSOE-led minority government is likely to be low.</p>",

Sectors are mostly lower with some buoyancy seen in defensives whilst cyclicals are in the red. Materials lead the pack to the downside amid a sentiment-driven slump in copper prices, in-turn providing some reprieve to industrial names. FTSE 100 modestly lags peers (cash fell below its 200 DMA at 7296) as the index bears the brunt of downside in heavyweight materials and energy stocks in lockstep with the respective complexes, whilst UK <strong>financials</strong> are hit on Moody’s downgrade of the UK’s outlook; some heavyweight UK losers include Glencore (-3.5%), Antofagasta (-3.5%), Standard Chartered (-2.5%), HSBC (-2.5%) and BP (-1.3%). Further for the banking index, Spanish banks are also under pressured in the aftermath of the Spanish election deadlock, which sees BBVA (-1.0%) and Santander (-1.8%) on the backfoot amid political uncertainty. Elsewhere, European luxury names fail to benefit from record China Singles Day sales (Alibaba -0.6% pre-market) amid the escalating situation in Hong Kong as region saw its 24th week of unrest and as a police officer shot a protestor with a live round – Burberry (-2.8%), LVMH (-0.3%), Pandora (-3.5%), Swatch (-1.8%) and Richemont (-1.8%) are all near the foot of their respective bourses. Finally, in terms of individual movers – Greggs (+15.0%) rose to the top of the pan-European index after the Co. once again upgraded outlook, whilst Novartis (+1.0%) after Co’s Sandoz unit announced an agreement for Aspen’s Japanese operations and assets, with expectations for the amount of deferred consideration not to exceed EUR 100mln.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>European Commission has suspended the investigation into <strong>Boeing (BA</strong>)/Embraer joint venture. (EC)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD </strong>- The Dollar has lost momentum against most major peers amidst a partial reversal in UST yields and curve re-flattening, with the DXY drifting back from Friday’s 98.408 highs into a 98.382-98.231 range. Risk sentiment has soured somewhat on several fronts, including US-China trade after President Trump clarified that no decision to lift existing tariffs as part of the Phase 1 deal has been taken, while weekend protests in HK escalated markedly and US-Turkey relations remain strained ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Erdogan later this week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD -</strong> The Kiwi is sharply outperforming in the run up to Wednesday’s RBNZ policy meeting with the market pricing in a 25 bp rate cut, but NZIER’s shadow board going against the roughly 2/3 consensus and looking for no change, albeit noting a more diverse range of views compared to the previous OCR decision. Nzd/Usd is firmly back above 0.6350, and also benefiting from favourable cross-flows as Aud/Nzd retreats through 1.0800 and the Aussie flounders just above 0.6850 on the aforementioned less positive US-China updates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR -</strong> All clawing back losses vs the Buck, with Cable trying to regain 1.2800+ status following a raft of UK data that was mildly disappointing in headline terms, but included some encouraging elements, like flat q/q business inventories and -0.2% construction output vs -0.5% forecast for both. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf have both pulled back from last week’s peaks to sub-109.00 and circa 0.9950, as the Yen and Franc retrieve some of their risk-related declines. Elsewhere, the Euro is testing Fib resistance at 1.1030 after some initial reticence on Spanish political grounds, but may be stymied ahead of decent option expiry interest from 1.1045-60 (1 bn).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/SEK/NOK - </strong>Relative laggards amidst weak crude prices and the broad downturn in risk appetite noted above, with the Loonie meandering between 1.3215-35 and still smarting after last Friday’s worrying Canadian jobs data, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok are both rebounding further towards 10.7250 and 10.1100 respectively, with the Norwegian Crown also unsettled by softer than expected core CPI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Losses against the Dollar are commonplace, but notable for the Yuan, Lira and Rand on the no full tariff rollback news, ongoing US-Turkey angst and SA Eskom production constraints. Meanwhile, the Mexican Peso awaits ip data in the absence of any US releases to drive Usd/Mxn due to the Veterans Day vacation north of the border.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZIER Shadow Board on average expect the RBNZ to remain on hold at this week’s meeting but the range of views has widened since the last meeting </strong>with an increased skew towards a higher OCR, while it noted that the recent data has been mixed.

However, the 10 year benchmarks retain an underlying bid within 169.60-99 and 131.21-130.85 parameters in contrast to Italian <strong>BTPs and Spanish Bonos</strong> that are feeling the brunt of a general retracement in risk sentiment and the latter on political stalemate following to clear majority for the PSOE.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Crude markets are lower, </strong>amid a cautious macro backdrop following mixed US/China trade headlines over the weekend. Supply side factors have also likely weighed on prices; a new oil field was discovered in Iran’s South-western province of Khuzestan and is said to contain 53 billion barrels of crude, which would increase the country’s proven oil reserves by one third. Moreover, Oman’s Oil Minister said deeper cuts by OPEC+ are unlikely and the extension of the pact is likely (in fitting with recent source reports) and, finally, the Keystone pipeline returned to service over the weekend following a leak at the end of last month. As such, WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 futures are trading in the USD 56.40/bbl and USD 61.70/bbl regions, having come off substantially from Friday’s highs of USD 57.40/bbl and USD 62.60/bbl. Also making the headlines, but less pertinent for crude markets for now, Saudi Aramco released the prospectus for its upcoming IPO over the weekend. The state oil giant will sell up to 0.5% of its shares to individual retail investors and will be restricted from issuing additional shares for a year after the IPO. According to the prospectus, the offering will begin on 17th November. In terms of metals; <strong>Gold prices</strong> have edged higher, assisted by the markets cautious tone, although the precious metal remains only slightly off recent lows around the USD 1460/oz level. “Investors have been liquidating gold as risk appetite appears to be returning to the market and demand for safe-haven assets slows down” observes ING, citing evidence from ETF investors, who have sold nearly 615k oz of gold over the past two days, taking total ETF holdings in gold to a one-month low of 81.68mln Oz as of 8 November. Elsewhere, the bank adds that the physical demand for gold faces pressure due to high prices and a pause by China on gold buying for forex reserves. Meanwhile, fragile risk sentiment have seen copper prices come under pressure, also weighed by broadly mixed data out of China; CPI beat expectations, largely driven by higher food prices, but PPI disappointed and provides yet more evidence that the country’s industrial sector is in deflation.</p><p><strong>Iran said it discovered an oilfield with 53bln barrels in southwest Iran.

Supply side factors have also likely weighed on prices; a new oil field was discovered in Iran’s South-western province of Khuzestan and is said to contain 53 billion barrels of crude, which would increase the country’s proven oil reserves by one third. Moreover, Oman’s Oil Minister said deeper cuts by OPEC+ are unlikely and the extension of the pact is likely (in fitting with recent source reports) and, finally, the Keystone pipeline returned to service over the weekend following a leak at the end of last month. As such, WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 futures are trading in the USD 56.40/bbl and USD 61.70/bbl regions, having come off substantially from Friday’s highs of USD 57.40/bbl and USD 62.60/bbl. Also making the headlines, but less pertinent for crude markets for now, Saudi Aramco released the prospectus for its upcoming IPO over the weekend. The state oil giant will sell up to 0.5% of its shares to individual retail investors and will be restricted from issuing additional shares for a year after the IPO. According to the prospectus, the offering will begin on 17th November. In terms of metals; <strong>Gold prices</strong> have edged higher, assisted by the markets cautious tone, although the precious metal remains only slightly off recent lows around the USD 1460/oz level. “Investors have been liquidating gold as risk appetite appears to be returning to the market and demand for safe-haven assets slows down” observes ING, citing evidence from ETF investors, who have sold nearly 615k oz of gold over the past two days, taking total ETF holdings in gold to a one-month low of 81.68mln Oz as of 8 November. Elsewhere, the bank adds that the physical demand for gold faces pressure due to high prices and a pause by China on gold buying for forex reserves. Meanwhile, fragile risk sentiment have seen copper prices come under pressure, also weighed by broadly mixed data out of China; CPI beat expectations, largely driven by higher food prices, but PPI disappointed and provides yet more evidence that the country’s industrial sector is in deflation.</p><p><strong>Iran said it discovered an oilfield with 53bln barrels in southwest Iran.

Elsewhere, the Euro is testing Fib resistance at 1.1030 after some initial reticence on Spanish political grounds, but may be stymied ahead of decent option expiry interest from 1.1045-60 (1 bn).</p><p><strong>CAD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Relative laggards amidst weak crude prices and the broad downturn in risk appetite noted above, with the Loonie meandering between 1.3215-35 and still smarting after last Friday’s worrying Canadian jobs data, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok are both rebounding further towards 10.7250 and 10.1100 respectively, with the Norwegian Crown also unsettled by softer than expected core CPI.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Losses against the Dollar are commonplace, but notable for the Yuan, Lira and Rand on the no full tariff rollback news, ongoing US-Turkey angst and SA Eskom production constraints. Meanwhile, the Mexican Peso awaits ip data in the absence of any US releases to drive Usd/Mxn due to the Veterans Day vacation north of the border.</p>",

The results showed PM Sanchez’s socialists won the most seats (120 out of 350), but fell short of the majority needed to break the deadlock and was actually down 3 seats from prior, while ING have also weighed in on EUR’s depreciation in which it suggested the single currency was emerging as a preferred funding currency amid expectations rates will remain at rock bottom throughout next year. <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was off worse levels and attempted to claw back some its recent lost ground, although its efforts have been hampered by resistance around 1.2800 and after Moody’s downgraded UK’s outlook to Negative from Stable. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and JPY-crosses were slightly pressured by the mostly risk-averse tone and antipodeans traded relatively stable with mild outperformance in <strong>NZD</strong> as <strong>AUD/NZD</strong> tested 1.0800 to the downside and with some continuing to push back against the consensus for a cut by the RBNZ this week including the NZIER ‘RBNZ Shadow Board’ which expects the RBNZ to remain on hold and suggested there has been an increased skew in the range of views towards a higher OCR.</p><p><strong>NZIER Shadow Board on average expect the RBNZ to remain on hold at this week’s meeting but the range of views has widened since the last meeting </strong>with an increased skew towards a higher OCR, while it noted that the recent data has been mixed.

Conversely, <strong>gold</strong> attempted to nurse some losses but remained near multi-month lows with the rebound restricted by a steady greenback, while copper was subdued amid the mostly risk averse tone and underperformance across the greater China region.</p><p>Baker Hughes US rig count: Oil rigs -7 at 684, nat gas rigs unchanged at 130, total rigs -5 at 817.

The T-Note was offered through the European session before reversing course in the latter end of the day, triggered by US President Trump saying he had not yet decided whether to roll back China tariffs. More broadly, looking at the week, the TPLEX has seen significant amount of selling, with yields at levels not seen since July, off their lows in late-August/early-September. Given the reported progress in US-China trade, Treasury refunding, ramped up corporate issuance and a Fed now (presumably) on pause, the selling pressure on the TPLEX is of little surprise in this first week of November. T-note futures (Z9) settled unchanged at 128-12+.</p><p><strong>Fed’s Williams (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said he expects interest rates will be very low for the foreseeable future and that global growth will be modest, while he added that monetary policy is moderately accommodative and that he was concerned about persistently low inflation.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly negative with sentiment clouded by uncertainty brought on by the temperamental trade headlines including comments from US President Trump who was optimistic on trade talks but clarified that he has not yet agreed to rollback tariffs on China. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed with strength in defensive stocks and resilience in the financials sector keeping Australia afloat, while the mood in Tokyo has deteriorated on flows into its currency and as participants digest weaker than expected Machine Orders, as well as a slew of corporate earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) are the laggards amid the ongoing US-China trade uncertainty, continued PBoC liquidity inaction and mixed Chinese inflation data. Hong Kong markets are also taking the brunt of further unrest in the city in which police were reported to have fired live rounds at protesters, while some of the losses for the mainland have been stemmed amid euphoria from a potential record-breaking Singles’ Day where sales in the first 90 minutes alone have already reached halfway of the USD 31bln record set for the whole day last year.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat but remains above the 98.00 level following last week’s rally and amid weakness in its major counterparts with EUR/USD languishing near the bottom end of the 1.1000 handle after a stalemate in the Spanish election. The results showed PM Sanchez’s socialists won the most seats (120 out of 350), but fell short of the majority needed to break the deadlock and was actually down 3 seats from prior, while ING have also weighed in on EUR’s depreciation in which it suggested the single currency was emerging as a preferred funding currency amid expectations rates will remain at rock bottom throughout next year. GBP/USD is off worse levels and attempts to claw back some its recent lost ground, although its efforts have been hampered by resistance around 1.2800 and after Moody’s downgraded UK’s outlook to Negative from Stable. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are slightly pressured by the mostly risk-averse tone and antipodeans trade relatively stable with mild outperformance in NZD as AUD/NZD attempts a breakdown of the 1.0800 handle, and with some continuing to push back against the consensus for a cut by the RBNZ this week including the NZIER ‘RBNZ Shadow Board’ which expects the RBNZ to remain on hold and suggested there has been an increased skew in the range of views towards a higher OCR.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and have reclaimed the 153.00 level with upside supported by the predominantly negative performance across stocks and with the BoJ in the market for a respectable JPY 1.16tln of JGBs in up to 10yr maturities.</p>",
