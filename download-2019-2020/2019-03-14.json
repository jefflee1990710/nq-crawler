        "content": "<p>ASIA-PAC</p><p>US President Trump said he cannot say if the US will strike a final deal with China although talks are going very well, while there were separate comments from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that he is pleased with progress on trade talks with China and expects elements of Chinese trade talks to be resolved in the near future. (Newswires/CNBC)</p><p>China and US are said to delay Trump-Xi meeting until April as according to sources, while there were later source reports that China is proposing tying in an official state visit by President Xi to a US trade deal. Separately, White House expects a significant market pop with a significant China trade deal and advisors reportedly have said the Dow could pop 2,000 points according to Fox's Gasparino. (Newswires)</p><p>US is mulling targeted sanctions related to human rights violations in China's Xinjiang region, according to the State Department. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>UK/EU</p><p>UK lawmakers voted (412 vs 202) to accept the government's motion to extend the Article 50 process beyond 29th March. Furthermore, lawmakers had rejected Amendments E (302 for vs. 318 against) which calls on PM May to seek an Article 50 extension to avoid leaving the EU on 29th March without a deal and to provide parliamentary time for the HoC to find a majority for a different approach. Parliament also rejected Amendment I which proposed Parliament force a series of indicative votes on 20/March on the next Brexit steps and rejected Amendment H (85 for vs 334 against) which would have instructed UK PM May to request an extension of Article 50 of sufficient length for a referendum to be legislated for and held with options for leaving on terms determined by parliament or staying in the EU.</p><p>UK PM May spokesperson said May has given commitment to bring forward legislative measure required to change the exit date in law. The spokesperson also stated that A50 delay would not result in a transition period extension if a deal is reached but added that the government is still preparing for no-deal and that Parliament will discuss next steps on March 25th if Brexit deal fails. (Newswires)</p><p>If UK PM asked EU for an extension to the Article 50 process, EU might not make the decision at the 21st March summit and may schedule an emergency EU summit for a few days before the 29 March exit date, according to ITV's Peston. (ITV)</p><p>BoE's Haskel warned of risks to the UK jobs market, while he emphasised a data dependent approach and wants concrete evidence of rising inflation before favouring rate hikes. (FT)</p><p>UK Liberal Democrats party leader Vince Cable will step down in May. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Villeroy said guidance from the central bank prevents premature rate hike expectations and that ECB policy will depend on data. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>OPEC monthly report stated that OPEC crude production fell 221k bpd in February to average 30.55mln bpd according to secondary sources and that OPEC members bound by supply cut deal met 105% of the pledged reductions in February vs. 101% in early March. Furthermore, it stated total world oil demand growth in 2018 is estimated at 1.43mln bpd, down by 40k bpd from the previous estimate amid downward revisions in both OECD and non-OECD regions, while 2019 oil demand growth is forecast is maintained at around 1.24mln bpd. (Newswires)</p><p>Russia and Saudi energy delegates to meet in Baku on Sunday. (Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>US President Trump said the EU has been very tough to deal with and that if the EU doesn't talk to them, the US is going to tariff their products. Elsewhere, there were reports that the European Parliament failed to back the start of trade talks between the EU and US, while US President Trump also commented US looks forward to negotiating a 'large-scale' trade deal with the UK. (Newswires)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin urged members of Congress to pass the USMCA deal, while he added that he supports clean debt ceiling increase and called on Congress to raise the debt limit soon. (Newswires)</p><p>MARKET RECAP</p><p>General Electric (GE) opened higher today after CEO Larry Culp provided a promising outlook for the years ahead, despite 2019 being disappointing. Dollar General (DG) nosedived on the back of its earnings report which revealed a large amount of new stores to open will weigh on its bottom line. Apple (AAPL) caught a bid, helped by an “outperform” initiation at Cowen. TechnipFMC (FTI) was an outperformer whilst rumours floated it was the frontrunner for a contract from Equinor in Norway. Take-Two (TTWO) pares back Wednesday’s rally after Sony (SNE) denied speculation it was considering an acquisition. Bristol-Myers (BMY) underperformed on the back of a positive drug patent outcome for Celgene (CELG), which caused it to trade higher, making the merger deal more likely. SPX -0.09% at 2808, NDX -0.19% at 7243, DJI +0.03% at 25710.</p><p>Treasuries edged slightly lower on Thursday, with the T-plex ran into the session on a downward path where hedge funds were reported to be selling at the long-end, causing the curve to steepen. Although this was supported by CTAs covering their shorts just before the US equity open, with some block buyers in the front end, but this trend halted as Europeans began leaving their desks, keeping any price rallies limited. Going into the settlement, yields rose across the curve, long-end saw yields rose the most prolific with the 30-year up by c. 3.5bps. Spreads also widened further, where the 5s/30s at the greatest in 13 months and the 2s/30s greatest in 9 months. US T-note futures (M9) settled 5 ticks lower at 122-22+.</p>",

Both sides have indicated that are planning to arrange a meeting between the leaders at the earliest possible date, with Beijing said to be pushing for a formal state visit rather than a regular meeting. Analysts at Stratfor said that China's decision to push for an official state visit reflects Beijing's concern that a simple meeting between Trump and Xi may not produce an agreement, similar to the recent summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that abruptly ended without progress. \"Additional delays to a potential summit between Trump and Xi, alongside ongoing talks between both sides, increase the likelihood that the United States and China will simply extend their trade truce and postpone the signing of an actual trade deal,\" the geopolitical consultancy said. On trade, Trump himself said that he cannot say when a final China trade deal will be struck, and added talks were going well. On Europe, Trump was more belligerent, describing it as difficult to make progress with Europe, and threatened that if the Europeans do not want to talk, he will apply tariffs on their goods. Elsewhere, the White House reportedly expects a significant market pop with a significant China trade deal, with advisors reportedly saying that the Dow could pop 2,000 points on a deal announcement, according to Fox's Gasparino.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> GBP failed to sustain the no-deal driven rally yesterday and is set to close the day in the red. This comes as UK whips came back into power after yesterday’s lack of discipline, as the government got a much-needed win and passed their motion to seek an extension to Article 50 (assuming convincing justification) unamended. Whilst the fine margin of loss in amendment I saw marginal downside for cable, as the power of Brexit’s future path was not granted to the remain-leaning house, GBP completed the voting session in the green as the intent to seek an extension allows for more breathing room to negotiate and prepare for a new exit date. The cross maintains some downside risk, however, as questions remain about the length and possibility of an extension as it requires EU approval. The government’s stated intention is to look for a short, technical postponement (suggested to be June 30th) whilst the EU is looking for a longer one (21 months has been floated); as such EU rhetoric henceforth becomes much more pivotal, especially considering the suggested frustration from the EU side that PM May is holding a third vote on her deal on the eve of the EU summit.</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES: </strong>Fell unexpectedly in January, though upward revisions to the prior painted offset (cumulative revisions saw 63k added over the last three months). Sales declined by 6.9% MM to 607k, lowest since October 2018. Month's supply picked up to 6.6, the highest since October, while median home prices fell by 3.8% YY, a decent improvement from the -7% in December, and -10.7% in November. \"Overall, in spite of the weaker than expected sales in January upward revisions to Q4 2018 data and the improving trend in home prices paint a somewhat healthier picture of housing activity and a stabilization compared to the steady slowing trend during the first three quarters of 2018,\" Barclays said.</p><p><strong>* IMPORT/EXPORT PRICES: </strong>US <strong>import prices </strong>rose by 0.6% MM in February, a rebound from January’s 0.5% drop - which has now been revised to a 0.1% rise - and higher than the expected 0.3% rise. However, in a YY basis “import prices remained in deflationary territory for a third straight month, down 1.3% y/y in February. Softer global growth, a stronger dollar, and lower oil prices are now pressuring domestic inflation downward. However, with imports only comprising a sixth of GDP, the pass-through is small,” Oxford Economics’ (OE) analysts comment. Supporting the figure was the rebound in energy prices going into the year, however the non-fuel components were “unchanged” or “sluggish” in February. <strong>Export prices</strong> rose by 0.6% MM too, greater than the expected 0.1% rise, with the previous 0.6% drop being narrowed to 0.1%. OE adds, “prices for both agricultural (+0.3%) and non-agricultural exports (+0.7%) added support to the headline gain. From a year ago, export prices accelerated to 0.3% y/y after briefly slipping into deflationary territory, down 0.2% y/y in January.”</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW - BOJ: </strong>The Bank of Japan will conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Friday in which consensus is for the central bank to maintain NIRP at -0.10% and keep QQE with YCC unchanged in which it will purchase JGBs so that 10yr JGB yields remain around 0% with some flexibility. The BoJ is also expected to maintain forward guidance of keeping rates at current extremely low levels for an extended period of time considering the uncertainties related to the economy and prices including the impact from the scheduled sales tax hike later this year.

Demand side factors were again limiting the rally with China’s industrial output coming in softer than expected, yet again an ominous figure from the super-nation. Additionally, OPEC released its monthly report which sees total world oil demand growth in 2018 is at 1.43mln BPD, down by 40k BPD from the previous estimate amid downward revisions in both OECD and non-OECD regions. However, “OPEC production did decline 221k BPD to 30.549mln BPD during February according to the report, but this was largely in line with earlier estimates and so, market expectations,” Citigroup analysts note. The report showed that the OPEC members bound by the supply cut deal met 105% of the pledged reductions in February (in early March it was reported at 101%), which bulls will be glad to hear. Also weighing on commodity prices was a stronger dollar, in the midst of a more strained risk appetite after reports a Trump and Xi meeting wouldn’t happen till at least late April. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.09% at 2808, NDX -0.19% at 7243, DJI +0.03% at 25710. SECTORS: Energy +0.06%, Materials -0.80%, Industrials -0.35%, Cons Discretionary -0.31%, Cons Staples -0.28%, Healthcare -0.25%, Financials +0.41%, Tech +0.20%, Telecoms -0.40%, Utilities -0.14%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>General Electric (GE) opened higher today after CEO Larry Culp provided a promising outlook for the years ahead, despite 2019 being disappointing. Dollar General (DG) nosedived on the back of its earnings report which revealed a large amount of new stores to open will weigh on its bottom line. Apple (AAPL) caught a bid, helped by an “outperform” initiation at Cowen. TechnipFMC (FTI) was an outperformer whilst rumours floated it was the frontrunner for a contract from Equinor in Norway. Take-Two (TTWO) pares back Wednesday’s rally after Sony (SNE) denied speculation it was considering an acquisition. Bristol-Myers (BMY) underperformed on the back of a positive drug patent outcome for Celgene (CELG), which caused it to trade higher, making the merger deal more likely.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 5 TICKS LOWER AT 122-22+. </strong>Treasuries edged slightly lower on Thursday, with the T-plex ran into the session on a downward path where hedge funds were reported to be selling at the long-end, causing the curve to steepen. Although this was supported by CTAs covering their shorts just before the US equity open, with some block buyers in the front end, but this trend halted as Europeans began leaving their desks, keeping any price rallies limited. Going into the settlement, yields rose across the curve, long-end saw yields rose the most prolific with the 30-year up by c. 3.5bps. Spreads also widened further, where the 5s/30s at the greatest in 13 months and the 2s/30s greatest in 9 months.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The yen has remained quite resilient in the face of today's early risk-off, inspired by a weak batch of Chinese data overnight, that hit the 'risk-on' currencies, the AUD and NZD. Ahead of the BOJ's policy meeting, where the central bank is expected to dial up the dovishness, ING prefers playing the stronger USD story against the JPY. The bank notes that US data is now proving constructive, citing the durable goods report this week. Other factors remain supportive, with commodities firm, diminishing signs of a disorderly Brexit, and risk assets on the front-foot; the bank expects USDJPY to trade up to 112.20.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> GBP failed to sustain the no-deal driven rally yesterday and is set to close the day in the red. This comes as UK whips came back into power after yesterday’s lack of discipline, as the government got a much-needed win and passed their motion to seek an extension to Article 50 (assuming convincing justification) unamended. Whilst the fine margin of loss in amendment I saw marginal downside for cable, as the power of Brexit’s future path was not granted to the remain-leaning house, GBP completed the voting session in the green as the intent to seek an extension allows for more breathing room to negotiate and prepare for a new exit date.

AUD extended its reversal from almost 0.7100 at best to sub-0.7050 through a couple of MAs, while NZD inched closer towards 0.6800 before the Antipodean Dollars derived some traction from subsequent comments suggesting some elements of the US-China negotiations will be resolved sooner rather than later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>* JPY: The yen has remained quite resilient in the face of today's early risk-off, inspired by a weak batch of Chinese data overnight, that hit the 'risk-on' currencies, the AUD and NZD. Ahead of the BOJ's policy meeting, where the central bank is expected to dial up the dovishness, ING prefers playing the stronger USD story against the JPY. The bank notes that US data is now proving constructive, citing the durable goods report this week. Other factors remain supportive, with commodities firm, diminishing signs of a disorderly Brexit, and risk assets on the front-foot; the bank expects USDJPY to trade up to 112.20.</p><p>* GBP: GBP failed to sustain the no-deal driven rally yesterday and is set to close the day in the red. This comes as UK whips came back into power after yesterday’s lack of discipline, as the government got a much-needed win and passed their motion to seek an extension to Article 50 (assuming convincing justification) unamended. Whilst the fine margin of loss in amendment I saw marginal downside for cable, as the power of Brexit’s future path was not granted to the remain-leaning house, GBP completed the voting session in the green as the intent to seek an extension allows for more breathing room to negotiate and prepare for a new exit date. The cross maintains some downside risk, however, as questions remain about the length and possibility of an extension as it requires EU approval. The government’s stated intention is to look for a short, technical postponement (suggested to be June 30th) whilst the EU is looking for a longer one (21 months has been floated); as such EU rhetoric henceforth becomes much more pivotal, especially considering the suggested frustration from the EU side that PM May is holding a third vote on her deal on the eve of the EU summit.</p><p>* AUD, NZD: The Antipodes suffered mainly on risk-off sentiment in wake of disappointing Chinese IP data overnight that was compounded by reports of a delay for possibly another month at least for the meeting between Trump and Xi to formally seal a trade deal. AUD extended its reversal from almost 0.7100 at best to sub-0.7050 through a couple of MAs, while NZD inched closer towards 0.6800 before the Antipodean Dollars derived some traction from subsequent comments suggesting some elements of the US-China negotiations will be resolved sooner rather than later.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>After oil’s rally upward earlier in the week, Thursday’s session was somewhat choppy. Demand side factors were again limiting the rally with China’s industrial output coming in softer than expected, yet again an ominous figure from the super-nation. Additionally, OPEC released its monthly report which sees total world oil demand growth in 2018 is at 1.43mln BPD, down by 40k BPD from the previous estimate amid downward revisions in both OECD and non-OECD regions. However, “OPEC production did decline 221k BPD to 30.549mln BPD during February according to the report, but this was largely in line with earlier estimates and so, market expectations,” Citigroup analysts note. The report showed that the OPEC members bound by the supply cut deal met 105% of the pledged reductions in February (in early March it was reported at 101%), which bulls will be glad to hear. Also weighing on commodity prices was a stronger dollar, in the midst of a more strained risk appetite after reports a Trump and Xi meeting wouldn’t happen till at least late April.&nbsp;</p>",

It is likely that EU members would vote to approve any extension at next week's summit (29 March). A memo reportedly says EU is to advise that extending Article 50 only makes sense in 3 scenarios: 1) to prepare for no deal, 2) complete ratification of a deal, or 3) if the UK decides to hold an election or referendum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?/or beyond?</strong></p><ul><li>House Speaker Bercow proposed an Article 50 extension <strong>until June 30th</strong></li><li>Shadow Chancellor McDonnell noted that the Labour party will back a <strong>limited Brexit delay</strong></li><li>Chancellor Hammond highlighted that it is <strong>possible for the EU to ask for a longer extension period</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EU SIDE</strong></p><ul><li>Reports earlier in the week noted that the<strong> EU are readying for a Brexit delay of up to one year</strong></li><li>European Council President Tusk said he will <strong>appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink Brexit strategy</strong> and build consensus around it</li><li>Reports stated that Germany and Austria are <strong>opposed to</strong> <strong>extend Article 50</strong> <strong>beyond the EU elections (May 23rd)</strong></li><li>French President Marcon is reportedly keen to extend <strong>Article 50 by up to 21 months.</strong></li><li>Portuguese Foreign Ministry is ready to support <strong>a long Article 50 extension</strong> to find a solution, and added <strong>that it needs to be longer than some weeks</strong></li><li>Italy's Foreign Minister said Italy should vote in favour of an Article 50 extension</li><li>Reports state that <strong>the EU are angry that PM May is holding a third vote on her deal on the eve of the EU summit</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* AMENDMENTS SELECTED FOR TODAY’S VOTE</strong></p><p><strong>(E) LABOUR</strong>: Instruct PM May to seek an Article 50 extension to avoid leaving the EU on 29th March without a deal and to provide parliamentary time for the HoC to find a majority for a different approach.</p><p><strong>(H) WOLLASTON-WHITFORD-CHERRY-BRAKE: Instruct</strong> PM May to request an extension of Article 50 of sufficient length for a referendum to be legislated for and held with options for leaving on terms determined by parliament or staying in the EU.

The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to 18 April – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to 23 May has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit becomes possible. A push to the end of June – 23rd is capturing imaginations since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in early July, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that will not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.</p>",

Cable continued its retreat from 1.3300+ highs after falling just short of 1.3400, and almost hit 1.3200 before stabilising again. Note, the MPs have started debating amendments before the voting kicks off around 17.00GMT and the main motion is tabled, but for a more detailed primer and analysis please consult our headline feed.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The next major currency losers, mainly on risk-off sentiment in wake of disappointing Chinese IP data overnight that was compounded by reports of a delay for possibly another month at least for the meeting between Trump and Xi to formally seal a trade deal. Aud/Usd extended its reversal from almost 0.7100 at best to sub-0.7050 through a couple of MAs, while Nzd/Usd inched closer towards 0.6800 before the Antipodean Dollars derived some traction from subsequent comments suggesting some elements of the US-China negotiations will be resolved sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Although off worst levels within a 111.73-14 range vs the Dollar, the Jpy remains below the 200 DMA (111.43) and cautious ahead of the looming BoJ policy meeting that could culminate in a more downbeat economic assessment/outlook and cement recent dovish rhetoric via revised guidance.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Volatile trade for the Greenback and index between 96.483-821 parameters amidst fluctuating US-China headlines via the President and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, choppy moves elsewhere and eyeing several technical levels. The DXY is currently just over 96.700, with support via the 30 DMA (96.602) nearby, but not a lot in terms of resistance before 97.000.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>Also on the back foot vs the Buck having lost momentum and conceded ground to the recovering Usd, with the single currency clinging on to the 1.1300 handle following a foray below in wake of another marked downgrade to German growth this year (Ifo almost halving its GDP estimate to 0.6%), and the aforementioned less constructive Washington-Beijing updates. The Loonie got to within a whisker of resistance at the 100 DMA (1.3281) before recoiling back below 1.3300 as the oil rebound stalled and Canadian house prices slipped in January.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc looks set to end the EU session as the G10 outperformer or most resilient as Usd/Chf remains confined to a tight 1.0050-30 range after less deflationary Swiss data in the form of producer/import prices.</p>",

While this has been seen as a potential outcome for a while markets were still taken by surprise hence the significant drop from session high. Sectors have strengthened throughout the session to all being firmly in the green, after a somewhat mixed start to the session for sectors; with IT names the initial notable laggard. Notable movers include K+S Group (+7.3%) at the top of the Stoxx 600 after their FY18 EBITDA beat on expectations, alongside the Co. presenting strong EBITDA guidance for 2019. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Lufthansa (-5.3%) after the Co. cut its growth plans as higher fuel costs weighed on earnings. Elsewhere, RWE (+0.3%) shares have been volatile since opening lower by around 2% after the Co. posted earnings below expectations, the turnaround in shares may be due to the Co. stating that they are confident the timetable for a E.ON (-0.1%) deal can be adhered to, after highlighting a potential delay to it in the event of a hard Brexit.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - Some respite for the Dollar and index after Wednesday’s relatively sharp sell-off, as the steeper reversal from recent 97.000+ highs stopped at the 96.371 level that coincides with technical support on some charts. However, the rebound was at least partly if not mainly due to external factors with several major counterparts undermined bearish impulses or running out of bullish momentum in the case of Sterling. The DXY is just shy of a recovery high inches above 96.750, and the 30 DMA at 96.602 could be key in terms of a firmer rebound or fade before another leg down towards the next downside technical level ahead of 96.000, which comes in at 96.283.</p><p>AUD/NZD/GBP/JPY - It’s a 4-horse race to avoid being last G10 currency to Thursday’s (EU session) finishing post, as the Aussie is undermined by data again, albeit Chinese this time rather than domestic, and fresh reports about a delay to the eagerly awaited Trump-Xi Summit to sign off a trade pact. Aud/Usd has slipped back further from near 0.7100 at one stage to 0.7050 and the Kiwi in sympathy with Nzd/Usd now around 0.6817 vs 0.6865 at best. Meanwhile, the Pound has pulled back following another Brexit-related spurt that catapulted Cable to circa 1.3340 before a retreat through 1.3300 to 1.3250. Sterling got an extra boost from the 2nd UK Parliamentary vote this week that saw a no deal in any guise rejected by MPs, in principle at least. Attention now turns to an extension of the March 29 Article deadline, and the strong prospect of that being approved has prompted PM May to tentatively schedule a 3rd MV sometime before next week’s EU Summit. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has backed off from circa 111.73 overnight peaks on the aforementioned breaking US-China news, but the headline pair remains above a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (111.43) and could be prone to further upside if the BoJ is as dovish as expected tomorrow, or even more. Note, for a full preview of the impending policy meeting please refer to the Ransquawk Research Suite.</p><p>CHF/EUR/CAD - All holding up better against the Buck revival, as the Franc hovers close to the top of a 1.0050-30 range and perhaps finds some traction from firmer than forecast Swiss import/producer prices (albeit still deflationary in y/y terms). Meanwhile, the single currency is keeping its head above 1.1300, marginally, but shy of Fib resistance (1.1327 represents a 38.2% retracement of this year’s 1.1570-1.1177 move) after another hefty 2019 German GDP forecast downgrade (0.6% from 1.1% per Ifo) and the Loonie is back below 1.3300 vs its US rival against the backdrop of toppy oil prices and ahead of Canadian house price data then a speech from BoC’s Wilkins.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>No further, or at least not much more follow-through selling at the lows in core debt prefaced a period of consolidation, and the less positive headlines about no meeting between US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart this month also sparked a mild safe-haven bid that lifted Bunds to a marginal new Eurex session high of 164.40 (-7 ticks vs -36 ticks at worst). Meanwhile, Gilts still lag but are back near the top of the range and US Treasuries ditto. Ahead, weekly claims and import/export prices ahead of housing data plus a testimony from Mnuchin and the last of this week’s UK Parliament Brexit votes (but far from the final chapter in the long-running saga as an extension appears likely, not to mention a 3rd MV possibly next Wednesday).</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.1%) futures have slipped following reports that a Trump-Xi summit may be delayed until April vs. prior expectations of an end-March summit. As such WTI and Brent futures fell back into their respective one-month long range of around USD 3.50/bbl. This summit push-back has however been touted for a while as USTR Lighthizer recently noted that sticking points remain in talks. Elsewhere, Iraqi Energy Minister emerged on the wires stating that the nation will decrease crude exports to average 3.5mln BPD from USD 3.62mln BPD in order to comply with OPEC’s output curbs. As a heads up, OPEC’s monthly oil report will be published today at 1200GMT/0800EDT. The metals market is largely on the backfoot amid a pick-up in the USD wherein the yellow metal breached USD 1300/oz to the downside. Gold is now back below its 50 DMA at 1303/oz ahead of its 100 DMA at 1271/oz. Elsewhere, copper erased its three-day gains amidst a firmer Buck couple with a turnaround in risk sentiment after the Trump-Xi meeting.</p><p><strong>US is seeking to reduce Iran oil sales by about 20% to below 1mln bpd from May and is likely to renew sanctions waivers to Iranian oil buyers but could deny waivers to countries not using them, according to sources</strong>.

While this has been seen as a potential outcome for a while markets were still taken by surprise hence the significant drop from session high. Sectors have strengthened throughout the session to all being firmly in the green, after a somewhat mixed start to the session for sectors; with IT names the initial notable laggard. Notable movers include K+S Group (+7.3%) at the top of the Stoxx 600 after their FY18 EBITDA beat on expectations, alongside the Co. presenting strong EBITDA guidance for 2019. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Lufthansa (-5.3%) after the Co. cut its growth plans as higher fuel costs weighed on earnings. Elsewhere, RWE (+0.3%) shares have been volatile since opening lower by around 2% after the Co. posted earnings below expectations, the turnaround in shares may be due to the Co. stating that they are confident the timetable for a E.ON (-0.1%) deal can be adhered to, after highlighting a potential delay to it in the event of a hard Brexit.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>DXY - Some respite for the Dollar and index after Wednesday’s relatively sharp sell-off, as the steeper reversal from recent 97.000+ highs stopped at the 96.371 level that coincides with technical support on some charts. However, the rebound was at least partly if not mainly due to external factors with several major counterparts undermined bearish impulses or running out of bullish momentum in the case of Sterling. The DXY is just shy of a recovery high inches above 96.750, and the 30 DMA at 96.602 could be key in terms of a firmer rebound or fade before another leg down towards the next downside technical level ahead of 96.000, which comes in at 96.283.</p><p>AUD/NZD/GBP/JPY - It’s a 4-horse race to avoid being last G10 currency to Thursday’s (EU session) finishing post, as the Aussie is undermined by data again, albeit Chinese this time rather than domestic, and fresh reports about a delay to the eagerly awaited Trump-Xi Summit to sign off a trade pact. Aud/Usd has slipped back further from near 0.7100 at one stage to 0.7050 and the Kiwi in sympathy with Nzd/Usd now around 0.6817 vs 0.6865 at best. Meanwhile, the Pound has pulled back following another Brexit-related spurt that catapulted Cable to circa 1.3340 before a retreat through 1.3300 to 1.3250. Sterling got an extra boost from the 2nd UK Parliamentary vote this week that saw a no deal in any guise rejected by MPs, in principle at least. Attention now turns to an extension of the March 29 Article deadline, and the strong prospect of that being approved has prompted PM May to tentatively schedule a 3rd MV sometime before next week’s EU Summit. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has backed off from circa 111.73 overnight peaks on the aforementioned breaking US-China news, but the headline pair remains above a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (111.43) and could be prone to further upside if the BoJ is as dovish as expected tomorrow, or even more. Note, for a full preview of the impending policy meeting please refer to the Ransquawk Research Suite.</p><p>CHF/EUR/CAD - All holding up better against the Buck revival, as the Franc hovers close to the top of a 1.0050-30 range and perhaps finds some traction from firmer than forecast Swiss import/producer prices (albeit still deflationary in y/y terms). Meanwhile, the single currency is keeping its head above 1.1300, marginally, but shy of Fib resistance (1.1327 represents a 38.2% retracement of this year’s 1.1570-1.1177 move) after another hefty 2019 German GDP forecast downgrade (0.6% from 1.1% per Ifo) and the Loonie is back below 1.3300 vs its US rival against the backdrop of toppy oil prices and ahead of Canadian house price data then a speech from BoC’s Wilkins.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>No further, or at least not much more follow-through selling at the lows in core debt prefaced a period of consolidation, and the less positive headlines about no meeting between US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart this month also sparked a mild safe-haven bid that lifted Bunds to a marginal new Eurex session high of 164.40 (-7 ticks vs -36 ticks at worst). Meanwhile, Gilts still lag but are back near the top of the range and US Treasuries ditto. Ahead, weekly claims and import/export prices ahead of housing data plus a testimony from Mnuchin and the last of this week’s UK Parliament Brexit votes (but far from the final chapter in the long-running saga as an extension appears likely, not to mention a 3rd MV possibly next Wednesday).</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.1%) futures have slipped following reports that a Trump-Xi summit may be delayed until April vs. prior expectations of an end-March summit. As such WTI and Brent futures fell back into their respective one-month long range of around USD 3.50/bbl. This summit push-back has however been touted for a while as USTR Lighthizer recently noted that sticking points remain in talks. Elsewhere, Iraqi Energy Minister emerged on the wires stating that the nation will decrease crude exports to average 3.5mln BPD from USD 3.62mln BPD in order to comply with OPEC’s output curbs. As a heads up, OPEC’s monthly oil report will be published today at 1200GMT/0800EDT. The metals market is largely on the backfoot amid a pick-up in the USD wherein the yellow metal breached USD 1300/oz to the downside. Gold is now back below its 50 DMA at 1303/oz ahead of its 100 DMA at 1271/oz. Elsewhere, copper erased its three-day gains amidst a firmer Buck couple with a turnaround in risk sentiment after the Trump-Xi meeting.</p>",

The DXY is just shy of a recovery high inches above 96.750, and the 30 DMA at 96.602 could be key in terms of a firmer rebound or fade before another leg down towards the next downside technical level ahead of 96.000, which comes in at 96.283.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>It’s a 4-horse race to avoid being last G10 currency to Thursday’s (EU session) finishing post, as the Aussie is undermined by data again, albeit Chinese this time rather than domestic, and fresh reports about a delay to the eagerly awaited Trump-Xi Summit to sign off a trade pact. Aud/Usd has slipped back further from near 0.7100 at one stage to 0.7050 and the Kiwi in sympathy with Nzd/Usd now around 0.6817 vs 0.6865 at best. Meanwhile, the Pound has pulled back following another Brexit-related spurt that catapulted Cable to circa 1.3340 before a retreat through 1.3300 to 1.3250. Sterling got an extra boost from the 2nd UK Parliamentary vote this week that saw a no deal in any guise rejected by MPs, in principle at least. Attention now turns to an extension of the March 29 Article deadline, and the strong prospect of that being approved has prompted PM May to tentatively schedule a 3rd MV sometime before next week’s EU Summit. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has backed off from circa 111.73 overnight peaks on the aforementioned breaking US-China news, but the headline pair remains above a key chart level in the form of the 200 DMA (111.43) and could be prone to further upside if the BoJ is as dovish as expected tomorrow, or even more. Note, for a full preview of the impending policy meeting please refer to the Ransquawk Research Suite.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All holding up better against the Buck revival, as the Franc hovers close to the top of a 1.0050-30 range and perhaps finds some traction from firmer than forecast Swiss import/producer prices (albeit still deflationary in y/y terms). Meanwhile, the single currency is keeping its head above 1.1300, marginally, but shy of Fib resistance (1.1327 represents a 38.2% retracement of this year’s 1.1570-1.1177 move) after another hefty 2019 German GDP forecast downgrade (0.6% from 1.1% per Ifo) and the Loonie is back below 1.3300 vs its US rival against the backdrop of toppy oil prices and ahead of Canadian house price data then a speech from BoC’s Wilkins.</p>",

The softer tone chimes with price action in US Treasuries following a rather sluggish finale to this week’s supply as the 30 year sale tailed and failed to muster strong demand with yields at multi-month lows just above 3%. This has prompted a bit more steepening along the curve, and resurgent oil prices may also be a bearish factor at present. Back to Bunds, nearest tech levels outside the current range come in at 164.47 and 163.92, while the corresponding yield looks flanked between 0.5-0.1% awaiting clearer fundamental direction.</p>",

PM May further commented that the options remain the same in which we could have a second referendum but that would risk no Brexit at all and that the EU has been clear this is the only deal available, while she added that without getting a consensus on a deal in the coming days there will need to be a longer extension which would require the UK to take part in EU elections.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are mostly higher with the region taking impetus from the US where sentiment was underpinned by mixed data as Durable Goods topped estimates and PPI figures added to the soft inflation narrative as well as the case for Fed patience. This saw all US major indices finish positive with the S&amp;P 500 at a 4-month high and in turn spurred the momentum in Asia, although this was slightly clouded as participants digested mixed China data releases. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) both gained at the open with energy outperforming in Australia after oil prices hit their best levels since November, while SoftBank shares are among the top gainers in the Japanese benchmark after reports it is in discussions regarding a USD 1bln investment into Uber’s self-driving unit. Chinese markets are mixed with the Hang Seng (+0.1%) kept afloat by notable strength seen in China’s oil majors and with China Unicom rallying post-earnings, although Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) underperforms and briefly dipped below the 3000 level after mixed data in which Industrial Production fell to a 17-year low and Retail Sales printed inline with expectations.</p><p>FX focus was once again on GBP which rallied by around 2% to a 9-month high on Wednesday after Parliament voted for the UK Government Brexit motion which calls on the Government to rule out a no-deal in any scenario. However, GBP/USD has significantly pulled back overnight to below 1.3300 as uncertainty remains considering that motions are not legally binding and that a no-deal remains the legal default position. PM May is also said to be preparing a potential 3rd meaningful vote and warned Tory rebels to back her deal by next week or risk a long extension to Article 50, which some in the ERG intend to do so only on the condition she resigns, while the currency is also poised for another tumultuous day with Parliament next to vote on the motion to extend Article 50. Elsewhere, the DXY has consolidated to provide some much-needed respite from yesterday’s slip from the 97.00 level and its 4th consecutive loss, while its major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD holding on to the prior day’s gains and with antipodeans lacklustre on the China data. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses remain underpinned as the mostly positive risk appetite spurs outflows from safe haven JPY and with long-term yields in Japan declining in which both 20yr and 30yr JGB yields fell to the lowest since November 2016.&nbsp;</p>",
