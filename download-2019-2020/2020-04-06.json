However, any strengthening of risk appetite warrants caution at this stage as the economy is far from “out of the woods,” analysts have said. Delta Airlines (DAL) CEO expects Q2 revenue to be down 90% with Q2 faring worse than Q1 and noted April capacity will be 80% smaller than initially planned. United Airlines (UAL) announced it cut roughly 80% of its capacity for April and expects load factors to fall into the teens or single digits while expecting even larger capacity reductions in May. It also estimates a USD 100mln revenue loss per day in March Y/Y, while expecting revenue to fall at least 30% in Q4 Y/Y. Both UAL and American Airlines (AAL) are reducing flights to the New York City area. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is reportedly evaluating all sources of capital and seeking talks regarding aid over the upcoming days. JetBlue (JBLU) announced it is burning through USD 10mln per day and announced it is to park 100 airplanes and cut its April flight schedule by at least 70% due to the fall in demand. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffet announced he sold 2.3mln shares of LUV and 12.9mln of DAL. Boeing (BA) announced it has extended its temporary suspension of its Puget Sound and Moses Lake factories for the foreseeable future. Alphabet (GOOG) deal with Fitbit (FIT) has gathered increased scrutiny from the DoJ, which is now conducting a second request review asking for further information to analyse the deal, according to NY Post. Facebook (FB) is reportedly getting a major redesign, according to Business Insider. Kraft Heinz (KHC) noted it has halted production at three of its plants but increased shifts at others to help meet the high demand. Woodward (WWD) and Hexcel (HXL) announced the two have mutually decided to end its merger agreement where the two agreed to combine in an all-stock merger of equals. Wayfair (W) announced it expects to meet or exceed its Q120 guidance. SPX +6.95% at 2661, NDX +7.35% at 8082, DJIA +7.7% at 22,680.</p><p>The TPLEX bear-steepened alongside a strong equity rally and heavy issuance. The T-Note had been firming off of lows in early European trade amid tentative equity gains, although pared strength as the US session commenced and the equity rally gained momentum, on both sides of the pond. However, the curve steepening was tamed somewhat as investors anticipated the upsized USD 40bln 3-year Treasury issuance, which tailed by a chunky 1.2bps, covered&nbsp; 2.27x (less than the six-auction average of 2.47x), and saw dealers take 40.54% (more than the average 35.3%).&nbsp; Furthermore, the Fed’s support for Treasuries has pared further on Monday, and for the rest of the week, as it trimmed its daily purchases amount to USD 50bln per week, which also saw participants sell into the operations. All the while, corporate issuance started the week again on a strong note, seeing eleven IG issuers come to the dollar market and a small handful of SSAs (particularly Canadians), likely adding to the selling pressures. By settlement, 2s +5bps at 0.266%, 10s +8bps at 0.671%. T-note (M0) futures settled 23+ ticks lower at 138-13.</p>",

However, any strengthening of risk appetite warrants caution at this stage as the economy is far from “out of the woods,” analysts have said. The configuration of sectors was mixed, with the defensive utilities gaining, while staples was at the bottom of the pack; tech was among the better performers with materials, and even energy managed to book gains. Some analysts are now casting their attention beyond stimulus announcements. Goldman Sachs said we are now moving into a data-dependent phase, and in this phase, investors will be challenged to react to information from and about three sources, including: the virus, corporate earnings, and macroeconomic indicators. The bank notes last week's macro data did not have much impact, but today's positive reaction to COVID-19 case counts and death tolls highlights how investors are perhaps likely to first focus on the virus data before turning to the corporate and economic data as we slowly transition through this next phase for markets. The bank also suggests traders will pay attention on updates from pharmas in finding a vaccine. Elsewhere, comments from JPMorgan chief Dimon received attention, and in his annual letter to shareholders, he said that the bank was assuming a bad recession is coming combined with some sort of financial stress similar to the GFC in 2008. Meanwhile, in the near-term, UBS highlighted several key risk measures moving lower last week: the UST 10-year fell back to 60bps while TYVIX is down to 6.1 and below 10 for nine straight days, sees TYVIX settling into a 6-8 range as positive for risk assets; both gold and yen VIXs also fell by approximately 2 points W/W as safe havens continue to stabilise – this, the bank said, was supportive for risk assets.</p><h2>CASE COUNT</h2><p><strong>WORLDWIDE CASES, DEATHS, RECOVERED.</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Monday (via worldometer website) against Friday:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>US </strong>total cases 356,563 (prev. 266,279), death toll 10,516 (prev. 6,803).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 132,547 (prev. 119,827), death toll 16,523 (prev. 14,681).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 135,032 (prev. 117,710), death toll 13,169 (prev. 10,935).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 101,779 (prev. 89,838), death toll 1664 (prev. 1,230).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 81,708 (prev. 81,620), death toll 3,331 (prev. 3,322).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 98,010 (prev. 64,338), death toll 8,911 (prev. 6,507).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK </strong>total cases 51,608 (prev. 38,168), death toll 5373 (prev. 3,605).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>total cases 21,652 (prev. 19,606), death toll 762 (prev. 591).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 18,803 (prev. 15,723), death toll 1,867 (prev. 1,487).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 16,498 (prev. 12,375), death toll 321 (prev. 178).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 10,284 (prev. 10,062), death toll 186 (prev. 174).</p><p><i>Note figures are provided via </i><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\"><i>worldometer</i></a><i> thus there may be some discrepancies on figures provided against those stated from individual states.</i></p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>US President Trump said he likes the concept of sending additional economic relief checks to Americans. Meanwhile, Politico reported that Senate Minority Leader Schumer has spoken to WH Chief of Staff Meadows to have the President entirely invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA); Schumer has talked to Trump, Pence and Meadows previously, but this is the first time he has provided the Chief of Staff with the list of names.</p><p><strong>NY CASES: </strong>NY Governor Cuomo suggested we are seeing a possible flattening of the curve, and a separate official suggested we are potentially at the apex or the start of it. On the weekend, President Trump said there is going to be a lot of deaths in the next two weeks, but he also expressed hopes that we’re seeing a levelling-off in some key hottest spots, and that the drop in the number of New York deaths could be a good sign. Trump added that the US was very far down the line on developing vaccines while suggesting that we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>The<strong> </strong>Federal Reserve and US Treasury are reportedly preparing to launch a new programme to buy loans that firms make throughout their small business lending programme, according to WSJ sources. The move would form a secondary market for loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration’s Payroll Protection Programme. Meanwhile, the<strong> </strong>NY Fed’s repo operations saw minimal take up again, while the RRP operation saw continued strong demand.</p><p><strong>BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey was deemed rather stale given the majority of interviews were conducted before coronavirus concerns intensified, although it still showed that confidence had slipped even before the COVID-19 shock. The BOC stated that more recent consultations indicated sales have collapsed for businesses in consumer-oriented industries and energy firms have experienced a dramatic increase in economic and financial stress, and believe the current shock is worse than that seen in 2008 and 2015. Canadian bank RBC highlights that the survey on the oil and gas industry showed the need for policymakers to provide more support to the industry, where many were forced to cut costs and operations, while some thought it could weather a period of low oil prices many were worried about access to financing as equity prices collapse, credit spreads widen and risk sentiment deteriorates. Although, the survey was conducted between February 11 to March 6th, so the large stimulus packages from Canada and the Government in the end of March would not be encapsulated.</p><p><strong>RBA:</strong> The RBA is to announce its latest policy decision on Tuesday in which there are mixed expectations with analysts anticipating the RBA to likely keep rates on hold after its recent unprecedented action, although ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures would suggest a near coin-flip, pricing in a 55% likelihood of a 25bps cut and 45% chance for rates to be maintained at 0.25%.

Sides have recently failed to reach a consensus on a bloc-wide response, with many Southern nations calling for joint bond issuance to finance any response, which had met opposition from Northern members. However, although ‘Coronabonds’ are seemingly a non-starter, for now, the group may strike a deal on using the ESM bailout fund to extend credit lines with flexible conditions. Recent press reports have suggested that a three-pronged proposal is being discussed, consisting of healthcare funding via the ESM of up to EUR 200bln, EIB credit guarantees worth EUR 200-240bln, and an EU-wide short-shift or partial unemployment scheme from the EC worth EUR 100bln. Deutsche Bank said that a package of this size would be an impressive 4.5% of GDP, and circumvents the need for Coronabonds at this stage. “The details will matter and the three elements are only temporary,” DB writes, “as the risk of a protracted pandemic rises, so too does the need to follow up this plan with a centralised demand stimulus package, for example, a large-scale EIB investment programme. So a big meeting to watch.”</p><p><strong>GERMAN LOCKDOWN: </strong>A German Government Spokesperson said it would not name a date for the end of COVID-19 restrictions. However, a Euronews reporter later suggested that, after a relatively low death rate, Germany has drawn up plans to relax the lockdown after April 19th, although measures will still include mandatory mask-wearing in public, limits on gatherings and the rapid tracing of infection chains, to help enable a phased return to normal life.</p><p><strong>UK: </strong>UK PM Johnson was taken to hospital on Sunday for tests due to the coronavirus, which Downing Street stated was a precautionary step, as the PM had persistent symptoms ten days after having tested positive. However, in late trade Johnson was taken to intensive care as his condition was said to have worsened throughout the afternoon. Johnson reportedly had asked Foreign Secretary Raab to deputise for him. Meanwhile, UK Ministers have begun talks on how and when lockdown rules could be eased amid concerns in the Treasury over the long-term implications of the measures. One option could involve easing by region, industrial sector or expanding the release of “key workers”, the Times reported. A separate Times report noted that whilst the lockdown is in force it will cost the UK economy GBP 2.4bln per day. However, over the weekend, Health Secretary Hancock warned that lockdown measures could be tightened if they are required to halt the spread of COVID-19, although PM Johnson’s spokesperson on Monday said there are no plans to ban exercise.</p><p><strong>JAPAN: </strong>Japan<strong> </strong>PM Abe announced a JPY 108tln stimulus package, which includes more than JPY 6tln for pay-outs to households and small businesses. Abe also said that he wants to issue a declaration of emergency; details would be announced on Tuesday. NHK reported that Abe was to designate Tokyo and six other prefectures for a state of emergency declaration lasting around one month (earlier reports had suggested around six months).</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLES USD 2.26 LOWER AT USD 26.08/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 1.06 LOWER AT USD 33.05/BBL.</strong></p><p>Crude was lower on Monday, opening the futures session with losses exceeding 10%; those losses pared over the course of the session, amid a constructive risk environment. However, in choppy pre-settlement trade, the complex once again endured negative ticks, with WTI ultimately settling USD 2.26 down on the day, and Brent faring slightly better with losses of USD 1.06. The driving force behind today’s action was OPEC+ postponing its tentative meeting, originally scheduled for Monday, to Thursday, with the Saudis and Russians played the blame game over whose fault it was that the OPEC+ deal collapsed (although officially, it was to allow time for negotiations between stakeholders over the level of production cuts). On Monday sources also noted that a lack of US commitment is complicating talks; that said, the CEO of RDIF Dmitriev noted that Moscow and Riyadh are said to be “very, very close” to a deal on oil production cuts, while sources suggested Russia is ready to discuss “very substantial” output cuts, adding that the 10mln BPD cut figure might not be enough. Meanwhile, US President Trump on the weekend said he was considering slapping tariffs on oil imports, or even take other such measures, to protect the US energy sector from falling oil prices; Canada is reportedly considering similar measures; following calls by leading lawmakers in recent weeks for such action. For reference, the US’ imports of petroleum were around 9.1mln BPD in 2019, of which Saudi and Russian imports measured just over 500k each. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Oil Ministry stated it was invited to the OPEC+ meeting on April 9th, and would consider partaking as an observer if there was broad participation; added there are no ongoing talks with oil companies on cuts. Amid storage facilities reaching capacity, US Energy Secretary Brouillette said Trump had instructed him to look for additional oil storage capacity in the US, including commercial; said all options are on the table regarding tariffs on imports of foreign oil. Brouillette also said a G20 energy ministers meeting is possible by the end of the week. On a similar vein, sources reported Saudi Arabia and other producers are reportedly looking to convince others storage is running out.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 23+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-13.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX bear-steepened alongside a strong equity rally and heavy issuance. The T-Note had been firming off of lows in early European trade amid tentative equity gains, although pared strength as the US session commenced and the equity rally gained momentum, on both sides of the pond. However, the curve steepening was tamed somewhat as investors anticipated the upsized USD 40bln 3-year Treasury issuance, which tailed by a chunky 1.2bps, covered&nbsp; 2.27x (less than the six-auction average of 2.47x), and saw dealers take 40.54% (more than the average 35.3%).&nbsp; Furthermore, the Fed’s support for Treasuries has pared further on Monday, and for the rest of the week, as it trimmed its daily purchases amount to USD 50bln per week, which also saw participants sell into the operations. All the while, corporate issuance started the week again on a strong note, seeing eleven IG issuers come to the dollar market and a small handful of SSAs (particularly Canadians), likely adding to the selling pressures. By settlement, 2s +5bps at 0.266%, 10s +8bps at 0.671%.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>GERMANY INDUSTRIAL ORDERS:</strong> Slightly better than expected at -1.4% M/M; the data suggests that the international dimension of the COVID-19 impact on the German industry was relatively mild in February, ING said, but said that although this assessment is a bit outdated, it shows that the first wave of the COVID-19 impact on German industry has been rather benign. However, ING warned that as COVID-19 affects the economy through multiple channels, Monday’s industrial orders data look to be just another eerie calm before the storm.</p><p><strong>UK GFK CONSUMER CONFIDENCE:</strong> A flash report carried out by GFK in March showed UK consumer confidence saw the largest contraction in 45 years as COVID-19 began spreading. The index fell to -34 against the regular March survey’s -9, falling to the lowest since 2009. GFK said the data was a dramatic result with consumer confidence “falling off the cliff in the last two weeks of March.”</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +6.95% at 2661, NDX +7.35% at 8082, DJIA +7.7% at 22,680.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Technology +8.8%, Utilities +7.85%, Consumer Discretionary +7.75%, Materials +7.6%, Financials +7.5%, Real Estate +7.2%, Industrials +7%, Communication Services +6.7%, Health Care +5.4%, Energy +5.2%, Consumer Staples +3.9%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Delta Airlines (DAL) CEO expects Q2 revenue to be down 90% with Q2 faring worse than Q1 and noted April capacity will be 80% smaller than initially planned. United Airlines (UAL) announced it cut roughly 80% of its capacity for April and expects load factors to fall into the teens or single digits while expecting even larger capacity reductions in May. It also estimates a USD 100mln revenue loss per day in March Y/Y, while expecting revenue to fall at least 30% in Q4 Y/Y. Both UAL and American Airlines (AAL) are reducing flights to the New York City area. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is reportedly evaluating all sources of capital and seeking talks regarding aid over the upcoming days. JetBlue (JBLU) announced it is burning through USD 10mln per day and announced it is to park 100 airplanes and cut its April flight schedule by at least 70% due to the fall in demand. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffet announced he sold 2.3mln shares of LUV and 12.9mln of DAL. Boeing (BA) announced it has extended its temporary suspension of its Puget Sound and Moses Lake factories for the foreseeable future. Alphabet (GOOG) deal with Fitbit (FIT) has gathered increased scrutiny from the DoJ, which is now conducting a second request review asking for further information to analyse the deal, according to NY Post. Facebook (FB) is reportedly getting a major redesign, according to Business Insider. Kraft Heinz (KHC) noted it has halted production at three of its plants but increased shifts at others to help meet the high demand. Woodward (WWD) and Hexcel (HXL) announced the two have mutually decided to end its merger agreement where the two agreed to combine in an all-stock merger of equals. Wayfair (W) announced it expects to meet or exceed its Q120 guidance.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p>Risk-sensitive FX has been supported by data signalling a potential plateau of cases in key regions, while US President Trump also expressed hopes of stabilisation in key hotspots. Trump on the weekend said \"we are seeing things happen [in the data] which are very good\" - remarks which followed the prior weekend's comments where he said \"the country faces a very, very deadly period\" over the coming fortnight. Trump also added to expectations of more fiscal stimulus, including a second round of cheques for Americans.</p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The Dollar Index has struggled to deviate too much from the neutral line. There is increasing attention on the buck from non-FX traders these days; the dollar will often strengthen during risk-off episodes, due to the USD's role as the world reserve currency, and reserve re-balancing; outflows out of EM (and into USD); unhedged foreign buying of Treasuries; FX-hedged international equity investors reducing over-hedges as US stocks fall. GS says that for these reasons, it is expecting USD to remain firm as long as risky assets remain weak. \"If the S&amp;P 500 makes new lows, consistent with our cross-asset views, the broad dollar will probably make new highs”. DXY remains above 100 although did weaken slightly today amid improved risk sentiment which saw EMFX rally</p><p><strong>NOK:</strong> Recent spike in EURNOK has been correcting over the last fortnight; the NOK was hit by oil prices crashing and global risk-aversion amid COVID-19, but calmer markets are allowing the NOK to rise, with some analysts suggesting that the recent plunge was overdone from a cyclical/fair value perspective. The Norges Bank has also increased daily sales of foreign exchange to an equivalent of NOK 2bln (vs NOK 0.5bln before the COVID-19 fallout).</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> A more constructive risk backdrop has seen JPY weakened, launching USDJPY above 109.00, rising as high as 109.37, but finds the air thin around the key technical zone between 109.20-30, technicians said. PM Abe stated he'd be declaring a National Emergency on Tuesday and will deliver remarks to the public explaining the strategy; he also announced a stimulus package valued at JPY 108trln, Citi thinks the declaration would probably have little direct impact on markets, including the yen. Others note that while USD funding pressures have eased, seeing JPY basis normalise to levels seen at the beginning of March (extend the other way!), the yen itself remains a touch stronger against the USD (around 108.50 vs around 109.50 at the start of March). Technicians eye the 109.20-30 region as the key battleground in the near-term, which would open a move to 110.00-10; on the downside, technicians are watching the 108.75-80 region, and then 108.10-20 below that.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency had a relatively uneventful today ahead of the key Eurogroup meeting on Tuesday; EURUSD was lingering around 1.08. ING highlights that current FX implied volatility levels remain elevated although realised volatility is starting to drift lower, adding that some sense of calm may be returning to FX markets. The Bank notes EURUSD held support at 1.0770 and it is looking for a drift higher throughout the week. On the coronavirus, some reports stated that parts of Europe are starting to draw plans which would see some easing of the restrictions after a relatively low death rate in Germany.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The Aussie was one of the top performers in G10FX started the week on the attack, amid encouraging global data on COVID-19. The RBA will overnight announce its latest policy decision. There are mixed expectations, with analysts anticipating the RBA to likely keep rates on hold after its recent unprecedented action, although ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures would suggest a near coin-flip. The focus will also be on the statement for clues on what options are next. Full preview can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24226/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">accessed here</a>.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling underperformed the rally in risk-sensitive FX on news that PM Johnson had been hospitalised due to persistent COVID-19 symptoms after 10 days. Initially, GBP did regain strength throughout the rest of the session on the improved risk sentiment however his situation worsened throughout the afternoon and was taken to intensive care, seeing GBPUSD fall to flat/negative territory. JPMorgan's analysts argue that we have moved to a fresh 1.20-1.25 trading range and, having bumped up against the top end of that several times last week, a move to the lower end is now the more likely. The bank adds, however, with liquidity likely to remain impaired for several weeks to come, market flows are likely to dictate day-to-day moves and we expect sporadic and occasionally outsized moves to continue within that broader range.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> The Rand led the EM gains amid improved risk sentiment despite a downgrade at Fitch (it didn't have any IG ratings left after the Moody's downgrade, anyway).</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong> The Lira did not want to participate in the EMFX rally. Negative factors are conspiring for the lira, GS notes: COVID-19 is hitting tourism; oil prices have sharply risen off of lows; Turkey's low forex reserves and high dollar debt also make it vulnerable, and along with rate cuts, the CBRT announced it would engage in QE.</p><p><strong>MXN:</strong> The Peso initially weakened against the buck amid the large gap lower as oil price reopen amid the delay in the OPEC+ emergency call while traders were also underwhelmed with the size of Mexico's COVID-19 fiscal support, after the President only pledged support for workers and small business, with a commitment to fiscal discipline. However, as risk sentiment improved the MXN joined the course with the EM rally and continued its rise throughout the rest of the session. It is also worth noting Banxico’s USD 5bln credit auction saw take-up of only USD 1.58bln.</p><p><strong>ILS:</strong> The Israel central bank cut rates by 15bps to 0.1%; analyst forecasts were split between a rate cut and leaving rates unchanged at 0.25%. Alongside the rate cut, the Committee decided on two additional steps which include a new monetary instrument where monetary loans to banks for three years will have a fixed rate of 0.1%, contingent on extending credit to small and micro-businesses. The central bank also expanded its repo transactions so the agreements can now include corporate bonds in addition to government bonds. Its forecasts see its rate ending 2021 between 0-0.25%, while by the end of 2020 it expects the rate to be 0-0.1%.&nbsp; The ILS had strengthened heading into the decision but quickly snapped back to pre-announcement levels, although USDILS fell somewhat throughout the remainder of the session.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> Gold saw solid gains, despite the rally in risk, and also in spite of news that supply shortages in the physical gold market may ease over the coming weeks after three major facilities in the Swiss canton of Ticino, Europe’s biggest gold-refining hub, received permission to run at a limited rate, having been shut down for a fortnight due to COVID-19.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Risk-sensitive FX has been supported by data signalling a potential plateau of cases in key regions, while US President Trump also expressed hopes of stabilisation in key hotspots. Trump on the weekend said \"we are seeing things happen [in the data] which are very good\" - remarks which followed the prior weekend's comments where he said \"the country faces a very, very deadly period\" over the coming fortnight. Trump also added to expectations of more fiscal stimulus, including a second round of cheques for Americans.</p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The Dollar Index has struggled to deviate too much from the neutral line. There is increasing attention on the buck from non-FX traders these days; the dollar will often strengthen during risk-off episodes, due to: USD's role as world reserve currency, and reserve re-balancing; outflows out of EM (and into USD); unhedged foreign buying of Treasuries; FX-hedged international equity investors reducing over-hedges as US stocks fall. GS says that for these reasons, it is expecting USD to remain firm as long as risky assets remain weak. \"If the S&amp;P 500 makes new lows, consistent with our cross-asset views, the broad dollar will probably make new highs”. DXY remains above 100 although did weaken slightly today amid improved risk sentiment which saw EMFX rally</p><p><strong>NOK:</strong> Recent spike in EURNOK has been correcting over the last fortnight; the NOK was hit by oil prices crashing and global risk-aversion amid COVID-19, but calmer markets are allowing the NOK to rise, with some analysts suggesting that the recent plunge was overdone from a cyclical/fair value perspective. The Norges Bank has also increased daily sales of foreign exchange to an equivalent of NOK 2bln (vs NOK 0.5bln before the COVID-19 fallout).</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> A more constructive risk backdrop has seen JPY weakened, launching USDJPY above 109.00, rising as high as 109.37, but finds the air thin around the key technical zone between 109.20-30, technicians said. PM Abe stated he'd be declaring a National Emergency on Tuesday and will deliver remarks to the public explaining the strategy; he also announced a stimulus package valued at JPY 108trln, Citi thinks the declaration would probably have little direct impact on markets, including the yen. Others note that while USD funding pressures have eased, seeing JPY basis normalise to levels seen at the beginning of March (extend the other way!), the yen itself still remains a touch stronger against the USD (around 108.50 vs around 109.50 at the start of March). Technicians eye the 109.20-30 region as the key battleground in the near-term, which would open a move to 110.00-10; on the downside, technicians are watching the 108.75-80 region, and then 108.10-20 below that.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency had a relatively uneventful today ahead of the key Eurogroup meeting on Tuesday; EURUSD was lingering around 1.08. ING highlights that current FX implied volatility levels remain elevated although realised volatility is starting to drift lower, adding that some sense of calm may be returning to FX markets. The bank notes EURUSD held support at 1.0770 and it is looking for a drift higher throughout the week. On the coronavirus some reports stated that parts of Europe are starting to draw plans which would see some easing of the restrictions after a relatively low death rate in Germany.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The Aussie was one of the top performers in G10FX started the week on the attack, amid encouraging global data on COVID-19. The RBA will overnight announce its latest policy decision. There are mixed expectations, with analysts anticipating the RBA to likely keep rates on hold after its recent unprecedented action, although ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures would suggest a near coin-flip. Focus will also be on the statement for clues on what options are next. Full preview can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24226/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">accessed here</a>.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling underperformed the rally in risk-sensitive FX on news that PM Johnson had been hospitalised due to persistent COVID-19 symptoms after 10 days. Initially, GBP did regain strength throughout the rest of the session on the improved risk sentiment however his situation worsened throughout the afternoon and was taken to intensive care, seeing GBPUSD fall to flat/negative territory. JPMorgan's analysts argue that we have moved to a fresh 1.20-1.25 trading range and, having bumped up against the top end of that several times last week, a move to the lower end is now the more likely. The bank adds, however, with that liquidity likely to remain impaired for several weeks to come, market flows are likely to dictate day-to-day moves and we expect sporadic and occasionally outsized moves to continue within that broader range.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> The Rand led the EM gains amid improved risk sentiment despite a downgrade at Fitch (it didn't have any IG ratings left after the Moody's downgrade, anyway).</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong> The Lira did not want to participate in the EMFX rally. Negative factors are conspiring for the lira, GS notes: COVID-19 is hitting tourism; oil prices have sharply risen off of lows; Turkey's low forex reserves and high dollar debt also make it vulnerable, and along with rate cuts, the CBRT announced it would engage in QE.</p><p><strong>MXN:</strong> The Peso initially weakened against the buck amid the large gap lower as oil price reopen amid the delay in the OPEC+ emergency call while traders were also underwhelmed with the size of Mexico's COVID-19 fiscal support, after the President only pledged support for workers and small business, with a commitment to fiscal discipline. However as risk sentiment improved the MXN joined course with the EM rally and continued its rise throughout the rest of the session. It is also worth noting Banxico’s USD 5bln credit auction saw take up of only USD 1.58bln.</p><p><strong>ILS:</strong> The Israel central bank cut rates by 15bps to 0.1%; analyst forecasts were split between a rate cut and leaving rates unchanged at 0.25%. Alongside the rate cut, the Committee decided on two additional steps which includes a new monetary instrument where monetary loans to banks for three years will have a fixed rate of 0.1%, contingent on extending credit to small and micro businesses. The central bank also expanded its repo transactions so the agreements can now include corporate bonds in additional to government bonds. Its forecasts see its rate ending 2021 between 0-0.25%, while by the end of 2020 it expects the rate to be 0-0.1%.&nbsp; The ILS had strengthened heading into the decision but quickly snapped back to pre-announcement levels, although USDILS fell somewhat throughout the remainder of the session.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> Gold saw solid gains, despite the rally in risk, and also in spite of news that supply shortages in the physical gold market may ease over the coming weeks after three major facilities in the Swiss canton of Ticino, Europe’s biggest gold-refining hub, received permission to run at a limited rate, having been shut down for a fortnight due to COVID-19.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude was lower on Monday, opening the futures session with losses exceeding 10%; those losses pared over the course of the session, amid a constructive risk environment. However, in choppy pre-settlement trade, the complex once again endured negative ticks, with WTI ultimately settling USD 2.26 down on the day, and Brent faring slightly better with losses of USD 1.06. The driving force behind today’s action was OPEC+ postponing its tentative meeting, originally scheduled for Monday, to Thursday, with the Saudis and Russians played the blame game over whose fault it was that the OPEC+ deal collapsed (although officially, it was to allow time for negotiations between stakeholders over the level of production cuts). On Monday sources also noted that a lack of US commitment is complicating talks; that said, the CEO of RDIF Dmitriev noted that Moscow and Riyadh are said to be “very, very close” to a deal on oil production cuts, while sources suggested Russia is ready to discuss “very substantial” output cuts, adding that the 10mln BPD cut figure might not be enough. Meanwhile, US President Trump on the weekend said he was considering slapping tariffs on oil imports, or even take other such measures, in order to protect the US energy sector from falling oil prices; Canada is reportedly considering similar measures; following calls by leading lawmakers in recent weeks for such action. For reference, the US’ imports of petroleum were around 9.1mln BPD in 2019, of which Saudi and Russian imports measured just over 500k each. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Oil Ministry stated it was invited to the OPEC+ meeting on April 9th, and would consider partaking as an observer if there was broad participation; added there are no ongoing talks with oil companies on cuts. Amid storage facilities reaching capacity, US Energy Secretary Brouillette said Trump had instructed him to look for additional oil storage capacity in the US, including commercial; said all options are on the table regarding tariffs on imports of foreign oil. Brouillette also said a G20 energy ministers meeting is possible by the end of the week. On a similar vein, sources reported Saudi Arabia and other producers are reportedly looking to convince others storage is running out.</p>",

The purchase schedule again shows most reduction in long-end Treasury buying. The bank observes that, relative to the previous week, the Fed will buy roughly 27% less per day (on average daily week over week). The largest reduction vs the previous week will be in the 20-30-yera sector, where the Fed will be buying just under one-third fewer bonds (by USD value); the smallest reduction will be in the 7-20-year sector. In TIPS, the Fed will continue to buy at a rate of up to USD 5bln per day. With the US Treasury selling 3s, 10s and 30s this week, analysts suggest keeping an eye on the long-auction; \"given the holiday this week [on Friday], this relative flow of long-end Treasury supply and less demand from the Fed can put some steepening pressure on the curve,\" UBS says, \"However, we think the macro factors will continue to be supportive of 5s30s curve flatteners over the medium-term.\" (note: a full schedule of Fed purchases can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-tips-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-6th-april-2020-06-04-2020\">accessed here</a>)</li></ul><p><strong>RECENT 3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY: &nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.563%, six-auction avg. 1.367%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 2.7bps, six-auction avg. 0.6bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.20x, six-auction avg. 2.47x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 44.0%, six-auction avg. 35.3%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 3.7%, six-auction avg. 16.0%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 52.3%, six-auction avg. 48.9%)</li></ul>",

Specifically, the rate of daily change in nCoV cases and fatalities slowed in Italy and Spain to offer some hope that the peak may have been reached and both countries could see scope for further curve flattening like China.</p><p><strong>NOK/AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown continues to revel in the new and bigger Norges Bank currency buying environment, almost irrespective of crude price fluctuations as the oil major signals its intentions to join OPEC+ in any deeper production cap if an accord is reached later this week. Eur/Nok has tested bids ahead of 11.2500, but only just keeping ahead of Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd in percentage terms as the aforementioned COVID-19 developments prompt a pronounced rebound in risk sentiment. Indeed, the Aussie extended overnight gains beyond 0.6100 (just) at one stage and the Kiwi rebounded more than 100 pips from around 0.5850 before both faded ahead of NZIER Q1 confidence, AIG’s services PMI and the RBA’s April policy meeting. Note, the latter is expected to see rates maintained at the lower bound, but money markets are not ruling out further easing – full preview available via the Newsquawk Headline feed and Research Suite.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs its US peer, though some distance from 1.4100+ peaks after a rather bleak BoC business outlook report for Q1 that revealed weakness and a drop in confidence even before the nCoV outbreak. Similarly, Sterling has not been able to sustain momentum above 1.2300 in Cable or through 0.8800 on the Eur/Gbp cross after a collapse in the UK construction PMI and PM Johnson remaining in hospital with persistent virus symptoms.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen has been underperforming for the most part within a circa 109.37-108.36 band due to unwinding safe-haven flows and in anticipation of additional Japanese Government fiscal support for the economy as lockdown for 7 prefectures looms on Tuesday. However, the Euro has also been under pressure ahead of tomorrow’s Eurogroup meeting awaiting coordinated measures and following a plunge in the Sentix index, while the Franc has been cautious after yet another big jump in Swiss nabk sight deposits on the eve of official FX reserves data.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>An unexpected Bank of Israel rate cut, Fitch dragging SA deeper into junk, firmer Russian CPI, though sub-forecast and Hungary’s huge support package that investors fret about the Government being able to afford are just some of the highlights supplementing broader risk sentiment considerations for regional currencies during a volatile start to the week.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* GLOBAL EQUITIES:</strong> Stocks start the week on the front foot; virus data has provided some signs that the pace of new cases and deaths globally may be easing in some key areas, particularly in Italy and Spain, but also parts of the US; analysts state, however, that it remains too soon to draw firm conclusions, and the latest data is 'relatively' good - the situation still remains bad, and the precise impact on the economy remains uncertain. Major Asian equity indices were up: the N225, ASX and KOPSI by around 4%, and European shares following in that vein.</p><p><strong>* MACRO:</strong> The Treasury curve is bear-steepening, and yields are up across the curve by between 4-7.5bps, with underperformance in the belly. Crude is trading red, albeit off steep overnight lows; in percentage terms, the complex was red by double digits after the re-open on Sunday, though has pared that back to around 3% of losses. Gold is up by nearly 1%, and the DXY is flat.</p><p><strong>* SECTOR THEMES:</strong> Large US banks will submit capital plans to the Fed today and are expected to defend plans to continue paying dividends, after regulators in Europe urged lenders to shelve buybacks and dividends amid COVID-19. SIA reported semiconductor revenues grew 7.0% Y/Y in February, although were down 0.5% M/M, but analysts think the data for March and April will deteriorate amid COVID-19. Meanwhile, Samsung (SSNLF) is reportedly likely to reschedule its 3nm volume production to 2022, according to DigiTimes. Elsewhere, US President Trump stated he is seriously considering limiting domestic flights. Delta Airlines (DAL) CEO expects Q2 revenue to be down 90% with Q2 faring worse than Q1 and noted April capacity will be 80% smaller than initially planned. United Airlines (UAL) announced it cut roughly 80% of its capacity for April, and expects load factors to fall into the teens or single digits, while expecting even larger capacity reductions in May. It also estimates a USD 100mln revenue loss per day in March Y/Y, while expecting revenue to fall at least 30% in Q4 Y/Y. Both UAL and American Airlines (AAL) are reducing flights to the New York City area. Southwest Airlines (LUV) are reportedly evaluating all sources of capital and seeking talks regarding aid over the upcoming days. JetBlue (JBLU) announced it is burning USD 10mln per day while announcing it is to park 100 aeroplanes and cut its April flight schedule by at least 70% due to the fall in demand. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffet announced he sold 2.3mln shares of LUV and 12.9mln of DAL.</p><p><strong>* US EQUITY STORIES: </strong>Boeing Company (BA) announced it has extended its temporary suspension of its Puget Sound and Moses Lake factories for the foreseeable future. Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG) deal with Fitbit (FIT) has gathered increased scrutiny from the DoJ who are now conducting a second request review asking for further information to analyse the deal, according to NY Post citing sources. Facebook (FB) is reportedly getting a major redesign, according to Business Insider. Kraft Heinz (KHC) noted it has halted production at three of its plants but increased shifts at others to help meet high demand. Woodward (WWD) and Hexcel (HXL) announced the two have mutually decided to end its merger agreement where the two agreed to combine in an all-stock merger of equals. Wayfair (W) announced it expects to meet or exceed its Q120 guidance. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24230/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for full sheet</a>.</p><p><strong>* BROKER MOVES:</strong> <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong>&nbsp;was upgraded to Market Perform from Underperform at Raymond James, which believes the chip name is in the right place at the right time amid the coronavirus, and its cloud datacenter and service provider units are likely to remain strong, despite the ongoing economic situation. Analyst Christopher Caso also believes the demand for its commercial notebook is very strong as many more employees are now working from home, he believes this will benefit its H1 revenue although this is likely to be temporary, he writes. The analyst is however cautious of the co.’s long term structural issues, mainly its process disadvantage which is expected to continue into 2022.&nbsp;<strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong>&nbsp;was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Jefferies, where Analyst Philippe Houchois gave the co. a PT of USD 650 (Prev. USD 800, closing price USD 480.01). The analyst expects 2020 revenue growth of 27% and for earnings and free cash flow to be supported by better productivity, stable selling prices and zero-emission vehicle credit income. The analyst expects an increase in consumer support for EV. &nbsp;<strong>Spotify (SPOT)</strong>&nbsp;was double downgraded to Market Perform from Strong Buy at Raymond James, who believes that given the ongoing lockdowns, less engagements and fewer downloads are occurring and could potentially start a shift to Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Music amid an increase in the usage of its smart speaker. However, the analyst does expect a limited short-term benefit to the co. following from its focus surrounding artist tools given concert and album delays which reduces the need to market.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ENERGY:</strong> An OPEC+ call that was scheduled for Monday has been delayed until Thursday, amid an intensifying dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia over who is to blame for falling crude prices. Participants are to discuss the demand hit to crude from COVID-19, and on Monday, sources have said Moscow and Riyadh are close to a deal. Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical. Analysts do not seem to be convinced that the group will make sufficient progress; the Saudis and Russia have called for other global producers – namely US, Canada and Mexico – to share the burden of cuts, while Norway has also said it would consider cutting production in any coordinated global effort. Our full recap of the current 'state of play' can be accessed <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-opec-call-delayed-until-thursday-05-04-2020\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>* TECHNICALS:</strong> Credit Suisse said the S&amp;P 500 remains unable as yet to follow-through to the downside following last week’s rejection of key resistance at 2637/51, a region containing the long-term 200-week average and 38.2% retracement of the Q1 move lower. \"Further consolidation is looking increasingly likely, but our view remains that this is a corrective phase before trend eventually turns lower again.\"</p><p><strong>* LIQUIDITY:</strong> Nomura's quants are taking a close look at trades targeting a rebound in DM equities this week. Nomura makes the case that while liquidity conditions remain unstable, US and European equity futures liquidity is recovering, and additionally, bearish trades by CTAs look to be nearing a saturation point. \"In NASDAQ 100 futures in particular, we estimate the CTAs' positions have started to lean long,\" Nomura writes, \"given the fundamentals for the US economy, upside momentum for US equities does not have much more room to move, of course.\" However. the bank says that CTAs now seem inclined to try out long positions in the NASDAQ 100 (large-cap growth stocks) this week, and it bears watching whether the near-term improvement in supply and demand dynamics will gradually ripple out to the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA. Additionally, the bank says among hedge funds overall, an increasing number of investor types are now net buying DM equities. \"Funds following event-driven strategies and absolute return strategies also appear to be making purchases to sound out the market as more observers begin to expect the pace of new COVID-19 infections in Europe to peter out,\" but \"the heavyweights such as global macro hedge funds and long/short funds have yet to begin aggressively buying.\"</p><p><strong>* DIVIDENDS, BUYBACKS, GUIDANCE</strong>: In recent sessions we have often seen choppy, downside price action, not explained by headlines. Some say this is a result of corporates cutting outlooks for earnings, dividends, and buybacks -- widely assumed to have been one of the key supports for stocks in recent quarters/years, as we have previously noted. As of Friday, thirteen S&amp;P 500 companies have cut or suspended dividends in the last month, and 51 have suspended buybacks (these buybacks amounted to 27% of total S&amp;P 500 buybacks). The situation has scope to worsen, Goldman Sachs believes; the bank forecasts share repurchases will decline by 50% to USD 371bln this year. \"Reduced demand from the principal buyer of shares during the past decade means wider trading ranges, less downside support, and slower EPS growth,\" GS writes, \"firms prioritising buybacks have lagged YTD as investors reward firms reducing debt and those with strong balance sheets.\" It also expects dividends to decline 25% this year and expects corporate revenues will fall by 16% and margins falling 200bps, which it says could lead to a 33% decline in EPS (to USD 110 for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole). However, it sees a rebound in late 2020 and 2021.</p><p><strong>* THE US DOLLAR:</strong> Equity traders will do well to monitor the performance of the broad dollar. During the last recession, the USD peaked simultaneously as equities bottomed. In March, the DXY peaked on 20/March, and the S&amp;P 500 Emini troughed on 23/March. The dollar often strengthens during risk-off episodes, Goldman Sachs explains, due to 1) the USD's role as world reserve currency, and reserve re-balancing; 2) outflows out of EM (and into USD); 3) unhedged foreign buying of Treasuries; 4) FX-hedged international equity investors reducing over-hedges as US stocks fall. GS says that for these reasons, it is expecting USD to remain firm as long as risky assets remain weak. \"If the S&amp;P 500 makes new lows, consistent with our cross-asset views, the broad dollar will probably make new highs.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>In addition, the Committee decided on 2 additional steps:</strong></p><ul><li>To put a new monetary instrument into operation: Provision of monetary loans to banks for a term of 3 years, with a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent. The loans are contingent on extending credit to small and micro businesses.</li><li>The expansion of the plan through which repo transactions are carried out vis-à-vis financial entities, so that the agreements can include corporate bonds (in addition to government bonds) as security. This step will strengthen the plan’s support of liquidity and the orderly functioning of the financial markets.</li></ul><p><strong>STATEMENT:</strong></p><ul><li>The coronavirus crisis halted the trend of growth and the economy has shifted into contraction.&nbsp; More than one-third of the&nbsp;economy is shut down, private consumption is lower by about one-quarter relative to the pre-crisis period, and approximately 1 million workers, 24 percent of the workforce, have claimed unemployment benefits.</li><li>According to the Research Department’s assessment, GDP contracted by approximately 5 percent in the first quarter (quarterly terms). Based on the Department’s macroeconomic forecast, assuming that the main part of the coronavirus restrictions are removed gradually by the end of June, negative growth of approximately 5 percent is expected in 2020, with an unemployment rate of 6 percent (annual average). The beginning of a recovery in the third quarter will lead to growth of 9 percent in 2021, though the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually and only toward the end of 2021 will it approach the low pre-crisis levels. The debt to GDP ratio is expected to reach about 75 percent in 2020. Note that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the forecast crisis, in view of the lack of clarity about the length and magnitude of the crisis.</li><li>Global growth is expected to contract markedly in 2020, and the spread of the crisis has led to very strong policy responses by central banks and governments. Commodity prices collapsed by tens of percent. In China, a recovery in economic activity is starting to be observed.</li><li>The crisis led to a shock in capital markets in Israel and worldwide, with steep declines in equity prices and an increase in volatility&nbsp;and risk. In Israel, the sharp increase in government bond yields and in corporate bond spreads was halted following measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the halt of mutual fund withdrawals.</li><li>There was exceptional volatility in the exchange rate, against the background of dollar liquidity distress in Israel and worldwide. The swap transactions carried out by the Bank of Israel moderated the volatility, and at the end of the period, the shekel had weakened by 5.8 percent against the dollar and by 3.4 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate.</li><li>The inflation environment that was low even prior to the crisis declined sharply. The 1-year inflation expectations decreased further, but expectations for longer terms remained stable. In the short term there could be difficulty in measuring the inflation rate.</li><li>In view of the magnitude of the crisis’s adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee is utilizing a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will be able to operate additional ones, to the extent that the crisis lengthens and it is necessary to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/6-4-2020a.aspx\">Full statement</a></li></ul><p><strong>STAFF FORECASTS:</strong></p><ul><li>Inflation seen at -0.8% in 2020; 0.9% in 2021</li><li>Rates are seen ending 2020 at 0.00-0.1%; seen ending 2021 at 0.0-0.25%</li><li>Growth to contract in 2020 by 5.3% (prev. saw 2.9% growth); seen at 8.7% in 2021 (prev. seen at 3.2%)</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p>UK Ministers have begun talks on how and when lockdown rules can be eased amid concerns in the Treasury over the long-term implications of the measures. One option could involve easing by region, industrial sector or expanding the release of “key workers”. (Times) A separate report notes that whilst the lockdown is in force, it will cost the UK economy GBP 2.4bln per day. (Times) However, over the weekend, Health Secretary Hancock warned that lockdown measures could be tightened if they are required to halt the spread of COVID-19. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said there is going to be a lot of deaths in the next 2 weeks but also stated we hope we're seeing a levelling off for coronavirus in the hottest spots</strong> and that the drop in number of New York deaths could be a good sign. Trump added the US is very far down the line on developing vaccines for coronavirus and we'll see what happens, while he suggested we're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel and that he likes the concept of sending additional economic relief checks to Americans.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mostly positive and US equity futures also began the week on the front-foot as participants saw a glimmer of hope from a slowdown in the pace of coronavirus deaths</strong> for several hotspots including New York, Spain and Italy in which the latter had its lowest daily death toll since March 19th. <strong>ASX 200 (+4.3%) </strong>was underpinned amid broad gains across its sectors and with notable outperformance in healthcare following reports that Australian scientists found that Ivermectin which is produced by Merck for treatment of parasites and head lice was successful in killing coronavirus within 48 hours and that the next phase will be for human trials. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+4.2%) </strong>coat tailed on the favourable currency moves and ahead of this week’s expected roll out of the stimulus package which is said to include increased subsidies, tax deferrals and cash payments to households. <strong>Hang Seng (+2.2%)</strong> was also positive following the recent monetary policy efforts in the region including the PBoC’s 100bps RRR cut announcement and with the HKMA halving the amount of reserves banks are required to set aside against bad loans, although gains were somewhat limited amid a lack of mainland participants due to the Ching Ming holiday in China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower with prices pressured amid gains in stocks and anticipation for increased supply with the Japanese government set to announce a stimulus package and state of emergency declaration which could occur as early as tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Japanese PM Abe plans to announce a JPY 108tln stimulus package, will spend in excess of JPY 6tln for payouts to household firms, wants to issue a declaration of emergency as early as tomorrow, won't take lockdown measures like overseas cities. (Newswires) </strong><i>PM Abe is to conduct a press conference tomorrow. </i>With regards to the declaration of emergency, reports in NHK noted that Japanese PM Abe is to designate, Tokyo and six other prefectures for a state of emergency declaration lasting around one month (earlier reports had suggested around six months).</p><p>Singapore is to reportedly spend SGD 5.1bln in its third stimulus package to impact the effects of COVID-19, sources state, the country is seeking to draw SGD 4bln from past reserves for the new package.

(Politico)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equities remain firm (Eurostoxx 50 +3.8%) following a similarly positive APAC session, in which sentiment was bolstered amid positive COVID signals in key hotspots across Europe. In terms of regional performance, UK’s FTSE 100 (+2.0%) lags its peers across the channel as exporters in the index are weighed on by a firmer Sterling, whilst heavyweight energy names (Shell -0.5%, BP -2.5%) also pressure the index amid price action in the complex, with the latter also reducing production at three US refineries by ~15%. European sectors are mostly in the green (ex-energy) with cyclicals outpacing the defensives – reflecting risk appetite. Looking at the sector breakdown, Travel &amp; Leisure leads the gains following multiple consecutive sessions of underperformance, while oil and gas reside at the bottom. Despite the energy sector overall on the backfoot, Tullow Oil (+47%) and Subsea 7 (+8%) see themselves at the top of the Stoxx 600, having seen detrimental losses from the oil market crash. Looking at other individual movers, Rolls-Royce (+14.8%) shares soared higher after announcing the securing of an additional GBP 1.5bln (vs. Exp. above GBP 1bln) revolving credit facility, thus increasing overall liquidity to GBP 6.7bln. Co. also announced that around GBP 300mln of headwinds are seen from COVID-19, whilst cost-cutting measures include a minimum 10% reductions in salaries across the global workforce this year. Rolls-Royce also confirmed it is withdrawing its FY20 guidance. GVC Holdings (+6.4%) sees strength on the back of an undrawn credit facility worth GBP 550mln, whilst expecting a virus impact of GBP 50mln per month. Pirelli (+1.9%) trades higher after announcing further cost-cutting measures, albeit the Co. reduced its FY revenue guidance to EUR 4.3-4.4bln from EUR 5.4bln whilst cutting its EBIT margin target to 14-15% from 17%. Elsewhere, NN Group (-9.5%) resides at the foot of the pan-European index after postponing its dividend and suspending its EUR 250mln share buyback scheme. Broker-led price action includes BBVA (+7.8%), ADP (+6.2%), Carrefour (+2.5%), Carlsberg (+1.5%) and Nokian Renkaat (-1.0%). Finally, as US equity futures hover near session highs, it is worth keeping tabs on today’s limit-up levels: E-Mini S&amp;P (M0) 2601.50, E-Mini Nasdaq (M0) 7888.00 and E-Mini Dow (M0) 21972 – levels which have not yet been reached.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/GBP -</strong> Somewhat contrasting starts to the new week for the Euro and Pound as the former loses grip of the 1.0800 handle again vs the Dollar, but the latter pares losses close to 1.2200 and briefly trips stops at 1.2300 on the way to a circa 1.2320 recovery high on news that UK PM Johnson may be heading back to 10 Downing Street soon having been hospitalised over the weekend for nCoV related tests. Eur/Usd has been undermined by a sharp deterioration in the Eurozone Sentix Index and Eur/Gbp selling that has cushioned Sterling to an extent from a deeper than anticipated sub-50 collapse in the UK construction PMI.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/SEK -</strong> A clear risk on divide across the rest of the G10 currency spectrum, but with the Greenback gleaning more traction to counter post-NFP weakness via gains vs safer havens that have a greater weighting in the DXY basket. Indeed, the index is nudging the upper end of a 100.850-460 range even though the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie are all benefiting from less angst over COVID-19 following a decline in the number of confirmed cases and fatalities recorded in epicentres outside China including Italy and Spain. Aud/Usd is firmly back up above 0.6000 eyeing Tuesday’s RBA policy meeting when rates are expected to remain unchanged after recent emergency and scheduled easing, although money market pricing is more even between another 25 bp reduction and no further move. Nzd/Usd has reclaimed 0.5900+ status ahead of NZIER Q1 confidence, while Usd/Cad is hovering around 1.4100 vs 1.4260 at one stage as oil prices recover from another sharp retreat on a degree of OPEC+ disappointment given a delay to the emergency meeting from today until Thursday, at least. Relative calm in crude is also underpinning the Norwegian Krona along with reports that the Government may mull cutting oil output if there is general international consensus, and the Swedish Crown is tagging along.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF -</strong> The major laggards amidst renewed risk appetite on the aforementioned seemingly encouraging coronavirus developments, as the Yen falls below 109.00 and Franc meanders between 0.9762-89 in the run up to BoJ and SNB FX reserves data due tomorrow that will be monitored to see how much intervention, if any has been curbing demand for the safe havens. On that note, latest weekly Swiss bank sight deposits already reveal hefty activity as Eur/Chf remains entrenched around 1.0560.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Whippy trade in regional currencies as positive vibes from overall risk sentiment vie with far less upbeat independent factors, like the Rand having to digest another ratings cut following Fitch deciding to downgrade SA deeper into junk territory. However, Usd/Zar has managed to pare back from new 19.3400+ record highs and Eur/Huf is off its all time peak around 368.00 awaiting Hungarian PM Orban’s economic stimulus plan that could equate to 20% of GDP.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>More volatile trade in bonds as <strong>Bunds</strong> carved out a new intraday peak just a tick away from parity at 172.05 vs 171.42 at worst in wake of a dire Eurozone Sentix survey and <strong>Gilts</strong> piggy-backed to 136.68 (-4 ticks vs -1/2 point at one stage) with leverage from a bleak UK construction PMI. However, both EU benchmarks failed to sustain momentum amidst another uptick in stocks due to less severe concern over coronavirus situation. Similarly, US Treasuries have waned and are back near the base of overnight ranges in anticipation of Wall Street emulating the strong performance implied by equity futures.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent front-month futures remain subdued</strong>, albeit way off the lows posted at the electronic open in which the contracts fell some 10% after OPEC+ postponed its tentative meeting, whilst Saudi and Russia played the blame game over the weekend. In terms of where we stand, the OPEC+ meeting will now be conducted on Thursday instead of the initially planned Monday – with sources noting the delay was to convince other countries to join in on output curtailment plant. Prices were also pressured after Russian President Putin partly blamed Saudi Arabia for the collapse in prices, whilst the Kingdom points the finger at Moscow’s hesitation at the March OPEC meeting – sources also noted that a lack of US commitment is complicating talks. That being said, the CEO of RDIF Dmitriev noted that Moscow and Riyadh are said to be “very, very close” to a deal on oil production cuts. Meanwhile, US President Trump on the weekend said he was considering slapping tariffs on oil imports, or even take other such measures, in order to protect the US energy sector from falling oil prices; Canada is reportedly considering similar measures. Following calls by leading lawmakers in recent weeks for such action. For reference, the US’ imports of petroleum were around 9.1mln BPD in 2019, of which Saudi and Russian imports measured just over 500k each. WTI May futures dipped below its 21 DMA (USD 25.89/bbl) at the open to a low of USD 25.28/bbl before recouping losses amid the overall risk appetite and the prospect of US intervention in the oil markets. Similarly, Brent June printed a low of USD 30.00/bbl, ahead of its respective 21 DMA at USD 29.26/bbl, with prices eyeing USD 34/bbl at the time of writing. The spread between the contracts has also widened to ~USD 6/bbl from Friday’s almost USD 4/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold gains</strong> ground above USD 1600/oz as the USD retreats, and from a technical standpoint, the yellow metal could see mild resistance at USD 1637.50/oz (30 Mar high) before some psychological play at USD 1640/oz. In terms of news-flow for gold, gold refiners PAMP, Valcambi and Argor-Heraeus have been given approval to restart operations at 50% max capacity, having been asked to shut operations in late March.<strong> Copper</strong> meanwhile remains contained within the tight USD 2.15-2.25/lb range seen over the past 4 sessions, with the red metal again mimicking price action in global stocks.</p><p><strong>OPEC+ meeting was delayed a few days and will now be conducted on Thursday instead of the initially planned Monday</strong>. Subsequently, <strong>Russia's Kremlin says talks between OPEC+ are postponed until Thursday, due to technical reasons</strong>, with the talks being prepared; are <strong>ready to co-operate with other oil exporting countries to stabilise markets. </strong>(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said that he couldn’t care less about OPEC and they are destroying themselves, while separately stated he would have to do substantial tariffs if oil prices stay the way they are but doesn't think it will be needed</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>Russia and Saudi Arabia are reportedly 'very, very close' to a deal on oil production cuts, according to Dmitriev the CEO of RDIF.

Looking at other individual movers, Rolls-Royce (+14.8%) shares soared higher after announcing the securing of an additional GBP 1.5bln (vs. Exp. above GBP 1bln) revolving credit facility, thus increasing overall liquidity to GBP 6.7bln. Co. also announced that around GBP 300mln of headwinds are seen from COVID-19, whilst cost-cutting measures include a minimum 10% reductions in salaries across the global workforce this year. Rolls-Royce also confirmed it is withdrawing its FY20 guidance. GVC Holdings (+6.4%) sees strength on the back of an undrawn credit facility worth GBP 550mln, whilst expecting a virus impact of GBP 50mln per month. Pirelli (+1.9%) trades higher after announcing further cost-cutting measures, albeit the Co. reduced its FY revenue guidance to EUR 4.3-4.4bln from EUR 5.4bln whilst cutting its EBIT margin target to 14-15% from 17%. Elsewhere, NN Group (-9.5%) resides at the foot of the pan-European index after postponing its dividend and suspending its EUR 250mln share buyback scheme. Broker-led price action includes BBVA (+7.8%), ADP (+6.2%), Carrefour (+2.5%), Carlsberg (+1.5%) and Nokian Renkaat (-1.0%). Finally, as US equity futures hover near session highs, it is worth keeping tabs on today’s limit-up levels: E-Mini S&amp;P (M0) 2601.50, E-Mini Nasdaq (M0) 7888.00 and E-Mini Dow (M0) 21972 – levels which have not yet been reached.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong> - Somewhat contrasting starts to the new week for the Euro and Pound as the former loses grip of the 1.0800 handle again vs the Dollar, but the latter pares losses close to 1.2200 and briefly trips stops at 1.2300 on the way to a circa 1.2320 recovery high on news that UK PM Johnson may be heading back to 10 Downing Street soon having been hospitalised over the weekend for nCoV related tests.

In terms of where we stand, the OPEC+ meeting will now be conducted on Thursday instead of the initially planned Monday – with sources noting the delay was to convince other countries to join in on output curtailment plant. Prices were also pressured after Russian President Putin partly blamed Saudi Arabia for the collapse in prices, whilst the Kingdom points the finger at Moscow’s hesitation at the March OPEC meeting – sources also noted that a lack of US commitment is complicating talks. That being said, the CEO of RDIF Dmitriev noted that Moscow and Riyadh are said to be “very, very close” to a deal on oil production cuts. Meanwhile, US President Trump on the weekend said he was considering slapping tariffs on oil imports, or even take other such measures, in order to protect the US energy sector from falling oil prices; Canada is reportedly considering similar measures. Following calls by leading lawmakers in recent weeks for such action. For reference, the US’ imports of petroleum were around 9.1mln BPD in 2019, of which Saudi and Russian imports measured just over 500k each. <strong>WTI</strong> May futures dipped below its 21 DMA (USD 25.89/bbl) at the open to a low of USD 25.28/bbl before recouping losses amid the overall risk appetite and the prospect of US intervention in the oil markets. Similarly, <strong>Brent</strong> June printed a low of USD 30.00/bbl, ahead of its respective 21 DMA at USD 29.26/bbl, with prices eyeing USD 34/bbl at the time of writing. The spread between the contracts has also widened to ~USD 6/bbl from Friday’s almost USD 4/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> gains ground above USD 1600/oz as the USD retreats, and from a technical standpoint, the yellow metal could see mild resistance at USD 1637.50/oz (30 Mar high) before some psychological play at USD 1640/oz. In terms of news-flow for gold, gold refiners PAMP, Valcambi and Argor-Heraeus have been given approval to restart operations at 50% max capacity, having been asked to shut operations in late March. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile remains contained within the tight USD 2.15-2.25/lb range seen over the past 4 sessions, with the red metal again mimicking price action in global stocks.</p>",

The purchase schedule again shows most reduction in long-end Treasury buying. The bank observes that, relative to the previous week, the Fed will buy roughly 27% less per day (on average daily week over week). The largest reduction vs the previous week will be in the 20-30-yera sector, where the Fed will be buying just under one-third fewer bonds (by USD value); the smallest reduction will be in the 7-20-year sector. In TIPS, the Fed will continue to buy at a rate of up to USD 5bln per day. With the US Treasury selling 3s, 10s and 30s this week, analysts suggest keeping an eye on the long-auction; \"given the holiday this week [on Friday], this relative flow of long-end Treasury supply and less demand from the Fed can put some steepening pressure on the curve,\" UBS says, \"However, we think the macro factors will continue to be supportive of 5s30s curve flatteners over the medium-term.\" (note: a full schedule of Fed purchases can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-tips-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-6th-april-2020-06-04-2020  \">accessed here</a>)&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>RECENT 3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY: &nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.563%, six-auction avg. 1.367%) &nbsp;</li><li>Tail: (prev. 2.7bps, six-auction avg. 0.6bps) &nbsp;</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.20x, six-auction avg. 2.47x) &nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 44.0%, six-auction avg. 35.3%) &nbsp;</li><li>Direct: (prev. 3.7%, six-auction avg. 16.0%) &nbsp;</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 52.3%, six-auction avg. 48.9%) &nbsp;</li></ul>",

The purchase schedule again shows most reduction in long-end Treasury buying. The bank observes that, relative to the previous week, the Fed will buy roughly 27% less per day (on average daily week over week). The largest reduction vs the previous week will be in the 20-30-yera sector, where the Fed will be buying just under one-third fewer bonds (by USD value); the smallest reduction will be in the 7-20-year sector. In TIPS, the Fed will continue to buy at a rate of up to USD 5bln per day. With the US Treasury selling 3s, 10s and 30s this week, analysts suggest keeping an eye on the long-auction; \"given the holiday this week [on Friday], this relative flow of long-end Treasury supply and less demand from the Fed can put some steepening pressure on the curve,\" UBS says, \"However, we think the macro factors will continue to be supportive of 5s30s curve flatteners over the medium-term.\" &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Schedule and amounts of purchases - all times ET (BST-5, CET-6)</strong></p><ul><li>09:30-09:50 ET: Fed buys Treasury Coupons 7 to 20 year sector (USD 7bln): offer-to-cover (prev. 2.29x)</li><li>10:20-10:40 ET: Fed buys Treasury Coupons 4.5 to 7 year sector (USD 10bln): offer-to-cover (prev. 2.25x)</li><li>11:00-11:20 ET: Fed buys Treasury Coupons 20 to 30 year sector (USD 5bln): offer-to-cover (prev. 2.12x)</li><li>12:00-12:20 ET: Fed buys Treasury Coupons 0 to 2.25 year sector (USD 21bln): offer-to-cover (prev. 2.56x)</li><li>12:50-13:10 ET: Fed buys TIPS 1 to 7.5 year sector (USD 5bln): offer-to-cover (prev. 1.83x)</li><li>Via <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/treasury-securities-schedule-past/HTPC_0406_0409_2020.pdf\">NY Fed</a></li></ul>",

To recap, Bunds benefited from a short squeeze ahead of the Liffe and EU index opens at 171.94, but then recoiled sharply to a fresh 171.42 intraday Eurex low before meeting more underlying bids. Next up in the UK, construction PMI following weak services and composite surveys, plus extremely downbeat GfK consumer sentiment overnight.</p>",

However, Bunds remain under pressure amidst a broad recovery in risk sentiment post-NFP prompted by COVID-19 developments over the weekend. In short, although the number of global cases and deaths continues to rise, the pace appears to be abating in areas that have surpassed China since the outbreak escalated from epidemic to pandemic, to provide some relief and hope that the worst may be over. Meanwhile, the Eurozone is expected to unveil its united fiscal support package in the next few days and latest reports suggest more aid could be forthcoming for Italy via the ESM. More immediately, the Sentix Index for April is due and most probably far too soon to show any improvement ahead of latest weekly ECB APP totals and the first full week of PEPP.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX bull flattened, catching upward momentum in the US session as equities drifted lower and a cooling in corporate issuance – the -700k NFP report had little immediate market impact. One desk noted that the bid was mostly a function of leveraged fund types, although real money did “nibble”. Furthermore, corporate issuance took a breather on Friday, with just a couple of IG issuers, likely supporting the bid out the curve. FedEx (FDX) was one of the issuers, raising capital further out the curve in order to pay off credit facilities it had drawn down on. This method has become more frequent recently, and is supporting the bounce back in issuance, as corporates raise capital in longer maturities to address their large credit facility drawdowns and commercial paper issuance. Meanwhile, the Fed continued its Treasury purchases (at the reduced clip of USD 60bln per day), also supporting the flattener, and in contrast to recent sessions, Treasuries maintained their bid after the Fed completed its purchases, whereas recent sessions have seen participants selling into the operations. By settlement, 2s -1bps at 0.21%, 10s -4bps at 0.59%, 30s -5bps at 1.22%. T-note (M0) futures settled 8 ticks higher at 139-04+.</p><p>NY Fed plans to purchase USD 200bln worth of treasury securities this week ay USD 50bln per day on average through April 6th-9th (Prev.

ASX 200 (+4.3%) was underpinned amid broad gains across its sectors and with notable outperformance in healthcare following reports that Australian scientists found that Ivermectin which is produced by Merck for treatment of parasites and head lice was successful in killing coronavirus within 48 hours and that the next phase will be for human trials. Nikkei 225 (+2.3%) coat tailed on the favourable currency moves and ahead of this week’s expected roll out of the stimulus package which is said to include increased subsidies, tax deferrals and cash payments to households. Hang Seng (+1.3%) was also positive following the recent monetary policy efforts in the region including the PBoC’s 100bps RRR cut announcement and with the HKMA halving the amount of reserves banks are required to set aside against bad loans, although gains were somewhat limited amid a lack of mainland participants due to the Ching Ming holiday in China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower with prices pressured amid gains in stocks and anticipation for increased supply with the Japanese government set to announce a stimulus package and state of emergency declaration which could occur as early as tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive and US equity futures also begin the week on the front-foot as participants see a glimmer of hope from a slowdown in the pace of coronavirus deaths for several hotspots including New York, Spain and Italy in which the latter had its lowest daily death toll since March 19th. ASX 200 (+3.3%) is underpinned amid broad gains across its sectors and with notable outperformance in healthcare following reports that Australian scientists found that Ivermectin which is produced by Merck for treatment of parasites and head lice was successful in killing coronavirus within 48 hours and that the next phase will be for human trials, while Nikkei 225 (+2.2%) coattails on the favourable currency moves and ahead of this week’s expected roll out of the stimulus package which will include increased subsidies, tax deferrals and cash payments to households. Hang Seng (+0.9%) is also positive following the monetary policy efforts in the region including the PBoC’s 100bps RRR cut announcement and with the HKMA to halve the amount of reserves banks are required to set aside against bad loans, but with the gains somewhat limited amid a lack of mainland participants due to the Ching Ming holiday in China.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively stable north of the 100.50 level after last week’s momentum stalled in the wake of the poor NFP numbers which showed the early effects of the coronavirus fallout on employment as it registered a 701k decline in jobs for the first contraction since 2010 and the Unemployment Rate surged to 4.4% from 3.5%. Nonetheless, its transatlantic counterparts failed to take advantage of the recent weak US jobs data with EUR/USD flat around the 108.00 level as the ongoing fallout and disruption of the pandemic is offset by the decline in the Italy’s COVID-19 curve and after Spain also reported a 3rd consecutive decline in its daily death toll, while GBP/USD is subdued below 1.2250 after UK PM Johnson was taken to hospital although this was said to be for tests and was just a precautionary step amid persistent symptoms after having confirmed positive for the virus 10 days prior. Elsewhere, USD/JPY tested 109.00 to the upside and JPY crosses were also underpinned amid the positive risk sentiment, while AUD/USD marginally benefitted due to its high beta status but with gains capped heading into tomorrow’s RBA meeting where analysts anticipate no change in rates but money markets are pricing in a near coin-flip between a 25bps cut and a hold.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices pressured amid gains in stocks and anticipation for increased supply with the Japanese government set to announce a stimulus package and potential state of emergency declaration which could occur as early as tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>",
