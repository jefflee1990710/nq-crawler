        "content": "<p><strong>FED CHAIR POWELL TESTIMONY</strong></p><p>Fed Chair Powell’s (Neutral) text release prior to the semi-annual testimony stated the Fed will act as appropriate to sustain US economic growth and that there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than the Fed is currently anticipating, while he added that US economic growth appears to have moderated in Q2 and momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies in recent months. However, Powell also noted that the Fed's baseline outlook is for inflation to move back towards the 2% target and for the US economic growth to remain solid as well as labour markets to remain strong. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed Chair Powell then commented during the testimony that many at the Fed see a stronger case for more accommodative monetary policy given current trade uncertainties and that the June employment report did not fundamentally change the Fed's outlook. Powell further commented that the current level of wage growth is not high enough to put upward pressure on inflation, that a 'hot' labour market is not a current issue and has no evidence to call this market one, while he also suggested China talks are a good sign but does not remove uncertainty.</p><p>Note: Powell’s comments were seen as dovish as the language indicated that the assessment of inflation has changed from 'transitory' to 'persistent' in terms of the downside risks to inflation, while many suggested Powell has left the door for a rate cut at the July meeting and effectively dispelled expectations the Fed would hold back following the US-China trade \"truce\" and strong June NFP data.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FOMC MINUTES</strong></p><p>FOMC Minutes stated that many participants saw a rate cut as warranted in the \"near term\" if trade and other global risks continued to weigh on the outlook, while several policymakers also said a rate cut could be appropriate if the incoming data showed further deterioration and a couple of participants favoured cutting rates at the June meeting. (Newswires)</p><p>Furthermore, participants focused on global risks and discussed \"at some length\" soft business investment data from Q2, while many attached significant odds to less favourable outlooks than their base case of continued growth and strong hiring. Many also noted that growth and inflation risks had shifted \"notably\" in the weeks leading up to the meeting and are now \"weighted to the downside\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>China's State Council said they are to continue to reduce tariffs and will improve exports tax rebate policies. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times Editor Hu Xijin tweeted that the Chinese side only confirmed the phone conversation between top trade negotiators without mentioning the conversation being “constructive” as described by the US side. (Twitter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>BoE's Tenreyro said a small amount of policy tightening will likely be needed in the event of a smooth Brexit and that if a Brexit deal is reached, a stronger GBP would ease inflation pressure especially given the prospects of looser policy abroad. Tenreyro added she does not see inflation pressures picking up in the next few months but also noted that core inflation metrics still stable and that there are few signs of weakness in inflation expectations, while the labour market remains tight.

BoC statement made no mention of a change to its future rate path and stated that the central bank remains in a neutral and data-dependent stance. BoC added that escalation of trade conflicts remains the biggest downside risk to the global and Canadian outlooks, while it has made further adjustments in light of weaker sentiment and activity in major economies. BoC added that it is paying attention to data, in particular to developments in the energy sector and that growth in the second quarter appears to be stronger than predicted due to some temporary factors. (Newswires)</p><p>BoC also noted that Canadian and US economies are converging not diverging and that Canada is returning to the potential growth rate, while it added that trade conflicts and uncertainty are projected to cut the level of Canadian GDP by as much as 2% by the end of 2021 but also answered that today's forecast is balanced when asked about an cautionary rate cut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks -9.499M vs. Exp. -3.081M (Prev. -1.085M). (Newswires)</p><p>US Gulf of Mexico crude oil production was reportedly cut by 32% (a 603k BPD cut) with 15 platforms and 4 rigs evacuated and three rigs moved ahead of the storm, according to the US government. (Newswires)</p><p>NHC said a Tropical Cyclone is expected to form by Thursday over the Northern Gulf of Mexico and that storm surge as well as tropical storm watches have been issued with heavy rainfall expected, while it also noted that heavy rains and flooding is already occurring over portions of southeast Louisiana. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US President Trump stated Iran has long been secretly violating the nuclear deal and that sanctions will soon be increased substantially. However, there were also reports that US remain open to discussions with Iran and offer the prospect of a full normalisation of relations according to a statement to the IAEA, while the Iranian envoy to the UN nuclear watchdog board meeting said every single nuclear activity in Iran is under IAEA monitoring and that Iran has nothing to hide.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Amazon (AMZN) shares were supported by positive comments from Cowen, who said they expect Prime Day to breach new sales records. Apple (AAPL) outperformed the Nasdaq after Evercore ISI raised their PT for the tech co. T-Mobile US (TMUS) jumped higher premarket on the news it would be added to the S&amp;P500 index later this month. Comcast (CMCSA) was buoyed on an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. Tesla (TSLA) gained premarket after newswires reported internal email hinting at a production increase in Freemont, California factory. American Airlines (AAL) raised its forecast for Q2 revenue growth, moving its shares, and that of rivals such as United Continental (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU), higher in tandem. Deere &amp; Co (DE) was under pressure after being downgraded at UBS. Levi Straus &amp; Co. (LEVI) sunk after the co. missed profit expectations for Q2. McDermott International (MDR) shot higher after the co. landed a USD 1.5bln contract with Saudi Aramco. Susquehanna commented that it prefers diversified oil service companies, sending the likes of Schlumberger (SLB), Keane Group (FRAC) and Halliburton (HAL) higher. EQT (EDT) shares popped higher after shares popped higher after Rice Group took control of the board. S&amp;P 500 0.5% at 2993, NASDAQ-100 1% at 7903, Dow Jones 0.3% at 26860.</p><p>The curve bull-steepened after Fed Chair Powell’s testimony to lawmakers left the door open for a rate cut at the July policy meeting. In wake of Powell’s testimony, money markets now price around 68bps of easing through the year end (it was around 51bps pre-Powell’s testimony). Crucially, the prospects of a double rate cut are being priced back in, after the markets priced them out in wake of the solid NFP report last week; markets now see an approximately 25% of a double cut – that had fallen to around 2.5% after the payrolls data. After the testimony, the US sold 10-year notes at 2.057%, a poor auction which tailed by 0.7bps, and on cover beneath recent averages. Dealers had the highest takedown since October 2018. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with the most notable steepening seen in 2s30s, which was greater than +11bps on the session. US T-note futures (U9) settled 4+ ticks higher at 127-14.</p>",

Consequently, the dollar weakened, sending gold back above the 1400 level, comfortably. Crude was also on a rally for its own reasons; namely bullish US inventories and weather-related supply disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p><strong>* POWELL TESTIMONY: </strong>Fed Chair Powell did nothing to lean back on the notion that the Fed will be cutting rates at the July meeting, likely by 25bps. Powell’s comments were interpreted as dovish, with risk assets rallying, seeing US stocks hit fresh intraday record highs. Despite the recent trade truce reached at the G20, the Fed still continues to cite the potential negative fall-out from trade escalation. Powell reiterated that the Fed will act as appropriate to sustain US economic growth, which he said appears to have moderated in Q2, while momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies in recent months. The warnings on inflation seem to have sealed the case for a rate cut, with Powell stating that there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than the Fed is currently anticipating, though the baseline outlook was for inflation to move back towards the Bank's 2% target, and for US economic growth to remain solid, and labour markets to remain strong. Finally, Powell said that long-term challenges for the US economy include high and rising federal debt, and relative stagnation of middle and lower incomes. After the release of Powell's remarks, money markets once again began pricing in the prospect of a 50bps rate cut at the July meeting (12.5% priced now, vs 2.5% on Tuesday), and the market sees around 67bps of easing through the end of the year (on Tuesday, it had fallen to around 56bps). During the Q&amp;A period, Powell reiterated that he intends to serve his full-term, and would not leave if President Trump asked him to. Powell said that the June employment report did not fundamentally change the Fed's outlook; adding that China talks are a good sign, but do not remove uncertainty.</p><p><strong>* FED MINUTES: </strong>Somewhat overshadowed by the Powell testimony. The minutes showed many participants saw a rate cut as warranted in the \"near term\" if trade and other global risks continued to weigh on the outlook. On rates/policy: several policymakers said a rate cut could be appropriate if the incoming data showed further deterioration, a couple of participants favoured cutting rates at the June meeting. On inflation/outlook, participants focused on global risks and discussed \"at some length\" soft business investment data from Q2, many attached significant odds to less favourable outlooks than their base case of continued growth and strong hiring, while many noted that growth and inflation risks had shifted \"notably\" in the weeks leading up to the meeting, and are now \"weighted to the downside\". The minutes also revealed that Fed staff gave a presentation on a standing repo facility, though no decision was taken. Analysts say this might be the more interesting aspect of the minutes, and could suggest that a repo facility remains very much alive, a tool that should allow the Fed to control the topside of the effective funds rate. At the moment, The Fed must rely on the IOER and arbitrage opportunities to do the job, which is a rickety state of affairs. All else being equal, a repo facility would lower the effective funds rate, analysts say, or at least lower the threat of it trading outside of the target range.</p><p><strong>* BULLARD:</strong> <strong>Fed's Bullard</strong> (voter, dove) said that at the moment he supports a 25bps rate cut, but a 50bps cut would be too much. He added that he has pencilled in another rate cut before the year’s end, but this would be dependent on developments in the economy. He urged the Fed to focus on re-centring inflation and inflation expectations on to 2.0%. He said the FOMC should have forgone hikes last December, and the Fed was overly pre-emptive in December with inflation so low. He believes good things are happening in the labour market. In, perhaps, a veiled allusion to President Trump, he said every real estate person, and most politicians, wants lower rates; and it doesn't bother him to have some input from politicians. On the July meeting, he said he didn’t want to pre-judge the outcome (although you will recall he has previously hinted that a 25bps rate cut may be appropriate). Bullard said he was supportive of US President Trump's pick for the St Louis fed, Waller, and that he would be independent if nominated and holds views that are close to his own.</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The Bank held rates at 1.75%, as was expected; it left its estimate of the neutral rate at 2.25% to 3.25%; it also maintained its view of the output gap at -1.25 to -0.25%. It’s near-term growth projections were nudged higher (though warned the stronger growth in Q2 may be temporary), though 2020 was revised down; near-term inflation forecasts were raised, though for the year it was lowered, and 2020 was unchanged (the BOC said higher food and automobile prices have been an upward pressure to inflation; inflation will likely dip this year because of the dynamics of gasoline prices and some other temporary factors, but expect it to return sustainably to 2% by mid-2020). Its bias was judged to remain in neutral and data-dependent (some had expected an easing bias, which would have been difficult while it was upgrading near-term growth views). On the housing market, the BOC saw stabilisation, although it said that significant adjustments are still underway in some regions.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINS PREVIEW:</strong> The minutes are likely to underline the dovish messaging from central bank officials of late: last week, Knott said expectations for Q2 and Q3 are less favourable than Q1, adding it's indisputable that inflation remains too low, and the Bank is ready to act in adverse scenarios. Later in the week, Rehn said further monetary stimulus is now needed until there is an improvement in economic and inflation prospects, if the central bank is to meet its mandate, adding that the slowdown was no longer temporary. And then there is the prospect of Lagarde at the helm of the ECB, and desks continue to size-up the implications of IMF head taking over from Draghi; general run of opinions is that she’d be a dovish, continuity candidate. Indeed, the IMF’s most recent Article IV on the Euro area warned of a “precarious central forecast” and found that a downgrade of the inflation outlook could require even more accommodation from the central bank. Desks have taken this as a suggestion that Lagarde appears to have already backed lower rates and QE2. “Under her leadership the IMF has generally seemed to take a more 'Anglo-Saxon' as opposed to 'Germanic' view on monetary policy issues, largely in line with previous Fed chairs Bernanke and Yellen, as well as current ECB President Draghi and BoJ Governor Kuroda,” UBS said, “for investors, this means that further asset purchases by the ECB should very much be expected, with Draghi probably raising the issuer limit to 50% in September.” UBS thinks that the picture is less clear on negative rates, but says it may create an additional incentive for Draghi to push through tiering and further rate cut before his terms ends.</p><p><strong>* CHINA CPI:</strong> Met expectations at 2.7% Y/Y, and remains at 15-month highs, on the back of supply shocks driving food prices higher; analysts say this will not concern the PBOC given the firmness of inflation is driven by supply shocks, not a boost in underlying prices. Crucially, the data is unlikely to stop the PBOC from easing, UBS said.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The White House is likely to send the USMCA trade deal to Congress after September 1st, CNBC reported. The bill could be sent to Congress as soon as this week, setting up a vote by the end of the year. Elsewhere, China Global Times Editor said that that the Chinese side only confirmed the phone conversation, but did not say that it was “constructive” as described by the US side, in what seems to be another attempt to downplay optimism that the two sides can bridge the current divide. Later in the session, it was reported that US officials are reportedly studying French plans to tax tech companies, which might set the stage for potential retaliatory tariffs; USTR has been given up to a year to ascertain if tax plan affects US companies.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> US President Trump said that Iran has long been secretly violating the nuclear deal, and sanctions will soon be increased substantially. US Envoy to Iran Hook said the US is looking for a Congress-ratified agreement, not just a political commitment. Also, the US said in a letter to the IAEA that it remains open to the possibility of discussions with Iran, and again offered the prospect of a full normalisation of relations.</p><p><strong>* UK DATA: </strong>UK GDP M/M (May) rebounded to 0.3%, above the consensus for 0.1% and the previous months contraction of -0.4%. Construction came in at 0.6% M/M, above expectations for 0.5%. Industrial Output and Manufacturing Output both came in at 1.4% M/M, missing expectations for 1.5% and 2.1% respectively. Although manufacturing output increased in May, it failed to recover April’s losses of -4.2%. ING notes that the rebound in the GDP growth in May was largely driven by increases in production. The bank reminds us of the collapse in manufacturing output back in April (-4.2%) and attributes two main causes; “Firstly, various car producers brought forward their usual summer factory shutdowns to the start of April… Secondly – and more importantly – new orders slumped as firms grapple with what to do with the stockpiles they built up during the first quarter, in anticipation of a possible ‘no deal’ Brexit”. The bank expects this latter trend to continue the coming month as the Brexit related uncertainty continues. Turning to the implications of the current growth trend to BoE policy making, ING positsvbe “With the growth story unlikely to improve dramatically in the third quarter, we think the Bank of England is likely to keep policy on hold this year”.</p><p><strong>* BOE’S TENREYRO: </strong>BOE's Tenreyro said a small amount of policy tightening will likely be needed in the event of a smooth Brexit but if a Brexit deal is reached, the stronger GBP would ease inflation pressure, especially given the prospects of looser policy abroad. She added that she does not see inflation pressures picking up in the next few months and that core inflation metrics are still stable, while there are few signs of weakness in inflation expectations. Tenreyro added that it is likely a no-deal scenario would necessitate looser monetary policy, though this is by no means a certain outcome and also mentioned that trade tensions add downside risks for the economy.</p><p><strong>* BRAZIL PENSION REFORM: </strong>Brazilian President Bolsonaro said he is confident that Congress will vote on and approve the pension reform bill. His chief of staff Lorenzoni later confirmed that the Lower House first round vote will take place on Wednesday, and the second-round vote on Friday. For reference, the Brazilian Parliament are scheduled to go on recess on the 19th of July as such expectations are for the vote to take place (and pass) before then.</p><p><strong>* BRAZIL IPCA INFLATION:</strong> Brazil’s IPCA inflation index was unchanged M/M in June, in line with the consensus while the Y/Y rate fell to 3.4% from 4.7% in May, also inline. Pantheon note that the fall in inflation, which leaves it near the bottom of the BCB’s target range, is due mainly to a favourable base effect; “the hit from the truckers’ strike last year fell out of the Y/Y equation”. The consultancy notes “(lower inflation) will be supported by the effect of the BRL’s rally since mid-May, as political-related news, particularly on pension reform, is turning positive”. Regarding the BCB policy making going forward; Pantheon comments that if progress on pension reform continues, the BRL would be boosted, inflation expectations lowered and Brazil’s risk metrics improved which, when combined with current subdued levels of inflation, would open up the door to easier monetary policy.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong>&nbsp;June's 30-year auction saw decent demand, with cover at the highest since October 2018, and stopping through by 0.4bps on a yield that was lowest since 2016. The most recent primary dealer data shows holdings of USD 40.3bln in the 11-year+ sector, the lowest in five months. From a RV perspective, SocGen's analysts say that the 30-year sector appears to be trading fair on asset-swap, while the 5s30s curve has flattened in the last fortnight after reaching multi-month highs, and appears rich. A steepening of the curve from here should marginally support demand for the auction even though the current WI yield is trading below all auction stops since October 2016, SocGen says.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 127-14: </strong>The curve bull-steepened after Fed Chair Powell’s testimony to lawmakers left the door open for a rate cut at the July policy meeting. In wake of Powell’s testimony, money markets now price around 68bps of easing through the year end (it was around 51bps pre-Powell’s testimony). Crucially, the prospects of a double rate cut are being priced back in, after the markets priced them out in wake of the solid NFP report last week; markets now see an approximately 25% of a double cut – that had fallen to around 2.5% after the payrolls data. After the testimony, the US sold 10-year notes at 2.057%, a poor auction which tailed by 0.7bps, and on cover beneath recent averages. Dealers had the highest takedown since October 2018. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with the most notable steepening seen in 2s30s, which was greater than +11bps on the session.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLE USD 2.60 HIGHER AT USD 60.43/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 2.85 HIGHER AT USD 67.01/BBL: </strong>After two days of undecisive price action, oil prices have surged higher on Wednesday on a cocktail of price-positive factors, namely bullish crude inventories and a growing storm in the Gulf of Mexico. The API reported 8.1mln draw in US crude stocks on Tuesday, helping the crude complex get-off the front-foot; that DOE data was corroborated by the official DoE release, which showed crude stocks drawing down by 9.5mln bbls (exp. -3.1mln), stocks at Cushing drawing by 0.3mln bbls; in the products, gasoline drew down by 1.5mln bbls (exp. -1.3mln) and distillates built by 3.7mln bbls (exp. +0.7mln). Elsewhere in the EIA report, production ramped up to 12.3mln BPD from 12.2mln BPD, accompanied by +0.5% refinery utilisation (exp. +0.2%). Reports of oil majors in the Gulf of Mexico shuttering operations at Deepwater facilities due to weather warnings is also providing oil with vigour. The NHC announced that a Tropical Cyclone is expected to form by Thursday over the Northern Gulf of Mexico, where storm surge and tropical storm watches have been issued and heavy rainfall is to be expected; the NHC later reported a second Tropical Cyclone had formed, too.</p><p><strong>* GULF OF MEXICO: </strong>US Gulf of Mexico crude oil production has been cut by 32% (a 603k BPD cut), with 15 platforms and four rigs evacuated, and three rigs moved ahead of the storm, according to the US government.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.5% at 2993, NASDAQ-100 1% at 7903, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.3% at 26860, Sectors; Consumer Discretionary 0.4%, Consumer Staples 0.7%, Energy 1.4%, Financials&nbsp; 0.5%, Health Care 0.4%, Industrials -0.3%, Information Technology 0.8%, Materials -0.2%, Services 1.3%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.3%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Amazon (AMZN) shares were supported by positive comments from Cowen, who said they expect Prime Day to breach new sales records. Apple (AAPL) outperformed the Nasdaq after Evercore ISI raised their PT for the tech co. T-Mobile US (TMUS) jumped higher premarket on the news it would be added to the S&amp;P500 index later this month. Comcast (CMCSA) was buoyed on an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. Tesla (TSLA) gained premarket after newswires reported internal email hinting at a production increase in Freemont, California factory. American Airlines (AAL) raised its forecast for Q2 revenue growth, moving its shares, and that of rivals such as United Continental (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU), higher in tandem. Deere &amp; Co (DE) was under pressure after being downgraded at UBS. Levi Straus &amp; Co. (LEVI) sunk after the co. missed profit expectations for Q2. McDermott International (MDR) shot higher after the co. landed a USD 1.5bln contract with Saudi Aramco. Susquehanna commented that it prefers diversified oil service companies, sending the likes of Schlumberger (SLB), Keane Group (FRAC) and Halliburton (HAL) higher. EQT (EDT) shares popped higher after shares popped higher after Rice Group took control of the board.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>sunk after the dovish Semi-Annual Testimony statement from Fed chair Powell, in which he opted not to push back against the markets pricing for at least a 25bps cut later this month. <strong>DXY </strong>was sent reeling back towards 97.00, while <strong>EUR </strong>and <strong>JPY </strong>both advanced, moving to the 1.1250 and 108.50 areas respectively. Gold (<strong>XAU</strong>) rallied back above 1400. <strong>GBP </strong>saw early gains as May GDP data surprised to the upside, before extending gains on later dollar weakness, and retaining 1.25. <strong>EMFX </strong>benefited from the Fed dovishness, with the notable exception of the <strong>MXN</strong>, held back by political concerns (President Obrador commented that more resignations may follow that of the Finance Minister on Tuesday, moving as high as 19.30 on the day vs the greenback). It was a double whammy for the <strong>BRL</strong>, which rallied in the aftermath of Powell’s testimony, before garnering further momentum on news that both rounds of Lower House voting on Pension Reform would take place this week, ahead of the Congressional recess on 19 July; USDBRL now trades below 3.8000. <strong>ZAR </strong>broke back below 14.00, gleaning some underlying support from news that SARB Governor Kganyago was reappointed for another five-year term; this is in stark contrast to the recent changes at the top of the CBRT, that Turkey President Erdogan on Wednesday said were due to the deposed head not complying with government instructions. Regardless, <strong>TRY </strong>was firmer on the day, but is yet to claw back last weekend’s losses, induced after CBRT independence effectively ended.</p>",

In wake of Powell’s testimony, money markets now price around 68bps of easing through the year end (it was around 51bps pre-Powell’s testimony). Crucially, the prospects of a double rate cut are being priced back in, after the markets priced them out in wake of the solid NFP report last week; markets now see an approximately 25% of a double cut – that had fallen to around 2.5% after the payrolls data. After the testimony, the US sold 10-year notes at 2.057%, a poor auction which tailed by 0.7bps, and on cover beneath recent averages. Dealers had the highest takedown since October 2018. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with the most notable steepening seen in 2s30s, which was greater than +11bps on the session.</p>",

Elsewhere in the EIA report, production ramped up to 12.3mln BPD from 12.2mln BPD, accompanied by +0.5% refinery utilisation (exp. +0.2%). Reports of oil majors in the Gulf of Mexico shuttering operations at Deepwater facilities due to weather warnings is also providing oil with vigour.

The bank also argues that it appears rich on the 2s10s curve due to the recent flattening seen in the last fortnight, and notes that the WI trades beneath all stop out rates since October 2016. With that said, the 10 current 10 trades special in repo, which could be supportive of demand. Additionally, the relatively low dealer holdings in the 7-11yrs sector might help to bring about firmer demand from dealers.</p>",

However, the catalyst for broad Dollar selling was a further dovish shift in the language regarding inflation as he warned that prices may be soft for longer than expected vs a transitory view prior to the June meeting. The index subsequently breached chart support at 97.312 (55 DMA) and Monday’s post-NFP retracement low on the way to 97.100 awaiting the verbal semi-annual testimony and Q&amp;A, with minutes to last month’s convene seemingly rather stale if not completely irrelevant. Bears will now be looking at 97.000 for obvious reasons and then 96.875 before the mtd trough at 96.592.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Options pricing proved pretty spot on in the event as the Loonie handed back all its post-Powell text gains vs its US peer and a bit more within a 1.3070-1.3143 range. In short, the BoC maintained rates as widely expected, but also underlined a neutral bias via omitting any reference to future policy again and stressed data contingency and especially the performance of the energy sector. However, the accompanying statement also noted increased downside threats to the Canadian economy via global tensions and Usd/Cad is now sitting roughly midway between extremes ahead of the post-meeting press conference from BoC Governor Poloz and senior assistant Wilkins.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi’s comeback from deep overnight lows that seem to have been triggered by stops and perhaps even an erroneous or fat finger trade continued amidst the widespread Buck downturn noted above, with Nzd/Usd flying through huge option expiries at 0.6610 well before the NY cut and reaching 0.6650+ at one stage. Similarly, the Aussie reclaimed 0.6950+ status, albeit from a shallower base around 0.6911 and briefly under a Fib (at 0.6915) at the expense of its US counterpart (or courtesy of), while the Aud/Nzd cross retreated back below 1.0500 after also seeing stop-buying when the Kiwi collapsed.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>All beneficiaries of the Usd reversal, as well as some specific/independent positive factors with the single currency climbing from just over 1.1200 after significantly stronger than forecast French ip data and maintaining momentum on a firmer rebound in Italian industrial output, but not clearing 1.1233 (55 DMA) or triggering 1.2240+ stops until Powell gave Eur/Usd another boost to 1.1255. Meanwhile, the already perky Franc pierced 0.9900 and Cable crossed 1.2500 temporarily following a UK data raft revealing some encouraging or less worrying GDP developments. The Yen has extended its recovery from near 109.00 troughs to a 108.50 peak, but no further to arouse 1 bn expiry interest at 108.25-20.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Amidst general gains vs the Dollar, Brazil’s Real got another Pension Reform related boost ahead of lower house voting today and the second round pencilled in for Friday, while SA’s Rand gleaned some underlying support from news that SARB Governor Kganyago was reappointed for another 5 year term by President Ramaphosa in stark contrast to the enforced changes at the CBRT that Turkey’s Erdogan said were due to deposed head not complying with instructions. Usd/Brl hovering around 3.7700 and Usd/Zar circa 14.6000.</p>",

All US benchmarks are now back above par and the 10 year yield has retreated to sub-2.05% from 2.1%+ at one stage, while Bunds are back over 172.60 vs 172.02 at worst and Gilts have rebounded to a new Liffe session high at 131.51 (-19 ticks vs -81 ticks at the other extreme). Conversely, the Greenback has been flogged across the board, with the DXY down to 97.100 and just under this week’s prior base.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Minutes to the FOMC’s June meeting might be overshadowed by the timelier dual-testimonies that Fed Chair Powell will deliver to lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday. However, traders will look to both Powell’s remarks and the meeting minutes to gauge not only the prospects of a 25bps/50bps rate cut at the July meeting, but also the trajectory of the Fed’s rate path through to the end of the year. The markets have priced out the prospects of the ‘double’ rate cut after a solid employment situation report last week; however, other risks, especially prices and global growth, could still give the FOMC optionality to loosen policy. The minutes will be released at 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 10th July 2019.

Once again, the Dax (-0.4%) is underperforming its peers, though not to the same extent as in the prior session, as BASF (-0.7%) continues to weigh after yesterdays profit warning as does Bayer (-1.0%) after the Co. state they are continuing, and on track with exiting the animal health business. Sectors are mixed with the notable outperformers being Energy names, in-line with the broader complex following yesterdays larger then expected API draw, while the Financial sector is also benefitting from some consolidation in Deutsche Bank after the Co’s restructuring plans were unveiled over the weekend (+2.1%), with other banking names being lifted as well this morning. As such, the FTSE MIB (+0.5%) is leading the bourses this morning with gains in the index stemming from strong Italian banking names this morning. Elsewhere, European semiconductors have benefitted from Taiwan Semiconductor’s strong monthly sales with the likes of Infineon (+2.0%), and STMicroelectronics (+2.2%) benefitting.</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar is somewhat softer vs G10 counterparts on balance as the clock ticks down to the first semi-annual testimony from Fed Chair Powell and minutes to June’s FOMC policy meeting that in theory should be relatively redundant barring any major revelations that supplement or contradict the tone of his text and Q&amp;A. The DXY just dipped under 97.350 and close to technical support around 97.312 (55 DMA) having held below/respected daily chart resistance at 97.680 yesterday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/EUR -</strong> The major outperformers, albeit marginal, with Usd/Chf drifting back down towards 0.9900 and the Franc also outpacing the Euro within a 1.1140-20 range despite some rare Eurozone data beats via French and Italian ip that have underpinned the single currency in Usd terms, but not threatened stops said to be in place on a break of 1.1240 or the 55 DMA (1.1233). Meanwhile, the Pound has rebounded a bit more firmly from another test of early 2019 ‘flash crash’ lows against the Buck and 0.9000+ vs the Euro in the wake of a raft of UK data, as firmer than forecast 3 month rolling and y/y GDP prints appear to have overshadowed misses in other metrics. Cable is nudging back up towards 1.2500, but could be capped by some option expiry interest spanning 1.2495 and the big figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD</strong> - The Loonie has bounced from recent lows vs its US peer against the backdrop of firm oil prices, but more in anticipation that the BoC will retain a hawkish stance or bias in comparison to the Fed chair. Usd/Cad has eased back towards 1.3100 with options indicating a 75 pip break-even for the policy pronouncements that coincide with Powell’s presentation, although his text will be released at 13.30BST and for previews of both events see the Ransquawk Research Suite. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has staged an even more impressive recovery from what looks to have been a stop-driven plunge overnight through 0.6600 vs the Greenback to circa 0.6570, and the allure of mega expiries at 0.6610 may well be the catalyst as 2.4 bn rolls off at the NY cut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/NOK -</strong> All on the defensive, as the Aussie only just survived a test of 0.6900 with the aid of cross-winds from the aforementioned Kiwi nosedive and Aud/Nzd reclaiming 1.0500+ status before reversing again, while the Yen got to within 2 pips of 109.00, but is now off worst levels as offers at the big figure remained untouched and hefty expiry interest (1.7 bn at the strike) also kept the headline pair in check. The Norwegian Krona weakened in wake of softer than expected inflation data, but Eur/Nok pulled up just shy of a key chart level in the form of the 100 DMA at 9.7147.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Mxn remains under pressure following the resignation of Mexico’s Finance Minister and not far from 19.2000+ lows vs the Usd, while Usd/Try rallied to 5.7500+ peaks amidst more Turkish intransigence on its drilling activities and S-400 missile order that have rattled relations with the EU and US respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence Index (Jul) 96.5 (Prev. 100.7); 2-year low. (Newswires)</p><p>Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence (Jul) M/M -4.1% (Prev. -0.6%)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The great debt retracement continues, as Bunds reverse over 2 full points from contract pinnacle to 172.02 in wake of a meek 10 year German auction despite a healthy looking concession and Gilts breach sub-131.00 support on the back of better than feared UK GDP data before finding bids at 130.89. Meanwhile, French OATs have extended their post-ip losses to 100+ ticks and Italian BTPs only derived fleeting encouragement from a better than expected recovery in output. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have been dragged down further in contagion and caution ahead of Fed chair Powell, with the curve steeper in advance of the 2nd slug of supply and a rather tepid reception for 3s on Tuesday, although the 10 year offering around 2.10% may be more attractive.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent are firmer on the day and currently just below session highs</strong>, with WTI remaining around the USD 59.00/bbl level after the complex benefitted from the larger than expected headline API draw last night at -8.129mln vs. Exp. -3.1mln, with participants now looking to today’s EIA release for confirmation of this. An additional factor for this mornings upside is the ongoing weather situation in the Gulf of Mexico, where the NHC are currently stating that there is a 90% chance of a cyclone forming within the next 48 hours; as such multiple production platforms have begun evacuating workers and shutting production. As a reference point, the Gulf of Mexico accounts for around 15% of the US’s total production.</p><p><strong>Gold (-0.2%)</strong> remains capped below the USD 1400/oz level and has thus-far failed to benefit from the mild dollar weakness as participants await Fed Chair Powell’s testimony and the FOMC minutes later in the session. Elsewhere, a Brazilian court has ruled that Vale must remedy all damages from January’s dam collapse, with no monetary value being set as the judge did not believe it is yet possible to quantify the compensation figure.</p><p><strong>BHP, BP, Chevron and Shell began evacuating staff and shutting in production at offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico as a precaution</strong>, while NHC said that there is a 90% chance of a cyclone formation in the next 48 hours in the north-eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Once again, the Dax (-0.4%) is underperforming its peers, though not to the same extent as in the prior session, as BASF (-0.7%) continues to weigh after yesterdays profit warning as does Bayer (-1.0%) after the Co. state they are continuing, and on track with exiting the animal health business. Sectors are mixed with the notable outperformers being Energy names, in-line with the broader complex following yesterdays larger then expected API draw, while the Financial sector is also benefitting from some consolidation in Deutsche Bank after the Co’s restructuring plans were unveiled over the weekend (+2.1%), with other banking names being lifted as well this morning. As such, the FTSE MIB (+0.5%) is leading the bourses this morning with gains in the index stemming from strong Italian banking names this morning. Elsewhere, European semiconductors have benefitted from Taiwan Semiconductor’s strong monthly sales with the likes of Infineon (+2.0%), and STMicroelectronics (+2.2%) benefitting.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar is somewhat softer vs G10 counterparts on balance as the clock ticks down to the first semi-annual testimony from Fed Chair Powell and minutes to June’s FOMC policy meeting that in theory should be relatively redundant barring any major revelations that supplement or contradict the tone of his text and Q&amp;A. The DXY just dipped under 97.350 and close to technical support around 97.312 (55 DMA) having held below/respected daily chart resistance at 97.680 yesterday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/EUR -</strong> The major outperformers, albeit marginal, with Usd/Chf drifting back down towards 0.9900 and the Franc also outpacing the Euro within a 1.1140-20 range despite some rare Eurozone data beats via French and Italian ip that have underpinned the single currency in Usd terms, but not threatened stops said to be in place on a break of 1.1240 or the 55 DMA (1.1233). Meanwhile, the Pound has rebounded a bit more firmly from another test of early 2019 ‘flash crash’ lows against the Buck and 0.9000+ vs the Euro in the wake of a raft of UK data, as firmer than forecast 3 month rolling and y/y GDP prints appear to have overshadowed misses in other metrics. Cable is nudging back up towards 1.2500, but could be capped by some option expiry interest spanning 1.2495 and the big figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD</strong> - The Loonie has bounced from recent lows vs its US peer against the backdrop of firm oil prices, but more in anticipation that the BoC will retain a hawkish stance or bias in comparison to the Fed chair. Usd/Cad has eased back towards 1.3100 with options indicating a 75 pip break-even for the policy pronouncements that coincide with Powell’s presentation, although his text will be released at 13.30BST and for previews of both events see the Ransquawk Research Suite. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has staged an even more impressive recovery from what looks to have been a stop-driven plunge overnight through 0.6600 vs the Greenback to circa 0.6570, and the allure of mega expiries at 0.6610 may well be the catalyst as 2.4 bn rolls off at the NY cut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/NOK -</strong> All on the defensive, as the Aussie only just survived a test of 0.6900 with the aid of cross-winds from the aforementioned Kiwi nosedive and Aud/Nzd reclaiming 1.0500+ status before reversing again, while the Yen got to within 2 pips of 109.00, but is now off worst levels as offers at the big figure remained untouched and hefty expiry interest (1.7 bn at the strike) also kept the headline pair in check. The Norwegian Krona weakened in wake of softer than expected inflation data, but Eur/Nok pulled up just shy of a key chart level in the form of the 100 DMA at 9.7147.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Mxn remains under pressure following the resignation of Mexico’s Finance Minister and not far from 19.2000+ lows vs the Usd, while Usd/Try rallied to 5.7500+ peaks amidst more Turkish intransigence on its drilling activities and S-400 missile order that have rattled relations with the EU and US respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>The great debt retracement continues, as Bunds reverse over 2 full points from contract pinnacle to 172.02 in wake of a meek 10 year German auction despite a healthy looking concession and Gilts breach sub-131.00 support on the back of better than feared UK GDP data before finding bids at 130.89. Meanwhile, French OATs have extended their post-ip losses to 100+ ticks and Italian BTPs only derived fleeting encouragement from a better than expected recovery in output. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have been dragged down further in contagion and caution ahead of Fed chair Powell, with the curve steeper in advance of the 2nd slug of supply and a rather tepid reception for 3s on Tuesday, although the 10 year offering around 2.10% may be more attractive.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent are firmer on the day and currently just below session highs</strong>, with WTI remaining around the USD 59.00/bbl level after the complex benefitted from the larger than expected headline API draw last night at -8.129mln vs. Exp. -3.1mln, with participants now looking to today’s EIA release for confirmation of this. An additional factor for this mornings upside is the ongoing weather situation in the Gulf of Mexico, where the NHC are currently stating that there is a 90% chance of a cyclone forming within the next 48 hours; as such multiple production platforms have begun evacuating workers and shutting production. As a reference point, the Gulf of Mexico accounts for around 15% of the US’s total production.</p><p><strong>Gold (-0.2%)</strong> remains capped below the USD 1400/oz level and has thus-far failed to benefit from the mild dollar weakness as participants await Fed Chair Powell’s testimony and the FOMC minutes later in the session. Elsewhere, a Brazilian court has ruled that Vale must remedy all damages from January’s dam collapse, with no monetary value being set as the judge did not believe it is yet possible to quantify the compensation figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A 'double' rate cut of 50bps at the July FOMC has been priced out, and the question, analysts say is what is the Fed's conviction of the trajectory of rates through to the end of the year; currently around 2.5 rate hikes are priced in by money markets by the end of 2019; the median Fed 'dot' sees rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Ahead of the Fedspeak, the US Treasury sold 3-year notes at 1.857%, the lowest high yield since November 2017; the sale stopped through the screens by 0.1bps. Cover was soft, the lowest since March 2019. The breakdown, meanwhile, saw indirect participation pare back (48.5% vs 56.6% prior), with direct participation rising to 17.9% from 13.4%, and dealers taking from 30.0% prior.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed following a similar lead from Wall St, as participants await fresh clues on Fed policy from the upcoming Fed Chair Powell congressional testimony and FOMC minutes release. ASX 200 (+0.5%) is led higher by outperformance in the tech sector and with financials rebounding from yesterday’s capital buffer pressure as S&amp;P provided more favourable outlooks on its credit ratings for the Big 4 banks, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) is indecisive with sentiment at the whim of a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) lack firm direction with initial upside seen after reports USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin conducted a phone call with China Vice Premier Liu He which was said have gone well and was constructive. However, the mainland briefly gave back the gains following liquidity outflows and as participants digest mixed inflation data in which PPI printed flat Y/Y which was softer than expected and lacked growth for the 1st time in nearly 3 years.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is rangebound and consolidates around the 97.50 level with price action tentative as all focus remains on Powell’s testimony and the FOMC minutes later, while its major counterparts are also uneventful in which EUR/USD just about holds on to the 1.1200 handle and with GBP/USD languishing around 1.2450 after having recently printed its lowest levels in more than 2 years. In terms of the latest Brexit-related headlines, Brexit Secretary Barclay warned the EU a no-deal Brexit will hurt Ireland more than Britain, and lawmakers narrowly voted in favour of a plan which may hinder the government from suspending Parliament if it pursues a no deal Brexit, although these reports failed to spur any sustained reaction in the currency. Elsewhere, USD/JPY largely reflects the indecisive risk tone although remains in close proximity to the 109.00 handle where there is a large option expiry of USD 1.8bln for today’s New York cut. Antipodeans are subdued with AUD/USD dampened after Westpac Consumer Confidence slipped to a 2yr low and due to the soft Chinese producer inflation data, while NZD/USD was erratic and dropped about 30 pips before paring the move with the initial spike lower attributed to stops being hit below the 0.6600 level and as AUD/NZD surged above 1.0500. Significant weakness was also seen in MXN during US trade with the currency pressured after the Mexican Finance Minister resigned citing conflicts of interests in the government and how administration decisions were made without sufficient backing, although the currency has since stabilized overnight.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as they tracked the downside in T-notes and amid the absence of BoJ from the market today.</p>",
