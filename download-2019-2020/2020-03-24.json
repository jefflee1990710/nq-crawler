(CNBC)</p><p>US stimulus talks could be delayed further amidst disagreements between Republicans and Democrats, with disagreement centering at present around agri assistance. (WSJ)</p><p>US NEC Director Kudlow said we may try to reopen parts of the economy around the end of the month, while Kudlow also said there is a clamor to get the economy to reopen and that the administration is looking at where this is possible. Kudlow added that President Trump 'wants to do something' to reopen the economy in the next two weeks and that the government may take warrants in companies receiving stimulus funds.

There appears to be no “one” factor behind the bounce back, or dead-cat bounce back if last Tuesday is anything to go by and depending on your market view. Some factors behind the bound included the stimulus bill looking set to be announced as early as Tuesday, a breather from the scramble for US Dollars, and general paring of the eye-gouging losses seen across global risk assets in recent weeks. Participants are now eager for a breakthrough of the stimulus bill, which reports suggest could come as early as Tuesday evening with lawmakers reportedly near an agreement for USD 25bln in grants for airlines; USD 4bln in grants for cargo carriers; USD 3bln in grants for airline contractors. Note, reports last week suggested the Trump administration was seeking proposals for roughly USD 50bln in aid, while CNN noted the Industry group Airlines for America was requesting a USD 50bln aid package from the government. SPX +9.38% at 2447, NDX +7.81% at 7554, DJIA +11.37% at 20705.</p><p>TREASURIES WERE OFFERED MOST ACUTELY IN THE FRONT TO BELLY amid a chunky return rally in the equity complex. The market is expecting Congress to come together (within hours?) on a stimulus package, which has supported risk appetite on Tuesday, as well as increasing the certainty of a deluge of supply for government bond investors to digest. The Fed continues to be an active participant across the curve, providing some support in afternoon trade with its Treasury and MBS purchases post its “QE Infinity” announcement on Monday. Elsewhere, in the US 2-year auction, USD 40bln was sold, tailing the 0.39% WI by 0.8bps, with dealers taken a larger than average share. By settlement, looking across the curve, 2s5s +3bps, 2s10s -2bps, 2s30s -4bps; 2-year +9.5bps, 10-year +7bps, 30-year +3.5bps. T-note (M0) futures settled 24 ticks lower at 137-14+.</p>",

Speakers: RBA’s Bullock. Supply: US</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Equities spiked higher on Tuesday following several sessions of heavy selling, where US futures hit their limit up in the overnight session and continued on their course after the cash open – the largest ever buy programme, covering 1880 names, was reported to have been executed at the NYSE open. There appears to be no “one” factor behind the bounce back, or dead-cat bounce back if last Tuesday is anything to go by and depending on your market view. Some factors behind the bound included the stimulus bill looking set to be announced as early as Tuesday, a breather from the scramble for US Dollars, and general paring of the eye-gouging losses seen across global risk assets in recent weeks. Participants are now eager for the completion of the stimulus bill, which reports suggest could come as early as Tuesday evening.</p><h2>CASE COUNT</h2><p><strong>415,113 WORLDWIDE CASES, 18,559 DEATHS, 108,294 RECOVERED</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Tuesday (via worldometer website) against Monday:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; CHINA total cases 81,171 (prev. 81,093), death toll 3,277 (prev. 3,270).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; ITALY total cases 69,176 (prev. 63,927), death toll 6,820 (prev. 6,077).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; US total cases 51,737 (prev. 43,734), death toll 667 (prev. 553).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; SPAIN total cases 39,676 (prev. 35,136), death toll 2,800 (prev. 2,311).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; GERMANY total cases 32,781 (prev. 24,873), death toll 156 (prev. 94).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; FRANCE total cases 22,304 (prev. 19,856), death toll 1,100 (prev. 860).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; SWITZERLAND total cases 9,117 (prev. 8,795), death toll 122 (prev. 120).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; SOUTH KOREA total cases 9,037 (prev. 8,961), death toll 120 (prev. 111).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; UK total cases 8,077 (prev. 6,650), death toll 422 (prev. 335).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; NETHERLANDS total cases 5,560 (prev. 4,749), death toll 276 (prev. 213).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; CANADA total cases 2,583 (prev. 2,091), death toll 25 (prev. 24).</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> US President Trump said we will have an announcement soon as to the timing of measures to ease coronavirus, while he added that the US will open up for business sooner than 3-4 months and that the stimulus bill is still needed because coronavirus has had a big impact on US economy even if the US reopens. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Senate Democrat leader Schumer were both optimistic about a deal being reached on Tuesday, where negotiators noted progress, although some issues were still under review in talks, while House Speaker Pelosi expressed her optimism on a deal being reached on Tuesday, too. As it stands, reports suggest that a deal over the bill should be reached by “sunset” Tuesday. Overnight the Democrats introduced their revised version of the package, a USD 2.5tln stimulus bill which was said to include USD 1,500 direct payment to citizens, USD 150bln health care appropriations (plus USD 80bln loans), USD 600/week unemployment benefit for virus-affected, as well as USD 215bln of state and local funds. Later reports, following negotiations in Congress, suggest the bill will give any SMEs, with up to 10K employees, a guaranteed low-interest loan that can be used to pay employees and keep operations in place. Elsewhere, Trump is to use funds from the Defense Production Act for producing coronavirus test kits and supporting other needed medical equipment.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>US President Trump, in a call with investment professionals, reportedly walked back on remarks that he wants the lockdown to end by Easter, instead suggesting that he wants them over as soon as possible, that could be beyond Easter, FBN<strong> </strong>reported.<strong> </strong>US VP Pence stressed that at no point has the White House COVID-19 Task Force discussed a nationwide lockdown, Fox reported. A US General said COVID-19 could last until July based on the experience of other countries. Washington state announced the closure of all businesses within 48 hours, while there were separate reports of comments from the California state Governor that the stay at home order could last 8-12 weeks. Washington, DC said it was closing non-essential businesses.</p><h2>REST OF WORLD</h2><p><strong>G7 </strong>Finance Ministers said they are taking action and enhancing coordination on domestic and international policy efforts to respond to COVID-19, will do \"whatever is necessary\".

On this, German Finance Minister Scholz said Germany is ready to mull a post-virus stimulus package for the country, but talks are at \"a very early stage\"; later said the government is looking into whether tax-free additional payments for some workers is a possibility during the crisis.</p><p><strong>ITALY </strong>COVID-19 cases are 10x higher than reported, La Republica reported. Elsewhere, Italy is reportedly considering a new EUR 18bln stimulus package for the coronavirus, Il Sole reported. Furthermore, Italy's petrol stations will begin to close, including motorway pumps, from Wednesday. Italy PM Conte proposed fines worth between EUR 400-3,000 for those defying lockdown orders; rejected reports that the government plans to extend the lockdown until July 31st, expects the curb to be lifted well before then.</p><p><strong>UK CHANCELLOR SUNAK</strong> said there will be further announcements for the self-employed (follows criticism that recent measures exclude such). Sunak also said, depending on their status, zero-hour contract staff could be eligible for a job retention scheme. The Chancellor added it is not possible to design a scheme for those on flexible hours; not in favour of a universal basic income. Later, Sky News reported that the package for the self-employed probably will not be complete by Wednesday, but will be done by the end of the week, as it is proving more difficult than expected.</p><p><strong>WHO </strong>spokesperson expects the virus death toll to increase significantly, as further cases are reported to the WHO; 85% of cases in EU or US over the past 24 hours are seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the US, has the potential to be the virus epicentre.</p><p><strong>CHINA: </strong>China's Hubei province, where the pandemic is thought to have originated, plans to lift travel restrictions on 8th April – ten weeks after they were first imposed.</p><p><strong>SOUTH KOREA</strong> President Moon unveiled plans to double the size of the emergency-financing aid package to KRW 100tln, while they will set up KRW 10.7tln equity market stabilization fund and KRW 20tln bond stabilization fund.</p><p><strong>INDIA</strong> is to impose a nationwide lockdown from midnight, according to PM Modi.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP </strong>commented that the Fed has done a good job and suggested that Fed Chair Powell has plenty of arrows.</p><p><strong>ECB'S VILLEROY</strong> said the ECB is to enter the commercial paper market this week, possibly as soon as Wednesday; ECB intends to be 'operational fair and significant' actor in such interaction.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.65 HIGHER AT USD 24.01/BBL; BRENT (K20) SETTLED USD 0.12 HIGHER AT USD 27.15/BBL</strong></p><p>The crude complex was lower on Tuesday despite improved risk appetite in other asset classes. WTI slightly lower after heavy volatility in recent sessions with WTI trading between USD 23-25+/bbl today with no signs of an increase in demand from the West as participants are wary of any further travel restrictions while airlines continue to seek aid and are expecting further cuts to its capacity. RBC highlights US gasoline is the world’s largest demand-side swing factors, and after tracking real-time traffic congestion in 10 heavily trafficked cities, it found congestion has fallen by 76% from the normal rate and thus believes “global demand destruction ebbs and flows in the 8 to 11mb/d range over the near term”. Brent traded lower, just beneath USD 27/bbl heading into settlement, a lack of updates on the Saudi/Russia front, although comments from the head of Russia’s Tatneft stated it makes little sense to increase output next month given the hit to demand. On the corporate side, Chevron (CVX) announced it is reducing Capex guidance by 20% (USD 4bln) and is suspending its USD 5bln annual share repurchase programme, but has no plans to cut its dividend. It also added the impact of COVID-19 is expected to negatively impact its future financial operating results, while it is also cutting 8 rigs in the Permian Basin. Halliburton (HAL) stated rigs could drop by as much as 65% by Q420 and Phillips 66 (PSX) is currently running near minimum crude rates at its refineries. Citi highlights that actions taken by Shale producers is only having a limited effect on the market surplus, noting “Spending cuts will mean declining US oil production from a likely 2Q peak, but this may be more than offset by refinery run cuts to cope with falling product demand. Negative gasoline margins in Europe and the US are still signaling the need for deeper reductions”. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories, with private data reporting later on Tuesday, expectations (bbls) are for crude stocks +2.8mln, gasoline -1.4mln and distillates -1.9mln.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 24 TICKS LOWER AT 137-14+.</strong></p><p><strong>TREASURIES WERE OFFERED MOST ACUTELY IN THE FRONT TO BELLY </strong>amid a chunky return rally in the equity complex. The market is expecting Congress to come together (within hours?) on a stimulus package, which has supported risk appetite on Tuesday, as well as increasing the certainty of a deluge of supply for government bond investors to digest. The Fed continues to be an active participant across the curve, providing some support in afternoon trade with its Treasury and MBS purchases post its “QE Infinity” announcement on Monday. Elsewhere, in the US 2-year auction, USD 40bln was sold, tailing the 0.39% WI by 0.8bps, with dealers taken a larger than average share.

Note, reports last week suggested the Trump administration was seeking proposals for roughly USD 50bln in aid, while CNN noted the Industry group Airlines for America was requesting a USD 50bln aid package from the government. Within the sector, Delta Airlines (DAL) were cut to Junk by S&amp;P; a sign of worry for the sector. Meanwhile, the IATA head economist expects airline capacity to be down 90% in Europe in Q2 20 and the head of IATA stated over half of the airlines could go bust in the coming weeks if there is no assistance. WSJ also reported US Airlines are rafting plans for a voluntary shutdown of almost all passenger flights across the US as the government is also mulling such a move amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Boeing (BA) saw hefty gain once again continuing its post-Goldman Sachs upgrade rally from yesterday after comments from its CEO that it has ample liquidity (in fitting with GS comments yesterday) and the situation in China is normalising, as well as saying 737 MAX will return \"mid-year\", as per its original view. Elsewhere, Chevron (CVX) cut CapEx guidance and suspended its share repurchase programme, it noted it has no plans to cut its dividend. Ford (F) no longer plans to re-open its US, Canada, and Mexico plants by March 30th. IHS Markit (INFO) surged after top and bottom-line beats accompanied by optimistic comments from its CEO.&nbsp; Intel (INTC) was upgraded t Neutral from Sell at Goldman Sachs; PT USD 54 (Prev. PT USD 55, Prev. closing price 49.58/shr) in a research note where the analyst, Toshiya Hari, stated despite COVID-19 headwinds, it has multiple near term positive development such as the potential resilience in the high-end client CPU markets as people are encouraged to work from home which could offset the headwinds of weaker consumption and spending from enterprises. INTC it is to also suspend its share repurchase programme due to COVID-19. Coca Cola (KO) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at HSBC, and AMD (AMD) and NVIDIA (NVDA) were added to Wedbush’s top ideas list. UBS downgraded Ford (F) but upgraded Tesla (TSLA), both to neutral.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>EU MARKIT PMI:</strong> The composite in the Eurozone fell deeper than expected to 31.4 (exp. Exp. 38.8) from 51.6 previously, although the decline was worse than expected, the manufacturing sector fared better although still fell to 44.8 (exp. 39) from 49.2, while services took a larger hit crashing to 28.4, deeper than the expected decline to 39 from 52.6. The decline confirms the sharp downturn in the EZ economy, ING writes, although it does not reveal the whole depth of the fallout. RBC highlight the survey took place between March 16 and 20, just as France and Spain were announcing lockdowns so it will not encapsulate to the whole effect, while noting Italy, the worst-hit EU country, is not included in the flash survey so the full impact will be seen in the final release. The report states the March PMI is indicative of GDP slumping at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and clearly, there’s scope for the downturn to intensify further as even more draconian policies to deal with the virus are potentially implemented in coming months. It added, “Demand for many goods and services has fallen dramatically, while near-record supply chain delays have stymied production and business closures mean an increasingly large proportion of the economy is being mothballed”. Germany fell to 37.2 from 50.7, deeper than expected while it noted “the underlying data for manufacturing output and new orders are some of the worst we’ve seen over the past decade, though not as bad as the service sector”. The report added, “The unprecedented collapse in the PMI underscores how Germany is headed for recession, and a steep one at that. The March data are indicative of GDP falling at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus outbreak mean we should be braced for the downturn to further intensify in the second quarter”. France also a dismal print, 30.2 (exp. 39.8, prev. 52), noting “Overall new orders placed with French businesses fell at the fastest pace in the series history. Registering a series record contraction, service providers again experienced a faster decline than manufacturers, despite the latter recording a considerable fall in new work”. It added, “March saw a record rate of declines for services activity, while the manufacturing sector suffered to the greatest extent since the global financial crisis. Taken together, these declines suggest GDP is collapsing at an annualised rate approaching double digits.</p><p><strong>US NEW HOME SALES:</strong> New home sales fell to 0.765mln from a previously revised 0.8mln (+60k), although it was ever so slightly above expectations. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlight the winter market was strong thanks to a longer period than usual of mild weather. The consultancy states it would have expected further gains through spring due to the low rates and strong labour market but the lockdowns and job losses means activity will fall in March and even further in April, but it expects a stronger print by June; dependent on the coronavirus. PM concludes with “On the plus side, this is not 2007, and inventory is very tight, so we don’t expect to see home prices immediately rollover”.</p><p><strong>US MARKIT PMI:</strong> The headline fell to 40.5 from 49.6 printing a new series low, even though it was buoyed by longer supply delivery times. The Services Business Activity Index also hit a series low falling to 39.1 from 49.4 last month, the first contraction of new business since data began. Manufacturing PMI and output index saw the sharpest drop since 2009 at 49.2 (prev. 50.7) and 47.6 (prev. 50.7), respectively. Steep rates of contraction were signalled for production and new orders, both of which fell to the greatest extent since 2009, with many firms linking this to the escalation of preventative measures following the outbreak of COVID-19. Some companies have reported having to shut down and give refunds where orders could not be fulfilled in time. Firms reduced workforce numbers at the fastest pace since 2009 and it also indicated a weakening of inflationary pressures. However, companies were generally optimistic that business activity would increase over the coming year. However, the degree of business confidence was by far the lowest ever recorded by the survey, as firms expressed concerns regarding the longevity of shutdowns and the ongoing impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The survey underscores how the US is likely already in a recession that will inevitably deepen further. The March PMI is roughly indicative of GDP falling at an annualised rate approaching 5%, but the increasing number of virus-fighting lockdowns and closures mean the second quarter will likely see a far steeper rate of decline.”</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> Another down day for dollar with DXY falling back beneath 102 to lows just above 101.04 in early trade, although reclaimed the figure in late trade despite dismal PMI data (although it was largely expected). New Home Sales were ever so slightly firmer than expected, but still fell from the heavily revised higher prior but data has very much taken the back seat given current market conditions. The buck regained the majority of lost ground while yields rise on the broader risk environment and as the Senate leaned ever closer to an agreement on its coronavirus bill, with expectations for the bill to pass later on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable saw solid gains despite the PM imposing a lockdown last night as many had expected was more or less imminent amid a flurry of rumours. Cable rose from 1.1511 at the lows to find resistance within a whisker of 1.18. Lloyd’s highlight that momentum studies are still in unwind mode from being oversold, stating a rally through 1.1935 then 1.2060 is needed to show signs of a broader recovery back above 1.2350. The bank notes that if this does not happen, sideways price action means that downside risks still remain, and it could head towards support beneath at 1.1110-1.1080 before the psychological 1.10.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Lloyd’s suggest a rally through 1.0865-1.0935 resistance would suggest a broader recovery in the cross can develop. EURUSD continued to rise despite a weaker than expected Markit PMI data. However, the manufacturing print fell less than expected while services were particularly hit. RBC highlight the survey took place between March 16 and 20, just as France and Spain were announcing lockdowns so it will not encapsulate to whole effect, while noting Italy, the worst-hit EU country, is not included in the flash survey so the full impact will be seen in the final release. Also, the dismal prints were to be expected given the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> Continued to gain and crossed back above the USD 1600 mark after previous week’s decline which saw the precious metal beneath 1500 just over a week ago due to the unprecedented demand for dollars which saw participants rotate out of typical havens (tsys, gold) to dollars to help with funding. This week, however, has seen a reversal of the majority of the declines as the precious metal perhaps as some signs of USD liquidity issues are easing, desks yesterday highlighted the tightening of currency basis swaps as a positive sign after the Fed’s measures. Note, London’s Bullion Market association stated there is some impact on liquidity arising from price volatility in Comex 100 oz futures.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> USDJPY traded firmer and traded around and saw highs around 111.60 before remaining just off highs heading into AsiaPac trade. USDJPY largely followed moves in US equities which saw a hefty rebound from the prior day’s steep losses, desks also highlight the inverse relationship the cross holds with the VIX given its haven status. Desks also noticing a pullback in volatility after global policy responses from both the fiscal side and monetary, although most of the volatility pullback can be put down to the Fed’s latest stimulus measures.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie currently flat against the buck, although traded within 1.4375-1.4532 parameters and is towards the top end of the parameters, initial strength was seen amid better risk appetite and higher oil prices, although weakened as gains were capped in the energy complex and, as Scotia note,&nbsp; by the prospect of a virtual shutdown to try limit the coronavirus spread. Scotiabank writes the “Government and Bank of Canada action to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has been aggressive but provides little protection for the CAD. We expect the CAD to continue to trade in line with the broader risk mood for now”.</p><p><strong>Antipodes:</strong> Both traded firmer amid broader risk sentiment while the AUD outperformed amid further liquidity injections from the RBA as AUDUSD found highs at 0.5974 from lows of 0.5813. Aussie PMI data saw a similar trend to EU where manufacturing fared well whereas services slumped. NZD slightly weaker than the AUD amid comments from New Zealand’s finance minister who stated the RBNZ can do more QE and use other tools. NZ trade data is out tonight, although it is for February so it will not encapsulate the whole COVID effect.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> All benefited from broader risk sentiment while RUB and MXN also benefitted from firmer oil prices. Mexico's inflation data was more or less inline but had little impact on the Peso. BRL also firmer despite worse than expected retail sales and consumer confidence data as the risk environment drives price action in emerging markets today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>USD:</strong> Another down day for dollar with DXY falling back beneath 102 to lows just above 101.04 in early trade, although reclaimed the figure in late trade despite dismal PMI data (although it was largely expected). New Home Sales were ever so slightly firmer than expected, but still fell from the heavily revised higher prior but data has very much taken the back seat given current market conditions. The buck regained the majority of lost ground while yields rise on the broader risk environment and as the Senate leaned ever closer to an agreement on its coronavirus bill, with expectations for the bill to pass later on Tuesday.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable saw solid gains despite the PM imposing a lockdown last night as many had expected was more or less imminent amid a flurry of rumours. Cable rose from 1.1511 at the lows to find resistance within a whisker of 1.18. Lloyd’s highlight that momentum studies are still in unwind mode from being oversold, stating a rally through 1.1935 then 1.2060 is needed to show signs of a broader recovery back above 1.2350. The bank notes that if this does not happen, sideways price action means that downside risks still remain, and it could head towards support beneath at 1.1110-1.1080 before the psychological 1.10.</li><li><strong>EUR:</strong> Lloyd’s suggest a rally through 1.0865-1.0935 resistance would suggest a broader recovery in the cross can develop. EURUSD continued to rise despite a weaker than expected Markit PMI data. However, the manufacturing print fell less than expected while services were particularly hit. RBC highlight the survey took place between March 16 and 20, just as France and Spain were announcing lockdowns so it will not encapsulate to whole effect, while noting Italy, the worst-hit EU country, is not included in the flash survey so the full impact will be seen in the final release. Also, the dismal prints were to be expected given the coronavirus pandemic.</li><li><strong>XAU:</strong> Continued to gain and crossed back above the USD 1600 mark after previous week’s decline which saw the precious metal beneath 1500 just over a week ago due to the unprecedented demand for dollars which saw participants rotate out of typical havens (tsys, gold) to dollars to help with funding. This week, however, has seen a reversal of the majority of the declines as the precious metal perhaps as some signs of USD liquidity issues are easing, desks yesterday highlighted the tightening of currency basis swaps as a positive sign after the Fed’s measures. Note, London’s Bullion Market association stated there is some impact on liquidity arising from price volatility in Comex 100 oz futures.</li><li><strong>JPY:</strong> USDJPY traded firmer and traded around and saw highs around 111.60 before remaining just off highs heading into AsiaPac trade. USDJPY largely followed moves in US equities which saw a hefty rebound from the prior day’s steep losses, desks also highlight the inverse relationship the cross holds with the VIX given its haven status. Desks also noticing a pullback in volatility after global policy responses from both the fiscal side and monetary, although most of the volatility pullback can be put down to the Fed’s latest stimulus measures.</li><li><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie currently flat against the buck, although traded within 1.4375-1.4532 parameters and is towards the top end of the parameters, initial strength was seen amid better risk appetite and higher oil prices, although weakened as gains were capped in the energy complex and, as Scotia note,&nbsp; by the prospect of a virtual shutdown to try limit the coronavirus spread. Scotiabank writes the “Government and Bank of Canada action to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has been aggressive but provides little protection for the CAD. We expect the CAD to continue to trade in line with the broader risk mood for now”.</li><li><strong>Antipodes:</strong> Both traded firmer amid broader risk sentiment while the AUD outperformed amid further liquidity injections from the RBA as AUDUSD found highs at 0.5974 from lows of 0.5813. Aussie PMI data saw a similar trend to EU where manufacturing fared well whereas services slumped. NZD slightly weaker than the AUD amid comments from New Zealand’s finance minister who stated the RBNZ can do more QE and use other tools. NZ trade data is out tonight, although it is for February so it will not encapsulate the whole COVID effect.</li><li><strong>EMFX:</strong> All benefited from broader risk sentiment while RUB and MXN also benefitted from firmer oil prices. Mexico's inflation data was more or less inline but had little impact on the Peso. BRL also firmer despite worse than expected retail sales and consumer confidence data as the risk environment drives price action in emerging markets today.</li></ul>",

The Fed continues to be an active participant across the curve, providing some support in afternoon trade with its Treasury and MBS purchases post its “QE Infinity” announcement on Monday. Elsewhere, in the US 2-year auction, USD 40bln was sold, tailing the 0.39% WI by 0.8bps, with dealers taken a larger than average share.

WTI slightly lower after heavy volatility in recent sessions with WTI trading between USD 23-25+/bbl today with no signs of an increase in demand from the West as participants are wary of any further travel restrictions while airlines continue to seek aid and are expecting further cuts to its capacity. RBC highlights US gasoline is the world’s largest demand-side swing factors, and after tracking real-time traffic congestion in 10 heavily trafficked cities, it found congestion has fallen by 76% from the normal rate and thus believes “global demand destruction ebbs and flows in the 8 to 11mb/d range over the near term”. Brent traded lower, just beneath USD 27/bbl heading into settlement, a lack of updates on the Saudi/Russia front, although comments from the head of Russia’s Tatneft stated it makes little sense to increase output next month given the hit to demand. On the corporate side, Chevron (CVX) announced it is reducing Capex guidance by 20% (USD 4bln) and is suspending its USD 5bln annual share repurchase programme, but has no plans to cut its dividend. It also added the impact of COVID-19 is expected to negatively impact its future financial operating results, while it is also cutting 8 rigs in the Permian Basin. Halliburton (HAL) stated rigs could drop by as much as 65% by Q420 and Phillips 66 (PSX) is currently running near minimum crude rates at its refineries. Citi highlights that actions taken by Shale producers is only having a limited effect on the market surplus, noting “Spending cuts will mean declining US oil production from a likely 2Q peak, but this may be more than offset by refinery run cuts to cope with falling product demand. Negative gasoline margins in Europe and the US are still signaling the need for deeper reductions”. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories, with private data reporting later on Tuesday, expectations (bbls) are for crude stocks +2.8mln, gasoline -1.4mln and distillates -1.9mln.</li></ul>",

All eyes now trained on Washington to see if Congress can find common ground on the remaining sticking points between Republicans and Democrats regarding fresh fiscal stimulus.</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has managed to consolidate around 0.5950 after breaching resistance in the 0.5887-0.5930 area amidst the general revival in risk appetite and another liquidity injection for banks from the RBA, while the Pound has proffered from the aforementioned softer Greenback and the Euro’s inability to take full advantage, with Cable approaching 1.1800 again and Eur/Gbp hovering around 0.9150 vs circa 0.9325 at one stage. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is just shy of 0.5800 ahead of NZ trade data for February that will not be nCoV infected anywhere near as much as the metrics from this month onwards.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs the Usd, but well off best levels reached in the first half of EU trade when the single currency was eyeing 1.0900 with the aid of bullish Eur/Jpy cross impulses (100 and 200 DMAs cleared) and not unduly ruffled by dire Eurozone PMIs. Elsewhere, the Franc is holding within a 0.9720-0.9850 range and Loonie between 1.4375-1.4532 parameters against the backdrop of choppy crude prices in advance of the API inventory update and mounting speculation that the BoC may be next to have to supplement emergency easing with QE.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The major loser and victim of the aforementioned return to risk-on positioning, as Usd/Jpy nudges 111.50 and chart resistance at recent highs.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Nok has extended its strong rebound And outperformance against the Sek on increasingly constructive technical grounds compounded by the prospect that the Norges Bank could intervene having slashed the benchmark depo rate to 0.25%, especially as Norway’s Labour Agency estimates that the jobless rate has spiked to 10.9% from only 5.3% a week ago. Similarly, EMs are largely on a firmer footing, but the Huf failed to derive much from the NBH bucking the CE3 trend to stand pat on rates in favour of unleashing open-ended fixed rate loans for up to 5 years at favourable terms, while also suspending bank reserve requirements.</p>",

Nonetheless, US equity futures have performed better after-hours with the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA back above the 3k and 19k levels respectively following recent comments by President Trump who suggested that America will be open for business sooner than 3-4 months and as negotiators were said to be near a deal on the coronavirus stimulus bill. ASX 200 (+4.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+7.1%) rallied from the open with Australia led higher by gold miners after the precious metal surged above USD 1500/oz in the wake of the Fed’s QE bazooka, while SoftBank shares extended on the prior day’s outperformance and posted its largest intraday gain of more than 21% amid plans to offload USD 14bln of Alibaba shares. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+4.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.3%) joined in on the broad rebound with Hong Kong outperforming the mainland as participants also digested earnings releases which was the main catalyst for the biggest moving stocks. Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and attempted to reclaim the 152.00 level after the bull flattening seen in USTs in the aftermath of the Fed’s asset purchase announcement, while the enhanced liquidity auction for 2-20yr JGBs also attracted greater demand.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net nuetral on the day.

That being said, fundamentals remain relatively unchanged, with the demand prospect still looking bleak amidst economic activities coming to a halt and airlines indefinitely grounding flights. Meanwhile, the supply side fares no better as Russia and Saudi still remain poised to hike production next month and with Moscow’s meeting with oil executives seemingly bearing no fruits. On that front, Energyintel understands that the Russian Energy Ministry will be convening with energy CEOs on a weekly basis, although no production curtailments were discussed at yesterday’s confab.

As a result, the <strong>DXY </strong>has pulled back from another test of resistance around the 103.00 level to the benefit of G10 peers and other currencies that depreciated markedly when credit conditions were ultra-tight and assets were being dumped in the dash for cash. Even extremely weak preliminary PMIs have not hampered the recovery against the Buck ahead of the looming US Markit surveys, housing data and a speech from Fed’s Bullard.</p><p>AUD/GBP/NZD/EUR/CHF/CAD/JPY</p><p>As noted above, the receding Usd has helped rival majors nurse losses as the Aussie reclaims 0.5900+ status with an independent impetus from more RBA funding for the banking sector overnight, while Cable is back within striking distance of 1.1800 irrespective of deep sub-50 UK PMIs and Britain now in a virtual 3 week COVID-19 lockdown. Back down under, the Kiwi has rebounded from just shy of 0.5700 towards 0.5850 following NZ Government and RBNZ business finance guarantees and reduced core bank funding ratios. The Euro is hovering close to decent 1.1 bn option expiry interest at 1.0860, and again not unduly unsettled by worrying French, German and pan Eurozone PMIs even though the periphery is almost certain to lead to downgrades in the final reckoning, with the Franc pivoting 0.9750, Loonie back above 1.4400 amidst firmer crude prices and Yen straddling 110.50, but sharply lagging Gold that has breached the Usd1600/oz mark.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad revivals courtesy of the aforementioned Dollar downturn and associated commodity comeback, as the Forint waits to see if the NBH cuts rates to make it a complete set of CE3 easing this month – March policy call due at 13.00GMT.</p>",

The measures may unlock unlimited ECB government bond buying, Reuters reported. One issue is the size of the fund, which was created to respond to asymmetric economic shocks, whereas covid is a symmetric shock which impacts all member states, Dombrovskis said; he emphasised the importance of a dedicated ESM tool which could unlock the ECB’s OMT programme to potentially buy an unlimited about of government bonds at primary auctions, since there is a fear that the ESM’s resources – which currently involve credit lines to governments – might still not be enough. To provide these credit lines, the ESM would need to borrow cheaply via “coronabonds” issuance. The EC VP also said the Commission will propose a European unemployment re-insurance scheme based on loans, since any economic fallout from covid would likely see a sharp rise in joblessness, though this would be presented in Q4.</li></ul>",

Nonetheless, US equity futures have performed better after-hours with the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA back above the 3k and 19k levels respectively following recent comments by President Trump who suggested that America will be open for business sooner than 3-4 months and as negotiators were said to be near a deal on the coronavirus stimulus bill.

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+3.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) joined in on the broad rebound with Hong Kong outperforming the mainland as participants also digested earnings releases which was the main catalyst for the biggest moving stocks. Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and attempted to reclaim the 152.00 level after the bull flattening seen in USTs in the aftermath of the Fed’s asset purchase announcement, while the enhanced liquidity auction for 2-20yr JGBs also attracted greater demand.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net nuetral on the day.

Elsewhere, <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses advanced as the constructive risk tone spurred outflows from safe-haven currencies although <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> failed to benefit and slipped below 111.00 due to the greenback’s woes, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were underpinned by their high-beta properties and rebound in commodity prices, as well as the firmer than expected reference rate setting from the PBoC.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities gained overnight with prices underpinned by the improved risk tone which lifted WTI crude prices by 3% to above the USD 24/bbl level, following suggestions by US President Trump of a sooner return to business for the US.

Elsewhere, gold prices surged above the USD 1500/oz level although prices were eventually capped overnight on the improved risk sentiment, and copper also benefitted from the more constructive tone and strength in Shanghai commodity prices alongside news that travel restrictions on the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan is to lift travel restrictions early next month.</p><p>US Department of Energy confirmed it will send special energy envoy Coates to Saudi Arabia to help stabilize oil markets, but added it is unclear when Coates will begin work there due to the coronavirus.

(Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>THE TPLEX BULL FLATTENED amid the Fed’s QE bazooka and poor risk appetite. The complex legged higher after the Fed announced its open-ended (“unlimited”) Treasury and MBS purchases, alongside a pronounced widening of the credit facilities it announced. Furthermore, the disagreement of Congress to reach an economic stimulus bill cut risk appetite, as well as casting some doubts onto the potential for an immediate ramp-up in US debt. However, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin capped the bid somewhat on mentioning of a 30-year Bond-issuing spree to ensue, although desks noted the presence of specs, CTAs and real money all buying on weakness. Meanwhile, the corporate issuance market continues to claw back, seven IG issuers coming to the dollar market on Monday, including a USD 4bln 5-parter from General Dynamics (GD), USD 5bln 5-parter from Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG), and a USD 6bln 2-parter from Wells Fargo (WFC). By settlement, the TPLEX had bull flattened, 2s30s -4bps, 2s10s -5bps, and 2s5s -5bps; 2-year -7bps, 10-year -16bps, and 30-year -20bps.

        "content": "<h2>Asia equity markets were higher across the board as the region received much-needed reprieve from the recent sell-off and reacted to the Fed’s announcement for open-ended Treasury and MBS purchases, despite Wall St failing to sustain the gains amid the ongoing stalemate at the Senate on the coronavirus relief bill. Nonetheless, US equity futures have performed better after-hours with the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA back above the 3k and 19k levels respectively following recent comments by President Trump who suggested that America will be open for business sooner than 3-4 months and as negotiators were said to be near a deal on the coronavirus stimulus bill. ASX 200 (+4.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+7.0%) rallied from the open with Australia led higher by gold miners after the precious metal surged above USD 1500/oz in the wake of the Fed’s QE bazooka, while SoftBank shares extended on the prior day’s outperformance and posted its largest intraday gain of more than 21% amid plans to offload USD 14bln of Alibaba shares. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+3.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) joined in on the broad rebound with Hong Kong outperforming the mainland as participants also digested earnings releases which was the main catalyst for the biggest moving stocks. Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and attempted to reclaim the 152.00 level after the bull flattening seen in USTs in the aftermath of the Fed’s asset purchase announcement, while the enhanced liquidity auction for 2-20yr JGBs also attracted greater demand.</h2>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board as the region gets some much-needed reprieve from the recent sell-off and reacts to the Fed’s recent announcement for open-ended Treasury and MBS purchases, although Wall St then failed to sustain the gains and finished lower amid the ongoing stalemate at the Senate on the coronavirus relief bill. Nonetheless, US equity futures have performed better after-hours with the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA back above the 3k and 19k levels respectively following recent comments by President Trump who suggested that America will be open for business sooner than 3-4 months and as negotiators are said to be near a deal on the coronavirus stimulus bill. ASX 200 (+2.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+6.7%) rallied from the open with Australia led higher by gold miners after the precious metal surged above USD 1500/oz in the wake of the Fed’s QE bazooka, while SoftBank shares extend on the prior day’s outperformance and posted its largest intraday gain of more than 21% amid plans to offload USD 14bln of Alibaba shares. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+3.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) have joined in on the broad rebound with Hong Kong outperforming the mainland as participants also digest earnings releases which has been the main driver for the biggest moving stocks.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY continues on its retracement to trade firmly below the 102.00 level in an extension of the lows seen in the aftermath of the Fed’s unlimited bond buying announcement. This has underpinned its global counterparts including EUR/USD which reclaimed the 108.00 handle and GBP/USD climbed above 1.1600 to test its 50-hour moving average of 1.1644 despite UK PM Johnson announcing a strict nationwide lockdown. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses advanced as the constructive risk tone spurs outflows from safe-haven currencies although USD/JPY fails to benefit and slipped below 111.00 due to the greenback’s woes, while antipodeans were underpinned by their high-beta properties and rebound in commodity prices, as well as the firmer than expected reference rate setting from the PBoC.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and attempted to reclaim the 152.00 level after the bull flattening seen in USTs in the aftermath of the Fed’s asset purchase announcement, while focus now turns to the enhanced liquidity auction for 2-20yr JGBs scheduled today.</p>",
