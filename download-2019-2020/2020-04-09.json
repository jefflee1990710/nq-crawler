The new adjustments in the Fed’s liquidity facilities give support to fallen angel companies, those recently downgraded to junk status, as well as supporting high yield ETFs. The latest provisions saw the financials (XLF) sector lead major bourses higher; the DX was sold heavily and XAU made solid gains. Meanwhile, energy (XLE) traded in the red as oil prices settled lower in anticipation of the G20 oil meeting on Friday; note, Thursday’s OPEC plus meeting resulted in Saudi and Russia agreeing to both cut to 8.5mln BPD output as part of a group total 10mln BPD cut for two months. Another blockbuster jobless claims report (6.6mln vs exp. 4.6mln) and the University of Michigan (preliminary for April) survey printing its steepest ever decline failed to stop the rally, as participants continue to look past near-term data.</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>US</strong> cases rise 8.7% to 427,460 (prev. +5.5% at 395,011), death toll rises 15.2% to 14,696 (prev. +6% at 12,754).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NEW YORK </strong>cases rise 7.1% to 159,937 (prev. +7.5% at 149,316), death toll rises by 12.7% to 7,067 (prev. +14.2% at 6,268)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY </strong>cases rise 2.9% to 143,625 (Prev. 139,442, +2.8%); death toll +16% 8,729 (Prev. 17,669, +3.2%).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK </strong>death toll rises 12.4% to 7,978 (prev. +15.2% at 7,097)</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>President Trump called on Congress to the pass loan programme funding this week and stated that a phase 4 stimulus bill could be done later. However, the additional loan programme was voted against by Congress on Thursday, as lawmakers had indicated. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said on CNBC that airlines (UAL, DAL, AAL, LUV, JBLU…) would be the next part of the stimulus bill to be rolled out; added that discussions would be held with the Fed for companies which don’t fit into the new facilities. Mnuchin also said that there are currently no discussions at the moment for the Fed to purchase stocks.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump said we are much closer to getting the country back to where it was before the coronavirus and he sees signs that efforts to slow the spread of the virus are working. Furthermore, Trump suggested the government could re-open the country in phases and possibly ahead of schedule. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said in the CNBC interview that is is possible that businesses could open in May. NEC Director Kudlow said on Fox Business News that the economy should be able to re-open on a “rolling basis” in the next month or two.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED MSLP: </strong>The Fed on Thursday announced further details with regards to its Main Street Lending Programme, what involves USD 2.3trln of loans to support the economy; this gains its authority from the USD 450bln allocation the Treasury received in the Cares Act that will act to indemnify the Fed against losses. Capital Economics explains that, in most of the specific facilities, the Fed will be leveraging the Treasury’s capital at a ratio of 10:1; the loan programmes will bolster the Small Business Administration’s paycheck protection programme, it will also lend to SMEs. The Fed is also setting up a USD 500bln facility to help state and Local Governments. “The upshot is that, assuming the Fed continues to buy Treasury securities, albeit at a gradually reduced pace, the Fed’s balance sheet, which has ballooned from USD 4trln to USD 6trln, will hit USD 10trln within another couple of months,” CapEco wrote.</p><p><strong>FED CHAIR POWELL: </strong>Fed Chair Powell gave remarks at the end of the week that revealed little by way of new information, although he reiterated some recent themes. He said the US was moving with alarming speed towards very high unemployment, although it would be temporary. The Fed can provide some relief and stability now, and it can use tools to ensure eventual recovery is vigorous as possible, Powell said, adding that the central bank was deploying emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, with backing from Congress and the Treasury, and would use lending powers “forcefully, aggressively, and proactively” until recovery is on a solid footing.</p><p><strong>BOE:</strong> The BoE and the Treasury have announced a temporary extension of the Ways &amp; Means facility. As a temporary measure, this will provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed to smooth its cash flows and support the orderly functioning of markets, through the period of disruption from COVID-19.</p><p><strong>ECB PRESIDENT LAGARDE </strong>said there should not be a fixation on Coronabonds (joint issuance), as things take time in Europe; said there could be other forms of European mutualised spending via a shared budget or a reconstruction fund. Furthermore, in Il Sole 24, Lagarde said budgetary and monetary policies need to be aligned, and equal conditions for all are needed, if not all countries are taken care of, then others will suffer as a result. The ECB President also noted that she believes the Euro’s value is stable and the level is “fine”, adding that she would like more inflation.</p><p><strong>ECB MINUTES:</strong> The minutes from the ECB’s 12th and 18th March meetings revealed that the central bank viewed the economic situation to be deteriorating rapidly, leading them to take unprecedented action. Financial conditions were judged to be worsening, running the risk that financial conditions would tighten in a procyclical manner. All members agreed that a further forceful monetary policy response was warranted, and there was broad support expressed for the package of measures proposed by chief economist Lane, with some nuances of views regarding specific elements of the proposal. However, there were some reservations expressed with regards to the proposed communication on the issue share and issuer limits, and these limits were one of the safeguards to ensure that the governing council acted within its mandate. There was unanimous agreement that bold and decisive action was needed to counter the serious risks posed by the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with the central bank noting that there appeared to be sufficient scope in the evolution of the purchasable universe to avoid a premature discussion on a possible lifting of these limits. A strong response was also seen to underline the credibility of the ECB’s commitment to using all of its monetary policy instruments. Analysts at ING said the minutes illustrate the ECB’s road to another ‘whatever it takes’ moment and suggest that both a rate cut and more quantitative easing should not be ruled out. “If anything, additional rate cuts should not be ruled outentirely, as some ECB members still seem to supportthem. More generally, the U-turn by Christine Lagarde to do whatever it takes clearly suggests that the ECB stands ready to do more, if need be.”</p><p><strong>BOJ:</strong> BoJ Governor Kuroda said the spread of the coronavirus is having a severe impact on Japan’s economy through exports, output, inbound tourists and a slump in consumption. Noting uncertainty on Japan’s outlook is extremely high and investor risk sentiment has soured, while markets destabilised rapidly. Kuroda added the financial system maintains soundness as a whole, but corporate funding strains are worsening. Kuroda said the BoJ would conduct commercial paper and corporate bond-buying operations to ensure corporate funding is smooth, adding the BoJ will not hesitate to take additional easing steps as required while keeping a close eye on the impact to the economy from COVID-19.</p><p><strong>RBA:</strong> The RBA financial stability review noted financial market uncertainty is elevated and that many households will find finances under strain due to efforts to contain the virus. The review highlighted the volatility caused by the pandemic but added capital levels are high and banks’ liquidity position improved over recent times, adding banks entered the downturn with high profitability and very good asset performance.</p><p><strong>BOK </strong>kept the 7-day Repo Rate unchanged at 0.75% (as expected) through a split decision as board members Cho Dong-Chul and Shin In-Seok dissented, in which they advocated a 25bps cut. BoK stated it has policy room to respond to slowing growth and will increase outright purchases of government bonds if required. At the same time, Governor Lee commented they are seeing an impact of the previous rate cut and will announce plans to buy government bonds.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>EUROGROUP: </strong>A deal was reached for an economic support package in the Eurogroup meeting, announced late on Thursday. Tony Connelly at RTE said, citing a source, “The ESM element has been agreed, the European Commission’s SURE package, mobilising up to 100bn has been agreed, + the EIB pan European guarantee scheme has been agreed. Netherlands on board.”</p><p><strong>UK LOCKDOWN / JOHNSON: </strong>PM Johnson is out of intensive care and is in “extremely good” spirits, will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery, according to an official statement. Senior Ministers are reviewing the UK’s lockdown in Thursday’s COBRA meeting, some ministers reportedly believe a decision to ease restrictions will not be taken until PM Johnson returns. Additionally, expectations are for an extension into May. Note, the current Parliamentary legislation mandates a review of the lockdown before next Thursday.</p><p><strong>EU LOCKDOWN: </strong>German Health Minister said infection numbers indicate a positive trend, and if it continues, the gov’t can talk about a gradual easing of lockdown measures; there were separate reports in Handelsblatt that Germany is mulling a loosening of restrictions after Easter. In Italy, the country could see an extension to its lockdown of another 15-days, where Italian PM Conte is reportedly to announce a new decree Friday confirming such, according to La Stampa.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Jobless claims dipped slightly in the week, to 6.61mln from a revised up 6.87mln, topping the consensus 5mln. Analysts note that over the last four readings, jobless claims have totalled 17.1mln - that compares to the 220k trend rate ahead of the COVID fallout, suggesting that the number of excess claims has risen to 16.2mln. Pantheon Macroeconomics says next week's number will also be huge, but likely lower than this week: \"Google searches for 'file for unemployment' are now falling consistently on a W/W basis, by about one third,\" and \"if that trend continues, we’d expect headline claims next week to drop to about 4.5M.\" The consultancy explains that this implies excess claims between the March and April payroll survey weeks will total some 20.1mln. \"The hit to payrolls should be a bit less than that, because the gap between the surveys this time is five weeks rather than four, but even after allowing for this, we reckon May payrolls will be reported falling by about 19mln, driving the unemployment rate to 16% if none of the newly-unemployed leave the labor force.\" Pantheon says that seems unlikely, given that the labor force reportedly dropped by 1.6mln in March, when household employment fell by 3.0mln. \"If that proportion repeats in April, headline unemployment will be about 10%, matching the peak after the Great Recession, but the true rate will be much higher, and it will rise further, along with the published rate, over the next few months.\"</p><p><strong>CANADA EMPLOYMENT:</strong> Canada jobs data was grim, with headline employment -1mln jobs M/M deeper than the expected decline of 350k in March, the first employment report to show the impacts the coronavirus is taking on the Canadian labour market. Employment rose to 7.8% from 5.6%, above expectations of 7.2%. Both full time and part-time jobs were down heavily, full time -474k, part-time -537k. The participation rate saw its largest fall to 63.5% from 65.1%. RBC notes the layoffs are heavily surrounding lower-wage service sector industries adding the worst is yet to come in April. The desk highlights the decline next month could be “multiples of this March drop” as almost 3mln people have applied for employment loss benefits since the middle of March labour force survey.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 2.33 LOWER AT USD 22.76/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 1.36 LOWER AT USD 31.48/BBL</strong></p><p>The crude complex danced to the rhythm of the evolving OPEC+ meeting, ahead of the G20 oil meeting Friday, although ultimately moved lower into settlement as participants likely closed out positions heading into the long weekend. Headlines note that the May/June contango rose to over USD 6/bbl, the widest front-month spread since 2009. At time of writing, sources have reported that Saudi and Russia have agreed to both cut oil output to 8.5mln BPD in the OPEC+ deal from May to June, which would mark a 2.79mln BPD cut from Russia and 3.8mln BPD from Saudi compared to April levels. More broadly, several sources said, including the Iranian Oil Minister, that OPEC+ is set to discuss a 10-12mln BPD cut from May to June, and then an 8mln BPD cut from July to December 2020, then a 6mln BPD cut from Jan 2021 to April 2022. The Iranian Oil Minister gave some more colour, saying Iran, Venezuela, and Libya are exempt from the cuts, with the touted cuts separate from the cuts expected of countries such as Brazil, Norway, and the US. Ahead of the Friday’s G20 meeting, which will see the likes of the US, Canada, and Norway come to the negotiating table, Canada’s Alberta Premier said the province has not been asked to cut output further and has made it clear to the US and OPEC that it has already curtailed output. Analysts have noted previously that it is most likely that the US and Canada will draw attention to the production cuts already taking place across their respective industries rather than agree to a government-enforced quota of such. The Alberta Premier went on to say that the municipal was getting very receptive responses from both Washington and Ottawa to placing tariffs on foreign oil if OPEC does not “stop the madness”. <i>Click </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/opec-headline-recap-updated-17_28pm_utc_09-04-2020\"><i>here</i></a><i> for a complete collection of OPEC meeting related headlines.</i></p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 13 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-08.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX traded choppy again as participants digested the latest Fed bazooka, gyrating OPEC+ sentiment, and minimal supply ahead of the long, Easter weekend. By settlement, yields were lower across the curve, lead by the belly, 2s -3bps at 0.23%, 5s -6bps at 0.41%, 10s -4bps at 0.72%, and 30s -1bps at 1.35%. Risk appetite had gotten off on the backfoot in European trade, as equity futures trundled lower alongside yields before the Fed announced its USD 2.3trln loan provision facilities which reversed the moves and nudged equities into a rally. The strength in Spooz going into the US session saw rates back up. However, the rally plateaued shortly after the cash equity open and saw support return for USTs - likely a function of jitters around the OPEC+ meeting and investors cutting risk exposure ahead of the long weekend. Meanwhile, corporate supply was sparse on Thursday, with no IG issuers in the dollar market, and with the Treasury’s auction reopenings out the way, there has been less selling pressure in Treasuries. Elsewhere, in credit, high-yield spreads narrowed on Thursday after the Fed’s latest announcement to support COVID-19 fallen angels (corporates that have seen their credit ratings downgraded to junk due to virus fallout), as well as high yield ETFs, with the day seeing a slew of headlines noting the spike higher in bonds of names such as Occidental (OXY) and Ford (F), amongst others. In the rates complex, three-month USD LIBOR posted a chunky 9bps decline for Thursday’s fixing, seeing the Eurodollar white pack stage a strong rally after Wednesday’s selling.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.45% at 2790, NDX +0.11% at 8239, DJIA +1.22% at 23,719.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Financials +5.19%, Real Estate +5.15%, Utilities +4.75%, Materials +4.27%, Industrials +1.43%, Cons Disc +1.43%, Cons Stpl +0.79%, Communication Svs +0.69%, Health +0.56%, Technology +0.02%, Energy -1.08%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Energy names remain in focus amid the ongoing OPEC+ deal. Note, Saudi and Russia reportedly agreed to both cut oil output to 8.5mln BPD in the OPEC+ deal. Saudi Arabia’s Sovereign wealth fund took stakes worth approximately USD 1bln in four major European oil companies, Equinor (EQNR NO), Shell (RDS.A LN), Total (FP FP) and Eni (ENI IM), according to sources, a Saudi official added they would not be surprised if we see similar deals again. Airlines (LUV, DAL, AAL, UAL) aid worth USD 29bln for the sector is reportedly being delayed as companies have been required to provide more detailed financial data to regulators in an already lengthy process. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin states airline aid is the next to be rolled out. Goldminers (NEM, GOLD) firmer amid higher gold prices following the Fed’s latest additional USD 2.3trln loan facility to support the economy. Pfizer Inc. (PFE) has reportedly found a promising but early treatment for the coronavirus, which it aims to begin testing in patients this summer, it found the experimental drug could slow or stop the spread of the virus in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Microchip Technology (MCHP) announced it is cutting costs while expecting quarterly revenue to increase by 3% (exp. -3.3%, prev. forecast 0%). MCHP noted the strength in bookings could be due to worries about supply chain disruptions, but it expects product demand is likely to weaken significantly. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) net sales in March at USD 15.49bln, +11.7% Y/Y. Total comparable sales +9.6%, ex-fuel +12.3%. Starbucks (SBUX) expects a Q2 20 EPS at USD 0.32/shr, - USD 0.15-0.18 from prior guidance and expects Q3 impact to be significantly greater and to extend into Q4. General Electric (GE) withdrew its financial guidance due to the coronavirus, noting its preliminary view expects an impact on Adj. EPS to be USD 0.10 beneath prior guidance. Also expects Q1 industrial free cash flow to be near prior guidance of USD -2bln. Align Technology (ALGN) named a new short at Spruce Point Capital.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>FED BANGS THE BUCK, BUT BOOSTS BROAD RISK SENTIMENT</strong></p><p><strong>DXY:</strong> It’s debatable whether or not the Dollar was heading for a fall anyway given another record rise in the number of US initial claims, but the Fed removed doubt by unveiling its latest in an increasingly long line of credit easing packages at precisely the same time. In short, no less than Usd2.3 tn will be made available via an array of funding facilities including a Usd600 bn Main Street Lending Program targeting SMEs. The index tried to retain sight of the 100.000 mark, but could not withstand the weight of all round Greenback selling against major rivals and EM currencies as the aggressive stimulus gave flagging risk appetite a fillip. Indeed, the DXY declined to fresh wtd lows just a fraction above 99.400 compared to almost 101.000 at best and remained under pressure through downbeat/dovish commentary from Fed chair Powell pledging even more support for the economy without limit in terms of size, time or scope. From a chart perspective, April 2’s 99.335 now looms large.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD:</strong> The Aussie and Kiwi have gleaned more than fellow G10s from their US peer’s demise, as Aud/Usd probes above 0.6300 and Nzd/Usd tags along to top 0.6060, but the Loonie is also benefiting from a more pronounced rebound in crude prices amidst reports that OPEC+ and other global oil producers are planning to discuss an output cut of 20 mn bpd, even more than the 10-15 mn initially alluded to by US President Trump. In fact, Usd/Cad has posted a new weekly base at 1.3930 vs 1.4260 or so at the apex even though Canadian employment slumped by more than 1 mn in March ahead of next week’s BoC policy meeting.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPYP:</strong> Sterling has spent the bulk of the week monitoring the health of UK PM Johnson, but did stumble after a raft of data and especially yawning trade deficits against consensus and previous balances. However, the Pound eventually mustered enough momentum to breach several technical hurdles that had been hampering upside progress alongside updates from the hospital indicating that he is responding well to medication and in a more stable condition. Cable eclipsed 1.2475 and Eur/Gbp crossed through 200 DMA and Fib levels on the way to circa 0.8727 before the single currency reclaimed 1.0900+ status vs the Buck with some independent impetus via remarks from Germany’s Finance Minister Scholz suggesting that the Eurogroup is likely to find a resolution on a fiscal package to counter the COVID-19 economic fallout. Elsewhere, the renowned safe havens have not been sticking strictly to their roles, as overall swings in sentiment have intermingled with daily updates and vigils on nCoV cases and fatality rates. Meanwhile, the Franc and Yen have also been conscious of Swiss and Japanese efforts to cushion the blow from the global pandemic and both relatively contained within 0.9797-0.9651 and 109.37-108.36 parameters respectively, though ending the EU week close to peaks given the aforementioned Dollar weakness.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM:</strong> Notwithstanding several hiccups and negative factors like disappointing data and general bouts of risk aversion, the Norwegian and Swedish Crowns remain on course to net hefty gains against the Euro (and Greenback), with the Nok bolstered by a full week of bigger Norges Bank purchases and Sek drawing encouragement from evidence that containment is having a positive effect on flattening the coronavirus curve elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Rouble and Mexican Peso have been supported by more stable Brent and WTI pending the outcome of OPEC+ and others, while the Real has clawed back from all time lows on BCB vibes after the Governor pledged to embark on more aggressive intervention. Similarly, the Rand and Lira have both pared heavy losses on better fundamental news in the form of Eskom contending that it has sufficient funds for the rest of the year and will not need to ask the SA Government to provide more financial assistance, while Turkey is said to have held constructive talks with the IMF.</p>",

By settlement, yields were lower across the curve, lead by the belly, 2s -3bps at 0.23%, 5s -6bps at 0.41%, 10s -4bps at 0.72%, and 30s -1bps at 1.35%. Risk appetite had gotten off on the backfoot in European trade, as equity futures trundled lower alongside yields before the Fed announced its USD 2.3trln loan provision facilities which reversed the moves and nudged equities into a rally. The strength in Spooz going into the US session saw rates back up. However, the rally plateaued shortly after the cash equity open and saw support return for USTs - likely a function of jitters around the OPEC+ meeting and investors cutting risk exposure ahead of the long weekend. Meanwhile, corporate supply was sparse on Thursday, with no IG issuers in the dollar market, and with the Treasury’s auction reopenings out the way, there has been less selling pressure in Treasuries. Elsewhere, in credit, high-yield spreads narrowed on Thursday after the Fed’s latest announcement to support COVID-19 fallen angels (corporates that have seen their credit ratings downgraded to junk due to virus fallout), as well as high yield ETFs, with the day seeing a slew of headlines noting the spike higher in bonds of names such as Occidental (OXY) and Ford (F), amongst others. In the rates complex, three-month USD LIBOR posted a chunky 9bps decline for Thursday’s fixing, seeing the Eurodollar white pack stage a strong rally after Wednesday’s selling.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>The crude complex danced to the rhythm of the evolving OPEC+ meeting, ahead of the G20 oil meeting Friday, although ultimately moved lower into settlement as participants likely closed out positions heading into the long weekend. Headlines note that the May/June contango rose to over USD 6/bbl, the widest front-month spread since 2009. At time of writing, sources have reported that Saudi and Russia have agreed to both cut oil output to 8.5mln BPD in the OPEC+ deal from May to June, which would mark a 2.79mln BPD cut from Russia and 3.8mln BPD from Saudi compared to April levels. More broadly, several sources said, including the Iranian Oil Minister, that OPEC+ is set to discuss a 10-12mln BPD cut from May to June, and then an 8mln BPD cut from July to December 2020, then a 6mln BPD cut from Jan 2021 to April 2022. The Iranian Oil Minister gave some more colour, saying Iran, Venezuela and Libya are exempt from the cuts, with the touted cuts separate from the cuts expected of countries such as Brazil, Norway and the US. Ahead of the Friday’s G20 meeting, which will see the likes of the US, Canada and Norway come to the negotiating table, Canada’s Alberta Premier said the province has not been asked to cut output further and has made it clear to the US and OPEC that it has already curtailed output. Analysts have noted previously that it is most likely that the US and Canada will draw attention to the production cuts already taking place across their respective industries rather than agree to a government-enforced quota of such. The Alberta Premier went on to say that the municipal was getting very receptive responses from both Washington and Ottawa to placing tariffs on foreign oil if OPEC does not “stop the madness”. <i>Click </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/opec-headline-recap-updated-17_28pm_utc_09-04-2020\"><i>here</i></a><i> for a complete collection of OPEC meeting related headlines.</i></li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>It’s debatable whether or not the Dollar was heading for a fall anyway given another record rise in the number of US initial claims, but the Fed removed doubt by unveiling its latest in an increasingly long line of credit easing packages at precisely the same time. In short, no less than Usd2.3 tn will be made available via an array of funding facilities including a Usd600 bn Main Street Lending Program targeting SMEs. The index tried to retain sight of the 100.000 mark, but could not withstand the weight of all round Greenback selling against major rivals and EM currencies as the aggressive stimulus gave flagging risk appetite a fillip. Indeed, the DXY declined to fresh wtd lows just a fraction above 99.400 compared to almost 101.000 at best and remained under pressure through downbeat/dovish commentary from Fed chair Powell pledging even more support for the economy without limit in terms of size, time or scope. From a chart perspective, April 2’s 99.335 now looms large.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi have gleaned more than fellow G10s from their US peer’s demise, as Aud/Usd probes above 0.6300 and Nzd/Usd tags along to top 0.6060, but the Loonie is also benefiting from a more pronounced rebound in crude prices amidst reports that OPEC+ and other global oil producers are planning to discuss an output cut of 20 mn bpd, even more than the 10-15 mn initially alluded to by US President Trump. In fact, Usd/Cad has posted a new weekly base at 1.3930 vs 1.4260 or so at the apex even though Canadian employment slumped by more than 1 mn in March ahead of next week’s BoC policy meeting.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Sterling has spent the bulk of the week monitoring the health of UK PM Johnson, but did stumble after a raft of data and especially yawning trade deficits against consensus and previous balances. However, the Pound eventually mustered enough momentum to breach several technical hurdles that had been hampering upside progress alongside updates from the hospital indicating that he is responding well to medication and in a more stable condition. Cable eclipsed 1.2475 and Eur/Gbp crossed through 200 DMA and Fib levels on the way to circa 0.8727 before the single currency reclaimed 1.0900+ status vs the Buck with some independent impetus via remarks from Germany’s Finance Minister Scholz suggesting that the Eurogroup is likely to find a resolution on a fiscal package to counter the COVID-19 economic fallout. Elsewhere, the renowned safe havens have not been sticking strictly to their roles, as overall swings in sentiment have intermingled with daily updates and vigils on nCoV cases and fatality rates. Meanwhile, the Franc and Yen have also been conscious of Swiss and Japanese efforts to cushion the blow from the global pandemic and both relatively contained within 0.9797-0.9651 and 109.37-108.36 parameters respectively, though ending the EU week close to peaks given the aforementioned Dollar weakness.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding several hiccups and negative factors like disappointing data and general bouts of risk aversion, the Norwegian and Swedish Crowns remain on course to net hefty gains against the Euro (and Greenback), with the Nok bolstered by a full week of bigger Norges Bank purchases and Sek drawing encouragement from evidence that containment is having a positive effect on flattening the coronavirus curve elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Rouble and Mexican Peso have been supported by more stable Brent and WTI pending the outcome of OPEC+ and others, while the Real has clawed back from all time lows on BCB vibes after the Governor pledged to embark on more aggressive intervention. Similarly, the Rand and Lira have both pared heavy losses on better fundamental news in the form of Eskom contending that it has sufficient funds for the rest of the year and will not need to ask the SA Government to provide more financial assistance, while Turkey is said to have held constructive talks with the IMF.</p>",

        "subject": "US EQUITY OPEN: US equities open firmer aided by Fed's latest efforts while participants eye OPEC++, Fed's Powell and Eurogroup press conference",
        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO:</strong> APAC trade continued the risk-on tone set by Wall Street. However, equity bourses began receding heading into the European open, with US futures trading in the red, although the Fed’s latest USD 2.3trln loan provision announcement has put bourses back into the green – note, one should consider an element of book squaring at play ahead of the long, Easter weekend. The risk aversion is seeing the TPLEX mixed with yields slightly lower across the curve, apart from the long end. DXY performance is lackluster beneath the 100-figure, while gold is bid around its weekly high, last at 1675. Meanwhile, the crude complex continues to dance to the rhythm of the OPEC++ meeting developments, currently firmer.</p><p><strong>MARKET FOCUS: </strong>The OPEC++ meeting remains the centrepiece on Thursday (scheduled to start at 15:00 BST/10:00 ET), where participants are expecting the group to produce a landmark oil production cut to counter the oil price rout that has been causing reverberations for households, corporations, and governments globally. The latest source reports suggest Saudi can cut oil production from its newly hit levels of 12.3mln BPD and is ready to cut by 4mln BPD. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Powell is also due to make remarks at 10:00 ET. On the backburner, the Eurogroup meeting is scheduled to resume at 17:00 CET after the EZ finance minister failed to reach an agreement for EU-wide stimulus on Tuesday. The latest initial jobless claims saw a rise to 6.6mln from 6.5mln last week, above market consensus for a 5.25mln print, although within analyst ranges, where some called for over 9mln.</p><p><strong>SECTOR THEMES:</strong> Energy names (XOM, CVX, COP, OXY), ahead of the OPEC+ call open firmer with the sector leading gains. Saudi Arabia’s Sovereign wealth fund took stakes worth approximately USD 1bln in four major European oil companies, Equinor (EQNR NO), Shell (RDS.A LN), Total (FP FP) and Eni (ENI IM) &nbsp;according to reports citing people familiar with the matter, a Saudi official added they would not be surprised if we see similar deals again.&nbsp; Airlines (LUV, DAL, AAL, UAL) aid worth USD 29bln for the sector is reportedly being delayed as companies have been required to provide more detailed financial data to regulators in an already lengthy process. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin states airline aid is the next to be rolled out. Goldminers (NEM, GOLD) firmer amid higher gold prices following the Fed’s latest additional USD 2.3trln loan facility to support the economy.</p><p><strong>US EQUITY STORIES:</strong> Pfizer Inc. (PFE) has reportedly found a promising but early treatment for the coronavirus, which it aims to begin testing in patients this summer, it found the experimental drug could slow or stop the spread of the virus in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Microchip Technology (MCHP) announced it is cutting costs while expecting quarterly revenue to increase 3% (exp. -3.3%, prev. forecast 0%). MCHP noted the strength in bookings could be due to worries about supply chain disruptions, but it expects product demand is likely to weaken significantly. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) net sales in March at USD 15.49bln, +11.7% Y/Y. Total comparable sales +9.6%, ex fuel +12.3%. Starbucks (SBUX) expect a Q2 20 EPS at USD 0.32/shr – USD 0.15-0.18 from prior guidance and expects Q3 impact to be significantly greater and to extend into Q4. General Electric (GE) withdrew its financial guidance due to the coronavirus, noting its preliminary view expects an impact on Adj. EPS to be USD 0.10 beneath prior guidance. Also expects Q1 industrial free cash flow to be near prior guidance of USD -2bln.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SUPPLY &amp; DEMAND: </strong>Nomura continues to class equity strength as bear market rally, mainly based on the result of central banks’ efforts to stanch the bleeding through bold easing measures. “The current rally is characterized by two features related to systematic supply and demand,” the bank notes, “The first feature is that bottoming in sentiment tends to trigger short-term factor reversals. We currently appear to be entering a phase in which investors buy back value (P/B) and dividend yield factors and sell quality (ROE) and low-vol factors. The second is that risk-parity funds have stopped net selling high-yield bonds. The weighting of high-yield bonds in risk-parity funds’ portfolios is nearing its lowest point since 2013 (around 20%), and risk-parity funds now appear to have stopped selling off high-yield bonds as part of their systematic rebalancing.” Nomura notes that in the near term, bearish positions look likely to continue to be closed out, and any further rallies would call for a “reality check”.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Last week’s jobless claims saw a record of 6.65mln jobs, with expectations for this weeks print likely to be somewhere similar with analysts expecting a print of 5.25mln, although the ranges vary from as low as 2.5mln to 9.295mln on the top end. Continued jobless claims expected at 8mln; ranges from 2.054mln to 13.2mln. Bank of America is expecting to see another 6.5mln print. The bank tracked headlines in 16 states which it estimates to be around 2.5mln, thus assuming a similar trend it would take the total to 6.5mln. BofA however believes that risks are tiled to the upside after seeing an increase in data from Google Trends shows an increase in searches for unemployment benefits and filing for unemployment, while it notes there were signs governments are adjusting to better process the filings, adding “some states believed the worst was yet to come”. The desk also highlights the passing of the CARES act and Coronavirus Aid Relief increases eligibility for jobless claims for other workers and boost the maximum number of weeks that one can receive benefits. The desk adds this creates an incentive for businesses to temporarily furlough employees as they will be financially covered. However, seasonal factors could have an impact, “combining last week’s non-seasonally adjusted figure of 5.8mln with this week’s lower seasonal factor would result in seasonally adjusted claims of 6.2mln instead of 6.6mln that was actually reported.” &nbsp;</p>",

Indeed, the core Eurozone bond staged another seemingly futile and fleeting bounce to 170.49 (+3 ticks on the day) and hit offers ahead of the EU cash bourse opens that pulled prices back down towards the 170.01 overnight Eurex low. Eurogroup meeting aside, Thursday’s pre-Easter agenda also includes more Eurozone data and ECB minutes, though today’s other highlights are likely to be the outcome of OPEC+, US weekly claims and perhaps preliminary Michigan sentiment as one of the first releases for the current month.</p>",

Participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the FFR at 0.00-0.25% percent until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.</p><p><strong>Furthermore, several participants suggested that the public might view the ability of the Committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being limited after lowering rates to the Effective Lower Bound (ELB).</strong> However, this was countered by some by saying new forward guidance or balance sheet measures could be introduced. The minutes added that there was an \"extremely large degree\" of uncertainty on the outlook and many participants had repeatedly downgraded their outlook of late in response to the rapidly evolving situation.

(Newswires/AFP/Handelsblatt)</p><p><strong>UK PM Johnson remains in intensive care and continued to make steady progress, according to a statement.</strong> In other news, the UK Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser said the count of new cases is not accelerating out of control and the spread of the virus is not accelerating which is good news. (Newswires)</p><p>Senior UK Ministers are to review the UK’s lockdown in today’s COBRA meeting, some ministers reportedly believe a decision to ease restrictions will not be taken until PM Johnson returns. Additionally, expectations are for an extension into May.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets were mostly higher as the region marginally benefitted from the tailwinds from Wall St</strong> where major indices were underpinned by hopes of a coronavirus peak nearing and amid a surge in energy prices on optimism for a potential output cut deal at today’s OPEC+ meeting. <strong>ASX 200 (+2.6%)</strong> was buoyed after parliament approved the record AUD 130bln stimulus bill to support jobs and with upside led by notable strength in financials and tech, while energy names were lifted by the surge in oil prices after reports suggested potential cuts of 10mln-15mln bpd were being touted and that Russia was ready to join in on an OPEC+ deal. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.6%)</strong> lagged amid a choppy currency and after source reports noted the BoJ is to project an economic contraction but added there was no consensus yet within the central bank whether this would warrant additional easing. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.9%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> also traded positive but with gains capped as the former heads into the extended Easter weekend, while upside in the mainland was also limited after the PBoC refrained from liquidity injections and the Politburo reiterated the view that China was facing increasing difficulties for economic development. Finally, 10yr JGBs nursed the prior day’s losses and reclaimed the 152.00 level amid the underperformance in Japanese stocks and following stronger demand at the 5yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.0536 vs. Exp. 7.0488 (Prev. 7.0483)</strong></p><p><strong>BoK kept the 7-day Repo Rate unchanged at 0.75% as expected through a split decision as board members Cho Dong-Chul and Shin In-Seok dissented in which they advocated a 25bps cut.</strong> BoK stated it has policy room to respond to slowing growth and will increase outright purchases of government bonds if required, while Governor Lee commented they are seeing an impact of the previous rate cut and will announce plans to buy government bonds this afternoon. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK Chancellor Sunak said he is confident the UK will get through this but cannot say there is not going to be hardship ahead and there is no precise estimate how much economic support will cost. Sunak added there will be a COBRA meeting for today and that virus outbreak will have a significant impact on the economy when asked if unemployment will rise sharply. (Newswires)</p><p>UK RICS Housing Survey (Mar) 11 vs. Exp. 14.0 (Prev. 29.0). Furthermore, UK RICS near-term house sales expectations printed at -92 in March which was the lowest reading since the series began in 1998.

Lagarde added that it is essential to prevent viable firms from folding and employees from losing jobs. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> was steady above the 100.00 level with price action rangebound following an uneventful FOMC Minutes release in which members viewed the near-term US economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply and was profoundly uncertain, while they noted it would be appropriate to maintain the current level of rates until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability targets. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was flat above 1.0850 after the Eurogroup failed to reach an agreement on coronavirus support in which talks were dragged out to Thursday and with the single currency sandwiched between a slew of hourly MA levels including its 50-Hour and 100-Hour moving averages, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was capped by resistance at 1.2400 although remained near the prior day’s best levels with PM Johnson’s condition said to be improving. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> stalled at the 109.00 level and antipodeans held on to the recent risk-fuelled gains with only a mild pullback seen in <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> following the RBA Financial Stability Review which noted financial market uncertainty is elevated and that many households will find finances under strain due to efforts to contain the virus.</p><p>RBA Financial Stability Review said regulatory authorities have been working together to minimise economic harm from pandemic but noted financial market uncertainty is elevated and that the heightened uncertainty related to pandemic is compounding usual volatility in financial markets. RBA added that capital levels are high and banks' liquidity positions improved over recent times, while banks also entered the downturn with high profitability and very good asset performance. Furthermore, it stated that many households in the period ahead will find finances under strain due to efforts to contain the virus. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities edged mild gains overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures briefly broke above the USD 26.00/bbl level as it extended on the rally seen heading into today’s OPEC+ meeting amid optimism for an agreement after the Algeria Energy Minister suggested the meeting will be fruitful and his Kuwaiti touting a potential 10mln-15mln bpd cut, while Russia was also said to be on board for a deal that would end the current oil price war. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> traded steady with price action stuck within a tight range near the USD 1650/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> prices were higher but with upside only limited amid the similar cautious gains seen across Asia-Pac bourses.</p><p><strong>The Algerian oil minister said the emergency OPEC+ meeting will be \"fruitful\" and later added that the emergency OPEC++ meeting will discuss a massive reduction in production which could reach 10mln bpd.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Kuwait Oil Minister said that after talking with countries that will attend OPEC+ meeting, the intention is moving towards reaching an agreement to lower output by a large amount between 10mln-15mln bpd.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Russia is reportedly ready to cut production by 1.6mln BPD, according to Tass citing comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak</strong>, while other reports also noted Russia is ready to participate in the OPEC+ deal in line with its share in oil production of countries involved in the deal. (TASS/Newswires) Goldman Sachs suggested that a 10mln bpd cut would not be enough to improve the global balance and it sees downside risks to near-term WTI price forecast of USD 20/bbl, but added that lasting supply could create upside risks for its USD 40/bbl October estimate for Brent. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs now expects Q2 demand to be down 14mln bpd Y/Y, while it sees demand in Q3 and Q4 falling 3.3mln and 1.4mln bpd Y/Y. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi-led coalition announced there will be a 2-week ceasefire in Yemen beginning Thursday following UN calls for a pause in hostilities amid the coronavirus pandemic</strong>. There were also comments from the Saudi Vice Defence Minister that the kingdom fully supports UN calls for de-escalation and confidence building measures, as well as resumption of political talks between political parties in Yemen. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasuries endured a choppy session, although ranges have been thinner and major curve spreads are ultimately steeper, led by a strong bid at the 2-year tenor, while yields along the long-end are higher on the day. The T-Note had originally seen support in early European trade as the Eurogroup meeting failure induced risk-off. However, participants soon looked past the news amid a bid in equity futures, and yields moved higher. Duration also came under pressure after Treasury Sec. Mnuchin doubled-down on its plans for issuance out the curve, citing the (yet-to-be-released) 20-year bond, again. Corporate supply was also weighted towards the long-end across six IG issuers (although less than Monday and Tuesday), in addition to Abu Dhabi launched USD 7bln of 5s, 10s, and 30s. As the NY Fed’s daily operations got underway, the whole curve found support, and steepened, rising in sync with equities, and richening ahead of the Treasury’s upsized 30-year auction reopening, where USD 17bln was sold at a high rate of 1.325%, stopping through by 0.5bps, and was covered 2.35x; Dealers and indirects took a bit more than average at the expense of less direct participation (11% vs six-auction avg. 17.7%). By settlement, yields were mixed; worth noting in the rates complex, the white strip of Eurodollar curve was little changed, indicative of participants expectations of LIBOR to remain elevated for the near future. However, UBS’ strategists expressed their view recently that they see the rate normalising in the next month or so. US T-note futures (M0) settled 2 ticks lower at 137-27.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fed's Kaplan (voter, dove)</strong> said US GDP may shrink 25%-35% in Q2 then expand in H2 and sees GDP shrinking 4%-5% in 2020, while unemployment rate may rise as high as mid-teens before declining to 7%-8% by year-end. Kaplan added that even after economy reopens, consumers may be more cautious and that he expects a phased return to work as economy reopens. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (non-voter, hawk)</strong> said it is hard to imagine the US heading back to work until infection numbers drop which could be in May or even later.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly higher as the region marginally benefitted from the tailwinds from Wall St where the major indices were underpinned by hopes of a coronavirus peak nearing and amid a surge in energy prices on optimism for a potential output cut deal at today’s OPEC+ meeting. ASX 200 (+2.6%) was buoyed after parliament approved the record AUD 130bln stimulus bill to support jobs and with upside led by notable strength in financials and tech, while energy names were lifted by the surge in oil prices after reports suggested potential cuts of 10mln-15mln bpd were being touted and that Russia was ready to join in on an OPEC+ deal. Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) lagged amid a choppy currency and after source reports noted the BoJ is to project an economic contraction but added there was no consensus yet within the central bank whether this would warrant additional easing. Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) also traded positive but with gains capped as the former heads into the extended Easter weekend, while upside in the mainland was also limited after the PBoC refrained from liquidity injections and the Politburo reiterated the view that China was facing increasing difficulties for economic development. Finally, 10yr JGBs nursed the prior day’s losses and reclaimed the 152.00 level amid the underperformance in Japanese stocks and following stronger demand at the 5yr JGB auction.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region marginally benefits from the tailwinds from Wall St where the major indices were underpinned by hopes of a coronavirus peak nearing and amid a surge in energy prices on optimism for a potential output cut deal at today’s OPEC+ meeting. ASX 200 (+1.9%) is buoyed after parliament approved the record AUD 130bln stimulus bill to support jobs and with upside led by notable strength in financials and tech, while energy names are lifted by the surge in oil prices after reports suggested potential cuts of 10mln-15mln bpd were being touted and that Russia was ready to join in on an OPEC+ deal. Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) lags amid a choppy currency and after source reports noted the BoJ is to project an economic contraction but added there was no consensus yet within the central bank whether this would warrant additional easing. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) are also positive but with gains capped as the former heads into the extended Easter weekend, while upside in the mainland is also limited after the PBoC refrained from liquidity injections and the Politburo reiterated the view that China was facing increasing difficulties for economic development.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady above the 100.00 level with price action rangebound following an uneventful FOMC Minutes release in which members viewed the near-term US economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply and was profoundly uncertain, while they noted it would be appropriate to maintain the current level of rates until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability targets. Price action across the pond has also left much to be desired with EUR/USD flat around 1.0850 after the Eurogroup failed to reach an agreement on coronavirus support with talks dragged out to Thursday and with the single currency sandwiched between a slew of hourly MA levels including its 50-Hour and 100-Hour moving averages, while GBP/USD is capped by resistance at 1.2400 although remains near the prior day’s best levels with PM Johnson’s condition said to be improving. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is indecisive after having stalled at the 109.00 level and antipodeans hold on to the recent risk- and energy-fuelled gains with only a mild pullback seen in AUD/USD following the RBA Financial Stability Review which noted financial market uncertainty is elevated and that many households will find finances under strain due to efforts to contain the virus.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs nurse the prior day’s losses and reclaimed the 152.00 level amid the underperformance in Japanese stocks and with focus shifting to the looming 5yr JGB auction.</p>",
