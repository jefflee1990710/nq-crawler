        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites down, Treasuries up, Dollar down, Crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> USD down having printed YTD highs, UK PM May to outline departure tomorrow, weak US PMI data, weak GE PMI Data, US President Trump unveils 16bln aid for farmers, ECB Minutes confirm voter doubts over Eurozone H2 recovery, worst day for crude complex in 2019</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>JN Core CPI, UK Retail Sales, US Durable Goods, Baker Hughes, ECB’s Nowotny, Earnings from; Foot Locker, Liberty Global, AP Moeller Maersk</p><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP: </strong>Risk-off trade saw the DXY print fresh YTD highs, pushing EUR to YTD lows (partly inspired by weak PMI data) before both moves reversed in later trade; havens JPY, CHF, XAU were also bid as equities slid. In Treasuries, the 3m/10y curve inverted again as the curve bull-flattened. Equities went south, with the Dow opening 400 points lower. SPX also opened 18 points lower, led lower by the energy sector which followed crude down; the crude complex was hit given the demand nature of concerns (global growth, trade wars, etc), resulting in prompt WTI trading sub-60, and front Brent sub-70.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE:</strong> An article in the People's Daily overnight accused the US of behaving like a \"bull in a china shop\" by bypassing the WTO and imposing unilateral tariffs, in a continuing sign that although both sides have said that the 'door is open' for more talks, relations are breaking down ahead of the G20 in June, where US and Chinese teams are set to meet. If we are seeking any clues about the Chinese stance, MOFCOM's Gao said China will not make concessions on key major issues in trade talks. Desks are also now becoming weary about a possible Chinese retaliation against US companies. On the Huawei front, the Chinese technology co. continues to take hits with major Japanese mobile carriers the latest to postpone sales of the company's new smartphones, after the US took measures largely aimed at Huawei this week. Elsewhere, the US President Trump announced a USD 16bln aid package for US farmers hit by Chinese sanctions, which he said would be paid for by China (via the tariffs on Chinese imports). He also said that he is hopeful that US will get together with China at some point, and looks forward to seeing China President Xi at the G20 before also adding that \"it will be great to meet up with China, but if it doesn't, then fine\".</p><p><strong>* US PMI: </strong>US Markit composite PMI (May flash) 50.9 (Prev. 53.0), manufacturing 50.6 (Exp. 52.5, Prev. 52.6), Services 50.9 (Exp. 53.2, Prev. 53). Growth of business activity slowed sharply in May as trade war worries and increased uncertainty dealt a further blow to order book growth and business confidence, Markit said. A decline to three-year lows is historically consistent with GDP growth at an annualised rate of just 1.2% in May. \"Worse may be to come, as inflows of new business showed the smallest rise seen this side of the global financial crisis,\" Markit said, \"business confidence has meanwhile slumped to its lowest since at least 2012, causing firms to tighten their belts, notably in respect to hiring. Jobs growth in May was the weakest seen for over two years.\" The slowdown was led by manufacturing, but there are increasing signs of spreading to services. \"The survey data have been consistent with falling manufacturing output since February, but suggest that the sector’s woes intensified in May to mean factories will therefore likely act as an increasing drag on the economy in the second quarter,\" Markit said, \"trade wars remained top of the list of concerns among manufacturers, alongside signs of slower sales and weaker economic growth both at home and in key export markets.\"</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES: </strong>The annualised rate fell to 673k in April against expectations of 675k, and the previous was revised +31k higher to 723k. Despite the miss, analysts said the upward trend since Q4 remains intact.</p><p><strong>* EZ PMI:</strong> Headline +0.1 points to 51.6 in May (cons. 51.7). Both manufacturing and services fell. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the reason why we are seeing declines in the sub-components and an increase in the headline is that the composite index only includes the manufacturing output indicator, not the headline. Either way, the details are generally depressing reading, PM said, growth in new orders and output remains overall subdued, which has dragged employment growth down to a three-year low. And \"adding insult to injury, firms' outlook for the future weakened to a four-and-a-half year low, and selling prices are contained by competition.\" PM says the upshot is that the hard data have so far been much better than this overall sombre message, but it suspects that the Q2 numbers will come in more closely with the surveys.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY PMI:</strong> Rose slightly (52.4, cons. 52.0, prev. 52.2); data seemed odd given the services and manufacturing both fell; explanation is that the composite headline is a output indicator in itself. Nevertheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics said conditions in the German private sector are still split between a relatively resilient services sector and a manufacturing industry reeling under weakness in both domestic and external demand.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK PM May is to give a firm departure date, outlining her departure schedule to 1922 Committee Chief Brady at their meeting on Friday. This followed the governments decision to pull plans to publish the WAB, with UK PM May \"listening to colleagues\" concerns about the it, according to PM May spokesman. Earlier in the week, the 1922 Committee reportedly held a secret ballot to change leadership rules, allowing them to challenge May's leadership, and the Guido Fawkes blog on Wednesday reporting that the Committee has the numbers needed to make the changes - analysts had speculated that this could be used as leverage to force the PM's hand. Betting markets indicate that the top three contenders to replace May are all Brexiteers. ITV’s Peston later speculated that, when UK PM May does outline the timeline for her departure this Friday, the leadership race to find her replacement could begin as early as 10 June.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES REVIEW:</strong> The account of the April meeting primarily revealed that policymakers noted “inflation remained uncomfortably below the Governing Council’s inflation aim” and “the projected inflation convergence had been repeatedly delayed”. The dovish take on inflation was also met with a relatively downbeat assessment of the Eurozone economy with central bankers holding less confidence in their belief of a H2 2019 recovery; thus confirming source reports that followed the April meeting which also revealed that some at the Bank question the accuracy of the ECB’s forecasting model. The pessimism surrounding the Eurozone economy wasn’t necessarily new information for market participants, however, given recent sluggish data since the meeting, the accounted highlighted the pressures facing the Bank in their bid to normalise policy. On that note, the account also revealed that TLTRO terms are to be decided at an upcoming meeting, some argued for TLTRO to function as a backstop, whilst some wanted to use it to adjust policy stance. A recent call from Credit Ag (before today’s minutes were published) suggested the Bank will “start TLTRO III at the refi-rate-minus-20bp, but that it could change it over time, in particular if there are renewed weaknesses in the banking system, sovereign tensions or a weakness in credit-lending”. Other measures that were discussed at the April meeting included the prospect of tiered rates, whereby policymakers acknowledged they may need to consider whether or not the side effects of NIRP requires mitigation. As a reference, a recent piece by UBS outlined three requirements the ECB should hold for any tiering system; 1) tiering rules should be simple, transparent and non-discriminatory, 2) EONIA rates should not rise, i.e. monetary tightening should be avoided and 3) the resulting cost savings for Eurozone banks should be meaningful. Overall, following today’s release, ING concludes that the “pricing of the first TLTRO could be quite generous”, whilst “as for the tiering of the deposit rate, it remains a long shot, but something that would certainly be considered if the Governing Council were to contemplate a further rate cut”.</p><p><strong>* SARB REVIEW:</strong> The South African Reserve Bank left its repo rate unchanged at 6.75% as expected, albeit with a narrow vote split as two out of the five policymakers sought a cut. The Central Bank moderated its medium-term inflation outlooks, now seen averaging at 4.5% this year (Prev. 4.8%), 4.8% in 2020 (Prev. 4.9%), whilst stating that risks to inflation are considered more or less balanced. Furthermore, SARB cut its 2019 GDP to 1.0% (Prev. 1.3%) and maintained its 2020 and 2021 forecasts at 1.8% and 2.0% respectively, with the CB highlighting that near-term growth outlook has been limited by a larger than expected slowdown in Q1. Alongside the dovish economic forecasts, the SARB’s model now point towards a 25bps cut to its repo rate by the end of 2021, a step back from March’s forecast of one rate hike by the end of this year. Thus, ZAR weakened in response, with USD/ZAR clipping 15.5200 to the upside from a pre-decision level of around 14.5050.</p><p><strong>* FEDSPEAK:</strong> Nothing particularly new from Fedspeak today, which was all from non-voters, with the message largely reiterating the FOMC’s neutral, patient stance. Mester said it would be bad policy to cut rates, Kaplan reiterated the need for patience and a neutral outlook, Fed’s Daly noted uncertainty among businesses due to the trade environment, while Fed’s Barkin said businesses he has spoken to were holding investments back. Fed’s Bostic, who has been heavily featuring on the recent speakers slate, said the FOMC could use whatever tools required to combat future recessions.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) SETTLES USD 3.51 LOWER AT USD 57.91/BBL; BRENT (N9) SETTLES USD 3.23 LOWER AT USD 67.76/BBL. </strong>The crude markets are flirting with their biggest loss of the year on Thursday, with the market breaking out below key technical levels and out of its recent range, where a string of disappointing global data prints, on top of the rising US inventories, has given credence to the bears. The Eurozone printed disappointing PMIs, with the focus on its power-hub Germany’s manufacturing coming in below already gloomy expectations, the US later followed suit with its manufacturing and services Flash PMIs both significantly missing estimates, catalysing further downside in crude. Where the market had previously been running on the fears of conflict in the Persian Gulf and talk of sustained OPEC+ supply cuts, it appears these supply factors are playing second fiddle to the ominous global demand signals. Elsewhere in supply newsflow, further efforts are being made to resolve the Druzhba pipeline charade, Russia's Transneft said they had agreed with Belarus on a technical plan for resolving the issue, adding that there will be clean oil in Poland on June 9th/10th. After the strong reported builds in US inventories, US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US has been working to ensure the oil market is well supplied.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 -1.2% at 2822, NASDAQ-100 -1.5% at 7308, Dow Jones&nbsp; -1.1% at 25490, SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary -1.3%, Consumer Staples -0.1%, Energy -3.1%, Financials -1.5%, Health Care -0.4%, Industrials -1.6%, Information Technology -1.7%, Materials -1.5%, Telecommunication Services -1.3%, Utilities 0.8%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECFICS: </strong>Apple (APPL) shares were under pressure after news emerged that Huawei is reportedly pushing for Chinese iPhone users to switch to their own Huawei devices, as the technology co. seeks to benefit from a growing nationalist sentiment in China. Boeing (BA) fell on news that the chief of the FAA said that the US will not be rushing Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft back into the skies and had no timeline to do so. Tesla (TSLA) saw some choppy price action at the open as a leaked email from CEO Musk, claiming the electric automaker was on course to deliver a record number of vehicles this quarter, circulated, the stock price eventually settling higher on the day.

A sale of 10-year TIPS tailed 0.2bps.</p><p><strong>* DAILY FX WRAP: EUR </strong>was lower on weak EZ and German PMIs and risk-off trade saw the <strong>USD</strong> benefit. The USD’s rise was capped after its own PMIs were disappointing, and the buck subsequently gave back gains; EUR saw a YTD low, and DXY a YTD high in Thursday trade. <strong>GBP</strong> largely took its cue from EUR, though continuing speculation on when PM May will leave also added to the downside, though trades flat towards the end of the US day. <strong>JPY</strong> gathered further momentum, as the greenback weakened, and risk assets sunk, as did <strong>XAU</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>. <strong>ZAR</strong> saw downside on a dovish SARB, as well as early dollar strength, but remains tentative ahead of Friday’s S&amp;P review of the country’s finances. Perto-currencies, including <strong>CAD</strong> and <strong>RUB</strong> were dragged down by the crude complex. <strong>INR</strong> was firm after PM Modi’s victory wasbetter than anticipated. <strong>AUD </strong>and <strong>NZD</strong> were firm vs the USD after US PMI disappointed, the Aussie also supported by strong AU PMI overnight.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The outcome of the European elections looks to be priced-in, SocGen says: \"A higher share of the vote for populists is already priced in, and the question that really matters is who of the largest fractions will be put forward as candidate for the next EC president and the president of the EU Council.</p><p><strong>* ZAR: </strong>The rand was hit by both USD strength, as well as dovish SARB rate decision.

Before then, South Arican ratings will be reviewed by S&amp;P on Friday.</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> FinMin Robinson's pre-budget address outlined a shift in the stance of fiscal policy that will happen after the next election; Robinson said debt/GDP target of 20% would be met (target range for net debt is 15-25% between 2021/22), and analysts say this will ultimately allow more spending. \"This will give prudent scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy, but it will be criticised as the start of a longer-term fiscal slide,\" UBS said, but \"for short-term investors it doesn't matter much.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Composite PMI in May was above 50 for the first time since January; employment sub-indices in both the manufacturing and services PMIs also rose above the 50 handle. Aussie 10yr bond yields fell to a new all-time low sub-1.60% (down over 5bps), amid a risk-off tone to APAC trade.</p><p><strong>* INR:</strong> PM Modi's has secured a decisive majority in the Lower House, and his National Democratic Alliance coalition is on course to win 30 of the 36 state and union territories. Moving forward, Goldman Sachs sees potential structural reforms focusing on four key themes: 1) Land, transparent auctions, and digitization of records; 2) Labor, creating an enabling regulatory environment; 3) Privatization, in areas such as agriculture and banking; and 4) export promotion. Goldman does not forecast more significant monetary easing postelections, but does see substantial liquidity injections to take place in the near term. \"Moreover, we do not expect further loosening, nor serious consolidation of fiscal policy,\" GS writes, \"We would expect USDINR to continue to grind lower in coming days but remain neutral the INR on a medium-term basis.</p>",

In other words, the longer it takes for pension reform to pass congress, the greater the drag to growth in 2019. Moreover, many expected the proposal to be approved in the first half of the year, a scenario that looks increasingly unlikely given the strong opposition from leftist parties. This sentiment is echoed by TD Securities: \"the challenging political landscape in Brazil renders pension reform less likely to be passed before the summer recess\" the bank recently said.</li><li>Amid the disappointment regarding pension reform progress, the BCB Chief Neto has become increasingly dovish, and said this week that the Brazilian economy still requires stimulative monetary policy and the BRL has lost 2.5% against the US dollar in May. In that regard, TD Securities suggestion in mid-April that \"until the expected reform… we see weakness in the real taking USDBRL back to 4.20\" continues to prove an excellent call.</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul>",

The Eurozone printed disappointing PMIs, with the focus on its power-hub Germany’s manufacturing coming in below already gloomy expectations, the US later followed suit with its manufacturing and services Flash PMIs both significantly missing estimates, catalysing further downside in crude. Where the market had previously been running on the fears of conflict in the Persian Gulf and talk of sustained OPEC+ supply cuts, it appears these supply factors are playing second fiddle to the ominous global demand signals. Elsewhere in supply newsflow, further efforts are being made to resolve the Druzhba pipeline charade, Russia's Transneft said they had agreed with Belarus on a technical plan for resolving the issue, adding that there will be clean oil in Poland on June 9th/10th. After the strong reported builds in US inventories, US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US has been working to ensure the oil market is well supplied.</p>",

Heightened US-China trade tensions and associated global growth repercussions have prompted more risk aversion to the detriment of risk assets and high betas, while from a technical perspective the nearest bullish target for the DXY ahead of 98.500 is 98.496 (multi-month chart channel apex).</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Bid all day as noted above, but getting an extra lift vs the Dollar in wake of the aforementioned PMI misses and a bleak new home sales release, with the Yen rebounding firmly through 110.00 to retest recent highs around 109.80, while the Franc breached 1.0075 and inched close to 1.1200 vs the Euro that had its own PMI issues to deal with not to mention a downbeat German Ifo survey.</p><p><strong>CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The biggest G10 looser as the Loonie succumbed to the sheer scale and speed of the latest collapse in crude prices, and like on Wednesday failed to derive any real encouragement from better than expected Canadian data – wholesale trade. Indeed, Usd/Cad rebounded further from fleeting post-retail sales low circa 1.3358 to just over 1.3500 and back in sight of late April highs just above the big figure. Conversely, the <strong>NOK</strong> was less adversely impacted by oil’s drilling thanks to upbeat Norwegian jobs data and <strong>SEK </strong>even more so as the Swedish unemployment rate tumbled, though the Scandi Crowns did ease from best levels as risk sentiment soured.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The single currency and Sterling both inched closer to previously identified round numbers at 1.1100 and 1.2600 respectively, with the former undermined by pretty dire German and pan Eurozone PMIs that overshadowed more upbeat preliminary prints from France and were compounded by declines in 2 of the 3 German Ifo readings. Moreover, the institute was not very optimistic in accompanying commentary and ECB minutes were perhaps more dovish than the actual policy meeting and President Draghi in the press conference/Q&amp;A, especially on inflation that is ‘uncomfortably’ low. Eur/Usd surpassed the old ytd base, albeit marginally, at 1.1108 and Cable held just a few pips above 1.2600 before the post-PMI/housing data Buck pull-back.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The antipodean Dollars took at advantage of the Usd fade, as the Kiwi clawed its way back over 0.6500 from around 0.6482 at one stage (fresh 2019 trough, bar the flash crash) ahead of NZ trade data, while the Aussie bounced from 0.6865 to 0.6890.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Try was somewhat upstaged by the Zar, for a change, though not before the Turkish Lira weakened further to 6.1500+ in wake of a deterioration in manufacturing morale on top of the ongoing growth, inflation, fiscal and geopolitical problems afflicting assets. However, the Zar was hit harder on the back of a dovish SARB and a 3-2 vote to maintain rates with the 2 dissenters calling for a 25 bp ease, not to mention downgrades to 2019 CPI and GDP forecasts. The Rand slumped to circa 14.5325 at one stage before paring some losses with the aid of the broader Greenback fade.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Crude markets look set for a second day of hefty losses on Thursday, with rising US inventories and global demand concerns at the forefront. Hitting sentiment is the string of disappointing data out of Europe, bar France, where Flash PMIs missed the already gloomy analyst expectations, confirming fears of the slowdown in the key German manufacturing sector. On the China trade front, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said the nation will not make concessions on major issues, we aren’t sure if anything was lost in translation, but this was a pretty damming indication of where relations are sitting, squishing hopes of an oil-demand friendly resolution. Despite the recent volatility, PVM’s analyst highlight how calendar spreads have remained intact, “The USD 1/bbl backwardation on the front-end Brent is hardly a sign of an oversupplied market. The same spread in WTI is in slight contango but refuses to weaken meaningfully, not to mention that from the M2/M3 spreads onwards the market is backwardated.”</li><li>The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has released a publication on Saudi Arabia’s current dilemma in adjusting oil supply, that being maintaining US support by maintaining low oil prices, whilst on the other hand forfeiting the renewed riches it has achieved via OPEC+ supply cuts. The report notes the problems Trump could face from low crude prices, something that Saudi will be considering, “President Trump may be willing to live with slightly higher oil prices, recognizing that in a low oil price environment, US shale production growth would stall and that his key allies in the Middle East need a higher oil price to maintain government spending.” The publication highlights that crude futures are currently signalling a tight market from their steep backwardation, a reverse of the contango evident a year ago, “If 2018 is a good guide, the price level will eventually increase to reflect the current tightness in the physical market.” Furthermore, it comments on the wavering influence of demand on price movements, “Weaker-than-expected demand, especially in the first quarter of 2019, kept prices lower by USD 2/bbl, when at the same period last year strong demand accounted for 40 per cent of the price increase.” The Kingdom has a troubling task of maintaining prices in a sweet spot, where despite its best efforts, the unpredictable nature of the commodity could see violent moves in either directions.</li></ul>",

Capital Economics suggests that activity data augurs poorly, and sees a Q1 contraction, and has a non-consensus view that the SARB will cut rates later in the year (from 6.75% to 6.50% in Q4, it thinks); most analysts see rates remaining on hold through 2019.</li><li>More specifically for the SARB meeting, TD Securities notes that the market is positioned for a hold, but is gradually pricing in a rising chance of a rate cut later on this year. \"A full cut seems to be priced by January/March 2020,\" the bank says, \"we think the SARB's rhetoric will continue to be skewed to the hawkish side of market expectations, though benign inflation is likely to help the MPC soften its stance further compared to the prior March meeting.\" The bank adds that beyond this meeting, it is expecting the SARB to remain on hold until mid-2020, when it forecasts a single 25bps rate hike forthe year.</li><li>On the ZAR reaction, TD says the rand is likely to remain neutral, but political developments will have a stronger sway on USDZAR more than the MPC's decision. We still like the pair closer to 14.00 than 14.40.</li><li>Further ahead, traders are awaiting details on appointments to the full government cabinet after the recent elections, expected to be announced next week.</li></ul>",

(-1.4%)</strong> conformed to the negative tone due to the trade tensions and with some sabre-rattling from China in which Foreign Minister Wang Yi labelled US pressure on Huawei as pure economic bullying and warned they will fight to the end if the US uses extreme pressures, while China's top four official Wang Yang also suggested businesses should be prepared for a lengthy trade war. <strong>Indian markets</strong> bucked the trend and gained over 2% to record highs as the early election results showed PM Modi’s BJP and National Democratic Alliance were ahead in world’s largest democratic election with the BJP on course to achieve a majority on its own if the early results hold up. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes and with price action underpinned by safe-haven demand amid the mostly negative risk sentiment in the region.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

Equities in Europe saw a more pronounced decline amidst the release of disappointing EZ Flash PMIs and a downbeat Ifo Survey which was followed by Ifo economists stating that the export dynamic is very weak, business uncertainty remains very high and a recovery in the auto sector is not seen for the time-being. Heavy, broad-based losses are seen across the sectors; albeit healthcare, utilities and consumer staples to a lesser extent given their defensive properties. The IT sector (-2.3%) bears the brunt of a barrage of companies halting shipments to Huawei given the quarrel with the US over security, with Japanese tech giants Panasonic and Toshiba the most recent, albeit the latter announced that it has resumed shipments to the company. Nevertheless, STMicroelectronics (-4.2%), Infineon (-2.6%), Micro focus (-1.2%), SAP (-2.2%), ASML (-1.7%) shares are all pressured. In terms of individual movers, Deutsche Bank (-2.2%) shares found little reprieve as its AGM began following reports that a New York district judge has rejected US President Trump’s efforts to prevent Deutsche Bank and Capital One from complying with a congressional subpoena for the President’s financial records. Co. spokesperson said the bank remains committed to providing appropriate information regarding the investigation. At the AGM, the Co. noted that they are prepared to make tough cutbacks to their investment banking sector, and on DWS (-0.8%) they stated that they remain open to other strategic options. Finally, shares in Thomas Cook (-6.8%) plummeted after Fitch downgraded the Co.’s Long-Term Issuer Default rating to “CCC+” from “B”, outlook negative.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/SEK/NOK -</strong> The major outperformers as the Yen and Franc benefit from more safe-haven positioning, while the Scandi Crowns derive protection from broad risk-off sentiment with the aid of supportive and upbeat data to justify relatively hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank policy stances. Usd/Jpy is eyeing bids ahead of 110.00 that are said to be fairly thick and layered, while Usd/Chf is pivoting 1.0100 and the Eur/Chf cross 1.1250. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek has backed off further from recent decade highs (10.8500) towards 10.7300 and Eur/Nok is testing 9.7500 in wake of better than expected jobless rates in April and March respectively (and with Swedish unemployment falling sharply in particular).</p><p><strong>DXY -</strong> The Dollar is firmer vs the rest of the G10 after FOMC minutes underlining a patient and perhaps longer pause in normalisation than previously anticipated or flagged as it transpires that the transitory assessment on soft inflation is shared by other members aside from Powell with only a minority worried that it might unhinge expectations and warrant a rate cut. On the flip-side, there is a consensus that even if the economy develops in line with expectations it might be prudent to hold off from further tightening given ongoing risks, like trade. Hence, the index is forming a firmer base above 98.000 and inching closer to ytd peaks of 98.346 at 98.274, thus far.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/EUR/AUD/NZD -</strong> All on the backfoot relative to the Greenback, as noted above, with the Loonie unwinding more of its brief post-Canadian retail sales gains and back below 1.3450 amidst a deeper retracement in oil prices and the ongoing US-China trade spat. Meanwhile, the Pound also has the Brexit situation to contend with and a near state of political limbo given that UK PM May is still widely expected to bow to increasing pressure if not this week then sometime after the WAB returns to Parliament and rejected yet again. On that note, the HoC leader Leadsom has now resigned in protest to lift the number of MPs that have departed to 36, and with the EU elections underway Cable continues to decline, just holding above 1.2600 vs Wednesday’s circa 1.2625 base. Similarly, the single currency has slipped under yesterday’s trough and through decent option expiry interest at 1.1150 (1.4 bn) to test support ahead of the 2019 base and more expiries at the 1.1100 strike (1 bn), and more downbeat Eurozone surveys have not helped as all bar the French PMIs missed consensus and Germany’s Ifo readings were mostly downbeat. Looking down under, the Aussie and Kiwi remain rooted near or at new lows for the year, as Aud/Usd is capped ahead of 0.6900 and Nzd/Usd slips further from 0.6500 awaiting NZ trade data.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Lira has been hit by more US-Turkey sanction jitters and dire sentiment news, this time in the form of a sub-100 manufacturing index, and Usd/Try topped 6.1500 in response before paring some gains. However, the Rand is also under pressure after soft SA data that could tip the SARB towards more dovish guidance later, as Usd/Zar rebounds to 14.4900.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bunds appear to have steered debt peers on their latest leg up and added 12 more ticks to their previous Eurex best before topping out again at 167.18. Poor PMIs, France apart, and a downbeat German Ifo survey provided further impetus and probably nudged Gilts along as the 10 year UK benchmark reached 129.63 (+58 ticks) before waning, while US Treasuries are hovering just shy of their overnight peaks with the 10 year yield now down to 2.35% or so and inching further below EFFR amidst more pronounced curve inversion/flattening post-Fed minutes flagging a potentially more prolonged pause in the policy cycle and not hinting at a cut that would have boosted the short end. Ahead, weekly claims, housing data, Markit PMIs and more Fed speak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The energy complex continues its decline in the aftermath of this week’s surprise builds in US crude stocks coupled with a bleak demand outlook amid the ongoing US-China trade spat. WTI (-1.7%) futures reside just below the 60.50/bbl (having already fallen below its 50 DMA at 62.13/bbl) ahead of its 200 DMA at 60.24/bbl. Meanwhile, its Brent (-1.8%) counterpart recently slipped under its 50 DMA at 70.44/bbl, while gains are capped amid a rising Buck alongside a downbeat risk sentiment and bearish supply data as mentioned above. Elsewhere, gold (+0.2%) edges higher despite a firmer Dollar as investors seek the safe-heaven asset amid trade developments, dismal EZ flash PMIs and German confidence hitting the lowest level in over four years. Meanwhile, the risk-gauge copper (-0.4%) extends its losses with the red metal losing more ground below the 2.70/lb level ahead of its 200 DMA at 2.61/lb. Finally, ING highlights that LME nickel spreads have been tightening recently with the June/July spread trading around USD 32/t vs. USD 50/t last week. This is due to declining inventories which have fallen over 42k tonnes thus far this year, leaving inventories around the lowest levels since 2013.</p><p>Asia oil refiners are reportedly mulling cutting their output following refining margins moving to their lowest levels since 2003.

Equities in Europe saw a more pronounced decline amidst the release of disappointing EZ Flash PMIs and a downbeat Ifo Survey which was followed by Ifo economists stating that the export dynamic is very weak, business uncertainty remains very high and a recovery in the auto sector is not seen for the time-being. Heavy, broad-based losses are seen across the sectors; albeit healthcare, utilities and consumer staples to a lesser extent given their defensive properties. The IT sector (-2.3%) bears the brunt of a barrage of companies halting shipments to Huawei given the quarrel with the US over security, with Japanese tech giants Panasonic and Toshiba the most recent, albeit the latter announced that it has resumed shipments to the company. Nevertheless, STMicroelectronics (-4.0%), Infineon (-2.5%), Micro focus (-1.5%), SAP (-2.4%), ASML (-1.8%) shares are all pressured. In terms of individual movers, Deutsche Bank (-3.%) shares found little reprieve as its AGM began following reports that a New York district judge has rejected US President Trump’s efforts to prevent Deutsche Bank and Capital One from complying with a congressional subpoena for the President’s financial records. Co. spokesperson said the bank remains committed to providing appropriate information regarding the investigation. At the AGM, the Co. noted that they are prepared to make tough cutbacks to their investment banking sector, and on DWS (-1.2%) they stated that they remain open to other strategic options. Finally, shares in Thomas Cook (-7.0%) plummeted after Fitch downgraded the Co.’s Long-Term Issuer Default rating to “CCC+” from “B”, outlook negative.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/SEK/NOK</strong> - The major outperformers as the Yen and Franc benefit from more safe-haven positioning, while the Scandi Crowns derive protection from broad risk-off sentiment with the aid of supportive and upbeat data to justify relatively hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank policy stances. Usd/Jpy is eyeing bids ahead of 110.00 that are said to be fairly thick and layered, while Usd/Chf is pivoting 1.0100 and the Eur/Chf cross 1.1250. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek has backed off further from recent decade highs (10.8500) towards 10.7300 and Eur/Nok is testing 9.7500 in wake of better than expected jobless rates in April and March respectively (and with Swedish unemployment falling sharply in particular).</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The Dollar is firmer vs the rest of the G10 after FOMC minutes underlining a patient and perhaps longer pause in normalisation than previously anticipated or flagged as it transpires that the transitory assessment on soft inflation is shared by other members aside from Powell with only a minority worried that it might unhinge expectations and warrant a rate cut. On the flip-side, there is a consensus that even if the economy develops in line with expectations it might be prudent to hold off from further tightening given ongoing risks, like trade. Hence, the index is forming a firmer base above 98.000 and inching closer to ytd peaks of 98.346 at 98.274, thus far.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/EUR/AUD/NZD </strong>- All on the backfoot relative to the Greenback, as noted above, with the Loonie unwinding more of its brief post-Canadian retail sales gains and back below 1.3450 amidst a deeper retracement in oil prices and the ongoing US-China trade spat. Meanwhile, the Pound also has the Brexit situation to contend with and a near state of political limbo given that UK PM May is still widely expected to bow to increasing pressure if not this week then sometime after the WAB returns to Parliament and rejected yet again. On that note, the HoC leader Leadsom has now resigned in protest to lift the number of MPs that have departed to 36, and with the EU elections underway Cable continues to decline, just holding above 1.2600 vs Wednesday’s circa 1.2625 base. Similarly, the single currency has slipped under yesterday’s trough and through decent option expiry interest at 1.1150 (1.4 bn) to test support ahead of the 2019 base and more expiries at the 1.1100 strike (1 bn), and more downbeat Eurozone surveys have not helped as all bar the French PMIs missed consensus and Germany’s Ifo readings were mostly downbeat. Looking down under, the Aussie and Kiwi remain rooted near or at new lows for the year, as Aud/Usd is capped ahead of 0.6900 and Nzd/Usd slips further from 0.6500 awaiting NZ trade data.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Lira has been hit by more US-Turkey sanction jitters and dire sentiment news, this time in the form of a sub-100 manufacturing index, and Usd/Try topped 6.1500 in response before paring some gains. However, the Rand is also under pressure after soft SA data that could tip the SARB towards more dovish guidance later, as Usd/Zar rebounds to 14.4900.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> appear to have steered debt peers on their latest leg up and added 12 more ticks to their previous Eurex best before topping out again at 167.18. Poor PMIs, France apart, and a downbeat German Ifo survey provided further impetus and probably nudged Gilts along as the 10 year UK benchmark reached 129.63 (+58 ticks) before waning, while <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are hovering just shy of their overnight peaks with the 10 year yield now down to 2.35% or so and inching further below EFFR amidst more pronounced curve inversion/flattening post-Fed minutes flagging a potentially more prolonged pause in the policy cycle and not hinting at a cut that would have boosted the short end. Ahead, weekly claims, housing data, Markit PMIs and more Fed speak.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The energy complex continues its decline in the aftermath of this week’s surprise builds in US crude stocks coupled with a bleak demand outlook amid the ongoing US-China trade spat. <strong>WTI</strong> (-1.7%) futures reside just below the 60.50/bbl (having already fallen below its 50 DMA at 62.13/bbl) ahead of its 200 DMA at 60.24/bbl. Meanwhile, its <strong>Brent</strong> (-1.8%) counterpart recently slipped under its 50 DMA at 70.44/bbl, while gains are capped amid a rising Buck alongside a downbeat risk sentiment and bearish supply data as mentioned above. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> (+0.2%) edges higher despite a firmer Dollar as investors seek the safe-heaven asset amid trade developments, dismal EZ flash PMIs and German confidence hitting the lowest level in over four years. Meanwhile, the risk-gauge <strong>copper</strong> (-0.4%) extends its losses with the red metal losing more ground below the 2.70/lb level ahead of its 200 DMA at 2.61/lb. Finally, ING highlights that LME <strong>nickel</strong> spreads have been tightening recently with the June/July spread trading around USD 32/t vs. USD 50/t last week. This is due to declining inventories which have fallen over 42k tonnes thus far this year, leaving inventories around the lowest levels since 2013.</p>",

This approximates to -10 bp in cash terms and could offer some sentimental or psychological support, although the yield has been several bp deeper below parity and the overall mood is risk-off again due to heightened US-China tensions, alongside geopolitical factors and of course Brexit as EU Parliamentary elections begin. Ahead, preliminary PMIs, German Ifo survey, ECB minutes and speakers all on a busy agenda.</p>",

The usual concoction of trade sentiment, Brexit jitters, and Fedspeak were cited (on the latter, there were upticks on remarks from Fed's Bullard, who after overnight saying he did not see the need to cut rates, added that if inflation weakens, he would not rule out a rate cut this year). There was very little reaction to the FOMC meeting minutes, where the message was that the Fed does not plan to raise rates even if the economy evolves in line with their projections, though a few wanted to see tightening in this scenario; there was no discussion of rate cuts, it appears. The implied probability of a rate cut in 2019 fell from around 68% to 66% in wake of the release, according to the CME's Fedwatch. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed.

        "content": "<p>Asia stock indices are lower amid spillover selling from Wall St as US-China trade uncertainty remains at the forefront of market focus with the US mulling restrictions on several Chinese firms and as comments from China suggested and unwillingness to back down, as well as the potential for a prolonged trade dispute. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are negative with Australia dragged by weakness in its largest weighted financials sector and with energy names pressured after a more than 3% drop in WTI, while risk appetite in Tokyo is suppressed by a stronger currency and weak Nikkei Manufacturing PMI data which slipped into contraction territory. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) are negative as US mulls restrictions on several Chinese companies and with some sabre-rattling from China in which Foreign Minister Wang Yi labelled US pressure on Huawei as pure economic bullying and warned they will fight to the end if the US uses extreme pressures, while China's top four official Wang Yang also suggested businesses should be prepared for a lengthy trade war.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY trades mildly firmer and above 98.00 in the aftermath of an uneventful FOMC minutes in which Fed officials noted a patient approach for rate policy would likely be appropriate for some time even if global conditions keep improving, although a few members suggested policy may need to be tightened if the economy evolves as expected. Meanwhile, the greenback’s major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD rangebound near a large option expiry at 1.1150 ahead of today’s European Parliament Elections and GBP/USD languishes around 4-month lows as PM May hangs by a thread to her position amid ever-increasing pressure for her resignation. Talk was circulating PM May could step down last night, although this failed to materialise and was dismissed by a government source, while she is set to meet with 1922 Committee Chair Brady on Friday to discuss leadership changes and then a decision will be made, while some Cabinet sources do not expect her to last beyond Monday. Furthermore, PM May also suffered the resignation of House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom as she no longer believes PM May's approach will deliver on the referendum result and the government was said to be seriously considering pulling the WAB following the backlash. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is pressured by the risk averse tone and antipodeans weakened due to their high-beta characteristics, with AUD/USD also weighed as the Australian 10yr yield declined to its lowest on record ahead of a widely anticipated rate cut next month.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the upside in T-notes with price action underpinned by safe-haven demand.</p>",
