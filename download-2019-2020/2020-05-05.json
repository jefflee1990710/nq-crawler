However, there was a significant reversal in the last hour of trade amid the SPX failing to break through the 2,900 figure and perhaps due to some cautious comments from Fed’s Clarida, participants also draw attention to lighter liquidity conditions in late trade. More broadly, there is an argument among analysts that the trough may be in, leaving focus on how quickly the economy can come back online, and to what extent business and consumer behaviour normalises. In the pre-market, a ruling from the German constitutional court on the ECB’s asset purchases dented the equity rally, but did not derail it, and sentiment was firm as US players arrived. ISM non-manufacturing data was grim but the headline came in better than forecast, flattered by supplier deliveries, although the main three sub-indexes were dire; in wake of the data, ES futures continued their ascent, with some suggestion that shorts may have been closing positions too, though the rally stalled around 2890-2900 zone, which seems to be a key level implied by valuations (next year’s forward EPS estimate of USD 170, assume a p/e of 17x = 2,890). Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has reportedly been approached by AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC), which is interested in acquiring its drug distribution business, according to sources. LBrands (LB) officially announced its deal with Sycamore Partners regarding Victoria Secret has been terminated. Hertz (HTZ) has reportedly hired an additional adviser to help with its planned bankruptcy filing, according to sources. Starbucks (SBUX) expects 85% of its stores in the US to be opened by the end of the week and over 90% by June. Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) announced the first lot of patients have been dosed in its phase 1/2 clinical trial for a COVID-19 treatment. SPX +0.9% at 2868, NDX +1.1% at 8930, DJIA +0.6% at 23,883.</p><p>Yields moved modestly higher in a steepening fashion as a positive risk tone and supply weighed on the curve. The 10-year yield rose to as high as 67bps overnight, with pressure remaining on the TPLEX in the European session amid the weakness seen in EGBs after the German court ruling. However, as Europeans departed yields gradually pared some of their rise, with the 10-year finding its floor around the 65bps area (BMO’s analysts have identified the 0.60-0.65% yield zone as the key range within the broader 0.54-0.78% range). Further retracement was unlikely given the continued ramp-up of corporate issuance post-earnings (May is traditionally the busiest month of the year for IG offerings), as well as the Treasury’s refunding announcement (due Wednesday) after it noted it would be raising a record USD 3trln on Monday. Meanwhile, a strong SPX rally also muted the appetite for haven debt. By settlement major curve spreads were slightly steeper, with 2s unchanged at 0.19%, 5s +1bps at 0.37%, 10s +2bps at 0.66%, and 30s +3bps at 1.33%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 3+ ticks lower at 138-27+.</p>",

However, there was a significant reversal in the last hour of trade amid the SPX failing to break through the 2,900 figure and perhaps due to some cautious comments from Fed’s Clarida, participants also draw attention to lighter liquidity conditions in late trade. More broadly, there is an argument among analysts that the trough may be in, leaving focus on how quickly the economy can come back online, and to what extent business and consumer behaviour normalises. In the pre-market, a ruling from the German constitutional court on the ECB’s asset purchases dented the equity rally, but did not derail it, and sentiment was firm as US players arrived. ISM non-manufacturing data was grim but the headline came in better than forecast, flattered by supplier deliveries, although the main three sub-indexes were dire; in wake of the data, ES futures continued their ascent, with some suggestion that shorts may have been closing positions too, though the rally stalled around 2890-2900 zone, which seems to be a key level implied by valuations (next year’s forward EPS estimate of USD 170, assume a p/e of 17x = 2,890). There was not much else added to the macro narrative as we await this week’s jobs data (ADP tomorrow, IJC Thursday, NFP on Friday) and central bank activity (BOE Thursday). Elsewhere, the Treasury curve bear-steepened, the dollar took advantage of another soggy day for the WUR (but even before the EUR sharp downside after the German court decision, DXY was respecting 50dma support); commodity FX was also higher, as crude continues to rise, with Brent futures settling above USD 30 bucks.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>GERMAN COURT RULING: </strong>German Court did not find the ECB’s PSPP violated the prohibition of monetary financing, although it did rule it did not respect the “Principle of proportionality” where the ECB now have 3-months to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank “may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue”. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-german-constitutional-court-ruling-did-not-find-the-ecb-s-pspp-violated-the-prohibition-on-monetary-financing-although-it-does-not-respect-the-principle-of-proportionality-05-05-2020\">Click here for full analysis</a>.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US STIMULUS:</strong> Senate Majority Leader McConnell stated Senate Republicans are not ruling out further stimulus but think that a pause is necessary to evaluate how current measures are working. This is not the first time he has been opposed to stimulus measures, in an interview with Axios, he noted he would not support an infrastructure bill in the COIVD-19 stimulus package. There has also been some feeling among GOP’s that the Democrats are exploiting the crisis to raise spending in some areas they have been pursuing for some time. Elsewhere, he noted Republicans are working on a “narrowly crafted” lawsuit liability bill that “will not protect somebody from gross negligence”.</p><p><strong>US/UK TRADE:</strong> “Accelerated” trade talks between the two nations officially started today with both sides showing a willingness and the two sides are looking for a deal which increases output and jobs by adjusting trade restrictions and costs. The talks come ahead of the Brexit extension deadline which is edging closer with the UK seemingly still keen to leave at the end of this year and not request an extension by the deadline. The accelerated nature of the talks could perhaps be to get a deal through in case of a potential fallout of EU talks.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>Fed Vice Chair Clarida took a rather cautious tone noting we are living through the most severe contraction in activity and extreme levels of unemployment we have ever seen, largely echoing Fed Chair Powell. Clarida noted that the recovery could begin in H2 of this year, but it will take time, adding programmes can be expanded as needed and it may be the case that more policy support is needed from both monetary and fiscal sides. Fed’s Bullard (dove, non-voter) stated rates will remain low for years and not months, but he believes the market expects that. Bullard feels unemployment can come down substantially by year-end if the stimulus programmes work as planned. Fed’s Bostic (non-voter) on the recovery said it is very hard to know the shape and that a V-shaped recovery is difficult to achieve in many areas in the US. Fed’s Evans (non-voter) stated that future steps might include elements of Yield Curve Control (YCC). Note, YCC is expected by analysts where some had hoped for some sort of guidance in the latest FOMC decision, although many are looking towards the June meeting to see any language surrounding YCC.</p><p><strong>RBA </strong>kept rates at 0.25% as expected and maintained 3yr yield target at 0.25%, RBA said the board will not raise the cash rate target until the economy meets inflation and employment goals, while it will maintain efforts in keeping funding costs low and credit available. RBA stated that containment measures have reduced infection rates across countries and if this continues, a recovery in the global economy will start later this year. Furthermore, it sees output falling 10% in H1 and by around 6% for the year before rebounding 6% next year in its baseline scenario but noted that a stronger recovery is possible if there is further substantial progress in containing coronavirus in the near-term.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 4.17 HIGHER AT USD 24.56/BBL, WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 3.71 HIGHER AT USD 26.49/BBL; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 3.77 HIGHER AT USD 30.97/BBL.</strong></p><p>Further bullish exuberance in the crude market saw front month futures lead the pack, seeing Brent cross the USD 30/bbl handle for the first time since April 15th. The physical market backdrop remains little changed, as it did in the prior four consecutive sessions of oil gains, although investor sentiment is clearly taking a turn. Sceptics continue to highlight the increasing inventories which edge closer to storage capacity, albeit recent data suggests a declining rate of growth. Meanwhile, US President Trump commented, “Oil prices moving up nicely as demand begins again!” Elsewhere, Vitol CEO said it sees a fragile recovery beginning in crude markets, and sees demand down 8mln BPD Y/Y. The CEO also said that he sees oil stocks building through June before de-stocking starts in July; expects North America output cuts to exceed 3mln BPD from March to May.</p><p><strong>OPEC+:</strong> Some OPEC+ states are already in pain because of the cuts, according to Energy Intel, and are calling for G20 countries outside the alliance to formally commit to production cuts, rather than letting privately-owned companies make their own decisions. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports in May are expected to be about 6mln BPD, the lowest in a decade; domestic refining output in May is likely to drop and industrial activity is to be weak due to the lockdown, sources reported. At the same time, Saudi Aramco has delayed its June Official Selling Price (OSP) release to Wednesday.</p><p><strong>INVENTORIES: </strong>Participants will now be looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, with the private report due later Tuesday ahead of the official release on Wednesday. Bulls will be looking for further evidence of a declining rate of growth of inventories to support the recent price reversal. Current expectations (bbls): crude +7.8mln (prev. +9mln), gasoline +0.04mln (prev. -3.67mln), distillates +2.9mln (prev. +5.1mln).</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-27+</strong></p><p>Yields moved modestly higher in a steepening fashion as a positive risk tone and supply weighed on the curve. The 10-year yield rose to as high as 67bps overnight, with pressure remaining on the TPLEX in the European session amid the weakness seen in EGBs after the German court ruling. However, as Europeans departed yields gradually pared some of their rise, with the 10-year finding its floor around the 65bps area (BMO’s analysts have identified the 0.60-0.65% yield zone as the key range within the broader 0.54-0.78% range). Further retracement was unlikely given the continued ramp-up of corporate issuance post-earnings (May is traditionally the busiest month of the year for IG offerings), as well as the Treasury’s refunding announcement (due Wednesday) after it noted it would be raising a record USD 3trln on Monday. Meanwhile, a strong SPX rally also muted the appetite for haven debt. By settlement major curve spreads were slightly steeper, with 2s unchanged at 0.19%, 5s +1bps at 0.37%, 10s +2bps at 0.66%, and 30s +3bps at 1.33%.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p>ISM NON-MANUFACTURING (APR): Headline PMI fell from 52.5 to 41.8, the lowest since March 2009, although fared better than expected. However, once again the headline was supported by a jump in the supplier deliveries index, which registered an all-time high of 78.3, flattering the index headline; respondents noted that deliveries were slipping due to slower production windows and increased demand on delivery resources. Elsewhere in the report, the internals were grim: Business Activity fell to 26 from 48, an all-time low. New Orders tumbled to 32.9 from 52.9 in March, while the employment index fell to 30 from 47, once again boding poorly for Friday’s jobs report. Pantheon Macroeconomics writes “in short, this is a terrible report”. However, the consultancy notes the May report should not fare as poorly as it would consider the gradual reopening of economies in roughly half of the states.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.9% at 2868, NDX +1.1% at 8930, DJIA +0.6% at 23,883.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Health Care +2.2%, IT +1.4%, Utilities +0.9%, Real Estate +0.6%, Communications +0.5%, Industrials +0.4%, Consumer Discretionary +0.4%, Materials +0.3%, Energy +0.3%, Consumer Staples +0.1%, Financials -0.1%.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Skyworks (SWKS) beat on EPS and revenue although Q3 guidance was light. Regeneron (REGN) beat on EPS and revenue while noting “Novel SARS-CoV-2 antibody “cocktail” treatment advancing rapidly, and it is planning clinical studies for June. Sysco (SYY) beat on EPS, revenue was inline. It noted Trends this month have shown sequential improvement compared to the low point and expects this to continue through to May. AIG (AIG) missed on EPS, although Net Written Premiums were firmer, JP Morgan (JPM) noted that although the results were weak, they were not as weak as presumed from a first glance. Newmont Gold (NEM) missed on EPS and revenue while reporting gold production was up 20% to 1.5mln oz. In the conference call, it expects Q2 to hold the largest adverse impact on its financial performance and operations for 2020.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has reportedly been approached by AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC), which is interested in acquiring its drug distribution business, according to sources. LBrands (LB) officially announced its deal with Sycamore Partners regarding Victoria Secret has been terminated. Hertz (HTZ) has reportedly hired an additional adviser to help with its planned bankruptcy filing, according to sources. Starbucks (SBUX) expects 85% of its stores in the US to be opened by the end of the week and over 90% by June. Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) announced the first lot of patients have been dosed in its phase 1/2 clinical trial for a COVID-19 treatment. United Continental Holdings (UAL) is reportedly planning to cut at least 3,400 positions from its management and administrative teams (about 30%) in October and has also told pilots to prepare for changes, according to a memo. Marriott (MAR) raised USD 920mln in cash through amendments to co-brand credit card agreements with JPMorgan (JPM) and American Express (AXP); terminates USD 1.5bln 1-year revolving credit facility it announced on April 14th.</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>Petro currencies outperform as Brent settles above USD30/bbl for the first time since mid-April</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> On course for a second day of gains, following a run of 7 straight down days. With the Chinese and Japanese away, it is hard to read too much into USD moves in thinner liquidity conditions; tomorrow’s PBOC fixing will be eyed to see how Chinese authorities discount the latest tensions between US/China. Citi’s analysts think that USD strength might have further to run for four reasons: i) positioning is now clean for the USD; ii) month-end selling out the way; iii) global risks skew more negative, and; iv) seasonality tends to favour USD in May (which other analysts have said is due to higher USD issuance in May bringing out foreign demand).</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The RBA overnight kept rates unchanged at 0.25%, and the 3-year yield target at 0.25%, with the Governor, again reiterating that no changes to rates are likely until its inflation and labour market objectives have been met. The Bank expanded the securities it will accept in liquidity operations to include investment-grade corporate bonds, however. Growth is seen contracting by 6% in 2020, while inflation could go negative next year – the RBA’s SOMP report will be published Friday with more details. SocGen notes that the Aussie saw its best monthly rebound in April since March 2016, but tensions between the US/China could be a negative for commodities and the AUD, and taking a long-term view, SG says remains sceptical of a durable return to higher levels until AUDUSD manages to squeeze back over 0.6850.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Another down day for the single currency, although the German Court did not find the ECB’s PSPP violated the prohibition of monetary financing, although it did rule it did not respect the “Principle of proportionality” where the ECB now have 3-months to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank “may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue. The ruling combined with solid dollar gains saw EURUSD find support at 1.0825.</p><p><strong>CHF:</strong> Swiss deflation rose to the highest since January 2016, and with Y/Y inflation at -1.1%, it is 0.5ppts beneath the SNB’s -0.6% Y/Y average forecast for Q2. While the SNB has increased its intervention in FX markets of late, as indicated by the weekly sight deposits data, analysts believe that it will still need to do more to prevent EURCHF from again dipping sub 1.05.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen was firmer against the greenback despite the risk-on appetite and firmer buck; however, given Golden Week is still ongoing,&nbsp; liquidity is thin while the narrative has not changed too much from yesterday. The cross seemingly found support at 106.50; JPMorgan highlights support levels beneath between 106.20/25 with 107.00/10 as resistance above.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling was fairly unreactive today while “accelerated” UK/US trade talks have officially begun. Analysts were paying particular attention to EURGBP; Natixis noted technical indicators have become more upbeat on the cross noting it points towards a pronounced recovery of the pair over the next few trading sessions, while ING on the fundamental side suggested that GBP upside should be limited heading into the June transition period extension deadline suggesting it is unlikely the cross will persistently break below 0.87 in the coming weeks. And GBP was lagging when compared to high beta names (AUD, NZD, CAD, SEK all up 0.4-0.5% against the buck, while GBP was flat).</p><p><strong>CAD, NZD, SEK:</strong> The cyclicals once again performed well, tracking risk sentiment, while CAD saw an extra tailwind from the firmer oil prices, ignoring trade which data printed a narrower deficit than expected, but widened from the prior. On oil, Scotiabank highlights that demand and pricing for Canadian heavy crude has risen, seeing the Western Canada Select (WCS) differential to WTI narrow to the lowest since 2008. The bank writes this may give CAD further leverage to gains in crude. Elsewhere, SEK also found some solace after GDP was on relatively stable ground before the worst of the coronavirus contagion impacted.</p><p><strong>PETRO/EMFX:</strong> Petro currencies (MXN, NOK, RUB) outperformed thanks to the jump in oil prices, where Brent settled above USD 30. Elsewhere BRL continues to lag amid ongoing political woes in the region while Treasury Secretary Almeida noted taxes will have to be risen if the spending ceiling is broken, adding the fall in GDP this year will be big, but no one knows how big.</p>",

The 10-year yield rose to as high as 67bps overnight, with pressure remaining on the TPLEX in the European session amid the weakness seen in EGBs after the German court ruling. However, as Europeans departed yields gradually pared some of their rise, with the 10-year finding its floor around the 65bps area (BMO’s analysts have identified the 0.60-0.65% yield zone as the key range within the broader 0.54-0.78% range). Further retracement was unlikely given the continued ramp up of corporate issuance post-earnings (May is traditionally the busiest month of the year for IG offerings), as well as the Treasury’s refunding announcement (due Wednesday) after it noted it would be raising a record USD 3trln on Monday. Meanwhile, a strong SPX rally also muted the appetite for haven debt. By settlement major curve spreads were slightly steeper, with 2s unchanged at 0.19%, 5s +1bps at 0.37%, 10s +2bps at 0.66%, and 30s +3bps at 1.33%.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD:</strong> On course for a second day of gains, following a run of 7 straight down days. With the Chinese and Japanese away, it is hard to read too much into USD moves in thinner liquidity conditions; tomorrow’s PBOC fixing will be eyed to see how Chinese authorities discount the latest tensions between US/China. Citi's analysts think that USD strength might have further to run for four reasons: i) positioning is now clean for the USD; ii) month-end selling out the way; iii) global risks skew more negative, and; iv) seasonality tends to favour USD in May (which other analysts have said is due to higher USD issuance in May bringing out foreign demand).</p><p><strong>AUD: </strong>The RBA overnight kept rates unchanged at 0.25%, and the 3-year yield target at 0.25%, with the Governor again reiterating that no changes to rates are likely until its inflation and labour market objectives have been met. The Bank expanded the securities it will accept in liquidity operations to include investment grade corporate bonds, however. Growth is seen contracting by 6% in 2020, while inflation could go negative next year – the RBA’s SOMP report will be published Friday with more details. SocGen notes that the Aussie saw its best monthly rebound in April since March 2016, but tensions between the US/China could be a negative for commodities and the AUD, and taking a long-term view, SG says remains sceptical of a durable return to higher levels until AUDUSD manages to squeeze back over 0.6850. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>Another down day for the single currency, although the German Court did not find the ECB’s PSPP violated the prohibition of monetary financing, although it did rule it did not respect the “Principle of proportionality” where the ECB now have 3-months to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank “may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue. The ruling combined with solid dollar gains saw EURUSD find support at 1.0825.</p><p><strong>CHF: </strong>Swiss deflation rose to the highest since January 2016, and with Y/Y inflation at -1.1%, it is 0.5ppts beneath the SNB’s -0.6% Y/Y average forecast for Q2. While the SNB has increased its intervention in FX markets of late, as indicated by the weekly sight deposits data, analysts believe that it will still need to do more to prevent EURCHF from again dipping sub 1.05.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen was firmer against the greenback despite the risk on appetite and firmer buck; however, given Golden Week is still ongoing, &nbsp;liquidity is thin while the narrative has not changed too much from yesterday. The cross seemingly found support at 106.50; JPMorgan highlights support levels beneath between 106.20/25 with 107.00/10 as resistance above.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Sterling was fairly unreactive today while “accelerated” UK/US trade talks have officially begun. Analysts were paying particular attention on EURGBP; Natixis noted technical indicators have become more upbeat on the cross noting it points towards a pronounced recovery of the pair over the next few trading sessions, while ING on the fundamental side suggested that GBP upside should be limited heading into the June transition period extension deadline suggesting it is unlikely the cross will persistently break below 0.87 in the coming weeks.&nbsp;And GBP was lagging when compared to high beta names (AUD, NZD, CAD, SEK all up 0.4-0.5% against the buck, while GBP was flat).</p><p><strong>CAD, NZD, SEK: </strong>The cyclicals once again performed well, tracking risk sentiment, while CAD saw an extra tailwind from the firmer oil prices, ignoring trade which data printed a narrower deficit than expected, but widened from the prior. On oil, Scotiabank highlights that demand and pricing for Canadian heavy crude has risen, seeing the Western Canada Select (WCS) differential to WTI narrow to the lowest since 2008. The bank writes this may give CAD further leverage to gains in crude. Elsewhere, SEK also found some solace after GDP was on relatively stable ground before the worst of the coronavirus contagion impacted.</p><p><strong>PETRO/EMFX: </strong>Petro currencies (MXN, NOK, RUB) outperformed thanks to the jump in oil prices, where Brent settled above USD 30. Elsewhere BRL continues to lag amid ongoing political woes in the region while Treasury Secretary Almeida noted taxes will have to be risen if the spending ceiling is broken, adding the fall in GDP this year will be big, but no one knows how big.</p>",

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's crude oil exports in May are expected to be about 6mln BPD, the lowest in a decade; domestic refining output in May is likely to drop and industrial activity is to be weak due to the lockdown, sources reported. At the same time, Saudi Aramco has delayed its June Official Selling Price (OSP) release to Wednesday.</p><p><strong>INVENTORIES: </strong>Participants will now be looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, with the private report due later Tuesday ahead of the official release on Wednesday.

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>The German Constitutional Court did not find the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) in violation of the prohibition on monetary financing but ruled that the programme did not respect the “principle of proportionality”, suggesting it went too far with the mandate – thus violating German law. The “proportionality” in question refers to the effect of the monetary policy objectives of the PSPP to economic and fiscal policy; specifically, the unconditional pursuit of inflation close to but below 2% while ignoring subsequent arising policy effects. As such, the court issued a three-month ultimatum to the ECB to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank \"may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue\".&nbsp;</li><li>Furthermore, the condition states “[The] Bundesbank must ensure that the bonds already purchased and held in its portfolio are sold based on a – possibly long-term – strategy coordinated with the Eurosystem”. That being said, today’s decision does not concern the recently introduced Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), or any measures relating explicitly to COVID-19. The European Commission responded by stating that European top court (ECJ) rulings are binding for all national courts; and added EU law has primacy over national laws.&nbsp;</li><li>The ECB Governing Council took note of the ruling but reiterated its pledge to being fully committed to do everything necessary within its mandate, adding the ECJ ruled in its favour in 2018 that it is acting within its price stability mandate.&nbsp;</li><li>Desks note that a response from the ECB is likely to arise sooner rather than later given the pandemic situations and the need to subside uncertainty. &nbsp;However, some participants noted that the border between monetary policy and economic implications cannot be defined, potentially leaving the door for the GCC to decide on the border on its own. Furthermore, the ECB’s pledge to “do whatever it takes” may be hindered by the conditions attached to the ruling. Pantheon Macro notes that as far as they understand it, the ECJ will have the final say on the matter and ultimately it will \"all blow over\". However, the court ruling certainly raises concerns over the ECB's more recent initiatives which are even more creative than the one ruled on today.&nbsp;</li><li>Focus ahead is now on the ECB’s response and how they intend to clarify the issue, as well as from a technical perspective whether the GCC would then need to issue a subsequent ruling to this; additionally, some have posited that in theory, another member’s Central Bank could effectively take over from the Bundesbank and purchase the German PSPP – albeit this is complicated. Some fear that the ruling could open the door to similar cases in countries that are just as inclined, thus further threatening European unity.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

However, once again the headline was supported by a jump in the supplier deliveries index, which registered an all-time high of 78.3, flattering the index headline; respondents noted that deliveries were slipping due to slower production windows and increased demand on delivery resources. Elsewhere in the report, the internals were grim: Business Activity fell to 26 from 48, an all time low. New Orders tumbled to 32.9 from 52.9 in March, while the employment index fell to 30 from 47, once again boding poorly for Friday’s jobs report. Pantheon Macroeconomics writes “in short, this is a terrible report”. However, the consultancy notes the May report should not fare as poorly as it would consider the gradual reopening of economies in roughly half of the states.</p>",

Communication Services saw the biggest outflows for the second straight week, led by another week of record selling of the sector by hedge funds.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY AND ENERGY: </strong>BofA’s flow report notes that ETFs saw outflows across asset classes except for commodity ETFs, which saw a seventh consecutive week of inflows. “Equity ETFs saw broad-based selling across all size and style segments; by sector, Real Estate ETFs have the longest selling streak at eight weeks, while Energy ETFs have the longest buying streak (ten weeks),” the bank notes.</p>",

The COVID narrative is driving the optimism, after decent data from NY State on Monday, and as some US states begin exiting lockdowns, and positive commentary about treatments also flows. US equity futures are higher, though the ES is off highs of 2865 seen overnight (corresponding high for the NQ was 8917), with downside seen in wake of the German Constitutional Court ruled that some ECB actions held illegal and not valid in Germany; ECB's decisions are not backed by EU Treaty (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/german-constitutional-court-did-not-find-ecb-s-pspp-to-be-in-violation-of-prohibition-on-monetary-financing-some-ecb-actions-held-illegal-and-not-valid-in-germany-ecb-s-decisions-are-not-backed-by-eu-treaty-05-05-2020\">details here</a>).

Meanwhile, gold is a touch lower, activity currencies have a bias towards higher, oil exporters are higher, EMFX is slightly up.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors opened in positive territory, with energy leading the pack amid firmer oil prices, while French oil giant Total (TOT, FP FP) announced it plans to pay a steady dividend, adding it can break-even even with low oil prices. Spanish oil firm Repsol (REP SM) also maintained its dividend. Cyclicals leading the way with technology and financials among top three performers. For Semiconductors (SOX), DigiTimes reports that there is speculation that Samsung (SSNLF) 5nm EUV process attracted orders from Nvidia (NVDA), although sources believe TSMC (TSM) will remain the major foundry partner of the chip. Defensives lagging today albeit still in positive territory.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Skyworks (SWKS) beat on EPS and revenue although Q3 guidance was light.

Sysco (SYY) beat on EPS, revenue was inline. It noted Trends this month have shown sequential improvement compared to the low point and expects this to continue through to May. AIG (AIG) missed on EPS, although Net Written Premiums were firmer, JP Morgan (JPM) noted that although the results were weak, they were not as weak as presumed from a first glance. Newmont Gold (NEM) missed on EPS and revenue while reporting gold production was up 20% to 1.5mln oz. In the conference call, it expects Q2 to hold the largest adverse impact on its financial performance and operations for 2020.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has reportedly been approached by AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC), which is interested in acquiring its drug distribution business, according to sources.

Starbucks (SBUX) expects 85% of its stores in the US to be opened by the end of the week and over 90% by June. Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) announced the first lot of patients have been dosed in its phase 1/2 clinical trial for a COVID-19 treatment.

The bank notes that there are some sectors that the model seems to permanently underweight, such as Energy, Health Care, Financials and Real Estate; “In most cases this is due the low free cashflow yields of these sectors, in some cases, such as Health Care, investors may wish to overwrite the model given the structural driver of an aging population globally.”</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://newsquawk.com/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/317eb99d-4148-431f-be08-1e83d662139c.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>BEWARE SHORT COVERING: </strong>Citi's strategists note that Emini futures are running at 54% of 10-days average volume, and according to its CTA model, the bank warns that we could see shorts cover around the 2867 region.</p><p><strong>SPX/NDX TECHS: </strong>Credit Suisse technicians note that the S&amp;P 500 held support from its rising 13-day average on a closing basis (~2831), \"but we look for resistance from the top of the price gap seen Friday at 2912/18 to now ideally cap further strength from here and we maintain our topping scenario.\" On the Nasdaq 100, CS notes the index has again held key near-term price and 13-day average support centred on 8669, and says that a break below here would be needed to confirm a near-term top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Bunds have faded from 174.55, Gilts are holding just below 137.87 and the 10 year T-note midway between 138-20-30+ extremes awaiting the Wall Street open, Markit services PMI and ISM equivalent before the ECB’s response to the GCC and late Fed speakers.</p>",

The COVID narrative is driving the optimism, after decent data from NY State on Monday, and as some US states begin exiting lockdowns, and positive commentary about treatments also flows. US equity futures are higher, though the ES is off highs of 2865 seen overnight (corresponding high for the NQ was 8917), with downside seen in wake of the German Constitutional Court ruled that some ECB actions held illegal and not valid in Germany; ECB's decisions are not backed by EU Treaty (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/german-constitutional-court-did-not-find-ecb-s-pspp-to-be-in-violation-of-prohibition-on-monetary-financing-some-ecb-actions-held-illegal-and-not-valid-in-germany-ecb-s-decisions-are-not-backed-by-eu-treaty-05-05-2020\">details here</a>). The USD firmed in wake of that decision out of Germany, but even before the decision the 99.30 support seen over the last couple of sessions was holding. Meanwhile, gold is a touch lower, activity currencies have a bias towards higher, oil exporters are higher, EMFX is slightly up.</p><p><strong>SECTOR ROTATION: </strong>UBS quants say that their sector rotation model (which has generated 2.4% per annum long vs market and 6.3% per annum long/short in the US) is currently most overweight Utilities, Consumer Staples, Information Technology, and underweight Energy, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary in the US. The bank notes that there are some sectors that the model seems to permanently underweight, such as Energy, Health Care, Financials and Real Estate; “In most cases this is due the low free cashflow yields of these sectors, in some cases, such as Health Care, investors may wish to overwrite the model given the structural driver of an aging population globally.”</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/317eb99d-4148-431f-be08-1e83d662139c.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>BEWARE SHORT COVERING: </strong>Citi's strategists note that Emini futures are running at 54% of 10-days average volume, and according to its CTA model, the bank warns that we could see shorts cover around the 2867 region.</p><p><strong>SPX/NDX TECHS: </strong>Credit Suisse technicians note that the S&amp;P 500 held support from its rising 13-day average on a closing basis (~2831), \"but we look for resistance from the top of the price gap seen Friday at 2912/18 to now ideally cap further strength from here and we maintain our topping scenario.\" On the Nasdaq 100, CS notes the index has again held key near-term price and 13-day average support centred on 8669, and says that a break below here would be needed to confirm a near-term top.</p><p><strong>NON-MANUFACTURING ISM:</strong> Analysts expect the ISM non-manufacturing PMI headline to fall to 36.8 in April (the range of forecasts is wide at 30.0-47.6, indicating a great deal of uncertainty in the estimates) from 52.5 in March. If the consensus is right, the index will drop beneath even the low seen in the Great Financial Crisis (an all-time low of 37.8 in November 2008), and would be the largest single month fall on record. The three key sub-components (business activity, new orders, and employment) are expected to fall, as signalled by the collapse in the March retail sales data. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-ism-april-non-manufacturing-survey-due-1000-et-1500-bst-index-could-fall-to-an-all-time-low-beware-survey-quirks-that-might-flatter-the-headline-05-05-2020\">Preview here</a>.</p>",

As such, <strong>ASX 200 (+1.6%)</strong> is higher with the energy names mirroring the outperformance of the sector stateside on continued gains in oil prices and with strength seen across all of the big 4 banks, while Afterpay Touch extended on its rally after Tencent recently became a substantial shareholder in the Co. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.1%)</strong> was also underpinned by the improved risk tone and following comments from Chief Executive Lam who stated the time has come to ease social distancing measures and that she will announce the easing of restrictions as soon as possible.

Should the ECB fail to show this, then the Bundesbank may no longer participate in PSPP. On the release, DAX cash slipped from around 11,700 to around 10,6200 before continuing to trickle lower before finding a recent base just above 10,500. Sectors are all in the green with outperformance in the energy sector as the oil market continues its upwards trajectory. Some defensive sectors also lag cyclicals – with the exception of Healthcare. The sector breakdown also paints a similar picture with Oil &amp; Gas and Basic Resources the top performers – whilst Household Goods and Food &amp; Beverages reside on the other side of the spectrum. In terms of individual movers Infineon (+2.5%) rises post-earnings despite mixed numbers as the group issued earnings following its withdrawal earlier in the year.

However, some of the Bank’s actions are deemed to be illegal and not backed by the EU Treaty, so the Senate has set a 3 month deadline for the GC to clearly define PSPP proportionality in the context of associated economic and fiscal effects, after which time the Bundesbank may not be permitted to participate in the asset purchase scheme, or reinvestment following the transition period. Eur/Usd has subsequently slumped towards 1.0800 and support seen around 1.0800, with the DXY eyeing 100.000 given the Euro’s hefty weighting in the index.</p><p><strong>CHF - </strong>The Franc has extended declines against the Greenback to sub-0.9700 in wake of downbeat Swiss data and survey releases in the form of CPI and consumer confidence both turning more negative, but Eur/Chf has retreated further towards 1.0500 on the aforementioned Euro depreciation that may also have implications for the PEPP.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/AUD/CAD - </strong>Relative G10 outperformers, as the Norwegian Crown draws more momentum from oil’s continued recovery and the aforementioned Euro weakness to retest 11.2000, while the Swedish Krona takes some encouragement from preliminary Q1 GDP metrics showing resilience the economy before the anticipated COVID-19 demise, with Eur/Sek hovering just above 10.7000. Elsewhere, the Aussie is holding a portion of its post-RBA gains following unchanged rates, albeit off overnight peaks when stops were tripped beyond 0.6450, and the Loonie is also benefiting from the more pronounced rebound in crude prices within a 1.4030-95 range ahead of Canadian and US trade reports.</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/JPY - </strong>All struggling to contend with Buck’s revival at the expense of the Euro in large part, but Cable has taken comfort from an upward tweak to the UK’s services PMI and Eur/Gbp’s reversal through the 200 DMA to stay afloat between 1.2420-85 parameters. Conversely, the Kiwi is being hampered somewhat by cross-winds given upside in Aud/Nzd from the low 1.0600 area to just shy of 1.0650 after the RBA, but pivoting 0.6050 vs its US counterpart in advance of NZ Q1 labour data tonight. Meanwhile, the Yen remains entrenched in Japanese holiday trade within a 106.50-90 band and waiting for the end of Golden Week that ends just in time for NFP on Friday.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Little respite for the Lira as attempts to pare losses become less compelling and shallower into the 7.0000 handle, with Usd/Try increasingly more inclined to extend the break and target record peaks not seen since Turkey’s economic, fiscal and currency crisis in 2018.</p><p><strong>RBA kept rates at 0.25% as expected and maintained 3yr yield target at 0.25%, RBA said the board will not raise the cash rate target until the economy meets inflation and employment goals,</strong> while it will maintain efforts in keeping funding costs low and credit available. RBA stated that containment measures have reduced infection rates across countries and if this continues, a recovery in the global economy will start later this year. Furthermore, it sees output falling 10% in H1 and by around 6% for the year before rebounding 6% next year in its baseline scenario but noted that a stronger recovery is possible if there is further substantial progress in containing coronavirus in the near-term.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>No real surprise that the German 10 year benchmark bore the brunt of initial debt disappointment over GCC reservations against the ECB’s PSPP, but the potential wider repercussions for the PEPP and bond buying in general have spread to the Eurozone margins, with<strong>BTPs</strong>&nbsp;under pressure in particular.&nbsp;<strong>Bunds</strong>&nbsp;have subsequently bounced from 173.42 by over 30 ticks as Italian futures flounder below 137.50 vs 139.02 at best, while&nbsp;<strong>Gilts</strong>&nbsp;have resumed their recovery after a minor blip to 137.49 and recently peered a few ticks above parity at 137.77. Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>US&nbsp;Treasuries</strong>&nbsp;remain near overnight session lows and the curve continues to re-steepen amidst heavy corporate issuance and the glut of UST supply to come. More immediately, trade data, final Markit services PMI, ISM non-manufacturing and a couple of Fed speakers all slated.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>Brent</strong>&nbsp;front month futures continue their grinds higher amid optimism of a rebalancing market as oil producers curtail output and economies gradually come back online. Further on the supply side, the Texas Railroad Commission is to convene today at 15:30BST to discuss and vote on mandated oil cuts. Markets largely expected the Commission to vote against the production limit –called “pro-rationing”. Texas is the largest US oil-producing state, with an output of around 5.4mln BPD, accounting for around 41% of the nation’s production. The State of Oklahoma (557k BPD) is expected to discuss quotas on May 11th followed by North Dakota (1.425mln BPD) on May 20th. In terms of bank commentary, UBS expects oil markets to be balanced in Q3 followed by a period of undersupply in Q4. The Swiss bank expects Brent proves to recover to USD 43/bbl by end-2020 but notes that global travel restrictions are likely to keep the market oversupplied in Q2.&nbsp;WTI&nbsp;June resides at the top of its current USD 21.13-22.77/bbl range while&nbsp;Brent&nbsp;July also sees itself at the top-end of its intraday USD 27.77-29.41/bbl band. Later today, eyes will be on the API data for back the storage decline narrative, with extra focus on Cushing. Some traders warn that although the metric may print a smaller build, this does not mean storage capacity is expanding – but rather less room for larger builds. Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>spot&nbsp;gold</strong>&nbsp;is on the backfoot amid the risk-appetite in the market and trades on either side of 1700/oz.&nbsp;<strong>Copper</strong>&nbsp;meanwhile remains underpinned by the risk-tone alongside the prospect of demand spurred by the reopening of global economics.</p><p>Some OPEC+ states are already in pain because of the cuts and are calling for G20 countries outside the alliance to formally commit to production cuts, rather than letting privately owned companies make their own decisions, according to Energy Intel.

Eur/Usd has subsequently slumped towards 1.0800 and support seen around 1.0800, with the DXY eyeing 100.000 given the Euro’s hefty weighting in the index.</p><p>CHF - The Franc has extended declines against the Greenback to sub-0.9700 in wake of downbeat Swiss data and survey releases in the form of CPI and consumer confidence both turning more negative, but Eur/Chf has retreated further towards 1.0500 on the aforementioned Euro depreciation that may also have implications for the PEPP.</p><p>NOK/SEK/AUD/CAD - Relative G10 outperformers, as the Norwegian Crown draws more momentum from oil’s continued recovery and the aforementioned Euro weakness to retest 11.2000, while the Swedish Krona takes some encouragement from preliminary Q1 GDP metrics showing resilience the economy before the anticipated COVID-19 demise, with Eur/Sek hovering just above 10.7000. Elsewhere, the Aussie is holding a portion of its post-RBA gains following unchanged rates, albeit off overnight peaks when stops were tripped beyond 0.6450, and the Loonie is also benefiting from the more pronounced rebound in crude prices within a 1.4030-95 range ahead of Canadian and US trade reports.</p><p>GBP/NZD/JPY - All struggling to contend with Buck’s revival at the expense of the Euro in large part, but Cable has taken comfort from an upward tweak to the UK’s services PMI and Eur/Gbp’s reversal through the 200 DMA to stay afloat between 1.2420-85 parameters. Conversely, the Kiwi is being hampered somewhat by cross-winds given upside in Aud/Nzd from the low 1.0600 area to just shy of 1.0650 after the RBA, but pivoting 0.6050 vs its US counterpart in advance of NZ Q1 labour data tonight. Meanwhile, the Yen remains entrenched in Japanese holiday trade within a 106.50-90 band and waiting for the end of Golden Week that ends just in time for NFP on Friday.</p><p>EM - Little respite for the Lira as attempts to pare losses become less compelling and shallower into the 7.0000 handle, with Usd/Try increasingly more inclined to extend the break and target record peaks not seen since Turkey’s economic, fiscal and currency crisis in 2018.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>No real surprise that the German 10 year benchmark bore the brunt of initial debt disappointment over GCC reservations against the ECB’s PSPP, but the potential wider repercussions for the PEPP and bond buying in general have spread to the Eurozone margins, with <strong>BTPs</strong> under pressure in particular. <strong>Bunds</strong> have subsequently bounced from 173.42 by over 30 ticks as Italian futures flounder below 137.50 vs 139.02 at best, while <strong>Gilts</strong> have resumed their recovery after a minor blip to 137.49 and recently peered a few ticks above parity at 137.77. Elsewhere, <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> remain near overnight session lows and the curve continues to re-steepen amidst heavy corporate issuance and the glut of UST supply to come. More immediately, trade data, final Markit services PMI, ISM non-manufacturing and a couple of Fed speakers all slated.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures continue their grinds higher amid optimism of a rebalancing market as oil producers curtail output and economies gradually come back online. Further on the supply side, the Texas Railroad Commission is to convene today at 15:30BST to discuss and vote on mandated oil cuts. Markets largely expected the Commission to vote against the production limit –called “pro-rationing”. Texas is the largest US oil-producing state, with an output of around 5.4mln BPD, accounting for around 41% of the nation’s production. The State of Oklahoma (557k BPD) is expected to discuss quotas on May 11th followed by North Dakota (1.425mln BPD) on May 20th. In terms of bank commentary, UBS expects oil markets to be balanced in Q3 followed by a period of undersupply in Q4. The Swiss bank expects Brent proves to recover to USD 43/bbl by end-2020 but notes that global travel restrictions are likely to keep the market oversupplied in Q2. <strong>WTI</strong> June resides at the top of its current USD 21.13-22.77/bbl range while <strong>Brent</strong> July also sees itself at the top-end of its intraday USD 27.77-29.41/bbl band. Later today, eyes will be on the API data for back the storage decline narrative, with extra focus on Cushing. Some traders warn that although the metric may print a smaller build, this does not mean storage capacity is expanding – but rather less room for larger builds. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> is on the backfoot amid the risk-appetite in the market and trades on either side of 1700/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile remains underpinned by the risk-tone alongside the prospect of demand spurred by the reopening of global economics.</p>",

However, some of the Bank’s actions are deemed to be illegal and not backed by the EU Treaty, so the Senate has set a 3 month deadline for the GC to clearly define PSPP proportionality in the context of associated economic and fiscal effects, after which time the Bundesbank may not be permitted to participate in the asset purchase scheme, or reinvestment following the transition period. Eur/Usd has subsequently slumped towards 1.0800 and support seen around 1.0800, with the <strong>DXY</strong> eyeing 100.000 given the Euro’s hefty weighting in the index.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc has extended declines against the Greenback to sub-0.9700 in wake of downbeat Swiss data and survey releases in the form of CPI and consumer confidence both turning more negative, but Eur/Chf has retreated further towards 1.0500 on the aforementioned Euro depreciation that may also have implications for the PEPP.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>Relative G10 outperformers, as the Norwegian Crown draws more momentum from oil’s continued recovery and the aforementioned Euro weakness to retest 11.2000, while the Swedish Krona takes some encouragement from preliminary Q1 GDP metrics showing resilience the economy before the anticipated COVID-19 demise, with Eur/Sek hovering just above 10.7000. Elsewhere, the Aussie is holding a portion of its post-RBA gains following unchanged rates, albeit off overnight peaks when stops were tripped beyond 0.6450, and the Loonie is also benefiting from the more pronounced rebound in crude prices within a 1.4030-95 range ahead of Canadian and US trade reports.</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>All struggling to contend with Buck’s revival at the expense of the Euro in large part, but Cable has taken comfort from an upward tweak to the UK’s services PMI and Eur/Gbp’s reversal through the 200 DMA to stay afloat between 1.2420-85 parameters. Conversely, the Kiwi is being hampered somewhat by cross-winds given upside in Aud/Nzd from the low 1.0600 area to just shy of 1.0650 after the RBA, but pivoting 0.6050 vs its US counterpart in advance of NZ Q1 labour data tonight. Meanwhile, the Yen remains entrenched in Japanese holiday trade within a 106.50-90 band and waiting for the end of Golden Week that ends just in time for NFP on Friday.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Little respite for the Lira as attempts to pare losses become less compelling and shallower into the 7.0000 handle, with Usd/Try increasingly more inclined to extend the break and target record peaks not seen since Turkey’s economic, fiscal and currency crisis in 2018.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>CONSENSUS: </strong>Analysts expect the ISM non-manufacturing PMI headline to fall to 36.8 in April (the range of forecasts is wide at 30.0-47.6, indicating a great deal of uncertainty in the estimates) from 52.5 in March. If the consensus is right, the index will drop beneath even the low seen in the Great Financial Crisis (an all-time low of 37.8 in November 2008), and would be the largest single month fall on record. The three key sub-components (business activity, new orders, and employment) are expected to fall, as signalled by the collapse in the March retail sales data.</p><p><strong>QUIRKS: </strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics warns that calendar quirks may flatter the headline in today’s data: “the drop in the headline index likely will be limited by a further increase in the supplier deliveries component, which accounts for a quarter of the headline index and will be pushed up again by the closure of supply chains,” Pantheon writes, noting that it rose by a hefty 9.7 points in March. PM argues that “there is nothing good about the headline index being supported by the delivery times index, which is intended to capture supply constraints at a time of sustained strong demand, usually near the end of the cycle,” and adds that “right now, it just hides the full extent of the damage in the distribution sector.”</p><p><strong>COMPARABLE GAUGES: </strong>Markit’s flash services PMI fell to 27.0 in April, a new low for the series, and the survey compiler noted that the blow of the COVID fallout has been most heavily felt in the service sector, and especially for consumer facing companies. And even those companies that were still actively trading reported the steepest drop in demand seen since data were first available and are also struggling against twin headwinds of staff shortages and supply chain delays. “The scale of the fall in the PMI adds to signs that the second quarter will see an historically dramatic contraction of the economy, and will add to worries about the ultimate cost of the fight against the pandemic.”</p><p><strong>REACTION:</strong> While the numbers are going to be horrific, emphasising the stress the economy is undergoing, Rabobank thinks that given we are approaching an end to lockdown, the shocks of these very weak prints is starting to fade.</p>",

Markets largely expected the Commission to vote against the production limit –called “pro-rationing”. Texas is the largest US oil-producing state, with an output of around 5.4mln BPD, accounting for around 41% of the nation’s production.</p><p><strong>SPLIT: </strong>The RRC comprises Chairman Christian and Commissioners Craddick and Sitton:</p><ul><li><strong>Chairman Christian (AGAINST):</strong> The chairman wrote in the Houston Chronicle last week that he will be voting against pro-rationing.</li><li><strong>Commissioner Craddick (AGAINST)</strong>: Craddick told the San Antonio Business journal yesterday that she intends on voting against the measure.</li><li><strong>Commissioner Sitton (FOR): </strong>The sole member who voiced approval for a measure which he said was necessary to avoid the midstream sector from becoming overwhelmed by the storage scarcity. However, yesterday Commissioner Sitton called the quotas “dead” and said he will drop his proposal to curtail 1mln BPD of State output. Sitton’s full proposal called for a 20% cutback in Texas output alongside a USD 1000/bbl penalty to producers who exceeded the quota.</li></ul><p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>In April, the meeting among producers saw disagreement on whether cuts should be implemented or not, with larger producers mostly arguing for market-driven declines, and smaller players supportive of cuts. Supporters have warned of severe storage shortages and potential record numbers of bankruptcies amid the current market conditions, while also downplaying the effectiveness of the recent OPEC+ deal on rebalancing the market, urging the Commission to do its part. However, on the other side of the coin, there were arguments that the least profitable wells are already being shut, and that any RRC action would not resolve the crude crisis</p><p><strong>NEXT UP:</strong> With mandated Texan output cuts now seemingly dead, the State of Oklahoma (557k BPD) is expected to discuss quotas on May 11th followed by North Dakota (1.425mln BPD) on May 20th.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbblpd_m.htm\">List of US production by states</a></p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>At 09:00BST on May 5th, the German Constitutional Court (GCC) in Karlsruhe will publish its final verdict on the legality of the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). Desks do not believe the programme will be ruled as a violation of the German constitution, but eyes will be on whether the GCC hands out conditions that could limit the PSPP’s efficiency and flexibility (via the Bundesbank’s participation), whilst the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) also risks being dragged in.</p><p>German Eurosceptics have repeatedly asked the GCC to outlaw some of the ECB’s unconventional policy responses. In a hearing late-July 2019, the GCC voiced support to claims that the ECB overstepped its mandate whilst breaching the prohibition of monetary financing. The Court also said the ECB needs to consider the negative side effects of unconventional policy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE RISKS:</strong></p><p>The ECB does not have to follow German law. The hurdles also remain high for the German court to rule against the Central Bank and thus the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - after latter ruled the programme did not infringe EU law in 2018. A simple disagreement will not be sufficient to overrule the ECJ, whilst a head-on collision with the ECB and ECJ could unravel legal issues regarding German vs. EU law.</p><p><strong>POTENTIAL LIMITS AND FALLOUT:</strong></p><p>Potential limits imposed on the PSPP could include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A cap on the total monthly volumes of purchases</li><li>Distribution of purchases consistent with capital keys</li><li>Issuer and issue limits</li><li>Eligibility criteria based on credit ratings</li></ol><p>An imposition of limits could mean the ECB pays less attention to PSPP and more so on the PEPP, thus opening the door for a new court case against the ECB’s Pandemic Programme – which has fewer “strings” attached and hence could prove more vulnerable in court, albeit a final decision is not expected to be made before end-2021, after the PEPP expires at the end of 2020 (assuming no extension).</p><p>Rulings against these programmes would mean: 1) The Bundesbank will be put in a position where it is legally required to follow the ECB and at the same time adhere to the German Constitutional Court ruling, 2) The ECB will not be able to ignore the ruling of the highest court in the largest member state.</p><p>Desks note that the wording of the GCC ruling will be crucial to understand the ECB room for manoeuvre.</p>",

This follows reports that a leading IHME model projected the US coronavirus death toll could surge to over 134k from a prior forecast of around 72k with the spike attributed to relaxed social distancing and increased mobility, although the White House have downplayed the accuracy of the projection. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> benefitted from the <strong>USD</strong> weakness to break above 1.2450 and <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> bounced off support at 1.0900 but with upside limited ahead of the German Constitutional Court ruling on the legality of ECB's QE programme. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses failed to take advantage of the improved risk tone amid the absence of Japanese participants and recent state of emergency extension, while antipodeans coat-tailed on the risk appetite and gains in oil prices but then slightly stalled after the RBA kept rates unchanged as expected and noted it will not hike rates until the economy meets inflation and employment goals, while it will maintain efforts in keeping funding costs low and projected a 10% decline of output in H1.</p><p><strong>RBA kept rates at 0.25% as expected and maintained 3yr yield target at 0.25%, RBA said the board will not raise the cash rate target until the economy meets inflation and employment goals,</strong> while it will maintain efforts in keeping funding costs low and credit available. RBA stated that containment measures have reduced infection rates across countries and if this continues, a recovery in the global economy will start later this year. Furthermore, it sees output falling 10% in H1 and by around 6% for the year before rebounding 6% next year in its baseline scenario but noted that a stronger recovery is possible if there is further substantial progress in containing coronavirus in the near-term.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were kept rangebound around the USD 1700/oz level by the lack of safe haven demand, while copper prices notched marginals gains overnight due to the improved sentiment.</p><p>Some OPEC+ states are already in pain because of the cuts and are calling for G20 countries outside the alliance to formally commit to production cuts, rather than letting privately owned companies make their own decisions, according to Energy Intel.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX lacked direction to start the week, similar to how it ended last week. On the one hand, a risk off tone overnight had seen the curve bull-flatten, although later in the session the long-end reversed course. Another slew of corporate issuance post-earnings likely influenced the move, including USD 8.5bln from Apple (AAPL), as well as some other large cap names such as Amgen, Altria and Starbucks – Boeing’s (BA) YTD record raise of USD 25bln was only recently digested too. Furthermore, the US Treasury refunding announcement is due on Wednesday where the Treasury will explain how it intends to fund its ballooning deficits as the economy comes to a halt – the prospect of a sovereign supply ramp up is likely keeping some duration bulls on the sidelines. Meanwhile, front-end yields didn’t reverse course like the belly/long-end, accompanied by what one desk notes as what appears to be a growing of cash relative to available collateral in the system, with all three of today’s T-Bill auctions stopping through the screws and seeing higher than average bid-to-cover ratios. Meanwhile, the US Treasury expects to borrow a record USD 2.999trln in net marketable debt in Q2 (April-June), USD 3.055trln more than it estimated in February. US T-note futures (M0) settle 3 ticks higher at 138-31.</p><p>US House Minority Leader Hoyer said that the house is not expected to be in session this week and that there is not timetable yet for a return to Washington.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets trade positive as the region takes impetus from the rebound on Wall St where all major indices spent the session gradually paring the early jitters from the renewed US-China trade tensions and geopolitical concerns in the Korean peninsula, with the upside led by strength in tech and energy. As such, ASX 200 (+0.9%) is higher with the energy names mirroring the outperformance of the sector stateside on continued gains in oil prices and with strength seen across all of the big 4 banks, while Afterpay Touch extends on its rally after Tencent recently became a substantial shareholder in the Co. Hang Seng (+0.3%) is also underpinned by the improved risk tone and following comments from Chief Executive Lam who stated the time has come to ease social distancing measures and that she will announce the easing of restrictions as soon as possible. However, gains are limited after GDP data showed Hong Kong fell deeper into recession with the largest contraction on record for Q1 and as mainland China remained shut, alongside holiday closures in Japan and South Korea.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is softer and trades below the 99.50 level amid a lack of safe haven demand but with price action relatively light amid the holiday-quietened conditions and mixed coronavirus-related signals. This follows reports that a leading IHME model projected the US coronavirus death toll could surge to over 134k from a prior forecast of around 72k with the spike attributed to relaxed social distancing and increased mobility, although the White House have downplayed the accuracy of the projection and the Johns Hopkins tracker pointed to 1015 deaths in the US over the last 24 hours which is the lowest in a month. GBP/USD benefits from the USD weakness to break above 1.2450 and EUR/USD bounced off support at 1.0900 but with upside limited ahead of the German Constitutional Court ruling on the legality of ECB's QE programme. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses failed to benefit from the improved risk tone amid the absence of Japanese participants and recent state of emergency extension, while antipodeans coat-tail on the risk appetite, gains in oil prices and ahead of the RBA rate decision where analysts are unanimous in their forecasts for no change in the Cash Rate Target despite money market rates leaning more towards a 25bps cut.</p>",
