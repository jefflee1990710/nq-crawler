Poloz also stated the bank felt that downside risks to the economy were more than sufficient to outweigh continuing concern about financial vulnerabilities and that the Bank was considering a rate cut even without taking the virus into account. Furthermore, he noted that large scale asset purchases are part of the bank's toolkit but is fortunate not to have had to use them.

Meanwhile, there was a big bid for Treasuries, Gold and Yen, seeing the DX tumble beneath 97. OPEC has reportedly offered a 1.5mln BPD cut, although crude traded lower, likely in part to the perceived reluctance of Russia to come on board with such a cut, despite OPEC commentary. Netflix (NFLX) was one of the few stocks in the green after Piper Jaffray cited its search index data as pointing towards upside to subscriber addition in Q1. Kroger (KR) also traded higher post a decent quarter and giving guidance that doesn’t yet include coronavirus-related benefits as demand for staples rises. COVID-19 continued to weigh on sentiment, with further selling of cruise liners (RCL, CCL, NCLH), airlines (AAL, ALK, UAL) and casinos/hotels (MAR, HLT, WYNN, MGM). Further expectations of dented economic growth, with lower Treasury yields weighed on cyclicals such as Boeing (BA), JPMorgan (JPM) and Dow (DOW). Lower oil prices amid the OPEC+ meeting weighed on the energy sector (XLE, XOP, XOM, MPC). Cypress Semiconductor (CY) had a late session puke lower on reports its Infineon deal could face hurdles due to national security concerns. Liberty Global (LBTYK) was under the spotlight following reports its UK-based Virgin Media had its 900k user database accessed by a third party. SPX -3.36% at 3025, NDX -3.10% at 8672, DJ -3.58% at 26122.</p><p>The TPLEX caught another bid on Thursday, this time indiscriminately across the curve, as opposed to the steepener on Wednesday. The move comes amid a decline in risk sentiment after the bounce higher on Wednesday, exacerbating the haven flows and pronouncing the decline in growth expectations. Looking at STIRs, one market source contacted the desk noting that rates desks had been bidding some chunky sized puts in the Euribor and Short Sterling white strips, which one trader believes is likely a result of the Libors pricing in rate cuts at a slower pace than the Sonias/Eonias/OISs are in the o/n markets, leading to basis widening, that if/when central banks cut further, will tighten again. Meanwhile, some draw attention to potential dollar funding pressures amid the virus shock which could be leading desks to hedge against their collateral to avoid potential for pricey dollars, this time via puts in STIRs. Further down the Treasury curve, the term structure had flattened marginally by settlement, with the 2s10s -1bps, with the 10-year yield down 7bps to 0.922%, close to its record low of 0.899 which it printed earlier in the session. US T-note futures (H0) settled 16+ ticks higher at 136-24+.</p>",

Events and Speakers: Fed’s Williams, Kashkari, Evans, Bullard and George.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Stocks reversed Wednesday’s gains as virus concerns took hold of the narrative somewhat from the alleviation of a potential socialist President, additionally, the virus uncertainty puts markets in a tricky situation where participants struggle to hold conviction on the impact on the global economy and how sustained it would be, which large moves in risk assets, in either direction on a day-by-day basis, is reflective of. Meanwhile, there was a big bid for Treasuries, Gold and Yen, seeing the DX tumble beneath 97. OPEC has reportedly offered a 1.5mln BPD cut, although crude traded lower, likely in part to the perceived reluctance of Russia to come on board with such a cut, despite OPEC commentary. Looking ahead, participants will be focusing on the NFP report on Friday, although could be considered somewhat stale due to expectations for the employment market to now begin feeling some strain from the virus, which will not be as evident in the February report.</p><p><strong>* NFP PREVIEW: </strong>After a couple of strongly above-trend readings within the last three reports, the trend of payroll growth has seen shorter term averages rise above longerterm averages, indicating momentum in the pace of hiring: the 3-month average is now 211k (from 198k), 6-month now at 206k (from 200k), and 12- month now at 171k (from 175k). However, the street looks for a print of 178k in February. <i>Click </i><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24019/download\"><i>here</i></a><i> for the full preview.</i></p><p><strong>* COVID-19 UPDATE: </strong>The CDC reported 100 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COID-19 with one more death, leaving the total at 10. Despite a relatively low amount of reported US cases and a perceived high death rate, due to the lack of immediate testing/diagnosis kits available - something which VP Pence recognised as a supply issue - it is likely that there are many more cases which go unreported and that cases which are identified tend to be those with more severity and thus deaths appear more common. Meanwhile in the UK, the government line is that the country is beyond the containment phase and will now have to work to “delay” the spreading of the virus – although PM Johnson has said, for now, business as usual and to KEEP WASHING HANDS. Meanwhile, cases continue to rise in Western Europe as countries begin preparing for their respective epidemics. The big question mark for markets continues to be how sustained, and widespread, the economic shock will be, and as of such the shape</p><p><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Fell to 216k from to 219k, slightly higher than the expected 215k, bringing the 4-week average up to 213k from 210k; continued claims rose to 1.729mln (exp. 1.733mln) from a downwardly revised 1.722mln. Pantheon Economics notes that it expected a slightly lower reading, citing seasonals, but notes the noisiness of the data and more broadly, as a share of the workforce, claims have never been lower. Looking ahead, the consultancy says that recent stability should make it clear to identify any volatility due to the coronavirus, “we are braced for an upshift in the next couple of months.”</p><p><strong>* JOB CUTS: </strong>Challenger job cuts improved in February (-16% M/M, -4% Y/Y) where 56,660 employees were laid off, down from the 67,735 in January, boding well for the NFP report. The breakdown was led by tech jobs, retail and transportation, although none of which cited the coronavirus as a reason. Challenger states “Despite widespread concerns about COVID-19, it has yet to impact job cut announcements. This may change if the supply side remains dormant, as companies grapple with whether to keep operations open without product. It could also impact Retail, Hospitality, and Travel companies, if concerns keep people at home”, adding measures are being taken by companies such as limited travel, and to work from home if technology allows them to do so. On the coronavirus, Challenger stated “While the majority of cases worldwide have been mild and many people who contract it may not even require a hospital stay, that is not the case for high-risk populations.”</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 0.88 LOWER AT USD 45.90/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 1.14 LOWER AT USD 49.99/BBL: </strong>Energy markets traded lower<strong> </strong>on Thursday after the first day of the OPEC+ meeting, where Russia remains the “wild card”. However, the group is said to have committed to a 1.5mln BPD additional cut, out to year-end, provided Russia comes onboard. The cut is reported to be divided by 1mln of additional cuts from the core OPEC group, while OPEC+ members (including Russia) are expected to pick up the additional 500k BPD of cuts. Friday’s conclusion should, or should not, bare the fruit energy markets are so urgently needing, particularly in the face of falling global economic output amid the coronavirus. IEA Chief Birol spoke later, saying he believes the virus will only be a temporary issue, although did say it is causing a “disproportionately strong” impact. Birol added that the IEA would be cutting its demand outlook in Monday’s monthly report. Energy analysts at Citi note that if Russia fails to come on board with further cuts, then oil prices could come under heavy selling pressure, “we wouldn’t be surprised to see a further USD 3-5 price decline, just on the near term market reaction,” and notes that even with the cut, the market may still not be satisfied on the groups sluggish pace to provide the support. Note that in the later session OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said there is no reason to doubt Russia’s commitment and doesn’t believe otherwise.</p><p><strong>* BOC GOVERNOR POLOZ: </strong>Reiterated the bank is ready to cut rates further if needed to support growth and keep inflation on target, saying lower rates will help stabilize the housing market rather than contribute to froth – later adding that negative rates are considered as part of the toolkit, although are an extreme response, furthermore, that LSAPs are another part, but the Bank is fortunate not to have had to use them. The Bank Governor even said that a rate cut was already serious being considered excluding the virus situation. Poloz warned Canada is heading for another quarter of very weak growth, where Q2 could also take a hit. Talking about the 50bps cut, he said the Bank felt that downside risks to the economy were more than sufficient to outweigh continuing concern about financial vulnerabilities, where there is a real risk that business and consumer confidence will erode further and create a more persistent slowdown. Poloz noted that stresses from lower commodity prices will spread from energy-producing regions into other parts of Canada. On the bright side, he noted that the labour market continues to be a source of resilience for the economy and is in good health overall.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU’s Barnier stated the first round of talks were conducted in a constructive manner, however Barnier noted there are many divergences between the two sides on the future relationship which includes the level playing field, a very familiar disagreement. Elsewhere, problems include Fisheries, ECJ and ECHR and overall governance. Barnier however does believe a good agreement can be reached for both sides despite “very, very difficult” disagreements; EU Trade Chief Hogan stated it is difficult to take comfort from the recent talks. The UK had similar views, noting a constructive tone has characterised the talks, there are a number of differences and that these negotiations will be tough.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 16+ TICKS HIGHER AT 136-24+. </strong>The TPLEX caught another bid on Thursday, this time indiscriminately across the curve, as opposed to the steepener on Wednesday. The move comes amid a decline in risk sentiment after the bounce higher on Wednesday, exacerbating the haven flows and pronouncing the decline in growth expectations. Looking at STIRs, one market source contacted the desk noting that rates desks had been bidding some chunky sized puts in the Euribor and Short Sterling white strips, which one trader believes is likely a result of the Libors pricing in rate cuts at a slower pace than the Sonias/Eonias/OISs are in the o/n markets, leading to basis widening, that if/when central banks cut further, will tighten again. Meanwhile, some draw attention to potential dollar funding pressures amid the virus shock which could be leading desks to hedge against their collateral to avoid potential for pricey dollars, this time via puts in STIRs. Further down the Treasury curve, the term structure had flattened marginally by settlement, with the 2s10s -1bps, with the 10-year yield down 7bps to 0.922%, close to its record low of 0.899 which it printed earlier in the session.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> -3.36</strong>% at 3025,<strong> </strong>NDX -3.10% at 8672, DJ -3.58% at 26122. <strong>Sectors</strong>: Industrials -4.96%, Financials -4.85%, Cons Disc -3.76%, Communication Svs -3.7%, Energy -3.61%, Materials -3.22%, Technology -3.21%, Health -2.39%, Real Estate -2.36%, Cons Stpl -1.98%, Utilities -1.63%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) was one of the few stocks in the green after Piper Jaffray cited its search index data as pointing towards upside to subscriber addition in Q1. Kroger (KR) also traded higher post a decent quarter and giving guidance that doesn’t yet include coronavirus-related benefits as demand for staples rises. COVID-19 continued to weigh on sentiment, with further selling of cruise liners (RCL, CCL, NCLH), airlines (AAL, ALK, UAL) and casinos/hotels (MAR, HLT, WYNN, MGM). Further expectations of dented economic growth, with lower Treasury yieldsyields weighed on cyclicals such as Boeing (BA), JPMorgan (JPM) and Dow (DOW). Lower oil prices amid the OPEC+ meeting weighed on the energy sector (XLE, XOP, XOM, MPC). Cypress Semiconductor (CY) had a late session puke lower on reports its Infineon deal could face hurdles due to national security concerns. Liberty Global (LBTYK) was under the spotlight following reports its UK-based Virgin Media had its 900k user database accessed by a third party.</p><p>* <strong>FX WRAP: USD</strong> was hit today with DXY falling beneath the 97.00 figure as the 10-year yield falls back beneath 1% to print a fresh record low of 0.8990%. Data today had little impact as participants await February's Job's report tomorrow. <strong>GBP</strong>USD largely a dollar story today, meanwhile <strong>EURGBP</strong> trades flat despite a less than pleasing update from EU/UK talks. <strong>EUR</strong> performed well today despite a continued rise in cases, where participants are awaiting any further details on a response to COVID-19, with information so far only from Italy who are proposing a EUR 7.5bln dollar package. EURUSD crossed over 1.12 and EURGBP was supported above 0.8650. <strong>CAD</strong> continued to weaken after its 50bps cut yesterday with governor Poloz highlighting that the bank was looking to cut rates even without the coronavirus as a factor. He also noted negative interest rates and LSAP are a part of its tool kit, although the former only in extreme circumstances, meanwhile a fall in oil prices only adds to the sell off. <strong>AUD</strong> succumbed the broader risk appetite paring back from its post GDP highs. <strong>NZD</strong> however saw a relatively unreactive day throughout the US session and is heading into overnight trade flat against the greenback. <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> both outperforming from the soured risk appetite as the former now trades beneath 106.50, meanwhile gold surged over USD 35 to highs just shy of USD 1675. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker across the board with <strong>BRL</strong> taking its cues from cautious commentary from the Treasury Secretary who noted there are no formal discussions with the BCB about the Real and the 2 entities never intervene in a coordinated fashion. The BCB intervened a number of times today, but only shortly stemmed the decline, before USDBRL traded to record highs of 4.6663. <strong>TRY</strong> failed to find support after President Erdogan and Russia President Putin agreed to a ceasefire in Syria’s Idlib, meanwhile <strong>ZAR</strong> was hit on reports of its first coronavirus case.</p>",

Data today had little impact as participants await February's Job's report tomorrow. <strong>GBP</strong>USD largely a dollar story today, meanwhile <strong>EURGBP</strong> trades flat despite a less than pleasing update from EU/UK talks. <strong>EUR</strong> performed well today despite a continued rise in cases, where participants are awaiting any further details on a response to COVID-19, with information so far only from Italy who are proposing a EUR 7.5bln dollar package. EURUSD crossed over 1.12 and EURGBP was supported above 0.8650. <strong>CAD</strong> continued to weaken after its 50bps cut yesterday with governor Poloz highlighting that the bank was looking to cut rates even without the coronavirus as a factor. He also noted negative interest rates and LSAP are a part of its tool kit, although the former only in extreme circumstances, meanwhile a fall in oil prices only adds to the sell off. <strong>AUD</strong> succumbed the broader risk appetite paring back from its post GDP highs. <strong>NZD</strong> however saw a relatively unreactive day throughout the US session and is heading into overnight trade flat against the greenback. <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> both outperforming from the soured risk appetite as the former now trades beneath 106.50, meanwhile gold surged over USD 35 to highs just shy of USD 1675. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker across the board with <strong>BRL</strong> taking its cues from cautious commentary from the Treasury Secretary who noted there are no formal discussions with the BCB about the Real and the 2 entities never intervene in a coordinated fashion. The BCB intervened a number of times today, but only shortly stemmed the decline, before USDBRL traded to record highs of 4.6663. <strong>TRY</strong> failed to find support after President Erdogan and Russia President Putin agreed to a ceasefire in Syria’s Idlib, meanwhile <strong>ZAR</strong> was hit on reports of its first coronavirus case.</li></ul>",

The move comes amid a decline in risk sentiment after the bounce higher on Wednesday, exacerbating the haven flows and pronouncing the decline in growth expectations. Looking at STIRs, one market source contacted the desk noting that rates desks had been bidding some chunky sized puts in the Euribor and Short Sterling white strips, which one trader believes is likely a result of the Libors pricing in rate cuts at a slower pace than the Sonias/Eonias/OISs are in the o/n markets, leading to basis widening, that if/when central banks cut further, will tighten again. Meanwhile, some draw attention to potential dollar funding pressures amid the virus shock which could be leading desks to hedge against their collateral to avoid potential for pricey dollars, this time via puts in STIRs. Further down the Treasury curve, the term structure had flattened marginally by settlement, with the 2s10s -1bps, with the 10-year yield down 7bps to 0.922%, close to its record low of 0.899 which it printed earlier in the session.</li></ul>",

However, the group is said to have committed to a 1.5mln BPD additional cut, out to year-end, provided Russia comes onboard. The cut is reported to be divided by 1mln of additional cuts from the core OPEC group, while OPEC+ members (including Russia) are expected to pick up the additional 500k BPD of cuts. Friday’s conclusion should, or should not, bare the fruit energy markets are so urgently needing, particularly in the face of falling global economic output amid the coronavirus. IEA Chief Birol spoke later, saying he believes the virus will only be a temporary issue, although did say it is causing a “disproportionately strong” impact. Birol added that the IEA would be cutting its demand outlook in Monday’s monthly report. Energy analysts at Citi note that if Russia fails to come on board with further cuts, then oil prices could come under heavy selling pressure, “we wouldn’t be surprised to see a further USD 3-5 price decline, just on the near term market reaction,” and notes that even with the cut, the market may still not be satisfied on the groups sluggish pace to provide the support. Note that in the later session OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said there is no reason to doubt Russia’s commitment and doesn’t believe otherwise.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>has ducked under Tuesday’s post-Fed rate cut low due to heftier Dollar declines vs safer havens within the major ranks compared to gains made at the expense of riskier counterparts, not to mention EMs. In short, while the numbers out of China catching nCoV and dying from the bug continue to wane the global tally is rising and spreading to the detriment of growth, confidence and sentiment quite apart from the obvious human/social cost. Hence, the risk dial is flashing aversion again and currency markets are broadly trading in that vein with the index hovering near the base of a 97.443-96.886 range ahead of Friday’s US jobs data that might divert attention from COVID-19 watch (at least for a while).</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>The Yen remains ahead of the G10 pack and most desired destination amidst renewed coronavirus concerns, as Usd/Jpy down to circa 106.65 at one stage, while the Franc is inching closer to 0.9500 and Euro touched 1.1200 before topping out again. The single currency is still weighing up ECB policy responses to the deadly epidemic as its grip on Italy and other Euro area nations tightens, but the headline pair may also have been impaired by technical resistance above the big figure given Tuesday’s circa 1.1212 high and a more substantial upside chart hurdle in the form of a peak from last October around 1.1240. Elsewhere, Sterling has witnessed another wild ride on pre-UK Budget, BoE and Brexit considerations on top of general Greenback moves and swings in overall sentiment, with Cable straddling 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp rotating either side of 0.8650, but the Pound not unduly perturbed by a rather mixed summary of UK-EU trade talks round 1 – Barnier highlighting serious divergences such as the level playing field vs UK sources citing constructive and good natured discussions with common ground in certain areas.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All on the back foot, as the Aussie continues its retreat from post-RBA/GDP highs to sub-0.6600 on a combination of disappointing trade internals and Chinese virus contagion, while the Loonie is still licking wounds after Wednesday’s 50 bp BoC rate cut between 1.3432-1.3380 parameters awaiting an OPEC+ decision and Governor Poloz doing the media rounds before delivering the EPR. Conversely, the Kiwi clinging to the 0.6300 handle, albeit by virtue to a degree of a change in the direction of Aud/Nzd cross winds from 1.0500+ to 1.0465 at one stage. Meanwhile, the Scandinavian Crowns were rattled by the aforementioned resumption of risk-off flows/positioning, but Eur/Sek was capped just below 10.6000 following decent Swedish ip data including a rebound in new orders.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A bad day at the office for most regional currencies, and the pain for Zar was compounded by a first case of nCoV that prompted SA Ramaphosa to warn that this could culminate in a nationwide crisis. Similarly, the Brl was already heading towards fresh record lows, but further undermined by comments from Brazil’s Treasury Secretary contending that there are no formal discussions with the BCB about the Real and the 2 entities never intervene in a coordinated fashion.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+2.1%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+2.0%)</strong> conformed to the optimism and eventually outperformed despite early hesitation after the PBoC continued to hold off on liquidity operations and amid a slight increase in the mainland coronavirus cases, while reports also noted local companies and officials were falsely boosting metrics to achieve back-to-work targets. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy and initially slumped following the post-settlement declines in T-notes through 136.00 amid a return of corporate issuers to the market, although JGBs later recouped some of the losses following the break helped by the 30yr JGB auction which attracted higher prices before slipping back again to beneath 154.00.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Unexpected rate reductions by the FOMC and BoC this were welcomed by the market, however, central bank action thus far has done little to assuage concerns over the supply-side impact from the spread of COIVD-19 with the UK’s Chief Medical Officer today warning that there is now community transmission in Britain and officials are now at the stage of trying to delay the virus’ spread rather than contain it. From a sector standpoint, performance is relatively mixed with energy, materials and consumer discretionary names the laggards, whilst consumer staples and health care names are faring slightly better than their peers.

On that note, the BoJ is said to be looking at a new credit facility following the IMF, PBoC and others, while conventional policy stimulus via YCC tweaks and a standard rate cut are bound to be under consideration as well. Usd/Jpy has retreated through 107.00 and now testing Wednesday’s 106.85 overnight low and an October 2019 base close by, while Eur/Jpy is below 119.50 even though the single currency is also trying to extend gains vs the Dollar.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/CHF/EUR - </strong>All firmer against the Greenback, with the Kiwi making a more decisive break of 0.6300, though probably assisted by a degree of Aud/Nzd retracement after mixed Aussie trade data. Meanwhile, Cable has crossed more resistance levels on the way to and through the 1.2900 handle, like the 10 and 21 DMAs, as Eur/Gbp continues to pull back from another 200 DMA peak. However, 1.2950 and 0.8600 may be tough to breach without additional bullish momentum ahead of more BoE commentary and a speech from EU’s Barnier on the first round of trade talks with the UK at noon. Elsewhere, the Franc is firmer around the 0.9550 axis, but Eur/Chf more restrained either side of 1.0650 as the Euro stages another advance on 1.1200 amidst broad Buck weakness in G10 circles and the DXY losing impetus following yesterday’s upbeat US data/survey releases – index fading ahead of 97.500 and now only just holding above 97.000.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The crude complex was modestly in negative territory for much of the session however recent source reports out of OPEC have bolstered <strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front month futures substantially, although this has since begun to pair back. The report noted that OPEC have agreed to a 1.5mln BPD cut, which would be above the 1.0-1.2mln sought by Saudi but in-line with some reports yesterday. However, and likely the reason for the pairing in price action, this OPEC agreement is subject to approval from Russia who so-far has not offered much indication of their view. Now perhaps more so than any other point in the week participants remains focused on Russia’s stance, but the likelihood of seeing an update to this today has perhaps been diminished by reports that Energy Minister Novak has returned to Russia; albeit, he will be returning for the OPEC+ meeting tomorrow. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> has been grinding higher throughout the session after trading relatively range-bound overnight. The yellow metal is currently posting gains in proximity to USD 10/oz, but is still a way off recent multi-year highs at USD 1689.29/oz.

On that note, the BoJ is said to be looking at a new credit facility following the IMF, PBoC and others, while conventional policy stimulus via YCC tweaks and a standard rate cut are bound to be under consideration as well. Usd/Jpy has retreated through 107.00 and now testing Wednesday’s 106.85 overnight low and an October 2019 base close by, while Eur/Jpy is below 119.50 even though the single currency is also trying to extend gains vs the Dollar.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All firmer against the Greenback, with the Kiwi making a more decisive break of 0.6300, though probably assisted by a degree of Aud/Nzd retracement after mixed Aussie trade data. Meanwhile, Cable has crossed more resistance levels on the way to and through the 1.2900 handle, like the 10 and 21 DMAs, as Eur/Gbp continues to pull back from another 200 DMA peak. However, 1.2950 and 0.8600 may be tough to breach without additional bullish momentum ahead of more BoE commentary and a speech from EU’s Barnier on the first round of trade talks with the UK at noon. Elsewhere, the Franc is firmer around the 0.9550 axis, but Eur/Chf more restrained either side of 1.0650 as the Euro stages another advance on 1.1200 amidst broad Buck weakness in G10 circles and the <strong>DXY</strong> losing impetus following yesterday’s upbeat US data/survey releases – index fading ahead of 97.500 and now only just holding above 97.000. Note, however, decent option expiry interest may hamper Eur/Usd between 1.1175-80 (1 bn).</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>As noted above, Aud/Usd is lagging somewhat within a 0.6637-07 range in wake of trade data showing weaker than forecast exports and imports under the wider than expected surplus, while Usd/Cad remains above 1.3400 following the BoC’s 50 bp ease and ahead of Governor Poloz presenting the EPR later today.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The aforementioned deterioration in sentiment has derailed recoveries in regional currencies to the extent that the Rand has not been able to reap much reward from a modest improvement in SA business morale or a significantly narrower than anticipated current account deficit.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Although the FTSE is fading fairly fast amidst relative Pound strength in the FX markets, Gilts and Short Sterling have made deeper concessions for less angst over the nCoV outbreak (at present), and the 3 month strip is also unwinding more BoE stimulus premium after remarks from various MPC members along with incoming Governor Bailey stressing that any policy moves will not be made in haste. Indeed, if the BoE decides to act ahead of schedule it won’t be before the Budget unless the coronavirus situation escalates and deteriorates materially in the meantime. Looking at Liffe price action thus far, the 10 year debt future resumed trade at 135.90 before extending to 135.81, but has subsequently been paring losses alongside Bunds (to 174.93) and US Treasuries (135-31 vs 135-12+ at one stage) and closed the opening gap before fading again. However, STIR contracts remain depressed, at the front end especially, between 1 and 5 ticks below par, albeit just off worst levels. Ahead, 2028 linker supply and more from the BoE via Haldane and Carney, but perhaps all overshadowed by EU’s Barnier with an update on Brexit trade talks.</p>",

However, risk aversion related to the ongoing spread of China’s coronavirus has abated with the aid of more monetary and fiscal support to supplement the practical and medical containment/remedial efforts already underway to alter the overall mood and dampen demand for safe havens in favour of risk assets. Hence, selling into upticks rather than buying dips for core bonds is currently in play pending another twist in the COVID-19 plot.</p>",

There were initial reports yesterday that OPEC+ will agree to a 1mln bpd cut and were even said to be discussing an option of 1.5mln bpd, although the ministerial panel failed to reach an agreement with Russia said to be reluctant for deeper cuts.

Desks noted a slew of real money/CTAs engaging in steepeners on Wednesday, finding some momentum on the back of a strong ADP employment report (183k vs. exp. 170k) and ISM Non-Mfg. (57.3 vs. exp. 54.9), in addition to a pickup in appetite for equities. Meanwhile, as more corporate IG issuers return to the dollar market, the belly- to long-end was under additional pressure as issuance played catch up following the two-week dry spell. Although one desk noted a particular asset manager who was keeping a lid on the steepening, selling a total of 34,452 TUs (2s) while buying 11,175 TNs (10s). The overhanging virus and potential QE is likely providing some support further out the curve. By settlement, 10-year yield had risen back to 1.00%, whilst the whole curve had steepened with the 2-year yield down 8bps and the 30-year yield unchanged on the day.

Manufacturing activity expanded in most of the US although some supply chain delays due to the virus were reported and producers feared further disruption, while consumer spending generally picked up although growth was uneven across the US.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac indices rose across the board following the constructive pick up from Wall St where all major indices surged and the DJIA posted gains of almost 1200 points after Joe Biden’s Super Tuesday victory and with sentiment also underpinned by US data, as well as further response measures including the BoC’s 50bps rate cut and IMF’s USD 50bln aid package. ASX 200 (+1.1%) was underpinned by hopes of looming stimulus which Australian Finance Minister Cormann reiterated will be announced very soon and as healthcare tracked the outperformance of the sector stateside which was boosted after Biden overtook ’Medicare for All’ advocate Sanders as favourite in the Democrat nomination race, while TPG Telecom was the biggest gaining stock post-earnings and after the ACCC declared it will not appeal the decision to allow the Co.’s merger with Vodafone. Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) also benefitted from notable strength in pharmaceuticals including Takeda which is developing a coronavirus drug and completed the sale of certain OTC and non-core assets, although further upside in the broader market was capped by an indecisive currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) conformed to the optimism and eventually outperformed despite early hesitation after the PBoC continued to hold off on liquidity operations and amid a slight increase in the mainland coronavirus cases, while reports also noted local companies and officials were falsely boosting metrics to achieve back-to-work targets. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy and initially slumped following the post-settlement declines in T-notes through 136.00 amid a return of corporate issuers to the market, although JGBs later recouped some of the losses following the break helped by the 30yr JGB auction which attracted higher prices before slipping back again to beneath 154.00.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac indices are higher across the board following the constructive pick up from Wall St where all major indices surged and the DJIA posted gains of almost 1200 points after Joe Biden’s Super Tuesday victory and with sentiment also underpinned by strong US data, as well as further response measures including the BoC’s 50bps rate cut and IMF’s USD 50bln aid package. ASX 200 (+0.9%) is underpinned by hopes of looming stimulus which Australian Finance Minister Cormann reiterated will be announced very soon and as healthcare tracks the outperformance of the sector stateside which was boosted after Biden overtook ’Medicare for All’ advocate Sanders as favourite in the Democrat nomination race, while TPG Telecom is the biggest gaining stock post-earnings and after the ACCC declared it will not appeal the decision to allow the Co.’s merger with Vodafone. Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) also benefits from notable strength in pharmaceuticals including Takeda which is developing a coronavirus drug and completed the sale of certain OTC and non-core assets, although gains in the broader market have been capped by some detrimental currency flows. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (1.2%) eventually outperformed despite early hesitation after the PBoC continued to hold off on liquidity operations and slight increase in the mainland coronavirus cases, while reports also noted local companies and officials were falsely boosting metrics to reach back-to-work targets.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY trades steady after having mildly benefitted from strong data including ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and better than expected ADP Employment numbers ahead of Friday’s NFP release. There were also comments from Fed’s Bullard who seemingly leaned away from an immediate further reduction in rates as he noted that a barrier to cutting again this month is that action has just been taken and they would need data to justify another cut, while he noted there will not be much new information on hand at the March meeting but added that Fed has plenty of flexibility and shown it can act between meetings in volatile situations. The greenback’s major counterparts are uneventful with EUR/USD languishing just below 1.1150 and GBP/USD plateaued at the prior day’s highs after having recently springboarded off 1.2800 to take out a cluster of hourly moving average levels before stalling at the 200-Hour MA at 1.2875. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy as it trades back and forth of 107.50 and antipodeans are also indecisive after mixed Australian trade data and after the PBoC set a firmer reference rate albeit not as firm as what was anticipated.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower following the post-settlement declines in T-notes through 136.00 amid a return of corporate issuers to the market, while demand for JGBs were also kept subdued as participants await a 30yr JGB auction later.</p>",
