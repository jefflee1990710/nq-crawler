        "content": "<ul><li><strong>SNAPSHOT: </strong>US stock and bond futures are flat, with cash markets closed for Martin Luther King Day. There was a quiet feel to trade. The USD had a slight upward bias; the DXY breached its 200dma at 97.72 to the upside but found the air above that level a little thin, though still remains slightly higher on the day. Crude markets are higher on geopolitics in Libya, although are off highs.</li><li><strong>LIBYA/OIL: </strong>News flow has been thin, though crude markets have seen some action at the start of the week on geopolitics, with Libya’s NOC declaring a force-majeure over the weekend at Sharara (300k BPD) and El Feel (70k BPD), following the LNA blocking ports in the Eastern region; the blockade would result in oil exports decreasing by 700k BPD and production by 800k BPD, and the NOC has warned that if the blockades continued then Libyan oil output could fall to just 72k BPD over the next few days from 1.2mln BPD (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-oil-output-stalls-on-middle-east-supply-disruptions-20-01-2020\">full analysis here</a>). Brent prices hit highs around USD 66/bbl. Crude markets have pared gains, with analysts noting that as things stand, the market remains well supplied, and there is a decent margin of spare capacity.</li><li><strong>LOOKING AHEAD – CENTRAL BANKS, DATA, DAVOS:</strong> Now that geopolitical risks relating to Iran have abated, Brexit is going to happen, and the Fed seems comfortable with its current course, traders will focus on fundamental forces this week, namely central bank activity and corporate earnings. The BOJ will get the week’s major central bank activity underway overnight, ahead the BOC on Wednesday, and the ECB/Norges Bank on Thursday; next week, Brexit watchers will be watching the BOE, where a cut is priced with 70% certainty by money markets; this week’s PMIs and Labour market data will be key in shaping expectations. In terms of data, Tuesday will feature German ZEW and UK labour market data, Wednesday sees Canadian CPI, US existing home sales and Aussie employment (ahead of Q4 CPI next week); Kiwi CPI on Thursday, and on Friday, PMIs are on the slate, ahead of Canadian retail sales data to round off the week.</li><li><strong>LOOKING AHEAD – EARNINGS: </strong>Additionally, focus will be on corporate earnings (NFLX, ASML, ABT, PG, INTC, AXP are all due this week – weekly earnings calendar can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23659/download\">here</a>, and Tuesday’s earnings calendar can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23667/download\">here</a>); analysts will be looking at capex and reiterations/upgrades to guidance in order to reinforce the bull case for US equities and justify the multiple expansion seen in 2019 – jitters on this front could provide equities with some headwinds, analysts believe.</li><li><strong>COMING UP OVERNIGHT – BOJ:</strong> BoJ is widely anticipated to maintain current monetary policy settings (rates, QQE and YCC); it is also expected to reiterate forward guidance that rates will remain at current or lower levels for as long as needed. The latest Outlook Report could include upward revisions to board members’ Real GDP growth forecasts. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-oil-output-stalls-on-middle-east-supply-disruptions-20-01-2020\">Full preview here</a>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>CHF/AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p><p>The Aussie, Kiwi and Franc are now propping up the major league, with Usd/Chf edging closer to 0.9700 in somewhat belated fashion after increases in Swiss sight deposits, and Eur/Chf following suit towards the upper end of a 1.0733-50 range. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd remains heavy under the 0.6900 handle, but Aud/Nzd has pared some overnight losses within a 1.0408-1.0382 range as the Kiwi tests bids/support at 0.6600 in the run up to a big Thursday down under given Aussie jobs data and PMIs ahead of NZ Q4 CPI. &nbsp;</p><p>GBP/CAD/JPY/EUR &nbsp;</p><p>The Pound appears to have survived a severe test of recent lows (1.2955 from last Tuesday vs Dollar), but could yet come a cropper if Tuesday’s UK jobs data and/or Friday’s preliminary PMIs continue the recent trend of sub-forecast releases. Meanwhile, the Loonie is nudging the base of a 1.3072-53 band awaiting Canadian manufacturing sales tomorrow and not really deriving any impetus from the latest geopolitically fired rise in crude. The Yen remains below 110.00 and still inversely correlated to Yuan moves, as Usd/Cnh holds comfortably above 6.9000 after another fall in the PBoC’s Usd/Cny midpoint fix. However, Usd/Jpy and Jpy crosses could get some independent direction from the conclusion of January’s BoJ policy meeting &nbsp;- see our Research Suite for a detailed preview. Elsewhere, the Euro appears vulnerable just above 1.1080 amidst reports of 2-way flows and through the January 10/US payroll low (1.1085), but may derive some traction from 1.5 bn option expiries residing between 1.1100-05 into the NY cut. &nbsp;</p><p>USD &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The DXY is off best levels in a 97.575-732 range, but remains underpinned and the index will stay technically strong/bullish on a closing basis if it holds above 97.620 (38.2% Fib retracement), albeit in thinner volumes than usual due to the MLK day market holiday. &nbsp;</p><p>SEK/NOK &nbsp;</p><p>Very little deviation in the Scandi Crowns against the Euro, with Eur/Nok meandering around 9.8800 amidst the aforementioned rebound in oil prices and not overly concerned about a marked deterioration in Norwegian industrial confidence even though it could feed into Norges Bank policy deliberations on Thursday. Note, nearly 900 mn expiries at 9.9000 could be capping the pair. &nbsp;</p><p>EM &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most regional currencies are underperforming vs the Dollar, but Lira, Rand and Real depreciation stand out for well known and persistent reasons, like the high cost of imported fuel, issues with SA Government fiscal support for SAA and Eskom and with Brazilian Economy Minister Guedes effectively giving bears a green light as he conceded that a weak Brl and low interest rates are the new norm. Usd/Try is close to 5.9200, Usd/Zar near 14.5100 and Usd/Brl just above 4.1800. &nbsp;</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>A cautious start to the week for European stocks [Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%] with bourses in the region mostly lower, diverging from the mostly positive APAC performance and with volumes light on account of Martin Luther King Jr. market holiday. European sectors are experiencing broad-based losses with no clear standouts. Energy names failed to reap benefits from the overnight rise in oil prices following the Libyan supply disruption. In terms of individual movers – Airbus (+0.2%) shares are buoyed by reports of glitches during Boeing’s 737 Max tests, with other reports noting that the troubleshooting timeframe is unclear. Furthermore, Airbus is developing a derivatives-based trading platform, dubbed Skytra, designed to hedge the air travel’s exposure to volatile ticket prices, which Citi said to be interested in the venture. Meanwhile, BAE Systems (+2.3%) rose amid strategic acquisitions in which it will purchase Collins Aerospace Military GPS business for USD 1.925bln in cash, alongside another agreement to purchase Raytheon’s radio business for USD 275mln in cash. Both agreements are contingent on the successful closure of Raytheon and United Technologies Corp’s merger. Telefonica (+1.2%) are supported by source reports that the Co. is said to have been offered EUR 10bln for its LatAm business. On the flip slide, Enel (-1.7%) and Snam (-1.7%) rest towards to the foot of the Stoxx 600, albeit more on the back of ex-divs as opposed to individual stories. Lufthansa (-1.7%) shares are also pressured after the German cabin crew union UFO said it is mulling further strikes to increase pressure on management. The union stated that it will announce details on Wednesday 22nd at 1300GMT. Finally, Fevertree (-21%) shares fell amid a profit warning in which it also noted that implementing initiatives is expected to result in a one-off impact on net revenue growth in 2020.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar has resumed its post-US data advance after a shallow pull-back, and with added impetus in lacklustre MLK holiday trade coming from weakness in rival currencies, like the Pound and Rand in particular. The DXY bounced from 97.575 and beyond last week’s peak to test the 200 DMA (97.720) after breaching a key Fib retracement level (97.620), but faded ahead of the next key/significant upside chart hurdles before 98.000, such as December highs at 98.817 and 97.844.</p><p>GBP - In stark contrast to the Greenback, Sterling bears are back in the driving seat as Cable teeters just above last week’s sub-1.3000 lows and Eur/Gbp hovers around 0.8550 even though the Euro has seen some knock-on selling vs the Buck. BoE easing prospects have been bolstered by recent dovish rhetoric from the MPC and relatively bleak domestic data, while reports about Brexit and FTA divisions between the UK and EU are stoking concerns that will only add to rate cut speculation and short positioning in the Pound.</p><p>EUR - As noted above, Eur/Usd has been dragged down alongside Cable and deeper below the 1.1100 handle to probe under earlier January lows (1.1085 on NFP day), but stops have not been tripped in size perhaps due to the aforementioned US market holiday or the draw of hefty option expiry interest between the big figure and 1.1105 (1.5 bn).</p><p>NZD/CAD/JPY/AUD/CHF - All fractionally softer vs the Buck, as the Kiwi clings to 0.6600 by virtue of supportive Aud/Nzd cross flows through 1.0400 and the Aussie’s inability to maintain 0.6900+ status ahead of jobs data and Q4 CPI respectively on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Loonie remains rangy within 1.3055-71 parameters eyeing Canadian manufacturing sales tomorrow, the Yen is meandering from 110.05 to 110.21 awaiting the BoJ policy announcement and accompanying statement overnight and Franc is flitting either side of 0.9683, but firmer against the Euro over 1.0750 despite another rise in weekly Swiss sight deposits.</p><p>EM - Broad declines vs the Usd, but more prominent for the Zar and Try amidst ongoing SAA debt financing issues (failed to make a 2 bn payment over the weekend) and another supply-related spike in oil prices (due to Libyan and Iraqi production disruptions) that have pushed the Rand down through 14.5000 and Lira towards 5.9100.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bunds remain just off worst levels in muted trade (turnover less than 105k lots), but the just released Buba monthly bulletin may prompt a bit more interest and volume on a day bereft of US involvement. Meanwhile, UK bonds have unwound more of their early Liffe advances and recently retreated into negative territory at 133.33 (-12 ticks vs +28 ticks at best) on a lack of follow-through buying rather than anything more fundamental it seems. However, the Eurozone semi-core and periphery are still perky and some participants are pointing to spread plays vs PGBs after Moody’s failed to publish its latest review of Portugal’s rating last Friday and the EC deemed that the country’s deficit could exceed the ceiling. Elsewhere, US Treasury futures are marginally firmer with the curve fractionally flatter ahead of the IMF’s WEO.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> Futures have waned off overnight highs in which front-month futures rose in excess of 1% after Libya’s NOC declared a force-majeure over the weekend, following the LNA blocking ports in the Eastern region. In terms of the impact: the blockade would result in oil exports decreasing by 700k BPD and production by 800k BPD. If the blockades continue then the NOC have warned that Libya’s oil output could be cut to 72k BPD from 1.2mln BPD over the next few days, as only one port will remain open - <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-oil-output-stalls-on-middle-east-supply-disruptions-20-01-2020\">Link to analysis</a>. Brent futures hit a high of USD 66/bbl but has since shed its overnight gains – with Mar’20 futures meandering just above the 65/bbl mark at the time of writing. If the 65/bbl level is breached to the downside, technicians may be eyeing 64.64/bbl (50 WMA) for potential support. In terms of bank outlooks on energy, BOFA has upgraded its 2020 average forecasts for Brent to USD 62/bbl (Prev. USD 60/bbl) and WTI to USD 57/bbl (Prev. USD 54/bbl) -&nbsp; adding that supply and demand forecasts suggest a 190k BPD surplus in 2020 and the bank expects global oil demand growth of 1.1mln BPD (Prev. 1mln BPD) in 2020. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> remains steady as eyes are set on Davos, with opening statements today and European Commission President von der Leyen the only pertinent speaker of the day. The yellow metal stays north of 1550/oz despite the firmer Buck as prices remain supported by Middle East angst. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain little changed but holds onto a bulk of its recent gains amid thin volumes and tailwinds from last week’s Chinese GDP and IP data. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> ore closed with gains amid supply concerns (as imported iron or stocks at China’s ports fell) and improved steel demand outlook heading into the week-long Lunar New Year.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has resumed its post-US data advance after a shallow pull-back, and with added impetus in lacklustre MLK holiday trade coming from weakness in rival currencies, like the Pound and Rand in particular. The DXY bounced from 97.575 and beyond last week’s peak to test the 200 DMA (97.720) after breaching a key Fib retracement level (97.620), but faded ahead of the next key/significant upside chart hurdles before 98.000, such as December highs at 98.817 and 97.844.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to the Greenback, Sterling bears are back in the driving seat as Cable teeters just above last week’s sub-1.3000 lows and Eur/Gbp hovers around 0.8550 even though the Euro has seen some knock-on selling vs the Buck. BoE easing prospects have been bolstered by recent dovish rhetoric from the MPC and relatively bleak domestic data, while reports about Brexit and FTA divisions between the UK and EU are stoking concerns that will only add to rate cut speculation and short positioning in the Pound.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, Eur/Usd has been dragged down alongside Cable and deeper below the 1.1100 handle to probe under earlier January lows (1.1085 on NFP day), but stops have not been tripped in size perhaps due to the aforementioned US market holiday or the draw of hefty option expiry interest between the big figure and 1.1105 (1.5 bn).</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/JPY/AUD/CHF</strong></p><p>All fractionally softer vs the Buck, as the Kiwi clings to 0.6600 by virtue of supportive Aud/Nzd cross flows through 1.0400 and the Aussie’s inability to maintain 0.6900+ status ahead of jobs data and Q4 CPI respectively on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Loonie remains rangy within 1.3055-71 parameters eyeing Canadian manufacturing sales tomorrow, the Yen is meandering from 110.05 to 110.21 awaiting the BoJ policy announcement and accompanying statement overnight and Franc is flitting either side of 0.9683, but firmer against the Euro over 1.0750 despite another rise in weekly Swiss sight deposits.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad declines vs the Usd, but more prominent for the Zar and Try amidst ongoing SAA debt financing issues (failed to make a 2 bn payment over the weekend) and another supply-related spike in oil prices (due to Libyan and Iraqi production disruptions) that have pushed the Rand down through 14.5000 and Lira towards 5.9100.</p>",

In terms of the impact: the blockade would result in oil exports decreasing by 700k BPD and production by 800k BPD. If the blockades continue then the NOC have warned that Libya’s oil output could be cut to 72k BPD from 1.2mln BPD over the next few days, as only one port will remain open.</li><li>These disruptions began as LNA’s Haftar blocked the export ports which he has control over in Libya, prompting the force-majeure. Additionally, Haftar ordered the closure of the Hamada-Zawiya pipeline which is used for both the El Sharara and El Feel oil fields; for reference, El Sharara’s production is typically around 300k BPD with El Feel’s at around 70k BPD.</li><li>This follows on from weekend discussions in Berlin where, according to Politico, a number of countries have agreed to a document calling for the return towards the politico process as well as refraining from military intervention in the region; countries including Russia and Turkey. Talks around this are expected to continue over the next few days.</li><li>In terms of the longer term impact, ING highlight that this level of disruption would be enough to move the oil market from a surplus to a deficit in Q1 and then to balance in Q2; which could have ramifications for the OPEC production cuts which are due to be discussed at the next meeting in March.</li></ul><p>As a reminder, support in the region can broadly be outlined as follows:</p><ul><li>Haftar: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE support, Russian mercenaries &amp; France</li><li>GNA (Libyan Government): Turkey &amp; Italy</li><li>For reference, the US currently hold a neutral stance regarding the Libyan conflict</li></ul><p><strong>Iraq</strong></p><ul><li>Iraq temporarily stopped production at the Al Ahdab, 70k BPD, oil field following on from security guards preventing access to the field demanding permanent employment contracts. Additional reports note that the Badra, 50k BPD, field was at risk of being closed over the weekend; circa 150k BPD production.</li></ul><p><strong>Reaction</strong></p><ul><li>WTI and Brent futures are firmer this morning and did spike to an overnight high of USD 59.77/bbl and USD 66.0/bbl; with gains of around USD 0.50/bbl at present. While the above news did prompt a significant jump in oil prices, it is nowhere near the scale of the moves seen around the Iranian tensions in the first week of the year or the attacks in Saudi last September. Possibly due to this being a more localised issue, and less likely to result in military intervention, on a significant scale, by the US or another Western power.</li></ul>",

Note that the long bond saw the most selling pressure earlier in the session on the back of the US Treasury announcing it would be increasing its maturity offerings with a new 20-year bond, to launch in 2020. By settlement, the Treasury curve was steeper, with the 2-year yield little changed whilst the 30-year yield was 3bps higher. More broadly, the T-Note future settled little changed on the week, where participants digested a slew of factors, including another strong week of corporate issuance, the Phase 1 deal signing and a mixed bag of data (lacklustre CPI against firm retail sales), all in the background of US equity bourses continuing to push to new all-time-highs.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY is rangebound and antipodeans only partially nurse recent losses amid a very light calendar, with minimal gains seen in both AUD and NZD following the PBoC’s firmer reference rate setting and surprise hold on the Loan Prime Rate.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat and hold near the key 152.00 level despite BoJ in the market for JPY 810bln in up to 5yr JGBs, with participants remaining on the fence as the central bank also begins its 2-day policy meeting.&nbsp;</p>",
