US President Trump also announced in a tweet that talks &ldquo;are going very well&rdquo;, though negotiations are still ongoing. Talks were said to continue tomorrow, with some seeing this as a positive signal that the two sides are in serious negotiations and working hard to solve the disagreements between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The UK Government was defeated in a vote over an amendment to the finance bill, meaning that the government must win parliamentary approval for a no-deal before it can amend tax laws to cope with leaving EU without a deal; this effectively makes a no-deal Brexit a more complicated outcome. The vote therefore signals opposition in among MPs to a no-deal scenario, but does not change how things will play out since, should PM May fails to get her deal though the Commons, a disorderly Brexit remains the default outcome. A UK government spokesperson also stated that the amendment does not change the fact the UK is leaving the EU on March 29th. In newsflow, a UK PM May spokesman confirmed that the cabinet discussed the meaningful vote on Tuesday which, subject to Parliament, is to go ahead on January 15th. The spokesperson also reported that PM May is currently seeking assurances from the EU that neither UK nor the EU want to use the backstop and that, if used, it would be a temporary solution. He went on to say that the finance bill amendment is not desirable, but its effect would only be an inconvenience. PM May was also said to reaffirm that it is not government policy extending Article 50; this came amid earlier reports in The Telegraph that UK and EU leaders are in talks to possibly extend article 50 past March 29th with UK Brexit Minister Barclay highlighting real obstacles with the process of extending the legislation. On the EU sides, sources suggested that there will not be a summit and there are no actual talks, only some discussions on reassurances which may not even come before the vote next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> US President Trump expressed in a tweet confidence on the US economy but once again indirectly criticised the Fed noting that &ldquo;it would have been so easy&rdquo; with long term zero rates rather than with the normalised rates in place today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Hansson (Hawk) stated that the ECB rate guidance is rather precise assuming the economy is on track, and noted that the labour market data are &quot;unexpectedly positive&quot;. He believes the balance of risk has not shifted following the recent data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOLTS: </strong>Job openings hit a five-month low in November, falling to 6.888mln from 7.079mln, missing expectations of 1.063mln. Wells Fargo points out that normally &ldquo;the high level of job openings is consistent with strong demand for workers, but the pullback over the past few months suggests that payroll growth is likely to moderate&rdquo;. Additionally, even if a pullback in opening is not uncommon in months when hiring surges, Wells Fargo does not anticipate much of a rebound for December after 312k jobs were added. This argument is also reinforced by the quit rate which remains high despite seen a moderation from summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.26 HIGHER AT USD 49.78/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.39 HIGHER AT USD 58.72/BBL.</strong> Crude prices posted their sixth consecutive day of price gains today, as market sentiment improved over ongoing trade talks, with the expectation of a breakthrough that would spur global growth. However, analysts are cautious after reports that the sides were not ready to conclude a deal and had rather &ndash; for now &ndash; just narrowed differences. Elsewhere, the Saudi backed Arab Petroleum Investment Corp set mid-2019 oil price estimates at USD 60-70 per bbl. At 16:30 ET the API will release its inventory estimates (4 Jan) ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s DOEs, where crude is expected to draw by 2.8mln barrels, gasoline is expected to build by 1.9mln barrels and distillates are expected to build by 3.4mln barrels; Genscape forecast a draw of 267,000 barrels at Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +0.97% at 2574, NDX +0.98% at 6552, DJI +1.09% at 23787. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.84%, Materials +1.01%, Industrials +1.41%, Cons Discretionary +1.14%, Cons Staples +0.96%, Healthcare +0.95%, Financials 0.00%, Tech +0.90%, Telecoms +1.58%, Utilities +1.26%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The new largest US public company, Amazon (AMZN), helped pushed indices higher on the open. Union Pacific (UNP) was an outperformer on the day as it named its new COO and received upgrades from Cowen and RBC. Monster (MNST) opened higher following an upgrade at SunTrust. Positive trade sentiment saw gains in stocks such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) on the open, before paring back some gains in later trade. Verizon (VZ) traded higher following its announcement of strong Q4 additions. Yet another abysmal day for PG&amp;E (PCG) as S&amp;P removed its credit rating from investment grade. Chipmakers including NVIDIA (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) all underperformed on the back of Samsung cutting its earnings estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLE 9+ TICKS LOWER AT 121-24.</strong> Treasuries remained in negative territory on Tuesday as optimism over US and China trade talks pushed stocks higher. The yield curve saw decent bear-flattening once again with shorter dated yields higher by c.6 bps and the longer end only higher by c.4bps at settlement. The complex hit new sessions lows just after the auction. The US Treasury sold USD 38bln in 3yr notes tailing by 0.4bps at a high yield of 2.559%, the lowest yield since April. Demand was relatively weak as showed by the bid-to-cover of 2.44x the lowest since April 2009. Directs&rsquo; demand was secured as they secured the largest share since December 2015, indirects were awarded the smallest portion since July, and dealers were left with a share below recent average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 10-YEAR SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 38bln of 3-year notes on Tuesday, USD 24bln of 10-year notes on Wednesday, and USD 16bln of 30-year bonds on Thursday, all to settle 15 January; there are no reinvestments in the upcoming auctions. Barclays notes that December&rsquo;s reopening of the 10-year note saw weaker demand, with bid-to-cover falling to 2.65x vs an average of 2.56 in the March/June/September re-openings (the first re-openings). The bank notes performance at auctions was stronger in the second half of 2018 (seeing an average stop-through of 0.1bps vs an average 0.2bps tail in the first half of the year). Barclays also notes that &ldquo;indirect participation declined from a post-crisis high of 74% in November to 63% in December, largely due to the reduced participation from foreign investors,&rdquo; while &ldquo;direct bidders increased participation to 11%, some of which can be attributed to domestic investors increasing take down to 58%.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> Another attempt at 96.000 amidst WSJ reports that China and the US have narrowed differences on trade and progress was made on issues including the purchases of US goods and services, however Global Times later reported that talks have not concluded after &ldquo;tough work&rdquo; and dialogue are to continue tomorrow. This comes ahead of the FOMC Minutes tomorrow with focus on the balance sheet&rsquo;s narrative. In terms technical levels, the index&rsquo;s 100 DMA stands 95.991 while to the upside 96.734 is highlighted as its 50 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>Overall a choppy day for the Pound as the Dollar took over from the vague and contradictory reports from earlier in the day. To recap, Sterling saw upside and reached levels just shy of 1.2800 as Irish PM Varadkar stated that the EU are willing to offer fresh written assurances on the backstop, ahead of House of Commons meaningful vote next week (with a PM May spokesman confirming the 15th Jan). Sterling then lost steam and retreated to around 1.2750 amid lack of clarity on the so-called assurances alongside the EU repeatedly stating that Brexit negotiations are not to be reopened and Brexiteers desiring an overhauled deal. Cable has seen further downside in recent trade as the pair fell through its 50 HMA at 1.2750 to print a fresh intraday low of 1.2708 after the UK government faced a defeat a finance bill. From a technical perspective to the downside, the pair&rsquo;s 100 and 200 HMA stands at 1.2677 and 1.2681 respectively. EUR followed similar price actions with an initial dent due the release of disappointing German industrial output which ING and Lloyds highlight increases the risk of a German recession. This, alongside a strengthening greenback and 1bln in option expiries between 1.1425-35 saw EUR/USD fall from levels just shy of 1.1450 to a low print of 1.1423. In terms of the next levels to the downside, aside from the psychological 1.1400, the pair&rsquo;s 50 DMA stands at 1.1370.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie was initially underpinned by the 6th consecutive rise in oil prices as USD/CAD shrugged off the wider than expected trade deficit, ahead of the BoC interest rate decision tomorrow where the Central Bank is widely expected to stand pat on rates at 1.75% (full preview available on the research suite). In recent trade however, the CAD has been giving way to the firmer USD and as such, the pair trades nearer to the top of a 1.3268-3310 range, with offers reported above 1.3300, just below its 50 DMA at 1.3316.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Marginally firmer on the day as the latest trade developments ignited some safe-haven demand. US-Sino talks are said to have been scheduled for tomorrow following &ldquo;tough works&rdquo; according to the Global Times. In terms of technical for USD/JPY, 50 HMA sits at 108.53 with its 100 DMA further below at 108.28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Antipodeans remain on the backfoot as the high-beta currencies react sensitive to trade-related fundamentals alongside dollar influence. AUD/USD sees clean air from its 50 DMA to the psychological 0.7100 while NZD/USD clipped its 200 HMA at 0.6709 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.6705.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW:</strong> FOMC Meeting Minutes (Dec 2018). FOMC to release its December 2018 meeting minutes at 1900 GMT/1400 ET on 9 January 2019. The minutes are expected to show some signs the FOMC is tilting dovishly, though the Fed&rsquo;s more accommodating commentary is unlikely to be fully captured in the minutes, given much of the pivot occurred in speeches post the December FOMC meeting. Traders will be mindful of comments regarding the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet run-off policy (currently on autopilot) after Chair Powell and NY Fed President Williams signalled there may be some flexibility if required. Elsewhere, following the November meeting minutes, traders will be attentive to further discussion on moving away from the &lsquo;further gradual increases&rsquo; language. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20881/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>BOC Rate Decision (Jan 2019). The BOC to publish its rate decision and Monetary Policy Report on 9 January 2019 at 1500 GMT (1000 ET); Gov Poloz and Dep Gov Wilkins press conference at 1615 GMT (1115 ET). The Bank of Canada is expected to maintain its policy interest rate at 1.75%. The meeting will feature updated economic projections, as well as a post-meeting press conference with Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins. Given that rates are expected unchanged, markets will be assessing the general bias the Bank is signalling via its new forecasts: Scotiabank expects the BOC to retain guidance that &lsquo;the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target&rsquo; while also emphasising its patient approach in getting there, with a data-dependent approach. TD Securities notes that expectations for BOC hikes have collapsed over the last two months, with the money markets implied terminal rate falling from 2.52% in November to around 1.85%. &ldquo;Moreover, the BAX curve is now downward sloping through 2020, which suggests that markets have started thinking about rate cuts next year,&rdquo; TD adds. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20880/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

Analysts at Barclays observe that as auction sizes have steadily increased throughout the course of 2018, demand has trended lower, and cover at the December auction was 2.59x, near the low-end of the year compared with 3.13 at the beginning of 2018. &quot;Auctions experienced persistent weakness in the second half of the year, tailing an average of 0.3bps, compared with stopping through 0.1bps in the first half of the year,&quot; the bank writes. December&#39;s auction saw the return of the direct bid (13% takedown) after collapsing to 3% in November, and Barclays says this pickup was due to an increased takedown from domestic investors (up to 45% in December from 35% in November).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY &ndash; Another attempt at 96.000 amidst WSJ reports that China and the US have narrowed differences on trade and progress was made on issues including the purchases of US goods and services, however Global Times later&nbsp;reported that talks have not concluded after &ldquo;tough work&rdquo; and dialogue are to continue tomorrow. This comes ahead of the FOMC Minutes tomorrow with focus on the balance sheet&rsquo;s narrative. In terms technical levels, the index&rsquo;s 100 DMA stands 95.991 while to the upside 96.734 is highlighted as its 50 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; Overall a choppy day for the Pound as the Dollar took over from the vague and contradictory reports from earlier in the day. To recap, Sterling saw upside and reached levels just shy of 1.2800 as Irish PM Varadkar stated that the EU are willing to offer fresh written assurances on the backstop, ahead of House of Commons meaningful vote next week (with a PM May spokesman confirming the 15th Jan). Sterling then lost steam and retreated to around 1.2750 amid lack of clarity on the so-called assurances alongside the EU repeatedly stating that Brexit negotiations are not to be reopened and Brexiteers desiring an overhauled deal. Cable has seen further downside in recent trade as the pair fell through its 50 HMA at 1.2750 to print a fresh intraday low of 1.2711 amidst USD influence. From a technical perspective to the downside, the pair&rsquo;s 100 and 200 HMA stands at 1.2677 and 1.2681 respectively. EUR followed similar price actions with an initial dent due the release of disappointing German industrial output which ING and Lloyds highlight increases the risk of a German recession. This, alongside a strengthening greenback and 1bln in option expiries between 1.1425-35 saw EUR/USD fall from levels just shy of 1.1450 to a low print of 1.1423. In terms of the next levels to the downside, aside from the psychological 1.1400, the pair&rsquo;s 50 DMA stands at 1.1370.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; The Loonie was initially underpinned by the 6th consecutive rise in oil prices as USD/CAD shrugged off the wider than expected trade deficit, ahead of the BoC interest rate decision tomorrow where the Central Bank is widely expected to stand pat on rates at 1.75% (full preview available on the research suite). In recent trade however, the CAD has been giving way to the firmer USD and as such, the pair trades nearer to the top of a 1.3268-3310 range, with offers reported above 1.3300, just below its 50 DMA at 1.3316. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF &ndash; Marginally firmer on the day as the latest trade developments ignited some safe-haven demand. US-Sino talks are said to have been scheduled for tomorrow following &ldquo;tough works&rdquo; according to the Global Times. In terms of technical for USD/JPY, 50 HMA sits at 108.53 with its 100 DMA further below at 108.28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; Antipodeans remain on the backfoot as the high-beta currencies react sensitive to trade-related fundamentals alongside dollar influence. AUD/USD sees clean air from its 50 DMA to the psychological 0.7100 while NZD/USD clipped its 200 HMA at 0.6709 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.6705.</p>\r\n",

The Bank of Canada is expected to maintain its policy interest rate at 1.75%. The meeting will feature updated economic projections, as well as a post-meeting press conference with Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins. Given that rates are expected unchanged, markets will be assessing the general bias the Bank is signalling via its new forecasts: Scotiabank expects the BOC to retain guidance that &lsquo;the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target&rsquo; while also emphasising its patient approach in getting there, with a data-dependent approach. TD Securities notes that expectations for BOC hikes have collapsed over the last two months, with the money markets implied terminal rate falling from 2.52% in November to around 1.85%. &ldquo;Moreover, the BAX curve is now downward sloping through 2020, which suggests that markets have started thinking about rate cuts next year,&rdquo; TD adds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

The minutes are expected to show some signs the FOMC is tilting dovishly, though the Fed&rsquo;s more accommodating commentary is unlikely to be fully captured in the minutes, given much of the pivot occurred in speeches post the December FOMC meeting. Traders will be mindful of comments regarding the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet run-off policy (currently on autopilot) after Chair Powell and NY Fed President Williams signalled there may be some flexibility if required. Elsewhere, following the November meeting minutes, traders will be attentive to further discussion on moving away from the &lsquo;further gradual increases&rsquo; language.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

Unilever (-0.2%) are in the red after being downgraded at UBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Choppy day for the buck as the index recovered lost ground overnight and tested 96.000 (vs. intraday low 95.620) to the upside before pulling back to around 95.750 as markets await further details on US-Sino trade-related dialogue and US CPI later in the week. The dollar has re-gained traction in EU trade to retest the big figure ahead of US President Trump&rsquo;s speech on the Southern border at 2100EST/0200GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; A volatile day for the Pound as vague and contradicting Brexit reports emerge with initial upside in Sterling seen following comments from Irish PM Varadkar, who stated that the EU are willing to offer fresh written assurances on the backstop, ahead of House of Commons meaningful vote next week. Subsequently, Cable rose to levels just shy of 1.2800 shortly before retreating to around 1.2750 amid lack of clarity on the so-called assurances alongside the EU repeatedly stating that Brexit negotiations are not to be reopened and Brexiteers desiring an overhauled deal. GBP has been relatively indecisive overnight as Telegraph reports that UK and EU leaders are said to be in talks over extending Article 50 were shortly shot down by a Downing St. spokesman. Brexit Minister Barclay emerged during early EU trade to also deny the aforementioned Telegraph reports, whilst also adding that the process of the A50 extension is too complex. From a technical perspective, Cable resides just below its 50 DMA (1.2773) while options see 353mln expiring at 1.2770 at today&rsquo;s NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; On the backfoot following a dollar-dominated Asia-Pac session as the single currency was slightly dented by the release of disappointing German industrial output which ING and Lloyds highlight increases the risk of a German recession. This saw EUR fall from levels just shy of 1.1450 to a low print of 1.1433. In terms of technicals, the pair&rsquo;s 100 DMA lies at 1.1477 while a large 1bln in option expiries rests between 1.1425-35, potentially diluting some upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash;The antipodeans are the marked G10 underperformers, also falling victim to the greenback, with the Aussie initially pressured upon the release of a narrower than expected trade surplus overnight. As EU trade went underway, the NZD and AUD lost more ground to the buck with the former retreating further below 0.7150 to lows in close proximity of its 50 HMA around 0.7120. Meanwhile the latter sits nearer to the bottom of a 0.6730-60 range with its 100 DMA around 0.6680.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY- The Lira weakens for a second consecutive day amid comments from Turkish President Erdogan who rejected US National Security Advisor Bolton&rsquo;s statement that the withdrawal of US troops from Syria depend on certain conditions, including Turkish assurances that the Kurds in Northern Syria would be safe. Given the possible repercussions on the relationship between Turkey and the States, USD/TRY rose past 5.4000 to a high print of 5.4767 (vs. low of 5.3800) ahead of the next psychological level at 5.5000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Fixed income has started the day on the back foot, with Bunds bearing the brunt of the pre-supply concession (supply coming from the UK, US and a German linker) as the risk tone turns marginally positive, with equities slowly tracking higher throughout the European morning. This has seen both Bunds and Gilt 10-years trade in close proximity to session lows (163.50 and 123.08) with technical traders eyeing 163.42 (Dec 28th low) and 123.00 next up should any more risk-positive market tones be struck. In the periphery, BTPs are outperforming their Core EU peers but are still lagging in the red and languish around session lows of 126.02 with traders mindful of any further Banca Carige developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, USTs are conforming to the risk-on tone with most of the action in the long end of the curve and 10-year futures finding some support at the January 2nd low of 121-26 before the first note/bond supply of the year in the form of the 3yr auction with USD 38bln up for grabs, with the JOLTS report also in focus after last week&rsquo;s blockbuster labour report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.6%) and WTI (+1.5%) in the green, trading within a range of around USD 1.0/bbl as there have been no new major catalysts. Positive risk sentiment is predominantly fuelled on trade talk optimism between the US and China; where Chinese Vice Premier Liu He unexpectedly attending the talks, which were scheduled to be held at a vice-ministerial level. Elsewhere, the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister says he hopes India will seek another US waiver on Iranian sanctions. Separately, the Arab Petroleum Corp expects oil prices to trade between USD 60-70/bbl by the middle of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.4%) is down as the dollar recovered lost ground overnight, alongside an improvement in risk sentiment as markets are optimistic that a deal can be reached between US and China. Separately, China have restarted their gold purchases following a two-year break; with 0.32M/oz of the yellow metal added to their reserves in December 2018. Canadian sources state that the US and Canada are not currently, or scheduled to begin, negotiating to lift metal tariffs; despite reports that discussions had been held on steel tariffs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arab Petroleum Investment Corp expects oil prices to trade between USD 60-70/bbl by mid-2019.

Meanwhile the latter sits nearer to the bottom of a 0.6730-60 range with its 100 DMA around 0.6680.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY- The Lira weakens for a second consecutive day amid comments from Turkish President Erdogan who rejected US National Security Advisor Bolton&rsquo;s statement that the withdrawal of US troops from Syria depend on certain conditions, including Turkish assurances that the Kurds in Northern Syria would be safe. Given the possible repercussions on the relationship between Turkey and the States, USD/TRY rose past 5.4000 to a high print of 5.4767 (vs. low of 5.3800) ahead of the next psychological level at 5.5000.</p>\r\n",

This has seen both Bunds and Gilt 10-years trade in close proximity to session lows (163.50 and 123.08) with technical traders eyeing 163.42 (Dec 28th low) and 123.00 next up should any more risk-positive market tones be struck. In the periphery, BTPs are outperforming their Core EU peers but are still lagging in the red and languish around session lows of 126.02 with traders mindful of any further Banca Carige developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, USTs are conforming to the risk-on tone with most of the action in the long end of the curve and 10-year futures finding some support at the January 2nd low of 121-26 before the first note/bond supply of the year in the form of the 3yr auction with USD 38bln up for grabs, with the JOLTS report also in focus after last week&rsquo;s blockbuster labour report</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said there is a good chance of a good settlement with China on immediate trade though structural issue and compliance are harder, while US Secretary of State Pompeo said we are making progress with China.

However, a UK Downing Street spokeswoman later stated that UK PM May has always said we would leave the EU on March 29th and that we would not extend Article 50. (Telegraph/Newswires) Instead, UK PM May is said to be pinning her hopes on a last-minute offer from Brussels to avoid her Brexit deal suffering a defeat at the House of Commons on the 15th January. (FT) Furthermore, UK PM will today be urged &lsquo;play hardball&rsquo; with the EU by offering UK lawmakers a vote on her deal with the condition that they would be able to decide at a later date whether or not to enter the Irish backstop. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said to mull move to restrict no-deal Brexit threat by accepting an amendment to the finance bill to block a no-deal Brexit by limiting tax hours. (ITV)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITV&#39;s Paul Brand tweeted: Understand if (when) PM loses the Meaningful Vote on Tues, cabinet expect to be called to a meeting the next day to decide Plan B. One cabinet member suggests to me that&rsquo;s likely to be a rerun - a second vote.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY recovered lost ground and eyes a retest of the 96.00 level which in turn has resulted to a pullback in EUR/USD and GBP/USD to trade at the mid-1.14 and 1.27 handles respectively. The latest Brexit related news has been conflicting and therefore inconclusive for price action as reports initially suggested UK and EU leaders were in talks regarding possibly extending the Article 50 Brexit process, although a Downing Street spokeswoman later downplayed the prospects of an extension. Elsewhere, AUD was briefly pressured following a narrower than expected trade surplus and amid a softer CNH, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were elevated on the risk appetite seen during US hours although briefly succumbed to some mild profit taking overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(Nov) 1925M vs. Exp. 2230.0M (Prev. 2316.0M).

Elsewhere, gold was weighed amid a firmer greenback and as reports also noted gold imports by India (regular contender for the world&rsquo;s largest gold importer) may have dropped by around 20%, while copper prices continued to ease after having plateaued on Monday and amid a mixed risk tone overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India gold imports may have declined by 23% Y/Y in December and may have declined by 20% for 2018. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a range-bound overnight session, treasuries saw some upside in tandem with bunds as European traders sat at their desks and as equities sold off in early trade. Nonetheless, as risk sentiment improved and as stock indices turned green, opening higher in the US, the complex reversed course and drifted lower, also shrugging off disappointing Non-Mfg PMIs. The yield curve saw some modest bear-flattening as short dated yields were higher by c.5bps while longer date yields were higher by less than 1bps. 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps, 5s30s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps. US T-note futures (H19) settled 8 ticks lower at 122-01+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Donald Trump is to deliver a primetime address about the border on Tuesday night.

ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) got a tailwind from their counterparts stateside where focus centred on the resumption of trade talks between the world&rsquo;s 2 largest economies which was surprisingly attended by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who is also a top economic adviser to President Xi, while recent currency flows were also favourable for Japanese stocks. Conversely, KOSPI (-0.3%) lagged following disappointing preliminary Q4 results from index giant and tech heavyweight Samsung Electronics, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.2%) were indecisive after another liquidity drain by the PBoC and with weakness seen in auto names led by Geely following a near-40% decline in December sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid gains in Japanese stocks although strong results at the 10yr auction, later provided a floor for prices.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed as the region fails to take full advantage from the performance on Wall St where US-China trade hopes saw all US majors extend on recent gains. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) are positive amid a tailwind from their counterparts stateside with focus centred on the resumption of trade talks between the world&rsquo;s 2 largest economies which was surprisingly attended by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who is also a top economic adviser to President Xi, while recent currency flows has also been favourable for Japanese stocks. Conversely, KOSPI (-0.1%) lags following disappointing preliminary Q4 results from index giant and tech heavyweight Samsung Electronics, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) are indecisive following another liquidity drain by the PBoC and with weakness seen in auto names led by Geely following a near-40% decline in December sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains at a sub-96.00 level although has recovered some of the recent loss ground, which in turn has resulted to a mild pullback in EUR/USD and GBP/USD which trade at the mid 1.14 and 1.27 handles respectively. The latest Brexit related news has been conflicting and therefore inconclusive for price action as reports initially suggested that UK and EU leaders were in talks regarding possibly extending the Article 50 Brexit process, although a Downing Street spokeswoman later downplayed the prospects of an extension. Elsewhere, AUD was only briefly pressured following a narrower than expected trade surplus and despite a softer CNH, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were elevated on the risk appetite seen during US hours but have since succumbed to some mild profit taking overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid gains in Japanese stocks and with participants also sidelined ahead of a 10yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
