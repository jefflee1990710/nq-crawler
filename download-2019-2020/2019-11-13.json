(Newswires)</p><p>Fed Chair Powell said the current stance of monetary policy is 'likely to remain appropriate' as long as incoming data is largely consistent with the economic outlook and the baseline outlook for the economy remains favourable but noteworthy risks to the outlook remain. Powell also stated that persistent below-target inflation may lead to a slide in the longer-term inflation expectations and repeated if developments result in a material reassessment of the Fed's outlook then the Bank will respond accordingly. Furthermore, Powell suggested the labour market is not sending any signal that it is too hot and that there is a lot to like about the labour market today, while he does not see wages moving upwards in an inflationary manner and noted negative interest rates would certainly not be appropriate in the current environment.

There was some modest upside after the WSJ article on US/China trade talks hitting a snag, though the moves weren’t anything to write home about.

ECB’s de Guindos, Lane, de Galhau. <strong>Supply: </strong>UK 30yr. <strong>Earnings: </strong>Merck (GY), National Grid, Burberry Group, Walmart, NVIDIA, Viacom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP:</strong> The market shed gains after WSJ reported China trade talks had hit a “snag”, with China hesitant to agree to a figure for ag. purchases or enforcement mechanisms, reversing fresh ATHs made earlier in the US session. However, albeit a negative shock, the move in ES was within ranges, with limited moves seen across other major asset classes; however, as traders digested the details, equities pared losses, for the SPX to trade flat. The risk-off tone was evident in European morning trade, with the financial sector weighed on by downbeat earnings from the Dutch bank, ABN AMRO. US CPI data in the pre-market, saw the headline beat expectations, but the data failed to garner much attention, where participants looked towards comments by Fed Chair Powell (released at the cash open), with the Fed chair largely sticking to the script. Accordingly, the North American open followed the tone of APAC and Europe, with cash equities falling at the open. Although a turnaround was seen shortly after, with stronger energy prices seeing the sector lead the pact. Participants are now looking towards Cisco (CSCO) earnings aftermarket - a tech bellwether - after the bell to get a glimpse into global demand, followed by Walmart (WMT) on Thursday, which will speak to the strength, or lack of, from the US consumer.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> China trade talks had hit a “snag” and Beijing was reluctant to commit to a nominal figure of agricultural purchases, WSJ reported. The article also suggested that China did not want the deal to seem one sided, in addition to it resisting US demands for enforcement mechanisms and curbs on forced tech transfers. In regard to auto tariffs, Trump said that he had been fully briefed on them and that he would be making a decision fairly soon; reports earlier in the week suggested Trump was likely to delay the tariffs by six months again to focus on China. Looking back to Trump’s NY Econ Club speech on Tuesday, which lacked substance on key issues, SocGen's analysts argued (before the WSJ piece release) that Trump's remarks suggest that there are still some loose ends that need tying up, hence risk assets, bond yields and USDJPY have stalled. It also noted that the China side had gone quiet, in contrast to last week, when the roll-back of tariffs was being reported as a done deal.</p><p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL:</strong> In his testimony to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, Fed Chair Powell largely stuck to the script, as the Street was generally expecting. He repeated that the Fed's policy stance was \"likely to remain appropriate\" as long as incoming data was consistent with the Fed's outlook, repeating that if developments cause a material re-assessment in the Fed's outlook, it will respond accordingly. Powell was again upbeat on the US economy stating that the baseline remains favourable, and the Fed foresees a sustained expansion of activity, along with strong labour markets and inflation near its symmetric 2.0% goal as the most likely outcome. However, Powell did note that noteworthy risks to the US outlook still remain, with sluggish global growth and trade developments posing risks. Powell also warned that persistent below-target inflation might weigh on longer-term inflation expectations. Looking at asset prices, Powell noted that the level of vulnerabilities in the financial system were moderate, and investor appetite for risk was elevated in some asset classes, though the core of the financial sector appeared resilient. Powell also warned that the high level of US government debt might restrain the ability of fiscal policymakers to support the US economy in the event of a downturn.</p><p><strong>* US CPI:</strong> There was a small upside surprise, with headline CPI rising 0.4% M/M against an expected rise of 0.3%, on the back of energy prices; the Y/Y rate ticked up by one-tenth to 1.8%. The Core M/M printed 0.2%, in line with the expected, while the core Y/Y rate rose by one-tenth to 2.4% (which some analysts said was consistent with the Fed's preferred PCE gauge running at a clip slightly below 2.0%). Analysts said that the larger rise in headline prices was on the back of higher gasoline prices, with little signs of September tariff hikes lifting consumer prices, just yet (ahead of the release of the October data, analysts had suggested the impact may be more visible in the November data). \"We had expected to see some inflationary impact from the latest tranche of tariffs on Chinese imports imposed in early September, but prices of clothing and household furnishings declined in October,\" Capital Economics said, \"meanwhile, there are some signs that underlying price pressures are beginning to moderate again, with shelter prices rising by a muted 0.1% m/m.\" Overall, however, Capital Economics argues that the October CPI data suggests core inflation is levelling off close to the Fed's 2% target, and that barring any sharp slowdown in economic activity, that supports the Fed’s stance of leaving interest rates on hold for an extended period.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US President Trump said he and Turkish President Erdogan had talked about F-35 jets and expect a solution will be found, following the two meeting in Washington on Wednesday. In Hong Kong Chinse Universities will reportedly cancel all of their on-campus classes as violence continues; schools are also shut. In China, Global Times noted US warship movement is under the surveillance of Chinese military, with a PLA Eastern Command Spokesman adding it will defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. US Defense Secretary Esper said the US is open to alterations in military activity on the Korean Peninsula to support North Korea diplomacy.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ:</strong> After releases signalled weaker NZ inflation expectations at the beginning of the week, pricing had more meaningfully tilted towards the rate cut camp; however, the RBNZ stood pat, holding rates at 1.00% and the&nbsp; central bank arguing that developments since the August MPS did not warrant a change: (1) it said that NZ exports have held up well, while the terms of trade firm; 2) A lower NZD is serving to offset weaker global growth; 3) The impact of already undertaken easing was flowing into the economy; 4) Wages and non-tradeable inflation has been rising; 5) The economy is near full-employment; 6) longer-term inflation expectations are anchored. And since the August MPS report, data has come in in-line with, or better than the RBNZ had projected. TD Securities -- who was in the minority, and foresaw an unchanged decision -- said that the statement was not as dovish as it had anticipated; \"There does not appear any urgency by the RBNZ to act at this point, with Gov Orr indicating monetary conditions are very stimulative at the moment,\" and \"the key RBNZ forecasts are consistent with this view.\" However, TD notes that despite the positives stated above, the RBNZ suggests we are not out of the woods yet, with the post-meeting statement acknowledging that \"the risks to the economy in the near term were tilted to the downside and agreed it would add further monetary stimulus if economic developments warranted it\". Looking ahead, TD Securities is expecting a further lowering of rates, but says February's meeting may be too soon. \"The RBNZ appears quite comfortable with current monetary policy settings, and our forecast for the RBNZ to cut in February is looking less likely.\" TD states that there are other factors that could enter the RBNZ equation: \"Does the market return to pricing in the Fed cutting rates, the RBA moving towards QE and trade war tensions returning?\" But in the near-term, the market is less likely to consider these as options. \"With the RBNZ appearing in no rush to cut, and the possibility the RBNZ announces an easing in high LVR restrictions later this month, it makes a February cut harder to justify.\"</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO: </strong>EIA released its short-term energy update; it cut 2019 world oil demand growth by 90k BPD to a 750k BPD Y/Y rise and raised 2020 world oil demand growth by 70k BPD to a 1.37mln BPD Y/Y increase. US crude output is expected to rise 1.3mln BPD to 12.29mln BPD in 2019 (prev. forecast expected a 1.27mln BPD increase), while output is expected to rise 1mln BPD to 13.29mln BPD in 2020 (prev. forecast expected a rise to 13.17mln BPD). Finally, the EIA said crude production is to exceed an average of 13mln BDP in Q4 2019, earlier than previous forecasts.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.32 HIGHER AT USD 57.12/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 62.37/BBL.</strong> Crude markets are higher, having pared early losses as macro sentiment turned around during US trading hours. Trade concerns had seen the complex fall as low as USD 56.20/bbl and USD 61.22/bbl in WTI and Brent front month contracts, before composure was regained the complex moved as high as USD 57.21/bbl and USD 62.55/bbl on the day. Potentially also providing some support to the price action; OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said the fundamentals of global economy remain strong and that crude demand numbers for 2020 have the potential for an upside swing. Moreover, he said that there could be a sharp reduction of supply estimates going into 2020, especially from US shale. Looking ahead, API Inventory data is set to be released after the US equity market close; crude stocks are seen building by 1.6mln bbls (as has been the case for over a month), gasoline is seen drawing 1.1mln bbls and distillates drawing 0.8mln bbls. Meanwhile, Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks drawing 1.2mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 128-28+: </strong>Yields were lower across the curve, with a bias towards narrower curve spreads, with the complex largely trading off of the over-arching risk tone from the APAC session and early European session, traversing sideways through US trade; US CPI, and a testimony from Fed chair Powell were digested with ease. There was some modest upside after the WSJ article on US/China trade talks hitting a snag, though the moves weren’t anything to write home about.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 3094, NASDAQ-100 -0.1% at 8260, Dow Jones 0.3% at 27783.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.4%, Consumer Staples 0.9%, Energy -0.5%, Financials -0.6%, Health Care 0.1%, Industrials -0.4%, Information Technology 0.3%, Materials -0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 1.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Disney (DIS) caught a bid on strong Disney+ launch figures, Netflix (NFLX) chilled to the downside. Caterpillar (CAT) opened lower after disappointing 3-month rolling sales figures. Chesapeake Energy (CHK) surged on reports of a potential deal with Comstock. Tech Data (TECD) was firmer after Apollo agreed to buy it out for USD 5.4bln. Mosaic (MOS) fell victim to a downgrade at JPMorgan to Underweight. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) traded volatile after reports they were the focus of an FTC probe.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Datadog (DDOG) made double digit gains after beating EPS and Revenue estimates, whilst exceeding street expectations for guidance. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) opened lower, despite beating top and bottom line, after weak guidance. SmileDirectClub (SDC) dived lower amid guidance for more losses. Canada Goose (GOOS) was hit after disappointing guidance, despite a strong quarter.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> USD traded marginally flat/firmer on Wednesday, yet again trading in tight ranges. DXY saw highs within a whisker of 98.50, and lows of 98.289, just above the 50dma at 98.285. EUR relatively subdued today; we remain on the look out for a definitive decision on US tariffs of European autos, which Trump said could be made soon. Haven’s were bid in early trade. with USDJPY trickling further beneath the 109 handle on a soft risk tone, aided by rate differentials; the 200dma as prices continue to be lead by anti-climatic update.&nbsp; XAU slightly firmer today trading in an approximately 10 buck range, while CHF was bid; SNB’s Jordan reiterated policy with negative rates and a readiness to intervene is still necessary, highlighting the CHF being overvalued. EURCHF currently trades around ~1.09 level, with some noting that the 1.10 mark is regarded as an indicative level below which the SNB may consider an upgrade to its language on the CHF. NZD an outperformer today, as it rose by the most in a single day since January, sending NZDUSD above 0.64 after the RBNZ stood pat on policy despite expectations for a cut, stating that developments did not warrant a change to the already stimulatory monetary setting at this time. In EMFX, TRY regained some strength amid a friendly tone between President Trump and Erdogan in Washington. ZAR also slightly firmer against the buck despite continued Eskom worries and bleak SA retail sales. MXN weaker against the greenback briefly breaching 19.50 to the upside ahead of Thursday’s Banxico rate decision that could culminate in a bigger than forecast ½ point reduction. RUB also weaker despite some traction from firmer than consensus Russian Q3 growth, and a mild bounce in Brent.</p><p><strong>* AUSTRALIA WAGES:</strong> The Aussie wage price index eased to 0.5% Q/Q and 2.2% Y/Y, in line with market expectations. The weakness in the data resulted in Australian bank Westpac stating that it would reassess its forecast for wage inflation to get back to 2.4% Y/Y in 2020; \"Clearly, if policymakers would like to use market mechanisms to lift wages, they have a lot more work to do to get the unemployment rate down to a level that will generate a broad based sustainable wages pulse.\" The data comes ahead of Thursday's labour market data, which is expected to show 15k jobs being added to the Australian economy in October (prev. 14.7k), and the jobless rate likely to tick-up by one-tenth to 5.3% (participation expected unchanged at 66.1%).</p><p><strong>* BANXICO PRIMER: </strong>Ten of the 14 analysts surveyed by Reuters look for Banxico to cut rates by 25bps to 7.50%, which would be the third successive rate cut, given low growth (0.1% in Q3), stable inflation (3.02% in October, the middle of Banxico’s 2-4% range), rising unemployment (up to 3.8% this October from 3.2% last year) and a relatively stable MXN continuing to give the bank room for further easing. A cut would also keep pace with the US Federal Reserve, which has also cut rates three times since the summer, with the US central bank now suggesting that its insurance cuts have concluded, and it has re-adopted its data-dependent stance, could also dissuade the board from taking more aggressive action. Four analysts polled by Reuters look for a deeper 50bps rate cut, following soft GDP data in Q3 (NOTE: two of the bank’s five board members voted for a 50bps cut at the last meeting). However, most desks argue that the board will err against providing the market with any kind of dovish surprise. TD Securities argues that \"increasing the easing trajectory would likely result in the market pricing in too aggressive an easing profile into Mexican assets (steps of 50bps instead of 25bps)... could degrade the relatively EM-leading, and peso-supportive yield that has been crucial in minimizing the external risks to inflation (via violent MXN depreciation) that have allowed Banxico to begin its easing process in the first place.\" Other factors contributing to a more cautious approach by Banxico include; the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of another sharp increase in the minimum wage in 2020 and the risk of policy-triggered market instability following policy announcements by the Mexican administration, or the US ahead of the Presidential election campaign season. Looking ahead, markets expect Banxico finally “de-couple” from the Fed with a 25bps cut in December, after which the bank is then expected to pursue further easing. Money markets have priced in 75bps worth of easing through the year-end (including the potential 25bps cut this week). With real rates well within restrictive territory at near 4% combined with the benign inflation outlook, analysts at ING see the Banxico delivering a steady pace of 25bp cuts, until the policy rate drops to 6.5% at least.</p>",

US crude output is expected to rise 1.3mln BPD to 12.29mln BPD in 2019 (prev. forecast expected a 1.27mln BPD increase), while output is expected to rise 1mln BPD to 13.29mln BPD in 2020 (prev. forecast expected a rise to 13.17mln BPD). Finally, the EIA said crude production is to exceed an average of 13mln BDP in Q4 2019, earlier than previous forecasts.</li><li>Crude markets are higher, having pared early losses as macro sentiment turned around during US trading hours. Trade concerns had seen the complex fall as low as USD 56.20/bbl and USD 61.22/bbl in WTI and Brent front month contracts, before composure was regained the complex moved as high as USD 57.21/bbl and USD 62.55/bbl on the day. Potentially also providing some support to the price action; OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said the fundamentals of global economy remain strong and that crude demand numbers for 2020 have the potential for an upside swing. Moreover, he said that there could be a sharp reduction of supply estimates going into 2020, especially from US shale. Looking ahead, API Inventory data is set to be released after the US equity market close; crude stocks are seen building by 1.6mln bbls (as has been the case for over a month), gasoline is seen drawing 1.1mln bbls and distillates drawing 0.8mln bbls.

Hardly any independent direction derived via US CPI data as the headline y/y rate printed a tad firmer than forecast in contrast to the core measure, while Fed chair Powell’s text for the JEC largely reiterated October policy guidance and the shift to pause mode with optionality to react if the favourable economic assessment changes (deteriorates) materially.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has been flouting the overall risk averse trend ever since the RBNZ decided to stand pat overnight against expectations for a ¼ point ease, and Governor Orr followed up with the explanation that there is no urgent need to provide more stimulus as unfolding data since August’s more aggressive than anticipated 50 bp OCR cut has essentially been offsetting (ie weaker than forecast releases countered by upside surprises). Nzd/Usd is nudging 0.6400 again awaiting more from Orr later.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Chief beneficiaries of the deterioration in sentiment following US President Trump’s NY Economic Club testimony that raised more negatives than positives regarding Phase 1 of the trade deal with China and pushback of auto tariffs awaiting the official announcement due some time later today. The Franc continues to test resistance around 0.9900 and 1.0900 vs the Greenback and Euro respectively, not to mention the resolve of the SNB that underlined the importance of NIRP and currency intervention to curb Chf strength/demand in fragile market conditions. Meanwhile, the Yen rebounded further from recent lows circa 109.50 against the Dollar, through 109.00, a 108.88 Fib and is now eyeing 108.65 (November 7 low for Usd/Jpy) in the run up to Japanese Q3 GDP data.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/GBP/AUD</strong></p><p>All on a softer footing vs the Buck, with the single currency unable to break above 1.1000, but also holding just above Fib support just under the round number in the form of a 1.0994 Fib, while the Loonie also derived some technical momentum or encouragement from the fact that the 200 DMA at 1.3277 was respected and pared losses from around 1.3268 through 1.3250. Elsewhere, Sterling has straddled 1.2850 with little reaction to UK CPI, but some pressure exerted by Brexit Party Leader Farage ramming home the message that no more candidates will be withdrawn and all Remainers will be contested at the forthcoming GE. Back down under, the Aussie has been lagging well behind its Antipodean and US peers sub-0.6850 and just shy of 1.0670 at one stage respectively awaiting further US-China trade developments and a speech from RBA Deputy Governor Bullock.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK/EM</strong></p><p>A partial reprieve for the Swedish and Norwegian Kronas after early EU declines in wake of benign Swedish inflation readings as Riksbank’s Floden stuck to December tightening guidance regardless and the technical backdrop turned less bearish. Meanwhile, mixed fortunes in the EM arena where the Lira regained some poise pending news from the Turkish President Erdogan and his US adversary Trump meeting, but the Rand hampered by Eskom strife and bleak SA retail sales and the Mexican Peso defensive ahead of Thursday’s Banxico rate decision that could culminate in a bigger than forecast ½ point reduction. Conversely, the Rouble gleaned some traction from firmer than consensus Russian Q3 growth, and a mild bounce in Brent.</p>",

Looking ahead, UBS says expects 12-month headline CPI to rise to 2.9% by late Spring due to the pass-through of tariffs not being rolled back, while core PCE is projected to hold steady around 1.7% Y/Y in October, before rising to 2.3% by late Spring.&nbsp;</li><li>TD Securities says the recent rally in breakevens suggests that the market is more optimistic on breakeven inflation, which TD believes creates asymmetric risks into the CPI report.

All in all, and taken in combination with the statement, it indicates that the Fed's mid-cycle adjustment is over, and the Fed is now in a data-dependent approach to policy.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-calendar?id=E1F7F9B1-57F9-41E1-A5B9-ACAB77784B48\">Link to Stream</a></li></ul>",

Potentially contributing to the jitters; today is the approximate deadline for US President Trump to make a decision on EU auto-tariffs. European autonames, including Peugeot (-2.7%) and BMW (-2.0%), are amongst the underperformers. Sector performance is reflective of the markets lack of risk appetite; the more defensive Consumer Staples (+0.7%), Utilities (-0.5%) and Health Care (+0.2%) sectors are the outperformers, the latter buoyed by gains in GlaxoSmithKline (+0.5%), whose Phase III study of Nucala met its primary endpoint.

Conversely, soft earnings from Lanxess (-3.3%) saw the Co.’s shares pressured. Elsewhere, ArcelorMittal (-3.5%) shares were on the back foot on the news that Italy’s Foreign Minister said he did not seek Chinese investors for the Ilva plant and it would be too soon to discuss alternative options. Finally, Tullow Oil (-26.0%) sunk on after the Co.’s FY19 group oil production forecast came in slightly below guidance, largely due to performance in Ghana.</p><p>Alibaba (BABA) is reportedly testing investor appetite for an up to USD 15bln offering that prices this month; may offer stock at 5% discount in Hong Kong, according to Nikkei citing sources.

To recap, the Bank confounded forecasts for a 25 bp cut that were underpinned and actually rising in wake of a dip in NZ inflation projections just ahead of the latest policy meeting, but the RBNZ opted to hold fire given no immediate need to ease further at the current juncture and with Governor Orr noting that data since the August assessment has been broadly balanced (netting beats and misses vs consensus). Conversely, Aud/Usd is languishing towards the base of a 0.6825-60 range and Usd/Cad has rebounded back above 1.3250 amidst a broad downturn in risk appetite and less optimism on the global trade front after US President Trump failed deliver good news about Phase 1 or auto tariffs late yesterday.</p><p><strong>CHF - </strong>The next best G10 performer and only partially heeding more verbal SNB intervention following a meeting with the Swiss Government to discuss a variety of issues, but pertinently fragile FX markets and a Franc that is still deemed to be highly valued. Usd/Chf skirting 0.9900 and Eur/Chf 1.0900.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/EUR - </strong>All relatively flat or rangebound against the Buck as Cable pivots 1.2850 and largely shrugs off UK inflation data including headline CPI that slowed to 1.5% vs 1.6% expected, but bang in line with the BoE estimate, while the Yen straddles 109.00 and Euro holds above 1.1000, albeit after a miniscule downside breach and as the DXY drifts back from a fresh recent peak of 98.449 to the middle of its band (down to 98.289 at the other extreme).</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK - </strong>The Scandi Crowns are slipping in wake of more Swedish data raising questions over the Riksbank’s commitment to hiking the repo in December, with Eur/Sek up over 10.4400 at one stage and Eur/Nok soaking up offers at 10.1600 before fading and also fuelled by a retracement in crude prices</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Amidst widespread losses vs the Dollar, Usd/Zar has revisited 15.0000+ territory against the backdrop of Eskom’s ongoing power travails and with SA retail sales missing the mark by some distance. However, Usd/Try is hovering below highs ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his US peer and Usd/Rub is meandering mid-range into Russian Q3 GDP and after the Finance Minister pulled a 2025 OFZ offering.</p><p><strong>RBNZ kept the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 1.00% vs. consensus for a 25bps cut, while it said it is prepared to act and will add further monetary stimulus if needed</strong> but noted <strong>economic developments do not warrant a change to monetary policy at this time</strong> and that low rates, as well as government spending will support domestic demand. RBNZ Governor Orr also commented there was no urgency to further ease at this point and suggested ups and downs in data since the August statement broadly offsets each other, while RBNZ's Hawkesby commented that data will determine what the RBNZ does. (Newswires)</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>- EUR/USD: 1.1015 (550M), <strong>1.1035-50 (1.5BLN)</strong></p><p>- EUR/GBP: <strong>0.8500 (1.1BLN),</strong> 0.8550 (200M), 0.8650 (350M), 0.8700 (755M)</p><p>- USD/CAD: 1.3150 (266M), <strong>1.3215 (1BLN),</strong> 1.3260 (425M)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bonds </strong>have eased back off best levels, but remain firmly bid and in demand almost across the board amidst a deeper retracement in risk assets after US President Trump underwhelmed in terms of bullish trade expectations. <strong>Bunds, Gilts</strong> and 10 year <strong>US T-notes </strong>have been as high as 170.25, 131.41 and 128-27+, with the former somewhat stymied by a rather lacklustre German auction and with the focus shifting to a packed pm agenda including CPI, Fed chair Powell and colleagues.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>The crude complex is lower,</strong> in fitting with the market’s risk-off feel. Front month <strong>WTI and Brent futures</strong> have been moving lower in line with equities, with WTI earlier testing Monday’s USD 56.25/bbl low and Brent easily clearing this level and making progress towards last week’s USD 60.70/bbl low (although, at USD 61.30/bbl, Brent is still some way off). In terms of crude specific developments; ahead of the December 5-6th OPEC and OPEC+ meetings, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said it is too early to say if further output cuts are needed. As a reminder; sources have noted that Saudi Arabia and Russia do not want to bear the brunt of deeper reductions, with the former wanting members to comply with the current pact, which could see around 500k BPD out of the market. In separate news, the IEA forecast that global oil demand growth is expected to slow from 2025 as fuel efficiency improves and the use of electrified vehicles increases but is unlikely to peak in the next two decades. Elsewhere, Nigeria's NNPC said current crude output stands at 1.6-1.7mln bpd (vs. 1.93mln in October), and assured the nation will continue to comply with OPEC cuts. Looking ahead, EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook is set for release in the afternoon, followed by API Inventory data after the US equity market close, both having been delayed one day due to a Monday holiday in the US. Over in metals, <strong>gold prices</strong> are modestly firmer and Copper softer, as the broader lack of risk appetite gives havens a boost at the expense of more risk sensitive assets. Following a steep decline so far in the month of November, the precious metal has managed to stabilise, and reclaim the USD 1460/oz mark from USD 1450/oz lows. Meanwhile, downside for <strong>copper</strong> is being cushioned on the news that further strikes are disrupting operations at Chilean Codelco's northern copper mines.</p><p>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo says it is too early to say if further output cuts are needed. (Newswires)</p><p>IEA said the world energy outlook central scenario is for global oil demand growth to rise 1mln bpd annually to 2025 then increase 100k bpd annually during 2030s, while it sees oil prices at nearly USD 90/bbl in 2030 and USD 103/bbl in 2040.

Finally, Tullow Oil (-26.0%) sunk on after the Co.’s FY19 group oil production forecast came in slightly below guidance, largely due to performance in Ghana.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>NZD/AUD/CAD - In stark contrast to its non-US Dollar counterparts and other high beta/risk sensitive currencies, the Kiwi is sharply outperforming, albeit off 0.6400+ overnight highs vs the Greenback and 1.0670 against the Aussie, on the back of an unexpected unchanged OCR from the RBNZ. To recap, the Bank confounded forecasts for a 25 bp cut that were underpinned and actually rising in wake of a dip in NZ inflation projections just ahead of the latest policy meeting, but the RBNZ opted to hold fire given no immediate need to ease further at the current juncture and with Governor Orr noting that data since the August assessment has been broadly balanced (netting beats and misses vs consensus). Conversely, Aud/Usd is languishing towards the base of a 0.6825-60 range and Usd/Cad has rebounded back above 1.3250 amidst a broad downturn in risk appetite and less optimism on the global trade front after US President Trump failed deliver good news about Phase 1 or auto tariffs late yesterday.</p><p>CHF - The next best G10 performer and only partially heeding more verbal SNB intervention following a meeting with the Swiss Government to discuss a variety of issues, but pertinently fragile FX markets and a Franc that is still deemed to be highly valued. Usd/Chf skirting 0.9900 and Eur/Chf 1.0900.</p><p>GBP/JPY/EUR - All relatively flat or rangebound against the Buck as Cable pivots 1.2850 and largely shrugs off UK inflation data including headline CPI that slowed to 1.5% vs 1.6% expected, but bang in line with the BoE estimate, while the Yen straddles 109.00 and Euro holds above 1.1000, albeit after a miniscule downside breach and as the DXY drifts back from a fresh recent peak of 98.449 to the middle of its band (down to 98.289 at the other extreme).</p><p>NOK/SEK - The Scandi Crowns are slipping in wake of more Swedish data raising questions over the Riksbank’s commitment to hiking the repo in December, with Eur/Sek up over 10.4400 at one stage and Eur/Nok soaking up offers at 10.1600 before fading and also fuelled by a retracement in crude prices</p><p>EM - Amidst widespread losses vs the Dollar, Usd/Zar has revisited 15.0000+ territory against the backdrop of Eskom’s ongoing power travails and with SA retail sales missing the mark by some distance. However, Usd/Try is hovering below highs ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his US peer and Usd/Rub is meandering mid-range into Russian Q3 GDP and after the Finance Minister pulled a 2025 OFZ offering.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bonds have eased back off best levels, but remain firmly bid and in demand almost across the board amidst a deeper retracement in risk assets after US President Trump underwhelmed in terms of bullish trade expectations. Bunds, Gilts and 10 year US T-notes have been as high as 170.25, 131.41 and 128-27+, with the former somewhat stymied by a rather lacklustre German auction and with the focus shifting to a packed pm agenda including CPI, Fed chair Powell and colleagues.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The crude complex is lower, in fitting with the market’s risk-off feel. Front month <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures have been moving lower in line with equities, with <strong>WTI</strong> earlier testing Monday’s USD 56.25/bbl low and Brent easily clearing this level and making progress towards last week’s USD 60.70/bbl low (although, at USD 61.30/bbl, Brent is still some way off). In terms of crude specific developments; ahead of the December 5-6th OPEC and OPEC+ meetings, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said it is too early to say if further output cuts are needed. As a reminder; sources have noted that Saudi Arabia and Russia do not want to bear the brunt of deeper reductions, with the former wanting members to comply with the current pact, which could see around 500k BPD out of the market. In separate news, the IEA forecast that global oil demand growth is expected to slow from 2025 as fuel efficiency improves and the use of electrified vehicles increases but is unlikely to peak in the next two decades. Elsewhere, Nigeria's NNPC said current crude output stands at 1.6-1.7mln bpd (vs. 1.93mln in October), and assured the nation will continue to comply with OPEC cuts. Looking ahead, EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook is set for release in the afternoon, followed by API Inventory data after the US equity market close, both having been delayed one day due to a Monday holiday in the US. Over in metals, <strong>gold</strong> prices are modestly firmer and Copper softer, as the broader lack of risk appetite gives havens a boost at the expense of more risk sensitive assets. Following a steep decline so far in the month of November, the precious metal has managed to stabilise, and reclaim the USD 1460/oz mark from USD 1450/oz lows. Meanwhile, downside for <strong>copper</strong> is being cushioned on the news that further strikes are disrupting operations at Chilean Codelco's northern copper mines.</p>",

However, the 10 year UK benchmark retains a solid underlying bid on renewed risk aversion or at least less bullish sentiment surrounding global trade after remarks from US President Trump on the current state of play failed to match the upbeat hype stirred by reports that the first part of a wider deal is in the offing. Turning to today’s domestic agenda, CPI data will take centre stage, albeit with little potential to move markets given consensus for steady headline and core readings. Back to Liffe, Gilts are hovering around 131.00 between 130.86-131.07 parameters vs yesterday’s 130.78 close.</p>",

In fact his comments could be construed quite incendiary as he warned that no deal would illicit even higher tariffs, and he also refrained from talking about auto levies in the context of a potential rollback. Looking at Eurex price action thus far, Bunds have been in a 169.94-67 range, awaiting Eurozone IP, 10 year German issuance, US CPI and Fed speak including chair Powell at the JEC.</p>",

(Twitter) <strong>Tariffs are reportedly emerging as the main stumbling block for US and China to reach a limited trade deal, according to sources.

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> briefly slipped below the 109.00 handle due to the subdued risk appetite and antipodeans outperformed with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> boosted after the RBNZ’s surprise decision to keep the OCR unchanged in which it stated it will act if needed but added that economic developments do not warrant a change to monetary policy at this time.</p><p><strong>RBNZ kept the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 1.00% vs. consensus for a 25bps cut, while it said it is prepared to act and will add further monetary stimulus if needed</strong> but noted economic developments do not warrant a change to monetary policy at this time and that low rates, as well as government spending will support domestic demand. RBNZ Governor Orr also commented there was no urgency to further ease at this point and suggested ups and downs in data since the August statement broadly offsets each other, while RBNZ's Hawkesby commented that data will determine what the RBNZ does. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities were mostly lower with price action subdued by the broad risk averse tone which weighed on <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures towards USD 56.50/bbl where prices eventually found support. There were also recent comments from a Gulf OPEC delegate which suggested the unlikelihood for deeper production cuts as the resulting increase in prices from such action would spur a boost in US output and effectively nullify their efforts, while focus now shifts to the upcoming inventory reports which were delayed due to this week’s Veterans Day. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were marginally supported by safe-haven demand but with gains limited by a steady greenback, and <strong>copper</strong> languished at this month’s lows amid the widespread downbeat sentiment.</p><p>IEA said the world energy outlook central scenario is for global oil demand growth to rise 1mln bpd annually to 2025 then increase 100k bpd annually during 2030s, while it sees oil prices at nearly USD 90/bbl in 2030 and USD 103/bbl in 2040.

(Fox/Twitter)</p><p><strong>NEC Director Kudlow said US President Trump has asked him to work on tax reform 2.0 but did not provide any details as it is too early</strong>, while Kudlow said he does not think the US needs negative rates right now as the economy is in a strong place and noted the yield curve is normalising which is a good thing. (CNBC)</p><p>White House Economic advisers are reportedly considering whether to campaign on a 15% tax rate proposal for middle class income earners. (Washington Post)</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawk)</strong> said policy is in a mildly accommodative place after the rate cuts this year and current inflation is not the worst outcome given that expectations seem well anchored. Barkin added he does not expect rate cuts to make a big difference in investment and that weak investment is more a product of overall climate for business, uncertainty over trade, regulation and geopolitics. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Harker (Non-Voter, Hawk)</strong> said he was against the October rate cut and that by lowering rates further at this point the response won't be what is expected because the cost of capital is not holding businesses back, while Harker added he is currently not for raising nor lowering rates and that monetary policy is about neutral or slightly accommodative. Harker also suggested that in the case of a recession the best response is not negative rates but larger fiscal stimulus and the first line of defense would be bringing rates to zero as well as asset purchases. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kashskari (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said he is feeling a little bit better about the US economy than a few months ago and there is a lot of consensus at the Fed that monetary policy is modestly accommodative, while he added that modestly accommodative policy is appropriate.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are lower across the board and US equity futures have pulled back from record levels amid continued uncertainty and disappointment following US President Trump’s speech at the Economic Club of New York which failed to provide any fresh insight on US-China trade, with news the USTR office will submit a report on possible auto tariffs to the White House also clouding over the risk climate. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) are lower as weakness in the energy, mining and financials sectors weigh on Australia, while Tokyo is also subdued by declines in commodity stocks and detrimental currency inflows. Hang Seng (-2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) conform to the downbeat tone after US President Trump largely stuck to the script regarding US-China trade but also renewed his criticism on China and threatened higher tariffs if they fail to reach an agreement, with the losses in Hong Kong exacerbated again amid no end in sight for the ongoing disruption which has already plunged the city into a recession.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY continues to trade sideways within a tight range following the lack of fresh trade insights from US President Trump who also renewed his criticism on the Fed and called for negative rates. The greenback’s major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD subdued as it just about holds onto the 1.1000 handle following mixed German ZEW data and the lingering threat of auto tariffs stateside, while GBP/USD consolidates around 1.2850 due to light pertinent newsflow and with the latest polls by Survation and YouGov continuing to suggest the Conservatives remain ahead of the opposition Labour Party, albeit by a varying degree of 6-13 points. Elsewhere, USD/JPY briefly slipped below the 109.00 handle due to the subdued risk appetite and antipodeans outperform with NZD/USD boosted after the RBNZ’s surprise decision to keep the OCR unchanged in which it stated it will act if needed but added that economic developments do not warrant a change to monetary policy at this time.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are in recovery mode after the prior day’s slump with the rebound aided by support around 152.50 and the broad risk averse tone in the region.</p>",
