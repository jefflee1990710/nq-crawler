Furthermore, President Trump thinks the US China trade deal will end up very well and had earlier tweeted that US can make a deal with China tomorrow but added that it must be a great deal for the US or it does not make any sense, while he also stated that when the time is right we will make a deal with China and suggested that it will all happen much faster than people think. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>Senior administration officials said a trade deal with China isn't close and that the US could be in for a long trade war, while an official also said the differences between the two sides are so profound that, based on his read of the situation, he can't see the fight getting resolved before the end of the year.

(Newswires)</p><p>UK PM May will tell opposition Leader Corbyn that she intends to hold a 2nd reading vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the second week of June, whether or not a deal with Labour has been reached, setting an effective deadline to the negotiations, according to The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn. However, there were also reports that UK opposition Labour party leader Corbyn reiterated to PM May that they will not back her Brexit plan without concessions. (Twitter/Newswires)</p><p>BBC Political Editor Kuenssberg tweeted “Labour sources say ‘no chance’ Brexit bill passes in first week June - is PM trying to use terror post EU elex meltdown to get backbenchers to come onside? Or just in the business of eking the authority she has left, day by day”. (Twitter)</p><p>Cross-party talks between the UK government and Labour may collapse on Thursday, according to ITV's Peston.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Coca-Cola (KO) caught a bid after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, outperforming on the Dow on the day. Walmart (WMT), although moving higher on the day, was largely unable to benefit from news that the co would offer one day delivery across the US without a membership fee. Correspondingly, Target (TGT) moved lower. Boeing’s (BA) share price shrugged off reports that the FAA had determined senior officials at the aircraft maker did not sufficiently monitor safety assessments of 737 MAX features implicated in the crash. Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after the social media giant informed European regulators of a “serious security vulnerability” in WhatsApp, where hackers were able to inject commercial Israeli spyware to phones by using the app’s call function. General Motors (GM) was on the front foot after investors settled a bankruptcy related dispute involving JP Morgan, the US and Canadian governments. Tesla (TSLA) shares were buoyant as US President Trump administration officials stated their support for legislation that would boost electric vehicle supply chains. Ralph Lauren (RL) shares sunk, despite the apparel maker reporting earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines. Uber (UBER) rose but was unable to recoup a meaningful portion of the prior day’s losses, and saw some negative ticks as new emerged that underwriters deployed a ‘naked short’ on concerns the IPO might be in trouble. Deere &amp; Co (DE) was under pressure after receiving a downgrade from JP Morgan Chase, the investment bank citing “rapidly deteriorating” fundamentals in US agriculture as well as declining China demand due to tariffs and a fall in hog herds due to swine fever. S&amp;P 500 +0.8% at 2835, NASDAQ 100 +1.1% at 7402, Dow Jones +0.8% at 25534.</p><p>Treasury yields rose by around 2bps across the curve, as risk sentiment stabilised on Tuesday, following Monday’s risk-off induced by trade war anxieties; however, the complex is yet to completely pare Monday’s rise. (It is also worth noting that, earlier in the session, the Treasury complex once again took its cue from EGBs; Italy's Deputy PM Salvini said he was “willing to break EU fiscal rules,” which added some positive ticks in the bond complex.). As on Monday, the complex saw a more risk-friendly configuration following (another batch of) optimistic comments from US President Trump, later in the US session, having previously criticised China on Twitter earlier in the day. Attention will at least focus on the US data slate for Wednesday, which includes US retail sales, industrial production, NAHB, and the Empire State manufacturing survey. At settlement, major curve spreads were flat-to-very-slightly steeper. US T-notes (M9) futures settled 3 ticks higher at 124-10+.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong> Equities up, Dollar up, Treasuries down, Crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>More Trump optimism on trade, Middle East tensions escalate further, Cross-party Brexit talks are close to collapse</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> AU Wage Data, CH Industrial Output, Retail Sales, FR CPI, EU GDP, CA CPI, US: Fed Manufacturing, Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Capacity Utilisation, Manufacturing Output, Business Inventories, NAHB Housing Market, EIA Weekly Crude Data, ECB’s Lane, Coeure, Praet, Fed’s Quarles, Barkin, Rosengren, George</p><p><strong>* TUESDAY’S EARNINGS:</strong> Europe; Bouygues, Credit Agricole, RWE, US; Cisco</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> In wake of the string of trade war escalations seen since the end of last week, sourced reports set the theme on Tuesday. CNN reported that trade talks between the US and China have come to a halt. Another report from Axios stated that administration officials said a trade deal with China is not close, and that the US could be in for a long trade war, whilst Politico, citing sources, reported that trade talks will continue even if USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin do not accept an invitation to go to Beijing; the process to go to a full trade war will take at least three months. US President Trump himself again put an upbeat spin on the situation, telling reporters that the trade conflict was a \"little squabble\" that could be resolved if China was willing to negotiate, adding that the US was in a strong position, dialogue was \"very good\" with China, and China wanted to make a deal. He also mentioned that he expects to know in 3-4 weeks about any possible China trade deal. Trump's comments again injected some optimism into markets, and risk assets ticked up in the aftermath of his remarks. Elsewhere, the China’s Global Times Editor said that he expects the trade war to continue longer than people expect, and that the US is deceiving itself if it thinks the tariffs will be beneficial to it.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed’s Williams and George (both voters) were both initially neutral in their comments today; both said that the current Fed stance is appropriate, and the US economy is in a good place. Williams added that tariffs had given a small boost to inflation and the larger the tariffs, the larger the boost to inflation. He also suggested that, in an era of lower neutral rates, a new approach to policy will be required. George commented that low inflation does not require a response and that she is not convinced that inflation being below target does not require an offsetting overshoot, whilst also warning against rate cuts, which may fuel an asset bubble and ultimately a recession.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>Tensions in the Middle East rose on Tuesday, with more attacks on Saudi Arabia, following Sunday’s attacks on its oil vessels; this time on two Saudi Aramco oil pumping stations in Riyadh. Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the attacks were carried out by drones laden with explosives, with the pumping stations on the east-west pipeline, a key shipping alternative to the Strait of Hormuz which Iran oversees. While no party has taken responsibility for the attacks, Iran is seen as the prime suspect, and the US said it believes proxies sympathetic to (if not working for) Iran may have attacked the tankers on Sunday off the coast in UAE; Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks. Prior to Tuesday’s attacks, a NY Times piece suggested that the US was mulling the deployment of 120k troops to the Middle East in preparation for the scenario that Iran may attack the US (another report from Newsweek suggested the Trump Administration is preparing multiple options, including air strikes and boots on the ground); however, President Trump denied this report. However, later reports suggested that the Trump Administration is preparing multiple military options for Iran, including airstrikes and setting-up a ground invasion. Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei and US Secretary of State Pompeo have both since said the two nations are not seeking war with each other. However, Khamenei said that Iran will not be negotiating with the US over the nuclear deal pact (Iran is looking to bypass US restrictions by maintaining the nuclear deal with European nations). Pompeo also said that the US would respond appropriately to any Iranian attacks on US interests. Throwing some water on the flames, Iraqi PM Abdul-Mahdi said that there are indications from its neighbour and the US that the situation will end well despite the current tensions.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Ministers set out details of the compromises which the government was prepared to consider in order to secure an agreement, and the Cabinet agreed to continue discussions with Labour to see what was possible. However, it was agreed that it is imperative to bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill in time for the summer parliamentary recess (how this is to be achieved remains unclear), a spokesperson for PM May said. Later, the UK government confirmed that it would hold vote on the WAB in the week starting 3 June. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour was more wary of compromise Brexit deal with UK PM May after former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson (a leading candidate to take over from PM May once she moves aside), along with Brexiteers Raab and McVey wrote a letter threatening to rip it up and overturn any agreement reached with Labour; Labour leader Corbyn has indicated that the only compromise he'd accept would involve staying in the customs union. Cross-party talks are yet to yield any meaningful progress, and PM May's spokesperson intimated that ministers were becoming more resigned to having to try to pass the Brexit legislation without Labour support; however, talks may be nearing an end: ITV’s Peston suggested that talks could collapse on Thursday. In spite of the lack of progress so far, PM May and opposition leader Corbyn met tonight for further talks; reports suggested that Corbyen was expecting May possibly to offer a Customs Union that would last until the next general election, where parties could then decide their own manifestos; May is also likely to have informed Corbyn that she intends to hold a second reading vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in second week of June, whether or not a deal with Labour has been reached, setting an effective deadline to the negotiations. The Spokesperson also said the subject of UK PM May's resignation did not feature in the Cabinet talks on Tuesday, but pressure on her remains; The backbench 1922 committee's executive noted that PM May could face moves to oust her as soon as Thursday if she does not set a date for her departure. Elsewhere, the EU was cool on news that UK Brexit negotiator Robbins is heading to Brussels on Wednesday to renegotiate the political declaration; EU said it would remain on a 'Brexit break' until something changes in the UK.</p><p><strong>* US NFIB: </strong>Optimism among small business in the US rose in April (+1.7 to 103.5, beating the Street's view). Wells Fargo said that the labour market indicators remained extremely positive, although hiring at small firms has begun to moderate. The bank also said that trade news may drag the index lower in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>* US IMPORT PRICES:</strong> Import prices +0.2% M/M (exp. +0.7%), rising less than expected on consumer deletion, capital goods and non-petrol fuel prices. The weakness in the data prompted analysts at Goldman Sachs to modestly revise its April core PCE estimates lower (now sees 0.24% M/M and 1.62 Y/Y vs 0.25% and 1.64% previously).</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> OPEC crude production was broadly unchanged in April at 30.03mln bpd. Crude oil output decreased mostly in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Angola, while production increased in Iraq, Nigeria and Libya. Total world oil demand growth in 2018 is estimated at 1.41mln bpd; unchanged from the prior report. Demand for OPEC crude in 2018 is estimated at 31.6mln bpd 1.6mln bpd lower than the 2017 level. For 2019, oil demand growth is forecast at around 1.21mln bpd; unchanged from the prior report. In 2019, demand for OPEC crude is forecast at 30.6mln bpd around 1.0mln bpd lower than the estimated 2018 level. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2018 was revised up by 10k bpd from the previous month’s report, mainly due to an upward revision to Canada’s supply in Q4 2018. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2019 was revised lower by 30k bpd to average 2.14mln BPD, mainly due to lower than expected output in 1Q19 in the US, Brazil and the UK, which is partially offset by upward revisions in China.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.74 AT USD 61.78/BBL; BRENT (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.01 LOWER AT USD 71.24/BBL. </strong>Oil prices rebounded on Tuesday, shaking-off trade war concerns and reacting to rising tensions in the Middle East. The surge was catalysed from early reports that two Saudi Aramco oil pumping stations, on the east-west pipeline, had been attacked in Riyadh, within days of the Saudi tankers being attacked. Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the attacks were a sabotage act targeted at global oil supply carried out by drones lade with explosives; Aramco temporarily shut down the east-west pipeline to assess the situation, before shortly bringing it back online. Energy analyst Anas Alhajji noted that the pipeline replaces the passage of oil through the Hormuz Strait, and as such a failure of this pipeline may increase Iran's influence of oil flow in the region. Elsewhere in supply, Russian oil flow via the Druzhba pipeline from Belarus to Poland and Germany is reportedly still suspended, following the oil contamination, with no clear indication of when normal flows will continue. In related news, a Polish Minister said he expects Russian oil supply to Poland to be restored quickly although it is hard to tell exactly how long restoration will take. Looking ahead, the API is reporting its weekly estimates of US energy inventories for the previous week, with crude, gasoline and distillates all expected to show draws in stocks: 0.8mln bbls, 0.3mln bbls, and 1mln bbls respectively. Genscape expects a build at Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub of 1.3mln bbls; it is worth noting that the recent troubles in the Houston shipping channel will not have had an affect on this week’s inventory data due to it occurring over the weekend.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 0.8% at 2835, NASDAQ-10 1.1% at 7402, Dow Jones 0.8% at 25534, SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary 0.9%, Consumer Staples 0.4%, Energy 1.1%, Financials 0.8%, Health Care 0.4%, Industrials 1.1%, Information Technology 1.6%, Materials 0.8%, Telecommunication Services 0.2%, Utilities -0.9%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Coca-Cola (KO) caught a bid after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, outperforming on the Dow on the day. Walmart (WMT), although moving higher on the day, was largely unable to benefit from news that the co would offer one day delivery across the US without a membership fee. Correspondingly, Target (TGT) moved lower. Boeing’s (BA) share price shrugged off reports that the FAA had determined senior officials at the aircraft maker did not sufficiently monitor safety assessments of 737 MAX features implicated in the crash. Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after the social media giant informed European regulators of a “serious security vulnerability” in WhatsApp, where hackers were able to inject commercial Israeli spyware to phones by using the app’s call function. General Motors (GM) was on the front foot after investors settled a bankruptcy related dispute involving JP Morgan, the US and Canadian governments. Tesla (TSLA) shares were buoyant as US President Trump administration officials stated their support for legislation that would boost electric vehicle supply chains. Ralph Lauren (RL) shares sunk, despite the apparel maker reporting earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines. Uber (UBER) rose but was unable to recoup a meaningful portion of the prior day’s losses, and saw some negative ticks as new emerged that underwriters deployed a ‘naked short’ on concerns the IPO might be in trouble. Deere &amp; Co (DE) was under pressure after receiving a downgrade from JP Morgan Chase, the investment bank citing “rapidly deteriorating” fundamentals in US agriculture as well as declining China demand due to tariffs and a fall in hog herds due to swine fever.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (M9) FUTURES SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 124-10+. </strong>Treasury yields rose by around 2bps across the curve, as risk sentiment stabilised on Tuesday, following Monday’s risk-off induced by trade war anxieties; however, the complex is yet to completely pare Monday’s rise. (It is also worth noting that, earlier in the session, the Treasury complex once again took its cue from EGBs; Italy's Deputy PM Salvini said he was “willing to break EU fiscal rules,” which added some positive ticks in the bond complex.). As on Monday, the complex saw a more risk-friendly configuration following (another batch of) optimistic comments from US President Trump, later in the US session, having previously criticised China on Twitter earlier in the day. Attention will at least focus on the US data slate for Wednesday, which includes US retail sales, industrial production, NAHB, and the Empire State manufacturing survey. At settlement, major curve spreads were flat-to-very-slightly steeper.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Yesterday’s save haven bid softened on Tuesday. <strong>JPY </strong>was unable to recoup losses after weak Japanese export figures as risk appetite returned, USDJPY ultimately consolidating back above 109.50; meanwhile <strong>XAU </strong>fell back beneath the key 1300 level, however, the key 1292 level held; <strong>CHF</strong> also traded weaker. <strong>USD </strong>gained momentum as US traders came to their desks and risk appetite returned to the market, and DXY consolidated around 97.50. Activity currencies, <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>, were generally higher across the session albeit the Aussie ended up flat going into APAC trade, other activity currencies such as <strong>NOK</strong> and <strong>SEK</strong>. <strong>EMFX </strong>performed well with <strong>CNH</strong> stable, despite the weaker fix from the PBOC overnight. <strong>EUR</strong>, conversely, was weaker, weighed by soft German sentiment data. <strong>GBP</strong> also weakened, with mixed/disappointing employment data and the prospect of an imminent collapse in cross-party Brexit talks doing little to lift sterling as cable headed back toward the 1.2900 handle.</p>",

(It is also worth noting that, earlier in the session, the Treasury complex once again took its cue from EGBs; Italy's Deputy PM Salvani said he was “willing to break EU fiscal rules,” which added some positive ticks in the bond complex.). As on Monday, the complex saw a more risk-friendly configuration following (another batch of) optimistic comments from US President Trump, later in the US session, having previously criticised China on Twitter earlier in the day. Attention will at least focus on the US data slate for Wednesday, which includes US retail sales, industrial production, NAHB, and the Empire State manufacturing survey. At settlement, major curve spreads were flat-to-very-slightly steeper.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT: OPEC crude production was broadly unchanged in April at 30.03mln bpd. Crude oil output decreased mostly in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Angola, while production increased in Iraq, Nigeria and Libya. Total world oil demand growth in 2018 is estimated at 1.41mln bpd; unchanged from the prior report. Demand for OPEC crude in 2018 is estimated at 31.6mln bpd 1.6mln bpd lower than the 2017 level. For 2019, oil demand growth is forecast at around 1.21mln bpd; unchanged from the prior report. In 2019, demand for OPEC crude is forecast at 30.6mln bpd around 1.0mln bpd lower than the estimated 2018 level. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2018 was revised up by 10k bpd from the previous month’s report, mainly due to an upward revision to Canada’s supply in Q4 2018. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2019 was revised lower by 30k bpd to average 2.14mln BPD, mainly due to lower than expected output in 1Q19 in the US, Brazil and the UK, which is partially offset by upward revisions in China.</p><p>* Oil prices rebounded on Tuesday, shaking-off trade war concerns and reacting to rising tensions in the Middle East. The surge was catalysed from early reports that two Saudi Aramco oil pumping stations, on the east-west pipeline, had been attacked in Riyadh, within days of the Saudi tankers being attacked. Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the attacks were a sabotage act targeted at global oil supply carried out by drones lade with explosives; Aramco temporarily shutdown the east-west pipeline to assess the situation, before shortly bringing it back online. Energy analyst Anas Alhajji noted that the pipeline replaces the passage of oil through the Hormuz Strait, and as such a failure of this pipeline may increase Iran's influence of oil flow in the region. Elsewhere in supply, Russian oil flow via the Druzhba pipeline from Belarus to Poland and Germany is reportedly still suspended, following the oil contamination, with no clear indication of when normal flows will continue. In related news, a Polish Minister said he expects Russian oil supply to Poland to be restored quickly although it is hard to tell exactly how long restoration will take. Looking ahead, the API is reporting its weekly estimates of US energy inventories for the previous week, with crude, gasoline and distillates all expected to show draws in stocks: 0.8mln bbls, 0.3mln bbls, and 1mln bbls respectively. Genscape expects a build at Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub of 1.3mln bbls; it is worth noting that the recent troubles in the Houston shipping channel will not have had an affect on this week’s inventory data due to it occurring over the weekend.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Not necessarily the biggest G10 movers on the day (at this juncture), but certainly among the headline-grabbers and both testing big figure levels/psychological support vs a broadly bid Dollar as the <strong>DXY </strong>bounces further from Monday’s post-Chinese tariff retaliation lows (very close to 97.000) and over the 30 DMA (97.403). Cable is hovering just above 1.2900 with Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour still grid-locked on divergent demands and UK PM May facing a date of destiny with the 1922 committee, but Eur/Gbp has eased back from peaks not far off 0.8700 and 0.8722 resistance as the single currency is undermined by more Italian political and fiscal reverberations. Indeed, Eur/Usd has retreated further from May highs (1.1265) towards 1.1200 in wake of more coalition unrest and warnings from Deputy PM Salvini that the Government will not sacrifice jobs to ensure the 3% deficit ceiling is not exceeded and/or keep debt below 130-140%.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>In contrast to yesterday when the mood was decidedly anti risk, safe-haven premium and positioning has been unwound, leaving the Yen and Franc weaker vs the Greenback and more generally. Usd/Jpy has bounced firmly within 109.15-77 parameters and looks set to close above a key technical level (109.23) after what appears a false break below and could be pivotal from a chart perspective, while Usd/Chf is close to the top of a 1.0087-51 range following soft Swiss producer and import prices. However, the Swiss unit remains firm against the single currency as the cross straddles 1.1300 and more indicative of still fragile sentiment, partly on the aforementioned Italian impulses, but also Brexit uncertainty and more sabre-rattling from President Trump and Beijing.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>Both narrowly mixed vs their US counterpart as the Loonie continues to roam between 1.3487 and 1.3456 and only gleaned fleeting impetus from a spike in oil prices on another attack on Saudi sites, while the Aussie remains closer to slightly deeper 0.6935 multi-month lows vs 0.6960 recovery highs on the back of bearish NAB business sentiment overnight.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK/NZD</strong></p><p>The clear outperformers, with Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok both down circa 0.5% around 10.7620 and 9.7890 respectively, as relatively firm Swedish CPI data supplemented the better risk tone and tech signals turned more bullish for the Scandi Crowns. Meanwhile, the Kiwi fared better than its antipodean peer as Nzd/Usd hovered in a 0.6562-91 band following a diversion of budget expenditure from the NZ Finance Ministry overnight.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Far from zero to hero, but an encouraging session for the Turkish Lira as data and more intervention (some $5.5 bn in total since last Thursday) combined to aid the Try through the 6.0000 handle again.</p>",

Sectors are mostly in the green with defensive sectors underperforming, in-fitting with the “less risk off” tone in the markets.&nbsp; DAX (+0.3%) marginally underperforms its peers as heavyweight Bayer (-2.7%) stumbled after the Co. lost a third trial related to claims its Roundup weed killer causes cancer and the jury awarded USD 2bln in punitive damages. Elsewhere, Renault (-2.5%) shares took a hit after its alliance partner Nissan cut operating profit forecasts whilst also slashing dividend. Sticking with autos, Volkswagen (-1.4%) shares were buoyed amid reports that the company decided to IPO Traton before the Summer break this year. Finally, as the European Q1 earnings season approaches its end, HSBC notes that from the 85% of EU companies that have reported, 55% topped estimates and the results are off the lows seen in Q4 2018 (49% beat). “Though the re-emergence of US-China trade tension remains a concern, we see limited downside to European earnings from here” says HSBC, whilst citing continuing improvement in earning revisions. Furthermore, The bank’s top-down model points to 2019 EPS growth of around 5.3%, marginally above expectations. Despite this, HSBC is underweight on Europe as US companies have outpaced its European counterparts and the “expected 2019 EPS growth forecast for Europe (c.5%) is lower than our [HSBC’s] EPS growth estimates for the US (7%) and global equities (8%)”, the bank concludes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> It’s too early to talk in terms of a turnaround Tuesday, but the risk pendulum has changed direction to the benefit of high beta currencies that were hit hard yesterday and to the detriment of safe-havens. The catalyst appears to be some respite in US-China trade anxiety as President Trump holds off on additional tariffs and remains optimistic that the 2 sides will reach an agreement down the line. The part reversal in sentiment has also helped the DXY recover some poise, albeit indirectly as a firm rebound in Usd/Jpy and Cable retreat combine to nudge the index back up from near 97.000 lows into a 97.270-390 range.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/CAD -</strong> The Kiwi is leading the comeback from Monday’s depths and is hovering just under 0.6600 vs its US peer, as NZ Finance Minister Robertson pledged to reallocate Nzd1 bn budget expenditure given that Brexit and the US-China tariff spat are both compounding risks faced by the nation’s exporters. Meanwhile, the single currency is holding above 1.1200 and outperforming Sterling near 0.8700 on renewed Brexit angst, with resistance not far above the big figure at 0.8722, and the Loonie has rebounded ahead of 1.3500 into a 1.3487-57 range. Back to Eur/Usd, a decent 1.2 bn option expiries at 1.1240 may influence direction into the NY cut as the pair meanders between 1.1244-20.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/GBP/AUD</strong> - As noted above, the Yen and Franc have lost their safe-haven allure, or at least some appeal, with shorts caught in Usd/Jpy as 109.00 support held and the headline pair squeezed back up to 109.77. Note, 109.50 was a double bottom and 109.23 a key Fib that was breached, but not on a closing basis and this exacerbated the snap back, along with similar tech and stop-fuelled retracements in Yen crosses, like Eur/Jpy and Aud/Jpy according to market contacts. Meanwhile, Cable finally relinquished 1.3000+ status, 100 and 200 DMAs (at 1.3011 and 1.2959 respectively) on the way down to a fresh mtd base (sub-1.2930) before paring some losses and largely shrugging off mixed UK jobs and earnings data. Similarly, the Aussie is lagging either side of 0.6950 following a downbeat NAB business sentiment survey overnight.</p><p><strong>SEK/TRY -</strong> Some respite for the Swedish Krona and Turkish Lira on top of the less risk averse environment in general as Swedish inflation eclipsed consensus to underscore the Riksbank’s view that it is broadly in line with target, while Turkish IP fell less than expected and latest reports suggest that its planned S-400 purchase from Russia may be shelved until 2020. Eur/Sek now closer to 10.7700 vs 10.8200+ at one stage and Usd/Try nearer 6.0500 than 6.1120 at the earlier high.</p><p>Australian NAB Business Confidence (Apr) 0 vs. Exp. 1 (Prev. 0, Rev. -1).

Indeed, the core German/Eurozone bond is back within a handful of ticks from early Eurex peaks in wake of a marked deterioration in ZEW economic sentiment that more than outweighed a beat in current conditions, while its UK peer actually eked a fresh Liffe best at 128.20 (-5 ticks vs -23 ticks at one stage) following softer than forecast wage data and against the backdrop of a well received 2054 syndicated issue. Ahead, US import and export prices and Fed’s George.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>WTI (+0.4%) and Brent (+0.7%) futures trended lower for much of the session, but have subsequently reverted into positive territory following reports that two Saudi Aramco oil pumping stations have been attacked; for reference, This pipeline replaces the passage of oil through the Hormuz Strait, and as such a failure of this pipeline may increase Iran's influence of oil flow in the region, as according to Energy Economist Anas Alhajji. Up until this Saudi update, news-flow had been light for the sector, although the OPEC Monthly report is due later today ahead of the API crude stocks report, with the headline expected to build by 2.8mln barrels. Elsewhere, Gold is relatively uneventful and holding onto most its gains just under the USD 1300/oz level, whilst copper prices are just off lows after the red metal tested USD 2.70/lb to the downside amid the heightened US-Sino trade tensions</p><p>Polish Minister expects the Russian oil supply to Poland to be restored quickly although it is hard to tell exactly how long restoration will take.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European stocks have nursed some losses from yesterday’s sell-off [Eurostoxx 50 +0.6%] in what seems to be (for now) a turn-around from the down-beat Asia-Pac session. Sectors are mostly in the green with defensive sectors underperforming, in-fitting with the “less risk off” tone in the markets.&nbsp; DAX (+0.3%) marginally underperforms its peers as heavyweight Bayer (-2.7%) stumbled after the Co. lost a third trial related to claims its Roundup weed killer causes cancer and the jury awarded USD 2bln in punitive damages. Elsewhere, Renault (-2.5%) shares took a hit after its alliance partner Nissan cut operating profit forecasts whilst also slashing dividend. Sticking with autos, Volkswagen (-1.4%) shares were buoyed amid reports that the company decided to IPO Traton before the Summer break this year. Finally, as the European Q1 earnings season approaches its end, HSBC notes that from the 85% of EU companies that have reported, 55% topped estimates and the results are off the lows seen in Q4 2018 (49% beat). “Though the re-emergence of US-China trade tension remains a concern, we see limited downside to European earnings from here” says HSBC, whilst citing continuing improvement in earning revisions. Furthermore, The bank’s top-down model points to 2019 EPS growth of around 5.3%, marginally above expectations. Despite this, HSBC is underweight on Europe as US companies have outpaced its European counterparts and the “expected 2019 EPS growth forecast for Europe (c.5%) is lower than our [HSBC’s] EPS growth estimates for the US (7%) and global equities (8%)”, the bank concludes.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - It’s too early to talk in terms of a turnaround Tuesday, but the risk pendulum has changed direction to the benefit of high beta currencies that were hit hard yesterday and to the detriment of safe-havens. The catalyst appears to be some respite in US-China trade anxiety as President Trump holds off on additional tariffs and remains optimistic that the 2 sides will reach an agreement down the line. The part reversal in sentiment has also helped the DXY recover some poise, albeit indirectly as a firm rebound in Usd/Jpy and Cable retreat combine to nudge the index back up from near 97.000 lows into a 97.270-390 range.</p><p>NZD/EUR/CAD - The Kiwi is leading the comeback from Monday’s depths and is hovering just under 0.6600 vs its US peer, as NZ Finance Minister Robertson pledged to reallocate Nzd1 bn budget expenditure given that Brexit and the US-China tariff spat are both compounding risks faced by the nation’s exporters. Meanwhile, the single currency is holding above 1.1200 and outperforming Sterling near 0.8700 on renewed Brexit angst, with resistance not far above the big figure at 0.8722, and the Loonie has rebounded ahead of 1.3500 into a 1.3487-57 range. Back to Eur/Usd, a decent 1.2 bn option expiries at 1.1240 may influence direction into the NY cut as the pair meanders between 1.1244-20.</p><p>JPY/CHF/GBP/AUD - As noted above, the Yen and Franc have lost their safe-haven allure, or at least some appeal, with shorts caught in Usd/Jpy as 109.00 support held and the headline pair squeezed back up to 109.77. Note, 109.50 was a double bottom and 109.23 a key Fib that was breached, but not on a closing basis and this exacerbated the snap back, along with similar tech and stop-fuelled retracements in Yen crosses, like Eur/Jpy and Aud/Jpy according to market contacts. Meanwhile, Cable finally relinquished 1.3000+ status, 100 and 200 DMAs (at 1.3011 and 1.2959 respectively) on the way down to a fresh mtd base (sub-1.2930) before paring some losses and largely shrugging off mixed UK jobs and earnings data. Similarly, the Aussie is lagging either side of 0.6950 following a downbeat NAB business sentiment survey overnight.</p><p>SEK/TRY - Some respite for the Swedish Krona and Turkish Lira on top of the less risk averse environment in general as Swedish inflation eclipsed consensus to underscore the Riksbank’s view that it is broadly in line with target, while Turkish IP fell less than expected and latest reports suggest that its planned S-400 purchase from Russia may be shelved until 2020. Eur/Sek now closer to 10.7700 vs 10.8200+ at one stage and Usd/Try nearer 6.0500 than 6.1120 at the earlier high.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Not much in the way of range extension, but the 10 year benchmarks have gradually pared losses from intraday lows of 166.31, 128.02 and 124-09 in Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries respectively. Indeed, the core German/Eurozone bond is back within a handful of ticks from early Eurex peaks in wake of a marked deterioration in ZEW economic sentiment that more than outweighed a beat in current conditions, while its UK peer actually eked a fresh Liffe best at 128.20 (-5 ticks vs -23 ticks at one stage) following softer than forecast wage data and against the backdrop of a well received 2054 syndicated issue. Ahead, US import and export prices and Fed’s George.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>WTI (+0.3%) and Brent (+0.2%) futures continue to trend lower with former the now below its 50 DMA (61.33) ahead of its 200 DMA (60.43) whilst the latter straddles just above the USD 70/bbl, 50 DMA (69.66) and 200 DMA (69.09). News-flow has been light for the sector, thus far, although the prices did see some upside amid reports that two Saudi Aramco oil pumping stations (9 and 8) have been attacked in the districts of Aldowdami and Afifi in Riyadh. Aramco has halted pimping in the east-west pipeline until the pipeline can be evaluated. As a reminder, the OPEC Monthly report is due later today ahead of the API crude stocks report, with the headline expected to build by 2.8mln barrels. Elsewhere, Gold is relatively uneventful and holding onto most its gains just under the USD 1300/oz level, whilst copper prices are just off lows after the red metal tested USD 2.70/lb to the downside amid the heightened US-Sino trade tensions.</p>",

The buying of Treasuries once again saw the implied probability of Fed rate cuts in 2019 rise (to around 70%, according to the CME’s Fedwatch tool, from around 60% at the end of last week). The complex came off highs in late US trade following some constructive commentary from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, as well as US President Trump suggesting that he will meet china President Xi at the G20 summit in June (while he also stated that he was yet to make a decision on whether to impose further tariffs on the remaining USD 325bln of Chinese imports. With a lack of A-list data this week, the focus will fall on the heavy slate of Fedspeak; however, initial indications suggest that FOMC policymakers will likely reiterate the message of neutral and patience as they assess the potential fallout from trade conflicts.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower as global risk sentiment remains pressured by the escalating US-China trade tensions, which resulted to substantial losses on Wall St. and the worst performance of the S&amp;P 500 in more than 4 months. This follows the tit-for-tat tariffs between the world’s 2 largest economies in which China announced its retaliatory tariffs affecting over 5000 US products at a rate of between 5%-25% despite US President Trump's warnings, while the USTR office later posted details of potential tariffs on remaining USD 300bln of Chinese goods. ASX 200 (-1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) are both negative with the declines in Australia led by continued underperformance in its largest weighted financials sector and amid losses in energy names after a retreat in oil prices, while Japanese exporters feel the brunt of the recent flows into JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were weaker with Hong Kong playing catch up on return from the extended weekend, although the mainland bourse briefly recovered as participants found some encouragement from a CNY 200bln MLF announcement, as well as rehashed comments by US President Trump that he will know in 3-4 weeks regarding trade discussions and that he feels talks will be successful.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady overnight as it takes a breather from the prior day’s volatility in which it initially fell on China’s tariff reprisal, but then bounced back after finding support within a whisker of the 97.00 level. EUR/USD attempts to nurse losses and GBP/USD languishes firmly below 1.3000 as the latest headlines suggest no progress was made in cross party talks and that UK PM May is to face cabinet pressure to abandon attempts for a compromise agreement, while a majority are said to be in favour of changing party rules to get rid of PM May if a timetable for her departure is not set at Thursday's meeting with the 1922 Committee. Elsewhere, the escalation of trade tensions initially spurred flows into safe-haven JPY and weighed on the high-beta antipodeans, although some of the moves were pared as USD/JPY rebounded from support at 109.00 and as optimism from US President Trump provided some overnight relief.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid a similar lacklustre tone in T-note futures and with participants sidelined ahead of a 30yr JGB auction later.</p>",
