The desk is also monitoring how the virus will impact the flow of trade through major shipping routes (see below). The data slate didn’t inspire any great confidence, particularly the Chicago Fed, which printed beneath all expectations, although analysts do cite some idiosyncratic factors why it was not consistent with the better tone seen in other regional surveys (see below). Fed’s Clarida made an appearance in the afternoon, though stuck to the script. Equities were red (S&amp;P 500 flat for the year), though the NDX fared better after decent earnings from AMZN. Yields were lower across the Treasury curve, which bull-flattened; most of the action was in the front part of the curve. In FX, the USD saw downside on month-end rebalancing factors, with JPY and GBP notably benefiting. XAU added about 12 bucks. SPX -1.8% at 3225, NDX -1.6% at 8992, DJI -2.1% at 28,255.</p><p>Treasuries have rallied this week, with yields on 2s, 5s, 10s plunging by around 17bps, and 30s falling by around 13bps - crucially slipping sub-2.00% briefly on Friday, as fears over the impact of the Coronavirus persist. The shape of the curve is mixed on a weekly view, with 2s5s and 2s10s narrowing, the former inverting this week. 2s30s widened by around 4bps, as has 10s30s, while 5s30s is around 5bps wider. At settlement, 30s had managed to keep their head above 2.00%, but there is now fresh attention on the 10-year yield, which is within a whisker of the 1.50% handle. Meanwhile, the EFFR on Thursday rose to 1.60% following the Fed's hike to the IOER rate, helping to guide it towards the midpoint of the FFR's target range. Next week, bond traders will be focussing on the Treasuries quarterly refunding announcement, and in particular, details around the announced 20-year issuance. US T-note futures settled 11 ticks higher at 131-21.</p>",
