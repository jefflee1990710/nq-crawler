Chevron (CVX) announced it would not increase bid for Anadarko (APC), and will receive a USD 1bln cash termination fee, whilst also announcing it will boost share repurchases. Both Occidental (OXY) and Anadarko (APC) fell at the open. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) shares were red on news that Democrats, including AOC and Bernie Sanders, have proposed a bill that would limit credit card interest fees. Ford (F) shares were under pressure, amid the broader market sell off, despite the automaker announcing that it expected better results in 2019. Apple (AAPL) were among the worst performers in the NDX, as leaked third party designed iPhone cases added to speculation that the next iPhone would have three cameras in a triangular array. Bank of America (BAC) announced it was considering scrapping its first data payments partnership, but traded broadly inline with its sector. Kraft Heinz (KHC) announced its plans to sell off its Italy-based Plasmon food unit, could fetch EUR 700mln. FOX Corp (FOXA, FOX) traded higher after the broadcaster announced a new partnership with The Star Group (TSG) to create a new bookmaker, Fox Bet, whilst The Star Group will gain access to key Fox Sports trademarks. Mylan (MYL) shares were supported by unconfirmed rumours that Carlisle was considering raising the finance to make a bid for a 100% stake in the co. Tapestry (TPR) were the star performer in the SPX after the luxury fashion brand reported an earnings beat, and authorised a USD 1bln share repurchase scheme. It is also worth noting that Uber is to price after the market today, with the ride hailing firm aiming to price its shares at or below the midpoint of it USD 44-50 target. S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2871, NASDAQ-100 -0.46% at 7583, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.53% at 25828,</p><p>Major curve spreads are slightly wider at settlement, though yields are lower by 3-4bps across the curve. The complex caught a haven bid on Thursday trade, as trade anxiety and geopolitics dominated. In early trade the 3m/10-year curve inverted again for the first time since March, amid distinctly risk off trade, which saw China’s yuan temporarily climb above the psychological 6.85 mark. Oxford Economics noted that with the yield curve flirting with inversion once again, its own yield curve recession models pointed to the highest odds of a downturn in this cycle (47% chance of a recession in the next six months, it says), which is in contrast with recent economic data pointing to solid fundamentals, and supportive of an economic expansion; OxEco added that while it remains cautious about the medium-term, the near-term odds of recession were low. The buying of the Treasuries in recent days has seen a reassessment of Fed rate cut probabilities too: Money markets imply the chances of a Fed rate cut this year are around 60%, falling from around 50% a week ago. The trade and geopolitics distracted from the US 30-year supply, which saw a small 0.2bps tail (beneath recent averages); the breakdown was lacklustre: dealers takedown was slightly above recent averages, though it was the largest takedown at a 30s auction since November; direct participation fell slightly below recent averages, and was the smallest takedown since November; the indirect bid was slightly above recent averages, though didn’t conjure the same outcries as the 10s auction, which saw indirect participation fall sharply, which yesterday led to speculation that the Chinese were not participating in Treasury auctions amid escalating tensions. US T-notes (M9) futures were up 10 ticks at 124.02 by the close of electronic trade.</p>",

US President Trump remarked that it was still possible for the US and China to reach a deal this week, revealing contents of a letter from China President Xi, which stated 'let's work together to see if we can get something done'. Sentiment, which had been in the dumps in the lead up to Trump's remarks, quickly reversed, despite the President also noting that he had begun work on the paperwork for raising tariffs. There was some push-back from China talking heads: Hu Xijin, editor of China's Global Times, tweeted that even if a trade deal is reached, it will be limited in actual meaning, and could be \"broken constantly\", and he said none of his sources involved in the trade talks see the prospect of a deal this week. The market now awaits the outcome from the meeting between China Vice Premier Liu He and the US negotiating team, on the slate for 17:00 EDT. However, with earlier reports suggesting that VP Liu He is no longer President Xi's \"special envoy,\" and therefore, it remains to be seen how much scope for compromise the Chinese will have.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Early reports from South Korea on Thursday suggested their Northern neighbour had fired unidentifiable missiles, which it believes were most probably two short-range missiles; if so, this would not be a violation of the NK-US agreement as it was not an ICBM. South Korean President Moon said that if these missile tests continued, it would endanger the success of talks. US President Trump later said that he is paying close attention to the situation, and no one is happy about it, adding that although North Korea wants to negotiate, he does not believe they are ready. Alongside the missile tests, North Korea faced more US pressure after one of its shipping vessels had reportedly been seized by the US; the WaPo cited the seizure being a result of international sanction violations. The vessel was said to be exporting North Korean coal, an export which the UN Security Council banned in 2017. On the Iran front, following Trump signing an executive order for imposing sanctions on Iranian metals, the Middle East nation's Foreign Minister said that the US sanctions are \"against international norms\" and Washington is responsible for the losses incurred by Iran. The Foreign Ministry also attempted to thwart US efforts saying that the EU should abide by the Iran nuclear deal and normalise economic ties with Iran; this came after comments from the EU that it wanted to preserve the nuclear deal but would not respond to \"ultimatums\" which Iran was proposing.</p><p><strong>* US TRADE DATA: </strong>The US trade deficit widened to USD 50bln in March (exp. 50.2bln, prev. rev up to 49.3bln); the trade deficit with China narrowed to 20.75bln in the month, from 24.76bln in February. The data represents the 'quiet before the storm', Capital Economics says, \"close to one-quarter of the USD 2.2bln increase in exports was due to a USD 0.5bln increase in soybean exports, which is at risk of being reversed in the coming months if the US-China trade talks collapse,\" the consultancy says, \"the USD 2.6bln increase in imports was predominantly due to a USD 1.4bln price-related surge in crude oil imports, although the unwinding of the weather-related disruption to the Canadian rail network also played a role.\" CapEco also notes that both exports and imports were very slightly higher than the BEA assumed in its initial estimate of first-quarter GDP, which CapEco says means that net trade contribution will likely remain close to 1% point. \"For the second quarter, we have both real export and import growth tracking at around 4% annualised, meaning that the contribution to GDP growth will be close to neutral.\"</p><p><strong>* US WHOLSALE SALES/INVENTORIES: </strong>Wholesale inventories fell 0.1% M/M in March, wholesale sales however rose by 2.3% M/M (exp. 0.2%). The data suggests a larger boost from inventories in the Q1, Goldman Sachs says, and it raised Q1 GDP tracking estimate one tenth to +3.1%, and Q2 GDP tracking estimate left unchanged at +1.9% (qoq ar).</p><p><strong>* US PPI: </strong>rose 0.2% M/M in April, core rose 0.1% M/M - both missed expectations by 0.1ppts. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that \"all the undershoot in the core against consensus due to a 0.5% drop in the hyper-volatile trade services component, which measures wholesale and retail margins.\" Core PPI ex trade services rose at the largest rate since October 2017, but comes on the back of recent sub-trend prints. Core PPI for goods slowed after the sharp downshift in the Chinese PPI for manufactured goods, but Pantheon sees little further downside risk. \"Core PPI services PPI ex-trade services has slowed too, with the Y/Y rate dipping to 2.1% in April, from a peak of 3.2% last fall,\" adding that \"this is hard to explain in the context of rising wage growth, and we’d be surprised by any further downshift.\" Pantheon also points out that PPI reports big rebounds in fees for portfolio management services (+5.2%) and mutual fund charges (+4.7%). \"Sharp declines in these components depressed the core PCE deflator in Q1, but now look set to reverse.\"</p><p><strong>* US INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>228k (exp. 220k, prev. 230k). Pantheon noted that claims have been elevated of late, after a run of downside surprises. \"This is probably of no macro significance, but if claims don't slide over the next few weeks it would be consistent with the idea that the labour market is coming off the boil,\" the consultancy said, adding that with GDP growth likely to average more than 2% this year, a serious sustained rise in claims is not in the cards.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Bostic, when prompted to comment on the US’s escalating trade friction with China, said businesses were telling him that raising tariffs to 25% will lead to price increases. On the domestic economy, he was more upbeat, saying that unemployment is at a historic low and that natural unemployment rate may actually be lower than estimates whilst also insisting that he has not seen signs of the economy over heating and he thinks we are almost at a point where he thinks inflation will start to move.</p><p><strong>* NORGES BANK REVIEW: </strong>Rates were kept unchanged at 1.00%, though the bank kept its hawkish stance, reaffirming that it is in tightening mode, which saw some upside in the NOK in wake of the decision. Capital Economics said the central bank's stance was justified given the economy is growing solidly, underpinned by a rise in oil investment, while core inflation is above target (Norway is the only G10 nation where inflation has risen over the past year). \"All told, we think that policymakers will resume their tightening cycle at their next meeting [20th June], and we have pencilled in another 25bp hike in Q4,\" Capital Economics writes; the consultancy expects the focus of traders to shift towards the widening interest rate differential with the Eurozone over the rest of this year, and sees EURNOK falling to 9.40 by end-2019 (from around 9.80 currently). \"However, if our forecast for the price of oil to fall to USD 60/bbl by the end of the year proves accurate, economic growth in Norway is likely to slow in 2020, and as a result, we think that the tightening cycle will come to an end sooner than investors think and that interest rates will stay on hold next year,\" CapEco says, \"this would probably limit any further upside for the currency next year.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.42 LOWER AT USD 61.70/BBL; BRENT (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.02 HIGHER AT USD 70.39/BBL</strong>. Oil traded choppy on Thursday, shrugging-off inventory draws in the week, with the market tepid ahead of Chinese officials holding talks with their US counterparts in Washington. PVM’s analysts note that market participants are \"keeping their power dry ahead of crunch talks.\" UBS believes that supply is still the primary risk for crude markets: \"OPEC has demonstrated the will and the ability to manage supply down to support oil prices at a reasonable level, and it continues to indicate a preference for higher prices,\" further summarising that \"oil investors seem more focused on downside risks to the oil price at the moment after a good run year-to-date, but markets should remain tight, providing good fundamental support for oil prices around the current level.\" In other supply news flow, Libya is targeting oil output of 1.4mln BPD by end-2019 (end-April production was 1.15mln BPD); Russian oil quality from the Ust-Luga port is reportedly still not good enough for European refiners, with standards likely to be met around May 11th.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 2871, NASDAQ-100 -0.46% at 7583, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.53% at 25828, SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary -0.43%, Consumer Staples -0.22%, Energy 0.07%, Financials -0.14%, Health Care -0.21%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology -0.68%, Materials -0.81%, Telecommunication Services -0.18%, Utilities -0.09%</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Intel (INTC) shares continued to sink after revising down guidance on Wednesday. Chevron (CVX) announced it would not increase bid for Anadarko (APC), and will receive a USD 1bln cash termination fee, whilst also announcing it will boost share repurchases. Both Occidental (OXY) and Anadarko (APC) fell at the open. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) shares were red on news that Democrats, including AOC and Bernie Sanders, have proposed a bill that would limit credit card interest fees. Ford (F) shares were under pressure, amid the broader market sell off, despite the automaker announcing that it expected better results in 2019. Apple (AAPL) were among the worst performers in the NDX, as leaked third party designed iPhone cases added to speculation that the next iPhone would have three cameras in a triangular array. Bank of America (BAC) announced it was considering scrapping its first data payments partnership, but traded broadly inline with its sector. Kraft Heinz (KHC) announced its plans to sell off its Italy-based Plasmon food unit, could fetch EUR 700mln. FOX Corp (FOXA, FOX) traded higher after the broadcaster announced a new partnership with The Star Group (TSG) to create a new bookmaker, Fox Bet, whilst The Star Group will gain access to key Fox Sports trademarks. Mylan (MYL) shares were supported by unconfirmed rumours that Carlisle was considering raising the finance to make a bid for a 100% stake in the co. Tapestry (TPR) were the star performer in the SPX after the luxury fashion brand reported an earnings beat, and authorised a USD 1bln share repurchase scheme. It is also worth noting that Uber is to price after the market today, with the ride hailing firm aiming to price its shares at or below the midpoint of it USD 44-50 target.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (M9) FUTURES SETTLE TICKS LOWER AT: </strong>Major curve spreads are slightly wider at settlement, though yields are lower by 3-4bps across the curve. The complex caught a haven bid on Thursday trade, as trade anxiety and geopolitics dominated. In early trade the 3m/10-year curve inverted again for the first time since March, amid distinctly risk off trade, which saw China’s yuan temporarily climb above the psychological 6.85 mark. Oxford Economics noted that with the yield curve flirting with inversion once again, its own yield curve recession models pointed to the highest odds of a downturn in this cycle (47% chance of a recession in the next six months, it says), which is in contrast with recent economic data pointing to solid fundamentals, and supportive of an economic expansion; OxEco added that while it remains cautious about the medium-term, the near-term odds of recession were low. The buying of the Treasuries in recent days has seen a reassessment of Fed rate cut probabilities too: Money markets imply the chances of a Fed rate cut this year are around 60%, falling from around 50% a week ago. The trade and geopolitics distracted from the US 30-year supply, which saw a small 0.2bps tail (beneath recent averages); the breakdown was lacklustre: dealers takedown was slightly above recent averages, though it was the largest takedown at a 30s auction since November; direct participation fell slightly below recent averages, and was the smallest takedown since November; the indirect bid was slightly above recent averages, though didn’t conjure the same outcries as the 10s auction, which saw indirect participation fall sharply, which yesterday led to speculation that the Chinese were not participating in Treasury auctions amid escalating tensions.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD;</strong> DXY was a function of trade sentiment and geopolitics, initially meandering around neutral until US players came in and sold the USD on risks of a breakdown in trade talks between the US and China (see USD section below). <strong>CNH; </strong>At one point, USDCNH broke above the psychological 6.85 level, a move which also weighed on the <strong>CAD</strong>, which has high-beta to CNY (though USDCAD upside action was capped by offers above 1.35, as well as the crude price falls and a widening of the trade deficit). However, in wake of more upbeat comments from US President Trump, much of the CNH’s depreciation vs USD was reversed. <strong>AUD/NZD</strong>, given proximity to China, suffered in the early hours, with some desks also expressing scepticism about the RBA’s rosy view of a rebound later this year. The pair did however, catch a bid in wake of the US Presidents comments regarding trade, with the 0.7000 handle proving again to be a magnet to the Aussie post RBA. Havens (<strong>JPY, CHF, XAU</strong>, as well as Treasuries) gained on the risk aversion. Action in <strong>EUR</strong> was particularly interesting, breaking out of the weekly range to the upside, seeing highs around 1.1250, with haven properties appealing, while also benefiting from the EMFX hit. <strong>GBP </strong>was a beneficiary of the broadly weaker dollar, amid a distinct lack of Brexit related commentary (though desks noted that Brexit and the data dump due Friday were limiting action on the upside).</p><p><strong>* CNY, CNH: </strong>Analysts note that the April total social financing data surprised to the downside, as it did in March. UBS thinks the Chinese government has become less dovish after March data releases, citing commentary from both the Politburo and the PBOC. With that said, UBS does not think that Beijing will be stepping hard on the brake at the moment (but says it might even roll out a fresh round of economic stimulus) since it is widely understood that the rebound in Q1 economic data has been very much policy driven and now the growth concerns resurface amid the escalation of the trade war with the US. From an FX perspective, UBS notes that “the incremental flow of credit is also much below the threshold as the bare minimum for Asian FX,” arguing that Asia needs monthly credit flow of around 2100bln yuan for Asian FX to stay afloat, and the bank says that a number like this, if sustained for 3 months, is worth between 2.0 to 2.5% weakness in Asian FX. Other desks have also warned that yuan stability had recently been providing a stable anchor for Asia FX (until last week); SocGen warns that “if that anchor gets dislodged further, CNY will lead the Asia FX cycle weaker” and going further, raising risks that the USD and the JPY could also head higher; if the CNY were to break 7.00, it could lead to EURUSD sub-1.11, while non-Asia FX like TRY, ZAR, ARS might also be hit, but it is also worth watching CAD, KRW and IDR, who also have a high beta to the CNY.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> Commerzbank mulls the impact boosting tariffs would have on the USD. Theoretically, it would have a positive impact on the dollar, via inflation dynamics. However, the bank complains that the economic understanding of inflation developments leave a lot to be desired, in recent years, and as a result, markets might be more focussed on the negative impact of the tariffs, which could raise the likelihood that the FOMC might cut rates in the months/quarters ahead, which could end up being USD-negative. “As however, the US currency suffered little or not at all as a result of the strong downside correction of US rate expectations over the past months, it is quite possible that the USD weakness will be less pronounced than one should expect,” Commerz says, warning that “however, that would mean that even further depreciation potential builds up which will then have to be realised in one fell swoop at a later stage.”</p>",

The trade and geopolitics distracted from the US 30-year supply, which saw a small 0.2bps tail (beneath recent averages); the breakdown was lacklustre: dealers takedown was slightly above recent averages, though it was the largest takedown at a 30s auction since November; direct participation fell slightly below recent averages, and was the smallest takedown since November; the indirect bid was slightly above recent averages, though didn’t conjure the same outcries as the 10s auction, which saw indirect participation fall sharply, which yesterday led to speculation that the Chinese were not participating in Treasury auctions amid escalating tensions.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>FX WRAP: USD; </strong>DXY<strong> </strong>was a function of trade sentiment and geopolitics, initially meandering around neutral until US players came in and sold the buck on risks of a breakdown in trade talks between the US and China (see USD section below). <strong>CNH; </strong>At one point, USDCNH broke above the psychological 6.85 level, which also weighed on the <strong>CAD</strong> (has high-beta to CNY, though USDCAD upside action was capped by offers above 1.35, as well as the crude price falls and a widening of the trade deficit). However, in wake of more upbeat comments from US President Trump, much of the CNH’s slide against the USD was pared. <strong>AUD </strong>and<strong> NZD</strong>, given proximity to China, suffered in the early hours, with some desks also expressing scepticism about the RBA’s rosy view of a rebound later this year; the pair did however, catch a bid in wake of the US President’s comments regarding trade, with the 0.7000 handle again proving to be a magnet for the <strong>AUD</strong> post RBA. Havens (<strong>JPY, CHF, XAU</strong>, as well as Treasuries) gained on the risk aversion. Action in <strong>EUR</strong> was particularly interesting, breaking out of the weekly range to the upside, seeing highs around 1.1250, with haven properties appealing, while also benefiting from the EMFX hit. <strong>GBP </strong>was a beneficiary of the broadly weaker dollar, amid a distinct lack of Brexit related commentary (though desks noted that Brexit and the data dump due Friday were limiting action on the upside).</p><p><strong>CNY, CNH:</strong> Analysts note that the April total social financing data surprised to the downside, as it did in March. UBS thinks the Chinese government has become less dovish after March data releases, citing commentary from both the Politburo and the PBOC. With that said, UBS does not think that Beijing will be stepping hard on the brake at the moment (but says it might even roll out a fresh round of economic stimulus) since it is widely understood that the rebound in Q1 economic data has been very much policy driven and now the growth concerns resurface amid the escalation of the trade war with the US. From an FX perspective, UBS notes that “the incremental flow of credit is also much below the threshold as the bare minimum for Asian FX,” arguing that Asia needs monthly credit flow of around 2100bln yuan for Asian FX to stay afloat, and the bank says that a number like this, if sustained for 3 months, is worth between 2.0 to 2.5% weakness in Asian FX. Other desks have also warned that yuan stability had recently been providing a stable anchor for Asia FX (until last week); SocGen warns that “if that anchor gets dislodged further, CNY will lead the Asia FX cycle weaker” and going further, raising risks that the USD and the JPY could also head higher; if the CNY were to break 7.00, it could lead to EURUSD sub-1.11, while non-Asia FX like TRY, ZAR, ARS might also be hit, but it is also worth watching CAD, KRW and IDR, who also have a high beta to the CNY.</p><p><strong>USD:</strong> Commerzbank mulls the impact boosting tariffs would have on the USD. Theoretically, it would have a positive impact on the dollar, via inflation dynamics. However, the bank complains that the economic understanding of inflation developments leave a lot to be desired, in recent years, and as a result, markets might be more focussed on the negative impact of the tariffs, which could raise the likelihood that the FOMC might cut rates in the months/quarters ahead, which could end up being USD-negative. “As however, the US currency suffered little or not at all as a result of the strong downside correction of US rate expectations over the past months, it is quite possible that the USD weakness will be less pronounced than one should expect,” Commerz says, warning that “however, that would mean that even further depreciation potential builds up which will then have to be realised in one fell swoop at a later stage.”</p>",

The fed will allow USD 9.9bln to run off its balance sheet at month-end and will add a decent USD 12.9bln to 3s USD 9.2bln to 10s and USD 6.5bln to 30s.</li><li>30-YEAR AUCTION: The last two 30yr auctions tailed modestly and averages point to a 0.4bp tail with 72% buy side reward (60% to directs and 12% to indirects), according to TD Securities. The most recent 30yr auction gave the lowest stop since January 2018, dealer took 27% whilst foreigners took 8% of the offered amount. SocGen notes that on a relative-value basis for the current auction calendar, “the 30y seems to have richened recently in the asset swap curve versus the previous auction cycles” whilst the 5s30s have flattened following the recent FOMC meeting. The overall sector also looks to be rich on the asset swap vs. the prior 30s auction cycles. SocGen holds a neutral/slightly negative outlook for the upcoming 30yr auction as the analysts keep in mind that the prior auction tailing and the current WI yield trading view all 30yr auction stops since January last year.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/82725e36-545b-4dc7-8174-370c08a41291.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar has lost momentum in wake of softer than expected US data in the form of jobless claims and PPI, with the index retreating further from earlier session highs of 97.702 through 97.500 and the 30 DMA (97.398) to a fresh 97.230 intraday low. Consequently, safer havens are extending their outperformance vs the Buck and the Euro has rebounded sharply amidst a flurry of tech buying, short stops and perhaps some switching out of EMs and/or hedging against a more pronounced run on riskier currencies.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>As noted above, the traditional safe-haven Franc and Yen have seen further upside in the run up to US-China trade talks as sabre-rattling between the 2 sides exacerbates investor angst over the failure to resolve the latest impasse and potential increased tariffs on a wider range of goods that Beijing has stated will prompt a retaliatory response. Usd/Chf has now declined through 1.0150 towards 1.0125, while Usd/Jpy is testing 109.50 and the base of a 1.3 bn option expiry band from 109.60 ahead of a Fib at 109.23. Meanwhile, the aforementioned combination of bullish factors/impulses have sparked an abrupt and impressive turnaround in the single currency’s fortunes from circa 1.1175 at one stage to 1.1250 and above the 30 DMA that bodes well from a chart perspective.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP</strong></p><p>Also benefiting from the Greenback’s post-data demise, as the Kiwi clawed back more RBNZ rate cut inspired losses to 0.6590 and unwound underperformance vs the <strong>AUD </strong>via the cross (sub-1.0590) given the Aussie’s greater correlation to China and inability to rebound far from multi-month lows vs its US counterpart. Conversely, Cable managed to reclaim 1.3000+ status after finding support ahead of the 200 DMA (1.2960) and briefly breaching a Fib (1.2980) and is now eyeing the 100 DMA (1.3013), but lagging most peers of persisting Brexit and UK political uncertainty.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/CAD</strong></p><p>The Krona was unable to evade the negative forces of risk-off trade and positioning, but held up better than its Scandi peer with the aid of Norges Bank policy guidance effectively preannouncing that rates will rise another 25 bp in June. Indeed, Eur/Nok was capped around 9.8600 vs Eur/Sek almost reaching 10.8400. Elsewhere, weak crude prices hardly helped the Loonie (or Nok and Rub for that matter), but Usd/Cad tested offer above 1.3500 after Canadian trade data revealed a larger than forecast deficit.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another bad day for regional currencies, as Usd/Cnh advanced further and breached its 200 DMA (6.8260) on the way to 6.8600+ and a brief appearance above Fib resistance, while Usd/Try topped 6.2450 after Turkish foreign reserves fell again and the CBRT attempted to arrest the Lira rout with another halt to 1 week repos.</p>",

There was also some sabre rattling from US President Trump who alleged that China broke the deal in trade talks and warned to not backdown until China stops cheating US workers, otherwise the US will not do business with them. Furthermore, overnight data releases were mixed in which Chinese CPI printed inline and PPI topped forecasts, although lending data disappointed with both New Yuan Loans and Aggregate Financing below expectations. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially saw mild upside on the risk averse tone and with the BoJ present in the market focused in the belly. However, the gains were later pared amid mixed comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who reiterated to continue with powerful monetary easing under YCC given that inflation is still below target, but noted that JGB purchases are slowing and suggested that even if BoJ bond purchases slow to JPY 30tln annually, it would not cause huge trouble.</p><p><strong>US President Trump stated that China broke the deal in trade talks and that China looted US for years</strong>, while he added that whatever happens in trade talks happens and suggested not to worry about it.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>European bourses have succumbed to the risk aversion [Eurostoxx 50 -1.0%]</strong> seen in Asia and Wall Street, with the downbeat tone exacerbated by reports of further missiles tests in North Korea. Sectors are largely lower with the exception of defensive sectors such as Utilities (Unch) and Consumer Staples (+0.2%). A few themes are in play today; 1) a guidance cut by Intel yesterday has prompted a sell-off in European chip names with Infineon (-2.8%) and STMicroelectronics (-2.8%) shares plumbing the depths, albeit Dialog Semiconductor (+0.2%) is bucking the trend on the back of optimistic earnings. 2) Mining names bear the brunt of sentiment-subdued base metal prices coupled with ArcelorMittal’s (-3.9%) 33% drop in profits, thus Rio Tinto (-0.9%), Antofagasta (-1.3%) and Glencore (-1.8%) all weigh on the sector. 3) Against the backdrop of weaker auto earnings, Continental (-3.2%) also reported dismal numbers which dragged its peers Michelin (-0.9%) and Pirelli (-1.2%) lower in sympathy. Finally, Renault (-2.0%) shares declined amid press reports that Nissan could lower its 2022 guidance. Back to earnings, some analysis from JPM notes that thus far, 55% of the Stoxx 600 companies topped EPS estimates (vs. 76% in the S&amp;P 500) whilst 58% of firms are beating on topline with sales growth at 1% Y/Y (vs. +5% Y/Y in the S&amp;P 500), “This is consistent with our view that sales growth in Europe would underwhelm relative to the US, given the weaker macro momentum in the region” JPM says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>JPY/CHF - Demand for the Yen remains fervent and the Franc is also back in favour as tensions rise ahead of the US/China face-off in Washington, while geopolitical factors are also weighing on sentiment given the US-EU-Iran sanctions dispute and NK firing an unidentified projectile. Hence, Usd/Jpy has retreated a bit further from 110.00+ to fill/trip a few stops between 109.75-70 and test the top end of decent option expiry interest spanning 109.60-50, while Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf have pulled back from 1.0200+ and 1.1400 respectively.</p><p>USD - Notwithstanding the greater appeal for safer-havens noted above, the Dollar retains a firm underlying bid vs the other G10s and especially EMs that are suffering in their own right. Indeed, the DXY continues to find support below 97.500 and its 30 DMA (97.398) with the index currently hovering in a 97.702-517 range.</p><p>AUD - The major underperformer and most prone to the threat of a complete breakdown in US-China trade dialogue that would trigger an exchange of more aggressive tit-for-tat tariffs. Aud/Usd has recoiled from recent recovery highs towards this week’s multi-month low around 0.6963 and Aud/NZD has unwound more post-RBNZ spike gains to sub-1.0600 as Nzd/Usd holds more comfortably above 0.6550 and depths plunged in wake of Wednesday’s NZ rate cut. On that note, Governor Orr has reiterated that the policy outlook is now more neutral and it is too soon to assess if more easing is required ahead of testimony on the latest meeting and action to a parliamentary select committee.</p><p>NOK - Staying with the Central Bank theme, but in stark contrast to the RBNZ, Norway’s Norges Bank flagged a hike at next month’s meeting and the Nok shot up across the board in response. However, gains were rapidly eroded and reversed at one stage amidst the aforementioned risk-averse tone before the Norwegian Crown regained bullish momentum on the fact that rates are set to rise against the general global grain of steady to easier policy. Eur/Nok is back under 9.8000, albeit just within 9.7784-8393 trading parameters and eyeing hefty expiry interest (1.1 bn) at the strike.</p><p>EUR/GBP/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but with a bearish bias below 1.1200, 1.3000 and only just over 1.3500 respectively. Eur/Usd has multi-bn expiries stretching from 1.1150 to 1.1200 and beyond to keep price movement contained along with the 30 DMA (1.1223) and interim chart support at 1.1155, while Cable has gleaned some traction around a Fib (1.2980) and ahead of the 200 DMA (1.2960), but needs to recapture the 100 DMA (1.3013) to revisit best levels of 1.3025. Back to the Loonie, Canadian trade data looms alongside house prices.</p><p>EM - More widespread losses vs the Usd, but once again the Try is underperforming and has been down to through 6.2450 with the Lira lamenting another decline in Turkish foreign reserves.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>It remains to be seen whether this is just another bout of consolidation and chance for bulls to refuel, but in keeping with the pattern seen yesterday Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries have eased back from best levels ahead of the US open. For UK debt, supply may be an issue given a so-so DMO auction vs more solid Spanish sales, as the 10 year benchmark slips through 128.00 from 128.19, with Bunds down to 128.35 vs 166.53 and US Treasuries hovering just above 124-00 against 124-03 and Wednesday’s 124-06 high. Ahead, top-tier US data and the final leg of this week’s refunding via Usd19 bn long bonds after a somewhat disappointing 10 year offering last night.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Brent (-0.5%) and WTI (-0.4%) prices are choppy, with prices initially subdued amid the general risk sentiment as markets await US-China updates and the most recent geopolitical developments being reports that North Korea has fired an unidentified projectile at 16:30 local time, although it is still unknown whether it was a single or multiple projectiles. Despite the recent price action being sentiment-driven, the macro picture still stands, with Iranian/Venezuelan sanctions, Libyan tensions and OPEC-led cuts still on the table. Thus, Barclays revised their Q3 2019 Brent and WTI forecasts higher by USD 4/bbl amid expectations of tightening market conditions. In terms of US supply, ING highlights that refinery run rate remain at a season-low at 88.9% last week amid a heavier maintenance season alongside several unplanned outages. Meanwhile, gold (+0.3%) has been accumulating some risk premium in light of the aforementioned developments in the Korean peninsula whilst conversely, copper is pressured by the humdrum risk tone emanating from the seemingly escalating US-Sino tensions and geopolitical concerns. Finally, China State Planner stated that strict pollution related controls will be imposed on steel-making capacity in key pollution area whilst also raising domestic iron ore production. It’s worth noting that earlier in March, a level 1 smog alert was issued which requires steel mills to curb production by 40-70%. Although, it is worth assuming that iron ore production will be hiked to offset volatility in the base metal.</p><p>China's State Planner state they will impose strict controls on steel-making capacity in key pollution areas.

Eur/Usd has multi-bn expiries stretching from 1.1150 to 1.1200 and beyond to keep price movement contained along with the 30 DMA (1.1223) and interim chart support at 1.1155, while Cable has gleaned some traction around a Fib (1.2980) and ahead of the 200 DMA (1.2960), but needs to recapture the 100 DMA (1.3013) to revisit best levels of 1.3025. Back to the Loonie, Canadian trade data looms alongside house prices.</p><p>EM - More widespread losses vs the Usd, but once again the Try is underperforming and has been down to through 6.2450 with the Lira lamenting another decline in Turkish foreign reserves.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It remains to be seen whether this is just another bout of consolidation and chance for bulls to refuel, but in keeping with the pattern seen yesterday Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries have eased back from best levels ahead of the US open. For UK debt, supply may be an issue given a so-so DMO auction vs more solid Spanish sales, as the 10 year benchmark slips through 128.00 from 128.19, with Bunds down to 128.35 vs 166.53 and US Treasuries hovering just above 124-00 against 124-03 and Wednesday’s 124-06 high. Ahead, top-tier US data and the final leg of this week’s refunding via Usd19 bn long bonds after a somewhat disappointing 10 year offering last night.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Brent (Unch) and WTI (-0.4%) prices are choppy, with prices initially subdued amid the general risk sentiment as markets await US-China updates and the most recent geopolitical developments being reports that North Korea has fired an unidentified projectile at 16:30 local time, although it is still unknown whether it was a single or multiple projectiles. Despite the recent price action being sentiment-driven, the macro picture still stands, with Iranian/Venezuelan sanctions, Libyan tensions and OPEC-led cuts still on the table. Thus, Barclays revised their Q3 2019 Brent and WTI forecasts higher by USD 4/bbl amid expectations of tightening market conditions. In terms of US supply, ING highlights that refinery run rate remain at a season-low at 88.9% last week amid a heavier maintenance season alongside several unplanned outages. Meanwhile, gold (+0.3%) has been accumulating some risk premium in light of the aforementioned developments in the Korean peninsula whilst conversely, copper is pressured by the humdrum risk tone emanating from the seemingly escalating US-Sino tensions and geopolitical concerns. Finally, China State Planner stated that strict pollution related controls will be imposed on steel-making capacity in key pollution area whilst also raising domestic iron ore production. It’s worth noting that earlier in March, a level 1 smog alert was issued which requires steel mills to curb production by 40-70%. Although, it is worth assuming that iron ore production will be hiked to offset volatility in the base metal.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Demand for the Yen remains fervent and the Franc is also back in favour as tensions rise ahead of the US/China face-off in Washington, while geopolitical factors are also weighing on sentiment given the US-EU-Iran sanctions dispute and NK firing an unidentified projectile. Hence, Usd/Jpy has retreated a bit further from 110.00+ to fill/trip a few stops between 109.75-70 and test the top end of decent option expiry interest spanning 109.60-50, while Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf have pulled back from 1.0200+ and 1.1400 respectively.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the greater appeal for safer-havens noted above, the Dollar retains a firm underlying bid vs the other G10s and especially EMs that are suffering in their own right. Indeed, the DXY continues to find support below 97.500 and its 30 DMA (97.398) with the index currently hovering in a 97.702-517 range.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The major underperformer and most prone to the threat of a complete breakdown in US-China trade dialogue that would trigger an exchange of more aggressive tit-for-tat tariffs. Aud/Usd has recoiled from recent recovery highs towards this week’s multi-month low around 0.6963 and Aud/<strong>NZD </strong>has unwound more post-RBNZ spike gains to sub-1.0600 as Nzd/Usd holds more comfortably above 0.6550 and depths plunged in wake of Wednesday’s NZ rate cut. On that note, Governor Orr has reiterated that the policy outlook is now more neutral and it is too soon to assess if more easing is required ahead of testimony on the latest meeting and action to a parliamentary select committee.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>Staying with the Central Bank theme, but in stark contrast to the RBNZ, Norway’s Norges Bank flagged a hike at next month’s meeting and the Nok shot up across the board in response. However, gains were rapidly eroded and reversed at one stage amidst the aforementioned risk-averse tone before the Norwegian Crown regained bullish momentum on the fact that rates are set to rise against the general global grain of steady to easier policy. Eur/Nok is back under 9.8000, albeit just within 9.7784-8393 trading parameters and eyeing hefty expiry interest (1.1 bn) at the strike.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but with a bearish bias below 1.1200, 1.3000 and only just over 1.3500 respectively. Eur/Usd has multi-bn expiries stretching from 1.1150 to 1.1200 and beyond to keep price movement contained along with the 30 DMA (1.1223) and interim chart support at 1.1155, while Cable has gleaned some traction around a Fib (1.2980) and ahead of the 200 DMA (1.2960), but needs to recapture the 100 DMA (1.3013) to revisit best levels of 1.3025. Back to the Loonie, Canadian trade data looms alongside house prices.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>More widespread losses vs the Usd, but once again the Try is underperforming and has been down to through 6.2450 with the Lira lamenting another decline in Turkish foreign reserves.</p>",

Bunds are also deriving underlying support from weakness in the Eurozone periphery as BTPs continue to fret about Italy’s finances and Bonos make room for upcoming multi-tranche issuance. From a technical standpoint, Wednesday’s 166.47 session peak is the natural nearest upside target vs support around 166.00 and just below the round number.</p>",

Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.3%) was the exception due to corporate updates. Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) was weighed by currency effects and with individual stocks driven by a plethora of earnings releases, while Hang Seng (-2.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) were the worst hit on trade concerns after the US issued a notice confirming that tariffs will be increased on Friday and with China’s Mofcom mulling counter measures.

The complex started out the day on the front foot, underpinned by trade anxiety. And while punchy trade rhetoric and geopolitical developments kept a floor under prices, there was downside in wake of a weak 10-year auction, where the US sold 10-year paper in a very soft auction, which saw the largest tail since August 2017, and the lowest cover ratio since March 2008; indirects performance was also the weakest since April 2018, giving rise to the usual (unverified) rumours that China was staying on the sidelines as trade tensions gain prominence; a Jeffries analyst also suggested that the auction may have been soft due to the 10s complex coming so far so quickly suggesting there may be limited upside. A heavy slate of corporate supply was also cited as a reason for the TPLEX weakness. The US will on Thursday sell 30s, completing the week's supply; SocGen holds a neutral/slightly negative outlook for the upcoming 30y auction.

However, the gains were later pared amid mixed comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who reiterated to continue with powerful monetary easing under YCC given that inflation is still below target, but noted that JGB purchases are slowing and suggested that even if BoJ bond purchases slow to JPY 30tln annually, it would not cause huge trouble.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly negative as US-China trade uncertainty keeps global risk sentiment cautious ahead of the Chinese delegation visit to Washington D.C. and as the region also digests a heavy slate of corporate earnings. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.3%) is the exception due to corporate updates with Orica a notable gainer following a return to profit and with Qantas shares taking off on higher revenue, although the best performing sector is telecoms after the ACCC blocked the TPG-Vodafone Australia merger. Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) is weighed by currency effects and with individual stocks driven by a plethora of earnings releases, while Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) are negative on trade concerns after the US issued a notice confirming that tariffs will be increased on Friday. There was also some sabre rattling from US President Trump who alleged that China broke the deal in trade talks and warned to not backdown until China stops cheating US workers, otherwise the US will not do business with them. Furthermore, overnight data releases have been mixed as Chinese CPI printed inline and PPI topped forecasts, although lending data disappointed with both New Yuan Loans and Aggregate Financing missing expectations.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady and holds on to the prior day’s gains as the risk averse tone provides safe-haven support, while its major counterparts are lacklustre after EUR/USD slipped back below 1.1200 and with GBP/USD stuck near this week’s lows circa 1.3000 ahead of next week’s discussions with the executive of the 1922 committee regarding PM May’s future. Elsewhere, USD/JPY gave up 110.00 again and JPY-crosses extended on their declines due to the negative risk tone, which has also hampered high beta currencies as CAD eyes its weakest levels in around 2 weeks and with AUD/USD retreating further away from the 0.7000 handle, while Westpac was also bearish on the latter as it recommended to sell at 0.7085 levels with a target of 0.6960 and stop at 0.7120.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains on the risk averse tone and with the BoJ also present in the market, mainly focused in the belly.</p>",
