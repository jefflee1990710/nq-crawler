JPMorgan (JPM) opened lower on a downgrade from Keefe Bruyette, although pared losses amid some positive guidance made at the GS financials conference. SPX -0.15% at 3,131, Dow -0.13% at 27,877.03, NQX -0.1% at 8,354.</p><p>T-notes were in the ascendency, at the start of the day, with a bull-flattening bias, before a positive WSJ report on US/China trade saw sellers emerge; however, Treasuries pared losses, as other asset classes did as the report was digested. The US auction of 10-year notes was decent, stopping through the screens by 0.1bps, while cover was a touch firmer than recent averages. Indirect participation was a little softer than recent averages, and like the 3s auction on Monday, direct bidders' participation was firmer. The US will sell 30-year bonds ahead of the FOMC announcement. At settlement, yields were slightly higher on the day across the curve, though major curve spreads had still narrowed by 1-2bps. US T-note (H0) futures settled 1+ ticks lower at 128-29+.</p>",

Losses were sharply pared, however, after the WSJ reported that the US was likely to delay the implementation of the 15th December tariff hikes, which saw risk bounce; however, gains were hard to hold on to, as traders noted that the delay was a result of haggling over how much US ags China should buy - commentators were under the impression that this issue had been resolved already. Some initial downside was also seen after NEC Director Kudlow stated the US hasn’t yet agreed to delay new tariffs. ES generally traversed horizontally through the rest of the session, generally remaining in a 3,132.50-3,142.50 range.</p><p><strong>* FED PREVIEW:</strong> The FOMC is expected to leave rates unchanged at 1.50-1.75%. Attention will be on the forward guidance elements, updated forecasts and ‘dot plot’. In his press conference, Chair Powell may be asked to clarify what factors the Fed needs to be in place that would amount to a “material reassessment” of the outlook – both on the upside and downside – that may result in the FOMC changing its policy stance. Ultimately, Powell is expected to reiterate an optimistic view of the US economy, though caution on familiar risks while reiterating a data-dependent outlook (NOTE: the FOMC precedes a potential boosting of US tariffs on Chinese imports on 15th December). Rate decision will be published along with updated economic projections at 1900 GMT/1400 ET on 11th December 2019; the post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell will commence at 1930 GMT/1430 ET.

However, Perdue stated that while thinks the President does not want to implement these new tariffs, there had to be some movement on the Chinese side, to encourage Trump not to pursue tariffs; Perdue is hopeful that the Chinese buying of US soybeans may provide this. However, overnight an SCMP article downplayed the chances of reaching an imminent deal, stating that the US-China trade deal is not expected this week given that the US is occupied by the USMCA, though it did state that sources from Beijing and Washington continue to believe that tariffs planned for Sunday will be averted, due to economic pressure on both the US and China. With that said, analysts still note that China demands the US remove existing tariffs imposed on around USD 375bln worth of its exports to the US, and cancel the impending tariff hike on 15th December. On the other side, in addition to a commitment to buy specific amounts of US ags products, the US demands China make concessions on intellectual property rights, currency and access to China’s financial services sectors, which may be harder to achieve; these other factors may be kicked into the next phase of trade talks, which may keep trade uncertainty in the forefront of traders’ minds in 2020, heading into the November Presidential elections. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CHINA CPI:</strong> Chinese consumer prices rose +0.4% M/M in November (exp. +0.1%, prev +0.9%), and the Y/Y jumped to 4.5% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 3.8%). The CPI Y/Y rose to a seven year high as pork prices surged at a rate of +110% Y/Y. some desks note that, when stripping out the impact of food prices, core inflation was relatively weak at 1.4%, suggesting little need for optimism. Analysts suggest that the data offers policymakers more scope to ease policy, as producer prices contracted at a rate of -1.4% Y/Y (exp. -1.5%, prev. -1.6%), since the PPI contraction lessens concerns about CPI. Analysts will be eying remarks from top policymakers at the Central Economic Working Conference (CEWC), where economic targets for the year will be set (these, however, will not be publicly unveiled until March 2020); the conference will likely take place around the middle of this month.</p><p><strong>* US NFIB BUSINESS OPTIMISM:</strong> November’s data picked up to 104.7 from October’s print of 102.4. Seven of the ten components increased in November, with earnings trends performing well rising 10 points. The uncertainty index dropped 6 points this month, continuing from its 4 point decline in October, which Wells Fargo highlights could be a reflection of rising optimism of the USMCA agreement. The report also highlighted that the most important reason business owners want to expand is economic conditions, followed by sales prospects and finances. The employment reading was also strong, as job creation increased by an average of 0.29 workers per firm, the highest level since May. WFC noted “average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers have a fairly tight correlation with the share of businesses citing the quality of labour as their number one challenge”. On compensation, frequency of plans to increase it rose 4 points to the highest level since December 1989. However, Wells Fargo highlight the rise in compensation costs is resulting in more business trying to put the higher costs onto customers where, seasonally adjusted, the net percent of owners raising average selling prices rose 2 points to 12%. Whilst only 1% plan to cut selling prices, although 8% did report cuts, however 22% plan to increase prices over the next few months.</p><p><strong>* YOUGOV MRP POLL:</strong> At 2200 GMT, YouGov will publish its multi-level regression and poststratification model (MRP), which correctly predicted a hung parliament at the 2017 elections (it will be published on the Times website and on Sky News). In November, YouGov's model showed the conservatives 11 points ahead of Labour and forecast a 68-seat majority. Recent polling has put the Tories' lead at between 6-15 points; the gap has generally been between 7-15 points through the campaigning period, though ICM this week revealed a gap of just 6 in its polling. UK PM Johnson was on the weekend asked about whether he was concerned by the narrowing in some polls, and stated \"we are still not quite there yet and do not forget what happened in 2017. This is a close fought election\". Regarding opinion polling, analysts note that in 2017, opinion polls were published right up until the election day itself, and it therefore appears that polls can be published up until 2359 GMT on Wednesday; regulator OFCOM states that broadcasters may not, however, publish the results of any opinion poll on election day itself.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY ZEW:</strong> Current conditions rose by more than expected, to -19.9 (exp. -22.3, prev. -24.7); economic sentiment bounced back, printing +10.7 from a prior -2.1. The report was solid, Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"the key story here is that the expectations index is now positive and rising, even as the current situation index remains depressed,\" adding that \"usually, this is a bullish signal in this survey.\" The details of the report show that investor short-term rate expectations are now rising slightly, though the outlook for long-term rates has fallen. More importantly Pantheom suggests, expectations for equities soared, almost uniformly, across the board. \"Investor sentiment data are not always a reliable guide to the economic surveys, but the recent rebound in the ZEW and Sentix suggests that the recent tepid recovery in the manufacturing PMI will continue this month.\"</p><p><strong>* FRENCH PROTESTS:</strong> A sixth day of protests among public transport and education sectors; unions are reportedly seeking to apply maximum pressure on the French government ahead of pension reforms set to be presented by PM Philippe on Wednesday. Desks are looking to the protests to gauge the level of public support, and turnout of demonstrations will be judged against last Thursday's protests, where an estimated 800k people showed up - anything less may strengthen the government's hand, some say. The government has offered to allow a longer phasing-in period for the new reforms in an effort to appease demonstrators, and there are reports that the government may even delay the implementation, making the reforms applicable to only those born after 1975. If tensions were to de-escalate, analysts believe the chances of passing the reforms will be made easier, even if the government would provide some concessions. On the energy front, France's CGT union will decide next week whether it will go ahead with unlimited strikes at the country’s oil refineries.</p><p><strong>* NORGES BANK REGIONAL SURVEY:</strong> Norges Bank Q4 Regional Network Survey saw its aggregate output index 6-months ahead at 0.96 (Prev. 1.35), and the past 3-months index 1.06 (Prev. 1.48). The report stated that growth has slowed through the autumn, due to lower retail sales and postponements of transport development problems, and slowed in all sectors -- by the most in retail, trade, construction domestically orientated manufacturing, and domestically orientated oil services. A number of contacts describe the economic prospects as more uncertain than one year ago are concerned about contagion effects from global trade turbulence. Employment growth has been high over the past two years, but has slowed since spring. Contacts are also planning fewer new hires ahead. Weaker growth prospects are prompting a number of contacts to delay workforce expansion. The report adds to the evidence to other evidence that the momentum in the economic upturn is losing strength, SEB's analysts said. \"Developments over the past three months have been weaker than predicted, and expectations on future output growth was revised lower.\" SEB notes that the aggregated output indicator still points to healthy growth in mainland GDP, of around 0.5% Q/Q in coming quarters, though SEB points out that this is slower than the 0.7% Q/Q growth rate during Q2 and Q3. Hence, the report confirms the bank’s view that full-year growth will slow notably in 2020, SEB argues, while Job expectations were also revised lower and signal downside risks to Norges Bank’s forecast. Meanwhile, SEB noes that capacity constraints have stabilised, supporting the NB's view that the output gap is at the peak. With that said, the report states more contacts are now constrained by a shortage of labour. \"The labour market thus appears to have tightened slightly, which it at odds with the recent upturn in the LFS labour force,\" SEB writes, \"the overall message from the report confirms the broad contours outlined in the September MPR, though the slowdown appears to materialize somewhat earlier than expected,\" and SEB adds that \"it also suggests there is no need for further rate hikes and Norges Bank should reiterate that rates will remain on hold in 2020.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLES USD 0.22 HIGHER AT USD 59.24; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.09 HIGHER AT USD 64.34:</strong> Benchmarks were modestly supported on news that the US may delay December 15th China tariffs, in addition to the Street expecting inventory draws this week. A recent newswire poll has a consensus of USD 61 per barrel for Brent in 2020. More immediately, Citi’s analysts note that French protest strikes are becoming more acute with port operations affecting oil deliveries to refiners which could reduce demand and production of oil. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories, with the APIs on Tuesday evening ahead of the DoE release on Wednesday, crude stocks are seen drawing 2.8mln bbls, whilst the products are both seen building, distillates by 1.6mln bbls and gasoline by 2.5mln bbls; Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks drawing 2.3mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO:</strong> The EIA left its 2019 world oil demand growth unchanged at a 0.75mln BPD Y/Y increase, whilst it raised its 2020 forecast by 50k BPD to a 1.42mln BPD Y/Y rise. EIA expects US crude oil production to average 13.2mln BPD in 2020 (+0.9mln BPD vs 2019 levels). Says expected 2020 growth is slower than 2018 growth of 1.6mln BPD and 2019 growth of 1.3mln BPD. Forecasts OPEC crude oil production will average 29.3mln BPD in 2020 (down 0.5mln BPD vs 2019).</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.15% at 3,131, Dow -0.13% at 27,877.03, NQX -0.1% at 8,354; </strong>SECTORS: energy +0.16%, health care +0.14%, IT 0.0%, financials 0.0%, utilities -0.05%, industrials -0.17%, consumer discretionary -0.21%, communications -0.3%, consumer staples -0.35%, telecoms -0.36%, materials -0.58%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>AutoZone (AZO) was a top performer after an all forecast-beating quarter, supporting competitors such as Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY). Stitch Fix (SFIX) also surged on a strong quarter in addition to some management changes. Toll Brothers (TOL) traded in the red following disappointing profit margins. MongoDB (MDB) firmed on beating both top and bottom-line estimates, whilst exceeding street forecast for its guidance. HD Supply (HDS) traded lower on weak revenue and disappointing guidance. Chewy (CHWY) missed on its loss estimates but impressed on revenue guidance. Casey’s (CASY) tumbled on a revenue miss and SSS view cuts for some segments.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) dipped under USD 300/share amid a downgrade to Needham on revenue woes in an increasingly competitive landscape. Agilent Technologies (A) shares were the beneficiary of a 13-F filing from activist investor Bill Ackman. NortonLifeLock (NLOK) caught a bid after reports suggested there were several interested parties for buying it out, including McAfee. Fitbit (FIT) legged lower on reports the DoJ was looking into Google’s (GOOGL) proposed acquisition. Parker-Hannifin (PH), ITT (ITT) and Bunge (BG) were supported by upgrades at Goldman Sachs, which also downgraded International Paper (IP), McCormick (MKC) and Packaging Corp of America (PKG), weighing on those stocks. Peloton (PTON) accumulated losses on the release of a short thesis and USD 8 PT from Citron Research. Church &amp; Dwight (CHD) took a hit on a JPMorgan downgrade. L3Harris Technologies (LHX) was supported by an Outperform initiation at Bernstein. JPMorgan (JPM) opened lower on a downgrade from Keefe Bruyette, although pared losses amid some positive guidance made at the GS financials conference.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLE 1+ TICKS LOWER AT 128-29+. </strong>T-notes were in the ascendency, at the start of the day, with a bull-flattening bias, before a positive WSJ report on US/China trade saw sellers emerge; however, Treasuries pared losses, as other asset classes did as the report was digested. The US auction of 10-year notes was decent, stopping through the screens by 0.1bps, while cover was a touch firmer than recent averages. Indirect participation was a little softer than recent averages, and like the 3s auction on Monday, direct bidders' participation was firmer. The US will sell 30-year bonds ahead of the FOMC announcement. At settlement, yields were slightly higher on the day across the curve, though major curve spreads had still narrowed by 1-2bps.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The buck continued to pare back losses after Friday’s jobs report falling from 97.66 at highs to lows of 97.40 in continued cautious trade ahead of a key risk week where selling exacerbated at time of the US equity open.</p><p><strong>* CAD/MXN</strong>: A reduction in USCMA uncertainty this week has buoyed the Loonie and the Peso, and will be welcomed at BOC towers, which has been left embarrassed recently after offering a hawkish assessment of the economy and policy last week, which was followed by very weak labour market data, which desks have suggested will likely eventually play out into a rate cut scenario. MUFG says it leaves the CAD struggling for direction in the near-term, as USDCAD continues to trade in line with its average since the summer of around 1.3240. \"The negative impact on the Canadian dollar from the weakening Canadian data flow is being offset by the positive impact from USMCA trade deal optimism, less dovish BOC policy stance, and deeper OPEC+ production cuts,\" MUFG points out, £USDCAD would have to break out from its current trading range between 1.3150-1.3350 to trigger more excitement that the current consolidation phase is ending.\" The bank notes, however, that the current record low levels of USDCAD implied volatility are not portending a pick-up in volatility soon. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling traded firmer today; participants will be eyeing any changes within latest YouGov MRP model. In November, YouGov's model showed the conservatives 11 points ahead of Labour, and forecast a 68 seat majority. Recent polling has put the Tories' lead at between 6-15 points; the gap has generally been between 7-15 points through the campaigning period, though ICM this week revealed a gap of just 6 in its polling. Cable traded from lows of 1.3131 today to highs of 1.3251 amid this morning’s GDP data which printed saw Y/Y growth at 0.7%, a slower pace than the previous 0.9% in line with the street expectations. However, M/M saw no growth for the third month in a row, the longest since Q1 2009, the report also noted there were some signs of a stockpiling boost to imports and exports ahead of the Brexit deadline. Manufacturing output however ticked up to 0.2%, from a prior -0.4% reading. Gains in Sterling were however capped after source reports tonight’s poll will be “less happy” for the conservative party in comparison to the previous poll.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> EUR was higher against the buck after positive German ZEW print set the tone for the single currency as it trended higher throughout the session testing the 1.11 handle, a figure it hasn’t seen post Friday’s strong US jobs report. Past the psychological 1.11 handle technicians are eyeing 1.1109 as a key reversal point. Also of note, EZ long-term inflation expectations also rose to the highest in 1 month at 1.2428%, ahead of Lagarde’s first meeting on Thursday.</p><p><strong>* JPY, XAU, CHF: </strong>Havens traded relatively flat heading into the APAC session despite weakening slightly on source reports that the 15th December tariffs will be delayed. However, losses were short-lived as the details within the article suggested they are still haggling over agricultural purchases, and it also noted President Trump has not made a final decision, a view later echoed by NEC Director Kudlow who said there is no final decision.</p><p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Governor Lowe overnight did not touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook. However, AUDNZD was under pressure, which analysts attributed to higher than expected Chinese CPI data, helping NZD to outperform overnight. Desks note the improvement in Kiwi data of late (notably the Performance of Services and Manufacturing PMI), while the RBNZ surprised hawkishly at its latest policy meeting, holding rates against expectations it would cut -- and the positive comments from RBNZ dep gov Bascand have been taken as a sign that the positive run can continue; higher kiwi yields are also supporting the NZD. Additionally, optimism that US/China can reach a trade deal and the US avoiding implementing tariffs on 15th December are positive catalysts for the both the AUD and the NZD.</p><p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>ZAR was slammed yet again after continued load shedding which saw USDZAR print 14.86 at the highs, however, some support was seen towards the tail end of the session which saw load shedding fall back to stage 2 from highs of 6 yesterday, note analyst had noted that the higher level of load shedding, the more of a negative impact to GDP. Elsewhere, TRY &amp; BRL were relatively contained as participants await both the latest central bank decisions.</p>",

In November, YouGov's model showed the conservatives 11 points ahead of Labour, and forecast a 68 seat majority. Recent polling has put the Tories' lead at between 6-15 points; the gap has generally been between 7-15 points through the campaigning period, though ICM this week revealed a gap of just 6 in its polling. UK PM Johnson was on the weekend asked about whether he was concerned by the narrowing in some polls, and stated \"we are still not quite there yet and do not forget what happened in 2017. This is a close fought election\". Regarding opinion polling, analysts note that in 2017, opinion polls were published right up until the election day itself, and it therefore appears that polls can be published up until 2359 GMT on Wednesday; regulator OFCOM states that broadcasters may not, however, publish the results of any opinion poll on election day itself.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S AUCTIONS: </strong>The US Treasury will this week sell a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Mon), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Tue) and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Wed), for a total of USD 78bln. This week, there will be USD 26bln of cash via redemptions and coupon payments. BMO notes that this collateral will settle on Monday, December 16, and it sees parallels between these dynamics and those in the lead up to the repo volatility on September 16. \"The parallels between the two dates are striking: both are Monday’s with USD 54bln in new coupon supply, and large expected corporate tax payments.\" BMO also notes that in each of the last three years, the December corporate tax payment was larger than the September, though this need not necessarily be the case. \"Of course, the repo world is significantly different than just three months ago – with hundreds of billions of Fed injections having occurred over the intervening period,\" and net, BMO expects slight upward pressure on funding costs, but nothing close to what we saw around the last large corporate tax payment. \"Instead, attention rightfully should focus on the upcoming year-end funding squeeze.\"</p><p><strong>10-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>BMO's analysts note that the backup in rates seen over the past few sessions has brought 10-year yields back in line with last month’s auction stop. \"Given the strong demand seen then, we think outright valuations will be sufficient to bring in buyers.\" The 10-year sector has continued to cheapen on the curve, with 5/10/30 fly back to the highest levels since June, which BMO says should enhance the relative value appeal of 10s. In terms of the breakdown, the 18.5% allocation to foreign investors last month was the highest since November 2018, and was in contrast to what had been a steady drop in supply awarded to foreign participants throughout 2019; BMO says that adding to this positive, is a strong seasonality in December, with the last eight 10-year auctions seeing foreign bidders take 19.5%, versus a 13.7% average. Meanwhile, other positives include 10s trading special in repo (which means the liquidity value of the auction could be a factor in judging overall demand). There will be no SOMA add-ons. In terms of potential negative factors, Wednesday's FOMC introduces some event risk, BMO says; \"even if valuations do not deter buying, some investors may opt to wait for the passage of this week’s central bank meetings to add duration exposure.\" The bank also observes ETF flows in the 7-10 year sector have turned negative on a cumulative monthly basis, which it says is not a good sign of momentum for the sector. Elsewhere, it observes that 10-year auctions in December have negative seasonality, with nine of the last 14 December 10-year auctions tailing.</p><p><strong>RECENT 10-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.809%, six-auction avg. 1.815%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -1.0bps, six-auction avg. 0.3bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.49x, six-auction avg. 2.41x)&nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 23.1%, six-auction avg. 25.7%)&nbsp;</li><li>Direct: (prev. 12.4%, six-auction avg. 13.0%)&nbsp;</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 64.5%, six-auction avg. 61.3%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains mixed against major counterparts and on the defensive ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC policy pronouncements, new SEP and final 2019 post-meeting press conference from Fed Chair Powell, with the <strong>DXY</strong> dipping below 97.500 before meeting underlying buying interest ahead of technical support in the form of last Friday’s low (97.355). Moreover, a flip-flop in US Treasury yields and reversal of earlier flattening into 10 year issuance may give the Greenback a bit more impetus amidst confirmation that the USMCA trade pact has been agreed and speculation that the US and China are likely to postpone pending tariffs. However, US President Trump is said to be still undecided on the latter and could yet sanction the higher import levies for December 15 as the 2 sides continue to haggle over how much agricultural goods Beijing buys as part of the Phase 1 deal.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Buck, but with the Pound still outperforming on pre-GE polls predicting a Tory victory, albeit after a closer result and in advance of the last YouGov MRP before Thursday’s UK vote due for release at 10 pm London time. Cable notched another new multi-month peak just shy of 1.3200 having revisited sub-1.3150 territory in early EU trade and quickly setting aside some underwhelming or even bleak data, while Eur/Gbp pulled back from around 0.8430 to within a whisker of 0.8400 as the single only gleaned a degree of support from an improvement in ZEW sentiment, expectations and current conditions to a lesser extent. Eur/Usd did get a late boost as the Dollar slipped afresh, but remains capped into 1.1100 and Usd/Chf got a bit closer to 0.9850 even though Eur/Chf bounced from lows within a 1.0968-13 range eyeing SNB and ECB meetings also scheduled for Thursday.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Eur/Nok extended its post-Norges Bank regional survey highs to 10.1900+ at one stage, but the Norwegian Krona regained some composure as risk sentiment picked up, while the Swedish Crown held up better ahead of next week’s Riksbank policy call that has already been firmly flagged in terms of a 25 bp hike.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD/JPY</strong></p><p>Usd/Cad and Usd/Mxn both largely consolidating following declarations from the US and Mexico pending a call and presumably official word from Canada that the draft of a USMCA agreement has finally been reached, but the Aussie and Kiwi are still underperforming on US-China uncertainty, and with Aud/Usd looking for some independent impetus from RBA’s Bullock after little via Governor Lowe late yesterday. Meanwhile, the Yen is still stuck in a rut between 108.50-75 after a further failure to break below and fluctuating with overall swings in the market mood.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another bad day at the office for the Rand and mainly due to persistent production issues for Eskom rather than actual SA manufacturing output that beat consensus, though not exactly strong in y/y terms. Note, President Ramaphosa has cut short a foreign visit to return home and meet the high brass at the troubled utility.</p>",

(Unch.)</strong> conformed to the lackadaisical picture as participants second-guessed whether the US will proceed with the 15% tariffs on virtually all of the remaining imports from China scheduled for Sunday and in which China have already set retaliatory tariffs due the same day. Furthermore, continued PBoC liquidity inaction, as well as warnings from a senior Chinese economist on looser fiscal and monetary policies next year also contributed to the subdued risk appetite. Finally, 10yr JGBs fluctuated in which prices were initially pressured and briefly slipped below the 152.00 level amid gains in yields in which the 10yr yield rose to 0.0% for the first time since March, with selling in JGBs exacerbated following the weaker results at the 5yr auction which showed a slightly softer b/c, a drop in accepted prices and wider tail in price, although 10yr JGBs then staged an aggressive rebound to recoup all the earlier losses.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

DAX futures and cash have retreated below the key 13k level after the former breached its Dec 5th/6th low ~13045 and its Dec low at 12924, with eyes now on its Nov low (12888.5) and 50 DMA (12880) as the index future gives up the 12900 mark. Other major bourses are broadly in the red with little by way of fresh fundamental factors to add to the overall narrative during the session, that said, participants gear up for a risk-packed week, with the US imposition of China tariffs on Dec 15th still looming. Sectors are all in negative territory, although some resilience is seen in defensives which reflects the overall risk picture in the region. The healthcare sector is outperforming its peers as Sanofi (+4.8%) shares cushion the segment - after the drug-maker released plans to reorganise its business which will see it narrow the number of global business units in an attempt to bolster growth and profits, whilst aiming to save EUR 2.0bln by 2022. Other notable movers include Deutsche Bank (-0.3%) whose shares opened higher after affirming its 2019, 2020 and 2022 targets, albeit shares dipped into negative territory on the DAX’s demise. Elsewhere, Ashtead Group (-7.5%) rests at the foot of the FTSE 100 amid fears that the UK market will remain challenging.</p><p>TSMC (2330 TT) November sales rose 9.7% Y/Y to TWD 107.9bln.

Norges Bank contacts also reported slower growth in all sectors of the economy and several respondents noted more uncertainty due to the adverse knock-on effects of global trade turbulence. The Q4 findings overshadowed inflation data that came in as forecast across the board in contrast to softer Swedish Prospera CPIF expectations, albeit with relatively little impact on the SEK given the fact that the Riksbank has underscored December repo rate hike intentions.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR - </strong>Sterling survived another bout of all round selling pressure amidst rising option volatility ahead of Thursday’s UK election and the final YouGov MRP poll to rebound firmly in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms even though data was disappointing on balance (m/m GDP flat, ip sub-consensus and trade gaps much wider than anticipated). In fact, the Pound is probing fresh peaks vs the Dollar circa 1.3190 and retesting 0.8400 against the single currency that has not derived much momentum from upbeat ZEW metrics for Germany and the Eurozone as a whole, with the former somewhat diluted by caveats. Indeed, Eur/Usd only mustered enough strength to register a 1.1080 high before fading and perhaps feeling the weight of hefty option expiries sitting between 1.1065-70 (2.3 bn).</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY - </strong>The Franc continues to claw back lost ground vs the Greenback and Euro regardless of the looming SNB quarterly policy review and prospect of any tweak in assessment of the Swiss currency, or even direct intervention, with Usd/Chf edging closer to 0.9850 and Eur/Chf eyeing 1.0900. However, the Yen continues to respect 108.50 resistance and a Fib retracement in very close proximity (108.49) amidst decent expiry interest from 108.60-65 (1.5 bn), as the DXY narrowly maintains 97.500+ status).</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD - </strong>The Loonie continues to trade on a firmer footing within 1.3245-25 parameters vs its US counterpart alongside the Mexican Peso (between 19.2450-19.2000 on the wide) on USMCA accord hopes, but the Kiwi and Aussie in particular are still treading cautiously ahead of the Fed and US-China tariff deadline, as Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd pivot 0.6550 and 0.6825 respectively and Aud/Nzd keeps its head above 1.0400.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>More volatile trade for the Rand and Eskom-related depreciation overshadowing bullish SA data in the form of manufacturing production, with Usd/Zar elevated within a 14.6275-7700 band.</p><p>Australian NAB Business Confidence (Nov) 0 (Prev. 2).

Front-month WTI and Brent futures popped higher to 59.40/bbl and 64.68/bbl respectively from below the round figures and with a lack of fresh fundamental news-flow to influence prices. Energy futures then reversed earlier gains and printed fresh session lows. Crude markets are susceptible to increased volatility as we go through the week with a number of key macro risk events on the radar – including FOMC and ECB monetary policy decisions, UK general election, US’ scheduled imposition of tariffs on USD 160bln worth of Chinese goods, whilst crude specific drivers include the weekly inventory data and the monthly oil reports – with the EIA STEO due later today.&nbsp; Meanwhile, <strong>gold prices</strong> remain underpinned by the downside in the equity complex and ahead of the aforementioned events, whilst in terms of commentary – Goldman Sachs and UBS both see the yellow metal prices climbing to USD 1600/oz, above Commerzbank view of USD 1500/oz, amid the current trade environment, but caveat that it is unclear what Central Banks will do during 2020. Meanwhile, copper prices remain on the front-foot and is poised (thus far) for a third straight session of gains as the red metal creeps up to USD 2.75/lb. ING highlight a number of factors driving the upside 1) last week’s positive trade message after china said they would wave tariffs on imports of US pork and soybean, 2) China’s Central Economic Conference vowing to maintain economic growth in a reasonable range – adding to copper demand 3) the downward trend in LME inventories and 4) disappointing short-term scrap import quotas. Finally, Dalian<strong> iron ore </strong>futures rose in excess of 3.0% to its highest in over four months amid supply uncertainties expected to arise in Q1 2020, with some miners such a Vale also lowering production outlook.</p><p>Azerbaijan's oil production (November), was 776k BPD vs. October's 718k BPD., Energy Ministry.

On the other side, in addition to a commitment to buy specific amounts of US ags products, the US demands China make concessions on intellectual property rights, currency and access to China’s financial services sectors, which may be harder to achieve; these other factors may be kicked into the next phase of trade talks, which may keep trade uncertainty in the forefront of traders minds in 2020, heading into the November Presidential elections.</li><li>Regarding the 15th December tariffs, desks are on the lookout for two key catalysts: 1) Any indication that the US would delay the 15th December tariff boost, or any more warmer noises on potential tariff rollbacks; 2) any commentary which suggests that the two sides are preparing to meet face-to-face, which may signal agreement on a deal ‘in principle’.

DAX futures and cash have retreated below the key 13k level after the former breached its Dec 5th/6th low ~13045 and its Dec low at 12924, with eyes now on its Nov low (12888.5) and 50 DMA (12880) as the index future gives up the 12900 mark. Other major bourses are broadly in the red with little by way of fresh fundamental factors to add to the overall narrative during the session, that said, participants gear up for a risk-packed week, with the US imposition of China tariffs on Dec 15th still looming. Sectors are all in negative territory, although some resilience is seen in defensives which reflects the overall risk picture in the region. The healthcare sector is outperforming its peers as Sanofi (+4.8%) shares cushion the segment - after the drug-maker released plans to reorganise its business which will see it narrow the number of global business units in an attempt to bolster growth and profits, whilst aiming to save EUR 2.0bln by 2022. Other notable movers include Deutsche Bank (-0.3%) whose shares opened higher after affirming its 2019, 2020 and 2022 targets, albeit shares dipped into negative territory on the DAX’s demise. Elsewhere, Ashtead Group (-7.5%) rests at the foot of the FTSE 100 amid fears that the UK market will remain challenging.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NOK</strong> - The clear G10 laggard as Eur/Nok bounces further from sub-1.1000 lows towards 10.1900 on the back of the latest Norwegian regional survey revealing downgrades to output over the previous quarter and outlook for 6 months ahead. Norges Bank contacts also reported slower growth in all sectors of the economy and several respondents noted more uncertainty due to the adverse knock-on effects of global trade turbulence. The Q4 findings overshadowed inflation data that came in as forecast across the board in contrast to softer Swedish Prospera CPIF expectations, albeit with relatively little impact on the SEK given the fact that the Riksbank has underscored December repo rate hike intentions.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong> - Sterling survived another bout of all round selling pressure amidst rising option volatility ahead of Thursday’s UK election and the final YouGov MRP poll to rebound firmly in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms even though data was disappointing on balance (m/m GDP flat, ip sub-consensus and trade gaps much wider than anticipated). In fact, the Pound is probing fresh peaks vs the Dollar circa 1.3190 and retesting 0.8400 against the single currency that has not derived much momentum from upbeat ZEW metrics for Germany and the Eurozone as a whole, with the former somewhat diluted by caveats. Indeed, Eur/Usd only mustered enough strength to register a 1.1080 high before fading and perhaps feeling the weight of hefty option expiries sitting between 1.1065-70 (2.3 bn).</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong> - The Franc continues to claw back lost ground vs the Greenback and Euro regardless of the looming SNB quarterly policy review and prospect of any tweak in assessment of the Swiss currency, or even direct intervention, with Usd/Chf edging closer to 0.9850 and Eur/Chf eyeing 1.0900. However, the Yen continues to respect 108.50 resistance and a Fib retracement in very close proximity (108.49) amidst decent expiry interest from 108.60-65 (1.5 bn), as the DXY narrowly maintains 97.500+ status).</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD</strong> - The Loonie continues to trade on a firmer footing within 1.3245-25 parameters vs its US counterpart alongside the Mexican Peso (between 19.2450-19.2000 on the wide) on USMCA accord hopes, but the Kiwi and Aussie in particular are still treading cautiously ahead of the Fed and US-China tariff deadline, as Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd pivot 0.6550 and 0.6825 respectively and Aud/Nzd keeps its head above 1.0400.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - More volatile trade for the Rand and Eskom-related depreciation overshadowing bullish SA data in the form of manufacturing production, with Usd/Zar elevated within a 14.6275-7700 band.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>EU bonds have staged another recovery sortie, and perhaps the latest leg down in stocks has prompted some asset-switching or front running in case the equity selling escalates into a rout. Moreover, <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasury</strong> resilience may be finally spilling over as <strong>Bunds</strong> pare declines to single digits and <strong>Gilts</strong> to 14 ticks from -30 and -28 ticks at worst, while the 10 year note future floats above 129-00 and the corresponding yield flirts with 1.80% even though supply looms.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Crude markets are choppy </strong>– with recent action attributed to potential technical play. Front-month <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures popped higher to 59.40/bbl and 64.68/bbl respectively from below the round figures and with a lack of fresh fundamental news-flow to influence prices. Energy futures then reversed earlier gains and printed fresh session lows. Crude markets are susceptible to increased volatility as we go through the week with a number of key macro risk events on the radar – including FOMC and ECB monetary policy decisions, UK general election, US’ scheduled imposition of tariffs on USD 160bln worth of Chinese goods, whilst crude specific drivers include the weekly inventory data and the monthly oil reports – with the EIA STEO due later today.&nbsp; Meanwhile, <strong>gold</strong> prices remain underpinned by the downside in the equity complex and ahead of the aforementioned events, whilst in terms of commentary – Goldman Sachs and UBS both see the yellow metal prices climbing to USD 1600/oz, above Commerzbank view of USD 1500/oz, amid the current trade environment, but caveat that it is unclear what Central Banks will do during 2020. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices remain on the front-foot and is poised (thus far) for a third straight session of gains as the red metal creeps up to USD 2.75/lb. ING highlight a number of factors driving the upside 1) last week’s positive trade message after china said they would wave tariffs on imports of US pork and soybean, 2) China’s Central Economic Conference vowing to maintain economic growth in a reasonable range – adding to copper demand 3) the downward trend in LME inventories and 4) disappointing short-term scrap import quotas. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> i<strong>ron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> <strong>futures</strong> rose in excess of 3.0% to its highest in over four months amid supply uncertainties expected to arise in Q1 2020, with some miners such a Vale also lowering production outlook.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) were subdued with Australia pressured by underperformance in most of the trade sensitive sectors but with losses limited by resilience in commodity names, while favourable currency moves also helped stem the downside for Tokyo-listed exporters. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) conformed to the lackadaisical picture as participants second-guessed whether the US will proceed with the 15% tariffs on virtually all of the remaining imports from China scheduled for Sunday and in which China have already set retaliatory tariffs due the same day. Furthermore, continued PBoC liquidity inaction, as well as warnings from a senior Chinese economist on looser fiscal and monetary policies next year also contributed to the subdued risk appetite.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>BAE Systems (BA/ LN)</strong> – The Trump administration is said to be pressuring Japan to choose a US defence company to develop a replacement for its F-2 fighter jets.

(Unch.)</strong> conformed to the lackadaisical picture as participants second-guessed whether the US will proceed with the 15% tariffs on virtually all of the remaining imports from China scheduled for Sunday and in which China have already set retaliatory tariffs due the same day. Furthermore, continued PBoC liquidity inaction, as well as warnings from a senior Chinese economist on looser fiscal and monetary policies next year also contributed to the subdued risk appetite. Finally, 10yr JGBs fluctuated in which prices were initially pressured and briefly slipped below the 152.00 level amid gains in yields in which the 10yr yield rose to 0.0% for the first time since March, with selling in JGBs exacerbated following the weaker results at the 5yr auction which showed a slightly softer b/c, a drop in accepted prices and wider tail in price, although 10yr JGBs then staged an aggressive rebound to recoup all the earlier losses.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

In addition, House Democrats are to unveil articles of impeachment today in which 2 articles are expected to be drafted against President Trump regarding abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Elsewhere, <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was relatively flat with price action stuck near a large option expiry of EUR 1.8bln at 1.1070 for the upcoming New York cut and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> has again reverted to the 1.3150 level as attention turns to the latest YouGov MRP model due later at 2200GMT. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> eked marginal gains, while antipodeans were also mildly supported following a stable PBoC reference rate and firmer than expected inflation data from China which showed CPI at its largest growth in almost 8 years amid a 19.1% increase in food prices as pork prices more than doubled Y/Y.</p><p>Australian NAB Business Confidence (Nov) 0 (Prev. 2). (Newswires) Australian NAB Business Conditions (Nov) 4 (Prev. 3)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed in which WTI crude futures consolidated after last week’s OPEC-induced advances as overnight price action was contained by resistance at the USD 59.00/bbl, with reports of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia likely to reduce the risk of the conflict’s potential impact on gas supplies, while focus for the complex now shifts to the latest inventory reports beginning with today’s APIs. Elsewhere, gold prices remained subdued amid similar uneventful trade for the greenback as participants await the looming risk events including tomorrow’s FOMC, while copper conformed to the humdrum tone across the complex due to the broad tentative risk appetite.</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>US government believes that Iran is behind a series of increasingly sophisticated rocket attacks on joint US-Iraq military facilities in Iraq, according to reports citing US officials.

(Newswires/Time)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ukrainian President Zelenskiy announced that they agreed steps with Russia to implement full and unlimited ceasefire in the east of the country, with the leaders aiming for a new withdrawal of forces from Ukraine conflict zones by March 2020, Furthermore, Zelenskiy commented that many issues are unresolved but dialogue is good, although other reports noted he was said to regret that very little was achieved at the Paris summit. (Newswires/AFP)&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>Yields were little changed in the TPLEX, ahead of a key week for event risk (Fed, ECB, and the looming 15th December US/China tariff deadline); it has seen a cautious start to the week. Major curve spreads had a bias towards narrowing, though the size of the moves is within 2bps. The US Treasury today sold a new 3-year note (USD 38bln), which stopped through by 0.2bps. Cover came in above recent averages; the direct bid and the indirect bid were fairly steady, though directs stepped up participation. US T-note futures settle 3 ticks higher at 129-00.</p><p>US President Trump said we are doing well on USMCA and that he hears from unions it is looking very good, while it was also reported that USTR Lighthizer, Trump Advisor Kushner and Canadian Deputy PM Freeland are heading to Mexico today for talks on completing the USMCA trade agreement. (Newswires/CNBC) There were initial reports that White House and Democrats reached a tentative deal on USMCA in which the House could vote on the deal on 18th December according to sources, although US House Speaker Pelosi later stated that a USMCA trade deal is not agreed to in which that they must see implementing legislation and that we are close but not quite finished yet in reaching a deal. Furthermore, Pelosi commented she expects USMCA treaty to be set by Tuesday, while US House and Ways Committee Chairman Neal also anticipates a USMCA announcement on Tuesday afternoon.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets have resumed the cautious global risk tone heading into this week’s plethora of risk events and amid ongoing trade uncertainty from the looming US-China tariff deadline set for December 15th. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) are lower with Australia pressured by underperformance in most of the trade sensitive sectors although resilience in its commodity names has restricted the losses, while favourable currency moves also helps stem the downside for Tokyo-listed exporters. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) conform to the lackadaisical picture as participants second-guess whether the US proceeds with the 15% tariffs on virtually all of the remaining imports from China scheduled for Sunday and in which China have already set retaliatory tariffs due the same day. Furthermore, continued PBoC liquidity inaction, as well as warnings from a senior Chinese economist on looser fiscal and monetary policies next year also contributes to the subdued trade.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains rangebound heading into the upcoming FOMC with US-China and USMCA trade uncertainty warranting the cautiousness in the greenback, although the latest reports have noted expectations for a potential USMCA announcement on Tuesday afternoon as USTR Lighthizer, Trump Adviser Kushner and Canadian Deputy PM Freeland all head to Mexico for talks to complete the deal which has kept both CAD and MXN underpinned against the USD. In addition, House Democrats are to unveil articles of impeachment this Tuesday in which 2 articles are expected to be drafted against President Trump regarding abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is relatively flat with trade stuck near a large option expiry of EUR 1.8bln at 1.1070 for the upcoming New York cut and GBP/USD has again reverted to the 1.3150 level as the latest ICM Research poll suggested just a 6-point lead for the Conservatives ahead of the election on Thursday with attention turning to the latest YouGov MRP model due later at 2200GMT. Elsewhere, USD/JPY eked marginal gains, while antipodeans are also mildly supported following a stable PBoC reference rate and mostly firmer than expected inflation data from China.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower and briefly slipped below the 152.00 level amid gains in yields in which the 10yr yield rose to 0.0% for the first time since March, with prices also subdued with participants sidelined ahead of a 5yr JGB auction.</p>",
