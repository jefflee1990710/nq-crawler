(Xinhua)</p><p>US President Trump said that China made a \"good gesture\" with the latest tariff exclusions, while he quoted tweets about China’s tariff suspension which suggested China was being hit very hard with supply chains breaking up as many companies move, or look to move to other countries and that it was much more expensive to China than originally thought.

(Fox Business News)</p><p>China’s Former Leading Agriculture Negotiator Guoqiang stated that China should continue to use purchases of US farm products as a \"countermeasure\" in US trade talks, while he added China should avoid over dependence on imports and rely mainly on domestic supplies to meet demand.

Furthermore, UK Operation Yellowhammer (government's reasonable worst case Brexit scenario) papers have been released which discussed public and business readiness will be at a low level and that the EU would not be nearly as badly affected as the UK, although Business Minister Leadsom is sticking with the UK government and will not publish the full details of its Operation Yellowhammer No Deal contingency planning despite being ordered to by MPs.

Of the 70 economists polled by Reuters, around a quarter look for a 20bps reduction with the remainder looking for 10bps. Elsewhere, the survey noted that almost 90% of respondents expected a resumption of bond purchases as of October with a touted monthly amount of EUR 30bln”. In order to mitigate the impact of deeper negative rates on the Eurozone banking sector, around 90% of those surveyed looks for some form of tiering system.<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22737/download\"> Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES: </strong>ECB is to cut some growth projections; both 2019 and 2020 GDP expansion seen not far above 1% and the banks projections on headline and underlying inflation to show a slow protracted rise in the coming years. The sources go on to say that the forecasts suggest that even with a new round of stimulus, the ECB will struggle to hit its inflation target of 2%, something it has failed to do since 2013.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> China announced that some US products will be exempted from additional 25% tariffs; on the face of it, the news appears to be a trade concession ahead of October talks, however,&nbsp; the items are mainly lubricants and fodder (and crucially, does not include soybeans, pork, or corn), but is probably more focussed on its own domestic economy, ING believes, pointing out that the US also exempted 110 imported Chinese products from tariffs back in July, most of which were medical equipment and parts, which are high-value products. \"If exemptions are viewed as a form of concession, then the US has given more,\" ING says. \"There are still many uncertainties in the coming trade talks. An exemption list of just 16 items will not change China's stance,\" ING writes, \"We believe that China will stand very firm in the negotiations, which will be similar to the last round of talks.\" US President Trump later said that China had made a “good gesture” with latest exemptions, whilst Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said to the US delegation in Beijing that he believes they have the wisdom to find a solution acceptable to both. However, towards the market close Fox’s Gasparino tweeted a ‘Senior Chinese Diplomat stated China cannot be deterred in anti-poverty efforts, long term growth strategy even amid trade talks; adding they will not make any compromise, even promising to eliminate IP theft, as it would stall growth’.</p><p><strong>* TRADE COMMENT:</strong> There have been apparently more constructive overtures out of China this week (sweeteners like buying more US ags, exempting some products from additional tariffs). But it is questionable whether these are enough to bridge the large gaps between the two sides and strike a trade deal. China's exemptions of some US products from additional tariffs is similar to the US' moves to delay some tariffs, analysts have said, while the 'sweeteners' reported by SCMP on Tuesday still do not include some of the US' major gripes (like SOE reform). However, the measures do provide President Trump with favourable optics to perhaps delay tariff hikes, slated for mid-December (allowing Trump a 'win' and avoiding measures which Trump has tacitly acknowledged may harm the US consumer). For the Chinese, it provides a sense of calm and progress ahead of the 70th Anniversary of the PRC on 1st October. The kicker here is that while this might not lead to a sustainable trade breakthrough, it might set a friendlier landscape between the two sides, which could keep markets optimistic while central banks are adding to the punch bowl.</p><p><strong>* US PPI:</strong> US producer prices saw a surprise to the upside in August, although analysts suggest it might be noise, reversing last month’s unusual decline. \"The bigger picture is that underlying services inflation remains muted, while any inflationary impact of tariffs is being offset by a weaker renminbi and substitution towards other low-cost producers in Asia,\" Capital Economics said. Core goods producer prices were unchanged, and CapEco suggest that it implies that any inflationary impact from tariffs has been offset by a weakening renminbi and substitution away from Chinese imports towards other low-cost producers in the region. And this should provide a supporting factor for the Fed to lower rates at its policy meeting next week, CapEco said.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US President Trump reportedly considered easing Iranian sanctions which prompted former National Security Advisor Bolton to resign, it was later reported that Us Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expressed support for the move in an effort to secure a meeting between Trump and Iran’s president Rouhani. The Iranian Envoy to the UN said that US National Security Advisor Bolton's departure will not move the nation towards reconsidering discussions with the US, adding that talks cannot commence until the US abandons its policy of economic pressure on Iran. Elsewhere, China’s Ambassador to Germany said that there was sufficient proof that foreign forces intervened in Hong Kong, and that the reception of Hong Kong activist Wong in Berlin has sent a very negative signal for bilateral relations.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> Cut its 2019 oil demand growth forecast by 80k BPD to 1.02mln BPD - in fitting with the EIA’s recent demand growth cut to 0.9mln BPD - citing weaker than expected H1 data from various global demand centres. Both EIA and OPEC have now also cut 2020 global oil demand growth (EIA forecast 1.4mln BPD, OPEC forecasts 1.08mln BPD). OPEC crude production in August rose 136k BPD to average 29.74mln BPD, where output increased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iraq and the UAE, while production in Venezuela, Iran, Libya, Kuwait and Algeria declined.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLED USD 1.65 LOWER AT USD 55.75/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLED USD 1.57 LOWER AT USD 60.81/BBL:</strong> Crude benchmarks both lost over one and a half bucks on the barrel following a mixed EIA inventory report, another forecast downgrade in oil demand growth by OPEC and further signs of easing US-Iran tensions. The EIA reported crude stocks drawing 6.9mln bbls (exp. -2.7mln), slightly less bullish than the API reported 7.2mln bbls draw, where Cushing reported a 0.8mln bbl draw, smaller than the API; products were more bearish than expected with a large 2.7mln bbl build in distillates (exp. +0.07mln) and gasoline drawing 0.68mln bbls, much less than the 4.5mln bbls draw reported by API. Elsewhere in the EIA report, net imports fell by 0.4mln BPD to 3.4mln BPD; production remained at 12.4mln BPD whilst refinery utilisation ramping up 0.3%. Not long after the EIA release bulls were caught offside on the reports that the US had considered easing sanctions on Iran to establish talks between Presidents Trump and Rouhani.</p><p><strong>* OPEC JMMC:</strong> Ahead of Thursday’s JMMC meeting it appears deeper production cuts from OPEC+ aren’t to be expected in the outset given that kingpin, Russian Energy Minister Novak, said there are no plans to discuss them at the meeting, but did mention that the slowing global demand for oil will be a discussion. There have been contrasting comments however, Iraqi Oil Minister said they will have a discussion on whether or not there is the need for a deeper production cut (something that Oman’s Oil Minister also echoed in an Argus interview), adding that a deeper cut of 1.6mln-1.8mln BPD had been proposed at a previous JMMC meeting (currently 1.2mln BPD). Given the volatile nature of OPEC/OPEC+ meetings, one would be foolish to not consider the possibility of a divergence from the status quo, although consensus going in is for guidance on production cuts to remain as current through H2.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (Z9) SETTLES 8 TICKS LOWER AT 129-29.</strong> Fixed Income continued its sell-off on Wednesday, albeit more modestly, with haven demand limited on the back of US-China trade “gestures” and tentativeness ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday. At settlement the curve had steepened, with yields higher most pronounced in the belly, the 2s10s was 1bps wider, whilst the 10s30s was 1bps narrower. The back-up in yields seen of late is not just confined to the US, it has been global. Analysts note that the rise has been led by real yields, which could be an indication that the market perceives central banks will disappointing in their largesse in the weeks ahead (ECB tomorrow, a package of measures is expected, but recent newsflow has suggested it might not be as aggressive as markets would desire, while the idea of an FOMC 50bps cut has dissipated after Chair Powell's remarks last week).</p><p><strong>* 10-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> The 10-year auction held up okay, with a tail of 0.3bps considered respectful given the recent rate back-up. The slightly above average B/C ratio of 2.46x being complemented by slightly above average Directs and Indirects takedown.</p><p><strong>* US 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> Thursday's 30s auction is complicated by the ECB policy meeting, as well as the release of August CPI out of the US, both of which are on the slate for before the auction. SocGen's strategists say that, from a relative-value perspective, the 30-year sector appears rich in asset swap versus the previous 30s auction cycle. Recently, five of the six 30-year auctions have tailed, and cover ratios have been easing. \"This shows that investors in general are shying away from the 30y auction,\" SocGen argues, \"moreover, the 30-year yield reached an all-time low at end-August, and although it has since increased slightly, it is unlikely that the upcoming auction will attract favourable bidding.\" On the positive side, the bank notes relatively low dealers’ holdings, as well as the current 30-year trading special in repo, which might be supportive. With that said, the two aforementioned events complicate the auction, adding event risk, and accordingly, SocGen says it is neutral to slightly negative on the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>likely benefited from the firmer than expected PPI data and shrugged off comments from President Trump calling on the Fed to lower rates to ‘Zero or less’. Rate differentials may also be benefitting the green back as US 10-year yields are firmer approaching 1.75%, up from the 1.5530% low earlier in the week. Havens were mixed despite positive trade rhetoric from China where trump quoted it as a ‘good gesture’, <strong>JPY</strong> was lower on the day as participants await tomorrow's ECB and US CPI on Friday. <strong>XAU</strong> however was higher with solid gains on the day as it heads towards the key 1500 level; CHF was flat.&nbsp; <strong>EUR</strong> was lower against the likes of GBP, JPY and CHF, irrespective of independent drivers for the Pound, Yen and Franc as markets prepare for some degree of stimulus tomorrow. <strong>CAD </strong>traded lower today against the greenback taking its queue from dollar strength with Canada’s capacity utilisation data beating estimates doing little to provide any strength to the Loonie. Canadian PM Trudeau also officially launched his campaign for an October 21st election, as expected. <strong>NZDUSD</strong> pulled back to around 0.6408 from 0.6430 ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI and Westpac consumer sentiment on Thursday and Friday respectively, but managed to hold above the big figure as <strong>AUDNZD</strong> remained between 1.0705-1.0680 parameters. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed, <strong>MXN</strong> was weaker on the day against the buck and not helped by dovish comments from the Banxico Deputy Governor who stated there is room for more cuts in the upcoming months. <strong>TRY</strong> was firmer against the greenback heading into tomorrow’s CBRT rate decision where they are expected to cut rates between 175-475bps.<strong> BRL</strong> derived some support from big Brazilian retail sales beat, with <strong>USDBRL</strong> down near the base of a 4.0920-0525 range.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.7% at 3001, NASDAQ-100 0.9% at 7888, Dow Jones 0.9% at 27137.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, Consumer Staples 0.4%, Energy 0%, Financials 0.6%, Health Care 1%, Industrials 1%, Information Technology 1%, Materials 1%, Telecommunication Services 1%, Utilities 1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) helped support indices at the open with some extended gains post its special event on Tuesday. Baker Hughes (BHGE) came under pressure after General Electric (GE) announced it would relinquish its majority stake back to it. Altria (MO) was a laggard thanks to the US FDA implementing a ban on flavoured tobacco e-cigarettes. Boeing (BA) drifted higher, catching tailwinds from constructive comments from its CEO on the 737 MAX. Newmont Mining (NEM) and Micron (MU) opened higher following upgrades at BMO and Longbow, respectively, whereas J.B. Hunt (JBHT) and Costco (COST) opened lower at Loop and Oppenheimer, respectively. Cisco (CSCO) benefitted from an Outperform initiation at Evercore. Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) opened on the backfoot following California passing in the new bill which requires the pair to class its drivers as official employees, but soon turned into outperformers as participants continue to digest the implications. General Motors (GM) underperformed amid it announcing a 3.5mln vehicle recall in the US as a result of faulty braking systems.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson said the UK can manage very well without a Brexit deal and that he wants a high wage, low tax economy. Johnson reiterated his widely known stances that the backstop will be removed, and he will not accept a Northern Ireland only backstop, but they will work for a deal and that great progress has been made. Also, a Scottish court found Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament unlawful, where it will now likely go to the UK Supreme Court. The ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ documents were posted, where they state food prices will increase given the reduced availability and that small businesses are less prepared in the event of a no deal.</p><p><strong>* CBRT PREVIEW: </strong>All 23 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the Turkish Central Bank to cut rates, but analysts are split on the size of the move. The magnitude of the cut could be between 175bps and 475bps, according to surveys, with the exact size likely to depend on how the Central Bank views the evolution of inflation. However, desks are cognizant of Turkey’s frail economy, and the Lira’s fragile nature amid geopolitical tensions with the US, as well as President Erdogan’s influence on the Central Bank. It’s also worth keeping in mind that larger-than-forecast move would not be unprecedented, given that the CBRT hiked rates by 625bps in September last year to stem Lira weakness, and a 425bps cut in July which surprised analysts. Meanwhile, pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Şafak recently stated that the CBRT may cut rates by 500bp. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22749/download\">Click here for full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>",

The EIA reported crude stocks drawing 6.9mln bbls (exp. -2.7mln), slightly less bullish than the API reported 7.2mln bbls draw, where Cushing reported a 0.8mln bbl draw, smaller than the API; products were more bearish than expected with a large 2.7mln bbl build in distillates (exp. +0.07mln) and gasoline drawing 0.68mln bbls, much less than the 4.5mln bbls draw reported by API. Elsewhere in the EIA report, net imports fell by 0.4mln BPD to 3.4mln BPD; production remained at 12.4mln BPD whilst refinery utilisation ramping up 0.3%. Not long after the EIA release bulls were caught offside on the reports that the US had considered easing sanctions on Iran to establish talks between Presidents Trump and Rouhani.</p><p><strong>OPEC JMMC:</strong> Ahead of Thursday’s JMMC meeting it appears deeper production cuts from OPEC+ aren’t to be expected in the outset given that kingpin, Russian Energy Minister Novak, said there are no plans to discuss them at the meeting, but did mention that the slowing global demand for oil will be a discussion. There have been contrasting comments however, Iraqi Oil Minister said they will have a discussion on whether or not there is the need for a deeper production cut (something that Oman’s Oil Minister also echoed in an Argus interview), adding that a deeper cut of 1.6mln-1.8mln BPD had been proposed at a previous JMMC meeting (currently 1.2mln BPD). Given the volatile nature of OPEC/OPEC+ meetings, one would be foolish to not consider the possibility of a divergence from the status quo, although consensus going in is for guidance on production cuts to remain as current through H2.</p>",

SocGen says the steepening of 2s10s seen since late August, however, does make the sector look attractive, though the bank highlights that 2s10s has actually flattened by around 10bps since the previous auction cycle (NOTE: August's auction was soft). On the other side of the coin, SocGen observes that the current 10-year note trades special in repo, and dealer holdings in the 7-10 year bucket is low; both of these factors could be supportive for the auction. \"Even so,\" SocGen writes, \"the auction will likely demand a concession to go well, as the current when-issued yield is well below all auction stops since August 2016.\" The bank says it is neutral on the September 10-year auction.</p><p><strong>RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tail:</strong> (prev. 1.7bps, six-auction avg 0.4bps)</li><li><strong>High yield:</strong> (prev. 1.67%, six-auction avg 2.237%)</li><li><strong>Bid-to-cover:</strong> (prev. 2.2x, six-auction avg 2.4x)</li><li><strong>Dealers:</strong> (prev. 30.72%, six-auction avg 25.7%)</li><li><strong>Directs:</strong> (prev. 13.56%, six-auction avg 12.1%)</li><li><strong>Indirects:</strong> (prev. 55.72%, six-auction avg 62.2%)</li></ul>",

Advances were also seen across the Apple supply chain in Japan and Taiwan following the tech giant’s launch event where it announced a new streaming service and health app, as well as new iWatch, iPhone and iPad models. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) </strong>were mixed after a tepid PBoC liquidity effort in which the mainland failed to take impetus from China’s fresh efforts to further open its financial markets by dropping QFII and RQFII quota limits. Sources noted China is ready to sweeten a deal by buying US goods, however, the report added that a purchase agreement is no certainty and would be in exchange for a delay on tariffs as well as an easing of restrictions on Huawei. China’s Global Times Editor also later suggested China will introduce important measures to ease the impact from the trade war which would benefit some companies from both China and the US which briefly fuelled appetite for risk.

Turning to individual movers, LSE (+5.6%) shares spiked higher amid reports that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing have proposed a combination with LSE, terms of proposed deal would imply an enterprise value of GBP 31.6bln, and the transaction implies a value of GBP 83.61 for each LSE share. LSE said its board will consider the proposal. On the flip side, Suez (-1.3%) and Kone (-1.9%) opened lower amid downgrades, although the former saw some upside amid reports that the Co. won an approx.

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> Not quite the biggest G10 loser or underperformer, but the single currency has been a notable mover after topping out above 1.1050 against the Dollar and failing to close above key resistance just below yet again (1.1049 represents a 38.2% retracement of the decline from 1.1249 to 1.0926 ytd low). Eur/Gbp selling into the early 9 am fix may also have impacted, as the cross retests recent sub-0.8925 lows, but Eur/Usd is holding around the 10 DMA and bids said to be sitting just below (at 1.1022 and 1.1020 respectively) with one eye on Thursday’s ECB meeting and some form of easing/stimulus as German institutes continue to downgrade GDP estimates, while the other keeps tabs on higher global bond yields/spreads.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF -</strong> More safe-haven unwinding has nudged the Yen and Franc down to circa 107.85 and 0.9940 vs the Buck, and Usd/Jpy has breached a Fib, exporter offers plus a cloud top formation in the process, at 107.49, 107.50 and 107.71, with some fundamental/macro impetus stemming from another upturn in US Treasury yields and more curve steepening against the backdrop of positive-looking US-China trade headlines (such as Chinese tariff exemptions and buying US goods as a sweetener for upcoming talks).</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD/CAD -</strong> All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with Cable forming multiple/lower peaks ahead of 1.2400 and reported stops at 1.2385+ and the Aussie fading into 0.6900 and the 100 DMA at 0.6907 following another downbeat sentiment survey overnight (Westpac consumer confidence turned negative). However, the Pound has not seen much angst in wake of an official ruling in Scotland against UK PM Johnson’s Parliament prorogation, while Aud/Usd is still outpacing Nzd/Usd as the latter remains heavy on the 0.6400 handle and the Kiwi struggles to stay above 1.0700 in cross terms ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI tomorrow and Westpac’s Q3 consumer survey on Friday. Elsewhere, the Loonie is maintaining its post-Canadian jobs momentum, but finding 1.3150 a tough hurdle to overcome convincingly.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK -</strong> Even though crude prices remain on a roll and the Norges Bank is still on course to take another step towards policy normalisation before the Riksbank (albeit not likely next week given yesterday’s soft inflation data), Eur/Nok is hovering around 9.8850 within a 9.9010-9.8765 range in contrast to Eur/Sek nearer the base of 10.6990-6595 parameters in wake of latest Riksbank comments reaffirming tightening guidance and dismissing weaker than expected Swedish CPI/CPIF metrics.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Rand’s bull run has been derailed around 14.6100 vs the Dollar and a deterioration in SA business confidence has hardly helped as Usd/Zar rebounds to 14.7000+, even though Moody’s indicated low risk of a ratings downgrade this year.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries:</p><p>- EUR/USD: <strong>1.0990-1.1000 (1.3BLN),</strong> 1.1050 (414M)</p><p>Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence (Sep) -1.7% (Prev. 3.6%). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It was looking ominous when Bunds pierced yesterday’s Eurex low, Fib support and the next downside chart level to trade at 173.65, but alongside Eurozone debt counterparts the ensuing bounce has been pretty pronounced if not encouraging or compelling. Indeed, the 10 year benchmark just reached 174.07 (+9 ticks vs -33 ticks at one stage) before waning vs Gilts that remain 35 ticks adrift, albeit off a 131.99 Liffe base (-59 ticks) and US Treasuries still soft/steeper, though also above overnight session troughs with the curve not as steep as it has been. Perhaps more pre-ECB positioning has prompted the turnaround, but more immediately US PPI forms a precursor for CPI on Thursday and 10 year supply comes with a bit more of a concession at 1.70%+ after last night’s rather tepid 3 year sale.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures</strong> are holding onto most of its intra-day gains/consolidation following yesterday’s decline which was induced by the EIA cutting its 2019 and 2020 global oil demand forecasts by 100k BPD and 30k BPD, whilst downside was exacerbated after US President Trump fired the White House National Security Advisor/known policy-hawk Bolton. Prices have rebounded and remain on an upward trajectory thus far with WTI futures around the 58.00/bbl mark whilst its Brent counterpart trades just under 63.00/bbl (at time of writing). This morning also saw the release of the OPEC Monthly Oil Report in which its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast was revised lower by 80k BPD, in-fitting with the EIA STEO, next up IEA will release its report tomorrow at 0900BST. Ahead of tomorrow’s JMMC meeting, the Iraqi Oil Minister noted that the producers will have a discussion on whether or not there is the need for a deeper production cut with OPEC+, although this was rebuffed by the Russian Energy Minister who also expressed concern regarding global economy. Novak added that the slowing global demand for oil will also be discussed at the meeting tomorrow. Elsewhere<strong>, gold prices</strong> remain capped below the 1500/oz ahead of this week’s key risk events including US CPI and the ECB rate decision, whilst copper prices are little changed with little by way of immediate catalyst.

Eur/Gbp selling into the early 9 am fix may also have impacted, as the cross retests recent sub-0.8925 lows, but Eur/Usd is holding around the 10 DMA and bids said to be sitting just below (at 1.1022 and 1.1020 respectively) with one eye on Thursday’s ECB meeting and some form of easing/stimulus as German institutes continue to downgrade GDP estimates, while the other keeps tabs on higher global bond yields/spreads.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong> - More safe-haven unwinding has nudged the Yen and Franc down to circa 107.85 and 0.9940 vs the Buck, and Usd/Jpy has breached a Fib, exporter offers plus a cloud top formation in the process, at 107.49, 107.50 and 107.71, with some fundamental/macro impetus stemming from another upturn in US Treasury yields and more curve steepening against the backdrop of positive-looking US-China trade headlines (such as Chinese tariff exemptions and buying US goods as a sweetener for upcoming talks).</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD/CAD</strong> - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with Cable forming multiple/lower peaks ahead of 1.2400 and reported stops at 1.2385+ and the Aussie fading into 0.6900 and the 100 DMA at 0.6907 following another downbeat sentiment survey overnight (Westpac consumer confidence turned negative). However, the Pound has not seen much angst in wake of an official ruling in Scotland against UK PM Johnson’s Parliament prorogation, while Aud/Usd is still outpacing Nzd/Usd as the latter remains heavy on the 0.6400 handle and the Kiwi struggles to stay above 1.0700 in cross terms ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI tomorrow and Westpac’s Q3 consumer survey on Friday. Elsewhere, the Loonie is maintaining its post-Canadian jobs momentum, but finding 1.3150 a tough hurdle to overcome convincingly.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong> - Even though crude prices remain on a roll and the Norges Bank is still on course to take another step towards policy normalisation before the Riksbank (albeit not likely next week given yesterday’s soft inflation data), Eur/Nok is hovering around 9.8850 within a 9.9010-9.8765 range in contrast to Eur/Sek nearer the base of 10.6990-6595 parameters in wake of latest Riksbank comments reaffirming tightening guidance and dismissing weaker than expected Swedish CPI/CPIF metrics.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Rand’s bull run has been derailed around 14.6100 vs the Dollar and a deterioration in SA business confidence has hardly helped as Usd/Zar rebounds to 14.7000+, even though Moody’s indicated low risk of a ratings downgrade this year.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It was looking ominous when <strong>Bunds</strong> pierced yesterday’s Eurex low, Fib support and the next downside chart level to trade at 173.65, but alongside Eurozone debt counterparts the ensuing bounce has been pretty pronounced if not encouraging or compelling. Indeed, the 10 year benchmark just reached 174.07 (+9 ticks vs -33 ticks at one stage) before waning vs <strong>Gilts</strong> that remain 35 ticks adrift, albeit off a 131.99 Liffe base (-59 ticks) and US Treasuries still soft/steeper, though also above overnight session troughs with the curve not as steep as it has been. Perhaps more pre-ECB positioning has prompted the turnaround, but more immediately US PPI forms a precursor for CPI on Thursday and 10-year supply comes with a bit more of a concession at 1.70%+ after last night’s rather tepid 3-year sale.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are holding onto most of its intra-day gains/consolidation following yesterday’s decline which was induced by the EIA cutting its 2019 and 2020 global oil demand forecasts by 100k BPD and 30k BPD, whilst downside was exacerbated after US President Trump fired the White House National Security Advisor/known policy-hawk Bolton. Prices have rebounded and remain on an upward trajectory thus far with WTI futures around the 58.00/bbl mark whilst its Brent counterpart trades just under 63.00/bbl (at time of writing). This morning also saw the release of the OPEC Monthly Oil Report in which its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast was revised lower by 80k BPD, in-fitting with the EIA STEO, next up IEA will release its report tomorrow at 0900BST. Ahead of tomorrow’s JMMC meeting, the Iraqi Oil Minister noted that the producers will have a discussion on whether or not there is the need for a deeper production cut with OPEC+, although this was rebuffed by the Russian Energy Minister who also expressed concern regarding global economy. Novak added that the slowing global demand for oil will also be discussed at the meeting tomorrow. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices remain capped below the 1500/oz ahead of this week’s key risk events including US CPI and the ECB rate decision, whilst <strong>copper</strong> prices are little changed with little by way of immediate catalyst. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> ore prices rose for a third session amid a decline in shipments coupled with hopes of further Chinese stimulus.</p>",

Eur/Gbp selling into the early 9 am fix may also have impacted, as the cross retests recent sub-0.8925 lows, but Eur/Usd is holding around the 10 DMA and bids said to be sitting just below (at 1.1022 and 1.1020 respectively) with one eye on Thursday’s ECB meeting and some form of easing/stimulus as German institutes continue to downgrade GDP estimates, while the other keeps tabs on higher global bond yields/spreads.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>More safe-haven unwinding has nudged the Yen and Franc down to circa 107.85 and 0.9940 vs the Buck, and Usd/Jpy has breached a Fib, exporter offers plus a cloud top formation in the process, at 107.49, 107.50 and 107.71, with some fundamental/macro impetus stemming from another upturn in US Treasury yields and more curve steepening against the backdrop of positive-looking US-China trade headlines (such as Chinese tariff exemptions and buying US goods as a sweetener for upcoming talks).</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with Cable forming multiple/lower peaks ahead of 1.2400 and reported stops at 1.2385+ and the Aussie fading into 0.6900 and the 100 DMA at 0.6907 following another downbeat sentiment survey overnight (Westpac consumer confidence turned negative). However, the Pound has not seen much angst in wake of an official ruling in Scotland against UK PM Johnson’s Parliament prorogation, while Aud/Usd is still outpacing Nzd/Usd as the latter remains heavy on the 0.6400 handle and the Kiwi struggles to stay above 1.0700 in cross terms ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI tomorrow and Westpac’s Q3 consumer survey on Friday. Elsewhere, the Loonie is maintaining its post-Canadian jobs momentum, but finding 1.3150 a tough hurdle to overcome convincingly.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Even though crude prices remain on a roll and the Norges Bank is still on course to take another step towards policy normalisation before the Riksbank (albeit not likely next week given yesterday’s soft inflation data), Eur/Nok is hovering around 9.8850 within a 9.9010-9.8765 range in contrast to Eur/Sek nearer the base of 10.6990-6595 parameters in wake of latest Riksbank comments reaffirming tightening guidance and dismissing weaker than expected Swedish CPI/CPIF metrics.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand’s bull run has been derailed around 14.6100 vs the Dollar and a deterioration in SA business confidence has hardly helped as Usd/Zar rebounds to 14.7000+, even though Moody’s indicated low risk of a ratings downgrade this year.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed following the indecisive performance on Wall St amid a continued global bond rout and tentativeness ahead of this week's ECB. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) are higher but with gains in Australia capped as outperformance in mining names is counterbalanced by weakness in tech, while Tokyo exporters continue to reap the benefits of recent currency weakness and after source reports suggested BoJ policymakers could be open to additional easing measures. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are mixed after a tepid PBoC liquidity effort and as the mainland fails to take impetus from China’s fresh efforts to further open its financial markets by dropping QFII and RQFII quota limits. In addition, White House Trade Adviser Navarro suggested investors play the long game regarding China and although sources noted China is ready to sweeten a deal by buying US goods, the reports added that a purchase agreement is no certainty and would be in exchange for a delay on tariffs as well as an easing of restrictions on Huawei.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat as price action remains contained within this week’s tight range with the Fed on a blackout period and amid a lack of significant releases prior to tomorrow’s inflation data. The greenback’s major counterparts are also uneventful with EUR/USD stuck around 1.1050 as markets await the upcoming ECB meeting where markets are fully pricing in a 10bps cut into deeper negative territory for the Deposit Rate and with many expecting a package of measures, although sources have suggested there could be a delay of the launch of QE and there was strong disagreement over how much stimulus was required. GBP/USD trades sideways at the mid-1.2300 handle with Parliament suspended and PM Johnson reiterating he will not negotiate a Brexit delay in Brussels on October 17th-18th. Elsewhere, USD/JPY continues its gradual advances amid gains in Japanese stocks and with focus centred around today’s Cabinet reshuffle, while antipodeans are indecisive with early weakness in AUD amid weaker Westpac Consumer Confidence and as NAB added to its RBA rate cut forecasts in which it now sees the Cash Rate Target lowered to 0.50% by February 2020 vs. Prev. forecast of 0.75%.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid a continuation of the global bond rout which was partly attributed to this week's supply and heavy corporate issuances, while participants are also sidelined ahead of today’s 5yr JGB auction.</p>",
