The Fed also lowered the IOER by 30bps to 1.8% from 2.1% in which the spread from the top of the target range was widened to 20bps from 15bps and it set the offering rate for overnight repos at 1.7% (5bps below bottom of FFR). (Newswires)</p><p>Dot Plots: 2019: 1.9% (Prev. 2.4%), 2020: 1.9% (Prev. 2.1%), 2021: 2.1% (Prev. 2.4%), 2022: 2.4%, long-run: 2.5% (Prev. 2.5%).</p><p>Fed projections showed no further cuts in 2019 although 7 of the 17 policymakers saw one more cut as appropriate, while it stated that it will continue reinvesting principal payments from its portfolio holdings and reiterated to monitor incoming information as well as act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Fed also reiterated the labour market remains strong and economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate, that household spending is rising at a strong pace but business and fixed investment has weakened, while inflation is running below 2%.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell said they lowered rates to maintain strong economy and provide insurance against risks, while he suggested slower global growth and trade tensions with trade policy tensions \"waxed and waned\". Powell added there have been additional weakness abroad and trade tensions since the last meeting which the Fed takes into account but noted that job gains have remained solid in recent months in which it initially expected some slowing.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell said he sees modest changes to federal funds rate in coming years but noted the Fed is not on a pre-set course, while he also suggested that money market issues this week have no implications for stance of monetary policy and economy. Powell added that temporary overnight measures were effective, that they will conduct operations as necessary to ensure interest rates stay in the target range and will provide sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent use of the measures is not necessary.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell said he has always said the level of reserves needed is uncertain, that there is real uncertainty and it is certainly possible the Fed will have to raise balance sheet earlier than thought, while he stated they are prepared to be aggressive if it becomes appropriate, and if Fed was at the zero lower bound again, he does not believe it will implement negative interest rates.</p><p>Note: There was two-way action after the decision, but ultimately, the decision has been framed as hawkish given the dots which showed the median view for no further rate cuts this year or next, and the long-run dot was left unchanged at 2.5%. In addition, there was no mention of liquidity operations and the language on the economy was not downgraded, which resulted to pressure in T-notes and strength in the DXY, while stocks initially declined but then rebounded amid the presser.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>UK and Ireland have opened a back channel for talks on alternatives to the Irish backstop.

Adobe (ADBE) was also lower after earnings; the co beat on the top and bottom-line, however, cut its FY Digital Experience books bookings forecast, and Q4 revenue view was slightly beneath street estimates. General Mills (GIS) had a bumpy ride on Wednesday as participants digested a mixed earnings report which saw an EPS beat and revenues miss expectations. Apple (AAPL) had a positive mention at Wedbush, which said the iPhone 11 launch units could exceed 75mln, citing strong China demand which may aid total iPhone sales exceed 185mln units next year (in contrast to Rosenblatt’s call on Monday, where it saw pre-orders for the iPhone 11 down between 15-20% vs iPhone XS orders in 2018). Western Union (WU) firmed as Amazon (AMZN) announced Amazon Cash was now available in over 100,000 cash loading locations in the US, it allows customers to pay cash for their purchases at 15,000 Western Union (WU) locations. AMD (AMD) was lower after reports suggested it could face a chip shortage as TSMC (TSM) announced the extension of lead time for its 7nm chip capacity to account for the strong demand it is seeing. Roku (ROKU) were lower after Comcast (CMCSA) announced it will give a free streaming box to its internet only subscribers. S&amp;P 500 0% at 3007, NASDAQ-100 0% at 7889, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27147.</p><p>Major curve spreads have narrowed, the front end of the Treasury curve is negative, 7s are flat, and 10s and 30s are higher, at settlement. The Fed delivered a hawkish rate cut, where policymakers are clearly split on the view of the trajectory of rates. Additionally, there was some disappointment that the FOMC did not unveil a fresh liquidity programme in wake of this week's funding squeeze. Earlier, the Fed conducted another repo operation, but unlike Monday's operation, there was over USD 80bln of demand for an allocation if USD 75bln, indicating there was more demand than Monday (where USD 53bln was allotted), signalling that there may be liquidity stress beyond Treasury settlement and corporate tax payments. Powell noted that the funding pressures were elevated but had no implications on monetary policy or the economic outlook. He pledged that the Fed would provide sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent use of such measures were not necessary. He did say that there was uncertainty, and it was certainly possible that the Fed will have to organically grow the balance sheet earlier than thought. But, for the foreseeable future, the Fed will look at temporary market operations to deal with the liquidity crunch. T-note futures (Z9) settled 3+ ticks higher at 129-12+.</p>",

        "subject": "BCB PRIMER: Brazilian Central Bank expected to cut its Selic rate by 50bp for the second consecutive meeting taking it to 5.5%",
        "content": "<p>The Brazilian Central Bank is expected to cut rates by 50bp on Wednesday at 22:00 BST/17:00 ET, taking the Selic rate to 5.5%, which would take the aggregate two meeting easing to 100bps, following the previous decision, where the BCB exceeded expectations for a 25bp cut, unanimously agreeing to lower rates by 50bps. Analysts at Rabobank are in line with the consensus view, and look for the BCB's communications to remain largely unchanged. Recent commentary from BCB chief Campos Neto have been rather cautious, stating the economy warrants stimulative monetary policy, and the increasingly benign inflation outlook should allow for additional stimulus. CPI M/M remained unchanged for August at 0.11% and Y/Y was relatively unchanged at 3.43% (Prev. 3.44%). Therefore, inflation remains well below the BCB’s target of 4.25%, with the latest Focus survey showing the average 2019 inflation forecast at 3.59%, lower than the prior 3.65%; 2020 inflation forecasts also expected at 3.6%, signalling inflation will take some time to return to target. On growth, Neto was very dovish, mentioning it is highly probable that growth will be revised lower, yet again and the short-term outlook is benign. On the global front Neto has expressed doubts to whether developed countries will have the tools to deal with downward global pressures. However, recent GDP was solid as Q/Q printed 0.4%, exceeding expectations for a 0.2% gain, and up from the prior slowdown of -0.2%; Y/Y rose to 1% from 0.5%, (Exp. 0.7%). However, rate cut expectations have been somewhat tempered last week, after data showed private consumption is holding up well (decent retail sales in July), and the labour market is improving too - all of which suggests that the Brazilian economy got off to a solid start in Q3, and perhaps lessening the need for a 50bps cut (although money markets are still priced for -50bps). Nevertheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that consumer confidence remains low, and consumers are expected to remain cautious in the near-term. \"The strength of July's report will not prevent the COPOM from easing further,\" the consultancy writes, \"as other key economic sectors are still under strain, particularly industry which continues to struggle on the back of external and specific domestic shocks,\" and moreover, \"the BRL has performed well this month, giving some leeway to policymakers.\" Looking ahead, money markets have currently priced around 80bps of easing through the end of the year.</p>",

The decision saw hawkish dissent from Rosengren and George (again), while Bullard made the case for a 50bps rate cut. The IOER was cut to 1.8% from 2.1%, and the spread from the top of the target range was widened to 20bps from 15bps. Dots were lowered, but the Committee median sees no further rate cuts this year or next, and the long-run dot was left unchanged at 2.5%. The Fed maintained language that inflation was “muted”, the labour market is still judged as “strong”, the Fed kept its pledge to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion”. However, its view of business investment and exports was downgraded, though it upgraded its assessment of consumer spending. There was no mention in the statement about new liquidity operations. There was two-way action after the decision, but ultimately, the decision has been framed as hawkish (given the dots, and no mention of liquidity operations, while the language on the economy was not downgraded), which has seen equities sell off slightly, and T-Notes come off highs, while the DXY strengthened to 98.55. All eyes on Powell at the bottom of the hour.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESSER:</strong> Powell suggested the rate cut was a continuation of the insurance rate cuts. The Fed chair also retained an upbeat view of the economy, saying that the baseline scenario was still positive, he did not see a recession, and he sees only modest changes to rates in the years ahead, but emphasise that Fed was not on a pre-set course, and will look at the full range of information meeting-by-meeting, and act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. He did suggest that a sequence of rate cuts might be needed if the economy turns, but he did not see that now. But he did take time to note that business investment was weaker due to slower growth abroad and trade tensions. And he noted that the Fed has seen additional weakness abroad since the last FOMC that present risks to the outlook. One key observation was Powell's constant reference to 'uncertainties' stemming from trade. He said that the Fed looks through volatility from trade policy, and reacts to underlying economic conditions. Powell warned that inflation below target might pull expectations lower. On this week's liquidity squeeze, Powell noted that the funding pressures were elevated, but had no implications on monetary policy or the economic outlook. He pledged that the Fed would provide sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent use of such measures were not necessary. He did say that there was uncertainty, and it was certainly possible that the Fed will have to organically grow the balance sheet earlier than thought. But, for the foreseeable future, the Fed will look at temporary market operations to deal with the liquidity crunch (note: the lack of announcement on new liquidity measures has disappointed some participants).</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-12+. </strong>Major curve spreads have narrowed, the front end of the Treasury curve is negative, 7s are flat, and 10s and 30s are higher, at settlement. The Fed delivered a hawkish rate cut, where policymakers are clearly split on the view of the trajectory of rates. Additionally, there was some disappointment that the FOMC did not unveil a fresh liquidity programme in wake of this week's funding squeeze. Earlier, the Fed conducted another repo operation, but unlike Monday's operation, there was over USD 80bln of demand for an allocation if USD 75bln, indicating there was more demand than Monday (where USD 53bln was allotted), signalling that there may be liquidity stress beyond Treasury settlement and corporate tax payments. Powell noted that the funding pressures were elevated but had no implications on monetary policy or the economic outlook. He pledged that the Fed would provide sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent use of such measures were not necessary. He did say that there was uncertainty, and it was certainly possible that the Fed will have to organically grow the balance sheet earlier than thought. But, for the foreseeable future, the Fed will look at temporary market operations to deal with the liquidity crunch.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US President Trump instructed the Treasury to substantially increase sanctions on Iran, saying his decision not to strike Iran previously was a sign of strength, and it was very easy to attack. This is a notably softer retaliation than some had feared, with sources originally suggesting military/cyber intervention of some form was on the cards, and given Iran is already subject to substantial sanctions, more sanctions would likely be ineffective, both in their ability to materially worsen Iran's economy and in their ability to pile further pressure on the country to come to the negotiating table. US Secretary of State Pompeo, who was in Saudi, said the Aramco attacks came from the Iranians, not the Yemen Houthis, adding that the intelligence community has high confidence the weapons were not those which the Houthis owned, and were systems that Iran has not ever deployed outside of its own country. Saudi Defence Ministry spoke before Pompeo, in a similar vein, saying the Aramco attacks showed evidence which it claims proves Iran was behind the attacks, based on factors such as debris, drones, and cruise missiles that were Iranian, Saudi also said the evidence showed the attacks couldn’t have been fired from Yemen as they came from a Northern location, but further investigations are being conducted to find the exact source. Yemen’s Houthis later reiterated that they were behind the attacks and threatening that UAE remains a target, in addition to labelling US Satellite imagery as fake. It was also later reported that – according to a source cited by Independent Arabia - Saudi bombed Iranian militia in Syria on Tuesday, leaving several casualties, although details remain thin.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 1.23 LOWER AT USD 58.11/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES USD0.93 LOWER AT USD 63.60/BBL: </strong>Energy futures sold off for a second consecutive day amid Trump refraining from a military intervention in the Middle East, on top of rising US energy inventories. Benchmarks legged lower as Trump announced he would be ramping up tariffs on Iran, a relatively dovish retaliation. IEA Chief Birol calmed supply concerns saying that the IEA is ready to take any action if it is necessary, but the market is well supplied with enough stocks to offset a significant disruption and does not see the need for stock releases at this moment. Not providing any tailwinds to the energy complex was the latest EIA inventory report, showing a surprise build in crude stocks of 1.1mln barrels (larger than the API reported build, too), distillates and gasoline stocks also posted builds with refinery utilisation falling more than expected at -3.9%, indicative of softer end user demand. Elsewhere in the report, net imports rose by 446k BPD to 3.88mln BPD; US production remained unchanged at 12.4mln BPD</p><p><strong>* US AUGUST HOUSING STARTS/BUILDING PERMITS:</strong> US Building Permits came in at 1.419mln in August (expected 1.3mln against a previous 1.317mln); housing starts came in at 1.364mln (against an expected 1.25mln, and a previous revised 1.215mln). Starts is now at the strongest pace since June 2007; permits came in at the strongest volume of issuance since May 2007. \"The August data are encouraging, but we are not forecasting a surge in new construction in the months ahead,\" Oxford Economics said, \"homebuilders are optimistic, but they continue to face headwinds, including supply-side constraints and some slippage in demand in areas of the country most impacted by the trade war with China.\"</p><p><strong>* CANADA JULY CPI: </strong>Canada CPI fell 0.1% M/M, in line with the consensus, which weighed on the Y/Y rate, which fell to 1.9% from 2.0% prior. An average of the three BOC inflation measures fell by 3bps in the month to 2.0%. The data was driven by cheaper gasoline prices offsetting an increase in natgas prices. Canadian bank RBC notes that underlying inflation continues to hum along at 2.0%, making the BOC the envy of its global peers. \"With the Fed set to lower borrowing costs again today (and potentially leave the door open to another cut) the BOC might just end the year with the highest policy rate in the G7,\" RBC writes, \"inflation would be a key reason for that.\" The bank says that, for consumers, the combination of steady inflation and accelerating wage growth is good news, though there are other pressures, like housing affordability, which is not captured well in the CPI, so not all households will be feeling an increase in purchasing power. Meanwhile, the bank says that geopolitical events have been in focus this week and could have implications for CPI in the months ahead. \"An attack on a major oil process facility in Saudi Arabia over the weekend drove a sharp increase in global oil prices on Monday,\" and \"while a larger risk premium is likely to be embedded in oil prices going forward, about half of the immediate increase in crude prices has now been retraced.\" RBC says that the situation remains fluid, but for now it looks like consumers are not staring down the sharp increase in gasoline prices that was feared earlier this week.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB's de Guindos echoed Draghi, saying monetary policy cannot be the only tool to revive the economy; sees economic risks tilted to the downside. De Cos added that the recent measures by the ECB's governing council will boost economic activity in the Eurozone, and help inflation move back towards the central bank's target; he did, however, warn that there was risks of an imminent recession in some Eurozone countries, which was a slightly stronger line than Draghi pushed last week.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> S&amp;P 500 0% at 3007, NASDAQ-100 0% at 7889, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27147</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.1%, Consumer Staples 0%, Energy -0.4%, Financials 0.4%, Health Care 0%, Industrials-0.1%, Information Technology 0.1%, Materials 0.1%, Telecommunication Services -0.1%, Utilities 0.5%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: FedEx (FDX) weighed on the industrial sector, underperforming following poor earnings and a trim in its guidance, citing a decline in the macroeconomic outlook. Adobe (ADBE) was also lower after earnings; the co beat on the top and bottom-line, however, cut its FY Digital Experience books bookings forecast, and Q4 revenue view was slightly beneath street estimates. General Mills (GIS) had a bumpy ride on Wednesday as participants digested a mixed earnings report which saw an EPS beat and revenues miss expectations. Apple (AAPL) had a positive mention at Wedbush, which said the iPhone 11 launch units could exceed 75mln, citing strong China demand which may aid total iPhone sales exceed 185mln units next year (in contrast to Rosenblatt’s call on Monday, where it saw pre-orders for the iPhone 11 down between 15-20% vs iPhone XS orders in 2018). Western Union (WU) firmed as Amazon (AMZN) announced Amazon Cash was now available in over 100,000 cash loading locations in the US, it allows customers to pay cash for their purchases at 15,000 Western Union (WU) locations. AMD (AMD) was lower after reports suggested it could face a chip shortage as TSMC (TSM) announced the extension of lead time for its 7nm chip capacity to account for the strong demand it is seeing. Roku (ROKU) were lower after Comcast (CMCSA) announced it will give a free streaming box to its internet only subscribers.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD:</strong> a hawkish FOMC rate cut supported the dollar, though the DXY came off highs after Powell spoke at length about uncertainties stemming from trade policy. <strong>HAVENS: </strong>JPY traded relatively rangebound, however the hawkish cut saw USDJPY strength pushing USDJPY to seven week highs, testing 108.50 again. Following the rate decision US yields rose, therefore rate differentials also likely played a part, all ahead of tonight’s BoJ decision, where nothing much is expected. <strong>XAU </strong>traded sideways throughout the session until the much awaited FOMC, where futures sold off breaching 1500/oz to the downside. <strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling fell after CPI data missed to the downside in August, giving the BOE less scope to talk-up tighter policy at Thursday's MPC. The weakness was broad, with headline, core and services (the latter key, given the UK's services economy) all falling.&nbsp; <strong>NOK:</strong> Some still look for the Norges Bank to hike on Thursday - not consensus, but there are still risks it reiterates a hawkish stance. <strong>NOK</strong> traded with similar moves to oil today which carried on its decline. <strong>AUD</strong> saw downside in wake of the Fed’s hawkish cut; overnight, attention will be on the jobs data; <strong>NZD</strong> will be awaiting GDP data overnight. <strong>CAD</strong> strengthened after inflation data, however, could not retain gains amid weaker oil prices and a stronger USD.</p><p>* <strong>BOE PREVIEW: </strong>Policymakers are once again expected to stand pat on rates at 0.75% as the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU remains unclear and thus restrains the ability of the MPC to act. The Bank continues to guide towards “gradual and limited” rate rises, however, market pricing shows more of a bias towards cuts rather than hikes at the Bank with just over 13bps of loosening priced in by August of next year. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22799/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* BOJ PREVIEW: </strong>The Bank of Japan will conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Thursday where the central bank is expected to keep all monetary policy settings unchanged with NIRP at -0.1% and QQE with yield curve control to target 10yr JGB yields at around 0%. The BoJ is also anticipated to maintain its forward guidance of keeping rates at extremely low levels at least through to Spring 2020<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22800/download\">. Click here to read full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* SNB PREVIEW: </strong>Consensus is for the SNB to leave rates unchanged at -0.75%, with 26/37 economists surveyed by Reuters in favour of no move. The remaining 11 expect a cut with six calling for a 25bp reduction, one calling for 20bp and four seeing a 10bp rate cut. Note, this meeting does not include a press conference after the rate decision. Looking ahead, Morgan Stanley (that forecasts a 25bps cut this week) see scope for further dovish rate moves in subsequent meetings, although this is likely to be accompanied by an alteration to the tiering policy in order to mitigate the impact of further negative rates. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22804/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* NORGES PREVIEW: </strong>Expectations for the meeting are split between the Norges Bank leaving rates unchanged at 1.25% or completing their hiking cycle via a 25bp move; a recent Reuters survey noted that 15/29 polled economists see a hike with the remainder predicting unchanged rates. Note, this meeting includes an updated Financial Stability Assessment and a press conference at 09:30BST. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22803/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* BCB PREVIEW: </strong>The Brazilian Central Bank is expected to cut rates by 50bp on Wednesday at 22:00 BST/17:00 ET, taking the Selic rate to 5.5%, which would take the aggregate two meeting easing to 100bps, following the previous decision, where the BCB exceeded expectations for a 25bp cut, unanimously agreeing to lower rates by 50bps. Analysts at Rabobank are in line with the consensus view, and look for the BCB's communications to remain largely unchanged. Recent commentary from BCB chief Campos Neto have been rather cautious, stating the economy warrants stimulative monetary policy, and the increasingly benign inflation outlook should allow for additional stimulus. CPI M/M remained unchanged for August at 0.11% and Y/Y was relatively unchanged at 3.43% (Prev. 3.44%). Therefore, inflation remains well below the BCB’s target of 4.25%, with the latest Focus survey showing the average 2019 inflation forecast at 3.59%, lower than the prior 3.65%; 2020 inflation forecasts also expected at 3.6%, signalling inflation will take some time to return to target. On growth, Neto was very dovish, mentioning it is highly probable that growth will be revised lower, yet again and the short-term outlook is benign. On the global front Neto has expressed doubts to whether developed countries will have the tools to deal with downward global pressures. However, recent GDP was solid as Q/Q printed 0.4%, exceeding expectations for a 0.2% gain, and up from the prior slowdown of -0.2%; Y/Y rose to 1% from 0.5%, (Exp. 0.7%). However, rate cut expectations have been somewhat tempered last week, after data showed private consumption is holding up well (decent retail sales in July), and the labour market is improving too - all of which suggests that the Brazilian economy got off to a solid start in Q3, and perhaps lessening the need for a 50bps cut (although money markets are still priced for -50bps). Nevertheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that consumer confidence remains low, and consumers are expected to remain cautious in the near-term. \"The strength of July's report will not prevent the COPOM from easing further,\" the consultancy writes, \"as other key economic sectors are still under strain, particularly industry which continues to struggle on the back of external and specific domestic shocks,\" and moreover, \"the BRL has performed well this month, giving some leeway to policymakers.\" Looking ahead, money markets have currently priced around 80bps of easing through the end of the year.</p><p><strong>* SARB PREVIEW: </strong>EXPECTATIONS: 80% of desks polled by Reuters expect the SARB to stand pat on rates on 18 September, while there is a minority view for a 25bps cut. At the previous meeting in July, SARB policy makers cut rates by 25bps to 6.5%, emphasised that they wanted CPI to stay at roughly 4.5% and warned of the continued presence of upside risks to inflation (which some desks took as a warning over the possibility of a ZAR sell off on Eskom, fiscal, or credit rating related risks). In his most recent comments, Governor Kganyago was upbeat on the economy, pointing to the strong rebound in Q2 GDP growth and noted that two of the key risks identified at the previous meeting (exchange rate and oil prices) have “behaved”. It is worth noting that since these comments, crude prices have seen significant volatility on the recent escalation of Middle Eastern tensions. Those in favour of a rate cut may highlight recent data, pointing to recent soft inflation; August CPI came 4.3%, below the midpoint of the SARB 3-6% target range (but did jump from the 4.0% prior). They may also cite stagnant GDP growth; although Q2’s Q/Q GDP growth came in at a solid 3.1%, many sectors in the economy are in contractionary territory, as shown in July’s weak manufacturing PMI, while the SARB looks for growth of just 0.6% this year. Retail sales for July came in at 2.0%, below expectations for 2.6% and down from the prior 2.4%. Though the data may, on the face of it, suggest there is space for further easing, policy makers may argue the limited ability of rate cuts to stimulate growth; as the SARB has long argued, South Africa requires structural changes to drive the country out of its low-growth trap. Moreover, policy makers may want to maintain a favourable real policy rate buffer both to keep its powder dry and to keep an attractive real interest rate relative to its EM peers, which members could argue can attract investment and promote domestic financial stability. Finally, they may express concern about the recent pick-up in exchange rate volatility since the recent escalation in US/China trade tensions in early August.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Fed chair also retained an upbeat view of the economy, saying that the baseline scenario was still positive, he did not see a recession, and he sees only modest changes to rates in the years ahead, but emphasies that Fed was not on a pre-set course, and will look at the full range of information meeting-by-meeting, and act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. He did suggest that a sequence of rate cuts might be needed if the economy turns, but he did not see that now. But he did take time to note that business investment was weaker due to slower growth abroad and trade tensions. And he noted that the Fed has seen additional weakness abroad since the last FOMC that present risks to the outlook. One key observation was Powell's constant reference to 'uncertainties' stemming from trade. He said that the Fed looks through volatility from trade policy, and reacts to underlying economic conditions. Powell warned that inflation below target might pull expectations lower.

Not providing any tailwinds to the energy complex was the latest EIA inventory report, showing a surprise build in crude stocks of 1.1mln barrels (larger than the API reported build, too), distillates and gasoline stocks also posted builds with refinery utilisation falling more than expected at -3.9%, indicative of softer end user demand. Elsewhere in the report, net imports rose by 446k BPD to 3.88mln BPD; US production remained unchanged at 12.4mln BPD.</li></ul>",

The IOER was cut to 1.8% from 2.1%, and the spread from the top of the target range was widened to 20bps from 15bps. Dots were lowered, but the Committee median sees no further rate cuts this year or next, and the long-run dot was left unchanged at 2.5%. The Fed maintained language that inflation was “muted”, the labour market is still judged as “strong”, the Fed kept its pledge to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion”. However, its view of business investment and exports was downgraded, though it&nbsp; upgraded its assessment of consumer spending. There was no mention in the statement about new liquidity operations. There was two-way action after the decision, but ultimately, the decision has been framed as hawkish (given the dots, and no mention of liquidity operations, while the language on the economy was not downgraded), which has seen equities sell off slightly, and T-Notes come off highs, while the DXY strengthened to 98.55. All eyes on Powell at the bottom of the hour.</p>",

The meeting will feature updated economic forecasts, which are not expected to be tweaked significantly; the updated ‘dot plot’ will likely see the rate path lowered; fed funds futures currently see 100bps of rate cuts over the Fed’s forecast horizon. Markets will be looking for guidance on how much further the Fed will cut rates; Powell is expected to reiterate the Fed’s optionality to act if needed, and is likely to retain his upbeat tone on the US economy, while cognizant of the inflation and international risks. Rate decision and projections is scheduled for 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 18th&nbsp;September 2019; press conference with Chair Powell scheduled for 1930 BST/1430 EDT. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/22790/download\"><strong>here</strong></a></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

We have provided a primer on repos below for your information:</p><p><strong>STANDING REPO FACILITY (SRF)/PERMA OPEN MARKET OPS (POMO)/BALANCE SHEET:</strong></p><p><strong>* SRF/POMO: </strong>Will the Fed formalise its SRF at September meeting? Or offer a roadmap? Likely the latter since the purpose of the facility has not been defined. What’s the motivation? Capping repo rates? Reducing demand for excess reserves?</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK:</strong> The Fed responded to money market stress with repo operations. Size was relatively small (USD 53bln of USD 75bln offered, and the operation pushed rates all the way to zero), suggesting no structural/systemic factors in play (from a more global perspective, EMFX also did not see any significant spill over). Commonly cited factors were Treasury settlements, and corporate tax paying, while previously month/quarter end has played a role. Does the Fed think reserve scarcity is playing a role? Wednesday's operation, however, was oversubscribed, suggesting funding pressures remain, and crucially, some think the oversubscription is indicative of structural issues.</p><p><strong>* RESERVES: </strong>Is the Fed going to stop shrinking reserves? (Even with ending B/S drawdown, reserves are still shrinking since they are kept constant while the currency base is growing). Will the Fed now be growing its balance sheet? To stop reserve draws, Fed would need at minimum need to buy assets in secondary markets to match the growth of currency.</p><p><strong>* REPO RATE: </strong>What would the rate be? Top end of FFR target range? Or above the range? (if so, by what margin?).</p><p><strong>* COUNTERPARTIES: </strong>Will counterparties be just primary dealers? Or will the Fed line up other counterparties (expanding counterparties to over month/quarter-end in case dealers cannot intermediate).</p><p><strong>* BACKGROUND:</strong> SRF was discussed in June meeting minutes. Some participants raised questions about whether such a facility is needed in an ample-reserves framework, noting that the current ample-reserves regime has provided good interest rate control; this week's events indicate there is a need for the facility.</p><p>* <strong>ISSUES:</strong> must guard against unintended consequences, including the potential for moral hazard or a more volatile Fed balance sheet. Are there other tools/initiatives better suited to achieve the Fed's desired goals? Several participants have noted that a facility could possibly aid with multiple policy objectives.</p><p><strong>* IOER: </strong>This week's funding squeeze lowers the bar for an IOER cut (which would be the fourth time in the last two years) from the current 2.10%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Not much additional movement in Usd/major pairings and thus the index overall that is holding within a slightly extended 98.505-197 range and could have marked out its stall into the FOMC, updates SEP and post-meeting press conference from Chair Powell that will embellish guidance contained in the accompanying statement. Consensus remains in favour of another 25 bp ease after July’s ¼ point reduction, albeit much less one-sided than it has been via some measures of market expectations as ongoing tightness in repo funding skews near term Fed pricing. Note, a full preview of the eagerly awaited risk event is available via the Ransquawk Research Suite and closer to policy announcement time.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars have been lagging most other G10s all day and remain on the backfoot following more US-Iran accusations and denials over the Saudi oil attacks that have culminated in President Trump instructing the Treasury to significantly raise the level of sanctions against Tehran. Meanwhile, Westpac’s Leading Index turned negative and NZ Q2 current account data was mixed ahead of the GDP prints tonight, leaving Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd around 0.6830 and 0.6330 respectively, while Aud/Nzd straddled the 1.0800 handle.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CAD/GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen has held up relatively well between 108.27-09 vs the Greenback after a smaller than forecast Japanese trade deficit and with the BoJ policy meeting coming hot on the heels of the Fed – primer also posted within our Research Suite. Conversely, the Euro, Loonie, Sterling and Franc have all been more volatile and weaker against the Buck, with the single currency hampered by more downbeat ECB rhetoric (de Guindos reiterating downside growth/inflation risks, and de Cos going further by noting imminent recession threats for some Eurozone member states). Eur/Usd has pivoted 1.1050, like Usd/Cad around 1.3250, Cable encircling 1.2500 and Usd/Chf trading either side of 0.9950, but Eur/Chf mainly firmer on the 1.1000 axis ahead of Thursday’s SNB. Note, the Pound saw some downside following a headline y/y UK CPI miss, albeit marginal and actually above the BoE’s projection, in contrast to the Loonie that was perhaps strangely resilient to a similar Canadian outcome.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are narrowly mixed amidst soft crude prices, downbeat Swedish Finance Ministry commentary vs more confident statements from Riksbank Governor Ingves and pre-Norges Bank positioning with the jury split on whether the Norwegian Central Bank bites the bullet and hikes again or holds fire and risks a missed policy normalisation opportunity – primer on the website. However, Eur/Nok is hugging the base of a 9.8675-9060 band, while Eur/Sek sits closer to the upper end of a 10.7430-7040 range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Real and Rand are also waiting independent Central Bank direction to supplement or supplant Fed-induced moves, as the BCB is expected to cut by a further 50 bp in contrast to a steady SARB. Usd/Brl and Usd/Zar currently around 4.1000 and 14.6400 respectively, with the latter not really reacting to firmer SA inflation data vs consensus or retail sales that were weaker than forecast.</p>",

IBEX 35 (+0.2%) was mildly softer after the open, although has since turned around, amid more political uncertainty, after the King stated there was no candidate for a parliament investiture vote; meaning Spaniards will return to the polls in November for the fourth time in four years. In terms of sector performance; Energy (+0.4%) has managed to shrug off yesterday’s fall in oil prices, while Telecoms (u/c), Consumer Discretionary (-0.4%), Consumer Staples (-0.2%) and Industrials (-0.1%) are the laggards. Luxury names, including Richemont (-4.1%) and Swatch Group (-2.6%), are under pressure after UBS downgraded the sector, with downside in Moncler (-4.5%) exacerbated by cautious comments from the co.’s CEO, who expressed concern about the situation in Hong Kong. In the lead are utilities (+0.4%), with gains in EDF (+3.7%) helping to prop up the sector (the Co. reported weld issues in six reactor units relating to 16 steam generators but does not believe they pose a significant adverse effect now), while materials (+0.2%) and Tech (+0.4%) are also higher. In terms of other notable individual movers; Kingfisher (-2.4%) is lower after sales disappointed (GBP 6.0bln vs. Exp. GBP 6.02bln and like-for-like sales down 1.8%). Elsewhere, Wirecard (+3.1%) took a leg higher on the news that the co. has signed a strategic co-operation agreement with Japan’s Softbank. Finally, Beiersdorf (-1.0%) is under pressure after being downgraded at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The DXY seems to have established a firm base above 98.000 and Fib support just above the big figure, partly due to weakness in the Greenback’s G10 counterparts, but also on the back of recent firmer than forecast US data/surveys, increased demand for short term Usd funds and a marked change in Fed rate expectations going into September’s policy meeting (odds between another 25bp hike and no change much closer to even from around 90% for +1/4 point only a few days ago). The index is currently just shy of 98.500 and considerably closer to nearest resistance (98.744 yesterday) than the aforementioned downside chart retracement level (98.034).</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/AUD - </strong>The major underperformers, with Cable already retreating after another 1.2500+ sortie and failure to sustain gains above the 100 DMA (1.2501) amidst relatively negative Brexit remarks from EU’s Barnier and Juncker, but then extending its pull-back through 1.2450 at one stage in wake of significantly softer than expected UK CPI on the eve of retail sales and the BoE rate convene. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is back under pressure alongside the Aussie after overnight releases showing a decline in Westpac’s LEI and mixed NZ Q2 current account metrics, with Nzd/Usd under 0.6350 again and Aud/Usd sub-0.6850. Note, Aud/Nzd is still pivoting 1.0800 following this week’s dovish RBA minutes and eyeing NZ Q2 GDP later today, while Aud/Usd appears capped by decent upside option expiry interest at 0.6860-65 (1 bn) and 0.6895-0.6900 (2.6 bn).</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/EUR - </strong>Also weaker against their US peer, albeit on a sliding scale as the Yen contains losses over the 108.00 mark with the aid of a narrower than anticipated Japanese trade gap and with expiries also in close proximity (1.1 bn at 108.25-40 and then 1 bn at 108.75 if Tuesday’s multi-week peak and 108.50 are breached) ahead of the FOMC and BoJ tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Loonie has regained some poise and traction having held just above 1.3300 yesterday to meander around 1.3250 awaiting some independent impetus from Canadian CPI in advance of the Fed. Elsewhere, the Franc remains anchored near 0.9950, but has weakened vs the Euro to 1.1000 into the SNB on Thursday even though the single currency has lost momentum against the Buck following another approach towards 1.1100. Indeed, Eur/Usd has pulled back below 1.1050 amidst downbeat commentary from ECB’s de Guindos and the headline pair may gravitate further given more downside option expiry interest compared to upside (1.6 bn at the 1.1000 strike and 1 bn between 1.1020-30 vs 1.7 bn from 1.1100 to 1.1115).</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Rand is also awaiting the Fed before turning attention to tomorrow’s SARB meet, and Usd/Zar has largely taken in stride slightly firmer than forecast SA CPI ahead of retail sales within a 14.7080-6325 band, though mostly trading near the base.</p><p><strong>Notable FX Expiries:</strong></p><p>- EUR/USD: <strong>1.1000 (1.6BLN), 1.1020-30 (1BLN), 1.1100-15 (1.7BLN)</strong></p><p>- GBP/USD: 1.2400 (350M), 1.2460-70 (300M), <strong>1.2530 (500M)</strong></p><p>- AUD/USD<strong>: 0.6860-65 (1BLN), 0.6895-0.6900 (2.6BLN)</strong></p><p>- USD/JPY: 107.50 (700M), 107.65-75 (850M), <strong>108.25-40 (1.1BLN), 108.75 (1BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>UK debt received a marked boost from the softer than expected CPI metrics printing at 1.7% vs. Exp. 1.9% for the headline. Gilts have touched 132.48 at best and surpassed yesterday’s high at 132.27 by a bigger margin. Turning to the core Eurozone bond, only a brief setback after a somewhat unexpectedly poor 30 year German auction given the relatively small EUR 1.5bln offering, better yield environment and impending ECB presence in the market. The disappointing level of demand (barely covered and only fractionally more than when the 2050 issue was launched) may be due to the seemingly growing potential for fiscal stimulus ahead, but Bunds have quickly recovered and continue to hold firm just below a 173.29 high amidst a lack of significant new catalysts and as geopolitical tensions persist. Stateside, USTs are similarly buoyed having touched a high of 129-20+ and with the curve flatter again. Looking ahead, focus is clearly on tonight’s FOMC, and specifically the magnitude of a cut, number of dissenters given Rosengren and George’s opposition last time plus guidance. Pricing for the meeting sees around a 65% chance of a 25bp cut as consensus, with the remainder ascribed to rates being left unchanged; it's worth noting this is not necessarily reflective of 'market expectations' given the recent fed fund activity skewing expectations.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>Major European bourses are flat (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%), following on from a tentative AsiaPac session, amid cautious trade ahead of this evening’s FOMC meeting. IBEX 35 (+0.2%) was mildly softer after the open, although has since turned around, amid more political uncertainty, after the King stated there was no candidate for a parliament investiture vote; meaning Spaniards will return to the polls in November for the fourth time in four years. In terms of sector performance; Energy (+0.4%) has managed to shrug off yesterday’s fall in oil prices, while Telecoms (u/c), Consumer Discretionary (-0.4%), Consumer Staples (-0.2%) and Industrials (-0.1%) are the laggards. Luxury names, including Richemont (-4.1%) and Swatch Group (-2.6%), are under pressure after UBS downgraded the sector, with downside in Moncler (-4.5%) exacerbated by cautious comments from the co.’s CEO, who expressed concern about the situation in Hong Kong. In the lead are utilities (+0.4%), with gains in EDF (+3.7%) helping to prop up the sector (the Co. reported weld issues in six reactor units relating to 16 steam generators but does not believe they pose a significant adverse effect now), while materials (+0.2%) and Tech (+0.4%) are also higher. In terms of other notable individual movers; Kingfisher (-2.4%) is lower after sales disappointed (GBP 6.0bln vs. Exp. GBP 6.02bln and like-for-like sales down 1.8%). Elsewhere, Wirecard (+3.1%) took a leg higher on the news that the co. has signed a strategic co-operation agreement with Japan’s Softbank. Finally, Beiersdorf (-1.0%) is under pressure after being downgraded at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The DXY seems to have established a firm base above 98.000 and Fib support just above the big figure, partly due to weakness in the Greenback’s G10 counterparts, but also on the back of recent firmer than forecast US data/surveys, increased demand for short term Usd funds and a marked change in Fed rate expectations going into September’s policy meeting (odds between another 25bp hike and no change much closer to even from around 90% for +1/4 point only a few days ago). The index is currently just shy of 98.500 and considerably closer to nearest resistance (98.744 yesterday) than the aforementioned downside chart retracement level (98.034).</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/AUD - </strong>The major underperformers, with Cable already retreating after another 1.2500+ sortie and failure to sustain gains above the 100 DMA (1.2501) amidst relatively negative Brexit remarks from EU’s Barnier and Juncker, but then extending its pull-back through 1.2450 at one stage in wake of significantly softer than expected UK CPI on the eve of retail sales and the BoE rate convene. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is back under pressure alongside the Aussie after overnight releases showing a decline in Westpac’s LEI and mixed NZ Q2 current account metrics, with Nzd/Usd under 0.6350 again and Aud/Usd sub-0.6850. Note, Aud/Nzd is still pivoting 1.0800 following this week’s dovish RBA minutes and eyeing NZ Q2 GDP later today, while Aud/Usd appears capped by decent upside option expiry interest at 0.6860-65 (1 bn) and 0.6895-0.6900 (2.6 bn).</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/EUR - </strong>Also weaker against their US peer, albeit on a sliding scale as the Yen contains losses over the 108.00 mark with the aid of a narrower than anticipated Japanese trade gap and with expiries also in close proximity (1.1 bn at 108.25-40 and then 1 bn at 108.75 if Tuesday’s multi-week peak and 108.50 are breached) ahead of the FOMC and BoJ tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Loonie has regained some poise and traction having held just above 1.3300 yesterday to meander around 1.3250 awaiting some independent impetus from Canadian CPI in advance of the Fed. Elsewhere, the Franc remains anchored near 0.9950, but has weakened vs the Euro to 1.1000 into the SNB on Thursday even though the single currency has lost momentum against the Buck following another approach towards 1.1100. Indeed, Eur/Usd has pulled back below 1.1050 amidst downbeat commentary from ECB’s de Guindos and the headline pair may gravitate further given more downside option expiry interest compared to upside (1.6 bn at the 1.1000 strike and 1 bn between 1.1020-30 vs 1.7 bn from 1.1100 to 1.1115).</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Rand is also awaiting the Fed before turning attention to tomorrow’s SARB meet, and Usd/Zar has largely taken in stride slightly firmer than forecast SA CPI ahead of retail sales within a 14.7080-6325 band, though mostly trading near the base.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>UK debt received a marked boost from the softer than expected CPI metrics printing at 1.7% vs. Exp. 1.9% for the headline. Gilts have touched 132.48 at best and surpassed yesterday’s high at 132.27 by a bigger margin. Turning to the core Eurozone bond, only a brief setback after a somewhat unexpectedly poor 30 year German auction given the relatively small EUR 1.5bln offering, better yield environment and impending ECB presence in the market. The disappointing level of demand (barely covered and only fractionally more than when the 2050 issue was launched) may be due to the seemingly growing potential for fiscal stimulus ahead, but Bunds have quickly recovered and continue to hold firm just below a 173.29 high amidst a lack of significant new catalysts and as geopolitical tensions persist. Stateside, USTs are similarly buoyed having touched a high of 129-20+ and with the curve flatter again. Looking ahead, focus is clearly on tonight’s FOMC, and specifically the magnitude of a cut, number of dissenters given Rosengren and George’s opposition last time plus guidance. Pricing for the meeting sees around a 65% chance of a 25bp cut as consensus, with the remainder ascribed to rates being left unchanged; it's worth noting this is not necessarily reflective of 'market expectations' given the recent fed fund activity skewing expectations. Rate decision aside, the NY fed have announced another overnight repo operation to be conducted today given the ongoing or residual liquidity shortage.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>The crude complex is largely in consolidation mode</strong> ahead of key risk events (FOMC) amid a lack of fresh catalysts and following yesterday’s declines, triggered by news that Saudi oil output will return to normal levels faster than originally assumed; Energy Minister Abdulaziz said oil supply is fully back online and resumed as before after more than half the oil output was resumed in the past few days and that it will keep full oil supply to its customers this month.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>seems to have established a firm base above 98.000 and Fib support just above the big figure, partly due to weakness in the Greenback’s G10 counterparts, but also on the back of recent firmer than forecast US data/surveys, increased demand for short term Usd funds and a marked change in Fed rate expectations going into September’s policy meeting (odds between another 25bp hike and no change much closer to even from around 90% for +1/4 point only a few days ago). The index is currently just shy of 98.500 and considerably closer to nearest resistance (98.744 yesterday) than the aforementioned downside chart retracement level (98.034).</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The major underperformers, with Cable already retreating after another 1.2500+ sortie and failure to sustain gains above the 100 DMA (1.2501) amidst relatively negative Brexit remarks from EU’s Barnier and Juncker, but then extending its pull-back through 1.2450 at one stage in wake of significantly softer than expected UK CPI on the eve of retail sales and the BoE rate convene. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is back under pressure alongside the Aussie after overnight releases showing a decline in Westpac’s LEI and mixed NZ Q2 current account metrics, with Nzd/Usd under 0.6350 again and Aud/Usd sub-0.6850. Note, Aud/Nzd is still pivoting 1.0800 following this week’s dovish RBA minutes and eyeing NZ Q2 GDP later today, while Aud/Usd appears capped by decent upside option expiry interest at 0.6860-65 (1 bn) and 0.6895-0.6900 (2.6 bn).</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Also weaker against their US peer, albeit on a sliding scale as the Yen contains losses over the 108.00 mark with the aid of a narrower than anticipated Japanese trade gap and with expiries also in close proximity (1.1 bn at 108.25-40 and then 1 bn at 108.75 if Tuesday’s multi-week peak and 108.50 are breached) ahead of the FOMC and BoJ tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Loonie has regained some poise and traction having held just above 1.3300 yesterday to meander around 1.3250 awaiting some independent impetus from Canadian CPI in advance of the Fed. Elsewhere, the Franc remains anchored near 0.9950, but has weakened vs the Euro to 1.1000 into the SNB on Thursday even though the single currency has lost momentum against the Buck following another approach towards 1.1100. Indeed, Eur/Usd has pulled back below 1.1050 amidst downbeat commentary from ECB’s de Guindos and the headline pair may gravitate further given more downside option expiry interest compared to upside (1.6 bn at the 1.1000 strike and 1 bn between 1.1020-30 vs 1.7 bn from 1.1100 to 1.1115).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand is also awaiting the Fed before turning attention to tomorrow’s SARB meet, and Usd/Zar has largely taken in stride slightly firmer than forecast SA CPI ahead of retail sales within a 14.7080-6325 band, though mostly trading near the base.</p>",

Long end German issuance looms and the 2050 bond was given a wide berth at launch so it will be interesting to see if investors are enticed by the positive yield, and the fact that the ECB plans to start buying debt again.

Finally, 10yr JGBs initially continued to oscillate around the 154.00 level as the BoJ kick-started its 2-day policy meeting, although prices eventually gained traction after tripping stops through this week’s resistance levels and largely ignored the mostly weaker 20yr JGB auction results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos for a net neutral daily position.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded tentative following the cautious gains on Wall St amid positioning heading into a flurry of central bank activity including the FOMC decision where the Fed are expected to deliver a consecutive 25bps cut. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were indecisive ahead of the looming risk events and with Australia subdued by losses in the energy sector after an aggressive pullback in oil prices due to reports Saudi oil output will return to normal levels quicker than initially anticipated, while the Japanese benchmark remained at the whim of a choppy currency amid somewhat inconclusive data which showed Exports contracted for a 9th consecutive month albeit at a narrower than expected decline. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) conformed to the holding pattern seen across regional and global counterparts after the PBoC opted for a net neutral position in its liquidity operations and after President Trump reverted back to a blasé approach on US-China trade in which he suggested a deal could come soon, possibly before the 2020 election or after. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially continued to oscillate around the 154.00 level as the BoJ kick-started its 2-day policy meeting, although prices eventually gained traction after tripping stops through this week’s resistance levels and largely ignored the mostly weaker 20yr JGB auction results.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade tentative following the cautious gains on Wall St amid positioning heading into a flurry of central bank activity including the FOMC decision where the Fed are expected to deliver a consecutive 25bps cut. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) are mixed ahead of the looming risk events and with Australia subdued by losses in the energy sector after an aggressive pullback in oil prices due to reports Saudi oil output will return to normal levels quicker than initially anticipated, while the Japanese benchmark remains afloat on recent JPY weakness but with gains restricted amid inconclusive data which showed Exports contracted for a 9th consecutive month albeit at a narrower than expected decline. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) conform to the holding pattern seen across regional and global counterparts after the PBoC opted for a net neutral position in its liquidity efforts and with President Trump reverting back to a blasé approach on US-China trade in which he suggested a deal could come soon, possibly before the 2020 election or after.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat but remains near the prior day’s lows after the Fed’s unscheduled and first repo operation in a decade as it sought to soothe fears of a liquidity squeeze in the repo market rate in which its actions resulted to about a USD 53.2bln injection into the banking system, while it also announced to conduct another USD 75bln overnight repo later. Nonetheless, focus remains firmly on the upcoming FOMC announcement in which rates are widely expected to be cut again and where participants will also get to mull over the latest dot plot projections, although there has been turbulence in Fed Fund Futures overnight which briefly priced in just a 51% probability for a cut today from a 92% chance a week ago, before rising back to around 62%. EUR/USD trades uneventful as it holds on to the recent gains against the greenback and GBP/USD also consolidates after failing to hold above 1.2500. Elsewhere, USD/JPY has largely reflected the cautious gains in the region, while antipodeans are the regional laggards following a weaker than expected PBoC reference rate setting, as well as lacklustre Australian Westpac Consumer Sentiment and mixed New Zealand Current Account data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher but with gains only modest as prices continue to oscillate around the 154.00 level ahead of a 20yr JGB auction later and with BoJ kick-starting its 2-day policy meeting.</p>",
