The curve bull-flattened, particularly in the front to belly, with the 2s10s narrowing by around 4bps at settlement, and 2s30s narrowing by around 3bps at settlement (taking this week’s 2s30s narrowing to around 8bps).

Traders also noted that it was interesting that, while equities rebounded off of lows from the late European morning onwards, the Treasury space has not done so, with the T-Note only slightly off highs at settlement.</p>",
