Later comments saw him say progress was being made and there was less uncertainty. On the economic outlook, he noted that US job gains show growth momentum heading into 2019, he expects real wage growth to accelerate this year with nominal wage growth above 4%; adding that he sees the jobless rate normalising after the govt shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Brexit news on Monday saw reports early on from an EU official, saying that on the EU&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;nobody is considering&rdquo; legally binding assurances on the Irish backstop and that the EU is right to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Minister threw water over backstop &ldquo;alternative arrangements&rdquo;, saying none of the new ideas stood up to scrutiny. EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier said the EU is ready to work on alternative solutions to the backstop during transition, backstop is only operational solution to Irish border issue today and the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened. On UK turf, conservative lawmakers were said to have had &ldquo;detailed and constructive&rdquo; talks in regard to the backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.70 LOWER AT USD 54.56/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.24 LOWER AT USD 62.51/BBL</strong>. Oil prices reversed course on Monday and dipped into negative territory after hitting a two-month high amid OPEC supply cuts and US sanctions on Venezuela. Today&rsquo;s movement lacks a specific catalyst though analysts have cited unfavourable prospects for the global economy and insufficient progress in trade talks as two potential factors placing downward pressure on the energy complex.&nbsp; In news flow, Head of Russian Finance Ministry stated that Russian oil production has not peaked yet while Russian oil output dropped by 70k BPD in January to 11.38mln BPD from December; Russian Energy Minister Novak noted that the country is fully complying with the conditions of the OPEC+ deal and is committed to reaching output cut target by May. Elsewhere, Venezuelan exports fell to a ten-month low in January at 1.11mln BPD. Looking ahead, this week&rsquo;s energy inventories see crude building 1.6mln barrels, distillates drawing 1.9mln barrels and gasoline building 1.7mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.68% at 2725, NASDAQ +1.23% at 6960, DJI +0.70% at 25239. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.17%, Materials -0.23%, Industrials +1.30%, Cons Discretionary +0.64%, Cons staples +0.61%, Healthcare -0.34%, Financials +0.37%, Tech +1.60%, Telecoms +0.95%, Utilities +0.21%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Earnings before the bell on Monday saw Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Sysco (SYY) beat top and bottom line estimates causing them to surge on the open. Starboard Value made an undisclosed investment in Bristol-Myers (BMY) which caused it to open in the green, whilst Bristol&rsquo;s merger target Celgene (CELG) opened lower over concern of the deal deteriorating; Starboard also made a USD 200mln investment in Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) and appointed two new board members causing the stock to surge. General Electric (GE) opened higher after being awarded a USD 500mln contract modification for turbine engines. Spotify (SPOT) traded in the green on the back of acquiring the podcast studio Gimlet Media. Broker moves saw Intuit (INTU) benefit from an upgrade at Morgan Stanley, Xilinx (XLNX) suffer from a downgrade at Goldman and Yelp (YELP) surging after a Buy initiation at Goldman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 7 TICKS LOWER AT 121-23. </strong>Treasuries started off the week on the back foot amid think trade and ahead of supply this week. The complex ticked temporarily higher after Factory Orders missed expectations. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. In afternoon trade the complex attempted to stir direction but struggled to retain gains and ended the session close to lows of the day. Spreads were close to the unchanged mark, and only slightly steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 3-YEAR TREASURY AUCTION: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction USD 84bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday), and 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday). The Fed will reinvest USD 9.2bln, USD 6.5bln, and USD 4.6bln respectively at the auctions. With no coupons or redemptions, net issuance is also seen at USD 84bln. &ldquo;The January auction started the year on a weaker note,&rdquo; Barclays observes, &ldquo;the bid to cover ratio fell to 2.44x compared to an average of 2.75x in 2018, and furthermore, 3y auctions have tailed an average of 0.3bps each month since July 2018.&rdquo; It also notes that indirect participation slipped at the January auction, falling to 42% from 50% in December. &ldquo;This was largely due to the smaller takedown from foreign investors; notably, direct bidder participation has slowly picked up after falling to a post-crisis low of 3% in November.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, AUD: </strong>More downside and underperformance, as offers ahead of 110.00 in Usd/Jpy were steadily absorbed and technical impulses turned more bullish on the breach of a key Fib level (61.8% at 110.03), leaving option expiries between 110.00-10 in 2 bn exposed. In fact, the headline pair probed a bit beyond these interests at one stage before the NY cut, but not quite high enough the trip stops said to be residing from 110.20-30. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd extended losses towards 0.7210 vs 0.7250+ at best as a retreat in oil prices compounded dire Aussie building approvals data overnight. Next up for the Aud, Tuesday&rsquo;s RBA policy meeting and the tone of latest guidance given no expectations of any change in rates, with one prominent bank looking for a less dovish accompanying statement vs a Brexit-dependent BoE on Thursday and therefore going short of Gbp/Aud &ndash; see our headline feed for more, and Ransquawk&rsquo;s research suite for full previews of the RBA, BoE and other CB gatherings scheduled this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, CAD, NZD, EUR: </strong>All around 0.15-0.3% down vs the Greenback, with Franc inching closer to parity and the Loonie retreating through 1.3100 on the aforementioned pull-back in crude. Even the Kiwi wobbled and slipped a bit further from 0.6900 to circa 0.6875, even though Aud/Nzd is holding below 1.0500.&nbsp; The single currency marginally broke out of its range and to the downside at 1.1420, but only appeared to fill the first layer of bids said to be lurking from 1.1425 to 1.1400 and just through the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Cable topped out again around 1.3100 after a late flurry of buying and another test of the 200 DMA (1.3045) following the latest bad UK PMI miss (construction only just above the 50.0 boom/bust threshold). However, the catalyst or rationale for Sterling&rsquo;s recovery was far from clear or obvious, and may have been more flow related as Eur/Gbp retreated to sub-0.8750 levels from 0.8775 at one stage. NB, an HMRC ruling to wave customs on EU goods at 20 ports in the event of no deal Brexit may have given the Gbp some traction, but the timing did not quite coincide. In later trade, Cable printed fresh session lows at 1.3030 and consolidate just above that level after Tories were said to have had detailed and constructive talks on the Irish backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK: </strong>A bearish start to the week for the Scandi crowns, as the Nok was undermined by the recoil in oil and traded back near 9.7200 vs the Eur, while Eur/Sek rallied just over 10.4300 before fading.</p>\r\n",

Today&rsquo;s movement lacks a specific catalyst though analysts have cited unfavourable prospects for the global economy and insufficient progress in trade talks as two potential factors placing downward pressure on the energy complex.&nbsp; In news flow, Head of Russian Finance Ministry stated that Russian oil production has not peaked yet while Russian oil output dropped by 70k BPD in January to 11.38mln BPD from December; Russian Energy Minister Novak noted that the country is fully complying with the conditions of the OPEC+ deal and is committed to reaching output cut target by May. Elsewhere, Venezuelan exports fell to a ten-month low in January at 1.11mln BPD. Looking ahead, this week&rsquo;s energy inventories see crude building 1.6mln barrels, distillates drawing 1.9mln barrels and gasoline building 1.7mln barrels.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>JPY/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More downside and underperformance, as offers ahead of 110.00 in Usd/Jpy were steadily absorbed and technical impulses turned more bullish on the breach of a key Fib level (61.8% at 110.03), leaving option expiries between 110.00-10 in 2 bn exposed. In fact, the headline pair probed a bit beyond these interests at one stage before the NY cut, but not quite high enough the trip stops said to be residing from 110.20-30. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd extended losses towards 0.7210 vs 0.7250+ at best as a retreat in oil prices compounded dire Aussie building approvals data overnight. Next up for the Aud, Tuesday&rsquo;s RBA policy meeting and the tone of latest guidance given no expectations of any change in rates, with one prominent bank looking for a less dovish accompanying statement vs a Brexit-dependent BoE on Thursday and therefore going short of Gbp/Aud &ndash; see our headline feed for more, and Ransquawk&rsquo;s research suite for full previews of the RBA, BoE and other CB gatherings scheduled this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/NZD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.15-0.3% down vs the Greenback, with Franc inching closer to parity and the Loonie retreating through 1.3100 on the aforementioned pull-back in crude. Even the Kiwi wobbled and slipped a bit further from 0.6900 to circa 0.6875, even though Aud/Nzd is holding below 1.0500.&nbsp; The single currency marginally broke out of its range and to the downside at 1.1420, but only appeared to fill the first layer of bids said to be lurking from 1.1425 to 1.1400 and just through the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable topped out again around 1.3100 after a late flurry of buying and another test of the 200 DMA (1.3045) following the latest bad UK PMI miss (construction only just above the 50.0 boom/bust threshold). However, the catalyst or rationale for Sterling&rsquo;s recovery was far from clear or obvious, and may have been more flow related as Eur/Gbp retreated to sub-0.8750 levels from 0.8775 at one stage. NB, an HMRC ruling to wave customs on EU goods at 20 ports in the event of no deal Brexit may have given the Gbp some traction, but the timing did not quite coincide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bearish start to the week for the Scandi crowns, as the Nok was undermined by the recoil in oil and traded back near 9.7200 vs the Eur, while Eur/Sek rallied just over 10.4300 before fading.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was led higher by energy names and with optimism also seen in the largest weighted financials sector despite the looming Banking Royal Commission final report on the industry which was released after the close and referred 24 misconduct to regulators but did not suggest criminal charges. Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was underpinned by favourable currency moves and a slew of earnings, but with Sony and Honda among the few notable underperformers after Sony reduced its revenue outlook and Honda posted a 34% drop in 9-month net. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) traded indecisive amid the absence of mainland participants all week and early closure in Hong Kong, while Chinese PMI data over the weekend was somewhat inconclusive in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates but Caixin Composite PMI weakened from prior. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower with demand subdued by the gains in riskier assets and as prices tracked the post-NFP declines in T-notes, although losses were contained by the BoJ presence in the market for a respectable JPY 1tln of JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (Jan) 53.6 vs. Exp. 53.3 (Prev. 53.9). (Newswires)<br />Chinese Composite PMI (Jan) 50.9 (Prev. 52.2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRADE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump commented on Saturday that he expects to reach a trade agreement with China soon, while there were also reports that President Trump may meet with Chinese President Xi in Da Nang, Vietnam at the end of February. In related news, China state-owned Cofco Group said it purchased an additional 1mln tons of US soybeans.

(Newswires) Additionally, UK PM May could be planning for a general election in June, according to reports; reports were later downplayed by Boris Johnson. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has invoked the support of Jeremy Corbyn to insist the EU must offer concessions on her Brexit deal, as she states that she will &quot;battle for Britain&quot; when she travels to Brussels to re-open negotiations. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Business Secretary Clark reportedly urged PM May to rule out a no-deal Brexit and told PM May that Nissan&rsquo;s decision to cancel production of a new model in its Sunderland factory was a warning sign of what could occur to the UK car industry in the event of failing to reach an agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alternative Arrangements Working Group consisting of several UK Tory MPs will conduct its first meeting today to discuss alternative arrangements for the backstop, which will be chaired by Brexit Secretary Barclay. (BBC/FT) However, The Times reported that the Conservative Party&rsquo;s fragile Brexit truce was close to collapse yesterday after hardline Brexiteers ruled out two of May&rsquo;s proposals for solving the Irish backstop issue (unilateral withdrawal clause or end date) and insist that they want the backstop scrapped entirely. (Times) Other reports suggested that the truce is fracturing amid fears by Eurosceptics that May will sell them short.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lacklustre start of the week for European equities as the region failed to sustain the momentum seen in Asia. Major indices drifted lower from the open (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.4%) but remain mixed. The energy sector is the marked outperformer amid the price action in the complex in which Brent hovered around USD 63/bbl. In terms of laggards, material names are subdued following weak performances in some base metals during Asia-Pac trade. On the tech front, Japanese-listed Panasonic became the latest company to issue a profit warning, following on from NDIVIA, Apple and Samsung, also citing a slowdown in China, however European tech names largely shrugged this off. The sector is kept afloat by DAX-listed Wirecard (+13.5%) after shares rebounded with a vengeance after an internal investigation into alleged criminal misconduct showed no conclusive findings. Elsewhere, UK-listed gambling names kicked off the week at the top of the Stoxx 600 following a number of positive broker moves at Jefferies, albeit William Hill (+0.4%) and Paddy Power Betfair (+0.4%) have since trimmed gains. Finally, SMI&rsquo;s Julius Baer (-4.6%) rests at the foot of the Swiss index amid disappointing earnings wherein its CEO highlighted that a cost-to-income ratio of 68% is unlikely this year. Looking ahead State-side, notable earnings include Alphabet (market cap of USD 780bln) reporting after US hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - A relatively quiet start to the week, with trade in Asia dampened to an extent by China&rsquo;s Lunar New Year holidays, but the Dollar continues on a firmer footing in wake of last Friday&rsquo;s bumper US payroll number that was only partially nullified by less frothy earnings, a rise in the jobless rate and a downgrade to the previous month&rsquo;s NFP tally. The index is holding towards the upper end of a tight 95.771-571 range, but further off its pre-data low and key chart support ahead of 95.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD - The major laggards, partly due to the aforementioned general Greenback bid, but the former also underperforming as the Nikkei climbed and some stops were triggered at 109.85. However, option related offers appear to have capped the headline pair around 109.90 vs 109.45 at the low, with 2 bn expiries running off between 110.00-10, while techs will also be aware that a 61.8% Fib sits just above the big figure at 110.03. Meanwhile, the Aud has retreated further from recent circa 0.7295 peaks following another sharp decline in Aussie building approvals overnight, and is currently nearer the base of 0.7255-25 parameters. Note, expiry interest may also keep Aud/Usd depressed given 1.6 bn at 0.7240-50 for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP - The next weakest G10 links, as the Franc edges down through 0.9950 support and probes below 0.9970, while the Pound is still suffering from Brexit fatigue and uncertainty in the main. Cable is hovering a few pips off the 200 DMA (1.3045) vs 1.3095 at best, with additional pressure coming via another sizeable UK PMI miss, as construction tumbled to 50.6 from 52.8 and vs an expected 52.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/EUR - All narrowly mixed vs the Buck, as the Loonie consolidates gains beyond 1.3100 and the 200 DMA amidst another upturn in crude prices, while the Kiwi gleans support from favourable cross-flows vs the Aud (sub-1.0500) to keep tabs, or within sight of 0.6900. Elsewhere, the single currency is restrained between 1.1435-65 and 2 bn option expiries at 1.1450-65 on the topside vs buying interest from 1.1425 to 1.1400 and just under.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have bounced further from early Liffe lows to trade 9 ticks over last Friday&rsquo;s close at 123.42 vs 27 ticks under at one stage, and the recovery has been aided by the much weaker than forecast UK construction PMI. Bunds have also regrouped, but not quite to the same degree despite suspected dip buying around the 165.30 Eurex intraday base that coincides with chart support down to 165.28. The 10 year German debt future remains just a few ticks shy of parity, and perhaps undermined by the relatively impressive BTP resurgence from 127.31 (-78 ticks) to around 128.00 again and not far from 128.29 highs, which also appears partly technical as a 127.35 mid-January low was tested and breached, but not convincingly. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are still mildly softer and the curve fractionally steeper ahead of a fairly busy agenda including housing data, NY ISM, factory orders and durable goods revisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil complex remains on an upwards trajectory after consolidating during Asia-Pac hours. WTI (+0.1%) and Brent (+0.5%) are choppy and off highs as the former still resides above USD 55/bbl while the latter hovers around USD 63/bbl. Recent gains are attributed to a number of factors leading to a tighter market. As output curbs come into effect, OPEC&rsquo;s oil supply fell by the most in two years in January; according to a Reuters&rsquo; survey. Meanwhile, Russia&rsquo;s production fell from a record 11.45mln BPD in December to 11.38mln BPD in January, around 35k BPD from October 2018 (the baselines for the global oil accord), albeit, Moscow missed the output cut target last month according to Energy Ministry data. Furthermore, adverse weather in Libya resulted in crude and condensate exports declining to a six-month low with the country&rsquo;s largest oil field still halted. Prices are also underpinned as US sanctions on Venezuela sharply limits oil transactions between the OPEC member and other countries, but to a lesser extent compared to the Iranian sanctions last year; according to experts citing US Treasury data. Furthermore, oil exports from the country fell to a ten-month low with exports to US and China both declining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals are relatively mixed with spot gold (-0.5%) unwinding some risk premium as risk aversion wanes following Friday&rsquo;s above-forecast US jobs report and optimistic China-US trade developments. Meanwhile copper was lacklustre as the red metal&rsquo;s largest buyer is away on a week-long holiday. On the flip side, iron ore prices surged as demand concerns continue to weigh on the base metal amid the collapse of Vale&rsquo;s dam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Head of Russian Finance Ministry said that Russian oil production has not peaked yet. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuelan oil exports fell to a ten-month low in Jan at 1.11mln BPD (-11% M/M, -16% Y/Y); according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Exports to US: -16% M/M , -12% Y/Y to 355k BPD</li>\r\n  <li>Exports to China: -6.1% M/M to 248k BPD</li>\r\n  <li>Exports to India: +3.3% M/M to 303.2k BPD<br />&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Bunds have also regrouped, but not quite to the same degree despite suspected dip buying around the 165.30 Eurex intraday base that coincides with chart support down to 165.28. The 10 year German debt future remains just a few ticks shy of parity, and perhaps undermined by the relatively impressive BTP resurgence from 127.31 (-78 ticks) to 128.00+ again and not far from 128.29 highs, which also appears partly technical as a 127.35 mid-January low was tested and breached, but not convincingly. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are still mildly softer and the curve fractionally steeper ahead of a fairly busy agenda including housing data, NY ISM, factory orders and durable goods revisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil complex remains on an upwards trajectory after consolidating during Asia-Pac hours. WTI (+0.6%) and Brent (+1.0%) reclaimed USD 55/bbl and USD 63/bbl to the upside, with gains attributed to a number of factors leading to a tighter market. As output curbs come into effect, OPEC&rsquo;s oil supply fell by the most in two years in January; according to a Reuters&rsquo; survey. Meanwhile, Russia&rsquo;s production fell from a record 11.45mln BPD in December to 11.38mln BPD in January, around 35k BPD from October 2018 (the baselines for the global oil accord), albeit, Moscow missed the output cut target last month according to Energy Ministry data. Furthermore, adverse weather in Libya resulted in crude and condensate exports declining to a six-month low with the country&rsquo;s largest oil field still halted. Prices are also underpinned as US sanctions on Venezuela sharply limits oil transactions between the OPEC member and other countries, but to a lesser extent compared to the Iranian sanctions last year; according to experts citing US Treasury data. Furthermore, oil exports from the country fell to a ten-month low with exports to US and China both declining. Finally, State-side, Friday saw the release of the Baker Hughes rig count wherein US oil drillers cut active rigs to an eight-month low with 1055 oil and gas rigs in operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals are relatively mixed with spot gold (-0.5%) unwinding some risk premium as risk aversion wanes following Friday&rsquo;s above-forecast US jobs report and optimistic China-US trade developments. Meanwhile copper was lacklustre as the red metal&rsquo;s largest buyer is away on a week-long holiday. On the flip side, iron ore prices surged as demand concerns continue to weigh on the base metal amid the collapse of Vale&rsquo;s dam.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, the Aud has retreated further from recent circa 0.7295 peaks following another sharp decline in Aussie building approvals overnight, and is currently nearer the base of 0.7255-25 parameters.

(Newswires)<br />Australian Building Approvals (Dec) Y/Y -22.5% vs. Exp. -10.9% (Prev. -32.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were uneventful overnight in which WTI drifted sideways but near the highs during last Friday&rsquo;s US session where prices got a boost from trade hopes, strong NFP numbers and reports of the sharpest drop in OPEC output in 2 years. Elsewhere, gold pries were slightly lower as the greenback eked mild gains overnight, while copper was lacklustre amid similar price action across the complex and amid the absence of its largest buyer China.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (1/Feb) showed Total rigs -14 at 1055; oil rigs -15 at 847; gas rigs +1 at 198. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he wants a new nuclear treaty with Russia. In related news, Russian President Putin said the US breached the INF arms treaty and that Russian will also suspend the treaty, while he is said to agree with Defense Ministry proposal to begin development of a mid-range supersonic missile. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey President Erdogan said Turkey and Syria have begun low level discussions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended Friday&rsquo;s session in negative territory -supported by a strong US labour market report which added 304k jobs to in January. Optimism continued also on the trade front fuelled by hopes that a deal will be put on paper by March 1st. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.7bps at settlement. Light profit taking emerged into the European session close but the complex extended weakness into the US afternoon trade. The curve was mixed; steeper at the front end and flatter at the long end. US T-note futures (H9) settled ticks -17 at 121-30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he will be looking at declaring a national emergency over the wall and that an emergency would have a strong legal standing while may discuss a national emergency and wall on February 5th. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excerpt released by the White House shows US President Trump is to tell congress at State of the Union Address about progress on China trade talks and is to communicate that Republicans and Democrats can break decades of political stalemate, while President Trump will also ask congress to pass his NAFTA replacement and to give him an infrastructure bill. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said Chairman Powell is coming around the view that more rate hikes are not needed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said he is not saying they are never going to raise rates again, while he added that that he has not changed his own view since December and that he believes Fed should keep rates on hold for months not weeks. Kaplan also commented that inflation pressures are very likely to be muted and the Fed has the luxury of patience over rates. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) is led higher by energy names and with optimism also seen in the largest weighted financials sector despite the looming Banking Royal Commission final report on the industry, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) is underpinned by recent favourable currency moves and a slew of earnings but with Sony as one of the few notable laggards after it reduced its revenue outlook. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) trades indecisive amid the absence of mainland participants all week and ahead of the early closure in Hong Kong, while Chinese PMI data over the weekend was somewhat inconclusive in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates but Caixin Composite PMI weakened from the prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets lack firm direction overnight with the DXY flat after last week&rsquo;s mixed jobs data from US where Non-Farm Payrolls topped expectations but coincided with a surprise increase in the Unemployment Rate, while most major pairs are in consolidation alongside this week&rsquo;s deluge of market closures with EUR/USD and GBP/USD unchanged at the 1.14 and 1.30 handles respectively. Elsewhere, antipodeans are mixed with AUD/USD pressured after Building Approvals showed the largest contraction in more than 5 years and with NZD/USD nursing recent losses to just about reclaim the 0.6900 level, while USD/JPY is relatively quiet but has marginally extended on Friday&rsquo;s best levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with demand subdued by the gains in riskier assets and as prices track the post-NFP declines in T-notes, although losses are contained by the BoJ presence in the market for a respectable JPY 1tln of JGBs.</p>\r\n",
