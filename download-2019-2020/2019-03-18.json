White House Economic Adviser Hassett said the US is still working hard on reaching a deal with China but differences remain. US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said talks remain dynamic, and that China has made very attractive offers for agricultural purchases. Away from the US, a draft statement for the EU &amp; China April summit revealed the two powers are to agree to conclude a bilateral investment pact in 2020, they will list the main barriers to trade by this summer, and to set removal deadlines by 2020; the summit will also see them commit to begin negotiations on industrial subsidies, and a new set of guidelines for government-supported export credits.</p><p><strong>* ANALYSIS: </strong>The market has calmly digested reports that a Trump/Xi meeting to wrap up a trade deal may be pushed back to June (meeting was originally expected end-March, and just last week, we were guided towards a delayed April meeting). We have come to expect that any pushing back of the trade timetable was negative for risk assets, but we haven’t seen any of that on Monday, where risk assets mostly saw upside. Perhaps the measured response is a result of the dovish central bank expectations for this week (ex the Norges Bank, which is expected to lift rates by 25bps), with the Fed expected to dial-down its growth forecasts, end its balance sheet run off, while remaining data dependent; BOE seen standing pat, SNB will probably mirror the ECB’s recent dovishness. This would follow a softening in the tone of growth forecasts from major central banks and institutions, which analysts are minded to believe will continue to support risk. Barclays’ analysts still warn, however, that if recent experience is a guide, support from dovish central banks has done little to offset the drag from weaker growth. Accordingly, it is worth noting the tone of flash PMI data, on the slate for the latter part of the week. A decent set of data, may once again start leading some to question the dovish prices, given the recent stabilisation in Chinese and European data, as well as the data surprise indices which have once again been ticking up in March.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The week began with the likelihood of a third meaningful vote on UK PM May’s Brexit deal being majorly diminished, where HoC speaker John Bercow said he would not allow the vote to go in for a third round unless there were changes made to the deal, effectively ruling out the government’s ability to play politics in order to muster together additional votes for May’s deal. Consequentially, an EU official has said an extension is now more likely, with the focus now on the political declaration. Analysts suggest Bercow’s ruling will have helped May by giving her the time needed to make changes to her meaningful vote and to gain the needed supporters.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (J9) SETTLE $0.57 HIGHER AT $59.09; BRENT (K9) SETTLE $0.38 HIGHER AT $67.54. </strong>Crude edged higher on Monday in the midst of OPEC+ deciding to hold back their April meeting and bullish supply cut news on the back of the OPEC JMMC meeting held over the weekend. The oil cartel has postponed its previously suggested April meeting till June 25th-26th before it makes any adjustments to output targets, Saudi’s Energy Minister Al-Falih confirmed; “the decision to wait for more data makes sense in our view, particularly since Russian production isn’t expected to decline to its 2019 limit until April,” analysts at Citigroup commented on the decision. “Gasoline futures continue to lead the wider petroleum complex higher”, the bank said, “supported by an assortment of refinery outages, including the 130,500 bpd fluid catalytic cracker at the Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, a key source of supply to the New York Harbor delivery point for RBOB futures… bullish for the gasoline market and also supportive for the market overall.” Elsewhere, all countries at the OPEC JMMC meeting said they will exceed their voluntary output adjustments in the coming months, seeing overall output cut conformity in February at 90%; Al-Falih added that he expects OPEC+ to reach full compliance within weeks and sees an extension of the supply cut agreement through 2019. The prodigal Libya NOC said output has risen to 1.2mln BPD, with the El Sharara oilfield (capacity 300K BPD) currently pumping 260K BPD.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.37% at 2833, NDX +0.26% at 7326, DJI +0.25% at 25914. SECTORS: Energy +1.40%, Materials +0.16%, Industrials +0.87%, Cons Discretionary +1.05%, Cons Staples +0.28%, Healthcare -0.15%, Financials +1.04%, Tech +0.41%, Telecoms -0.80%, Utilities -0.40%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) begun the week again on a downbeat, as US federal authorities have begun probing its manufacturing process for 737 MAX jets. Facebook (FB) was a weight on the tech sector after having a price target slash at BAML and a downgrade at Needham. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) surged on promising results from one of its aortic devices, however, competitors Medtronic (MDT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Becton Dickinson (BDX) all traded lower after the FDA posted a letter expressing concern on the use of paclitaxel-coated products. Disney (DIS) and Fox (FOXA) traded lower following Fox’s shareholders vote on the consideration they would prefer for its acquisition. Marriott (MAR) opened higher after providing guidance as part of its three-year plan. Worldpay (WP) rallied on the announcement Fidelity (FIS) would be acquiring it in a cash and stock deal.

Oilfield services stocks such as Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) were outperformers. Kraft Heinz (KHC) underperformed after receiving a Nasdaq notice for a delayed 10-K filing.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 4 TICKS LOWER AT 122-27.</strong> Yields were little changed on Monday, ahead of the FOMC on Wednesday, which is expected to be a dovish update, where forecasts are cut, the central bank announces the end of QT, while reiterating data-dependence and patience. The curve was biased towards small flattening, at settlement, having traded a lot of the early part of the session slightly steeper. There was little on the data docket or speakers, with the focus on flows; some had suggested that CTAs sold the uptick, though the move lower couldn’t gain traction after real money buyers came in on at the long-end. Strengthening equities tried to influence the action, though volumes were low, and even equities themselves were subject to choppy trading at times.</p><p><strong>* USD, EMFX:</strong> The buck pared back losses incurred through Asia- and early European trade, and we are more or less flat entering APAC trade. Clearly the major catalyst this week is the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, where the central bank is expected to cut growth and inflation forecasts, lower the 'dots' and reiterate commitment to a data-dependent policy approach in the framework of patience; it is also expected to confirm the end of QT this year. This should generally be a favourable backdrop for risk assets, analysts have said, particularly, the EMFX complex. BlackRock's strategists note that EM markets could end up recouping the losses incurred last year: \"All the key challenges emerging markets had last year have been surmounted and the global liquidity has returned to emerging markets’ favor,\" BlackRock's EM strategist said (rate differentials vs US, dovish central bank policy, China liquidity injections, etc). BlackRock notes that EM equities are correlated to the weaker buck, and the strategist recommended Mexican, Argentine and Indonesian stocks. \"When a currency weakens or bond yields increase, typically equities go down, so if we've become positive on a currency, firstly a perfect way to express it is through an equity. The key things riding the dollar last year are now out.” That being said, not all EMFX is equal, clearly. On Monday, the ZAR and TRY - typically two that rally amid global risk-on - were lower, largely on domestic factors (Eskom announcing an intensification of load shedding in ZAR, and Turkey entering technical recession last week for the TRY). In Brazil, however, the BRL rallied on Monday, despite its Vice President expressing his hope that lawmakers would approve pension reform by June, or early Q3 - markets have wanted to see this particular segment of reform out of the way by the Parliamentary recess in July, in order for the new government to show its pro-business credentials.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Trades negative against the Buck, after more uncertainty was injected into the Brexit process via the Speaker of the House, who said PM May's MV3 cannot be voted on in its current form, and would need to be materially different from the two previous versions. The news appears negative, however, some commentators have noted that this helps May's position, in the sense that it allows more time to rally support. There is some A list data on the slate for later in the week, as well as a BOE meeting. However, don't expect GBP to be a function of fundamental news ahead of the EU summit next week (and until A50 is extended). Some have noted that UK surprise indices have risen to almost 5-year highs (according to Citi's model), but that has not been driving sterling.</p><p><strong>* COMMODITY FX:</strong> Ahead of the RBA's meeting minutes, the AUD traded firmer, largely influenced by the constructive risk backdrop. Additionally, some analysts suggest the Aussie is seeing upside based on a continued short-squeeze, which was enough to take AUDUSD back to the 0.71 area. Firmer commodity prices also helped. However, firmer oil prices were not benefiting the NOK, which traded lower against both the USD and the EUR, despite the Norges Bank widely seen lifting rates on Thursday. The CAD also struggled to benefit.</p><p><strong>* HAVENS: </strong>The Franc briefly breached parity in the run up to the SNB and FOMC, but is still holding steady vs the Eur on the 1.1350 pivot, while the JPY straddles 111.50 in wake of mixed Japanese trade figures and reports suggesting that some BOJ members are not even sure if the 2% inflation target is attainable by 2021, while exports data overnight was also soft. Note also, decent option expiry interest may have hampered trade into the NY cut as 1.1 bn rolled off from 111.55-60 today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The market has calmly digested reports that a Trump/Xi meeting to wrap up a trade deal may be pushed back to June (meeting was originally expected end-March, and just last week, we were guided towards a delayed April meeting). We have come to expect that any pushing back of the trade timetable was negative for risk assets, but we haven’t seen any of that on Monday, where risk assets mostly saw upside. Perhaps the measured response is a result of the dovish central bank expectations for this week (ex the Norges Bank, which is expected to lift rates by 25bps), with the Fed expected to dial-down its growth forecasts, end its balance sheet run off, while remaining data dependent; BOE seen standing pat, SNB will probably mirror the ECB’s recent dovishness. This would follow a softening in the tone of growth forecasts from major central banks and institutions, which analysts are minded to believe will continue to support risk. Barclays’ analysts still warn, however, that if recent experience is a guide, support from dovish central banks has done little to offset the drag from weaker growth. Accordingly, it is worth noting the tone of flash PMI data, on the slate for the latter part of the week. A decent set of data, may once again start leading some to question the dovish pricing, some have suggested, given the recent stabilisation in Chinese and European data, as well as the data surprise indices which have once again been ticking up in March.</p>",

        "subject": "FX ANALYSIS: USD in focus ahead of Fed (USD, EMFX, GBP, JPY, CHF, AUD, CAD)",
        "content": "<p><strong>* USD, EMFX:</strong> The buck pared back losses incurred through Asia- and early European trade, and we are more or less flat entering APAC trade. Clearly the major catalyst this week is the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, where the central bank is expected to cut growth and inflation forecasts, lower the 'dots' and reiterate commitment to a data-dependent policy approach in the framework of patience; it is also expected to confirm the end of QT this year. This should generally be favourable backdrop for risk assets, analysts have said, particularly, the EMFX complex. BlackRock's strategists note that EM markets could end up recouping the losses incurred last year: \"All the key challenges emerging markets had last year have been surmounted and the global liquidity has returned to emerging markets’ favor,\" BlackRock's EM strategist said (rate differentials vs US, dovish central bank policy, China liquidity injections, etc). BlackRock notes that EM equities are correlated to the weaker buck, and the strategist recommended Mexican, Argentine and Indonesian stocks. \"When a currency weakens or bond yields increase, typically equities go down,so if we've become positive on a currency, firstly a perfect way to express it is through an equity. The key things riding the dollar last year are now out.” That being said, not all EMFX is equal, clearly. On Monday, the ZAR and TRY - typically two that rally amid global risk-on - were lower, largely on domestic factors (Eskom announcing an intensification of load shedding in ZAR, and Turkey entering technical recession last week for the TRY). In Brazil, however, the BRL rallied on Monday, despite its Vice President expressing his hope that lawmakers would approve pension reform by June, or early Q3 - markets have wanted to see this particular segment of reform out of the way by the Parliamentary recess in July, in order for hte new government to show its pro-business credentials.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Trades negative against the Buck, after more uncertainty was injected into the Brexit process via the Speaker of the House, who said PM May's MV3 cannot be voted on in its current form, and would need to be materially different from the two previous versions. The news appears negative, however, some commentators have noted that this helps May's position, in the sense that it allows more time to rally support. There is some A list data on the slate for later in the week, as well as a BOE meeting. However, don't expect GBP to be a function of fundamental news ahead of the EU summit next week (and until A50 is extended). Some have noted that UK surprise indices have risen to almost 5-year highs (according to Citi's model), but that has not been driving sterling.</p><p><strong>* COMMODITY FX:</strong> Ahead of the RBA's meeting minutes, the AUD traded firmer, largely influenced by the constructive risk backdrop. Additionally, some analysts suggest the Aussie is seeing upside based on a continued short-squeeze, which was enough to take AUDUSD back to the 0.71 area. Firmer commodity prices also helped. However, firmer oil prices were not benefiting the NOK, which traded lower against both the USD and the EUR, despite the Norges Bank widely seen lifting rates on Thursday. The CAD also struggled to benefit.</p><p><strong>* HAVENS: </strong>The Franc briefly breached parity in the run up to the SNB and FOMC, but is still holding steady vs the Eur on the 1.1350 pivot, while the JPY straddles 111.50 in wake of mixed Japanese trade figures and reports suggesting that some BOJ members are not even sure if the 2% inflation target is attainable by 2021, while exports data overnight was also soft. Note also, decent option expiry interest may have hampered trade into the NY cut as 1.1 bn rolled off from 111.55-60 today.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is holding up relatively well in the run up to the Fed on Wednesday amidst dovish expectations, centring on lower 2019 dot plots or even none at all, and an early end to the balance sheet run-off. The DXY has also drawn some encouragement from a technical standpoint as the recent low and a chart support level held in again just under 96.400. The index is currently around 96.500 again within a 96.596-376 range.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Dollar’s resilience, Sterling seems unable to shrug off the ongoing Brexit impasse as UK PM May struggles to garner enough support for the WA to hold a 3rd MV before this week’s EU Summit and avoid asking for more than a short technical extension to Article 50. Indeed, as the clock ticks down to March 29 there has even been talk about an emergency or crisis Summit just a day before, as talks go on here between the Government and DUP, whose backing is seen pivotal to whether the ERG buys into the deal, even though a hard core of the latter are said to be against it no matter what. Cable is just off a marginal new session low circa 1.3213 and Eur/Gbp tested 0.8580+ before topping out. Back to Brexit, the HoC Speaker will make a statement at 15.30GMT, confirming earlier media reports, and possibly about the legal process surrounding multiple votes on the same amendment. Meanwhile, another political commentator suggests a deal with the DUP is almost guaranteed not to be struck this week, and MV3 could now take place next week.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodeans remain in pole position, but have pared more gains vs their US counterpart due to the aforementioned Usd recovery, with the Aud only just clinging to 0.7100 and Nzd easing back towards 0.6860 as the Aussie/Kiwi cross holds just under 1.0350. Ahead, Westpac’s consumer survey for Q1 comes just 2 days before NZ Q4 GDP data, while RBA’s Kent may provide some independent fodder and direction for the Aud.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Still consolidating on the 1.1300 handle, but unable to test resistance above 1.1350 as the Buck bounced and the headline pair remained in a 1.1320-60 range. No real response to Eurozone trade data of the Buba monthly report that noted downside pressures impacting the German economy.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Franc briefly breached parity in the run up to the SNB and FOMC, but is still holding steady vs the Eur on the 1.1350 pivot, while the Loonie has slipped towards the bottom of a 1.3300-50 band and the Jpy straddles 111.50 in wake of mixed Japanese trade figures and reports suggesting that some BoJ members are not even sure if the 2% inflation target is attainable by 2021. Note also, decent option expiry interest may have hampered trade&nbsp; into the NY cut as 1.1 bn rolled off from 111.55-60 today.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rub has been a marked regional outperformer on the back of a rebound in Brent prices and bullish Rouble chart signals vs the Usd as it climbed through 64.5000 and tested 6.1500+ levels at one stage.</p>",

UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.6%) is the marked outperformer and major beneficiary from the surge in base metal prices with heavyweight miners all sitting comfortably at the top of the index (Rio Tinto +2.5%, Anglo American +2.3%, Antofagasta +2.1%, Glencore +1.8%). Sector-wise, material names initially outperformed (for the aforementioned reason) but was later overtaken by financial names ahead of a plethora of central bank rate decision including FOMC and BOE. Financial names may also feel support from the Deutschebank (+3.1%)/Commerzbank (+5.8%) saga, with the latest reports confirming merger talks between the two banks after the German government approved the tie-up, although, German union Verdi warned that merger could put up to 30k jobs at risk, to which the government replied that jobs at stake are being examined. On a broader front for European banks, GS notes that the sector has been amongst the weakest performers in the Stoxx 600 YTD as the banks continue to battle with concerns over long term growth. In terms of strategy, GS noted that Japanese banks trades at an even lower multiple than the European, but the latest TLTRO move (although positive for sector liquidity) “further erodes the competitive advantage of European banks”. GS is taking a neutral stance on the European equity market over the next three months.</p><p>Boeing (BA) - the US Transportation Department are reportedly probing FAA approval of the 737 Max, according to WSJ citing sources (WSJ)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD – Off overnight highs, but the Aussie and Kiwi remain elevated and ahead of their G10 counterparts on a combination of renewed risk appetite, short covering and for the former also a supply-related rise in iron ore prices following further production problems for Brazil’s Vale. Aud/Usd has extended its rebound to 0.7100+ and Nzd/Usd to around 0.6875 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0350 ahead of Westpac’s NZ Q1 consumer survey later today and Q4 GDP on Wednesday. In terms of options, large expiries in Nzd/Usd run off later, including 1 bn at 0.6825 and 1.5 bn at 0.6925.</p><p>GBP – In contrast to the outperformance down under noted above, the Pound has handed back gains vs a generally soft Dollar and weakened relative to the Euro amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty after last week’s string of UK Parliamentary votes, as PM May strives to drum up DUP support for the current Withdrawal Agreement in the hope that this may entice enough of the ERG to back the deal in time for a pre-EU Summit 3rd MV. Cable has backed off from another 1.3300 venture to sub-1.3250 and Eur/Gbp has bounced to around 0.8570 vs circa 0.8510 at one stage, with a hefty 1.7 bn option expiry at the 0.8500 strike now looking pretty safe.</p><p>EUR – Aside from benefiting from Sterling’s Brexit angst, the single currency has taken advantage of the aforementioned Greenback weakness post-recent soft if not quite downbeat US data and pre-FOMC. Indeed, the headline pair has rebounded further from early March lows (in wake of the dovish ECB) to establish a firmer footing above 1.1300 and briefly touched 1.1350, with the next bullish targets at 1.1367 and 1.1373 (100 DMA and 50% Fib of the 1.1570-1.1177 move respectively).</p><p>CHF/CAD/JPY – All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Franc attempts to break resistance at the psychological parity level in the run up to the SNB and FOMC, but holds steady vs the Eur on the 1.1350 pivot, while the Loonie sits midway between 1.3300-50 ahead of Canadian securities data for January and the Jpy straddles 111.50 in wake of mixed Japanese trade figures and reports suggesting that some BoJ members are not even sure if the 2% inflation target is attainable by 2021. Note also, decent option expiry interest could be influential given 1.1 bn rolling off from 111.55-60 today.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It was relatively abrupt and did roughly coincide with a downturn in EU equities, but not really enough to suggest asset-reallocation, so it looks like the recovery in Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries from earlier session lows was prompted by something else or a mixture of factors. Given the UK benchmark’s outperformance and especially strong bounce from worst levels to trade 30 ticks above the previous 126.90 close, Brexit seems a valid supportive impulse as the clock ticks down to either another MV or returning to Brussels to request an A 50 extension, or more likely both. Meanwhile, its German equivalent has been 22 ticks above par at 164.36 and a bit less hampered by outperformance across the Eurozone periphery after positive ratings reviews for Italy and Portugal in particular, and USTs have nudged fresh, albeit marginal overnight highs awaiting the Fed on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI (-0.4%) and Brent (-0.2%)</strong> futures are marginally lower as participants digest the latest from the meeting of the OPEC cartel in Baku, although there seems to be some discrepancy as to when the next JMMC meeting will take place. Energy futures saw a marginal leg lower, with WTI losing more ground below its 100 WMA (USD 58.46/bbl) after sources stated that the JMMC panel recommended no meeting in April, but the Kazakh Energy Minister said nothing was set in stone. Furthermore, the Iraqi Energy Minister reportedly confirmed that the next JMMC meeting will take place in June, however sources later came out with a May meeting in Riyadh. Prices were little affected by developments over the weekend wherein the Saudi Energy Minister stated that the Kingdom’s March and April output is to drop to around 9.8mln BPD vs. February level of 10.09mln BPD (January 10.24mln BPD). Recalling some comments from last week, a Saudi official stated that March an April output is to be “well below” 10mln BPD. Saudi did however mention that OPEC’s job from rebalancing is far from over whilst signalling that output curbs need to be extended to H2 2019.</p><p>Elsewhere, the metals complex is bolstered by a pullback in the Greenback with <strong>gold </strong>reclaiming the USD 1300/oz level and breaching its 50 DMA to the upside at 1304.10 whilst copper prices benefit from the overall risk appetite. Finally, <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> futures surged over 3% on supply concerns after a Brazilian court ordered Vale halts operations at another mine and as the miner suggested a 12mln ton decline in annual output due to dam suspensions.</p><p><strong>Saudi’s February production stood at 10.09mln BPD vs. 10.24mln BPD in January, according to sources</strong>.

UK’s <strong>FTSE 100 (+0.7%)</strong> is the marked outperformer and major beneficiary from the surge in base metal prices with heavyweight miners all sitting comfortably at the top of the <strong>index (Rio Tinto +2.2%, Anglo American +2.1%, Antofagasta +1.8%, Glencore +1.7%).</strong> Sector-wise, material names initially outperformed (for the aforementioned reason) but was later overtaken by financial names ahead of a plethora of central bank rate decision including FOMC and BOE. Financial names may also feel support from the <strong>Deutschebank (+3.9%)/Commerzbank (+6.6%)</strong> saga, with the latest reports confirming merger talks between the two banks after the German government approved the tie-up, although, German union Verdi warned that merger could put up to 30k jobs at risk, to which the government replied that jobs at stake are being examined. On a broader front for European banks, GS notes that the sector has been amongst the weakest performers in the Stoxx 600 YTD as the banks continue to battle with concerns over long term growth. In terms of strategy, GS noted that Japanese banks trades at an even lower multiple than the European, but the latest TLTRO move (although positive for sector liquidity) “further erodes the competitive advantage of European banks”. GS is taking a neutral stance on the European equity market over the next three months.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - Off overnight highs, but the Aussie and Kiwi remain elevated and ahead of their G10 counterparts on a combination of renewed risk appetite, short covering and for the former also a supply-related rise in iron ore prices following further production problems for Brazil’s Vale. Aud/Usd has extended its rebound to 0.7100+ and Nzd/Usd to around 0.6875 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0350 ahead of Westpac’s NZ Q1 consumer survey later today and Q4 GDP on Wednesday. In terms of options, large expiries in Nzd/Usd run off later, including 1 bn at 0.6825 and 1.5 bn at 0.6925.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - In contrast to the outperformance down under noted above, the Pound has handed back gains vs a generally soft Dollar and weakened relative to the Euro amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty after last week’s string of UK Parliamentary votes, as PM May strives to drum up DUP support for the current Withdrawal Agreement in the hope that this may entice enough of the ERG to back the deal in time for a pre-EU Summit 3rd MV. Cable has backed off from another 1.3300 venture to sub-1.3250 and Eur/Gbp has bounced to around 0.8570 vs circa 0.8510 at one stage, with a hefty 1.7 bn option expiry at the 0.8500 strike now looking pretty safe.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong> - Aside from benefiting from Sterling’s Brexit angst, the single currency has taken advantage of the aforementioned Greenback weakness post-recent soft if not quite downbeat US data and pre-FOMC. Indeed, the headline pair has rebounded further from early March lows (in wake of the dovish ECB) to establish a firmer footing above 1.1300 and briefly touched 1.1350, with the next bullish targets at 1.1367 and 1.1373 (100 DMA and 50% Fib of the 1.1570-1.1177 move respectively).</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY</strong> - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Franc attempts to break resistance at the psychological parity level in the run up to the SNB and FOMC, but holds steady vs the Eur on the 1.1350 pivot, while the Loonie sits midway between 1.3300-50 ahead of Canadian securities data for January and the Jpy straddles 111.50 in wake of mixed Japanese trade figures and reports suggesting that some BoJ members are not even sure if the 2% inflation target is attainable by 2021. Note also, decent option expiry interest could be influential given 1.1 bn rolling off from 111.55-60 today.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It was relatively abrupt and did roughly coincide with a downturn in EU equities, but not really enough to suggest asset-reallocation, so it looks like the recovery in <strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> from earlier session lows was prompted by something else or a mixture of factors. Given the UK benchmark’s outperformance and especially strong bounce from worst levels to trade 30 ticks above the previous 126.90 close, Brexit seems a valid supportive impulse as the clock ticks down to either another MV or returning to Brussels to request an A 50 extension, or more likely both. Meanwhile, its German equivalent has been 22 ticks above par at 164.36 and a bit less hampered by outperformance across the Eurozone periphery after positive ratings reviews for Italy and Portugal in particular, and <strong>USTs</strong> have nudged fresh, albeit marginal overnight highs awaiting the Fed on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI (-0.2%)</strong> and <strong>Brent (+0.1%)</strong> futures are choppy as participants digest the latest from the meeting of the OPEC cartel in Baku, although there seems to be some discrepancy as to when the next JMMC meeting will take place. Energy futures saw a marginal leg lower, with <strong>WTI</strong> losing more ground below its 100 WMA (USD 58.46/bbl) after sources stated that the JMMC panel recommended no meeting in April, but the Kazakh Energy Minister said nothing was set in stone. Furthermore, the Iraqi Energy Minister reportedly confirmed that the next JMMC meeting will take place in June, however sources later came out with a May meeting in Riyadh. Prices were little affected by developments over the weekend wherein the Saudi Energy Minister stated that the Kingdom’s March and April output is to drop to around 9.8mln BPD vs. February level of 10.09mln BPD (January 10.24mln BPD). Recalling some comments from last week, a Saudi official stated that March an April output is to be “well below” 10mln BPD. Saudi did however mention that OPEC’s job from rebalancing is far from over whilst signalling that output curbs need to be extended to H2 2019. The oil market saw a pop higher in recent trade after the OPEC statement noted that all the countries at the JMMC said they will exceed their voluntary output adjustments in the coming months, with February conformity seen at 90%.</p><p>Elsewhere, the metals complex is bolstered by a pullback in the Greenback with <strong>gold</strong> reclaiming the USD 1300/oz level and breaching its 50 DMA to the upside at 1304.10 whilst <strong>copper</strong> prices benefit from the overall risk appetite. Finally, <strong>Dalian iron ore futures</strong> surged over 3% on supply concerns after a Brazilian court ordered Vale halts operations at another mine and as the miner suggested a 12mln ton decline in annual output due to dam suspensions.</p>",

Aud/Usd has extended its rebound to 0.7100+ and Nzd/Usd to around 0.6875 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0350 ahead of Westpac’s NZ Q1 consumer survey later today and Q4 GDP on Wednesday. In terms of options, large expiries in Nzd/Usd run off later, including 1 bn at 0.6825 and 1.5 bn at 0.6925.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>In contrast to the outperformance down under noted above, the Pound has handed back gains vs a generally soft Dollar and weakened relative to the Euro amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty after last week’s string of UK Parliamentary votes, as PM May strives to drum up DUP support for the current Withdrawal Agreement in the hope that this may entice enough of the ERG to back the deal in time for a pre-EU Summit 3rd MV. Cable has backed off from another 1.3300 venture to sub-1.3250 and Eur/Gbp has bounced to around 0.8570 vs circa 0.8510 at one stage, with a hefty 1.7 bn option expiry at the 0.8500 strike now looking pretty safe.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Aside from benefiting from Sterling’s Brexit angst, the single currency has taken advantage of the aforementioned Greenback weakness post-recent soft if not quite downbeat US data and pre-FOMC. Indeed, the headline pair has rebounded further from early March lows (in wake of the dovish ECB) to establish a firmer footing above 1.1300 and briefly touched 1.1350, with the next bullish targets at 1.1367 and 1.1373 (100 DMA and 50% Fib of the 1.1570-1.1177 move respectively).</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Franc attempts to break resistance at the psychological parity level in the run up to the SNB and FOMC, but holds steady vs the Eur on the 1.1350 pivot, while the Loonie sits midway between 1.3300-50 ahead of Canadian securities data for January and the Jpy straddles 111.50 in wake of mixed Japanese trade figures and reports suggesting that some BoJ members are not even sure if the 2% inflation target is attainable by 2021. Note also, decent option expiry interest could be influential given 1.1 bn rolling off from 111.55-60 today.</p>",

Although, Farage and other Eurosceptic's vowed to lobby member states hoping that one will veto an extension.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*SEB'S VIEW</strong></p><p>SEB’s view is that all decisions made by the EU must take into account the fact the member countries wish for the UK to remain in the EU or at least for cooperation to be as close as possible. Therefore, the EU would have no major objections to an extension; as the possibility remains for the UK to entirely reassess its position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*KEY DATES</strong></p><p>March 18th - MPs to discuss Meaning Vote 3</p><p>March 19th/20th – Parliamentary vote on Withdrawal Agreement</p><p>March 21st-22nd – EU Summit</p><p>March 29th – UK Withdrawal Date</p><p>May 23rd-26th – European Parliament Elections</p><p>June 30th – Final date for Brexit, after this the UK must hold EU elections</p><p>July 1st – European Parliament is Selected</p><p>December 31st 2020 – Transition Period ends under the Withdrawal Agreement</p><p><i>Note: these date are subject to change.</i></p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, price action was relatively quiet amid a lack of overnight catalysts and with participants tentative ahead of the upcoming central bank policy meetings including FOMC and BoE. This initially provided <strong>DXY</strong> with a breather from its recent data-driven downtrend in which Industrial and Manufacturing Production numbers on Friday added to the ongoing run of soft releases ranging from jobs numbers to inflation figures, and therefore further supporting a patient view by the Fed. However, the reprieve was short-lived with the greenback later pressured amid the gradual improvement in risk sentiment which underpinned antipodeans to push <strong>AUD/USD</strong> above 0.7100, while<strong> USD/JPY </strong>was also higher but with upside capped by recent <strong>USD</strong>-woes and large option expiries totalling over 1bln at around 111.55-60 for today’s New York cut. Elsewhere, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> was relatively flat at the 1.1300 handle and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was constrained by resistance around 1.3300 with participants bracing themselves for more potential Brexit-related impulses with parliament to possibly vote on PM May’s deal again this week prior to the European Council meeting, although some suggested this could be cancelled if there is not enough support.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures lacklustre after running out of steam having recently hit multi-month highs just shy of the USD 59.00/bbl level and with <strong>Brent</strong> flatlining around USD 67.00/bbl. In addition, participants await comments from the latest OPEC and Non-OPEC monitoring committee today, while the rhetoric ahead of the meeting has shown some differing views with Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih adamant OPEC needs to stay on course regarding the supply cut deal, while his Russian counterpart Novak suggested a decision on future steps by May-June. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was flat as a lack of demand for safe havens was counterbalanced by a lacklustre greenback, while copper benefited from the improved risk appetite as well as gains in <strong>Dalian iron </strong>futures on supply concerns after a Brazilian court ordered for Vale to halt operations at another mine and as the miner suggested a 12mln tons decline in annual output due to dam suspensions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Baker Hughes Rig Count (15 Mar): total rigs -1 at 1026, oil rigs -1 at 833, gas rigs unchanged at 193.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasuries caught a bid on Friday, in a session influenced by both flows and macro themes, where against the grain, equities made healthy gains. The T-plex gained momentum going into the US equity open, with CTA short covering and real money and hedge fund buying kickstarting the rally, also supported by a gloomy outlook from the BoJ on top of North Korea woes, and was exacerbated by the both disappointing Empire Manufacturing survey and Manufacturing/IP data. Once equities opened in the green, Treasuries lost their tailwind as traders took their profits. The curve flattened going into settlement with the belly’s yields falling the most, where the 2s/10s flattened by 2bps. However, spreads in the belly to long-end still remain at their steepest levels in months. US T-note futures (M9) settled 8+ ticks at higher 122-31.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks begin the week with cautious gains as momentum from last Friday’s tech-led upside on Wall St. somewhat faded ahead of this week’s plethora of central bank activity and due to trade uncertainty with the Trump-Xi summit said to be pushed back to June. As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were mixed fore most of early trade with underperformance in telecoms and financials weighing on the Australian bourse, while stocks in Japan remained afloat as participants digested mixed data in which Trade Surplus topped estimates but both Exports and Imports contracted more than expected. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) are positive after the PBoC increased its liquidity efforts and as mainland China eventually recovered from an early whimsical tone caused by uncertainty from the delay of the Trump-Xi summit.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is uneventful amid a lack of catalysts and with participants tentative ahead of the upcoming central bank policy meetings including FOMC and BoE. This has provided the DXY with a breather from its recent data-driven downtrend in which Industrial and Manufacturing Production numbers on Friday added to the ongoing run of soft releases ranging from jobs numbers to inflation figures, and therefore supporting a patient view by the Fed. The greenback’s major counterparts are relatively uneventful with EUR/USD flat at the 1.1300 handle and with GBP/USD contained by resistance around 1.3300 as participants brace themselves for more potential Brexit-related impulses with parliament to possibly vote on PM May’s deal again this week prior to the European Council meeting, although some suggested this could be cancelled if there is not enough support. Elsewhere, the positive risk tone has provided a mild lift for antipodeans, and to a greater extent for JPY-crosses, while USD/JPY is also higher but with upside capped by recent USD-woes and with large option expiries totalling over 1bln at around 111.55-60 for today’s New York cut.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are unchanged with demand dampened by the gains in riskier assets, although downside is also restricted by the BoJ’s presence in the market.</p>",
