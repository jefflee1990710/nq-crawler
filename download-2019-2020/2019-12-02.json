The metal tariffs announcement, which Trump said were a result of Brazil and Argentina deliberately devaluing their currencies, weighed on the dollar, which was already facing additional pressure on a stronger Euro from the growing prospects of higher fiscal spending in Germany, after the left-leaning candidates secures SPD leadership, leading to the Bund's underperformance. On the data front, US manufacturing ISM for November fell further into contraction at 48.1 (exp. 49.2, prev. 48.3), with New Orders also falling, adding to the pessimism which saw major US equity bourses reverse the whole prior week's gains, whilst providing some support to the T-Note, which had been offered earlier in the session. Energy prices remained buoyed following the Chinese data, albeit off highs and below last Friday's peak, leading to the energy sector, alongside the defensive Staples sector, being the only sectors in the green, whilst Industrials, Communications and IT dragged, hence the SPX's relative outperformance compared to the NDQ and DJIA. Further on trade, the WTO ruled that the EU had failed to remove all subsidies on Airbus (AIR FP) in its latest review, providing the US with more ammo to tariff; the US-EU trade front is also of note as participants await a report from the USTR on France's digital tax. The Energy sector led the gains today following a slight rebound from Friday’s heavy sell off, leading to energy specific companies amid the outperformers in the SPX. However, upside in the space was likely capped by a heavy sell off in Apache (APA) as it provided an update which failed to live up to shareholder expectations. The progress report noted it Suriname oil prospect, after digging 6200 meters, required further tests and adjustments to rigs with drilling to resume in October. The update, which many shareholders were reportedly hoping for an oil discovery announcement, saw the stock slide ~15%. Altria (MO) traded firmer following an upgrade at Citi, who in turn downgraded competitor Phillip Morris (PM) as the desk forecasts strong relative upside for MO against PM. S&amp;P 500 -0.9% at 3114, NASDAQ-100 -1.1% at 8309, Dow Jones -1% at 27783.</p><p>Fixed Income was already on the downside this morning post the positive Chinese PMIs, with Bunds leading the sovereigns on potential German fiscal expansion. Although support for the T-Note was found heading into the US session as the manufacturing ISMs continued to fall into contraction and trade woes stirred, particularly with the metal tariffs announcement. The Treasury curve bear steepened on the day, with 2s10s now sitting 6bps wider at 22bps. The disappointing ISM saw the front-end little changed, whereas the 30-year yield rose by approximately 7.5bps. T-note (Z9) futures settled 13 ticks lower at 128-28+.</p>",

On the data front, US manufacturing ISM for November fell further into contraction at 48.1 (exp. 49.2, prev. 48.3), with New Orders also falling, adding to the pessimism which saw major US equity bourses reverse the whole prior week's gains, whilst providing some support to the T-Note, which had been offered earlier in the session. Energy prices remained buoyed following the Chinese data, albeit off highs and below last Friday's peak, leading to the energy sector, alongside the defensive Staples sector, being the only sectors in the green, whilst Industrials, Communications and IT dragged, hence the SPX's relative outperformance compared to the NDQ and DJIA. Further on trade, the WTO ruled that the EU had failed to remove all subsidies on Airbus (AIR FP) in its latest review, providing the US with more ammo to tariff; the US-EU trade front is also of note as participants await a report from the USTR on France's digital tax. China has threatened retaliation to the US, such as sanctions, if the US House passes the bill in condemnation of the Xinjiang region. Looking ahead, Tuesday has a fairly quiet slate on the data front, although the RBA rate decision is due overnight where the bank is expected to keep rates unchanged at 0.75% (AUD trades stronger against the greenback beforehand), with participants looking to Wednesday to digest the US Services ISMs.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>China Global Times noted that the trade deal must include a tariff rollback with Beijing insisting that a pledge to scrap new tariffs in December cannot replace rolling back existing tariffs in a phase one agreement, where there are expectations for at least repealing the September tariffs, too; the continuation of China’s appetite for tariff rollbacks indicates it as a key sticking point in talks. Additional headwinds came to surface over the weekend, the trade deal was said to have stalled due to the Hong Kong legislation, according to reports citing a source close to President Trump's negotiating team, although the article noted the phase one deal would probably happen by year-end at the earliest. Furthermore, China is to take further actions as US interferes in Hong Kong issues, according to CCTV, China have already now sanctioned several US non-government organisations. China's Foreign Ministry has also suspended the review for US maritime vessels visiting Hong Kong. Meanwhile, China Global Times Editor stressed further that China will come up with follow-up actions if US continues to provoke China over Hong Kong; it is worth noting that Hong Kong Police and protestors resumed their clashes over the weekend following the recent lull. China Global Times sources later said China will soon release an “unreliable entity list”, which will contain relevant US entities, adding that the US House being close to passing a Xinjiang-related bill has promoted Beijing to speed up the move; the publication listed three possible counter measures to the signing of the Xinjiang bill: 1) release unreliable entity list to include relevant firms 2) blacklist relevant US people and firms to restrict their entry to China 3) Sanction US politicians backing the bill such as Senator Marco Rubio. Elsewhere US officials gave their familiar rhetoric, where President Trump said China wants to make a deal and will see what happens, adding that the Hong Kong legislation signing doesn’t help the deal; Commerce Secretary Ross stresses on a Fox Business News interview that Trump would boost tariffs if a trade deal is not reached by the middle of the month when the December 15th tariffs are scheduled; advisor Conway said a deal is possible before year-end and that Phase One was being written up.</p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>disappointed across the board for November, where the headline printed 48.1, falling from the prior 48.3 and erasing expectations for a modest bounce to 49.2, marking four consecutive months of contraction. The key, forward-looking New Orders component dipped to 47.2 from 49.1; ISM highlighted that only one of the top six industry sectors was a positive contribution to New Orders, with Transportation Equipment again being the largest drag. Construction Spending printed a surprise decline of 0.8% (exp. +0.4%) and the prior was revised from +0.5% to -0.3%, further adding to the pessimism. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics note that prior to the release, the regional surveys for November were indicating little movement in the national figure, but upside pressures were favoured, albeit ultimately missed. “A charitable interpretation—and one consistent with the recent improvement in China’s PMIs—is that the ISM is bouncing along the bottom,” the consultancy sympathises, adding, “We’d be surprised to see a further significant decline, but the sector is stuck in a mild recession with little prospect of a real near-term revival. This will weigh on job growth and capex over the next few months, to the point where we are not ready to rule out a further easing in January.”</p><p><strong>* CHINA PMI: </strong>In contrast to the US, Chinese Manufacturing PMI for November printed 50.2, above the expected 49.5 and rising out of the prior, contractionary 49.3, marking the first expansion in 7 months. The Non-Manufacturing PMI printed 54.4 (exp. 52.0, prev. 52.8 and strongest in 8 months), Composite PMI 53.7 (prev. 52.0) and the Caixin Manufacturing PMI 51.8 (exp. 51.4, prev. 51.7); an all forecast-beating report at a crucial time for both the state of US-China trade negotiations and concerns for the state of global manufacturing. TD Securities’ analysts highlight that imports and exports still remain in contraction, indicative of the ongoing trade restrictions, although both import and export orders did increase. The NBS noted that the increase in new exports was related to Christmas orders, whilst the growth in import orders was reflective of domestic demand. TD concludes, “While the rise in PMI was somewhat encouraging, it is difficult to get too excited by one month's rebound when so many risks remain. As the sharp 9.9% drop in China's industrial profits in October shows, headwinds to China's manufacturing sector are still significant, not only from US tariffs but also from domestic deflationary forces.”</p><p><strong>* US METALS TARIFFS: </strong>US<strong> </strong>President Trump announced he will be restoring tariffs on all Steel and Aluminium imported from Brazil and Argentina, saying that the countries have been unfairly devaluing their currencies. The announcement comes at a time where China is signing agricultural deals with both Brazil and Argentina, with some desks noting it shows Trump is disappointed with these developments. Brazil has since opposed the devaluation claims, saying it is in discussions with the USTR office and other agencies.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY: </strong>Over the weekend, members of Germany’s SPD, who form part of the ruling coalition with CDU, elected two new left-leaning leaders, Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken. The pair are known critics of the party’s role in the grand-coalition and have pledged to renegotiate the coalition agreement, seeking more “left leaning” policies such as a higher minimum wage, an end to “Black Zero” and changes to the country’s recent climate package. “In recent years we have always seen the SPD ultimately fall into line when it comes to its participating in grand coalitions with the CDU/CSU” notes Rabo, “however, the election of a new leadership in conjunction with the very poor performance of the party in the polls (which is generally put down by party members to their coalition participation) indicates that it could now take a much more assertive position.” In an initial reaction to the outcome of the election, senior officials at the CDU ruled out any re-negotiations and Merkel said that although she is “ready to talk”, re-negotiation is off the table. On Friday, at the SPD’s party conference, Borjans and Esken are expected to be rubber stamped as the new leaders by party delegates, while there will also be a vote on the whether the SPD should remain in the coalition government. As for what comes after that, if the SPD and CDU fail to reach a new agreement, the coalition looks likely to collapse. This could lead to a CDU minority led government, an early election, or the CDU could form a new coalition, perhaps with the Greens of Free Democrats. In every outcome, barring a CDU minority led government, increased spending awaits, as every coalition partner that the CDU could join forces with is demanding spending at higher than current levels; Rabo suggests that either way, Germany looks to have advanced on the path towards more expansive fiscal policy.

Brussels accused the trade body of making “serious legal errors” and called for WTO tariffs awarded to the US to be reduced by USD 2bln. This comes after the WTO awarded the US the right to impose tariffs on USD 7.5bln worth of EU imports due to the subsidies. A USTR spokesperson responded to the report noting the US will consider higher EU tariffs following the ruling, stating the report fond that the EU aid to Airbus (AIR FP) continued to cause adverse effects at the expense of US firms whilst noting strong action is needed, adding US may add other items to the current tariff list. Separately, USTR Lighthizer’s report on the findings of the US’ investigation into France’s proposed digital services tax is expected shortly, with analysts noting that the report could serve as justification for another round of trans-Atlantic tariffs.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB President Lagarde spoke before her first policy decision next week, she offered little new information but again, as expected, spoke of a policy review. On Euro area growth, she noted it remains weak due to global factors and the ECB is ambitious to do and play its part in accordance with its mandate. Lagarde said that a question that is common to the entire community of central banks today is how to best define the medium-term objective of monetary policy, so as to ensure that expectations are firmly anchored. On the review she noted it will start in the near future, highlighting it is premature to venture here into debates about the precise scope, direction and timeline of the review, as the matter has not yet been discussed thoroughly by the Governing Council, although she did suggest the issue of symmetry will be a topic of discussion.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION: </strong>The Conservative Party’s lead over the opposition Labour Party narrowed somewhat over the weekend; polls from YouGov/Sunday Times and Survation/Good Morning Britain had the Tory/Labour differential at 9%, down from 11% the week prior. Other polls from over the weekend showed varying margins of victory for the Conservatives, with Observer showing Conservatives 15 ahead (vs. previous 19), Delta 13 ahead (vs. Prev. 13), ICM 7 ahead (unchanged from prior week), ComRes 10 ahead (vs. Prev. 10) and finally BMG ahead by 6 (vs. Prev. 13). Although the polls have continued to narrow, most still put the Tories more than 7% ahead; YouGov have flagged that if the differential falls below 7%, a hung parliament becomes much more likely. Ladbrokes released an election result (in parliamentary seats) prediction based upon its implied odds betting data and sees the Conservatives gain 342.5, Labour gain 219.5, the SNP gain 44.5 and the Liberal Democrats 18.5, although traders often prefer to look at implied odds from Betfair Exchange or Sporting Index over concerns that Ladbroke odds may be tainted by PR elements. Sporting Index current pricing implies Conservatives will win 340 seats to Labour's 218.</p><p><strong>* FED REPO OPERATIONS: </strong>The NY Fed’s long-term (42 day) repo operation received USD 42.55bln bids on Monday, oversubscribing the offered USD 25bln. This is the Fed's second offering of funding into the new year, where last Monday's operation was also oversubscribed; primary dealers are eager to take advantage of the low-rates offered by the Fed for year-end, where forward GC rates for year-end have been indicating a significant premium to current rates. Meanwhile the daily, overnight operation was undersubscribed, with a total temporary liquidity value of USD 97.9bln added to the financial system.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLES USD 0.79 HIGHER AT USD 55.96/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.43 HIGHER AT USD 60.92/BBL </strong>After a choppy day’s trade, crude markets finished the day on a firmer footing, yet off highs, as the bullish impulses from talk of OPEC+ extending existing production cuts by 400k bpd and strong Chinese PMI data outweighed trade jitters after Trump returned to strike Brazil and Argentina, in addition to weal US Manufacturing ISM data. Front month WTI and Brent contracts advanced as high as USD 56.67/bbl and USD 62.10/bbl from USD 55.00/bbl and USD 60.35/bbl, last Friday’s lows, before paring within the days range. However, it is worth noting that in the context of Friday’s steep decline on month-end, today’s moves were modest, with Friday’s USD 58.27/bbl and USD 63.20/bbl highs still a long way off. In other crude related news, Saudi Arabia raised its January OSP for Arab Light crude to Asia to a USD 3.70 per barrel premium to Oman/Dubai, the Kingdom lowered its January OSP for Northwest Europe to a discount of USD 1.85 per barrel to ICE Brent (previously it was USD 1.80 in December) and left its OSP for the US unchanged at a USD 3.35 per barrel premium to Argus Sour Crude Index. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, current expectations have crude stocks drawing 1.8mln bbls, gasoline building 1.7mln and distillates building by 1.2mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 13 TICKS LOWER AT 128-28+:</strong> Fixed Income was already on the downside this morning post the positive Chinese PMIs, with Bunds leading the sovereigns on potential German fiscal expansion. Although support for the T-Note was found heading into the US session as the manufacturing ISMs continued to fall into contraction and trade woes stirred, particularly with the metal tariffs announcement. The Treasury curve bear steepened on the day, with 2s10s now sitting 6bps wider at 22bps. The disappointing ISM saw the front-end little changed, whereas the 30-year yield rose by approximately 7.5bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.9% at 3114, NASDAQ-100 -1.1% at 8309, Dow Jones -1% at 27783</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.8%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.3%, Energy&nbsp; 0%, Financials&nbsp; -0.7%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.4%, Industrials&nbsp; -1.6%, Information Technology&nbsp; -1.4%, Materials&nbsp; -0.9%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.9%, Utilities&nbsp; -0.8%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The Energy sector led the gains today following a slight rebound from Friday’s heavy sell off, leading to energy specific companies amid the outperformers in the SPX. However, upside in the space was likely capped by a heavy sell off in Apache (APA) as it provided an update which failed to live up to shareholder expectations. The progress report noted it Suriname oil prospect, after digging 6200 meters, required further tests and adjustments to rigs with drilling to resume in October. The update, which many shareholders were reportedly hoping for an oil discovery announcement, saw the stock slide ~15%. Altria (MO) traded firmer following an upgrade at Citi, who in turn downgraded competitor Phillip Morris (PM) as the desk forecasts strong relative upside for MO against PM. The analyst also expects a slower decline in cigarette volume for MO but is doubtful over PM’s multiple expansion. US Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS) benefited after US President Trump tweeted, he is to reimpose steel and aluminium tariffs on Brazil and Argentina. Roku (ROKU) fell over 10% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the company to underweight with a USD 110 price target, implying a 32% downside to Friday’s closing price. The bank believes it will be increasingly difficult to sustain the current premium in its valuation after rising 423% YTD. Biogen (BIIB) traded in the red after a downgrade from Baird, who put the case forwards that its Alzheimer’s drug Aducanumab will not get FDA approval. Deere (DE) was also hit by a downgrade to underperform from Neutral at BAML. Retailers were generally lower to start the week (Macy’s (M) traded higher) following this weekend’s Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales, online orders printed a new record of USD 11.6bln however physical footfall reportedly fell 6.2%.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD sold off gradually throughout the morning session after President Trump announced he would be restoring Steel and Aluminium tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, stating the two have been devaluing their currencies.&nbsp; Selling was exacerbated following the poor ISM data, sending DXY back beneath the 98-handle to lows of 97.80; the Dollar index saw highs of 98.37 prior to the morning sell off. Havens were generally firmer amid poor US data and ongoing US China trade concerns, where participants worry about the potential China retaliation to the Hong Kong and Xinjiang bill. USDJPY continued its sell off post US ISM data to eventually breach 109 to the downside in the tail end of the session. CHF traded firmer against the buck, EUR and GBP, however XAU traded flat to end the US session. Antipodes both firmer to start the week with NZD outperforming after fresh fiscal stimulus from the government, which in turn helped AUD, albeit both also benefitting from a weaker dollar ahead of tonight’s interest rate decision. GBP traded rather subdued as the latest batch of polls put the Conservatives lead on Labour slightly narrowing from previous weeks, however UK final PMI data provided some support following a beat on expectations. EMFX was generally firmer against the buck given the broad dollar weakness, however MXN remained flat against the dollar after the regions Markit Manufacturing PMI fell beneath 50 to 48 from a previous 50.4 reading. BRL and ARS also traded firmer despite Trump’s tariff announcement on two nations who he believes have been devaluing their currencies. However, desks highlight the recent intervention from the BCB around the 4.27 handle to prevent any further weakness, whilst also citing diversified exports as a reason for the Real strength today.</p>",

Front month WTI and Brent contracts advanced as high as USD 56.67/bbl and USD 62.10/bbl from USD 55.00/bbl and USD 60.35/bbl, last Friday’s lows, before paring within the days range. However, it is worth noting that in the context of Friday’s steep decline on month-end, today’s moves were modest, with Friday’s USD 58.27/bbl and USD 63.20/bbl highs still a long way off. In other crude related news, Saudi Arabia raised its January OSP for Arab Light crude to Asia to a USD 3.70 per barrel premium to Oman/Dubai, the Kingdom lowered its January OSP for Northwest Europe to a discount of USD 1.85 per barrel to ICE Brent (previously it was USD 1.80 in December) and left its OSP for the US unchanged at a USD 3.35 per barrel premium to Argus Sour Crude Index. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, current expectations have crude stocks drawing 1.8mln bbls, gasoline building 1.7mln and distillates building by 1.2mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback was already treading cautiously in wake of China sanctioning several US NGOs in response to the HK bill and President Trump restoring import tariffs on steel and aluminium from Argentina and Brazil, but it really lost its footing when November’s manufacturing ISM came in below expectations and construction spending collapsed in October. Moreover, the survey breakdown was bleak and data revised to show a decline in the previous month instead of rise originally reported, with the ISM jobs index deeper below 50.0 ahead Friday’s NFP release. Hence, the Buck was sold broadly and the <strong>DXY </strong>lost grip of 98.000 to a 97.914 low vs 98.379 at best to expose near term support at 97.826 ahead of a November reaction low at 97.678.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to its US counterpart, the Kiwi picked up where it left off last Friday/November with bullish NZ terms of trade providing more impetus alongside fiscal stimulus from the Government for Nzd/Usd to extend gains through 0.6450 and Aud/Nzd declines under 1.0500. However, 0.6466 resistance in the former and 1.0495 support in the latter were convincingly breached when the aforementioned Buck selling picked up pace and Nzd/Usd eclipsed 0.6500. This also helped Aud/Usd clear 0.6800 and contained losses in the cross to circa 1.0473. Elsewhere, Usd/Chf recoiled from parity-plus levels towards 0.9925 and Eur/Usd vaulted 1.1050 on the way to 1.1078 before fading, while Usd/Jpy reversed from just over 109.70 to around 109.10 and looks set to end a 3-day sequence of closes above Fib resistance (109.37).</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>The G10 laggards and underperforming for the most part after more pre-UK election polls showing a narrower gab between the Conservative and Labour parties and with renewed global trade jitters undermining the Loonie. Cable tried to rally with Eur/Usd, but waned before 1.2950 and Eur/Gbp rebounded ahead of 0.8500 to 0.8570+, while Usd/Cad popped above 1.3300 vs a low just shy of 1.3275 at one stage. Note, UK and Canadian manufacturing PMIs diverged against preliminary and forecast respectively, but neither had much impact.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Kronas have had contrasting first trading sessions of December, with Eur/Sek back up through 10.5500 in wake of a more contractionary Swedish manufacturing PMI, but Eur/Nok hovering near the middle of a 10.1100-10.1600 range amidst firmer, albeit well off tops crude prices and a Norwegian manufacturing PMI that held comfortably above 50.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Early weakness vs the Dollar was pared or even reversed, aside from the Cnh, Ars and Mxn that remained rattled by the general and increasing risk averse tone on trade and geopolitical angst, while the Mexican Peso also had a drop in the manufacturing PMI through 50 to contend with.</p>",

Lloyds highlights that the line of questioning for Lagarde will also focus on the outlook for monetary policy and note that the ECB's current view is \"that there is further (limited) scope for additional stimulus, but policy settings seem more likely to be kept on hold for now\".&nbsp;</li><li>This all comes ahead of next week's policy announcement in Frankfurt whereby analysts at HSBC don’t expect any major policy announcements, other than the launch of a mandate review.

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Ruling grand coalition strained by SPD spending demands",
        "content": "<p>* THE LATEST: Over the weekend, members of Germany’s Social Democrat Party (SPD), who form part of the ruling coalition with Chancellor Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union Party (CDU), elected two news left-leaning leaders, Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken. The pair were critical of the party’s role in the grand-coalition and have pledged to renegotiate the coalition agreement, seeking more “left leaning” policies such as a higher minimum wage, and end to “Black Zero” and changes to the country’s recent climate package. “In recent years we have always seen the SPD ultimately fall into line when it comes to its participating in grand coalitions with the CDU/CSU” notes Rabo, “however, the election of a new leadership in conjunction with the very poor performance of the party in the polls (which is generally put down by party members to their coalition participation) indicates that it could now take a much more assertive position.” In an initial reaction to the outcome of the election, senior officials at the CDU ruled out any re-negotiations, although Merkel has since said she is “ready to talk”. On Friday, at the SPD’s party conference, Borjans and Esken are expected to be rubber stamped as the new leaders by party delegates, while there will also be a vote on the whether the SPD should remain in the coalition government.</p><p>* WHAT NEXT: Several possibilities follow the SPD’s party press conference. Firstly, the CDU could make some minor concessions to the SPD in order to keep the coalition alive, possible in stepping up investments and looking at ways to make fiscal policy more flexible. Alternatively, talks could collapse with after the two sides fail to find a middle ground. Under this scenario, the most likely outcome would be for CDU to continue as a minority government, where Merkel would remain Chancellor. Analysts note that the fact that the 2020 Budget has already been passed makes this easier. However, another alternative could be for the CDU may opt to negotiate a new coalition with the environmentally focussed Greens or the pro-business Free Democrats. The three parties held talks after the 2017 election to no avail. However, since 2017, Green support has surged, meaning the party might prefer to press for elections in order to capitalise on recent gains in support. Other desks note how, with elections approaching in 2021, the incentive to negotiate and form a new coalition may be limited given the lack of time to implement policies prior to the next election. That leaves the final possibility of an early election; CDU support has slipped since the last election to 27% from 33%, while Green support has surged to 23% from 8.9%.</p><p>* MARKET IMPACT: The possibility of negotiations between the SPD and CDU yielding an agreement to increase spending has been weighing on the Bund in early Monday trade. Alternatively, if the current coalition was to collapse and lawmakers vote for an early election, higher spending seems inevitable; “it would seem likely that if the CDU/ CSU want to remain in power they will have to enter a coalition with a party/parties who want higher spending” summarises Rabobank, “alternatively, they could opt to be in opposition while a government without them opts to increase spending.”</p>",

Sectors are mostly in the green, led by Energy (+0.7%), in-line with rallying crude prices, while the defensive Utilities (-1.3%) sector is the laggard. In terms of individual mover, Tullow Oil (+4.3%) is the top Stoxx 600 gainer, as reports circulate alleging the Co. has agreed to sell a stake in its Ugandan oil fields. Lufthansa (+1.5%) received a boost on the news that Qatar Airways may be interested in taking a stake in the Co., which could lead to a partnership, although the Co. pushed back on the news stating that the Co. was not privatised in Germany to be nationalised in Qatar. Elsewhere, positive broker moves for Rio Tinto (+0.7%) and EDF (+2.4%) sees the Co.’s shares supported. In terms of the laggards, Hiscox (-3.4%) is set to receive the boot from the FTSE 100 in its quarterly reshuffle on Wednesday, while Fresnillo (-3.7%) and Kingfisher (+1.5%) are also reportedly at risk. easyJet (-0.1%), Just Eat (Unch) and GVC (+1.0%) could be promoted, according to Elsewhere, at the bottom of the FTSE 100 is Ocado (-8.6%), whose shares sunk on the news that the Co. is to issues GBP 500mln worth of bonds which will be convertible into shares as it seeks cash to fund its tech arm’s commitments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - The Kiwi has made a flying start to December on the back of significantly stronger than forecast NZ terms of trade for Q3 that has lifted Nzd/Usd over the 0.6450 mark to test early November resistance (around 0.6466) and nudged the Aud/Nzd cross down through 1.0500 to test Fib support even though the Aussie is also doing well in the G10 arena in wake of encouraging Chinese PMIs, with Aud/Usd climbing above 0.6775 and rebounding towards 0.6800.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD/GBP/JPY</strong> - All softer vs a generally solid Greenback, bar the aforementioned Antipodean Dollar outperformance, as the DXY meanders between 98.272-368 awaiting the full return of US markets/participants from Thanksgiving. Eur/Usd is just maintaining 1.1000+ status with the aid of better than flash or forecast Eurozone PMIs that have offset some of the investor qualms over German politics due to the failed attempt by Finance Minister Scholz to become SPD chief over the weekend. However, more hefty option expiry interest may keep the single currency supressed, as 1.2 bn runs off from 1.0995-1.1000 and a further 1.1 bn between 1.0005-20.

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has made a flying start to December on the back of significantly stronger than forecast NZ terms of trade for Q3 that has lifted Nzd/Usd over the 0.6450 mark to test early November resistance (around 0.6466) and nudged the Aud/Nzd cross down through 1.0500 to test Fib support even though the Aussie is also doing well in the G10 arena in wake of encouraging Chinese PMIs, with Aud/Usd climbing above 0.6775 and rebounding towards 0.6800.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>All softer vs a generally solid Greenback, bar the aforementioned Antipodean Dollar outperformance, as the <strong>DXY </strong>meanders between 98.272-368 awaiting the full return of US markets/participants from Thanksgiving. Eur/Usd is just maintaining 1.1000+ status with the aid of better than flash or forecast Eurozone PMIs that have offset some of the investor qualms over German politics due to the failed attempt by Finance Minister Scholz to become SPD chief over the weekend. However, more hefty option expiry interest may keep the single currency supressed, as 1.2 bn runs off from 1.0995-1.1000 and a further 1.1 bn between 1.0005-20. Elsewhere, the Franc is pivoting parity after Swiss retail sales and the manufacturing PMI both beat consensus, but slowed from previous levels and the Loonie is hovering just above 1.3300 Canada’s manufacturing survey amidst a firm rebound in oil prices that is also helping the <strong>NOK</strong> pare some of its recent declines. Indeed, Eur/Nok has eased back from around 10.1600 vs a more elevated Eur/<strong>SEK </strong>following falls in Norwegian and Swedish manufacturing PMIs (albeit the former still growth vs the latter contracting faster). Meanwhile, Cable continues to labour on the 1.2900 handle, with weekend polls indicating a tighter UK election race and an upward revision to the manufacturing PMI not really providing the Pound with any momentum due to weak sub-components. Similarly, the Yen did not derive much impetus from Japan’s manufacturing headline rebounding closer to 50.0 as Usd/Jpy hovers near the middle of a 109.49-72 range and stays technically bullish after a 3rd close above a key chart level (109.37 Fib).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Depreciation against the Buck almost across the board, with Usd/Cnh hovering around 7.0400 after China’s retaliatory moves in response to the US bill in favour of HK protestors and Usd/Try skirting 5.7600 following scant reaction to a rebound in Turkish GDP or upturn in manufacturing PMI.</p>",

Bears will be eyeing 170.37 next, and this represents a recent base (November 22) that roughly chimes with -30 bp in the cash yield vs circa -30.5 bp at present. Aside from a broad pick-up in risk appetite partly due to better Chinese PMIs overnight, the core Eurozone bond is also on the defensive ahead of November manufacturing PMIs in wake of weekend SPD voting that threatens the German coalition.</p>",

The Chief economist at the Centre for European Reform noted that Walter-Borjans and Esken have been critical of the debt brake but accept that it probably cannot be changed, adding that it is unlikely the coalition will collapse but the SPD will likely make the GroKo more painful for the CDU. (BBC/Twitter)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was slightly firmer overnight with price action relatively stable in comparison to Friday’s failed blitz on the 98.50 level which was also a function of the lighter volumes and reduced trading hours post-Thanksgiving, while its transatlantic peers were mixed as <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> remained relatively unchanged just north of the 1.1000 level and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> dragged closer to 1.2900 after recent polling data showed a narrowing lead for PM Johnson’s Conservatives. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were lifted by the positive risk appetite, while antipodeans also benefitted due to their high-beta characteristics, exposure to China amid the PMI elation and with gains in NZD/USD exacerbated by stronger than expected Terms of Trade data.</p><p>New Zealand Terms of Trade QQ (Q3) 1.9% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 1.6%).

Nonetheless, prices have since recouped some of those losses, as well as the USD 56.00/bbl level with reprieve in the complex coming from the better than expected Chinese PMI data and comments from Iraq’s Oil Minister that suggested OPEC+ will consider deepening cuts by 400k bpd when it meets later this week. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> saw marginal losses amid the lack of safe haven demand and a stable greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> took impetus from the mostly positive tone across stocks and surprise expansion in China’s factory data.</p><p>Iraq’s Oil Minister Ghadhban suggested that OPEC+ producers will consider deepening their existing oil output cuts by about 400k bpd to 1.6mln bpd at their meetings this week. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>T-Notes traded flat on Friday as the complex took its cues in a thin liquidity environment given the early Thanksgiving closure, which also saw a lack of pertinent updates. Treasury futures sold off in the tail-end of the European session, however as the early close approached, some of the losses were pared. By settlement yields were little changed on the day.</p><p>White House lawyer responded that President Trump cannot be fairly expected at December 4th impeachment hearing after the US House judiciary committee deadline passed, while other reports noted that White House lawyers are sceptical about cooperating in the impeachment hearings and instead are focusing on how to prepare for the eventual Senate battle.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets kick-start December on the front-foot with risk appetite stimulated by a flurry of better than expected Chinese PMI in which headline official Manufacturing PMI expanded for the first time in 7-months. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) are higher with Australia led by outperformance in the defensive and financial sectors but with gains limited by the recent slump in oil prices after Russian Energy Minister Novak triggered doubts for a deal extension at this week’s OPEC+ meeting, while the advances in Tokyo are mainly fuelled by a weaker currency. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) welcomed the encouraging PMI data which aside from the headline beat, also showed Non-Manufacturing PMI and Caixin Manufacturing PMI top estimates, although gains are somewhat tempered by continued PBoC inaction, the resumption of violence in Hong Kong protests over the weekend and ongoing trade uncertainty with Beijing said to be insistent on a tariff rollback and as other reports suggested Hong Kong legislation may have stalled the US-China agreement but that a phase one deal would still probably occur by year-end at the soonest.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer overnight with price action relatively stable in comparison to Friday’s failed blitz on the 98.50 level which was also a function of the lighter volumes and reduced trading hours post-Thanksgiving, while its transatlantic peers are mixed as EUR/USD sits relatively unchanged just north of the 1.1000 level and with GBP/USD dragged closer to 1.2900 after the latest polls by YouGov, Panelbase and Survation all showed a narrowing lead for PM Johnson’s Conservatives. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are lifted by the positive risk appetite, while antipodeans also benefit due to their high-beta characteristics, exposure to China amid the PMI elation and with gains in NZD/USD exacerbated by stronger than expected Terms of Trade data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid similar weakness in T-notes and with demand for bonds sapped by the mostly upbeat sentiment, while the BoJ’s presence for a respectable JPY 890bln of JGBs did little to help prices after having slipped through prior support at the 153.00 level.</p>",
