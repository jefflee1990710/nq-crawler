ECB also expects the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key interest rates.</p><p>ECB’s Lagarde said monetary policy must remain highly accommodative, that they will monitor inflation measures and the Governing Council stands ready to adjust instruments as appropriate in line with its commitment to symmetry. Lagarde also noted that she is concerned about low rates which are predicated on low growth and she would much rather have higher rates but it is not the current situation. Furthermore, she stated that underlying inflation, despite being low, has stabilised or ticked up slightly and that inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, while she noted that data points to some stabilisation but risks remain tilted to the downside.</p><p>French Finance Minister Le Maire said they have reached an agreement with the US regarding the basis for digital tax discussions at next week's OECD, while he added the US proposal for the future tax deal to be optional has been taken off of the table.

Morgan Stanley also upgraded Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) upon assessing a more optimistic outlook for the memory market, seeing both stocks open higher, although the latter did reverse course through the session. Ford (F) was offered after announcing a USD 2.2bln pre-tax loss following pension expenses. Paycom Software (PAYC) caught a bid after it was announced it would be replacing WellCare (WCG) in the S&amp;P 500 on completion of the Centene (CNC) merger. PG&amp;E (PCG) surged after reaching a deal with its bondholders to move forward with its reorganization plan. L Brands (LB) was supported by an upgrade at Barclays.

SPX +0.11% AT 3226; DOW -0.09% AT 29,160; NDX +0.31% AT 9217.</p><p>The TPLEX ultimately flattened, albeit off lows, as risk appetite proved volatile. The curve saw pronounced bull-flattening as US participants came to their desks and digested the wider risk aversion globally amid the coronavirus outbreaks, although the bidding eased heading into the later session, assisted by the WHO announcing it would not be declaring an international health emergency. By settlement, the 2-year yield was little changed whilst the 30-year yield fell by around 3.5bps – note it had fallen by 10bps earlier in the session. Attention now moves to Friday’s Flash PMIs to provide an updated view of economic activity, with manufacturing in Europe expected to rise slightly, albeit still in contractionary, whilst the US is expected to remain resilient in expansionary territory for both components. US T-note futures (H0) settled 7+ ticks higher at 129-25.</p>",

However, the panel was split by 50/50 on the decision, but announced it may revisit this later on. The WHO announced that currently there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China, that it has yet to become a global emergency. Note that by declaring a PHEIC designation, global travel and trade could be affected, although the organization does not recommend any further precautions than already exist. As the cases increase in China with multiple cities halting public transport out of the city, and as the death toll increases, Beijing announced it will be cancelling Lunar New year celebrations, which is normally a major time for consumer spending. Analysts at SocGen write \"Markets have become concerned about the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan. Clearly, there is still considerable uncertainty as to how the situation will evolve. However, the SARS epidemic in 2003, which lasted for nine months and infected over 5,000 people in China, should be a useful reference for the potential economic impact this time. Drawing from the SARS lesson, if the situation has failed to stabilise by March, 1Q GDP growth will likely fall below 6%, compared with our current forecast of 6.1%. Undoubtedly, consumption and tourism-related sectors would be most affected.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>As expected, the ECB maintained monetary policy settings, keeping all three key rates unchanged, while reiterating forward guidance on rates and asset purchases. Alongside the 1245 GMT policy release, the Bank also flagged that details on the scope and timetable of the review were to be published after the press conference; press release can be found here. With the initial policy announcement causing little in the way of a market reaction, focus turned towards the press conference, whereby President Lagarde presented the Bank’s current assessment of the Eurozone economy. The ECB head noted that incoming data was in line with the baseline scenario of ongoing but moderate growth. Lagarde also noted that data points have seen some stabilisation (vs. prev. remarks of “some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown”), before reiterating that “risks remain tilted to the downside but are less pronounced”. Note, Lagarde was asked if there was discussion on changing the GC’s assessment to a more “balanced” view, to which she noted that there is “always” a discussion on the balance of risks, while avoiding providing details on how that discussion unfolded. From an inflation perspective, some focus was placed on commentary stating that underlying inflation, while low, has stabilised, or “ticked up slightly”. However, inferences on how exactly the ECB will interpret fluctuations in inflation rates have been somewhat clouded by the upcoming strategic review. With regards to the strategic review, Lagarde took a diplomatic route, rebuffing questions focused on her specific thoughts towards certain elements of the review (e.g. should the ECB take a symmetrical approach to inflation targeting), with the Chief not wanting to have her viewpoints sway the focus of the review; a move likely dictated by her aim to impose a more harmonious approach to the decision-making process. In terms of the duration of the review, Lagarde expects to announce the findings around November/December. From a rates perspective, the President was quizzed on how the GC assesses the impact of negative rates, to which she stated that she was “concerned” about low rates; however, she was careful to qualify this statement by noting that low rates are predicated on low growth, and therefore, she would favour higher rates as that would be more indicative of higher growth. Overall, markets were presented with little in the way of new information for the future path of monetary policy at the Bank, as focus in Frankfurt shifts towards the upcoming strategic review which could eventually shift the parameters in which the ECB operates.</p><p><strong>* US/EUROPE TRADE:</strong> US Commerce Secretary Ross reiterated the US’ working assumption is that a trade deal can be made with Europe although it is more complicated than China. Ross added he hopes to reach a trade deal with UK this year, whilst Mnuchin highlighted it is President Trump is focused on trade with the UK and EU this year. On the digital tax, French Finance Minister Le Maire announced the two sides came to an agreement on the discussions to be had at next week’s OECD, however the US proposal for a future tax deal to be optional has been taken off the table. France announced the two sides are making progress and talks are moving in the right direction.</p><p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS: (W/E 18thJan): </strong>The survey week which feeds into the payroll report decreased to 211k from the prior months 235k. The 4-week average also ticked down to 213.25 from the December’s survey period of 225.75k, faring better for the January jobs report. Pantheon Macroeconomic mention today’s report only adds to their case that the trend may perhaps be falling again. Continuing jobless claims declined from the prior, however the consultancy highlights this as no surprise the continuing claims tends to follow the headline jobless claims, which spiked in early December.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.15 LOWER AT USD 55.59/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 1.17 LOWER AT USD 62.04/BBL:</strong> Energy prices were hit on both sides of the market – demand was hit with wider risk appetite on the coronavirus and supply-glut concerns grew elsewhere. The oil benchmarks were already on the backfoot overnight and in the European session as it became evident that more cities in China had been locked down due to coronavirus concerns; some desks have attributed around a 0.2mln-0.3mln BPD decline in consumption as a result of the virus outbreak, for what it’s worth – Citigroup says the sell-off is being exacerbated by a large wave of speculative long liquidation. Additional selling pressure was exerted on the news that Saudi and Kuwait would resume production at the Hafji oil field (300k BPD), located in the previously disputed neutral zone, by the end of February. Note that the strong sell-off set the complex up for a nice bounce on the release of the EIA report (bbls): crude stocks -0.4mln, smaller than the expected -1mln but counter to the private report of +1.6mln, distillates printed a surprise draw and gasoline a smaller than expected build, where the private report indicated chunky builds in the products; Cushing stocks also printed a large than previously reported draw; US production remained at 13mln BPD. Although the EIA report brought the energy complex off its lows, the losses were still firm, although Friday’s Flash PMIs could alter the demand/risk sentiment. Elsewhere on the OPEC-front, OPEC's Secretary General Barkindo said, according to Tass, that it is too early to talk about extending OPEC+ global oil output deal until the end of this year; this followed on from earlier comments from Saudi Energy Minister saying all options are open in the OPEC+ meeting in March, including further cuts, reported by local press.</p><p>*<strong> US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-25. </strong>The<strong> </strong>TPLEX ultimately flattened, albeit off lows, as risk appetite proved volatile. The curve saw pronounced bull-flattening as US participants came to their desks and digested the wider risk aversion globally amid the coronavirus outbreaks, although the bidding eased heading into the later session, assisted by the WHO announcing it would not be declaring an international health emergency. By settlement, the 2-year yield was little changed whilst the 30-year yield fell by around 3.5bps – note it had fallen by 10bps earlier in the session. Attention now moves to Friday’s Flash PMIs to provide an updated view of economic activity, with manufacturing in Europe expected to rise slightly, albeit still in contractionary, whilst the US is expected to remain resilient in expansionary territory for both components.</p><p><strong>* STOCK CLOSES: </strong>SPX +0.11% AT 3226; DOW -0.09% AT 29,160; NDX +0.31% AT 9217</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Comcast (CMCSA) took a haircut, despite a beat on EPS and Revenue, after it recorded a larger drop in video customers than expected – competitor Netflix (NFLX) caught a bid on easing competition concerns. Both Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG) and Travelers (TRV) disappointed on a revenue miss, weighing on the Dow. Texas Instruments (TXN) beat top and bottom line estimates, citing a bottoming out of demand, although guidance was mediocre, seeing the stock open lower. American Airlines (AAL) reversed earlier losses, despite reporting slight misses on profit and revenue, as well as lacklustre guidance; the Co stressed that it had 737 MAX issues under control and had planned accordingly. Southwest Airlines (LUV) also reversed earlier losses, despite a profit miss; note that both LUV and AAL were likely supported by gains in BA, which was boosted by some unconfirmed activist chatter, with Ackman’s name being touted. VF Corp (VFC) traded around 10% lower after a revenue miss and cutting its guidance. Citrix Systems (CTXS) surged on a top and bottom line beat, as well as an additional USD 1bln share repurchase programme. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was hit, where even though it beat expectations on profit, analysts were less persuaded on its production figures. Kinder Morgan (KMI) traded higher on a profit beat.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> General Electric (GE) traded firmer after an upgrade to Overweight at Morgan Stanley, citing optimism on 2021 FCF. Morgan Stanley also upgraded Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) upon assessing a more optimistic outlook for the memory market, seeing both stocks open higher, although the latter did reverse course through the session. Ford (F) was offered after announcing a USD 2.2bln pre-tax loss following pension expenses. Paycom Software (PAYC) caught a bid after it was announced it would be replacing WellCare (WCG) in the S&amp;P 500 on completion of the Centene (CNC) merger. PG&amp;E (PCG) surged after reaching a deal with its bondholders to move forward with its reorganization plan. L Brands (LB) was supported by an upgrade at Barclays. Casinos (WYNN, LVS, MLCO, MGM) were hit as Macau authorities announced casino closures might be required amid the coronavirus outbreak; other related names (CCL, RCL, YUM, BABA, JD) were also laggards.</p><p><strong>* NORGES: </strong>Norges Bank, as expected, left rates unchanged at 1.5% today. The accompanying remarks were largely reiterations of December’s MPR, or confirmations of views from that report. Going into the meeting there was focus on whether the NOK’s recent strength as well as the slightly softer data would prompt a dovish-tweak to the rate path i.e. the removal/reduction of the minor hiking bias. As the language around path was retained from the December meeting, suggesting that rates at to remain at present levels in the coming period, which indicates that the Norges Bank either do not see the developments as sufficient to prompt a tweak now or are perhaps waiting until the March MPR to do so. Reaction in the NOK was some marginal strength, perhaps on the aforementioned retention of the hiking bias. Rate forecasts aside, the release was more upbeat noting that risks of a downturn to the global economy have receded and that capacity utilisation is above normal levels; albeit, approach a cyclical peak. Overall, the remarks indicate that the mild hiking bias is here to stay, unless the data and currency situation deteriorate further from a rates perspective; focus now turns to the Q1 regional network report and subsequent March monetary policy report for further insight.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> regained ground back above its 200dma of 97.71 amid an improvement in jobless claims, however LEI missed expectations and the buck resides around the figure heading into Asia trade. <strong>GBP</strong> pared back some of the prior day gains however remains above the 1.31 figure ahead of tomorrow’s Markit PMI survey. <strong>CAD</strong> traded around post BoC levels towards the end of the session after USDCAD printed highs of 1.3171 in the early morning and now resides beneath 1.3150. EUR sold off post ECB despite being unreactive during the rate decision itself but was choppy during the press conference. <strong>AUD</strong> initially performed well on a decent jobs report, however the gains pared back on coronavirus worries. <strong>NZD</strong> trades within a whisker of the 0.66 figure against the buck. <strong>JPY</strong> &amp; <strong>XAU</strong> were bid amid coronavirus concerns, with USDJPY remaining beneath 110 around 109.50, and XAU above 1560. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally weaker against the buck, with ZAR weaker on reports of unplanned outages increasing at Eskom. <strong>MXN</strong> lower on a suspected coronavirus case in the country. <strong>BRL</strong> the outperformer and traded firmer amid an increase in tax revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The oil benchmarks were already on the backfoot overnight and in the European session as it became evident that more cities in China had been locked down due to coronavirus concerns; some desks have attributed around a 0.2mln-0.3mln BPD decline in consumption as a result of the virus outbreak, for what it’s worth – Citigroup says the sell-off is being exacerbated by a large wave of speculative long liquidation. Additional selling pressure was exerted on the news that Saudi and Kuwait would resume production at the Hafji oil field (300k BPD), located in the previously disputed neutral zone, by the end of February. Note that the strong sell-off set the complex up for a nice bounce on the release of the EIA report (bbls): crude stocks -0.4mln, smaller than the expected -1mln but counter to the private report of +1.6mln, distillates printed a surprise draw and gasoline a smaller than expected build, where the private report indicated chunky builds in the products; Cushing stocks also printed a large than previously reported draw; US production remained at 13mln BPD. Although the EIA report brought the energy complex off its lows, the losses were still firm, although Friday’s Flash PMIs could alter the demand/risk sentiment. Elsewhere on the OPEC-front, OPEC's Secretary General Barkindo said, according to Tass, that it is too early to talk about extending OPEC+ global oil output deal until the end of this year; this followed on from earlier comments from Saudi Energy Minister saying all options are open in the OPEC+ meeting in March, including further cuts, reported by local press.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Yen has overtaken the Aussie at the top of the major league amidst a more pronounced bout of risk aversion as the number of Chinese coronavirus cases/casualties continues to rise and the outbreak traverses further across the globe. Usd/Jpy has now retreated through 109.50 and is probing beneath the 21 DMA (109.35), while Gold extended its rebound from recent sub-Usd 1550/oz lows to Usd 1560+. Conversely, Aud/Usd has pared back from post-Aussie jobs data peaks close to the 200 DMA (0.6880) and Aud/Nzd has reversed below 1.0400, as the Kiwi hovers near 0.6600 ahead of NZ inflation due just before Australian PMIs.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>All weaker vs the Greenback, but with the Loonie trying to regroup around the 1.3150 mark after falling further post-BoC and only arresting the slide a few pips off the 100 DMA, while dovish SNB commentary from SNB head Jordan has offset a degree of safe-haven demand for the Franc, as Usd/Chf edges towards 0.9700 again in contrast to Eur/Chf that is approaching fresh multi-year lows just above 1.0700, albeit on a sharp recoil in Eur/Usd from fleeting 1.1100+ highs. Indeed, the single currency is now the outright G10 underperformer after breaching key technical support at 1.1060 (50% retrace of whole Q4 2019 move) and now eyeing the 1.1040-30 area that includes the 6 December 2019 trough. The Euro derived fleeting bullish impetus from fractionally firmer underlying inflation assertions in ECB President Lagarde’s post-meeting press conference, but then turned tail when she refrained from divulging any details about the strategic review and the official release failed to provide more than broad strokes and aims for the process that is expected to take almost a year to complete, or be ready for unveiling by December, according to the new chief. Conversely, the broad US Dollar benefited at the expense of the common currency’s demise and knock-on depreciation elsewhere, like Cable grinding down from circa 1.3150 to a few pips shy of 1.3100, and the <strong>DXY </strong>crossed the 200 DMA (97.720) more convincingly as a result after surpassing Fib resistance (97.620) in the process.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Norwegian and Swedish Crowns have been relatively impervious to the aforementioned China-related risk off sentiment and another sharp decline in crude prices, with assistance from a neutral/on hold Norges Bank rather than dovish-leaning that some suspected and encouraging jobs data respectively. However, Usd/EM pairs are rebounding almost across the board in line with ongoing Yuan weakness, as the Cnh slips under 6.9400.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.</li><li>The Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council expects them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.</li><li>The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.</li><li>The Governing Council also decided to launch a review of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. Further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release today at 15:30 CET.</li><li>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.mp200123~ae33d37f6e.en.html\">Link</a></li></ul>",

Furthermore, it was reported that China shutdown public transit as well as the airport in Wuhan to contain the spread of the virus and local doctors estimated the number of cases could reach as many as 6000, in which the related jitters kept markets on edge and overshadowed the upward revision to Chinese December trade data, as well as the PBoC’s targeted medium-term lending facility announcement.

Sectors are mixed with defensives performing slightly better than cyclicals, and with underperformance seen in the consumer discretionary sector – heavily weighed on by Renault (-4.2%), following a downgrade at Citi. In terms of other individual movers, STMicroelectronics (+7.3%) leads the gains in the Stoxx600 following an upbeat earnings report in which it also stated that it will invest USD 1.5bln in Capex to support strategic initiatives. Sticking with upside, Novozymes (+6.4%) remains a top-gainer post-earnings in which it announced a share buyback programme.

To recap, December’s payroll count beat consensus almost 2-fold, and while entirely due to the part-time tally, the jobless rate dipped to 5.1% and prompted at least a couple of local banks to roll-back RBA rate cut forecasts. Meanwhile, the Yen has made a more concerted break above 110.00 vs the Buck towards 109.50 amidst renewed qualms over the spreading Chinese coronavirus and further retracement in the Renminbi through 6.9000 to 6.9330+.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/EUR/CHF/SEK/NOK - </strong>All holding relatively steady vs the Usd, as the DXY continues to dither either side of 97.500 rather aimlessly awaiting further direction and/or independent impetus that may come via weekly claims and the LEI. On that note, Nzd/Usd remains retrained just below 0.6600 ahead of Q4 NZ CPI that will feed into February’s RBNZ policy meeting considerations, while Cable is still capped circa 1.3150 before Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs and following mixed data/surveys since several BoE members, including Governor Carney, revealed dovish leanings along the lines of existing MPC dissenters Saunders and Haskel. Conversely, Eur/Usd is not anticipating much from the upcoming ECB confab other than information about the strategic review, with the pair meandering under 1.1100, but keeping afloat of key support levels that kick in from 1.1070. Elsewhere, SNB chair Jordan has backed up Maechler’s insistence that being labelled as a currency fixer by the US will not impact policy, adding that NIRP and FX interventions are still necessary as the Franc remains highly valued.

        "content": "<ul><li>Crude has extended the recent downside on Thursday, with the Coronavirus being cited for the falls, given the growth concerns that follow, and China banning travel in and out of Wuhan (the ground zero, which houses 11mln people), which is said to weigh on fuel demand ahead of the Lunar New Year (where travel plans over the holidays amount to the largest human migration).</li><li>While some desks have draw comparisons to the SARS virus in 2003, which trimmed 0.15ppts off of global growth, some believe that the comparisons may be slightly unfair. The latest edition of The Economist, for instance, notes key differences: the Chinese response has been better for Coronavirus than for SARS, as well as the death rate being significantly lower for Coronavirus than SARS. Additionally, the Chinese have worked with international authorities more rapidly, and have quarantined Wuhan -- suggesting that, for now, Coronavirus may fare better than SARS did. SocGen thinks that if the episode continues beyond March, Chinese growth could fall beneath 6.0%.&nbsp;</li><li>Amid these concerns, however, desks warn that supply concerns should not be dismissed. ING notes the situation in Libya has the potential to hit output by around 1.1mln BPD; disruptions are still possible in Iraq, the second largest OPEC producer. Additionally, there are now concerns after Kazakhstan haled flows to China due to contamination issues (flows to China averaged 300k BPD in 2018), while Shell has declared a force majeure on exports of Bonny Light from Nigeria, shittering 150k BPD of flows through the Nembe Creek pipeline. These disruptions total around 1.4mln BPD, ING notes, which would be more than enough to shift the global market into deficit over 1H20.</li><li>\"Spare capacity appears to be a key factor which is keeping a lid on prices, with OPEC holding in excess of 3mln BPD of spare capacity. However there are still plenty of supply risks in the market, and given the recent instability in Iraq, this is a growing supply risk.\" ING says that while the market may shrug at supply losses from Libya, it would be more difficult for the market to ignore large Iraqi supply losses.\"</li><li>Elsewhere, the API reported crude build of +1.6mln (exp. -1mln, prev. +1.1mln), Cushing -0.43mln (prev. 0mln), Gasoline +4.5mln (exp. +3.1mln, prev. +3.2mln), Distillates +3.5mln (exp. +1mln, prev. +6.8mln).</li><li><strong>KEY LEVELS: </strong>Broker PVM warns that the five-day range for crudes is wide, and that could mean that any rallied could be 'sellable'. In terms of the key levels to watch, PVM identifies <strong>WTI </strong>support at 55.55, and says that a market close below this level would open the door to 54.48; Above, PVM focusses on 56.13/20, and then 56.64 (a region to sell, PVM says). <strong>Brent </strong>is similar; PVM says a market closebeneath 62.03 would be a sell for the next leg lower to the 61.32, and potentially lower, while resistance is not serious till 62.93 then 63.32, with both being regions for to sell, from a technical perspective.</li></ul>",

Sectors are mixed with defensives performing slightly better than cyclicals, and with underperformance seen in the consumer discretionary sector – heavily weighed on by Renault (-4.2%), following a downgrade at Citi. In terms of other individual movers, STMicroelectronics (+7.3%) leads the gains in the Stoxx600 following an upbeat earnings report in which it also stated that it will invest USD 1.5bln in Capex to support strategic initiatives. Sticking with upside, Novozymes (+6.4%) remains a top-gainer post-earnings in which it announced a share buyback programme. On the flip side, miners including the likes of Rio Tinto (-2.1%), Antofagasta (-2.8%) and BHP (-1.6%) bear the brunt of softer base metal prices. Broker-induced action includes Maersk (+1.1%), Compass Group (-1.6%) and Continental (-1.3%).</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/JPY - The marked G10 outperformers, as the Aussie rebounds firmly against the Greenback and Kiwi on the back of better than expected jobs data, albeit largely seasonal, to test resistance around the 200 DMA (0.6880) and reclaim 1.0400+ status respectively. To recap, December’s payroll count beat consensus almost 2-fold, and while entirely due to the part-time tally, the jobless rate dipped to 5.1% and prompted at least a couple of local banks to roll-back RBA rate cut forecasts. Meanwhile, the Yen has made a more concerted break above 110.00 vs the Buck towards 109.50 amidst renewed qualms over the spreading Chinese coronavirus and further retracement in the Renminbi through 6.9000 to 6.9330+.</p><p>NZD/GBP/EUR/CHF/SEK/NOK - All holding relatively steady vs the Usd, as the DXY continues to dither either side of 97.500 rather aimlessly awaiting further direction and/or independent impetus that may come via weekly claims and the LEI. On that note, Nzd/Usd remains retrained just below 0.6600 ahead of Q4 NZ CPI that will feed into February’s RBNZ policy meeting considerations, while Cable is still capped circa 1.3150 before Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs and following mixed data/surveys since several BoE members, including Governor Carney, revealed dovish leanings along the lines of existing MPC dissenters Saunders and Haskel. Conversely, Eur/Usd is not anticipating much from the upcoming ECB confab other than information about the strategic review, with the pair meandering under 1.1100, but keeping afloat of key support levels that kick in from 1.1070. Elsewhere, SNB chair Jordan has backed up Maechler’s insistence that being labelled as a currency fixer by the US will not impact policy, adding that NIRP and FX interventions are still necessary as the Franc remains highly valued. Moreover, rates may yet be required to be more negative, leaving Usd/Chf idling between 0.9674-93 and Eur/Chf nudging the top of a 1.0730-47 band.

To recap, December’s payroll count beat consensus almost 2-fold, and while entirely due to the part-time tally, the jobless rate dipped to 5.1% and prompted at least a couple of local banks to roll-back RBA rate cut forecasts. Meanwhile, the Yen has made a more concerted break above 110.00 vs the Buck towards 109.50 amidst renewed qualms over the spreading Chinese coronavirus and further retracement in the Renminbi through 6.9000 to 6.9330+.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/EUR/CHF/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>All holding relatively steady vs the Usd, as the <strong>DXY</strong> continues to dither either side of 97.500 rather aimlessly awaiting further direction and/or independent impetus that may come via weekly claims and the LEI. On that note, Nzd/Usd remains retrained just below 0.6600 ahead of Q4 NZ CPI that will feed into February’s RBNZ policy meeting considerations, while Cable is still capped circa 1.3150 before Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs and following mixed data/surveys since several BoE members, including Governor Carney, revealed dovish leanings along the lines of existing MPC dissenters Saunders and Haskel. Conversely, Eur/Usd is not anticipating much from the upcoming ECB confab other than information about the strategic review, with the pair meandering under 1.1100, but keeping afloat of key support levels that kick in from 1.1070. Elsewhere, SNB chair Jordan has backed up Maechler’s insistence that being labelled as a currency fixer by the US will not impact policy, adding that NIRP and FX interventions are still necessary as the Franc remains highly valued. Moreover, rates may yet be required to be more negative, leaving Usd/Chf idling between 0.9674-93 and Eur/Chf nudging the top of a 1.0730-47 band. Turning to Scandinavia, Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok are pivoting 10.5400 and 9.9600 respectively, with the Swedish Crown deriving some support from a significant decline in jobless rates and Norwegian Krona acknowledging broadly unchanged assessments and guidance for steady depo rates from the Norges Bank.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The major laggard and still smarting after Wednesday’s dovish/cautious BoC outlook that was underscored by Governor Poloz stating that easing is now an option depending on how data unfolds and the domestic economy develops rather than a pre-emptive cut that was discussed. The Loonie has nursed some losses after sliding to circa 1.3170, though Usd/Cad remains above 1.3150 and still prone to extending gains towards upside chart targets ahead of 1.3200, such as the 100 DMA (1.3179).</p>",

Furthermore, it was reported that China shutdown public transit as well as the airport in Wuhan to contain the spread of the virus and local doctors estimated the number of cases could reach as many as 6000, in which the related jitters kept markets on edge and overshadowed the upward revision to Chinese December trade data, as well as the PBoC’s targeted medium-term lending facility announcement.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>Ex-Divs</strong>: No FTSE 100 companies will TRADE ex-dividend today.

(-2.7%)</strong> slumped with investors reducing exposure heading into the start of the week-long mainland holiday closure and tomorrow’s shortened session in Hong Kong as focus centred on the outbreak concerns, with losses for the mainland bourse exacerbated on a break below the psychological 3000 level. Furthermore, it was reported that China shutdown public transit as well as the airport in Wuhan to contain the spread of the virus and local doctors estimated the number of cases could reach as many as 6000, in which the related jitters kept markets on edge and overshadowed the upward revision to Chinese December trade data, as well as the PBoC’s targeted medium-term lending facility announcement. Finally, 10-year JGBs were higher and tracked similar upside in T-notes with prices supported by the risk averse tone and with the BoJ present in the market today heavily concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC skipped reverse repos but announced CNY 240.5bln1-year targeted medium-term lending facility as expected, with the rate kept unchanged at 3.15% despite some press speculation China may offer the TMLF at a lower rate. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 6.8876 vs. Exp. 6.8861 (Prev. 6.8853)</strong></p><p>US President Trump tweeted praise for the China trade deal in which he stated that it will bring both the US &amp; China closer together in so many other ways and suggested there is much more to come. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>China confirmed 571 total cases of the new coronavirus and the number of deaths from the virus was reported at 17,</strong> while China's Wuhan closed public transit and its airport to contain the spread of the virus. In separate reports, local doctors in Wuhan were said to estimate the number of coronavirus cases could reach as high as 6000 and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission is said to prepare at least 5400 hospital beds for potential patients. (Newswires/Caixin)</p><p>China Global Times tweeted that the Chinese Embassy in France have contacted a person and informed the local emergency department to handle her case after she had entered France and posted on social media that she had a fever &amp; cough. In related news, there were earlier comments from the WHO that it has not seen third or fourth generation transmission of coronavirus in China or secondary level spread in countries where it has been exported to. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>China revised USD-denominated trade figures for December with the Trade Balance surplus revised to USD 47.21bln from USD 46.79bln</strong>, Exports Y/Y revised to 7.9% from 7.6% and Imports Y/Y revised to 16.5% from 16.3%.

(City AM)</p><p>EU Commission President von der Leyen may visit Washington early next month according to EU head of delegation. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was relatively unchanged and remained near 97.50 amid mixed trade in its major counterparts including the extended weakness in <strong>CAD</strong> following a dovish hold by the BoC. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> were lacklustre and have retreated from resistance at 1.1100 and 1.3150 respectively, although the latter still held onto most of the recent gains spurred by the strong UK CBI Trends release. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> extended further below 110.00 on safe-haven flows, while antipodeans traded higher with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> boosted by better than expected Employment data which despite being solely fuelled by Part-Time jobs, still resulted to a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.1% from 5.2%. This subsequently dampened calls for the RBA to resume its easing cycle next month with markets now pricing around an 80% chance of the RBA to remain on hold vs. Prev. probabilities of a near coin-flip, while ANZ Bank also dropped its forecast for a 25bps cut at the upcoming meeting and CBA pushed back its rate cut projection from February to April.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Australian Employment Change (Dec) 28.9k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 39.9k)</strong></p><p><strong>Australian Full Time Employment Change (Dec) -0.3k (Prev. 4.2k)</strong></p><p><strong>Australian Unemployment Rate (Dec) 5.1% vs. Exp. 5.2% (Prev. 5.2%)</strong></p><p><strong>Fitch affirmed New Zealand's foreign currency IDR at AA: Outlook revised to Positive from Stable.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SNB's Maechler says being put on the US' currency watchlist will not change SNB policy; will end negative interest rates as soon as possible. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BoC Governor Poloz said the door is obviously open to an interest rate cut but noted that calculations on such would have to be data dependent and that interest rates are still really low</strong>. Furthermore, Poloz commented that some of the downside risks identified in October have clearly landed and the sense of whether we need easing are obviously present in the analysis, while he added if we had a cut in the future it would not be against a hypothetical or a possibility. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mostly subdued amid the risk averse tone in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures extended on the prior session’s losses that were attributed to coronavirus concerns and the likely impact on travel as well as energy demand, while oil prices were further pressured by a bearish private inventory report which showed a surprise build in headline crude stockpiles to drag Brent and WTI crude futures below USD 63.00/bbl and USD 56.00/bbl respectively. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was rangebound and failed to benefit from the safe haven bid amid a steady greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> was kept lacklustre from the broad risk averse tone and sell-off in China.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 17th Jan) +1.6mln vs. Exp. -1mln (Prev. +1.1mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs said the main headwind for gasoline and distillates this year will be from high available refining capacity, while it added that recent weakening in fundamentals amid near-record high net speculative positioning points to further downside risk. (Newswires)</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US special representative to Iran Brian Hook warned that new Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Commander Ghaani will face the same fate as his predecessor Soleimani if he follows in the same path. (Al Arabiya)</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>A rather lacklustre session for the TPLEX regarding price action, where the T-Note came off its lows modestly from the earlier session; by settlement, yields were little changed with the 10-year at 1.77%. Participants have had little data to dig into out of the US ahead of Friday’s PMIs, with the ECB meeting (on Thursday) and Fed meeting next week expected to be mainly non-events, whilst US earnings have not set off any alarm signals on the strength of the US economy. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has been drifting lower for the past few weeks closer to its multi-month, key support level of approximately 1.7%, this week’s outbreak of coronavirus has only supported the move. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 tick lower at 129-17+.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets weakened across the board following the indecisive performance on Wall St where stocks finished relatively flat in a pullback from fresh record highs amid ongoing coronavirus fears with the total confirmed cases in China now at 571 and number of deaths at 17. ASX 200 (-0.8%) is dragged lower by heavy losses in Industrials including Downer EDI after lowering its profit guidance and with CIMIC anticipating a significant impact from its plan to exit its stake in BICC, with better than expected jobs data also dampening calls for an RBA rate cut next month. Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) is subdued with the index pressured by a firmer currency and weaker than expected trade data including a wider than expected decline in exports, while Hang Seng (-1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) conform to the downbeat sentiment as focus centres on the outbreak concerns which has prompted a shutdown of public transit and the airport in Wuhan to contain the spread of the virus. Furthermore, it was reported that local doctors were said to estimate the number of cases could reach as many as 6000 in which the related jitters kept markets on edge and overshadowed the upward revision to Chinese December trade data, as well as the PBoC’s targeted medium-term lending facility announcement.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively unchanged and bides its time near the 97.50 level amid mixed trade in its major counterparts including the extended weakness in CAD following a dovish hold by BoC which dropped its reference of the key rate being “appropriate” and suggested growth in the near term will be weaker and the output gap wider than projected in October. Conversely, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are steady with upside limited by resistance at 1.1100 and 1.3150 respectively, although the latter still holds on to the majority of the recent gains spurred by the strong UK CBI Trends figures. Elsewhere, USD/JPY extends further below the 110.00 handle on safe-haven flows, while antipodeans are higher with AUD/USD boosted by better than expected Employment data which despite being solely fuelled by Part-Time jobs, still resulted to a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.1% from 5.2% and subsequently dampened calls RBA to resume its easing cycle next month with ANZ Bank no longer forecasting a 25bps cut at the upcoming meeting.</p><p>Finally, 10-year JGBs are higher and track similar upside in T-notes with prices supported by the risk averse tone and with the BoJ’s presence in the market today heavily concentrated on 5yr-10yr JGBs.</p>",
