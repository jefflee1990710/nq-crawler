(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Markets moved sideways to end the week on Friday experiencing some choppy tape action amid trade updates, albeit ranges were thin. There were further comments directly from President Trump that there was no decision yet made on rolling back tariffs which saw a kneejerk risk-off reaction across major asset classes. McDonald’s (MCD) shares were supported on an upgrade to Buy from Neutral at Longbow; the analyst noted the Co. is in good hands following the appointment of its new CEO Chris Kempczinski, as he has played an integral role alongside the former CEO Easterbrook in driving company performance. AbbVie (ABBV) performed well; the Co. submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for its Imbruvica for treatment of patients younger than 70 years old with small or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Separately, the Co. will price USD 28bln in supply next week for its Allergan (AGN) acquisition. Alibaba (BABA) made decent strides on reports that it is planning to launch its Hong Kong IPO in the last week of November, according to sources; the Co. hopes to raise USD 15bln in its offering. HP (HPQ) was under pressure on reports that its board is not convinced that a sale to Xerox (XRX) is the right move. DuPont de Nemours Inc (DD) moved lower in choppy trade, on reports that it is considering divesting is transportation business. Albemarle (ALB) was under pressure after being downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan, who noted the growth rate for global electric vehicles is slowing whilst lithium supply is picking up, leading its analysts to believe the Co.’s long term contracts are potentially to be renegotiated downwards. Elsewhere in notable downgrades, Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF) was pressured on a downgrade to hold from buy at Jefferies, citing limited scope for a third-party acquisition bid, although LVMH (MC FP) is reportedly willing to up its offer from USD 120/share. United Rentals (URI) performed well after being upgraded to Conviction buy at Goldman Sachs, while Cummins (CMI) was supported by an upgrade at Evercore ISI. Boeing (BA) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) saw pressure as it was announced LUV would be pushing back the flight schedule for BA’s 737 Max jet to March; from February previously. LUV also announced due to the delay it is unable to provide Q120 ASM guidance at this time. AstraZeneca (AZN) caught a bid during trade as its phase 3 Farxiga trial met its primary efficacy endpoint. Also of note, unconfirmed source reports noted takeover chatter for PayPal (PYPL), with Mastercard (MA) touted as a potential suitor with a USD 135/shr offer. S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3093, NASDAQ-100 0.4% at 8256, Dow Jones 0% at 27681.</p><p>A lack of conviction in risk appetite was evident in the TPLEX which settled little changed. The T-Note was offered through the European session before reversing course in the latter end of the day, triggered by US President Trump saying he had not yet decided whether to roll back China tariffs. More broadly, looking at the week, the TPLEX has seen significant amount of selling, with yields at levels not seen since July, off their lows in late-August/early-September. Given the reported progress in US-China trade, Treasury refunding, ramped up corporate issuance and a Fed now (presumably) on pause, the selling pressure on the TPLEX is of little surprise in this first week of November. T-note futures (Z9) settled unchanged at 128-12+.</p>",
