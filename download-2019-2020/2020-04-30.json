Strategy-wise in the US, in April, small caps (RUT) have been among the top performers, with high dividend names also putting in a decent performance; minimum volatility and value strategies have lagged, although they are both still up around 10% in April (lagging ES which is up around 12% this month, while NQ is up around 15% in the month); some desks are now looking at stocks that have showed “positive linearity” (i.e. have given updates indicating that they have bounced back from the worst of COVID, or are seeing stability). The ECB meeting passed without much drama, with the central bank reiterating commitments to support the economy. On the data slate, weekly claims edged lower for a fourth straight week, while personal income and spending data showed the consumer under pressure in March (as expected, really). In aggregate, there hasn’t been much that has shifted the macro dial, and some profit-taking was cited, although major indices are still up a healthy amount this week. US FDA chief announced it is moving at “lightning speed” on Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir experimental COVID-19 treatment. Intel (INTC) has reportedly launched its S-Series family of microprocessors targeted at gaming machines, increasing competition with AMD (AMD), according to Venture Beat. Boeing (BA) was cut from BBB to BBB-/stable at S&amp;P. Meanwhile, BA is expected to launch a 7-tranche USD bond today. Exxon Mobil (XOM) maintained its quarterly dividend at USD 0.87/shr – its European peer Shell (RDSA LN) caught much attention today after announcing it would cut its dividend, the first oil major to do so. Disney (DIS) announced it is to move its “The Rise of the Skywalker” and “Artemis Fowl” to its Disney+ streaming service sooner than initially planned, according to WSJ. Zoom Video (ZM) admitted it does not have 300mln daily users; the same day it replaces Willis Tower Watson (WLTW) in the Nasdaq-100 index. SPX -0.9% at 2912, NDX +0.2% at 9001, DJIA -1.2% at 24,331.</p><p>A choppy session for the TPLEX, which had initially gotten off on the front-foot amid receding risk appetite, before reversing course into the settlement as IG corporate supply flooded. Disappointing GDP figures out of Europe, although expected, alongside month-end flows (read below) supported Treasuries heading into the US session. Another round of dire US data left the door open to inflows, and ECB’s Lagarde alluding to further stimulus to come. However, selling pressure began in the latter part of the session, in a steepening fashion. The selling pressure was likely a function of both month-end flows and corporate supply, where around ten IG issuers came to the dollar market as corporates emerge from the other side of earnings. Most notably, Boeing, who launched USD 25bln across seven tranches (3s, 5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) with orders books reportedly reaching above USD 75bln for the - on average - T+450bps issue. IFR noted that April set a monthly IG issuance record of USD 288bln. By settlement, on the Treasury curve, 2s unch at 20bps, 10s unch at 63bps, 30s +3bps at 1.27%. Note that LIBOR continued to fall with the 3-month down by 13bps although nearby Eurodollars didn’t budge again today. US T-note futures (M0) settled 3 ticks higher at 139-02.</p>",

However, by around the cash open, gains had been surrendered. A few reasons had been cited: month-end models favour equity selling/bond buying given the stocks rally seen in April; the mood in Europe was mixed at best ahead of the ECB, after oil major Shell cut its dividend, while banks were defensive after earnings from Societe Generale (GLE FP) and BBVA (BBVA&nbsp; SM). Strategy-wise in the US, in April, small caps (RUT) have been among the top performers, with high dividend names also putting in a decent performance; minimum volatility and value strategies have lagged, although they are both still up around 10% in April (lagging ES which is up around 12% this month, while NQ is up around 15% in the month); some desks are now looking at stocks that have showed “positive linearity” (i.e. have given updates indicating that they have bounced back from the worst of COVID, or are seeing stability). The ECB meeting passed without much drama, with the central bank reiterating commitments to support the economy. On the data slate, weekly claims edged lower for a fourth straight week, while personal income and spending data showed the consumer under pressure in March (as expected, really). In aggregate, there hasn’t been much that has shifted the macro dial, and some profit-taking was cited, although major indices are still up a healthy amount this week. Crude was higher ahead of OPEC production cuts starting on May 1st, while book-squaring has also been mentioned ahead of month-end. Elsewhere, Treasury yields and major curve spreads were little changed after a choppy session; the dollar has had a downside bias (month-end models also flagged USD selling), while gold has been finding the air thin above USD 1,700. After market, attention will be on heavy weights AAPL, AMZN, GILD and V.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS</strong></h2><p><strong>GILEAD</strong>: NIH noted preliminary the results indicated patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster recovery time than those with a placebo. The results also showed remdesivir accelerated recovery from advanced COVID-19 and suggested a survival benefit with a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving the drug and 11.6% for those with a placebo, while median recovery time was 11 days for those with it compared to 15 days for those who received a placebo. The FDA Chief said they are moving ahead at lightning speed on the drug. RBC’s biotech analysts note that a rough estimate of Gilead’s target production suggests that there may just be enough to initially comfortably cover the volume represented by eligible patients in the US, assuming no problems, although it is “dependent on many highly variable and unknown factors.”</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>ECB: </strong>The latest policy announcement from the ECB saw policymakers opt to stand pat on rates once again with the general train of thought at the Bank being that delving deeper into negative territory at this stage would provide little in the way of stimulus for the Eurozone. Instead, the Governing Council opted to sweeten the terms of the existing TLTROIII operations and launch a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) with the view of supporting liquidity conditions in the euro area. Those hoping for an expansion of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) were left somewhat disappointed with the current envelope left at a size of EUR 750bln, whilst the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue to run at a monthly pace of EUR 20bln. That said, the Governing Council was explicit in informing market participants that it “is fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed”. Following the policy announcement, Pantheon Macroeconomics stated that their base case is for both the PEPP and QE programmes to be “extended through H1 2021, at least”. At the accompanying press conference, Lagarde provided a relatively cautious introductory statement as expected whilst stopping short of specific forecasts on the macro outlook; staff economic projections are not due until the June meeting. In-fitting with the policy announcement, Lagarde took every opportunity to remind those watching that the Governing Council will be there to help support the Eurozone economy, however policy will need to be carried out in a coordinated manner with fiscal authorities. Heading into the announcement some desk had speculated about the possibility of yield curve control (YCC), on which, Lagarde stated, the combination of tools the ECB is currently using enables it to operate across the entire curve; but noted ECB will use all flexibility that it has. Elsewhere, despite some slightly incoherent responses during the Q&amp;A segment (in a bid to avoid any faux paus such as that seen in March), the press conference wasn’t too much of a game-changer for the narrative surrounding the Bank’s current course of action. In terms of what lies, ahead, Lagarde stated that so far there has been no discussion on purchasing junk bonds under APP and currently there has been no discussions on extending the PELTROs to non-banks, however, she again reiterated the ECB’s flexibility. Overall, Lagarde successfully managed to stick to the script that the Bank will utilise all of the tools at its disposal to help navigate the Eurozone economy through this crisis and avoid fragmentation. However, as opined by ING “in the current situation and in the next phase when the eurozone economy enters the recovery, the ECB will not be in the driver’s seat, fiscal policy will have to do the heavy work”.</p><p><strong>FED: </strong>The Main Street Lening programme was expanded, as expected, today. The Fed is creating a third loan option with more risk sharing by lenders, lowering minimum loan size to USD 500k from USD 1mln, expanding scope and eligibility for the programme. To include businesses with up to 15k employees vs prev. 10k, and up to USD 5bln in annual revenue vs prev. USD 2.5bln. Under the new options, lenders would retain a 15% share on loans for borrowers requiring greater leverage. Fed is also expanding the pool of eligible businesses and said the start date is to be announced soon. One detail it mentioned was that the loans will be now based off of LIBOR, instead of the originally planned SOFR, as borrowers/banks said they were not prepared to use the proposed LIBOR replacement benchmark rate; this marks another blow to the transition to the SOFR rate.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINA: </strong>Overnight US President Trump noted the US is looking at different options regarding consequences for China for its handling of coronavirus crisis in which he suggested he could do a lot. This was later followed by a WaPo report suggesting the measures which are being considered are 1) asking for monetary damages, 2) stripping China of sovereign immunity, allowing it to be sued, 3) consider US cancelling part of its debt obligations to China. However, NEC Director Kudlow heavily rebuffed the third option saying it is “absolutely and unequivocally untrue”. The disputes between the US and China have been ongoing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with some nervous to whether a deuteriation in the relationship between the two could happen post COVID and thus impact trade. Note today traders reported that Chinese importers purchased 300k tonnes of Soybeans while Archer Daniel Midland (ADM) believes China will be increasing purchases of US agricultural goods as the year progresses and suggests as China moves towards honouring the USD 36bln of purchases, it is possible ethanol will enter the picture, particularly in Q4.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 2.73 HIGHER AT USD 21.85; BRENT (M0) EXPIRED USD 2.73 HIGHER AT USD 25.27/BBL, BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 2.25 HIGHER AT USD 26.48/BBL.</strong></p><p>Crude prices extended their solid gains on Thursday, despite wider risk aversion. Again, the market appears to be clawing back its losses, which were led by front-month WTI futures as participants baulked at taking delivery amid tight storage – a problem that is yet to be resolved. Perhaps the market is finding solace in comments from US Treasury Secretary Mncuhin, who late Wednesday said that the White House was looking at the ability to store another several hundred million barrels of oil. On a similar note, nine companies including, CVX and XOM (who both report earnings tomorrow), have agreed to rent space to store 23mln barrels of crude in the SPR. Furthermore, last night Norway’s Oil Ministry said it would be cutting output; cutting by 250k BOE/D in June and 134k in H2; additionally, the start-up of production at several fields will be delayed until 2021. Norway said that consequentially, production in December 2020 will be 300k BPD less than originally planned, although the regulation would cease by the year-end. The productive comments were countered by the Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Christian, who said there is still opposition to mandated oil production cuts, noting instead that state producers are already cutting output and that a 20% reduction in Texas will not impact global oil supplies. There were little new updates on the supply front on Thursday, although IEA’s Birol warned that global oil storage could be full by mid-June, calling on OPEC+ countries to consider further cuts. Note also that June Brent futures expire today, so there could be an element of book squaring in today’s tape action.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-02.</strong></p><p>A choppy session for the TPLEX, which had initially gotten off on the front-foot amid receding risk appetite, before reversing course into the settlement as IG corporate supply flooded. Disappointing GDP figures out of Europe, although expected, alongside month-end flows (read below) supported Treasuries heading into the US session. Another round of dire US data left the door open to inflows, and ECB’s Lagarde alluding to further stimulus to come. However, selling pressure began in the latter part of the session, in a steepening fashion. The selling pressure was likely a function of both month-end flows and corporate supply, where around ten IG issuers came to the dollar market as corporates emerge from the other side of earnings. Most notably, Boeing, who launched USD 25bln across seven tranches (3s, 5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) with orders books reportedly reaching above USD 75bln for the - on average - T+450bps issue. IFR noted that April set a monthly IG issuance record of USD 288bln. By settlement, on the Treasury curve, 2s unch at 20bps, 10s unch at 63bps, 30s +3bps at 1.27%. Note that LIBOR continued to fall with the 3-month down by 13bps although nearby Eurodollars didn’t budge again today.</p><p><strong>MONTH-END:</strong> UBS notes large Treasury extension (0.14yrs) for the end-April rebalancing. UBS says this is higher than its 3-year end-April average (0.07yrs) and historical 3-month, 6-month, 12-month averages. “It is worth noting that this unusual large extension is a result of temporary change in the rebalancing rule last month and hence incomparable to historical extension.” The bank also estimates that month-end pension rebalancing could see USD 75-115bln equities sold, and reinvested into bonds, UBS says. Model predicts USD 90-140bln of US equity selling, versus USD 15-25bln of international equity buying.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.9% at 2912, NDX +0.2% at 9001, DJIA -1.2% at 24,331.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary +0.4%, Information Technology -0.45%, Real Estate -0.7%, Consumer Staples -1.1%, Industrials -2%, Energy -2.2%, Utilities -2.4%, Communications Svs -2.4%, Financials -2.7%, Materials -3%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The US FDA chief announced it is moving at “lightning speed” on Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir experimental COVID-19 treatment. Intel (INTC) has reportedly launched its S-Series family of microprocessors targeted at gaming machines, increasing competition with AMD (AMD), according to Venture Beat. Boeing (BA) was cut from BBB to BBB-/stable at S&amp;P. Meanwhile, BA is expected to launch a 7-tranche USD bond today. Exxon Mobil (XOM) maintained its quarterly dividend at USD 0.87/shr – its European peer Shell (RDSA LN) caught much attention today after announcing it would cut its dividend, the first oil major to do so. Disney (DIS) announced it is to move its “The Rise of the Skywalker” and “Artemis Fowl” to its Disney+ streaming service sooner than initially planned, according to WSJ. Zoom Video (ZM) admitted it does not have 300mln daily users; the same day it replaces Willis Tower Watson (WLTW) in the Nasdaq-100 index.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Microsoft (MSFT) beat on EPS and revenue. Its breakdown of revenues was also solid with its Azure revenue growth at 39%, supporting the cloud server revenues. McDonald’s (MCD missed on EPS, although beat on revenue, while SSS declined amid mass closures, it did note it began the year with exceptionally strong momentum. Tesla (TSLA) beat on EPS and revenue was in line. TSLA expects Model 3 production to reach 4k a week by the middle of the year while remaining committed to its Model Y expansion. Qualcomm (QCOM) beat on top and bottom line although MSM chip shipments fell 17% Y/Y to 129mln. Q3 EPS guidance was firmer than expected. Facebook (FB) rallied after a beat on advertising revenue while DAU’s and MAU’s surged amid COVID-19, beating expectations. FB also noted it has seen some signs of stabilisation. Twitter (TWTR) missed on EPS and printed an unexpected loss per share while its advertising revenue and DAU’s were more or less in line with expectations.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> US weekly initial jobless claims lower for the fourth straight week; it may be mid-June before claims fall beneath 1mln, Pantheon Macroeconomics says. Weekly initial jobless claims data for the w/e April 25th saw the headline at 3.84mln, topping the consensus 3.5mlnl continuing claims, however, came in lower than expected at 17.99mln - the Street was looking for 19.24mln. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the data is still terrible, but a little bit less terrible than last week. “Claims have now fallen by 3.0M from the peak, in the week ended March 28thth, but the 588K drop this week is the smallest in three weeks, and the weekly level is still nearly six times higher than in the worst single week after the crash of 2008.” The consultancy says its proxies imply claims will fall again next week, to around 3.1mln. Pantheon believes that layoffs are now working through supply chains and services firms, away from the front-line consumer-facing businesses which laid off so many people when the lockdowns began. “We reckon claims will dip below 1mln by mid-June, with a total increase of 11mln-to-12mln between the April and May payroll survey weeks.” NOTE: This week’s data will not factor into the BLS employment situation report for April, released May 8th - last week’s claims data served coincided with the survey period.</p><p><strong>US CONSUMER SPENDING:</strong> US consumer spending froze in March; April likely to be even worse, Oxford Economics says. Consumer spending fell by the largest monthly amount on record (personal consumption -7.5% M/M against an expected -5.0%; personal income -2.0% M/M against an expected -1.5%). “The combination of massive layoffs, reduced hours worked, curbed salaries and financial turmoil led to a steep 2.0% decline in disposable income – the largest since 2013 – which was only partially offset by greater benefit payments,” Oxford Economics says. Consumers were building their savings (the savings rate to the highest since 1975 at 13.1%, from 8.2%). The PCE data was more stable, with the core M/M falling 0.1% in line with the consensus, while the Y/Y core rate rose 0.1ppts to 1.7%; in the coming months, OxEco expects the strong disinflationary impulse from the virus fallout to lead to deflation for headline PCE and the weakest core PCE inflation on record. “The coronavirus fear, the social distancing measures, the financial volatility and plummeting confidence have taken a severe toll on consumers’ ability and willingness to spend,” the consultancy writes, “we estimate household outlays will likely contract around 15% in Q2, or nearly 50% annualised, with services outlays down nearly 20%, or roughly 60% annualised.”</p><p><strong>CHICAGO PMI:</strong> In April headline PMI declined to 35.4 to its lowest level since March 2009 spurred by a drop in Business confidence, the report notes. Production fell 19 points to the lowest level since June 1980 while New Orders saw the steepst decline on record after COVID-19 hits both demand and production. Employment fell to 11.1 point, lowest since June 2009 while prices dipped beneath 50 after a 14.6-point decline to the lowest level since March 2016. Elsewhere, the report notes inventories rose for a 9th consecutive month but remains beneath the 50.0 mark.</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>Month-end sees dollar sell off support the EURO</strong></p><p><strong>USD: </strong>The greenback tumbled on Thursday with many month-end rebalancing models pointing towards dollar selling. The DXY crossed beneath 99 at one point before gradually paring back slightly from the extremes.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> With the ECB somewhat disappointing (some investors had hoped for an expansion of the PEPP and/or APP, although it did introduce “PELTRO” and eased the measures on its LTRO III programme). The single currency firmed over the course of the session, despite Bund/BTP spreads widening. However, despite the aforementioned factors, the month-end dollar selling clearly dominated price action, and helped support the single currency to highs of 1.0971.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP, CAD):</strong> Cyclicals were mixed: the AUD succumbed to downbeat risk sentiment, as major equity indices fell. Even with USD selling heavily, the Aussie failed to reap the same benefits as others, particularly GBP which rallied heading into the London fix. CAD also saw weakness, though USDCAD remains sub-1.40 as oil prices ticked up. Kiwi seemed to benefit from the USD selling pressures.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (RUB, NOK):</strong> WTI and Brent continued to rebound on Thursday, supported by the reports from Norway that it is cut oil output, and US policymakers hinting at support for the energy sector. Despite oil upside, the RUB weakened, underperforming the EMFX complex, perhaps as a result of its PM being diagnosed with the coronavirus. ING noted that the RUB looks the most attractive among commodity exporters due to its relatively solid fiscal position. NOK traded flat against the Euro today, with ING’s strategists suggesting that upside will be limited and EURNOK should remain above 11.00.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong>&nbsp; EMFX couldn’t stage a rally, despite the USD weakness, as other risk benchmarks were struggling. ZAR saw weakness after South Africa was downgraded deeper into Junk by S&amp;P, which cited the impact of COVID-19.&nbsp; TRY was also weaker, although not to the same extent as other EMFX; the CBRT noted that it is in discussions with other central banks about swap lines, and it cut its year end inflation forecast to 7.4% from 8.2%.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>A choppy session for the TPLEX, which had originally gotten off on the front-foot amid receding risk appetite, before reversing course into the settlement as IG corporate supply flooded. Disappointing GDP figures out of Europe, although expected, alongside month-end flows (read below) supported Treasuries heading into the US session. Another round of dire US data left the door open to inflows, and ECB’s Lagarde alluding to further stimulus to come. However, selling pressure began in the latter part of the session, in a steepening fashion. The selling pressure was likely a function of both month-end flows and corporate supply, where around ten IG issuers came to the dollar market as corporates emerge from the other side of earnings. Most notably, Boeing, who launched USD 25bln across seven tranches (3s, 5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) with orders books reportedly reaching above USD 75bln for the - on average - T+450bps issue. IFR noted that April set a monthly IG issuance record of USD 288bln. By settlement, on the Treasury curve, 2s unch at 20bps, 10s unch at 63bps, 30s +3bps at 1.27%. Note that LIBOR continued to fall with the 3-month down by 13bps although nearby Eurodollars didn’t budge again today.</li><li><strong>MONTH-END:</strong> UBS notes large Treasury extension (0.14yrs) for the end-April rebalancing. UBS says this is higher than its 3-year end-April average (0.07yrs) and historical 3-month, 6-month, 12-month averages. “It is worth noting that this unusual large extension is a result of temporary change in the rebalancing rule last month and hence incomparable to historical extension.” The bank also estimates that month-end pension rebalancing could see USD 75-115bln equities sold, and reinvested into bonds, UBS says. Model predicts USD 90-140bln of US equity selling, versus USD 15-25bln of international equity buying</li></ul>",

The DXY crossed beneath 99 at one point before gradually paring back slightly from the extremes.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>With the ECB somewhat disappointing (some investors had hoped for an expansion of the PEPP and/or APP, although it did introduce “PELTRO” and eased the measures on its LTRO III programme). The single currency firmed over the course of the session, despite Bund/BTP spreads widening. However, despite the aforementioned factors, the month-end dollar selling clearly dominated price action, and helped support the single currency to highs of 1.0971.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP, CAD): </strong>Cyclicals were mixed: the AUD succumbed to downbeat risk sentiment, as major equity indices fell. Even with USD selling heavily, the Aussie failed to reap the same benefits as others, particularly GBP which rallied heading into the London fix. CAD also saw weakness, though USDCAD remains sub-1.40 as oil prices ticked up. Kiwi seemed to benefit from the USD selling pressures.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (RUB, NOK):</strong> WTI and Brent continued to rebound on Thursday, supported by the reports from Norway that it is cut oil output, and US policymakers hinting at support for the energy sector. Despite oil upside, the RUB weakened, underperforming the EMFX complex, perhaps as a result of its PM being diagnosed with the coronavirus. ING noted that the RUB looks the most attractive among commodity exporters due to its relatively solid fiscal position. NOK traded flat against the Euro today, with ING’s strategists suggesting that upside will be limited and EURNOK should remain above 11.00.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong>&nbsp; EMFX couldn’t stage a rally, despite the USD weakness, as other risk benchmarks were struggling. ZAR saw weakness after South Africa was downgraded deeper into Junk by S&amp;P, which cited the impact of COVID-19.&nbsp; TRY was also weaker, although not to the same extent as other EMFX; the CBRT noted that it is in discussions with other central banks about swap lines, and it cut its year end inflation forecast to 7.4% from 8.2%.</p>",

Again, the market appears to be clawing back its losses, which were led by front-month WTI futures as participants baulked at taking delivery amid tight storage – a problem that is yet to be resolved. Perhaps the market is finding solace in comments from US Treasury Secretary Mncuhin, who late Wednesday said that the White House was looking at the ability to store another several hundred million barrels of oil. On a similar note, nine companies including, CVX and XOM (who both report earnings tomorrow), have agreed to rent space to store 23mln barrels of crude in the SPR. Furthermore, last night Norway’s Oil Ministry said it would be cutting output; cutting by 250k BOE/D in June and 134k in H2; additionally, the start-up of production at several fields will be delayed until 2021. Norway said that consequentially, production in December 2020 will be 300k BPD less than originally planned, although the regulation would cease by the year-end. The productive comments were countered by the Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Christian, who said there is still opposition to mandated oil production cuts, noting instead that state producers are already cutting output and that a 20% reduction in Texas will not impact global oil supplies. There were little new updates on the supply front on Thursday, although IEA’s Birol warned that global oil storage could be full by mid-June, calling on OPEC+ countries to consider further cuts. Note also that June Brent futures expire today, so there could be an element of book squaring in today’s tape action.</li></ul>",

However, the Buck clawed back losses vs riskier and high beta currencies as the mood soured amidst final month asset rebalancing in favour of bonds over stocks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Aside from knee-jerks during ECB President Lagarde’s post-policy meeting press conference that highlighted unprecedented economic contraction caused by COVID-19 and pronounced downside for inflation as a result, the Euro was also remarkably resolute and rebounded firmly from around 1.0834 vs Greenback to eclipse last week’s peak just under 1.0900 on the way through 1.0950. To recap, the ECB sweetened its TLTRO3 terms via lower rates and added new liquidity repos in the form of PELTROs, but left all benchmark rates unchanged along with the QE envelope and PEPP, albeit with the usual pledge to offer more stimulus if needed.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/NZD</strong></p><p>The Pound was clear beneficiary of bullish seasonal factors allied to the aforementioned month end Dollar flogging, as Cable flew beyond 1.2500 and then 1.2600, while Eur/Gbp reversed further from recent peaks over the 200 DMA to sub-0.8700 again. Similarly, the Franc made significant gains at the expense of its US rival and roared back from circa 0.9760 to 0.9640, while the Kiwi regrouped on the 0.6100 handle and unwound declines relative to its Aussie neighbour after Aud/Nzd failed to reach 1.0700 and Aud/Usd ran into option-related offers at 0.6570 (2.7 bn expired today) that thwarted a breach of the 100 DMA (0.6567).</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Loonie posted a new mtd best vs its US counterpart with the aid of an extended bounce in crude, but was undermined by Canadian data (GDP and retail sales) and retraced from 1.3850 to 1.3912 at worst, while the Yen appears to have paid the price for not sustaining momentum through a key Fib retracement level as Usd/Jpy spiked from 106.42 to 107.20 before paring back.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Choppy trade across the board, but the Sek and Nok are retaining upward trajectories vs the Eur following another, albeit minor rise in Norges Bank daily purchases of the Krona vs foreign currencies starting from tomorrow and until the end of May. Conversely, most EMs are depreciating, with the Try not helped by the CBRT lowering its inflation forecast for the end of 2020 and Zar ultimately under pressure after S&amp;P cut SA’s rating further below junk.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO SNAPSHOT:</strong> Asia traded with a positive tone, despite soft PMI data out of China (non-mfg PMI up; mfg PMI down, and new export orders were grim); but Europe is lower across the region; banking names were hit after the ECB and soft trading updates from Societe Generale, and BBVA earnings underwhelmed. US equity index futures were initially firmer, although have now entered negative territory in line with Europe post ECB, with Nasdaq-100 still just in the green after decent updates from big tech in the last couple of days. Treasury yields are lower, with most of the action in the belly, while major curve spreads are mixed. The USD and gold are roughly flat. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>The majority of sectors open in negative territory, with losses led by Financials amid lower yields across the curve. Materials are also lagging, with Dow (DOW) weighing after poor earnings. Communication Services are outperforming being propped by gains in Facebook (FB) following a solid earnings report released Wednesday AMC. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The US FDA chief announced it is moving at “lighting speed” on Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir experimental COVID-19 treatment. Intel (INTC) has reportedly launched its S-Series family of microprocessors targeted at gaming machines, increasing competition with AMD (AMD), according to Venture Beat. Boeing (BA) was cut from BBB to BBB-/stable at S&amp;P. Meanwhile, the BA is expected to launch a 7-tranche USD bond today. Exxon Mobil (XOM) maintained its quarterly dividend at USD 0.87/shr – it’s European peer Shell (RDSA LN) caught much attention today after announcing it would cut its dividend, the first oil major to do so. Disney (DIS) announced it is to move its “The Rise of the Skywalker” and “Artemis Fowl” to its Disney+ streaming service sooner than initially planned, according to WSJ. Zoom Video (ZM) admitted it does not have 300mln daily users. &nbsp;EARNINGS: Microsoft (MSFT) beat on EPS and revenue. Its breakdown of revenues was also solid with its Azure revenue growth at 39%, supporting the cloud server revenues. McDonalds (MCD missed on EPS, although beat on revenue, while SSS declined amid mass closures, it did note it began the year with exceptionally strong momentum. Tesla (TSLA) beat on EPS and revenue was in line. TSLA expects Model 3 production to reach 4k a week by the middle of the year while remaining committed to its Model Y expansion. Qualcomm (QCOM) beat on top and bottom line although MSM chip shipments fell 17% Y/Y to 129mln. Q3 EPS guidance was firmer than expected. Facebook (FB) rallied after a beat on advertising revenue while DAU’s and MAU’s surged amid COVID-19, beating expectations. FB also noted it has seen some signs of stabilization.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WATCH THE ENERGY SECTOR:</strong> Energy is also in focus after Norway officially said it would cut output late Wednesday. After hours, XOM also said it would be maintaining its dividend, although its European peer Shell (RDSA LN) this morning became the first oil major to cut its dividend in the COVID-19 fallout, and is seeing downside in European trade. Also, US President Trump announced that a plan to help oil companies was coming shortly. Additionally, nine companies including CVX and XOM have agreed to rent space to store 23mln barrels of crude in the SPR, Reuters reported. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPM EARNINGS TRACKER: </strong>JPMorgan’s earnings season tracker points to negative surprises in the US of -2%, despite consensus expectations which looked for double-digit EPS falls at the beginning of the quarter. “In contrast to past quarters, where the earnings integer would inflect higher once the reporting started, blended Q1 '20e EPS growth for S&amp;P500 continues to move lower, currently at $32, down from $40 at the start of the year” the bank writes. JPM notes that nominally in the US, 65% of S&amp;P 500 companies beat EPS estimates, but this ratio is the lowest in at least a decade; EPS growth is around -16% Y/Y which is about 2% below consensus. The bank observes that earnings delivery for Financials is very weak, down nearly 50% Y/Y, but ex-Financials EPS growth in the S&amp;P 500 is flat this quarter Y/Y. Meanwhile, Cyclicals are also printing negative growth, while Defensives have fared better. Revenue growth is flat, with 66% of companies beating estimates. Aftermarket, earnings from AAPL (preview here), AMZN (preview here), and V (preview here) are eyed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;LINEARITY/STYLES:</strong> Some desks note that, stylistically, companies that have reported positive “linearity” (i.e. have shown early signs of bouncing back from pandemic – like GOOG and FB, who both reported advertising trends had improved after the initial downside) are likely to be rewarded, even if the incoming metrics are still on the soft side. US equities saw a pro-cyclical twist on Tuesday, with investors selling momentum and growth, although the big tech earnings in the last couple of days may help stabilise that trend. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

US equity index futures were firmer, although have now begun edging into the red, with Nasdaq-100 still just in the green after decent updates from big tech in the last couple of days. Treasury yields are lower, with most of the action in the belly, while major curve spreads are mixed. The USD and gold are roughly flat.</li><li><strong>US STOCKS:</strong>&nbsp;Nasdaq-100 futures are outperforming in the pre-market, following a decent reporting slate aftermarket on Wednesday, which had a tech-heavy feel: positive update from MSFT (cloud supporting during the pandemic), FB (saw stability in advertising trends in April after weak March – similar to what GOOG said this week); QCOM (China smartphone demand is almost fully restored), while TSLA (made money in Q1),and EBAY (also benefiting from pandemic). In energy, last night XOM maintained its dividend (European peer, Shell, cut its this morning).</li><li><strong>WATCH THE ENERGY SECTOR:</strong>&nbsp;Energy is also in focus after Norway officially said it would cut output late Wednesday. After hours, XOM also said it would be maintaining its dividend, although its European peer Shell (RDSA LN) this morning became the first oil major to cut its dividend in the COVID-19 fallout, and is seeing downside in European trade. Also, US President Trump announced that a plan to help oil companies was coming shortly. Additionally, nine companies including CVX and XOM have agreed to rent space to store 23mln barrels of crude in the SPR, Reuters reported.</li><li><strong>JPM EARNINGS TRACKER:</strong>&nbsp;JPMorgan’s earnings season tracker points to negative surprises in the US of -2%, despite consensus expectations which looked for double-digit EPS falls at the beginning of the quarter. “In contrast to past quarters, where the earnings integer would inflect higher once the reporting started, blended Q1 '20e EPS growth for S&amp;P500 continues to move lower, currently at $32, down from $40 at the start of the year” the bank writes. JPM notes that nominally in the US, 65% of S&amp;P 500 companies beat EPS estimates, but this ratio is the lowest in at least a decade; EPS growth is around -16% Y/Y which is about 2% below consensus. The bank observes that earnings delivery for Financials is very weak, down nearly 50% Y/Y, but ex-Financials EPS growth in the S&amp;P 500 is flat this quarter Y/Y. Meanwhile, Cyclicals are also printing negative growth, while Defensives have fared better. Revenue growth is flat, with 66% of companies beating estimates.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is holding up relatively well in wake of the FOMC and presser from Fed Chair Powell that was forthright in terms of appraising the sever economic impact of the coronavirus containment efforts and the high probability that even more stimulus will be required, monetary and fiscal, to try and ensure a robust post-pandemic recovery. Moreover, the Greenback remains prone to further month-end outflows for rebalancing purposes and erosion of safe-haven premium given buoyant risk sentiment based on hopes for an anti-COVID-19 treatment and/or vaccine. However, the DXY is managing to stay within proximity of the 99.500 level that has been pivotal within recent ranges and is still keeping the index resistant on approach towards 99.000</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>The major “outperformers”, albeit amidst quite restrained parameters overall, as the Franc inches closer to 0.9700 and further away from 1.0600 vs. the Euro, while Cable rebounds towards 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp recoils towards 0.8700 on a mix of month end demand and technical factors. Note, one bank model is pointing to outsize Sterling demand vs. the Buck and especially from 1500BST to 1600BST when fund managers re-hedge stock portfolios, while the cross is back below the 200DMA again.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>Another upturn in oil prices has helped the Loonie consolidate gains above 1.3900 and almost match the current mtd peak not far from 1.3850 ahead of Canadian data comprising monthly GDP and PPI, while the Euro is still meeting resistance ahead of 1.0900 and last week’s apex just shy of the round number, though also finding underlying bids on dips despite more downbeat Eurozone data in the run-up to ECB</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The Yen also looks locked between decent option expiries and a key chart level that was marginally breached on Wednesday, while many Japanese participants were otherwise engaged given a market holiday on the penultimate trading session of April, but did not trigger stops to test 106.00. Subsequently, Usd/Jpy is meandering between 106.87-42 and back above the aforementioned technical mark (50% Fib retracement at 106.45)</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Aud lost impetus around 100 DMA at 0.6567, and mega 2.7 bn expiry at 0.6570.

        "content": "<p>Another blank UK agenda and no further clarity about the timing of any re-opening or relaxation of coronavirus restrictions has left UK debt and STIR futures rather indifferent and lacklustre at the start of the last session of the month. 3 month contracts have been mostly on the defensive since the Liffe open and -2 ticks to just +0.5 tick vs Wednesday’s settlement levels, while the 10 year bond lags peers between 137.20-136.95 parameters compared to its 137.10 prior close. Perhaps debt futures are still taking on board the scale of DMO supply in store over the next 3 months and acknowledging the tapered issuance calendar, but if April’s auctions are a reliable guide then there seems little to fear in terms of demand. From a technical standpoint, nearest resistance remains at 137.45 (last Friday’s high), with support further below 137.00 at 136.74 (this Monday’s low).</p>",

The announcements, akin to prior Remsidivir updates, saw equity bourses rally, although discussion revolves around whether the optimism is premature. Firstly, the severe patients study success will only be constructive if the drug passes on a safety and efficacy basis – something which the government (NIAID) study should provide some insight on, although as of yet, it is not quite clear if the study is testing for both bases. If the government study proves that the drug fails on safety/efficacy, then the difference between 5-day and 10-day treatment will be meaningless, but on the contrary, if the drug passes, then today’s results would mean greater supply available as patients would require less of the treatment, hence optimising its availability. Sceptics also draw attention to the fact that the Gilead trial results announced today had a 9% fatality rate, or 39 deaths, which appears only a moderate improvement to the natural death rate from the virus, although the sample size is small and thus drawing conclusions in general from the results are difficult. Instead, the wider government study to be released tonight should provide a greater understanding, and optimist on the drug allude to the fact that White House officials, including President Trump, have pre-announced that the results will be released and drawn attention to the study – see Fauci comments below – which could be indicative of success in the trial.</li><li><strong>NIH DIRECTOR FAUCI</strong> said preliminary Remdesivir results indicate patients who received the drug had a 31% faster recovery time than those with a placebo (note that the statistical significance of such claims remain cloudy). Fauci said it showed Remdesivir accelerated recovery from advanced COVID-19 cases. The preliminary results suggested a survival benefit with a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving Remdesivir vs 11.6% for those with a placebo. Median recovery times was 11 days for those with Remdesivir, compared to 15 days for those who received a placebo, Fauci said.</li></ul>",

Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) was also positive ahead of the extended 5-day weekend in the mainland for Labor Day holidays and amid several blue chip earnings, although gains were somewhat capped by the absence of Hong Kong participants and following mixed Chinese PMI data in which official Manufacturing and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell short of estimates but Non-Manufacturing and Composite PMIs both improved.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The T-PLEX had a choppy session, albeit tight ranges, after ultimately reversing earlier gains following the FOMC rate decision, which lacked some details that had been sought after. While equities had made solid gains post the remdesivir announcements, The T-Note’s kneejerk losses were quickly reversed in anticipation of the FOMC, where there had been some expectation of some sort of yield curve control as well as forward guidance. However, upon the release of the statement, no such details were specified, and duration was offered. Although as the Fed Chair Powell press conference got underway, the initial rate backup was pared, perhaps as participants digested the lack of limits to the Fed’s asset purchases, and as Powell stressed the Fed would still be needed to do more – one could cherry-pick several comments for the renewed Treasury strength. By settlement, yields were mixed, although major curve spreads were steeper, with the 10-year yield gravitating around the 62bps area.

        "analysis_details": "<p>Asia equity markets trade positive as the region takes impetus from the gains on Wall St where sentiment was underpinned by coronavirus treatment hopes after preliminary results from Gilead’s Remdesivir drug trial showed a 31% faster recovery time and lower mortality rate compared to patients that were given a placebo. Furthermore, the Fed reiterated to keep supporting the economy as necessary and encouraging earnings from several tech heavyweights after-market briefly added fuel to the momentum for US index futures. ASX 200 (+1.7%) is lifted by strength in the energy sector as oil prices continue to make up ground and with a slew of corporate updates in focus including Fortescue Metals which reported higher shipments and maintained its dividend policy at a pay-out ratio between 50%-80% of FY net profit after tax. However, not all were jubilant with big 4 lender ANZ Bank subdued after a 60% decline in H1 cash profit cont. ops and with Woolworths suffering despite higher sales as the retailer also noted the last 4 months have been one of the most challenging periods in its history. Nikkei 225 (+2.5%) outperforms as it plays catch up on return from the holiday closure and as a weaker currency provides an uplift in Tokyo sentiment, while Industrial Production and Retail Sales data were not as bad as had been feared despite both printing in contraction territory. Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) is also positive ahead of the extended 5-day weekend in the mainland for Labor Day holidays and amid several blue chip earnings, although gains are somewhat capped by the absence of Hong Kong participants and following mixed Chinese PMI data in which official Manufacturing and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell short of estimates but Non-Manufacturing and Composite PMIs both improved.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is choppy overnight and tested support at the 99.50 level in the aftermath of an unsurprising FOMC in which the Fed kept rates unchanged at 0.00%-0.25% as expected through unanimous decision. The statement noted the Fed will continue asset purchases in amounts needed to support market functioning and policy transmission, while the dollar amount of asset purchases was withdrawn from the statement and Fed Chair Powell also suggested there will be a need for the Fed to do more. The greenback’s transatlantic peers are indecisive with EUR/USD consolidating around its 20DMA of 1.0864 ahead of today’s ECB policy meeting, while GBP/USD marginally pulled back overnight amid reports UK PM Johnson is to dash hopes for the lockdown to be lifted soon and will warn the nation not to expect major changes to restrictions. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was briefly underpinned by the constructive risk tone and antipodeans gave back some of their recent gains not helped by the mixed Chinese PMI data and weak New Zealand Business Surveys.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand subdued by gains in riskier assets and following a similar lacklustre tone in T-notes, while the absence of the BoJ in the market today and resistance ahead of the 153.00 level also ensured the mundane price action.</p>",
