Additionally the news that Boeing is set to restart commercial jets production, following on from similar updates at European manufacturers such as Daimler, Volkswagen and Volvo. Stocks pared back some of the initial enthusiasm; equities that benefited from 'stay at home' underperformed amid talk of global economies re-opening. In terms of the strategies, high dividend shares did well on Friday after lagging for much of the week; momentum strategies have generally performed well this week, although lagged on Friday; value strategies had a decent session, although they are still down on the week. Treasury yields are ultimately up across the curve and came under pressure in later trade when the NY Fed announced it would be slashing its asset purchases next week to an average daily rate of USD 15bln from USD 30bln this week.</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Friday (via state official health departments) against Thursday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>cases rise 4.6% to 661,712 (Prev. +5.1% 632,548); Death toll +6.4% at 33,049 (Prev. revised 31,071)</li><li><strong>NEW YORK</strong> Death toll rises 5.2% to 12,822 (prev. +5.2% at 12,192); hospitalisations fall to 17,316 (prev. 17,735), lowest since April 5th.</li><li><strong>SPAIN: </strong>Cases<strong> </strong>188,068 (Prev. 182,816); death toll at 19,478 (Prev. 19,310)</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>cases rise 2.1% at 172,434 (Prev. +2.3% at 168,941); death toll +5.1% at 22,745 (Prev. +2.7% at 21,645)</li><li><strong>GERMANY:</strong> Cases rose by 3380 to 133830; death toll rose by 299 to 3868, according to the RKI Health Institute</li><li><strong>FRANCE: </strong>Death toll rises to 18,681 (prev. 17,920); hospitalisations falls for a third straight day in a row to 31,190 (prev. 31,305); ICU patients down for 9th consecutive day</li><li><strong>UK </strong>cases rise to 108,692 (prev. 103,093), death toll rises to 14,576 (prev. 13,729); deaths rise by 847 (+6.17%) vs. yesterday's increase of 861 (+6.69%)</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>cases rise to 30,670 (prev. 28,899), death toll rises to 1,250 (prev. 1,048)</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND: </strong>Cases at 27,078 (Prev. 26,732); Death toll 1059 (Prev. 1017)</li></ul><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US State Department report accuses North Korea of cyberattacks to steal and launder money, extort companies and use digital currencies to gain cash for its nuclear weapons program, according to NYT. Elsewhere, 11 Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats made dangerous and harassing action against 6 US naval ships in international waters in the North Arabian Gulf, while US crews took action deemed appropriate to avoid a collision.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>At pixel time, a deal still has not been reached between the Democrats and Republicans on extra funding for the PPP which was completely depleted yesterday.<strong> </strong>Many had hoped, including Congressman Hoyer, that a deal would be reached today, although comment’s yesterday from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin noted that both sides are still far apart.</p><p><strong>REOPENING: </strong>US President Trump last night layout his three-phase plan on how to re-open the economy. Ultimately, the decision is up to state governors once a certain criterion has been met where a two-week downtrend in documented cases and symptoms before lockdowns can be eased. As part of Phase One, restaurants, sports venues, gyms, movie theatres, etc. can reopen, but only if strict social distancing measures are in place. Phase two includes the reopening of Schools and a resumption of non-essential travel while parks and shopping centres will also be open, but gatherings of over 50 people should be avoided. Phase three, employers can return to normal while large public areas are to have limited social distancing rules. Those who are high at risk should continue social distancing in phase three but are allowed to resume as normal. Looking ahead, given US President Trump has given the responsibility to governors, it should end some of the dispute with NY Governor Cuomo, who has agreed on a co-ordinated reopening with neighbour states. At the same time, seven governors in the Midwest have also agreed on a coordinated action plan. In another move of getting back online, Boeing (BA) is reportedly planning to resume production of its commercial jets in Washington State and Philadelphia from Monday; a major part of its operations with facilities including Puget Sound and Renton facilities in Washington.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>Fed’s Bullard (non-voter) stated the Fed can do much more on liquidity if it is necessary, and that the current programmes in play are “standard moves”. Bullard later added that the upcoming FOMC meeting will be a good time to review the impact of programmes so far and he is not expecting much on forward guidance at the meeting as the story is about the virus, and not rates (a view echoed by others, including Powell). He also stated the only thing the Fed can do in its next statement is emphasize that data right now is not meaningful. The dove also noted it is unlikely the Fed would move to purchase equities and he is not sure it would have much impact given the size and liquidity of the US market. Both Bullard and Mester (Voter) noted that moral hazard is not a concern. Fed’s Williams largely reiterated what he said yesterday, noting the economic pain is likely to continue for some time and that he does not see the economy being back at full strength by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>PBOC</strong> China’s Politburo announced it will use tools such as RRR cuts, interest rate cuts and re-lending to keep liquidity appropriately ample, very much a reiteration from other Chinese officials.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>Governor Bailey<strong> </strong>noted that the recent OBR scenario of a 35% fall in UK GDP in Q2 is not implausible. Bailey stated that the MPC will set out its view in May on how much “scarring” the UK economy is facing and that currently, he cannot say how long the BOE will hold onto purchased Gilts for. Elsewhere, Bailey noted that the fiscal response form the UK may help banks with their upcoming stress tests and that global policymakers at the IMF meeting showed a clear commitment to do what is necessary.</p><p><strong>ECB’s Weidmann </strong>noted it is too early to determine whether the current measures will be enough, adding after the crisis the focus must return to lowering debt.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>GE: </strong>According to reports, each virus hit individual is infecting less than one other person which suggests an R0 of <1, which the Interior Ministry had previously suggested it would ease lockdown restrictions if this figure was reached. The Health Minister noted as of today, the outbreak has become measurable again, however, he was cautious about relaxing lockdown measures. Finance Minister Scholz noted the German public Debt-to-GDP ratio will rise towards 75%.</p><p><strong>IT: </strong>The bank of Italy bulletin sees Q1 GDP declining by roughly 5% Q/Q, while the treasury is reportedly considering a seven-year syndication, according to sources. According to o reports in Il Sole, Italy could approve EUR 70bln in spending through a decree to be placed on Monday.Elsewhere its Education Minister noted it is too risky to start reopening schools.</p><p><strong>UK: </strong>Chancellor Sunak extended the furlough scheme by 1 month to the end of June, with the scheme to be reviewed. The decision was to help against the potential massive job losses the UK will face if the furlough scheme was discontinued too early. The UK also set up a coronavirus vaccine task force.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINA DATA: </strong>China GDP declined 9.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis slightly higher than the expected 9.9% decline while Q1 GDP missed expectations printing -6.8% (exp. -6.5%), a record decline. The print was inevitable given the shutdowns and lockdowns amid the coronavirus, SocGen write “Q1 almost certainly marked the bottom in China’s growth, and domestic supply disruptions have largely dissipated”. The desk writes that the recovery in demand has been sluggish and challenges remain while the world heads for a recession. The bank maintains its prior view and expects 2020 GDP at 2.9% for now. Elsewhere, Industrial Output fared much better than expected at -1.1%, compared to estimates of a 7.3% decline, and the pace heavily slowed from the prior months 13.5% fall.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 0.50 LOWER AT USD 25.03/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 0.26 HIGHER AT USD 28.03/BBL</strong></p><p>Energy futures were mixed on Friday, with May WTI feeling the brunt of the pain amid storage capacity concerns, while Brent was firmer, more in line with risk appetite. Many participants are looking past May WTI as open interest and volume moves into the June contract. However, Citi highlights that the weakness is more than a May contract issue, with June WTI also under pressure, as the physical market becomes more and more constrained in the US (note the record builds printed in this week’s EIA US crude stocks report). Furthermore, the latest Genscape flyover of Cushing also indicates more large builds at the major hub. Citi also notes that one account shrugged off the USD 17/bbl WTI handle, suggesting that it would be 25 next week when June becomes the front month, but in the bank’s view, it says the large contango is not a sign of the bottom, rather that of a glut, where a bottom won’t be in until the spreads come in.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>T-NOTE FUTURES (M20) SETTLE 11 TICKS LOWER AT 138-28+</strong></p><p>A choppy session for the Treasury curve; by settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 10s +3bps at 0.64% and 30s +5bps at 1.26bps. An initial Gilead-induced risk bounce, which sequentially faded, only for Treasuries to be offered after the release of the NY Fed’s new (reduced) scheduled of purchases for next week’s asset buys. After the 10-year yield found solace around the 0.60% figure on Thursday, the risk rally in later trade saw it back up to just beneath 0.70%, with the Fed set to by USD 15bln per day next week, down from USD 30bln. The further tapering of the Fed’s purchases saw the curve bear steepen. However, the cuts will be evenly distributed across maturities, which some analysts suggesting that gives credence to the view that the increasingly Fed-lite market could be expressing its view of increased inflation expectations; one strategist at Janney Montgomery noted that in the wake of the Fed’s QE1 and ZIRP announcement in 2008/09, there was a +75bps back up in long-end yields in the face of a deflationary environment, which saw 2s10s widen to around the 100bps area (2s10s currently sits just below 45bps).</p><p><strong>NY FED TREASURY PURCHASES: </strong>Next week’s schedule will be reduced once again to USD 15bln from USD 30bln per day for the next week. <strong>Aggregate purchases by coupon:</strong></p><ul><li>0-2.25 year USD 24bln (prev.

State Street (STT) beat on the top and bottom line. Schlumberger EPS and revenue fell slightly short of expectations, while it cut its dividend by 75% to USD 0.125/shr.</p><p>STOCK SPECIFICS: Gilead (GILD) remdesivir was reported to have made rapid progress in treating severe COVID-19 patients in Chicago, seeing speedy recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, with nearly all in the closely observed clinical trial, were discharged in a week. Gilead later said that anecdotal reports did not provide statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs, which sees a decline of 36% in Q2 iPhone units. Boeing (BA) is planning to resume commercial jet production in Seattle, Washington as early as Monday, providing some support to suppliers, such as Spirit AeroSystems (SPR). Ford Motor (F) looks for a net loss of around USD 2bln for Q1 2020, according to an SEC filing; expects an approximate USD 800mln tax expense in Q1. Moderna Inc. (MRNA) received USD 483mln in federal funding to accelerate its development of a coronavirus vaccine. Uber (UBER) has withdrawn its FY20 guidance while seeing its Q1 revenue to be cut by USD 17-22mln, and Q2 down by USD 60-80mln. Walmart (WMT) announced it is still seeing strong demand in its stores and has made a new commitment to hire 50,000 new associates; 85% of these to be part-time workers. Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B) Charlie Munger stated the economic turmoil will cause Berkshire to shutter some small businesses; doesn't rule out doing something aggressive, according to WSJ. Booking (BKNG) reportedly told its employees to expect lay-offs in the coming weeks after it received a USD 4bln loan, according to FT</p><p>EARNING EXPECTATIONS: Over the next three weeks 80% of S&amp;P500 companies are set to report with expectations changing recently. JP Morgan highlights Q1 S&amp;P 500 EPS growth rate has been revised to -11% Y/Y (-14% from the January high), and FY20 to -9% Y/Y (-21% from the high). The bank believes estimates are likely still too high due to limited corporate guidance, especially when comparing to Europe where revisions have been down 40 to 70%. The desk notes, with the previously mentioned factors, combined with a high dispersion in the consensus, which suggests high uncertainty/poor visibility, it expects “earnings season to be volatile with increasing risk of more companies suspending guidance and cutting shareholder return”. Overall, although the outlook on earnings is challenging, JPM maintains its positive view on US equities due to progress in governments mitigating the COVID-19 spread and large monetary and fiscal packages, and very favourable positioning; “Hedge funds equity beta at around the 10th percentile, CTAs could go long equities at around 2900, and vol-targeting funds should increase equity exposure”. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24310/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for next week’s earnings expectations.</a></p><h2><strong>WEEKLY FOREX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD: </strong>Another roller-coaster ride for risk sentiment and the Dollar that returned from Easter relatively refreshed, but came under renewed pressure when those centres away for a 4 day holiday weekend re-joined the fray. The Buck buckled and DXY fell to 98.813 from circa 99.508 at the start of play before reversing losses and eventually reclaiming 100.000+ status at 100.300 late Thursday. However, the index has subsequently faded after retesting wtd peaks, but falling a fraction short and it remains uncertain whether the Greenback closes out with net gains or DXY even above 99.500 given a raft of data and surveys showing more evidence of the economic toll on the US economy from measures taken to stop the spread of COVID-19. On that note, some promising news as President Trump sets guidelines to reopen states in lockdown and reports that a remedy has resulted in rapid recoveries for patients suffering from severe respiratory and fever symptoms.</p><p><strong>NZD: </strong>The Kiwi has emerged as Friday’s top G10 performer, and from a technical perspective a close above the 200 HMA (0.6030-35) vs its US counterpart could be construed as constructive, but Nzd/Usd is still considerably weaker overall within 0.5923-0.6130 parameters after RNBZ Governor Orr reiterated the possibility of NIRP alongside more QE and direct financing if the nCoV contagion intensifies.</p><p><strong>NOK/AUD/EUR/JPY/CHF: </strong>The next best majors approaching the end of another truncated (EU) week, but with the Norwegian Krona off best levels vs the Euro on a post-OPEC+ downturn in crude prices following huge/record builds in US weekly inventories and significant downgrades in global demand forecasts from the IEA and OPEC itself, adding to the argument that the latest output cut accord will not be sufficient to address the supply overhang (or even glut). Back down under, the Aussie has been hostage to risk-on/off swings with brief relief taken from better than expected jobs data until buyers digested the fact that the reference point was prior to the closure of non-essential businesses and the true condition of the labour market will be seen in the next report. Nevertheless, Chinese trade and IP updates provided some encouragement over GDP and retail sales, with imports unexpectedly rising to offer hope for the Aud and keep it elevated in cross-terms vs the Nzd. Elsewhere, the ebb and flow of safe-haven positioning plus Dollar moves have dominated the single currency, Yen and Franc along with coronavirus monitoring following signs that some countries in the Eurozone have plateaued vs Japan moving from part to full state of emergency and Switzerland still seeing rises (numerical if not percentage) in daily contamination and death rates. Hence, even greater intervention from the SNB and Government.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD: </strong>Sterling came back from the long UK holiday weekend with a fillip after PM Johnson’s discharge from hospital but failed to retain momentum as the lockdown was extended until at least May 7 and the OBR delivered a worrying worst-case scenario outlook for Q2 GDP and unemployment. Next up for the Pound, Moody’s ratings review with risk of a downgrade to the current standing and/or outlook. Similarly, the Loonie derived support from initial/fleeting upside in oil after the aforementioned OPEC+ pact but faded with the commodity and Stats Canada’s -9% preliminary GDP estimate for March just before the BoC policy meeting that matched consensus for unchanged rates. However, the Bank delayed updated MPR forecasts due to exceptionally high uncertainty over the outlook, though signalled worse to come via new QE programs for Provincial and Corporate paper on top of an enhanced up to 24-month term repo and raising the amount of T-bill purchases to 40% for a temporary period.</p><p><strong>EM: </strong>Some compensation or solace for regional currencies as the Usd retreats from best levels, but this does not tell the full story for some that saw more pronounced depreciation to fresh or prior all-time lows, while the Mxn also had to weather a Fitch ratings downgrade. Meanwhile, the Try slumped on a combination of factors, including lower FX swap limits, the ongoing spread of the coronavirus and attempted resignation of Turkey’s Interior Minister over the extended lockdown. Last, but by no means least in terms of event and drama, the Zar had to contend with a 100 bp emergency SARB rate cut when the scheduled meeting was brought forward in addition to dovish guidance from the Governor who said downside risks to inflation may warrant further easing depending on economic developments.</p>",

An initial Gilead-induced risk bounce, which sequentially faded, only for Treasuries to be offered after the release of the NY Fed’s new (reduced) scheduled of purchases for next week’s asset buys. After the 10-year yield found solace around the 0.60% figure on Thursday, the risk rally in later trade saw it back up to just beneath 0.70%, with the Fed set to by USD 15bln per day next week, down from USD 30bln. The further tapering of the Fed’s purchases saw the curve bear steepen. However, the cuts will be evenly distributed across maturities, which some analysts suggesting that gives credence to the view that the increasingly Fed-lite market could be expressing its view of increased inflation expectations; one strategist at Janney Montgomery noted that in the wake of the Fed’s QE1 and ZIRP announcement in 2008/09, there was a +75bps back up in long-end yields in the face of a deflationary environment, which saw 2s10s widen to around the 100bps area (2s10s currently sits just below 45bps).&nbsp;</p>",

Furthermore, the latest Genscape flyover of Cushing also indicates more large builds at the major hub. Citi also notes that one account shrugged off the USD 17/bbl WTI handle, suggesting that it would be 25 next week when June becomes the front month, but in the bank’s view, it says the large contango is not a sign of the bottom, rather that of a glut, where a bottom won’t be in until the spreads come in.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Another roller-coaster ride for risk sentiment and the Dollar that returned from Easter relatively refreshed, but came under renewed pressure when those centres away for a 4 day holiday weekend re-joined the fray. The Buck buckled and <strong>DXY </strong>fell to 98.813 from circa 99.508 at the start of play before reversing losses and eventually reclaiming 100.000+ status at 100.300 late Thursday. However, the index has subsequently faded after retesting wtd peaks, but falling a fraction short and it remains uncertain whether the Greenback closes out with net gains or DXY even above 99.500 given a raft of data and surveys showing more evidence of the economic toll on the US economy from measure taken to stop the spread of COVID-19. On that note, some promising news as President Trump sets guidelines to reopen states in lockdown and reports that a remedy has resulted in rapid recoveries for patients suffering with severe respiratory and fever symptoms.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has emerged as Friday’s top G10 performer, and from a technical perspective a close above the 200 HMA (0.6030-35) vs its US counterpart could be construed as constructive, but Nzd/Usd is still considerably weaker overall within 0.5923-0.6130 parameters after RNBZ Governor Orr reiterated the possibility of NIRP alongside more QE and direct financing if the nCoV contagion intensifies.</p><p><strong>NOK/AUD/EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The next best majors approaching the end of another truncated (EU) week, but with the Norwegian Krona off best levels vs the Euro on a post-OPEC+ downturn in crude prices following huge/record builds in US weekly inventories and significant downgrades in global demand forecasts from the IEA and OPEC itself, adding to the argument that the latest output cut accord will not be sufficient to address the supply overhang (or even glut). Back down under, the Aussie has been hostage to risk-on/off swings with brief relief taken from better than expected jobs data until buyers digested the fact that the reference point was prior to the closure of non-essential businesses and the true condition of the labour market will be seen in the next report. Nevertheless, Chinese trade and ip updates provided some encouragement over GDP and retail sales, with imports unexpectedly rising to offer hope for the Aud and keep it elevated in cross terms vs the Nzd. Elsewhere, the ebb and flow of safe-haven positioning plus Dollar moves have dominated the single currency, Yen and Franc along with coronavirus monitoring following signs that some countries in the Eurozone have plateaued vs Japan moving from part to full state of emergency and Switzerland still seeing rises (numerical if not percentage) in daily contamination and death rates. Hence, even greater intervention from the SNB and Government.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>Sterling came back from the long UK holiday weekend with a fillip after PM Johnson’s discharge from hospital, but failed to retain momentum as lockdown was extended until at least May 7 and the OBR delivered a worrying worst case scenario outlook for Q2 GDP and unemployment. Next up for the Pound, Moody’s ratings review with risk of downgrade to the current standing and/or outlook. Similarly, the Loonie derived support from initial/fleeting upside in oil after the aforementioned OPEC+ pact, but faded with the commodity and Stats Canada’s -9% preliminary GDP estimate for March just before the BoC policy meeting that matched consensus for unchanged rates. However, the Bank delayed updated MPR forecasts due to exceptionally high uncertainty over the outlook, though signalled worse to come via new QE programs for Provincial and Corporate paper on top of an enhanced up to 24 month term repo and raising the amount of T-bill purchases to 40% for a temporary period.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some compensation or solace for regional currencies as the Usd retreats from best levels, but this does not tell the full story for some that saw more pronounced depreciation to fresh or prior all time lows, while the Mxn also had to weather a Fitch ratings downgrade. Meanwhile, the Try slumped on on a combination of factors, including lower FX swap limits, the ongoing spread of the coronavirus and attempted resignation of Turkey’s Interior Minister over the extended lockdown. Last, but by no means least in terms of event and drama, the Zar had to contend with a 100 bp emergency SARB rate cut when the scheduled meeting was brought forward in addition to dovish guidance from the Governor who said downside risks to inflation may warrant further easing depending on economic developments.</p>",

        "subject": "US EQUITY OPEN: Indicies open firmer buoyed by positive remdesivir results and hopes on the economy reopening; Boeing (BA) set to resume some production Monday",
        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO:</strong> Global markets trade higher after US President Trump announced his three-phase plan to re-open the economy, while putting the decision to the state governors on when to re-open after a set of criteria has been met. Sentiment has also been buoyed by reports that Gilead’s (GILD) Remdesivir is seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory systems; however, Gilead caveated the report noting anecdotal reports do not provide the necessary power to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the drug. The dollar is softer, JPY firmer; although XAU is lower and treasury yields are little changed.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors open in positive territory, with the heavily-hit COVID-19 stocks outperforming on hopes of an economic reopen and vaccines. Production restarts at Boeing (BA) are also supportive. Staples (XLP) is the relative underperformer with typical COVID winners hampering the sector, with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST) &amp; Clorox (CLX) in the red. Similarly, Communication Services is a relative underperformer, with Netflix (NFLX) (another COVID winner) in negative territory. Elsewhere, Financials and Industrials lead gains, while energy is also firmly positive.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Proctor and Gamble (PG) beat on EPS, missed on revenue, but adjusted its FY 2020 sales growth view slightly lower, while maintaining guidance ranges for FY 2020. State Street (STT) beat on top and bottom line.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Gilead (GILD) Remdesivir was reported to have made rapid progress in treating severe COVID-19 patients in Chicago, seeing speedy recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, with nearly all in the closely observed clinical trial were discharged in a week. Gilead later said that anecdotal reports did not provide statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs, which sees a decline of 36% in Q2 iPhone units. Boeing (BA) is planning to resume commercial jet production in Seattle, Washington as early as Monday, providing some support to suppliers, such as Spirit AeroSystems (SPR). Ford Motor (F) looks for a net loss of around USD 2bln for Q1 2020, according to a SEC filing; expects an approximate USD 800mln tax expense in Q1. Moderna Inc. (MRNA) received USD 483mln in federal funding to accelerate its development of a coronavirus vaccine. Uber (UBER) has withdrawn its FY20 guidance while seeing its Q1 revenue to be cut by USD 17-22mln, and Q2 down by USD 60-80mln.</p><p><strong>LIQUIDITY: </strong>With volatility decreasing from the extremes in March, it would appear market liquidity has recovered from the stresses seen some analysts have said. However, Bank of America states “nothing could be farther from the truth”. The desk notes that while bid-ask spreads are tighter, there is a lack of depth to support the market “in anything larger than social amounts”. Given the COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictive measures, which is seeing less investor activity and less dealing room staff, the desk suggests the number of participants is appreciably smaller within an implied space, noting March volumes +27% Y/Y, but MTD April is expected to be 19% lower than 2019.</p><p><strong>EARNING EXPECTATIONS: </strong>Over the next three weeks 80% of S&amp;P500 companies are set to report with expectations changing recently. JP Morgan highlights Q1 S&amp;P 500 EPS growth rate has been revised to -11% Y/Y (-14% from the January high), and FY20 to -9% Y/Y (-21% from the high). The bank believes estimates are likely still too high due to limited corporate guidance, especially when comparing to Europe where revisions have been down 40 to 70%. The desk notes, with the previously mentioned factors, combined with a high dispersion in the consensus, which suggests high uncertainty/poor visibility, it expects “earnings season to be volatile with increasing risk of more companies suspending guidance and cutting shareholder return”. Overall, although the outlook on earnings is challenging, JPM maintains its positive view on US equities due to progress in governments mitigating the COVID-19 spread and large monetary and fiscal packages, and very favourable positioning; “Hedge funds equity beta at around the 10th percentile, CTAs could go long equities at around 2900, and vol-targeting funds should increase equity exposure”.</p>",

Phase 1) reopening of certain places such as restaurants, cinemas, gyms as long as they observe strict social distancing, high-risk individuals to stay at home, non-essential travel is discouraged 2) Travel can resume, schools can reopen, size of gatherings can be expanded and social distancing measures moderated, high-risk individuals to stay at home 3) High-risk individuals would not need to remain at home but would need to practice social distancing, large venues operate with limited social distancing rules, employers start lifting restrictions on staffing (Politico). Trump also noted that some states can reopen sooner than others and states which have met the criteria to start Phase 1 of reopening, can literally begin tomorrow</strong>. Furthermore, Trump commented that 29 states should be able to reopen relatively soon and that Governors will be empowered to tailor the approach to their own states and if they need to stay closed, that will be permitted. US President Trump's reopening guidelines suggested a 14-day downward trajectory in coronavirus cases before beginning a phased reopening although the document was said to not offer a specific timeframe for opening up the economy.

In addition, Boeing shares took off after-hours as the Co. plans to resume commercial airline production in Washington state factories next week. <strong>ASX 200 (+1.3%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+3.2%)</strong> surged from the open with corporate updates contributing to the stock rally in Australia including Rio Tinto which posted higher quarterly iron ore output and shipments, while Tokyo sentiment benefitted from the government’s relief efforts including the JPY 100k cash handouts to all citizens, and the <strong>TAIEX (+2.1%)</strong> was also boosted with chipmakers inspired by strong earnings from global semiconductor giant TSMC. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.5%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp.

Furthermore, Industrial Production and Retail Sales added to the varied narrative although China’s stats bureau remained optimistic in which it suggested a visible improvement in major economic indicators last month and likelihood of a continued recovery. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured amid spillover selling from T-notes with prices dampened as stocks rallied from US reopening guidelines and hopes of progress for COVID-19 treatment.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

The slight fade in risk appetite follows questions regarding whether reopening the US economy soon will revive an outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the second catalyst is attributed to Gilead’s treatment showing rapid recoveries among severe cases, but the Co. caveated stating the data does not satisfy safety and efficacy profiles. Traders may also be wary to open/hold onto risky positions heading into another weekend of uncertainty. Nonetheless, broad-based gains are seen across major European bourses as April option expiries provided the region with impetus, with CAC 40 (+3.8%) modestly outpacing peers amid post-earning gains from giants L’Oreal (+2.7%) and LVMH (+4.9%) – which together account for almost 14% of the French index and around 5% of the Euro Stoxx 50. Sectors are in the green across the board and lean towards a risk-on session – with cyclicals outperforming defensive. The breakdown sees Travel &amp; Leisure outperforming whilst the underperformance in Healthcare seems to be more of a risk-driven move. In terms of individual movers, Airbus (+8.7%) shares soar amid reports Boeing (+8.1% pre-mkt) is to resume production at its Seattle factory as soon as Monday next week. Thus, engine makers also gain impetus, with Rolls Royce (+11.3%) and Safran (+8.8%) buoyed. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto’s (+3.3%) iron ore shipment update supports share prices, with peers Antofagasta (+2.9%), Glencore (+9.0%), BHP (+5.1%) and Fresnillo (+2.0%) all higher in tandem. On the flip side, Diasorin (-7%) shares reside at the foot of the Stoxx 600, potentially Gilead seemingly leads the race between the Cos regarding antibody testing.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The Dollar is back in demand despite renewed risk appetite for global equities if nothing else on the back of more moves to scale back COVID-19 restrictions and positive anti-virus treatment results. The index has bounced firmly from 99.689 lows to reclaim 100.000+ status and is only marginally shy of Thursday’s 100.300 high amidst almost blanket Greenback gains vs G10 peers.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD -</strong> The Yen continues to resist the Buck’s advances and the bulk of safe-haven unwinding, with reports of Japanese offers into rebounds over 108.00 in Usd/Jpy capping the headline pair, while crosses remain bearish barring extreme bouts risk asset buying. On that note, the Kiwi has regained a degree of stability after yesterday’s RBNZ-related jolt to retest 0.6000 climes and reverse some underperformance against the Aussie, as the cross slips back below 1.0600 and Aud/Usd fades ahead of 0.6400 following mixed Chinese data overnight (GDP contraction not quite as bad as feared overall, retail sales weaker than forecast, but ip vice-versa).</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF/GBP</strong> - All making way for the latest broad Dollar upturn, as the Loonie retreats from just under 1.4000 to sub-1.4100 against the backdrop of waning oil prices and the Euro loses more momentum having failed to retain grip of the 1.0900 handle earlier this week. However, the single currency may derive some traction from option expiries again given hefty interest between 1.0835-50 (1.9 bn) and the 1.0800 strike (1.7 bn), in contrast to Usd/Cad that could see 1.9 bn at 1.4000 defended or protected. Meanwhile, the Franc is still caught in the crossfire in terms of weakness around 0.9700 vs the Greenback and strength relative to the Euro as Eur/Chf skirts 1.0500, but Sterling is softer across the board as Cable tops out above 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp rebounds through 0.8700. Note, the former continues to respect the 200 HMA at 1.2525 and latter is prone to almost daily or intraday periods of fix induced volatility. Ahead for the Pound, Moody’s UK ratings review poses downgrade risk to current standing and/or outlook.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> Contrasting fortunes for the Sek and Nok, as the aforementioned downturn in crude scuppers the Norwegian Krona irrespective of independent Euro weakness, while the Rub takes note of Brent contagion from WTI and guidance from the CBR Governor to the effect that a rate cut is on the agenda for the April 24 policy meeting.</p><p>BoC Governor Poloz said when we get back to normal, interest rates will certainly increase and that it will take the economy a couple of years to make up for lost ground. There were also comments from BoC’s Wilkins that recovery for Canada could begin over the summer but recovery from low oil prices could take longer, while she noted that their corporate bond program will purchase 1yr-5yr maturities.

Ahead, Fed’s Bullard and ECB’s Rehn both slated before US LEI that is almost bound to fall short of expectations or paint a gloomy picture at the very least, though whether enough to push bonds through established ranges and stocks out of their recovery stride is another question as positions are tweaked into the weekend.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI&nbsp;and&nbsp;Brent</strong>&nbsp;June&nbsp;futures&nbsp;remain choppy in early European trade, with the former’s June contract quoted given the shift in volume as its front-month expires in the coming days. Due to the colossal contango in the market,&nbsp;WTI&nbsp;May contract trades lower by some 9% (around USD 18/bbl), whilst the June future sees prices in the green on the day above USD 25.50/bbl at the time of writing. Market fundamentals remain unchanged thus far as participants await the OPEC+ pact to go into effect on May 1st, whilst on the lookout for commitments from outside the group. On that front, desks highlight that ConocoPhillips’ announcement regarding 200k BPD to its North American output highlights somewhat meaningful unmandated cuts outside OPEC+. Analysts at ING note “instead, market forces will do the job, with the low-price environment forcing producers to cut back.” Looking ahead to next week, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) is expected to revisit the issue on mandated state cuts. Supporters at the prior meeting on the 14th April argued about sever storage shortages and potential record numbers of bankruptcies amid market conditions. The effectiveness of the OPEC+ deal was also downplayed whilst they added that the RRC must do its part. Adversaries contended that the least profitable wells are already being shut and that RRC actions will not solve the crude crisis.&nbsp;WTI&nbsp;June resides towards the bottom end of the its intraday range, having waned off USD 26.78/bbl highs, whilst its&nbsp;Brent&nbsp;counterpart similarly declined from highs near USD 29/bbl. Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>spot&nbsp;gold</strong>&nbsp;remains on the backfoot and trades on either side of USD 1700/oz as DXY reclaims 100.000 to the upside, and with market contacts earlier reporting stops through 1705-1700/oz. The yellow metal thus far printed an intraday base at USD ~1687/oz, albeit remains in the green for the week having opened at USD ~1660/oz on Monday.<strong>&nbsp;Copper&nbsp;</strong>meanwhile withstands the strength in the Buck and moves in tandem with stocks following a shallower than expected contractions in Chinese QQ Q1 GDP and March Industrial Production, but prices remain capped by resistance at ~USD 2.3675/lb.</p><p>Russia's Kremlin when asked on low oil prices: says the output deal is yet to be implemented, does expect it to have an effect though.

The index has bounced firmly from 99.689 lows to reclaim 100.000+ status and is only marginally shy of Thursday’s 100.300 high amidst almost blanket Greenback gains vs G10 peers.</p><p>JPY/NZD/AUD - The Yen continues to resist the Buck’s advances and the bulk of safe-haven unwinding, with reports of Japanese offers into rebounds over 108.00 in Usd/Jpy capping the headline pair, while crosses remain bearish barring extreme bouts risk asset buying. On that note, the Kiwi has regained a degree of stability after yesterday’s RBNZ-related jolt to retest 0.6000 climes and reverse some underperformance against the Aussie, as the cross slips back below 1.0600 and Aud/Usd fades ahead of 0.6400 following mixed Chinese data overnight (GDP contraction not quite as bad as feared overall, retail sales weaker than forecast, but ip vice-versa).</p><p>CAD/EUR/CHF/GBP - All making way for the latest broad Dollar upturn, as the Loonie retreats from just under 1.4000 to sub-1.4100 against the backdrop of waning oil prices and the Euro loses more momentum having failed to retain grip of the 1.0900 handle earlier this week. However, the single currency may derive some traction from option expiries again given hefty interest between 1.0835-50 (1.9 bn) and the 1.0800 strike (1.7 bn), in contrast to Usd/Cad that could see 1.9 bn at 1.4000 defended or protected. Meanwhile, the Franc is still caught in the crossfire in terms of weakness around 0.9700 vs the Greenback and strength relative to the Euro as Eur/Chf skirts 1.0500, but Sterling is softer across the board as Cable tops out above 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp rebounds through 0.8700. Note, the former continues to respect the 200 HMA at 1.2525 and latter is prone to almost daily or intraday periods of fix induced volatility. Ahead for the Pound, Moody’s UK ratings review poses downgrade risk to current standing and/or outlook.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - Contrasting fortunes for the Sek and Nok, as the aforementioned downturn in crude scuppers the Norwegian Krona irrespective of independent Euro weakness, while the Rub takes note of Brent contagion from WTI and guidance from the CBR Governor to the effect that a rate cut is on the agenda for the April 24 policy meeting.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Marginal new intraday highs for <strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong>, at 172.77, 137.03 and 139-01 for the 10 year debt futures, but still not breaching wtd peaks amidst extended gains for EU equities on April index option expiry Friday. Ahead, Fed’s Bullard and ECB’s Rehn both slated before US LEI that is almost bound to fall short of expectations or paint a gloomy picture at the very least, though whether enough to push bonds through established ranges and stocks out of their recovery stride is another question as positions are tweaked into the weekend.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> <strong>June</strong> <strong>futures</strong> remain choppy in early European trade, with the former’s June contract quoted given the shift in volume as its front-month expires in the coming days. Due to the colossal contango in the market, <strong>WTI</strong> May contract trades lower by some 9% (around USD 18/bbl), whilst the June future sees prices in the green on the day above USD 25.50/bbl at the time of writing. Market fundamentals remain unchanged thus far as participants await the OPEC+ pact to go into effect on May 1st, whilst on the lookout for commitments from outside the group. On that front, desks highlight that ConocoPhillips’ announcement regarding 200k BPD to its North American output highlights somewhat meaningful unmandated cuts outside OPEC+. Analysts at ING note “instead, market forces will do the job, with the low-price environment forcing producers to cut back.” Looking ahead to next week, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) is expected to revisit the issue on mandated state cuts. Supporters at the prior meeting on the 14th April argued about sever storage shortages and potential record numbers of bankruptcies amid market conditions. The effectiveness of the OPEC+ deal was also downplayed whilst they added that the RRC must do its part. Adversaries contended that the least profitable wells are already being shut and that RRC actions will not solve the crude crisis. <strong>WTI</strong> June resides towards the bottom end of the its intraday range, having waned off USD 26.78/bbl highs, whilst its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart similarly declined from highs near USD 29/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains on the backfoot and trades on either side of USD 1700/oz as DXY reclaims 100.000 to the upside, and with market contacts earlier reporting stops through 1705-1700/oz. The yellow metal thus far printed an intraday base at USD ~1687/oz, albeit remains in the green for the week having opened at USD ~1660/oz on Monday. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile withstands the strength in the Buck and moves in tandem with stocks following a shallower than expected contractions in Chinese QQ Q1 GDP and March Industrial Production, but prices remain capped by resistance at ~USD 2.3675/lb.</p>",

However, the single currency may derive some traction from option expiries again given hefty interest between 1.0835-50 (1.9 bn) and the 1.0800 strike (1.7 bn), in contrast to Usd/Cad that could see 1.9 bn at 1.4000 defended or protected. Meanwhile, the Franc is still caught in the crossfire in terms of weakness around 0.9700 vs the Greenback and strength relative to the Euro as Eur/Chf skirts 1.0500, but Sterling is softer across the board as Cable tops out above 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp rebounds through 0.8700. Note, the former continues to respect the 200 HMA at 1.2525 and latter is prone to almost daily or intraday periods of fix induced volatility. Ahead for the Pound, Moody’s UK ratings review poses downgrade risk to current standing and/or outlook.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Sek and Nok, as the aforementioned downturn in crude scuppers the Norwegian Krona irrespective of independent Euro weakness, while the Rub takes note of Brent contagion from WTI and guidance from the CBR Governor to the effect that a rate cut is on the agenda for the April 24 policy meeting.</p>",

(FT)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the DXY softened overnight and pulled back below the 100.00 level amid the heightened risk appetite which spurred safe-haven outflows. This benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts including EUR/USD which recovered from the lows seen in the prior session, but with the gains in the single currency limited amid several large option expiries totalling nearly EUR 5bln spread out between 1.0800-1.0900 for today’s New York cut. Elsewhere, GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.2500 handle to wipe out the losses seen after the UK lockdown was extended by at least 3 more weeks as expected, USD/JPY slipped below 108.00 amid the USD woes, and antipodeans gained helped by their correlation to risk with AUD/USD rising north of 0.6350 and NZD/USD back above 0.6000.</p><p>BoC Governor Poloz said when we get back to normal, interest rates will certainly increase and that it will take the economy a couple of years to make up for lost ground. There were also comments from BoC’s Wilkins that recovery for Canada could begin over the summer but recovery from low oil prices could take longer, while she noted that their corporate bond program will purchase 1yr-5yr maturities.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> declined and briefly tested the USD 1700/oz level amid the lack of safe haven demand and <strong>copper</strong> rallied alongside the heightened risk appetite amid optimism of a sooner reopen of the US economy and on coronavirus treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Russian Energy Minister Novak and Saudi Energy Minister held a call and expressed commitment to the oil cut deals, while they are said to be willing to take more measures with other OPEC+ members and oil producers if needed.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury bid continued as equities slumped lower in recent ranges, with the shape of the curve bull-flattening; the Treasury Bond June future move over one-and-a-half points upwards, while the 2-year futures were little changed. By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3.5bps at 0.60%, and 30s -7bps at 1.20%. Similar to Wednesday, the lions’ share of strength came in the European session before the upward trajectory levelled-off in later trade, with real money accounts reportedly still heavy sellers into the Fed’s buyback operations. Further, as yields hit two-week lows, investors were likely cautious about extending the move. For instance, 2-year yield secular low was 0.143% on 9/20/2011, today’s low print of 0.187% is the lowest of this recent rally, a mere 4bps, or 2+/32, off the lows. More broadly, some Bond market participants have likely been enticed into longs given recent dismal data points, while value proxies in the equity market lead losses. In credit, Lipper data showed USD 5.184bln of inflows into investment grade rated funds in the latest week, the first inflow in six weeks, while HY rated funds saw their third week of inflows, a sign of stabilisation in the market, no doubt the Fed’s latest Primary/Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities will be reinvigorating investors as the bank has shown its commitment to backstopping credit markets. It is worth noting also that FRA-OIS spreads widened slightly amid USD LIBOR rose after eight consecutive declines; white strip Eurodollars were offered. US T-note futures (M0) settled 2+ ticks higher at 139-07+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Williams (voter, neutral</strong>) said stresses in financial market will not entirely abate until the pandemic is behind us and that the NY Fed is taking rapid and significant actions to promote liquidity and stability. Williams also stated the Fed is limited in what it can and should do, while he suggested fiscal policy is playing the main role. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bostic (non-voter, dove)</strong> said hopefully the rebound in the economy means the Fed's lending will be repaid quickly and the balance sheet will \"resolve itself\", while he is looking for further market stresses and stated the Fed is willing to do more with Treasury backed facilities if needed. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Harker (voter, hawk)</strong> said the Fed is not going to bring all financial markets to where they were but it can help them function and that policy will stay low until the dual mandate can be reached. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kaplan (voter, dove)</strong> said the US economy will start to grow in Q3 and believes peak unemployment will be at the mid-high teens but expects it to fall to 8-10% by year end.

In related news, US Senate <strong>Majority Leader McConnell said there has been \"absolutely no progress\" among lawmakers to come to an agreement on pay check funding for small businesses</strong>, although there were later comments from US Senate Democrat leader Schumer that talks on additional relief funding are ongoing.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets notched firm gains as they tracked the advances in US equity futures following the announcement of reopening guidelines for the US economy and amid hopes of a COVID-19 treatment after positive results for Gilead's Remdesivir drug in closely observed clinical trials, despite the Co. downplaying the reports. In addition, Boeing shares took off after-hours as the Co. plans to resume commercial airline production in Washington state factories next week. ASX 200 (+1.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.4%) surged from the open with corporate updates contributing to the stock rally in Australia including Rio Tinto which posted higher quarterly iron ore output and shipments, while Tokyo sentiment benefitted from the government’s relief efforts including the JPY 100k cash handouts to all citizens, and the TAIEX (+2.2%) was also boosted with chipmakers inspired by strong earnings from global semiconductor giant TSMC. Hang Seng (+2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) conformed to the broad optimism following reports the PBoC will continue to the guide credit funds to support smaller firms through targeted RRR cuts and with the gains maintained regardless of the slew of mixed tier-1 data which showed Chinese GDP Y/Y at -6.8% vs. Exp. -6.5% Y/Y, although GDP Q/Q was at a slightly narrower than expected contraction. Furthermore, Industrial Production and Retail Sales added to the varied narrative although China’s stats bureau remained optimistic in which it suggested a visible improvement in major economic indicators last month and likelihood of a continued recovery. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured amid spillover selling from T-notes with prices dampened as stocks rallied from US reopening guidelines and hopes of progress for COVID-19 treatment.</p>",

In addition, Boeing shares took off after-hours as the Co. plans to resume commercial airline production in Washington state factories next week. ASX 200 (+2.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.5%) surged from the open with corporate updates contributing to the stock rally in Australia including Rio Tinto which posted higher quarterly iron ore output and shipments, while Tokyo sentiment benefits from the government’s relief efforts including the JPY 100k cash handouts to all citizens, and the TAIEX is also boosted with chipmakers inspired by strong earnings from global semiconductor giant TSMC. Hang Seng (+2.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) conform to the broad optimism following reports the PBoC will continue to the guide credit funds to support smaller firms through targeted RRR cuts and with the gains maintained regardless of the slew of mixed tier-1 data which showed Chinese GDP Y/Y at -6.8% vs. Exp. -6.5% Y/Y, although GDP Q/Q was at a slightly narrower than expected contraction. Furthermore, Industrial Production and Retail Sales added to the varied narrative although China’s stats bureau was optimistic in which it suggested a visible improvement in major economic indicators last month and that the recovery will likely continue.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY softened overnight and pulled back below the 100.00 level amid the heightened risk appetite which spurred safe-haven outflows. This benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts including EUR/USD which recovered from the lows seen in the prior session where ECB President Lagarde noted the bank is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programme by as much as necessary and for as long as needed, but with the gains in the single currency limited amid several large option expiries totalling nearly EUR 5bln spread out between 1.0800-1.0900 for today’s New York cut. Elsewhere, GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.2500 handle to wipe out the losses seen after the UK lockdown was extended by at least 3 more weeks as expected, USD/JPY slipped below 108.00 amid the USD woes, and antipodeans gained helped by their correlation to risk with AUD/USD rising north of 0.6350 and NZD/USD back above 0.6000.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured amid spillover selling from T-notes with prices dampened as stocks rally from hopes of a US reopen and COVID-19 treatment progress.</p>",
