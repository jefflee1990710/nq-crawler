ECB&rsquo;s Mersch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK:</strong> Ultimately, there wasn&rsquo;t anything particularly new in the Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s remarks. Once again, Powell reiterated &lsquo;patience and flexibility&rsquo;, again saying that the Fed is not on a pre-set course, and again said that the Fed can move &lsquo;flexibly and quickly&rsquo; if data warrants it. There were some negative ticks in risk assets after Powell said that the balance sheet run-off should continue, though he did not know the ideal level that the size it should be shrunk to, adding that it will be &ldquo;substantially smaller&rdquo;. Powell identified global growth as his principle concern for 2019. Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (voter, dove) made familiar dovish arguments, saying that the Fed is sufficiently pre-emptive on inflation, and should be moderate in normalising policy; he also said market inflation expectations suggest current stance on monetary policy is too hawkish. Bullard said he was moderately concerned that global slowdown will worsen. Later, Bullard said that the December hike was an &lsquo;overreach&rsquo;, warning that the Fed was on the precipice of a policy mistake. Fed&#39;s Evans (voter, dove) says FOMC can easily assess the data for six months before lifting rates. Vice chair Clarida speaks after the bell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE NEGOTIATIONS: </strong>US President Trump once again said he is having &lsquo;tremendous success; in negotiations with China on trade. On the Chinese side, Vice President Qishan urged dialogue and consultations to try and achieve better US/China ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>There are still no signs that lawmakers are closer to securing a deal to reopen the government. Trump again touted his ability to declare a national emergency in order to secure funds for his border wall, adding that he was not at that point yet, but would do so if the shutdown continues. Credit rating agency Moody&#39;s estimates that the shutdown could reduce US economic output by $8.7bln if it was to persist until the end of January, though said that the shutdown had no immediate implications for the US credit rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> Claims fell to 216k against a consensus 233k. Analysts suggested that the figure might have been even lower had the US government shutdown not played a role. SocGen suggested that around 380k of the 800k workers furloughed by the US government shutdown become eligible to submit jobless claims, and said we should not be surprised to see a large increase in next week&rsquo;s data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES SETTLE UNCHANGED AT 121-23: </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened modestly on Thursday, with 2s30s and 5s30s wider by 4bps at settlement. The US auction of 30-year bonds was grim, tailing by 1.1bps, and adding pressure to the long-end, not helped by corporate supply. Cover was weaker, directs took the largest takedown since Dec 2014, indirects the smallest since November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) SETTLES +$0.23 AT $52.59; BRENT (H9) SETTLES +$0.24 AT $61.88: </strong>Crude prices rose modestly, seeing WTI rise for the eighth straight session; for much of the session, crude was straddling the neutral line, with some suggestion that traders perceived Wednesday&rsquo;s gains as outsized given the larger than forecast build in the products, leading to some profit-taking. &ldquo;While the ability of a market to rally in the face of bearish news may be the hallmark of a bull market, it&rsquo;s also possible the rally may have gotten a bit ahead of itself,&rdquo; Citi said. &ldquo;Market sentiment may be running stronger and the OPEC+ production cuts may be helping the market rebalance, but rising US production and inventories still represent fundamental headwinds.&rdquo; In other news, Iraq&rsquo;s oil minister stated his belief that oil price declines have now ceased, and sees prices gradually recovering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX % at, NDX % at, DJI % at. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.29%, Materials +0.87%, Industrials +1.42%, Cons Discretionary -0.24%, Cons Staples +0.61%, Healthcare +0.23%, Financials +0.13%, Tech +0.46%, Telecoms +0.19%, Utilities +1.39%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS:</strong> retail stocks were hit after Macy&rsquo;s (M) reported disappointing SSS for the holiday season; Guidance from Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS), Target (TGT) and L Brands (LB) also underwhelmed. On the flip side, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) outperformed after strong earnings. Constellation Brands (STZ) pared back some of yesterday&rsquo;s post-earnings losses thanks to an upgrade at Goldman. PG&amp;E (PCG) continues its recovery, as a US judge proposing stricter restrictions on how the co. operates in wild fire seasons. Twitter (TWTR) opened higher after a double broker upgrade. Utilities were firm, lead by gains in General Electric (GE). American Airlines (AAL) dragged after disappointing metrics for Q4, with United Airlines (UAL) also down likely in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> The DXY rose, finding support above 95.00, with traders citing a combination of paring back bearish bets as we await progress on trade talks, the government shutdown, as well as the EUR struggling to build on Wednesday&rsquo;s breach of 1.15. The dollar&rsquo;s rise was not part of a flight to safety, and dovish Fedspeak acted to cap gains; the CHF and JPY were weaker (the former notably so, leading to the usual speculation of SNB intervention). EMDX came under the cosh of USD strength, with the exception of the MXN (after Mexico announced an IPO tax cut incentive). The other dollars were mixed, with CAD dancing the tune of crude, while NZD probes downside, though the AUD is higher heading into APAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>The ECB&rsquo;s December minutes garnered little market attention, given the lack of fresh insight, and the minutes being slightly dated given recent macro developments. They did however reveal that the case was made for assessing risks to economic activity in the Eurozone as tilted to the downside, not too surprising given that the language in the final statement was clearly a compromise of sorts. Interestingly, it was remarked that the decline in oil prices and likely fiscal stimulus were upside risks with the board concluding that the risk situation is fragile and fluid. On the subject of TLTRO&rsquo;s, the suggestion was made to revisit the contribution of the funding measures to monetary policy stance looking ahead.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Wrap: Buck boosted as Fed speakers and US CPI home in ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; A positive day for the index despite yesterday&rsquo;s dovish Fed and FOMC minutes release, as the lack of progress in key sticking points between US and China aided the DXY to march closer to 95.500 and post fresh session highs throughout the day, ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s long-awaited US CPI release. In terms of Fed speakers, so far non-voter Barkin emerged, though he mentioned very little in way of monetary policy. Still to come, Fed Chair Powell, Vice Chair Clarida and 2019 voters Bullard and Evans takes the stage, while US President Trump participates in a roundtable meeting on border security around 14:10EST as the US government shutdown reaches its 20th day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong> &ndash; Both remain under the trance of a rising buck, though the single currency was little changed by the release of the ECB Minutes, which stated that risks to the EZ economy are tilted to the downside, while suggestions were made to revisit the contribution of TLTRO to monetary policy stance looking ahead, EUR/USD remained marginally above the 1.1500 handle ahead of its 50 HMA at 1.1490 and 100 DMA at 1.1478. Elsewhere, Sterling was mostly dominated by the rising buck, though the Brexit headlines did seem to offer further downside as uncertainties surrounding Brexit grow rather than shrink ahead of the meaningful vote on the 15th January. UK Commons Leader Leadsom stated the Government will accept Parliament&#39;s demand to set out an alternate Brexit plan within three days in PM May&#39;s deal is rejected, though the PM is reportedly considering supporting an amendment in an attempt to court some Labour MPs into supporting her deal. Cable sits around the middle of a 1.2730-2800 range after having breached its 100 DMA at 1.2746 ahead of the psychological 1.2700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD </strong>&ndash; The marked G10 outperformer as the antipodean tracked the rally in the Yuan despite little details emerging from US-Sino trade talks. During Asia-Pac hours the AUD was briefly dented by the disappointing Chinese inflation figures, though AUD/USD pared back losses amid an overnight rebound in copper prices. AUD/USD straddles around the middle of a 50-pip range after having retested 0.7200 as US participants entered the market (vs. low of 0.7150) and in close proximity to its 50 and 100 DMA at 0.7190 and 0.7182 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong> &ndash; Mixed trade for the traditional safe-haven currencies as USD/JPY traded sideways on either side on 108.00 as dollar gains were neutralised by safe-haven demand into the JPY amid sticking points remaining in US-Sino trade talks, including IP. In terms of technical, the next support level to the downside stands at 107.52 (4th Jan low). Meanwhile the Franc is suspiciously on the backfoot and stands as the major G10 underperformer, with possible SNB intervention taking place in light of the dovish Fed speakers and FOMC threatening the already &ldquo;overvalued&rdquo; currency. USD/CHF sits just below 0.9800 having breached its 50 DMA at 0.9780 to the upside to already tested the psychological level ahead of its 50 HMA at 0.9805.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD, NOK</strong> &ndash; With little reaction to the Canadian housing data, the Loonie tracked losses in the energy complex throughout the session. USD/CAD resides in close proximity to the 1.3250 level having tested the level in early EU trade as the pair straddled around its 50 HMA at 1.3241 shortly after the Wall St. open. The Norwegian Crown however dismissed the oil decline and was underpinned by the optimistic inflation figures released early in the day as EUR/NOK hovered around session lows of 9.7461 with its 50 DMA in sight around 0.9730. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Bunds have set a new session peak of 164.16 but have reverted to trade in the middle of today&rsquo;s 43 tick range after a mixed French auction and were essentially unreactive to an unsurprisingly lacklustre ECB minutes release. Traders now look forward to potential comments from ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the USTs are maintaining outperformance in the longer end of the curve as 10-year futures lag around the 121-27 level ahead of a raft of Fed speakers, which has already been kicked off by Barkin (who sees US growth slowing in 2019) and is set to continue with comments from Powell, Bullard, Evans, Kashkari and Clarida yet to come. Supply also remains in focus, with AB InBev announcing a USD 11bln 6-parter ahead of the USD 16bln 30yr bond auction later in the day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) were subdued after sentiment in the region soured with BHP shares hit in Australia as it traded ex-dividend, while the Japanese benchmark underperformed as exporters took the brunt of detrimental currency moves. Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) initially weakened as trade-related momentum began to wane, with sentiment also dampened after the PBoC drained another CNY 70bln from the interbank market and after soft Chinese inflation data added to the despondent tone. However, Chinese stocks then staged a gradual recovery throughout the session, while in terms of trade news, both US and China have issued separate statements in the aftermath of the trade discussions, although the sides refrained from a joint statement and there was also no mention of a timeline moving forward. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned by the initial safe-haven demand which coincided with gains in T-notes in the wake of the Fed dovishness, although prices are off best levels as risk sentiment in the region began to recover, while mixed results at today&rsquo;s 30yr JGB auction proved to be inconclusive for prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are in the red [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.4%] following on from the mixed performance seen in Asia on the lack of US-China trade clarity. Some underperformance is seen in the CAC (-0.8%), weighed on by Safran (-3.6%) who were downgraded at JP Morgan Chase, and Airbus (-1.7%) in the red after posting fewer net orders than Boeing for the first time in 5 years. Sectors are similarly in the red, with slight outperformance seen in utility names. Other notable movers include Sodexo (+1.8%) who are up after posting an increase in Q1 revenue. Separately, Tesco (+1.0%) are positive after the Co say that they remain on track to deliver their FY outlook, similarly Marks and Spencer (+1.5%) are in the green after the Co saying their FY guidance remains unchanged; despite UK BRC retail sales for December missing with -0.7% vs. Exp. -0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; On a firmer footing in early EU trade despite yesterday&rsquo;s dovish Fed speakers and FOMC Minutes which stated that many policymakers said the Fed could be patient about further tightening amid muted inflationary pressures. Additionally, policymakers stated that it was appropriate to hike rates in Dec 2018, though some members favoured no change. Furthermore, due to the recent stock rout, volatility in markets and global growth concerns, the extent and time of future policy tightening is &ldquo;less clean than earlier.&rdquo; As such the DXY tested 95.000 to the downside during Asia-Pac hours in a continuation of USD weakness from Wall St., though the index rebounded off the psychological level and marches closer towards 95.500 (intra-day high of 95.381) ahead of a plethora of Fed speakers including Chair Powell, Vice Chair Clarida and 2019 voters Bullard and Evans. It is also worth bearing in mind that US President Trump is to participate in a roundtable meeting on border security around 18:00 GMT as the government shutdown reaches its 20th day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; The G10 outperformer, albeit marginally after the Aussie was dented by the release of disappointing Chinese December inflation figures which briefly pressured the currency during the Asia-Pac session. An overnight rebound in copper prices however underpinned AUD/USD north of 0.7150, just below its 50 DMA at 0.7190 with options scattered around 0.7190-0.7220 (1.1bln).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK, CAD &ndash; Firmer than expected Norwegian CPI gave the Crown impetus to extend gains below 9.80 vs. the EUR, thought EUR/NOK saw volatile trade shortly post-release amid negative price action in the oil complex. Ultimately, the NOK regained composure as EUR/NOK sits below its 50 HMA at 9.7750 ahead of its 50 DMA at 9.7290. Meanwhile the Loonie bears the brunt of declining oil as USD/CAD trades just below its 50 HMA at 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR,GBP &ndash; Both victimised by the firmer greenback, though the single currency was unfazed by dismal French industrial production numbers ahead of the ECB Minutes later today (full preview available on the Research Suite). EUR/USD is subsequently only marginally above 1.1500 with the next level to the downside at its 50 HMA (1.1490) ahead of its 100 DMA (1.1478). Large option expiries may cap upside in the pair with 1bln on the money at 1.1515-25 and 1.3bln around the psychological 1.1500. Moving on, Sterling suffers a similar fate as the strengthening buck sent cable further below 1.2800 to breach 1.2750 and test 1.2730. In terms of the latest, Opposition leader Corbyn is again call for a general election today amid the Brexit deadlock, if PM May&rsquo;s deal does not pass the meaningful vote on January 15th. In light of this, the Premier is reportedly considering supporting an amendment in an attempt to court some Labour MPs into supporting her deal. Cable sits around the middle of a 1.2750-2800 range with its 100 DMA at 1.2746.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Marginally softer following overnight upside from the dovish Fed and FOMC minutes as the buck eased and the Yen appreciated on safe-haven demand. As the greenback gained traction in EU trade, USD/JPY reclaimed the 108.00 handle to the upside with the pair&rsquo;s 100 and 50 DMA at 108.46 and 108.50 respectively with 800mln in option expiries around 108-40-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU fixed income kicked off the European session with a gap higher on the open but since has tempered its upside slightly, with Gilts now essentially unchanged for the day vs. yesterday&rsquo;s close of 123.41, and Bunds trading marginally in the positive and just above the 164.00 handle. This comes following European supply out of France in their EUR 8-9bln 2028, 2034 and 2048 auction, and further down the line more direction may be set by ECB speak from Villeroy and minutes from the ECB&rsquo;s December meeting. On a technical standpoint Bunds are capped by the 3rd of Jan low as resistance of 164.38. In the periphery, BTPs are underperforming their European peers, albeit marginally, with the Italian benchmark trading within a thin 50 tick range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, USTs are seeing some upside across the curve with most of the action in the long end but off overnight highs after the Presidents &ldquo;waste of time&rdquo; tantrum extending the Government shutdown. The border wall battle in the US overshadowed some dovish FOMC minutes, with participants looking for dovish reaffirmation by Powell later in the day, with Barkin, Bullard, Evans and Kashkari also set to speak. On the supply side, USD 16bln will be rolling off at the 30yr auction later in the day after yesterday&rsquo;s well received 10yr auction, with saw a large proportion of directs and a stop through of 0.8bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.7%) and WTI (-0.7%) are in the red, though the benchmarks reclaimed USD 61/bbl and USD 52/bbl respectively in EU trade with no attributed fundamentals to the recent price action. Previous sessions EIA showed a smaller than expected draw in crude oil inventories of -1.68mln vs. Exp. -2.7mln. Elsewhere, Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih comments that he would not rule out additional OPEC+ action at some point in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) was initial buoyed by the dovish FOMC minutes, although the yellow metal is now trading towards the bottom of today&rsquo;s USD 6/oz range as the dollar modestly firms. Elsewhere, according to reports US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is to meet Democrats today to discuss plans to end sanctions against Rusal; of note Democrats have asked for the removal of these sanctions to be delayed. In a vote on January 16th, EU countries are expected to approve a scheme limiting imports of steel into the bloc; placing a cap on steel imports for 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia December Port Hedland iron ore shipments to China 37.4mln tons vs. Prev. 32.9mln tons. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norway&rsquo;s preliminary 2018 oil production was 86.2mln cubic meters vs. 90.2mln cubic meters forecast. NPD forecasts Norway&rsquo;s 2019 oil production at 82.2mln cubic meters vs. 82.7 prior forecast.

Some underperformance is seen in the CAC (-0.5%), weighed on by Safran (-3.6%) who were downgraded at JP Morgan Chase, and Airbus (-1.4%) in the red after posting fewer net orders than Boeing for the first time in 5 years. Sectors are similarly in the red, with slight outperformance seen in utility names. Other notable movers include Sodexo (+1.7%) who are up after posting an increase in Q1 revenue. Separately, Tesco (+1.4%) are positive after the Co say that they remain on track to deliver their FY outlook, similarly Marks and Spencer (+1.6%) are in the green after the Co saying their FY guidance remains unchanged; despite UK BRC retail sales for December missing with -0.7% vs. Exp. -0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; On a firmer footing in early EU trade despite yesterday&rsquo;s dovish Fed speakers and FOMC Minutes which stated that many policymakers said the Fed could be patient about further tightening amid muted inflationary pressures. Additionally, policymakers stated that it was appropriate to hike rates in Dec 2018, though some members favoured no change. Furthermore, due to the recent stock rout, volatility in markets and global growth concerns, the extent and time of future policy tightening is &ldquo;less clean than earlier.&rdquo; As such the DXY tested 95.000 to the downside during Asia-Pac hours in a continuation of USD weakness from Wall St., though the index rebounded off the psychological level and marches closer towards 95.500 (intra-day high of 95.370) ahead of a plethora of Fed speakers including Chair Powell, Vice Chair Clarida and 2019 voters Bullard and Evans. It is also worth bearing in mind that US President Trump is to participate in a roundtable meeting on border security around 18:00 GMT as the government shutdown reaches its 20th day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; The G10 outperformer, albeit marginally after the Aussie was dented by the release of disappointing Chinese December inflation figures which briefly pressured the currency during the Asia-Pac session. An overnight rebound in copper prices however underpinned AUD/USD north of 0.7150 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.7190 with options scattered around 0.7190-0.7220 (1.1bln).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK, CAD &ndash; Firmer than expected Norwegian CPI gave the Crown impetus to extend gains below 9.80 vs. the EUR, thought EUR/NOK saw volatile trade shortly post-release amid negative price action in the oil complex. Ultimately, the NOK regained composure as EUR/NOK sits below its 50 HMA at 9.7750 ahead of its 50 DMA at 9.7290. Meanwhile the Loonie bears the brunt of declining oil as USD/CAD trades just below its 50 HMA at 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR,GBP &ndash; Both victimised by the firmer greenback, though the single currency was unfazed by dismal French industrial production numbers ahead of the ECB Minutes later today (full preview available on the Research Suite). EUR/USD is subsequently only marginally1.1500 with the next level to the downside at its 50 HMA (1.1490) ahead of its 100 DMA (1.1478). Large option expiries may cap upside in the pair with 1bln on the money at 1.1515-25 and 1.3bln around the psychological 1.1500. Moving on, Sterling suffers a similar fate as the strengthening buck sent cable further below 1.2800 to test 1.2750 at one point. In terms of the latest, Opposition leader Corbyn is again call for a general election today amid the Brexit deadlock, if PM May&rsquo;s deal does not pass the meaningful vote on January 15th. In light of this, the Premier is reportedly considering supporting an amendment in an attempt to court some Labour MPs into supporting her deal. Cable sits around the middle of a 1.2750-2800 range with its 100 DMA at 1.2746.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Marginally softer following overnight upside from the dovish Fed and FOMC minutes as the buck eased and the Yen appreciated on safe-haven demand. As the greenback gained traction in EU trade, USD/JPY reclaimed the 108.00 handle to the upside with the pair&rsquo;s 100 and 50 DMA at 108.46 and 108.50 respectively with 800mln in option expiries around 108-40-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU fixed income kicked off the European session with a gap higher on the open but since has tempered its upside slightly, with Gilts now essentially unchanged for the day vs. yesterday&rsquo;s close of 123.41, and Bunds trading marginally in the positive and just above the 164.00 handle. This comes following European supply out of France in their EUR 8-9bln 2028, 2034 and 2048 auction, and further down the line more direction may be set by ECB speak from Villeroy and minutes from the ECB&rsquo;s December meeting. On a technical standpoint Bunds are capped by the 3rd of Jan low as resistance of 164.38. In the periphery, BTPs are underperforming their European peers, albeit marginally, with the Italian benchmark trading within a thin 50 tick range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, USTs are seeing some upside across the curve with most of the action in the long end but off overnight highs after the Presidents &ldquo;waste of time&rdquo; tantrum extending the Government shutdown. The border wall battle in the US overshadowed some dovish FOMC minutes, with participants looking for dovish reaffirmation by Powell later in the day, with Barkin, Bullard, Evans and Kashkari also set to speak. On the supply side, USD 16bln will be rolling off at the 30yr auction later in the day after yesterday&rsquo;s well received 10yr auction, with saw a large proportion of directs and a stop through of 0.8bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.5%) and WTI (-0.6%) are in the red, though the benchmarks reclaimed USD 61/bbl and USD 52/bbl respectively in EU trade with no attributed fundamentals to the recent price action. Previous sessions EIA showed a smaller than expected draw in crude oil inventories of -1.68mln vs. Exp. -2.7mln. Elsewhere, Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih comments that he would not rule out additional OPEC+ action at some point in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) was initial buoyed by the dovish FOMC minutes, although the yellow metal is now trading towards the bottom of today&rsquo;s USD 6/oz range as the dollar modestly firms. Elsewhere, according to reports US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is to meet Democrats today to discuss plans to end sanctions against Rusal; of note Democrats have asked for the removal of these sanctions to be delayed.

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: DXY marches forward with a slew of Fed speakers in sight",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; On a firmer footing in early EU trade despite yesterday&rsquo;s dovish Fed speakers and FOMC Minutes which stated that many policymakers said the Fed could be patient about further tightening amid muted inflationary pressures. Additionally, policymakers stated that it was appropriate to hike rates in Dec 2018, though some members favoured no change. Furthermore, due to the recent stock rout, volatility in markets and global growth concerns, the extent and time of future policy tightening is &ldquo;less clean than earlier.&rdquo; As such the DXY tested 95.000 to the downside during Asia-Pac hours in a continuation of USD weakness from Wall St., though the index rebounded off the psychological level and marches closer towards 95.500 (intra-day high of 95.370) ahead of a plethora of Fed speakers including Chair Powell, Vice Chair Clarida and 2019 voters Bullard and Evans. It is also worth bearing in mind that US President Trump is to participate in a roundtable meeting on border security around 18:00 GMT as the government shutdown reaches its 20th day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD </strong>&ndash; The G10 outperformer, albeit marginally after the Aussie was dented by the release of disappointing Chinese December inflation figures which briefly pressured the currency during the Asia-Pac session. An overnight rebound in copper prices however underpinned AUD/USD north of 0.7150 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.7190 with options scattered around 0.7190-0.7220 (1.1bln).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOK, CAD</strong> &ndash; Firmer than expected Norwegian CPI gave the Crown impetus to extend gains below 9.80 vs. the EUR, thought EUR/NOK saw volatile trade shortly post-release amid negative price action in the oil complex. Ultimately, the NOK regained composure as EUR/NOK sits below its 50 HMA at 9.7750 ahead of its 50 DMA at 9.7290. Meanwhile the Loonie bears the brunt of declining oil as USD/CAD trades just below its 50 HMA at 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR,GBP</strong> &ndash; Both victimised by the firmer greenback, though the single currency was unfazed by dismal French industrial production numbers ahead of the ECB Minutes later today (full preview available on the Research Suite). EUR/USD is subsequently only marginally1.1500 with the next level to the downside at its 50 HMA (1.1490) ahead of its 100 DMA (1.1478). Large option expiries may cap upside in the pair with 1bln on the money at 1.1515-25 and 1.3bln around the psychological 1.1500. Moving on, Sterling suffers a similar fate as the strengthening buck sent cable further below 1.2800 to test 1.2750 at one point. In terms of the latest, Opposition leader Corbyn is again call for a general election today amid the Brexit deadlock, if PM May&rsquo;s deal does not pass the meaningful vote on January 15th. In light of this, the Premier is reportedly considering supporting an amendment in an attempt to court some Labour MPs into supporting her deal. Cable sits around the middle of a 1.2750-2800 range with its 100 DMA at 1.2746.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; Marginally softer following overnight upside from the dovish Fed and FOMC minutes as the buck eased and the Yen appreciated on safe-haven demand. As the greenback gained traction in EU trade, USD/JPY reclaimed the 108.00 handle to the upside with the pair&rsquo;s 100 and 50 DMA at 108.46 and 108.50 respectively with 800mln in option expiries around 108-40-50.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Core EU fixed income kicked off the European session with a gap higher on the open but since has tempered its upside slightly, with Gilts now essentially unchanged for the day vs. yesterday&rsquo;s close of 123.41, and Bunds trading marginally in the positive and just above the 164.00 handle. This comes ahead of further European supply coming out of France in their EUR 8-9bln 2028, 2034 and 2048 auction, and further down the line more direction may be set by ECB speak from Villeroy and minutes from the ECB&rsquo;s December meeting. On a technical standpoint Bunds are capped by the 3rd of Jan low as resistance of 164.38. In the periphery, BTPs are underperforming their European peers, albeit marginally, with the Italian benchmark trading within a thin 40 tick range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, USTs are seeing some upside across the curve with most of the action in the long end but off overnight highs after the Presidents &ldquo;waste of time&rdquo; tantrum extending the Government shutdown. The border wall battle in the US overshadowed some dovish FOMC minutes, with participants looking for dovish reaffirmation by Powell later in the day, with Barkin, Bullard, Evans and Kashkari also set to speak. On the supply side, USD 16bln will be rolling off at the 30yr auction later in the day after yesterday&rsquo;s well received 10yr auction, with saw a large proportion of directs and a stop through of 0.8bps.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) were subdued after sentiment in the region soured with BHP shares hit in Australia as it traded ex-dividend, while the Japanese benchmark underperformed as exporters took the brunt of detrimental currency moves. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) initially weakened as trade-related momentum began to wane, with sentiment also dampened after the PBoC drained another CNY 70bln from the interbank market and after soft Chinese inflation data added to the despondent tone. However, Chinese stocks then staged a gradual recovery throughout the session, while in terms of trade news, both US and China have issued separate statements in the aftermath of the trade discussions, although the sides refrained from a joint statement and there was also no mention of a timeline moving forward. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned by the initial safe-haven demand which coincided with gains in T-notes in the wake of the Fed dovishness, although prices are off best levels as risk sentiment in the region began to recover, while mixed results at today&rsquo;s 30yr JGB auction proved to be inconclusive for prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8160 (Prev. 6.8526)<br /><br />Chinese CPI (Dec) Y/Y 1.9% vs. Exp. 2.1% (Prev. 2.2%). (Newswires)<br />Chinese PPI (Dec) Y/Y 0.9% vs. Exp. 1.6% (Prev. 2.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom issued a statement on trade talks with US in which it stated that China and US agree to continue close communication on trade and that sides had broad, deep and detailed communication. Furthermore, Mofcom said that talks promoted mutual understanding and established a foundation for resolution of each other&rsquo;s concerns, while both sides agreed to maintain close contact. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to be mulling supporting an amendment that would keep EU regulations regarding pay and conditions, health and safety as well as environmental standards in an effort to garner support for her Brexit deal. (Sky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit approach is seen as being in tatters after Conservative Rebels opened discussions with Labour regarding an alternative to her deal. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Labour leader Corbyn is to reiterate his call for a general election today to break the Brexit deadlock, if PM May&#39;s deal is voted down in the House of Commons on January 15th. (The Guardian). The Times reports, that Shadow Brexit Secretary Starmer has told Jeremy Corbyn that a second referendum could now be the only option to avoid a no-deal Brexit. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK BRC Retail Sales (Dec) Y/Y -0.7% vs. Exp. -0.3% (Prev. -0.5%). (Newswires)<br />UK Barclaycard Consumer Spending (Dec) Y/Y 1.8% (Prev. 3.3%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have quietened with most major currencies holding on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains against the greenback following dovish Fed speakers and the FOMC Minutes. This has kept the DXY within proximity of the 95.00 level to the downside and EUR/USD near the prior day&rsquo;s highs at the 1.1500 handle. High beta currencies were choppy alongside the risk sentiment with AUD briefly dampened by the soft Chinese inflation data, while USD/JPY was pressured to trade at a sub-108.00 level as it took a double whammy from the impact of the dovish Fed tone on USD and early safe-haven flows into JPY. Elsewhere, CNH took its swipe at the greenback in which it firmed to under 6.8000 after the PBoC adjusted the reference rate to its strongest since August 30th.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean President Moon said he expects a 2nd Trump-Kim summit soon, However, there were also comments from the South Korea Ambassador to US that US-North Korea nuclear talks have slowed and that it could take years to realize goals in North Korea. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with a mild pullback seen in WTI crude futures which eased back below the USD 52.00/bbl as prices took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s near-5% surge which had been inspired by recent inventory draws as well as OPEC commentary from Saudi&rsquo;s Energy Minister Al Falih refusing to rule out future action. Elsewhere, gold remained lifted by a weaker greenback in the aftermath of the dovish Fed comments and FOMC Minutes, while copper was choppy and mostly reflected the changes in risk appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih said he would not rule out additional OPEC+ action at some point. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia December Port Hedland iron ore shipments to China 37.4mln tons vs. Prev. 32.9mln tons. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were mixed along the Treasury curve, with the 2s and 5s sectors seeing yields lower (driven by dovish Fed commentary), while 7s, 10s and 30s saw yields rise (supply, including corporate, as well as optimism on US/China trade talks). The net impact was a steepening of major curve spreads (2s5s +1bps at settlement, 2s10s +10bps, 2s30s +4.5bps, 5s30s +4bps). On the note of supply, the US sold 10-year notes in a stellar auction; although cover was in line with recent averages, the yield was the lowest at a 10s auction in nearly a year, and we saw a stop through of 0.8bps. The direct bid returned with a vengeance, taking their highest share at 10s auctions since May 2015, leaving dealers with a share below recent averages. US T-note futures (H9) settled 1 tick lower at 121-23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has tremendous Republican support on border security issues and is willing to keep government shutdown to achieve goals for however long it takes. In related news, US House Speaker Pelosi said meeting with President Trump at the White House did not last long and Senate Minority Leader Schumer said Trump walked out of the meeting with congressional leaders, while President Trump called the meeting a waste of time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House voted to approve bill to reopen Treasury Department and several other agencies without border wall money, although the White House had previously threatened to veto the bill. Elsewhere, there were reports that US Republican Senators are said to be planning on courting Democrat senators to reach a deal on border wall. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley said Congress will not grant President Trump greater powers regarding tariffs or other trade solutions. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Rosengren (Voter, Hawk) said it is possible that the Fed will need to lower interest rates but stated it is not in his view, while he had also commented that he is more optimistic than recent market volatility would suggest, that current policy is appropriately balancing risks and that the Fed be patient about any adjustments.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower as the equity rally loses steam overnight despite the gains in US, where a dovish tone from the FOMC Minutes and several Fed speakers underpinned the US majors to their longest winning streak since September. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) are subdued after sentiment in the region soured with BHP shares hit in Australia as it trades ex-dividend, while the Japanese benchmark underperforms as it takes the brunt of detrimental currency moves. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are lacklustre after the trade-related momentum began to wane and although US and China have issued separate statements in the aftermath of the trade discussions, the sides refrained from a joint statement and there was also no mention of a timeline moving forward. Furthermore, the PBoC drained another CNY 70bln from the interbank market and Chinese inflation data fell below estimates to add to the despondent tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have quietened with most major currencies holding on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains against the greenback following dovish Fed speakers and FOMC Minutes which stated that many policymakers said the Fed could be patient regarding further tightening. This has kept the DXY within proximity of the 95.00 level to the downside and EUR/USD sits near the prior day&rsquo;s highs with a 1.1500 handle. Elsewhere, high beta currencies have pulled back alongside the risk tone and with AUD also dampened by the soft Chinese inflation data, while USD/JPY is pressured to trade at a sub-108.00 level as it takes a double whammy from the impact of the dovish Fed tone on USD and safe-haven flows into JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand and which coincides with gains in T-notes in the wake of the Fed dovishness.</p>\r\n",
