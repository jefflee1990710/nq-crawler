The report stated that data suggests a moderation in Q2 GDP due to weak business investment, which appears to have decelerated sharply in 2019, and a slowdown in global trade flows. Furthermore, it added US and global tariffs have been material to the slowdown in international trade and that asset valuation remains \"somewhat elevated”.

Electronic Arts (EA) was an underperformer amid participants citing ongoing concerns for its once-praised video game Apex Legends. Semiconductors were under pressure throughout the day following Samsung posting guidance for a slowdown in Q2 as trade wars seep through to its business. The stronger dollar saw gold prices tumbling, which fed through to the miners such as Newmont (NEM), Barrick Gold (GOLD), and Kirkland Lake (KL).

Bear-flattening was the play after the data, and there was a significant paring back in the implied probabilities of a 50bps rate cut at the Fed’s July meeting – the probability has now fallen to just 0.5% from around 27% before the data, though the market is still completely priced for a 25bps cut; money markets now price 60bps of easing through the end of the year, compared to 75bps at the close of business on Thursday. Interestingly, Treasuries only marginally recovered from lows, despite equities paring back the NFP-induced slide. US T-note futures (U9) settled 25 ticks lower at 127-15.</p>",
