Alphabet (GOOGL) was supported by an upgraded to Buy from Hold at Pivotal Research, citing it as a top performing internet stock going forward.

Analysts chewed the fat over the Iran situation, and there seems to be a consensus that from the oil market's perspective, the status quo is manageable (although much of that will depend on the next moves from stakeholders). Decent services PMI data out of major markets on Monday also helped, and the upward revision to the US Markit services PMI raises hopes of a decent ISM services print on Tuesday. Additionally, the corporate supply slate is heavy, with expectations of around USD 30bln of corporate dollar supply on tap for this week, while some have suggested that it might be as high as USD 40bln.</p>",

The focus seems to be on punchy rhetoric, rather than any direct escalation of the already-tense situation. Iran has predictably stated that it will no longer abide by the 2015 nuclear deal, meaning it will no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development, the BBC reported. Meanwhile, Iraqi lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops (read: the US) to leave; the US currently has around 5,000 troops stationed in Iraq, and joint US/Iraqi coalition operations against ISIS were paused ahead of the vote; the resolution also instructs the Iraqi government to file a formal complaint at the UN against the US \"for its serious violations and breaches of Iraqi sovereignty and security.\" In response, US President Trump threatened Iraq with severe sanctions, telling reporters that \"we have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\" Focussing on Iran, Trump said the US will retaliate against Iran if it were to strike back after the killing, adding that the US had identified 52 targets, and pledged that the US could act in a \"disproportionate\" manner if Iran retaliated. Domestically, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has moved to limit Trump's ability to launch further military action against Iran, the FT reported.</p><p><strong>* US/IRAN - MONDAY DEVELOPMENTS: </strong>It has been quiet in terms of fresh news flow; US accused Russia and China of blocking UN Security Council statement on the 31st December attack on US embassy in Baghdad. The 15-member security council must agree to any statement by consensus. There has been conflicting reports on whether the US has agreed to the Iraqi lawmakers’ wishes to leave the country; a Pentagon spokesperson said they could not immediately confirm authenticity of letter which stated US was preparing to \"move out\" of Iraq, although many newswires later claimed to have verified the letter. Sky News, citing a coalition source, clarified the report, stating US-led coalition are 'to scale back in Iraq' after Soleimani killing.</p><p><strong>* US/IRAN - IMPACT ON OIL PRICES:</strong> While crude benchmarks added to gains seen in the aftermath of the killing of Iran General Soleimani, desks are sanguine that the impact can be digested by the oil market: JPMorgan sees the stress as bearable, UBS says crude prices may struggle to push on from here, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes there will be minimal impact on the US economy.

The survey-compiler said output and new order expansions quicken, but remain only modest. New orders came in at 52.7 vs flash 52.5 and November final 51.6, auguring well for the January data.&nbsp; Ahead of this week's payrolls report, the employment sub-index rose at the fastest rate since July, Markit said, while inflationary pressures were picking up. The report said the survey results are indicative of GDP rising at a relatively modest annual rate of 1.8% in December. NOTE: desks note that there has been a divergence in the Markit and ISM PMIs, of late.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE SERVICES/COMP PMI (DEC, FINAL): </strong>The final composite PMI in December was revised up to 50.9 (exp. 50.6), and the final services PMI was revised up to 52.8 (exp. 52.4). Markit said the survey signaled that the Eurozone economy remained close to stagnation at end of 2019, with December rounding off the bloc's worst quarter since 2013. \"The PMI data suggest the euro area will struggle to have grown by more than 0.1% in the closing three months of 2019,\" it said. \"At face value, the weak performance is disappointing given additional stimulus from the ECB, with the drag from the ongoing plight of the manufacturing sector a major concern,\" Markit wrote, \"however, policymakers will be encouraged by the resilient performance of the more domestically-focused service sector, where growth accelerated in December to its highest since August.\" The report also notes that business optimism about the year ahead has also improved to its best since last May, which Markit says suggests the mood among business has steadily improved in recent months. \"While the tide may be turning, downside risks to growth in the year ahead nevertheless remain notable,\" the survey compiler said, \"while US-China trade wars have eased, any escalation of trade tensions between the US and Europe will likely hit exports further. Brexit also remains a major uncertainty and is likely to continue to dampen growth in Europe.\" Nevertheless, it says that in the absence of any major adverse developments, it is expecting to see growth starting to improve as 2020 proceeds, with low inflation and easing financial conditions supporting consumer spending in particular.</p><p><strong>* UK SERVICES PMI (DEC, FINAL): </strong>The UK composite PMI in December was revised higher to 49.3 from 48.5, while the services PMI was revised up to 50.0 -- the crucial neutral line -- from 49.0. Markit noted that new orders rose at fastest pace since July 2019, there was a marginal increase in service sector employment, business optimism hit its highest since September 2018. Markit said that with manufacturing and construction output also subdued in December, the latest PMI surveys collectively signal an overall stagnation of the UK economy at the end of 2019. Markit also highlighted that the Final metrics include responses from after the UK General Election, while the Flash estimates only contained responses prior to the Election result.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H20) SETTLES USD 0.22 HIGHER AT USD 63.27; BRENT (H20) SETTLES USD 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 68.91. </strong>Crude benchmarks gapped higher at the open last night following continued worries on the US/Iran front. Reports over the weekend stated four rounds of indirect fire were launched towards the US embassy in Baghdad and explosions were heard near-by. The reports were accompanied by ongoing punchy rhetoric from both sides which provided an initial bullish catalyst for the crude complex; full analysis of price action can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-impact-on-oil-from-us-iran-iraq-tensions-jpmorgan-sees-the-stress-as-bearable-ubs-says-crude-prices-may-struggle-to-push-on-from-here-06-01-2020\">here</a>. However, amid a lack of further developments during trading hours both WTI and Brent futures pared gains gradually throughout the day and settled marginally higher, albeit still ~USD 3 higher since the US air strike on General Soleimani. Citi also highlight’s that the retreat from highs could be a function of profit taking as participants speculate the tensions will soon ease without any loss of oil production. However, it is worth noting if there is an oil shock, OPEC+ will reportedly respond to any oil emergency from the crisis in Iran, however, spare capacity is tight, according to Platts. Citi highlighted tensions have picked up between Iraq and the US given Trump’s threat of sanctions on Iraq and Iraq’s request for a withdrawal of troops from the region, although the desk concludes “while it may be tempting to guess that tensions are at a peak and that cooler heads will eventually prevail, we think it is likely that some portion of the current elevated geopolitical risk premium will remain a part of the price”. Elsewhere, the latest Reuters survey saw OPEC’s Oil Output for December at 29.50bln, down 50k BPD M/M due to lower supply emanating from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE. NOTE: this month's monthly oil reports from the EIA, OPEC, and IEA are scheduled for release on the 14th, 15th &amp; 16th. This week’s oil inventory forecasts (bbls): Crude -4.1mln, Cushing -0.661mln, Distillates +4mln and Gasoline +2.7mln.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.35% at 3246; NDX +0.62% at 8849; DJIA +0.24% at 28,703. SECTORS: Utilities +0.25%, industrials -0.03%, consumer staples +0.24%, energy +0.78%, communication services +1.3%, telecoms +1.2%, health care +0.6%, consumer discretionary +0.37%, IT +0.3%, financials -0.05%, materials -0.45%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Financials (XLF, BKX, JPM, WFC, BAC, C) and semiconductors (SOX, AMAT, SWKS, XLNX, MU) were most hit on the open amid the geopolitical induced risk off sentiment, although did come off their lows later in the session in line with other risk assets. Alphabet (GOOGL) was supported by an upgraded to Buy from Hold at Pivotal Research, citing it as a top performing internet stock going forward. Under Armour (UAA) suffered after it was reinstated with a Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan and a PT cut; the same analyst upgraded Nordstrom (JWN) to Neutral from Underweight, supporting the stock. Salesforce (CRM) firmed after being mentioned as a Top Pick at RBC Capital. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) traded higher amid its separation from Western Midstream Partners, LP (WES), where it executed several break-up agreements on Monday. AutoZone (AZO) traded in the red with gratitude to a downgrade to Neutral at Wedbush. SmileDirectClub (SDC) surged at a double-digit pace after it announced a new slew of dental products exclusively available on Walmart (WMT); it also benefited from a Buy initiation at Craig-Hallum. CrowdStrike (CRWD) made solid gains on the back of optimistic comments from its CEO George Kurtz. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) firmed following a sale and leaseback transaction of its real estate assets. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) took a haircut after reporting a surprise loss in its most recent quarter.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLES 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 129-08. </strong>The Treasury complex saw some profit-taking after gains seen at the start of the year, and amid a lack of fresh developments on the US/Iran front; the shape of the curve was little changed, while nominal yields inched up slightly. Analysts chewed the fat over the Iran situation, and there seems to be a consensus that from the oil market's perspective, the status quo is manageable (although much of that will depend on the next moves from stakeholders). Decent services PMI data out of major markets on Monday also helped, and the upward revision to the US Markit services PMI raises hopes of a decent ISM services print on Tuesday. Additionally, the corporate supply slate is heavy, with expectations of around USD 30bln of corporate dollar supply on tap for this week, while some have suggested that it might be as high as USD 40bln.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will this week auction anew 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wednesday) and a 30-year re-opening (USD 16bln, Thursday). UBS says there will be a total of USD 26bln of cash flows (ex SOMA) this week, including USD 24bln of redemptions and USD 2bln of coupons; over the next four weeks, gross supply will total USD 191bln, the bank notes.</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts say the upcoming auction has not got clear set-up from a relative value perspective, noting that it trades fair in asset swap and on the fly versus 2s and 5s. \"The sector looks rich on an outright basis versus the last two auctions, as the current 3y when-issued yield is trading below the stop-yield of previous two auctions,\" SocGen writes, \"however, currently Treasury yields are in the middle of their recent range, and given the risk of rising geopolitical tensions, we expect buyers of Treasuries to materialise.\" The bank notes that dealer holdings are relatively low in the front-end of the curve, which may support demand at the auction. The bank says it is positive on the auction, but suggests that the ISM services PMI, which is released three hours ahead of the auction, may play a role; any upside surprise may see the sector cheapen, adding to the allure of the issue, the bank writes.</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> USD traded lower to start the first full trading week of the new year; the DXY traded from highs of 96.90 overnight, finding lows in the early part of the session just above 96.50, however, some support was provided to the buck following upward revisions to the services PMI data. Gold stole the show again, printing a fresh 6-year high overnight at 1582, gapping higher by about thirty bucks at the open. Gains in the precious metal started to pare back in afternoon trade amid a rise in real rates, although is still USD 14 higher on the day. USDJPY found resistance at 108.50 in the tail end of the session after breaching December’s high of 108.43 from lows beneath the key 108.00 figure at 107.78. GBP performed well today amid upward revisions to the PMI data this morning where the services metric ticked up to the crucial 50.0 figure which saw Cable regain 1.31 to the upside from lows of 1.3065 where the cross eventually found resistance at 1.3175. EUR also firmed against the buck, amid solid PMI data which eventually took EURUSD briefly above 1.12 before paring slightly and falling back beneath the key figure, where it resides just shy of heading into the overnight session. CAD also firmer against its US rival amid broad dollar weakness and its exposure to crude prices. The Loonie proved resilient throughout the session amid a pullback in crude prices and USDCAD trades ~1.2965 figure, which desks highlight as a key support area.&nbsp; Other risk currencies, AUD and NZD, are mixed amid the tense geopolitical backdrop; AUD was slightly weaker against the buck, however, NZD outperformed its antipodean counterpart and traded marginally firmer with AUDNZD briefly falling beneath 1.04. EMFX generally traded firmer against the Dollar with outperformance seen in ZAR amid strong performance in XAU, which saw USDZAR remain above the 14.00 figure. RUB, similar to CAD, trades firmer amid its exposure to oil prices, however the Ruble also proved resilient despite a pullback in crude prices today, although crude still trades ~USD 3 higher prior to the air strike.&nbsp; TRY traded flat against the greenback to start the week and remains beneath the 6.00 handle despite reports over the weekend that Turkish Banks are selling Dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Analysts chewed the fat over the Iran situation, and there seems to be a consensus that from the oil market's perspective, the status quo is manageable (although much of that will depend on the next moves from stakeholders). Decent services PMI data out of major markets on Monday also helped, and the upward revision to the US Markit services PMI raises hopes of a decent ISM services print on Tuesday. Additionally, the corporate supply slate is heavy, with expectations of around USD 30bln of corporate dollar supply on tap for this week, while some have suggested that it might be as high as USD 40bln.</li><li><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will this week auction anew 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wednesday) and a 30-year re-opening (USD 16bln, Thursday). UBS says there will be a total of USD 26bln of cash flows (ex SOMA) this week, including USD 24bln of redemptions and USD 2bln of coupons; over the next four weeks, gross supply will total USD 191bln, the bank notes.</li><li><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts say the upcoming auction has not got clear set-up from a relative value perspective, noting that it trades fair in asset swap and on the fly versus 2s and 5s. \"The sector looks rich on an outright basis versus the last two auctions, as the current 3y when-issued yield is trading below the stop-yield of previous two auctions,\" SocGen writes, \"however, currently Treasury yields are in the middle of their recent range, and given the risk of rising geopolitical tensions, we expect buyers of Treasuries to materialise.\" The bank notes that dealer holdings are relatively low in the front-end of the curve, which may support demand at the auction. The bank says it is positive on the auction, but suggests that the ISM services PMI, which is released three hours ahead of the auction, may play a role; any upside surprise may see the sector cheapen, adding to the allure of the issue, the bank writes.</li></ul>",

Reports over the weekend stated four rounds of indirect fire were launched towards the US embassy in Baghdad and explosions were heard near-by. The reports were accompanied by ongoing punchy rhetoric from both sides which provided an initial bullish catalyst for the crude complex; full analysis of price action can be found <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-impact-on-oil-from-us-iran-iraq-tensions-jpmorgan-sees-the-stress-as-bearable-ubs-says-crude-prices-may-struggle-to-push-on-from-here-06-01-2020\">here</a>. However, amid a lack of further developments during trading hours both WTI and Brent futures pared gains gradually throughout the day and settled marginally higher, albeit still ~USD 3 higher since the US air strike on General Soleimani. Citi also highlight’s that the retreat from highs could be a function of profit taking as participants speculate the tensions will soon ease without any loss of oil production. However, it is worth noting if there is an oil shock, OPEC+ will reportedly respond to any oil emergency from the crisis in Iran, however, spare capacity is tight, according to Platts. Citi highlighted tensions have picked up between Iraq and the US given Trump’s threat of sanctions on Iraq and Iraq’s request for a withdrawal of troops from the region, although the desk concludes “while it may be tempting to guess that tensions are at a peak and that cooler heads will eventually prevail, we think it is likely that some portion of the current elevated geopolitical risk premium will remain a part of the price”. Elsewhere, the latest Reuters survey saw OPEC’s Oil Output for December at 29.50bln, down 50k BPD M/M due to lower supply emanating from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE. NOTE: this month's monthly oil reports from the EIA, OPEC, and IEA are scheduled for release on the 14th, 15th &amp; 16th. This week’s oil inventory forecasts (bbls): Crude -4.1mln, Cushing -0.661mln, Distillates +4mln and Gasoline +2.7mln.&nbsp;</p>",

However, the Buck remains mixed at best vs G10 peers and softer against most EM counterparts awaiting the next salvo in the hostile US-Iran situation after more threats and counterthreats between Washington and Tehran.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/CAD</strong></p><p>All retaining gains vs their US rival, but to varying degrees and down from peaks set when final EU services PMIs and the Eurozone Sentix index broadly beat consensus. Cable is holding comfortably above 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp is back down near the base of a 0.8545-0.8500 band as Eur/Usd drifts back from a brief and minor foray over 1.1200, while the Franc pivots 0.9700 and Loonie meanders between 1.2990-65 in wake of mixed Canadian PPI metrics and another geopolitically motivated rise in crude prices.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona also found some support from the aforementioned higher oil/supply premium, with Eur/Nok reversing an early risk averse rally towards 9.8850 and now back below 9.8500 in contrast to Eur/Sek that seems to be consolidating above 10.5000.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major laggards, as Nzd/Usd failed to advance on 0.6680 and Usd/Jpy rebounded through 108.00 following another false break under the big figure to notch a higher high near 108.40. Technically, a close above December’s 108.43 low could be compelling, while Aud/Usd looks destined to retreat further if 0.6950 cannot be reclaimed and sustained.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although petro-currencies and the commodity bloc evaded risk-off positioning in the main due to strength in the underlying, like the Rand amidst Gold’s rush through last year’s peak and the Rouble on Brent’s buoyancy, specs kept the Lira in check despite reports of Turkish banks selling Dollars to possibly, if not probably defend the psychological 6.0000 level.</p>",

An update on the Iranian situation is available in the Commodity section below. Indices are all in negative territory at present in Europe, with US futures painting a similar picture as well; price action this morning has seen the Dax and Stoxx 50 futures test key levels to the downside, with the Dax having convincingly given up the 13000 mark and the Stoxx 50 testing the 3700 handle on multiple occasions. In terms of sectors, it’s a similar story to Friday, with all sectors in negative territory aside from Energy which continues to benefit from the inflated oil prices; which is, in turn, assisting oil names such as BP (+1.8%) and Shell (+1.2%), and is helping to stem some of the FTSE 100’s losses&nbsp; - although, the bourse is firmly in negative territory. Turning to other notable movers, at the other end of the spectrum from the outperforming oil names, flight names such as Ryanair (-4.4%) and Air France (-3.8%) are weighed on by the crude market. Elsewhere, Metro AG (-5.0%) are suffering after a downgraded at JP Morgan, while ASML (-3.5%) are afflicted on reports that US President Trump’s Administration implemented a campaign to prevent the sale of the Co’s technology to China; do note, this reportedly began in 2018 and as such the significance and current situation may well have changed given the US-China trade war.</p><p>Boeing (BA) - Co. are reportedly evaluating plans to increase debt to boost finances which have been afflicted by the 737 Max's grounding; Co. are also considering deferring some capital expenditure, and reducing R&amp;D in an attempt to preserve cash., WSJ . FAA and Boeing (BA) have confirmed that they are currently reviewing a wiring issue on the 737 Max, which has the potential to cause the craft to short-circuit; FAA has flagged the wiring issue as being potentially catastrophic. FAA are expected to announce a formal decision in February regarding whether pilots will be required to undertake compulsory simulator training prior to flying the 737 Max. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>GBP/EUR - The Pound was already benefiting from broad Dollar weakness amidst escalating US-Iran tensions and in wake of last Friday’s dire manufacturing ISM, but Cable derived some independent impetus from the final UK services PMI that beat consensus in contrast to manufacturing and construction, albeit only reclaiming the 50 level on post-GE relief that did not factor in the preliminary survey. Cable is hovering just shy of 1.3175 compared to lows circa 1.3064, and Eur/Gbp threatening 0.8500 bids even though the single currency also gleaned encouragement from largely firmer than forecast or flash Eurozone services PMIs and a more upbeat than anticipated Sentix index. Indeed, Eur/Usd is inching towards 1.1200 vs sub-1.1160 and further from very early 2020 lows under 1.1125.</p><p>CHF/CAD/NZD/AUD/JPY - Also firmer against the Greenback, as the DXY slips towards 96.500, with the Franc crossing 0.9700, Loonie eying 1.2950, Kiwi hovering around 0.6675 and Aussie back above 0.6950. However, the Yen is still finding 108.00 too tough to breach as Japanese markets return from their long New Year holiday and contacts suspect a major player is propping the headline pair.</p><p>NOK/SEK - More divergence between the Scandi Crowns, as Eur/Nok repels risk-off rebounds ahead of 9.9000 with the aid of oil’s ongoing rally, but Eur/Sek struggles to cap advances beyond 10.5000 and Nok/Sek extends its advance towards 1.0700 after breaking strong chart resistance below 1.0500.</p><p>EM - Risk aversion has prevented many regional currencies from taking advantage of general Buck underperformance, but the Rouble is also getting a boost from Brent and Rand has managed to overcome more Eskom power issues to bounce back above 14.3000 on what appears to be mainly technical grounds.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Having failed to build on or even retest initial Liffe peaks, <strong>UK bonds</strong> have subsequently erased all and more of their best gains to a 132.00 intraday low (-23 ticks vs +39 ticks) on the back of an unexpected recovery in the services PMI to the 50 break-even level, and the gradual reversal seems to have been contagious as <strong>Bunds </strong>also retrace more ground to 172.13 (+1 tick vs +48 ticks). However, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> remain on a more even keel ahead of the final Markit PMIs and mindful of the rather bleak manufacturing ISM not to mention the deteriorating situation between the US and Iran.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> prices remain elevated on Iranian-US tensions, with prices higher by just shy of a USD 1.0/bbl at present; as crude prices have drifted off of their overnight highs as sentiment continues to deteriorate but the ferocity of newsflow has reduced as mourning proceedings are underway in the Middle-East for Soleimani. Weekend reports highlight that Iran has finalised a retreat from the nuclear deal, and will not be complying with any of the restrictions set out within this; additionally, Iraqi parliament has voted to begin developing plans to end the presence of US troops in the country. For reference, an analysis piece which outlines the impact on oil prices from the ongoing situation is available on the Newsquawk headline feed. The key views are JP Morgan believing that the stress on oil supply will be bearable, looking ahead focus is on whether the situation will disrupt supplies with UBS noting, at a minimum, US assets in the area are at risk – as is the broad infrastructure for oil supply in the region. Separately, ING posit that any substantial increase in crude prices could see US President Trump authorise use of the SPR, which currently has around 635mln barrels of supply. For reference, in 2018 the US consumed on average 20.5mln BPD, given this consumption rate this implies self-sufficiency for the US of roughly one month; excluding additional US production which last week stood at 12.9mln barrels and would significantly extended such a period of self-sufficiency. In terms of metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> is well supported on the aforementioned tensions with the precious metal having printed a high just over USD 1587/oz overnight, which is a 6-year high for the safe haven. Price action picked up once the USD 1557/oz mark was surpassed, with contacts noting a number of stops were likely present around this figure. Additionally, the yellow metal will be gleaning support from a softer dollar this morning, with the DXY having printed multiple fresh session lows throughout the session.</p><p>SocGen forecast Brent prices averaging USD 56.25/bbl in 2020; retain their bullish forecast for Gold with prices to average USD 1575/oz in Q3 2020.

An update on the Iranian situation is available in the Commodity section below. Indices are all in negative territory at present in Europe, with US futures painting a similar picture as well; price action this morning has seen the Dax and Stoxx 50 futures test key levels to the downside, with the Dax having convincingly given up the 13000 mark and the Stoxx 50 testing the 3700 handle on multiple occasions. In terms of sectors, it’s a similar story to Friday, with all sectors in negative territory aside from Energy which continues to benefit from the inflated oil prices; which is, in turn, assisting oil names such as BP (+1.8%) and Shell (+1.2%), and is helping to stem some of the FTSE 100’s losses&nbsp; - although, the bourse is firmly in negative territory. Turning to other notable movers, at the other end of the spectrum from the outperforming oil names, flight names such as Ryanair (-4.4%) and Air France (-3.8%) are weighed on by the crude market. Elsewhere, Metro AG (-5.0%) are suffering after a downgraded at JP Morgan, while ASML (-3.5%) are afflicted on reports that US President Trump’s Administration implemented a campaign to prevent the sale of the Co’s technology to China; do note, this reportedly began in 2018 and as such the significance and current situation may well have changed given the US-China trade war.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP/EUR - The Pound was already benefiting from broad Dollar weakness amidst escalating US-Iran tensions and in wake of last Friday’s dire manufacturing ISM, but Cable derived some independent impetus from the final UK services PMI that beat consensus in contrast to manufacturing and construction, albeit only reclaiming the 50 level on post-GE relief that did not factor in the preliminary survey. Cable is hovering just shy of 1.3175 compared to lows circa 1.3064, and Eur/Gbp threatening 0.8500 bids even though the single currency also gleaned encouragement from largely firmer than forecast or flash Eurozone services PMIs and a more upbeat than anticipated Sentix index. Indeed, Eur/Usd is inching towards 1.1200 vs sub-1.1160 and further from very early 2020 lows under 1.1125.</p><p>CHF/CAD/NZD/AUD/JPY - Also firmer against the Greenback, as the DXY slips towards 96.500, with the Franc crossing 0.9700, Loonie eying 1.2950, Kiwi hovering around 0.6675 and Aussie back above 0.6950. However, the Yen is still finding 108.00 too tough to breach as Japanese markets return from their long New Year holiday and contacts suspect a major player is propping the headline pair.</p><p>NOK/SEK - More divergence between the Scandi Crowns, as Eur/Nok repels risk-off rebounds ahead of 9.9000 with the aid of oil’s ongoing rally, but Eur/Sek struggles to cap advances beyond 10.5000 and Nok/Sek extends its advance towards 1.0700 after breaking strong chart resistance below 1.0500.</p><p>EM - Risk aversion has prevented many regional currencies from taking advantage of general Buck underperformance, but the Rouble is also getting a boost from Brent and Rand has managed to overcome more Eskom power issues to bounce back above 14.3000 on what appears to be mainly technical grounds.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Having failed to build on or even retest initial Liffe peaks, <strong>UK bonds</strong> have subsequently erased all and more of their best gains to a 132.00 intraday low (-23 ticks vs +39 ticks) on the back of an unexpected recovery in the services PMI to the 50 break-even level, and the gradual reversal seems to have been contagious as <strong>Bunds </strong>also retrace more ground to 172.13 (+1 tick vs +48 ticks). However, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> remain on a more even keel ahead of the final Markit PMIs and mindful of the rather bleak manufacturing ISM not to mention the deteriorating situation between the US and Iran.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> prices remain elevated on Iranian-US tensions, with prices higher by just shy of a USD 1.0/bbl at present; as crude prices have drifted off of their overnight highs as sentiment continues to deteriorate but the ferocity of newsflow has reduced as mourning proceedings are underway in the Middle-East for Soleimani. Weekend reports highlight that Iran has finalised a retreat from the nuclear deal, and will not be complying with any of the restrictions set out within this; additionally, Iraqi parliament has voted to begin developing plans to end the presence of US troops in the country. For reference, an analysis piece which outlines the impact on oil prices from the ongoing situation is <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-impact-on-oil-from-us-iran-iraq-tensions-jpmorgan-sees-the-stress-as-bearable-ubs-says-crude-prices-may-struggle-to-push-on-from-here-06-01-2020\">available on the Newsquawk headline feed</a>. The key views are JP Morgan believing that the stress on oil supply will be bearable, looking ahead focus is on whether the situation will disrupt supplies with UBS noting, at a minimum, US assets in the area are at risk – as is the broad infrastructure for oil supply in the region. Separately, ING posit that any substantial increase in crude prices could see US President Trump authorise use of the SPR, which currently has around 635mln barrels of supply. For reference, in 2018 the US consumed on average 20.5mln BPD, given this consumption rate this implies self-sufficiency for the US of roughly one month; excluding additional US production which last week stood at 12.9mln barrels and would significantly extended such a period of self-sufficiency. In terms of metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> is well supported on the aforementioned tensions with the precious metal having printed a high just over USD 1587/oz overnight, which is a 6-year high for the safe haven. Price action picked up once the USD 1557/oz mark was surpassed, with contacts noting a number of stops were likely present around this figure. Additionally, the yellow metal will be gleaning support from a softer dollar this morning, with the DXY having printed multiple fresh session lows throughout the session.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Brent added USD 2.35 on Friday (around 3%), and is up ~USD 1.40 on Monday morning. The impact has been positive for the oil complex, but not for cyclicals; JPM sees oil supply stress as bearable.</li><li>The key for oil prices depends on the market and investor positioning; the tighter the market and the shorter the positioning, the greater the scope for large and persistent price gains. Currently, positioning is long, and the and the market has tightened after OPEC+ deal (though still in a slight deficit of 200k BPD on a 12m rolling basis, JPMorgan estimates). The latest CFTC commitment of trades data does not capture the escalation at the end of last week (the data runs through the week ending Tuesday) - it will be next week's data that shows how specs adjusted positions in response.</li><li>Key question: will the situation escalate into supply disruption? At the very minimum, UBS says the latest developments put US assets in the Middle East at risk, and also increase the risk of disruptions to oil supply in the region - be it Iran disrupting oil flows via the Strait of Hormuz (where around one-fifth of global oil supply passes through the strait on a daily basis), or attacking energy infrastructure of US allies in the region.</li><li>JPM says the last year’s change in oil prices (+11%) wouldn’t register as an income shock, so even a supply-driven move into the USD 70s seems manageable for the growth outlook. Says oil appears close to fair value based on supply/demand balance; and the bank estimates that every 10-12% change from here would represent a premium for a tightening of about 500kbd.</li><li>Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that given the 40% increase in US oil production since 2014 the net boost to US economic growth of a sustained jump in oil prices has risen. This goes against the historical perception that higher oil prices are detrimental to the US economy (consumption impact) and is something that has been noted by the Fed. However, PM suggests that the market is yet to catch up to this view point and could, counter-intuitively pressure policymakers into lowering rates.</li><li>Demand expectations are fragile when the global economy is only just starting to bottom, which will offset some of the supply premium that prices deserve, JPM argues. So if spike risk persists but might be contained, it says that portfolio strategy should focus on energy exposure that doesn’t strictly require higher prices to outperform, such as a combination of value trades (overweight US &amp; European Energy Equities) and carry trades (US HY Energy Credit, RUB vs USD).</li><li>Meanwhile, UBS thinks it is too early to fade the move in European Oils, especially given the level of underweights in the sector. Having said that, its sales strategists note that given that Brent is now trading above USD 70/bbl, there should be some flexibility creeping back into the oil market (UBS estimates the market currently has around 3mln BPD of spare capacity) and that's even before US shale producers respond.</li><li>On crude itself, UBS says that ultimately, prices may struggle to push on from here in the absence of any further significant escalation (actual disruption to Saudi supply, for example), but clearly the geo-political premium in oil prices was understated, and will now be reflected moving forward.</li></ul>",

Finally, <strong>copper</strong> prices posted a modest rebound after Friday’s hefty losses as a tentative Phase One deal signing date provided the red metal with some relief from the recent sentiment-driven downside.</p><p>Baker Hughes US Rig Count (3th Jan): Oil -7 at 670, natural gas -2 at 123 and total rigs -9 at 796 rigs. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FOMC MINUTES</strong></p><p><strong>Minutes from the December meeting stated that the current stance \"likely to remain appropriate for a time\", and minutes do not outline a contrary view</strong>. A few raised concerns that low rates for a long time could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector whilst many saw risks to the outlook as tilted to the downside, but some risks had eased in recent months. Policymakers agreed that they would not reaffirm existing statement on long-run goals in the January statement, but would revisit these in mid-2020. The minutes also stated that the Fed will discuss SRF in upcoming meetings and technical adjustments to IOER may be seen ahead.</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 24+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-12+. </strong>The TPLEX caught a bid on the step-up in geopolitical risk, which saw a flight-to-quality across macro markets, which became more acute throughout the session (10s yields down by around 9bps). The curve bull-flattened, particularly in the front to belly, with the 2s10s narrowing by around 4bps at settlement, and 2s30s narrowing by around 3bps at settlement (taking this week’s 2s30s narrowing to around 8bps). The complex shrugged-off grim ISM as well as the Fed’s December’s meeting minutes, despite the former’s headline falling to the lowest since 2009. Traders also noted that it was interesting that, while equities rebounded off of lows from the late European morning onwards, the Treasury space has not done so, with the T-Note only slightly off highs at settlement.</p><p><strong>White House Trade Advisor Navarro said there will be an anchor of growth closer to 3% in 2020.

(WSJ)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Kaplan (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said Fed should not make any moves with the fed funds rate. it is too early to guess if a rate hike or cut comes next. He expects 2020 to deliver solid growth and said he would be willing to allow inflation to run above target for a short amount of time. Kaplan sees US sees growth between 2.00-2.25% this year, though he noted ongoing uncertainties on trade, as well as manufacturing difficulties. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawkish)</strong> said he wants to see the effects of the insurance rate cuts before taking further action. Fed is focused on providing liquidity during pressure days in the repo market; April 15th could serve as such a date; USD 1.5trln in reserves is a reasonable amount while longer term solutions are worked on.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets kick the week off mostly in the red following downside seen on Wall Street on Friday, as US-Iran developments and dismal US ISM metrics weighed on sentiment. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is led lower by a bulk of its constituents in negative territory including its largest weighed financial sector, albeit losses are somewhat cushioned by gold miners and energy names as prices in the complexes rose amid the escalating geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) underperforms given the recent safe-haven demand in the JPY and as Japanese participants had the first chance to react to the Middle Eastern developments after their extended New Year break. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.8%) opened modestly in negative territory but extended losses as heavyweight financial names accelerated downside with traders attributing the closures of local branches due to the protests, although energy names again benefit from the surge in crude prices with CNOOC notching gains in excess of 3%. Finally, Shanghai Comp (+0.1%) oscillates between gains and losses as the overall risk aversion in the market was balanced by the PBoC’s RRR cut going into effect today, releasing over CNY 800bln of long-term funds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, DXY remains within a relatively tight range below the 97.00 mark and holds onto a bulk of the losses seen on Friday and with little by way of a reaction seen at the release of the FOMC Minutes. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are also uneventful amid a lack of overnight catalysts, with the former trading sideways above 1.1150 ahead of its 50 WMA seen at 1.1172 with around EUR 780mln of options expiring at strike 1.1170. Meanwhile, Cable trades on either side of 1.3075 having briefly dipped below its 200 WMA at 1.3070. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially gapped lower to sub-108.00 levels as the intensifying geopolitical landscape prompted safe-haven demand. That said, the pair later recouped some losses amid a lack of news-flow and temporarily regained 108-status ahead of a sizable USD 1.2bln of options expiries at 108.50. Antipodeans remain choppy, but within narrow parameters with AUD/USD probing the 0.6950 level throughout most of the session whilst its Kiwi counterpart stayed afloat above 0.6650 having tested the level on multiple occasions.</p>",
