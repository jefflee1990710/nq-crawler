There were further comments directly from President Trump that there was no decision yet made on rolling back tariffs which saw a kneejerk risk-off reaction across major asset classes. The greenback moved higher, with desks noting a catch up to yields given the week’s bear-steepening across the Treasury curve, where the 10-year yield now lies close to the 2.00% figure. The dollar strength weighed on its crosses, namely gold and Yen, and particularly CAD, which caught a double barrel blow from its disappointing October jobs data. Equity sectors were mixed, Disney (DIS) earnings supported the telecoms sector, whilst Duke (D) weighed on utilities; a late rally in oil prices (likely a factor of book squaring ahead of the weekend) failed to alleviate the energy sector from its losses, however.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>US President Trump said himself on Friday that he has not yet agreed to roll back the tariffs on China, saying that China would like him to do so and wants to make a deal with the US; he added that the deal would be signed in the US (contrary to reports earlier in the week of it to be signed elsewhere). Politico reported a source citing Trump as saying he wants the deal signed this month. Other reports cited Trump as saying he would not “fully” roll back China tariffs. The White House spokesperson commented that the US is optimistic on a deal, saying if one is reached, then “some” tariffs could be lifted. These reports were in-fitting with previous sources reports, putting caution on the Chinese Commerce Ministry saying that the two countries had agreed to cancel tariffs on Thursday, nonetheless, the comment directly from the US President saw another bout of risk off in markets. By Trump saying he had not “YET” agreed to a tariff roll back, indicated that it was still certainly a possibility, a caveat which China Global Times Editor Hu Xijin highlighted. FBN’s Lawrence reported earlier in the session that White House Trade Advisor Navarro (noted policy hawk) said that the US is willing to postpone the December 15th tariffs and that would be it for a Phase One deal, so that the US has more wiggle room for negotiations in Phase 2 and Phase 3 deals. Although Navarro is considered a China hawk, his comments are not in complete contradiction with that of the Chinese side, who said the magnitude of cancellations can be negotiated and will depend on the Phase One content. Note that on Thursday the market sold off on reports that there was fierce opposition to tariff roll backs within the White House, with eyes on Navarro as a source of said opposition. Politico sources also reported Trump as saying he remained confident that some kind of deal gets done, but there is still some work needed and internal opponents of going soft on tariffs, adding that the White House made a conscious decision not to push back on the reports out of China as they viewed them as generally positive and favourable.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN JOBS DATA: </strong>Canadian employment data for the month of October disappointed on Friday; the number of jobs in the economy fell by -1.8k, against expectations for a 15.9k rise, driven by a 16.1k fall in full-time unemployment (vs a 14.3k rise in part-time employment). Unemployment printed in line with expectations at 5.5%, as did participation rate at 65.7%. Wage growth was a bright spot, with wages expanding at a solid 4.4%, slightly higher than the 4.25% rate of increase seen in September. Weakness was particularly strong in the Manufacturing and Construction industries, losing 23.1k and 21.3k jobs respectively, while Public Sector employment rose 28.7k, although “we have to consider that some of these jobs were related to temporary hiring because of the federal election” cautions ING, adding “there is a strong chance they will unwind”. The bank goes on to point out that private sector employment has now declined in four out of the last six months, which, despite strong wage growth and low unemployment, is a sign that the labour market could be peaking.</p><p>* <strong>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN (NOV.): </strong>Headline figure came in at 95.7, missing the expected 95.9, but a rise from the prior 95.5<strong>. </strong>Capital Economics highlight that the figure is below its yearly highs, but well above the long-run average, which lends support to their view that consumption growth will continue to slow only gradually. The expectations component rose to 85.9 from 84.2, whilst beating the expected 84.9, whilst the conditions component dragged on the headline, falling to 110.9 from 113.2, undercutting the expectations for 112.5. Cap Eco note the rise in expectations is hardly surprising given the new ATHs in US equity bourses and trade developments, with the decline in conditions supporting the thesis of a slowdown in employment growth, but caveats that labour market conditions “clearly remain fairly strong.” The short-term inflation expectations remained unchanged at 2.5%, whilst the long-run figure rose to 2.4% from 2.3%, providing some market (and Fed) relief of deflationary pressures, albeit slim.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.09 HIGHER AT USD 57.24/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.22 HIGHER AT USD 62.51/BBL</strong>. Crude markets settled lower on Friday morning, as the market’s wider risk on rally seemingly paused for breath. As European traders arrived at their desks, crude prices came under pressure, with some desks pointing to mixed Chinese data; China’s crude imports rose 11.5% in October Y/Y but car sales shrank for a 16th consecutive month. Moreover, another decline in exports has “compounded fears of a Chinese economic slowdown”, says PVM. Regardless, after the US open, the direction reversed, and crude strengthened into the close settling higher; some desks suggested end-of-week book squaring as a possible explanation. In terms of price levels; WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 futures fell as low as USD 55.76/bbl and USD 60.66/bbl on the day, before both powered back into the green in lack of fundamental news heading to levels just shy of yesterday’s highs at USD 57.86/bbl and USD 62.87/bbl. Crude specific news flow again took a back seat; OPEC October output rose by 1.26 mbpd to 29.71 mbpd compared to September, according to a Platts survey. Elsewhere, Alberta’s Government said oil producers can drill from conventional wells without limits as of today, although curtailment orders remain in effect on existing producers' conventional oil wells. Separately, PBF’s Toledo refinery (170k BDP) is expecting to carry out maintenance on several units in Q1 2020. The Baker Hughes US rig count showed oil rigs -7 at 684, marking the third consecutive week of cuts, nat. gas rigs unchanged at 130 and total rigs -5 at 817.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED UNCHANGED AT 128-12+. </strong>A lack of conviction in risk appetite was evident in the TPLEX which settled little changed. The T-Note was offered through the European session before reversing course in the latter end of the day, triggered by US President Trump saying he had not yet decided whether to roll back China tariffs. More broadly, looking at the week, the TPLEX has seen significant amount of selling, with yields at levels not seen since July, off their lows in late-August/early-September. Given the reported progress in US-China trade, Treasury refunding, ramped up corporate issuance and a Fed now (presumably) on pause, the selling pressure on the TPLEX is of little surprise in this first week of November.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3093, NASDAQ-100 0.4% at 8256, Dow Jones 0% at 27681</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0%, Consumer Staples 0%, Energy -0.8%, Financials 0%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 0.2%, Information Technology 0.6%, Materials 0.4%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities -0.4%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> McDonald’s (MCD) shares were supported on an upgrade to Buy from Neutral at Longbow; the analyst noted the Co. is in good hands following the appointment of its new CEO Chris Kempczinski, as he has played an integral role alongside the former CEO Easterbrook in driving company performance. AbbVie (ABBV) performed well; the Co. submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for its Imbruvica for treatment of patients younger than 70 years old with small or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Separately, the Co. will price USD 28bln in supply next week for its Allergan (AGN) acquisition. Alibaba (BABA) made decent strides on reports that it is planning to launch its Hong Kong IPO in the last week of November, according to sources; the Co. hopes to raise USD 15bln in its offering. HP (HPQ) was under pressure on reports that its board is not convinced that a sale to Xerox (XRX) is the right move. DuPont de Nemours Inc (DD) moved lower in choppy trade, on reports that it is considering divesting is transportation business. Albemarle (ALB) was under pressure after being downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan, who noted the growth rate for global electric vehicles is slowing whilst lithium supply is picking up, leading its analysts to believe the Co.’s long term contracts are potentially to be renegotiated downwards. Elsewhere in notable downgrades, Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF) was pressured on a downgrade to hold from buy at Jefferies, citing limited scope for a third-party acquisition bid, although LVMH (MC FP) is reportedly willing to up its offer from USD 120/share. United Rentals (URI) performed well after being upgraded to Conviction buy at Goldman Sachs, while Cummins (CMI) was supported by an upgrade at Evercore ISI. Boeing (BA) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) saw pressure as it was announced LUV would be pushing back the flight schedule for BA’s 737 Max jet to March; from February previously. LUV also announced due to the delay it is unable to provide Q120 ASM guidance at this time. AstraZeneca (AZN) caught a bid during trade as its phase 3 Farxiga trial met its primary efficacy endpoint. Also of note, unconfirmed source reports noted takeover chatter for PayPal (PYPL), with Mastercard (MA) touted as a potential suitor with a USD 135/shr offer.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Disney (DIS) advanced on a solid EPS beat, whilst the entertainment Co. also announced a deal with Amazon (AMZN) for the Disney+ streaming service. Monster (MNST) was bid after reporting EPS and revenue beats whilst announcing a USD 500mln share repurchase programme. Booking Holdings (BKNG) posted a solid EPS beat and subsequently moved higher, with Expedia (EXPE) moving higher in tandem. On the flip side; Gap (GPS) fell after it’s cutting its outlook, while its CEO also stepped down. Moreover, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was pressured after providing poor Q4 guidance. Utilities underperformed, despite the tentative feel to trade today, due to poor earnings from Duke Energy (DUK) and Ameren (AEE). Mettler Toledo (MTD) fell after its FY19 EPS view disappointed.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is riding high against all bar a select few rival currencies on a mixture of positive/supportive factors, including an upbeat US non-manufacturing ISM survey, heightened prospects that Phase 1 of the trade deal with China could be in the offing and last but not least more pronounced UST yield curve steepening (of the bearish kind). Indeed, the DXY looks primed to extend its recovery from post-Fed and initial NFP lows beyond 98.000 through 98.300 and towards 98.500 if Fib resistance around 98.387 is breached (50% retracement of the drop from October/ytd peak to this month’s low to date).</p><p><strong>YUAN</strong></p><p>Overriding Dollar strength has pushed the Cnh and Cny back off best levels, but both remain around the psychological 7.0000 level after the PBoC set the onshore mid-point below the symbolic round number for the first time in more than 3 months overnight. However, the primary catalyst for the Renminbi rally has been the aforementioned constructive US-China trade developments and mutual agreement to simultaneously lift tariffs in stages and equal measures as each part of the multi-part accord is signed off. On that note, several question marks remain and following reports that some in the White House are still not on board with making concessions, late breaking headlines quoting President Trump claim he has not agreed to Chinese demands for the removal of all levies.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has retreated further from best levels despite more better than expected UK PMIs and a services headline print that rebounded to 50.0, with Cable down around weekly lows within a 1.2795-1.2950 range and Eur/Gbp vice-versa between 0.8660-0.8585 parameters. For once, political and Brexit uncertainty or bad news did not undermine/underpin Sterling as the election campaigns dominated domestic headlines and the only HoC vote of note was to choose a new Speaker. Instead, BoE ‘super’ Thursday turned out to be quite the opposite as 2 MPC voters dissented for a 25 bp ease, while the minutes and November MPR were both nuanced towards the dovish side. Note also, looming Moody’s ratings review could err on the side of an outlook downgrade.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the seemingly constructive (on balance) US-China Phase 1 trade vibe noted above, the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie are all ending the week weaker against their US counterpart, and at or near fresh wtd troughs. Aud/Usd is only just holding above 0.6850 after the RBA’s SOMP sounded somewhat less confident about a gentle economic turning point than the official post-policy meeting statement given a GDP forecast downgrade and discussion about non-standard stimulus. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd has lost sight of 0.6400 in wake moderately sub-consensus NZ Q3 jobs data that might warrant some acknowledgment from the RBNZ next week, and in similar vein Usd/Cad has responded to Canada’s labour report revealing a surprise decline in headline payrolls that would have been even worse without a rise in temps and could unnerve the BoC after last week’s more downbeat outlook/assessment. Usd/Cad currently above 1.3200 vs circa 1.3115 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Also flagging vs the Buck over the course of the week and ending close to worst levels on safe-haven unwinding and relative yield/Central Bank policy dynamics. Eur/Usd has recoiled from 1.1175 towards 1.1000 through a series of technical support levels and with the single currency perhaps factoring in some Spanish political premium ahead of the weekend election, while Usd/Chf is hovering just under 0.9975 vs almost 0.9850 after more dovish than usual SNB remarks from President Jordan and another increase in Swiss sight deposits. The BoJ has also been underlining its accommodation and Government reinforcing fiscal stimulus via PM Abe’s call for a supplementary budget, but the Yen retaining an element of underlying demand unlike Gold that has broken well below the Usd1500/oz threshold within a 109.48-108.20 approx band, perhaps on the premise that US-China trade hype is too euphoric or exuberant.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Plenty of big moves, individual drivers and country specific impulses behind them, but of those the Rand, Real and Lira have grabbed their fair share of headlines if not more. Eskom power issues and reduced capacity have blighted the Zar that started the week brightly on post-Moody’s SA ratings relief, while the Brl has been literally undermined by the underwhelming interest in Brazil’s TOR auction of oil site blocks as some lots received no bids at all and the biggest one on offer only a few outside Petrobras that already owns 90% of the field. Elsewhere, softer than forecast Turkish CPI ramped up the pressure on the CBRT to reverse even more monetary tightening, but the Try was also rattled by more sabre-rattling from President Erdogan on the Syria front and complaints about the US not upholding its end of the peace pact. Moreover, the Foreign Ministry announced that the 2nd part of Russian S-400 missile system parts are still planned to arrive in Turkey next year.</p>",

As European traders arrived at their desks, crude prices came under pressure, with some desks pointing to mixed Chinese data; China’s crude imports rose 11.5% in October Y/Y but car sales shrank for a 16th consecutive month. Moreover, another decline in exports has “compounded fears of a Chinese economic slowdown”, says PVM. Regardless, after the US open, the direction reversed, and crude strengthened into the close settling higher; some desks suggested end-of-week book squaring as a possible explanation. In terms of price levels; WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 futures fell as low as USD 55.76/bbl and USD 60.66/bbl on the day, before both powered back into the green in lack of fundamental news heading to levels just shy of yesterday’s highs at USD 57.86/bbl and USD 62.87/bbl. Crude specific news flow again took the back seat; OPEC October output rose by 1.26 mbpd to 29.71 mbpd compared to September, according to a Platts survey. Elsewhere, Alberta’s Government said oil producers can drill from conventional wells without limits as of today, although curtailment orders remain in effect on existing producers' conventional oil wells. Separately, PBF’s Toledo refinery (170k BDP) is expecting to carry out maintenance on several units in Q1 2020. The Baker Hughes US rig count showed oil rigs -7 at 684, marking the third consecutive week of cuts, nat. gas rigs unchanged at 130 and total rigs -5 at 817.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Dollar bulled up as US Treasury curve bear steepens",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is riding high against all bar a select few rival currencies on a mixture of positive/supportive factors, including an upbeat US non-manufacturing ISM survey, heightened prospects that Phase 1 of the trade deal with China could be in the offing and last but not least more pronounced UST yield curve steepening (of the bearish kind). Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>looks primed to extend its recovery from post-Fed and initial NFP lows beyond 98.000 through 98.300 and towards 98.500 if Fib resistance around 98.387 is breached (50% retracement of the drop from October/ytd peak to this month’s low to date).</p><p><strong>YUAN</strong></p><p>Overriding Dollar strength has pushed the Cnh and Cny back off best levels, but both remain around the psychological 7.0000 level after the PBoC set the onshore mid-point below the symbolic round number for the first time in more than 3 months overnight. However, the primary catalyst for the Renminbi rally has been the aforementioned constructive US-China trade developments and mutual agreement to simultaneously lift tariffs in stages and equal measures as each part of the multi-part accord is signed off. On that note, several question marks remain and following reports that some in the White House are still not on board with making concessions, late breaking headlines quoting President Trump claim he has not agreed to Chinese demands for the removal of all levies.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound has retreated further from best levels despite more better than expected UK PMIs and a services headline print that rebounded to 50.0, with Cable down around weekly lows within a 1.2795-1.2950 range and Eur/Gbp vice-versa between 0.8660-0.8585 parameters. For once, political and Brexit uncertainty or bad news did not undermine/underpin Sterling as the election campaigns dominated domestic headlines and the only HoC vote of note was to choose a new Speaker. Instead, BoE ‘super’ Thursday turned out to be quite the opposite as 2 MPC voters dissented for a 25 bp ease, while the minutes and November MPR were both nuanced towards the dovish side. Note also, looming Moody’s ratings review could err on the side of an outlook downgrade.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the seemingly constructive (on balance) US-China Phase 1 trade vibe noted above, the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie are all ending the week weaker against their US counterpart, and at or near fresh wtd troughs. Aud/Usd is only just holding above 0.6850 after the RBA’s SOMP sounded somewhat less confident about a gentle economic turning point than the official post-policy meeting statement given a GDP forecast downgrade and discussion about non-standard stimulus. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd has lost sight of 0.6400 in wake moderately sub-consensus NZ Q3 jobs data that might warrant some acknowledgment from the RBNZ next week, and in similar vein Usd/Cad has responded to Canada’s labour report revealing a surprise decline in headline payrolls that would have been even worse without a rise in temps and could unnerve the BoC after last week’s more downbeat outlook/assessment. Usd/Cad currently above 1.3200 vs circa 1.3115 at the other extreme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Also flagging vs the Buck over the course of the week and ending close to worst levels on safe-haven unwinding and relative yield/Central Bank policy dynamics. Eur/Usd has recoiled from 1.1175 towards 1.1000 through a series of technical support levels and with the single currency perhaps factoring in some Spanish political premium ahead of the weekend election, while Usd/Chf is hovering just under 0.9975 vs almost 0.9850 after more dovish than usual SNB remarks from President Jordan and another increase in Swiss sight deposits. The BoJ has also been underlining its accommodation and Government reinforcing fiscal stimulus via PM Abe’s call for a supplementary budget, but the Yen retaining an element of underlying demand unlike Gold that has broken well below the Usd1500/oz threshold within a 109.48-108.20 approx band, perhaps on the premise that US-China trade hype is too euphoric or exuberant.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Plenty of big moves, individual drivers and country specific impulses behind them, but of those the Rand, Real and Lira have grabbed their fair share of headlines if not more. Eskom power issues and reduced capacity have blighted the Zar that started the week brightly on post-Moody’s SA ratings relief, while the Brl has been literally undermined by the underwhelming interest in Brazil’s TOR auction of oil site blocks as some lots received no bids at all and the biggest one on offer only a few outside Petrobras that already owns 90% of the field. Elsewhere, softer than forecast Turkish CPI ramped up the pressure on the CBRT to reverse even more monetary tightening, but the Try was also rattled by more sabre-rattling from President Erdogan on the Syria front and complaints about the US not upholding its end of the peace pact. Moreover, the Foreign Ministry announced that the 2nd part of Russian S-400 missile system parts are still planned to arrive in Turkey next year.</p>",

Elsewhere<strong>, Hang Seng (-0.7%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) </strong>were mixed as participants digested the latest trade figures which were better than expected but continued to show a contraction in both USD-denominated Exports and Imports, with the mainland bourses slightly favoured after MSCI raised China A-shares weighting in its Emerging Market Index to 4.10% from 2.55%.

(Newswires)</strong></p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European bourses are cautious, as optimism regarding an imminent breakthrough on the US/China trade front abates slightly </strong>amid mixed reports. European indices, remain just off recent highs, following a strong start to the month of November. In terms of sector performance; defensives are on the front foot, with Utilities (+0.3%) and Telecoms (+0.1%) the only sectors in the green. Meanwhile, the more risk sensitive Tech (-0.6%), Consumer Discretionary (-0.8%) and Materials (-0.9%) sectors are the laggards. Financials (-0.6%) are also lower, with underperformance seen in Credit Agricole (-3.3%) and Natixis (-5.5%) following earnings. In terms of other notable individual movers; Richemont (-5.1%) were hit on an underwhelming earnings report, in which performance in Hong Kong was a dark spot; other luxury names were also pressured, including LVMH (-0.2%) and Kering (-0.7%). Elsewhere in earnings, a weak report from Fincantieri (-6.0%) saw its share price under pressure, while strong earnings from Leonardo (+0.5%) saw its shares advance. Delivery Hero (+0.8%) were boosted after being reiterated with a buy at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD </strong>- All on the back foot, but to varying degrees and not the weakest G10 links as the Greenback remains firm across the board. However, the Aussie has pulled back a bit further from 0.6900 in wake of the RBA’s latest Statement of Monetary Policy that revealed more detailed discussions on unconventional easing measures given that rates are relatively low and a GDP downgrade. The Kiwi is only holding up marginally better, but sub-0.6350 as the Aud/Nzd cross retains 1.0800+ statust, while the Loonie is on the defensive near 1.3200 against the backdrop of weaker oil prices and ahead of Canadian jobs and housing data.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK </strong>- The Scandi Crowns are on the retreat after posting decent gains on Thursday and threatening or testing key resistance levels vs the Euro, but failing to breach or sustain momentum. Eur/Sek is back above 10.6500 and Eur/Nok over 10.1000, with the Swedish Krona not gleaning any support from solid household consumption or news that former SEB Chief Economist Bremen will become a Riksbank Deputy Governor and likely back a December repo rate hike.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY </strong>- Narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, as the DXY inches a tad further above 98.000 to notch a fractional new post-FOMC high (98.246), but extremely or even excruciatingly rangebound amidst a paucity of independent factors/drivers. Indeed, Cable is trapped within a 1.2825-1.2796 band awaiting Moody’s UK ratings review after hours and Eur/Usd is meandering between 1.3037-28, while Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy pivot 0.9950 and 109.25 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- The Rand remains on a roller-coaster, but still hampered by the ongoing Eskom power issues that is keeping Usd/Zar anchored around 14.8000, albeit with the broad Buck strength also impacting.</p><p><strong>RBA Statement on Monetary Policy noted the board is prepared to ease policy further if required and that the pause in November allows time to assess effects of past easing and global events.</strong> RBA added the board is mindful rates are very low, that further cuts bring closer other policy options, and is aware more easing could convey overly negative view of the economy. <strong>Furthermore, RBA stated the Australian economy is gradually coming out of a soft patch and that global financial markets appear to have passed a trough of pessimism, while it lowered GDP growth forecast for December 2019 to 2.25% (Prev. 2.50%) but maintained December 2020 growth forecast at 2.75% and kept underlying inflation forecasts unchanged. (Newswires)</strong></p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Hardly any deviation beyond earlier ranges, but <strong>Gilts</strong> remain relatively depressed and just off a minor new Liffe low (131.05, -20 ticks vs +4 ticks at one stage) and <strong>Italian bonds</strong> are also underperforming Eurozone peers near the base of 141.60-142.56 parameters after the BTP exchange auction. However, <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are still maintaining an underlying bid after Thursday’s rout and into the weekend that is 3 days long across the Atlantic due to Veterans Day, awaiting the preliminary Michigan sentiment survey for November, September wholesale inventories and sales plus more Fed speak.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Energy markets remain subdued with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures below the 56.50/bbl and 61.50/bbl marks respectively with lack of immediate fundamental catalysts at the time. In terms of technicals, Brent took out its 100 DMA to the downside (61.60/bbl) ahead of the 61.0/bbl psychological level with its 50 DMA seen at 60.93/bbl, whilst <strong>WTI</strong> sees support at 56/bbl which also coincides with its 100 DMA. Some cite recent downside in the complex to lower probably of deeper OPEC+ cuts in December given the seemingly improving US-China trade environment. Further, sources earlier in the week noted of hesitation from Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce output. Participants may also eye geopolitical events after reports that Iranian Air Defences have shot down drone over the port of Mahshahr, on the edge of Persian Gulf, although it is not clear to whom the drone belongs to. Turning to metals, gold prices remain modestly subdued with markets on standby for the latest in the US-Sino saga with the yellow metal below its 100 DMA (1476.90/oz). Finally, Copper prices are drifting lower towards the 2.7/lb level amid the cautious risk sentiment, again on the lookout for the latest trade headlines.</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European bourses are cautious, as optimism regarding an imminent breakthrough on the US/China trade front abates slightly </strong>amid mixed reports. European indices, remain just off recent highs, following a strong start to the month of November. In terms of sector performance; defensives are on the front foot, with Utilities (+0.3%) and Telecoms (+0.1%) the only sectors in the green. Meanwhile, the more risk sensitive Tech (-0.6%), Consumer Discretionary (-0.8%) and Materials (-0.9%) sectors are the laggards. Financials (-0.6%) are also lower, with underperformance seen in Credit Agricole (-3.3%) and Natixis (-5.5%) following earnings. In terms of other notable individual movers; Richemont (-5.1%) were hit on an underwhelming earnings report, in which performance in Hong Kong was a dark spot; other luxury names were also pressured, including LVMH (-0.2%) and Kering (-0.7%). Elsewhere in earnings, a weak report from Fincantieri (-6.0%) saw its share price under pressure, while strong earnings from Leonardo (+0.5%) saw its shares advance. Delivery Hero (+0.8%) were boosted after being reiterated with a buy at Goldman Sachs.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD </strong>- All on the back foot, but to varying degrees and not the weakest G10 links as the Greenback remains firm across the board. However, the Aussie has pulled back a bit further from 0.6900 in wake of the RBA’s latest Statement of Monetary Policy that revealed more detailed discussions on unconventional easing measures given that rates are relatively low and a GDP downgrade. The Kiwi is only holding up marginally better, but sub-0.6350 as the Aud/Nzd cross retains 1.0800+ statust, while the Loonie is on the defensive near 1.3200 against the backdrop of weaker oil prices and ahead of Canadian jobs and housing data.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK </strong>- The Scandi Crowns are on the retreat after posting decent gains on Thursday and threatening or testing key resistance levels vs the Euro, but failing to breach or sustain momentum. Eur/Sek is back above 10.6500 and Eur/Nok over 10.1000, with the Swedish Krona not gleaning any support from solid household consumption or news that former SEB Chief Economist Bremen will become a Riksbank Deputy Governor and likely back a December repo rate hike.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY </strong>- Narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, as the DXY inches a tad further above 98.000 to notch a fractional new post-FOMC high (98.246), but extremely or even excruciatingly rangebound amidst a paucity of independent factors/drivers. Indeed, Cable is trapped within a 1.2825-05 band awaiting Moody’s UK ratings review after hours and Eur/Usd is meandering between 1.3037-55 and almost equidistant from Fibs (1.1065 and 1.1030), while Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy pivot 0.9950 and 109.25 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- The Rand remains on a roller-coaster, but still hampered by the ongoing Eskom power issues that is keeping Usd/Zar anchored around 14.8000, albeit with the broad Buck strength also impacting.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Hardly any deviation beyond earlier ranges, but <strong>Gilts</strong> remain relatively depressed and just off a minor new Liffe low (131.05, -20 ticks vs +4 ticks at one stage) and <strong>Italian bonds</strong> are also underperforming Eurozone peers near the base of 141.60-142.56 parameters after the BTP exchange auction. However, <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are still maintaining an underlying bid after Thursday’s rout and into the weekend that is 3 days long across the Atlantic due to Veterans Day, awaiting the preliminary Michigan sentiment survey for November, September wholesale inventories and sales plus more Fed speak.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Energy markets remain subdued with WTI and Brent futures below the 56.50/bbl and 61.50/bbl marks respectively with lack of immediate fundamental catalysts at the time. In terms of technicals, Brent took out its 100 DMA to the downside (61.60/bbl) ahead of the 61.0/bbl psychological level with its 50 DMA seen at 60.93/bbl, whilst WTI sees support at 56/bbl which also coincides with its 100 DMA. Some cite recent downside in the complex to lower probably of deeper OPEC+ cuts in December given the seemingly improving US-China trade environment. Further, sources earlier in the week noted of hesitation from Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce output. Participants may also eye geopolitical events after reports that Iranian Air Defences have shot down drone over the port of Mahshahr, on the edge of Persian Gulf, although it is not clear to whom the drone belongs to. Turning to metals, gold prices remain modestly subdued with markets on standby for the latest in the US-Sino saga with the yellow metal below its 100 DMA (1476.90/oz). Finally, Copper prices are drifting lower towards the 2.7/lb level amid the cautious risk sentiment, again on the lookout for the latest trade headlines.</p>",

However, the Aussie has pulled back a bit further from 0.6900 in wake of the RBA’s latest Statement of Monetary Policy that revealed more detailed discussions on unconventional easing measures given that rates are relatively low and a GDP downgrade. The Kiwi is only holding up marginally better, but sub-0.6350 as the Aud/Nzd cross retains 1.0800+ statust, while the Loonie is on the defensive near 1.3200 against the backdrop of weaker oil prices and ahead of Canadian jobs and housing data.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are on the retreat after posting decent gains on Thursday and threatening or testing key resistance levels vs the Euro, but failing to breach or sustain momentum. Eur/Sek is back above 10.6500 and Eur/Nok over 10.1000, with the Swedish Krona not gleaning any support from solid household consumption or news that former SEB Chief Economist Bremen will become a Riksbank Deputy Governor and likely back a December repo rate hike.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, as the <strong>DXY </strong>inches a tad further above 98.000 to notch a fractional new post-FOMC high (98.246), but extremely or even excruciatingly rangebound amidst a paucity of independent factors/drivers. Indeed, Cable is trapped within a 1.2825-05 band awaiting Moody’s UK ratings review after hours and Eur/Usd is meandering between 1.3037-55 and almost equidistant from Fibs (1.1065 and 1.1030), while Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy pivot 0.9950 and 109.25 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand remains on a roller-coaster, but still hampered by the ongoing Eskom power issues that is keeping Usd/Zar anchored around 14.8000, albeit with the broad Buck strength also impacting.</p>",

However, although an impressive 30-year auction, it did little to change the dial on the sell-off in the debt complex. By settlement the US Treasury curve had re-steepened from Wednesday, with the 2s/10s just over 3bps wider, with the 2-year yield just over 7bps higher itself.

        "content": "<p>Asia traded mixed as the region failed to sustain the momentum from the record levels on Wall St. where sentiment was initially boosted after US and China were said to have agreed to cancel existing tariffs in different phases, although some of the gains were later reversed on reports of fierce internal opposition from the US regarding the tariff rollbacks. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were both lifted at the open although the sentiment in Australia gradually deteriorated amid hefty losses for gold miners and a growth forecast downgrade by the RBA, while Tokyo stocks also reversed course as a choppy currency overshadowed confirmation of an economic package and higher than expected Household Spending. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were mixed as participants digested the latest trade figures which were better than expected but continued to show a contracted in both USD-denominated Exports and Imports, with the mainland bourses slightly favoured after MSCI raised China A-shares weighting in its Emerging Market Index to 4.10% from 2.55%. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid spillover selling from USTs and with prices reeling from the recent rise in yields, while weaker results in the 10yr inflation-indexed auction added to the uninspiring tone.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as the region only partially sustains the momentum from the record highs on Wall Street, where sentiment was initially boosted after US and China were said to have agreed to cancel existing tariffs in different phases although some of the gains were later reversed on reports of fierce internal opposition from the US regarding tariff rollbacks. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were both lifted at the open although the sentiment in Australia gradually deteriorated amid hefty losses for gold miners and growth forecast downgrade by the RBA, while Tokyo stocks also reversed course as a choppy currency overshadowed confirmation of an economic package and higher than expected Household Spending. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are mixed ahead of the latest China trade figures and as the PBoC opted for a net neutral liquidity position throughout the week, although the mainland is mildly favoured after MSCI raised China A-shares weighting in its Emerging Market Index to 4.10% from 2.55%.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firm and sits above the 98.00 level as a result of the improving US-China trade climate and lacklustre trade in its major counterparts with EUR/USD stuck around 1.1050, while GBP/USD briefly attempted a breakdown of support at 1.2800 following the dovish BoE meeting where the MPC kept rates unchanged at 0.75% as expected although there was surprise dissent as Haskel and Saunders opted for a 25bps reduction. Elsewhere, USD/JPY trades choppy in reflection of the wavering overnight risk tone and antipodeans are subdued with AUD/USD mildly pressured after the RBA Monetary Police Statement in which it reiterated a willingness to ease policy further if required and lowered its year-end GDP growth forecast, but with downside stemmed amid the recent CNY strength in which the PBoC set the reference rate firmer than 7.0000 against the greenback for the first time in over 3 months.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid spillover selling from USTs and with prices reeling from the recent rise in yields, while participants are also sidelined as they await the 10yr inflation-indexed auction later.&nbsp;</p>",
