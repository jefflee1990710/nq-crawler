(Twitter)</p><p>UK opposition leader Corbyn said opposition MPs will continue efforts to pass a law to prevent a no-deal and will also keep the option open for a vote of no confidence, while Corbyn was also said to have written to the Queen to express concerns over the proroguing of parliament and requested a meeting. (Twitter/ITV/Guardian)</p><p>Labour MP Ian Murray said a cross-party group of more than 70 MPs will now consider seeking an interim interdict in a Court of Session to block prorogation with the hearing to be scheduled for 6th September, while there were comments from an anti no-deal lawmaker that MPs are confident they still have legislative time and procedural ability to block PM Johnson's prorogation plan. (Newswires/Sky/Twitter)</p><p>EU Brexit Coordinator Verhofstadt was negative on today's Brexit events in which he stated 'taking back control' has never looked so sinister and that he is in solidarity with lawmakers fighting for their voices to be heard, while he added that suppressing debate on profound choices is unlikely to help deliver a stable future EU/UK relationship. There were also comments from an EU source that there is a strong sense that no-deal has just become even more of a likely possibility than it was before. (Newswires/Sun)</p><p>Irish Foreign Minister Coveney reiterated that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated, while he added that it cannot be done in 6-10 weeks and that backstop alternatives must do the same job as the backstop. (Newswires)</p><p>Italy's Di Maio said that after meeting President Mattarella, he was told there was a political accord with PD that Conte should be PM, while he added that their programme remains the same as always and the League asked him to be PM in a new government but he is interested in the country not his personal ambition. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SNB's Maechler said uncertainty level is quite high and greater than at the first Brexit vote as well as 2016 US election, while Swiss inflation pressures remain very weak and that expansionary monetary policy remains needed. Furthermore, Maechler commented that the attractiveness of the Swiss Franc has enormously increased although a negative rate helps reduce the Franc's attractiveness and that the SNB stills have plenty of room for FX intervention.

In related news, there were reports the US Treasury targets procurement networks supporting Iran's missile proliferation programs with sanctions and that one network used Hong Kong-based front company to evade US and international sanctions, while two Iranian government-linked networks engaged in covert procurement activity benefiting Iranian military organisations. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>US President Trump reiterated criticisms of the Fed in which he suggested the Fed has no clue and cannot “mentally” keep up with the competition, while he also noted that leaders of other countries at the G-7 in France were giddy about how low their interest costs have gone with Germany actually “getting paid” to borrow money. (Twitter)</p><p>Fed's Barkin (non-voter) said he is not yet persuaded on the weak inflation part of the case for a rate cut but is watching risks to growth closely and is holding his decision on rate policy until he gets to the September meeting. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Markets gave somewhat mixed signals on Wednesday with equities, bonds, DX and energy firmer on the day, with the ever focused on 2s10s inversion reaching 0.6bps before halving into the close. Equities caught a bid going into the US session, albeit the SPX failed to breach Tuesday's high of 2898, with the tech sector restraining indices as Autodesk (ADSK) weighed on cloud providers (MSFT, ADBE, CRM, ORCL) after pessimistic guidance. There was a spell of textbook risk-on around the US equity open as Treasuries, XAU, and JPY saw some selling pressure whilst equities had their time to shine. However, a dismal earnings report and guidance from Autodesk (ADSK) saw the stock plummet, and provided pressure on other cloud players (MSFT, ADBE, ORCL, CRM). Strong crude oil prices boosted the energy sector in general. Coty (COTY) outperformed after its optimistic guidance. Brown Forman (BF.B) hit on lower Jack Daniels demand. Tiffany (TIF) suffered from pessimistic earnings and guidance. Phillip Morris (PM) was higher following its strong sell-off on Tuesday on the announcement of the Altria (MO) merger talks. S&amp;P 500 +0.7% at 2888, NASDAQ-100 0.3% at 7588, Dow Jones 1% at 26036.</p><p>The TPLEX again moved higher on Wednesday despite firmer equity indices, catching steam on the back of a strong 5-year Note auction; some desks were also attributing the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit as a tailwind. Yields continued to exacerbate their inversion with the 2s10s testing just shy of -0.6bps; on the outlook Nordea noted that inversions deepen for two to three months usually – once initially inverted - based on the past five inversions. The 5-year Note auction saw a chunky 1bps stop through the screens with the B/C ratio at 2.48x (avg. 2.36x); both indirects and dealers took above their six-auction averages, leaving less for dealers in what was evidently a strong auction. At settlement the curve was actually steeper, expect in the belly- to long-end, with Treasury yields lower between 1.5bps to 2.5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 7 ticks higher at 131.11+.</p>",

Equities caught a bid going into the US session, albeit the SPX failed to breach Tuesday's high of 2898, with the tech sector restraining indices as Autodesk (ADSK) weighed on cloud providers (MSFT, ADBE, CRM, ORCL) after pessimistic guidance. There was a spell of textbook risk-on around the US equity open as Treasuries, XAU, and JPY saw some selling pressure whilst equities had their time to shine. However, a strong US 5-year Note auction brought bidders to the TPLEX and fed through to appetite for bullion whilst bringing equities off their highs. Crude prices held their API induced gains as the EIA affirmed a 10mln barrel draw in US crude stocks, although came off highs into settlement. Elsewhere, US participants seemingly shrugged off concerns of the increasingly likely No Deal Brexit, an often-cited Fed concern, which did see GBP weaker after her majesty approved PM Johnson's request to suspend parliament to avoid MP efforts to block a no-deal. BTP's moved higher through the European session on positive hopes for the Italian government, hopes which were later vindicated as the 5SM and PD came to a political accord for a Conte-lead, new government.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The Queen has accepted a request by the government to prorogue Parliament (no earlier than 9th September, and no later than 12th September, and running through 14th October), a move that limits options for pro-European lawmakers that want to pass legislation to extend Article 50 and delay a no deal Brexit. Reports suggest that there would be a small window next week and the week after for MPs to attempt to pass some legislation, although the consensus view is that may not be enough time. Given the argument that the EU has been on the sidelines, awaiting moves by pro-European MPs to take action to stop Brexit, before making any commitment to re-open the Withdrawal Agreement, today's moves will put pressure on the bloc to compromise on the Irish backstop (a notion already dismissed by the Irish finance minister today). It also increases the probability of an accidental no deal Brexit, and earlier General Elections. Some journalists suggested that the likely impact of the five-week prorogation will be to bring forward votes of no confidence in PM Johnson's government next week, although some anti-Brexit MPs have reportedly admitted they lack numbers. From a legal perspective, watchers also noted that the legal options to prevent prorogation are also limited. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-potential-parliament-prorogation-ahead-28-08-2019\">Click here for further analysis.</a></p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>US President Trump reiterated his well-known stance, that the US was doing well on China. However, White House Security Advisor Bolton, a China Hawk, stated that the US and China have significant differences over trade, and he reiterated that China was stealing US’ intellectual property for decades. The Chief of Staff to VP Pence was more sanguine and said there have been calls between US and China, and that he himself was optimistic, but it was unclear when a deal will happen. Meanwhile, following last week’s request from US President Trump for US companies to pull out of China, Nikkei reported Alphabet (GOOGL) is to move its Pixel smartphone production from China to Vietnam. Elsewhere, WSJ reported that US Officials are looking to block an undersea cable backed by Google, Facebook (FB) and a Chinese partner on the back national security concerns; which could reportedly rewrite the rules of internet connectivity between the two nations. In a procedural move, the US Federal Register confirmed President Trump’s latest moves to to raise tariffs on USD 300bln of Chinese goods to 15% from 10% beginning on Sept 1st, while there were separate reports that China will take in the 2nd batch of tariff exemption applications on September 2nd.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>The US Treasury has sanctioned two networks it says have helped Iran’s nuclear programme in its latest efforts to place “maximum pressure” on Tehran, and just days after the positive comments made at the G7 by both US President Trump and French President Macron. One of the networks allegedly uses a Hong Kong-based front company in order to evade US and international sanctions, potentially giving a “shoe-in” for US intervention in Hong Kong.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY/RUSSIA: </strong>Russian and Turkey are reportedly discussing the deliveries of Russian made SU-35 and SU-57 aircraft to Turkey and are also pondering collaborating on creating a new fighter jet. This will likely not go down well for Turkey in Washington, where tensions are already fragile over Turkey’s decision to purchase the Russian S-400 missile defence system, a red-line for the US who has since banned Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet programme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The 5SM and PD came to a political accord to form a government with Conte as PM, who is reportedly going to be sworn in tomorrow morning at 0930 BST by President Mattarella. However, earlier reports did suggest 5SM leader Di Maio's personal ambitions are blocking a final agreement. BTPs have strengthened this week, implying a belief that a 5SM/PD coalition would keep Italy's public deficit beneath the 3%/GDP EU target in 2020. The deal will likely lend further strength to Italian bonds, analysts said, with the 10-year yield on Wednesday seeing fresh record lows under 1%; but higher relative Italian yields, and the prospect of ECB easing in September are also likely to provide tailwinds for Italian debt, some strategists reasoned. Indeed, the ECB's upcoming meeting may perhaps be one of the reasons why the Bund/BTP spread has not been able to exert its influence on the EUR in this summer's Italian crisis.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 131.11+: </strong>The TPLEX again moved higher on Wednesday despite firmer equity indices, catching steam on the back of a strong 5-year Note auction; some desks were also attributing the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit as a tailwind. Yields continued to exacerbate their inversion with the 2s10s testing just shy of -0.6bps; on the outlook Nordea noted that inversions deepen for two to three months usually – once initially inverted - based on the past five inversions. The 5-year Note auction saw a chunky 1bps stop through the screens with the B/C ratio at 2.48x (avg. 2.36x); both indirects and dealers took above their six-auction averages, leaving less for dealers in what was evidently a strong auction. At settlement the curve was actually steeper, expect in the belly- to long-end, with Treasury yields lower between 1.5bps to 2.5bps.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (Tue, USD 40bln), new 5-year note (Wed, USD 41bln) and new 7-year note (Thu, USD 32bln). Analysts at UBS say this week will bring USD 85bln of cash (excluding SOMA holdings) but including around USD 76bln of redemption, as well as around USD 8.5bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>* 7- YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>SocGen's strategists say the 7-year sector trades cheap in asset swap versus older 7s, but trades fair on the curve against 5s and 10s. Last month's auction was weak, tailing and seeing the softest cover since February 2016. SocGen says the sale will likely need concession this month, since the current when-issued trades below all stop out rates since 2016, and as such, the bank says it is negative on the auction.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 0.85 HIGHER AT USD 55.78/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES USD 0.90 HIGHER AT USD 59.93/BBL: </strong>A bullish API inventory report (which was later vindicated by the official EIA release) and firmer risk appetite saw crude benchmarks both push over one buck higher on Wednesday, before paring back into settlement. EIA reported US crude stocks drawing a hefty 10mln bbls (exp. -2.5mln), albeit slightly smaller than the API reported 11.1mln draw; the products surprised to bullish side with both gasoline (exp. -0.4mln) and distillates (exp. +0.9mln) drawing 2.1mln bbls, whilst Cushing stocks drew 2mln bbls. A 0.2mln BPD rise in crude exports, coupled by a 1.3mln BPD fall in imports saw net imports fall to 2.9mln BPD, where a new record production of 12.5mln BPD likely reduced refiners’ need for imported crude; refinery utilisation fell by 0.7% (exp. -0.3%). Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley is the latest forecaster to lowers its oil demand growth estimates: 2019 to 800k BPD (Prev. 1.0mln BPD), 2020 to 1.0mln BPD (Prev. 1.4mln BPD), and now sees Brent prices fluctuating around USD 60/bbl (Prev. USD 65/bbl).</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 0.7% at 2888, NASDAQ-100 0.3% at 7588, Dow Jones 1% at 26036, S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 1.1%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.9%, Energy&nbsp; 1.4%, Financials&nbsp; 0.9%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.7%, Industrials&nbsp; 1.1%, Information Technology&nbsp; 0.1%, Materials&nbsp; 0.9%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.5%, Utilities&nbsp; -0.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>A dismal earnings report and guidance from Autodesk (ADSK) saw the stock plummet, and provided pressure on other cloud players (MSFT, ADBE, ORCL, CRM). Strong crude oil prices boosted the energy sector in general. Coty (COTY) outperformed after its optimistic guidance. Brown Forman (BF.B) hit on lower Jack Daniels demand. Tiffany (TIF) suffered from pessimistic earnings and guidance. Phillip Morris (PM) was higher following its strong sell-off on Tuesday on the announcement of the Altria (MO) merger talks.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>GBP </strong>unlike Tuesday, was the underperforming currency on Wednesday as the Queen approved the request to prorogue parliament from no sooner than September 9th and no later than September 12th, until October 14th; limiting time for the Anti-No Deal team to put together a legislative way to prevent a no deal. GBPUSD initially breached 1.22 to the downside however the moves were pared back above the key level and the cross remained above it throughout the rest of the session.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong> was lower against the dollar after SocGen touted towards ECB releasing an open-ended QE programme at the September meeting (EUR 40bln per month). The cross also had chunky option expiries, 1.8bln worth, at the 1.11 strike; however, the cross traded beneath this level heading into the NY cut. The single currency shrugged off weak import/export prices from Germany, however GfK Consumer Sentiment did surprise slightly to the upside. EURUSD was relatively rangebound today, however it has declined for three consecutive sessions and threats heading towards the 2019 low of 1.1027.</p><p><strong>ANTIPODES</strong>: Roles continue to reverse down under where the Antipodean Dollars are both weaker vs their US counterpart, but the Kiwi has replaced the Aussie as whipping boy down under, as NZDUSD slips further towards 0.6325 vs AUDUSD holding within a 0.6762-35 range and AUDNZD firmly above 1.0600 between 1.0605-50.</p><p><strong>Havens:</strong> USDJPY traded relatively rangebound throughout the early morning session, however as risk appetitive improved once the US session took course, the pair caught wind and drifted through the 106 handle in later trade and found resistance at Tuesday’s high and 10dma of 106.15/16. XAU trended higher prior to the US open but sold off once the US session was underway and remained lower heading into APAC trade. The precious metal did see some volatility heading into settlement as the Aug19 futures expired. CHF relatively flat on the day and seemingly unphased by Maechler’s comments of scope for more FX intervention.</p><p><strong>SNB:</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>SNB’s Maechler said Swiss inflation pressures remain very weak, and expansionary monetary policy remains needed. On the Franc, Maechler said its attractiveness had enormously increased, where a negative rate is helping to reduce that; adding that there is still plenty of room for FX intervention. Maechler noted that the current uncertainty level is quite high, referencing it as higher than it was at the first Brexit vote and 2016 US election.</p><p><strong>EM: </strong>BRL unwound gains from the central bank intervention the prior day from further dovish BCB commentary, MXN was lower after Banxico released its QIR where it cut its 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts, as well as its year end 2019 inflation forecast;&nbsp; maintaining its year end 2020 forecast. The ARS was also lower despite central bank intervention which, according to traders, once again breached the IMF’s daily guidance as it sold a further USD 367mln of reserves across 7 separate interventions.&nbsp; TRY outperformed with the aid of improved Turkish consumer morale whereas RUB failed to shrug off sanctions and the loss of local tax payment demand.</p>",

The 5-year Note auction saw a chunky 1bps stop through the screens with the B/C ratio at 2.48x (avg. 2.36x); both indirects and dealers took above their six-auction averages, leaving less for dealers in what was evidently a strong auction. At settlement the curve was actually steeper, expect in the belly- to long-end, with Treasury yields lower between 1.5bps to 2.5bps.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/NZD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Well off worst levels, but the Pound remains at the bottom of the G10 table after confirmation via the Privy Council Office that the Queen has approved the request to prorogue parliament from no sooner than September 9 and no later than the 12th until October 14. This effectively limits the time available for the anti-no deal Brexit brigade to enact legislation ahead of the October 31 deadline given that MPs are only due to return from Summer recess on September 3. Hence, if PM Johnson fails to present compatible alternatives to the Irish backstop and the EU remains adamant that the WA that includes the current border arrangement is written in stone, the odds of Britain leaving without an accord appear to have shortened again. Cable is clinging to 1.2200 and Eur/Gbp holding midway between 0.9024-0.9124, but the cross is still prone to RHS demand for month end. Meanwhile, roles continue to reverse down under where the Antipodean Dollars are both weaker vs their US counterpart, but the Kiwi has replaced the Aussie as whipping boy down under, as Nzd/Usd slips further towards 0.6325 vs Aud/Usd holding within a 0.6762-35 range and Aud/Nzd firmly above 1.0600 between 1.0605-45. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns continue to dovetail, and after a run of upbeat Swedish data underpinned the Sek through swings in broad risk sentiment a firmer recovery in oil is now helping the Nok to contain losses vs the Eur around 10.0230 compared to 10.7800 for its Krona rival.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>All softer against the Greenback, as the <strong>DXY</strong> edges up to a marginal new session high (98.227) and the Euro loses a bit more ground amidst another dovish ECB call (open-ended asset purchases touted by a French bank). Moreover, any pull exerted by a decent option expiry interest at 1.1100 (1.8 bn) disappeared when that rolled off, and the Yen also slipped towards 106.00 again when 1.1 bn expired unscathed between 105.75-80. However, the aforementioned crude revival did help the Loonie recover from circa 1.3315 to 1.3280 at one stage, with EIA inventories also revealing a much bigger draw than expected in line with API stocks on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some regional currencies recouped losses vs the Usd, while the Try actually outperformed with the aid of improved Turkish consumer morale, but the Brl was hampered by more dovish BCB commentary and the Ars markedly underperformed even though the Central Bank intervened 3 times compared to the usual twice a day ops. Similarly, the Rub could not shrug off sanctions and the loss of local tax payment demand.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Snapshot</strong></p><ul><li>PM Johnson is to attempt to prorogue parliament from September 9th for around 5 weeks to return on October 14th for the Queens speech and then subsequent debates and votes on the speech. In terms of context, this leaves a short window of opportunity from Parliaments return on September 3rd to pass legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit.</li></ul><p><strong>Details</strong></p><ul><li>UK politics has erupted today ahead of the official return of parliament on September 3rd next week. UK PM Johnson has confirmed that parliament will be suspended from around September 9th, and October’s party conference recess to be extended by one week until October 14th for the Queen’s speech.</li><li>In terms of timings, the prorogation will indicatively take place from September 9th (though some reports do indicate September 11th instead), for around 5 weeks with Parliament to return on October 14th for the Queen’s speech. While some have noted that such a move by the UK Government is unacceptable etc., indications are that it is perfectly legal for this to occur and that there is no scope for legislation to stop the routine process around the Queen’s speech. Regarding the length of the break, while it is somewhat longer than typical as the prior Queen’s speech was two years ago the extended length maybe a justifiable reflection of that.</li><li>Upon Parliaments return on October 14th, this time will be taken up by debated on the Queen’s speech and then subsequent votes on it leaving very little time to prevent a no-deal; particularly as the European Council conference is on the 17-18th October, which is the effective date for a deal to be agreed upon before the October 31st extension end.</li><li>As such, the two weeks between September 3rd and 9th/11th are the most likely opportunity for any legislation to stop a no-deal, which has scope as Opposition Leaders have agreed to table a law with the intent of stopping a no-deal alongside over 200 MPs yesterday signing a declaration to continue to run parliament elsewhere in the event it is suspended. On the possibility of a no-confidence vote, this is possible however recently opposition politicians have stated that they do not have the support required for such a vote and that it is their last resort.</li></ul><p><strong>Dates:</strong></p><ul><li>September 3rd: Parliament Returns</li><li>September 5th: Potential date for a General Election to be called</li><li>September 9th -11th: Parliament Suspended</li><li>September 19th: BoE Rate Decision</li><li>September 22nd- 25th: Labour Party Conference</li><li>September 28th – October 2nd: Tory Party Conference</li><li>October 14th: Queen’s Speech</li><li>October 17th: Potential General Election date (if called on September 5th)</li><li>October 17th- 18th: European Council Meeting (Informal deadline for a Brexit deal to be agreed)</li><li>October 21st – 22nd: Votes on the Queen’s Speech</li><li>October 31st: Scheduled Brexit date</li><li>November 7th: BoE Rate Decision and QIR</li></ul><p><strong>Ability to Block No-Deal</strong></p><ul><li>Parliaments prorogation makes the possibility of no-deal being blocked via legislation or a no-confidence vote significantly less likely. The likelihood of this is further reduced if other possible measures the government could used to fill the available time are taken into account, such as holding the budget in October after the Queen’s speech. Hence, the risk of a no-deal is more prominent, illustrated by Sterling’s slip today.</li><li>In terms of the legislative route, ING notes this encompasses the passing of legislation to force the PM to ask for another Article 50 extension. A process which would heavily rely on House Speaker Bercow, due to his role in Parliamentary scheduling. Bercow’s support to this route is like given his comments today in response to the suspension of parliament that ‘this move represents a constitutional outrage, blindingly obvious that the prorogation is to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing their duty’.</li><li>Regarding a no-confidence vote, this is possible but the Opposition have made it clear that their preferred method is the legislative route. Recent narrative on a no-confidence vote from opposition MP’s indicates that they do not believe they have the required amount of support in the House to win a no-confidence vote.</li></ul><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><ul><li>ING see further pressure on Sterling in the weeks ahead as the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen, and will likely increase further as the window of opportunity prior to parliaments suspension on around September 9th closes. Specifically, ING call for EUR/GBP to retest its multi-year high at 0.9325 towards the middle of October as the European Commission summit approaches.</li></ul><p><strong>Scenario Analysis via ING</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/bcc8f94c-317c-41df-9c0e-4b2710a63024.jpg\"></figure>",

Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices fell to the lowest in 2 ½ months as falling steel prices continue to raise concerns regarding iron ore demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>A week may be a long time in politics, but for Sterling 24 hours is all it has taken to turn from major outperformer to laggard as Brexit positivity evaporates and the prospect of a no confidence vote in the UK Government rises on the back of PM Johnson’s request to the Queen to suspend Parliament. In short, the move is being framed as a tactical decision to head off legislative attempts to stop a no deal Brexit by curtailing the amount of time between the now delayed Queen’s speech (October 14 from 7 originally) and October 31 Article 50 extension date. In response, Cable tumbled from just under 1.2300 to circa 1.2156 and not far from technical support around 1.2150 in the form of the 21 DMA at 1.2149, while Eur/Gbp rebounded almost a full point towards 0.9125 before the Pound pared some lost ground.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar is obviously deriving indirect impetus from Sterling’s demise, but also firmer against all G10 counterparts bar the Euro that is holding close to 1.1100 on more progress towards a new Italian political partnership between the PD and 5-Star Movement. Hence, the <strong>DXY</strong> is consolidating above the 98.000 level, albeit within a confined 98.173-003 range ahead of a couple of Fed speakers and the latest Beige Book.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>As noted above, all weaker vs the Greenback, albeit to varying degrees as the Kiwi slips back below 0.6350 and towards 1.0650 against the Aussie that is pivoting 0.6750 and only partially impeded by overnight data showing considerably weaker than forecast Q2 construction work. Meanwhile, the Loonie is still straddling 1.3300 as fragile/weak risk sentiment offsets firm crude prices, with the Yen and Franc regaining some safe-haven allure, but remaining off recent peaks, as Usd/Jpy hovers near 105.75 and Usd/Chf meanders between 0.9810-30. Note, several hefty option expiries could have a bearing on direction into Wednesday’s NY cut including 1.8 bn in Eur/Usd at the 1.1100 strike, 1 bn in Aud/Usd from 0.6700-10 and 1.1 bn in Usd/Jpy between 105.75-80.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad weakness vs the Buck, but the Lira deriving comfort from another significant improvement in Turkish sentiment and this time on the consumer front. Indeed, Usd/Try is probing 5.8000 support even though Turkey and Russia are pressing ahead with more arms deal plans and the US House of Foreign Affairs Committee is urging President Trump to sanction Turkey. Conversely, the Rouble and Rand are not benefiting from the rebound in Brent and latest SA economic package respectively.</p>",

UK PM Johnson has confirmed that parliament will be suspended from around September 9th, and October’s party conference recess to be extended by one week until October 14th for the Queen’s speech.</li><li>In terms of timings, the prorogation will indicatively take place from September 9th (though some reports do indicate September 11th instead), for around 5 weeks with Parliament to return on October 14th for the Queen’s speech. While some have noted that such a move by the UK Government is unacceptable etc., indications are that it is perfectly legal for this to occur and that there is no scope for legislation to stop the routine process around the Queen’s speech. Regarding the length of the break, while it is somewhat longer than typical as the prior Queen’s speech was two years ago the extended length maybe a justifiable reflection of that.</li><li>Upon Parliaments return on October 14th, this time will be taken up by debated on the Queen’s speech and then subsequent votes on it leaving very little time to prevent a no-deal; particularly as the European Council conference is on the 17-18th October, which is the effective date for a deal to be agreed upon before the October 31st extension end.</li><li>As such, the two weeks between September 3rd and 9th/11th are the most likely opportunity for any legislation to stop a no-deal, which has scope as Opposition Leaders have agreed to table a law with the intent of stopping a no-deal alongside over 200 MPs yesterday signing a declaration to continue to run parliament elsewhere in the event it is suspended. On the possibility of a no-confidence vote, this is possible however recently opposition politicians have stated that they do not have the support required for such a vote and that it is their last resort.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*THE LATEST:</strong> The 5SM and PD parties have until later today to form a coalition after overcoming a hurdle regarding Conte as PM in a potential coalition. A PD lawmaker noted that talks with the 5SM party are progressing in a fruitful way and they will continue their meeting today. PD are willing to accept Conte as PM of a new government, although they wish to limit the role of 5SM leader Di Maio. Sources stated that the main issue is the 5SM leader’s refusal to step down as deputy PM in exchange for Conte resuming the top role. If the parties fail to form a coalition, President Mattarella will name a caretaker government and call for early elections.</p><p><strong>*STICKING POINTS:</strong> Some hurdles remain between the two parties:</p><ul><li><strong>Parliamentary reform: </strong>One of 5SM’s key demands. The proposal will see the number of MPs in both houses cut from 945 to 600, this has been approved by parliament on three occasions, with the fourth vote due in September. “PD may only agree to this in conjunction with broader constitutional reform” BBC writes.</li><li><strong>2020 Budget:</strong> Desks note that the two parties are expected to have differences over the 2020 budget which must comply with EU deficit rules.</li><li><strong>Immigration:</strong> The PD party will seek a rollback on immigration measures imposed by the League party. Although these were pushed forward by League leader Salvini, ultimately 5SM agreed to them.</li><li><strong>Online vote: </strong>The 5SM usually puts key strategic decisions to an online vote of its members. Such a move could wreck the potential deal, given that the populist party’s leadership is split between those who favour a coalition with 5SM and those who believe it will hamper voter support. Deputy PM Di Maio said the 5-Star leadership will support a new government only if party members approve it through an online vote planned by next week.</li></ul><p><strong>*PEBBLE IN DI MAIO’S SHOE:</strong> The FT yesterday reported that activists from the 5SM have threatened to desert the party if it enters into a coalition with the PD. Rome-based 5SM activist Lazzari told the FT that “almost everyone” is against the hypothetical agreement with the PD, “The PD are too pro-Euro, too liberal,” he said. 5SM leader Di Maio has put forth a list of ten policy points for any future coalition.</p><p><strong>*SCHEDULE:</strong></p><ul><li>28th Aug – President Mattarella will be meeting with the main players</li></ul><p>&nbsp;- PD (1500BST/1000ET)</p><p>&nbsp;- Forza Italia (1600BST/1100ET)</p><p>&nbsp;- League (1700BST/1200ET)</p><p>&nbsp;- 5SM (1800BST/1300ET)</p><ul><li>27th Sep – Parliament starts reviewing budget law for 2020</li><li>15th Oct – 2020 Budget has to be submitted to the European Commission</li><li>20th Oct – 2020 Budget goes to the Italian Parliament</li></ul><p><strong>*RATING AGENCIES:</strong></p><ul><li>6th Sep – Moody’s to review Italy’s credit rating</li><li>25th Oct – S&amp;P to review Italy’s credit rating</li></ul>",

Also ahead, Eurozone money supply and any weakness will underpin dovish ECB expectations for next month’s policy meeting, especially after latest comments from de Guindos on Tuesday about making determined decisions.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets struggled for direction after the subdued performance on Wall St, where the major indices failed to sustain initial gains amid the recent mixed signals on US-China trade and as the US yield curve inversion deepened. ASX 200 (+0.4%) was led higher by strength in tech and miners although gains were capped by weakness in telecoms as Telstra shares declined on ex-dividend day and with earnings in focus including Virgin Australia which was pressured after its annual results remained in the red, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) also lacked firm direction amid an uneventful currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) traded tentative and failed to benefit from the government’s recent announced measures to boost consumption with markets wary after the recent flip-flopping in the US-China trade saga, while a neutral PBoC liquidity operation and deluge of earnings ahead of the Big 4 bank results added to the cautious tone. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly higher as super-long yields declined to multi-year lows with both 30yr and 40yr JGB yields at the lowest since July 2016, while the moves also followed the bull flattening seen in their US counterparts where the 2s/10s inversion briefly widened past -5bps.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region struggling for direction after the subdued performance on Wall St where the major indices failed to sustain initial gains as participants reflected on the recent mixed signals on US-China trade and as the US yield curve inversion deepened. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is indecisive with strength in miners counterbalanced by weakness in telecoms as Telstra shares decline on ex-dividend day and with earnings in focus including Virgin Australia which is pressured after its annual results remained in the red, while Nikkei 225 (Unch.) also lacks firm direction amid an uneventful currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are tentative and fail to benefit from the government’s recent announced measures to boost consumption with markets wary after the recent flip-flopping in the US-China trade saga, while a neutral PBoC liquidity operation and deluge of earnings ahead of the Big 4 bank results adds to the cautious tone.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly higher as it prods above the 98.00 and attempts to break out of the prior day’s flat performance, while its major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD languishing below 1.1100 after recent data confirmed the German economy contracted in Q2 and ECB’s Vice President de Guindos suggested the central bank must act with determination. GBP/USD pulled back after it met resistance around 1.2300 but holds on to the majority of the recent gains spurred after opposition party leaders met and agreed a legislative route was the most promising path to blocking a no-deal scenario. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is flat amid the inconclusive risk appetite and antipodeans are subdued as early support from a firmer than expected reference rate setting is overshadowed by disappointing Australian Q2 Construction Work data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher as super-long yields decline to multi-year lows with both 30yr and 40yr JGB yields at the lowest since July 2016, while the moves also follow the bull flattening seen in their US counterparts where the 2s/10s inversion briefly widened to over -5bps.</p>",
