Data on Wednesday saw the Atlanta Fed revise its GDPnow tracker for Q4 up to 1.7% from 0.4%. The stronger than expected 2nd estimate for Q2 US GDP (2.1% vs. exp. 1.9%) helped set the positive tone for equities, in addition to a surprise rise in durable goods and less than expected initial jobless claims. However, core PCE came in slightly less than expected at 1.6% and the Chicago PMI printed a disappointing 46.3 (exp. 47.0), but animal spirits weren't dissuaded as risk appetite grew through the session amid the thinner liquidity. Under Armour (UAA) surged after being upgraded to Strong Buy at Raymond James, citing favourable risk/return. Tesla (TSLA) faded initial gains spurred by Elon Musk tweeting that Cybertruck orders had reached 250k. Tapestry (TPR) and Capri Holdings (CPRI) were firmer after being mentioned at Citi as potential acquisition targets of the hungry PVH Corp (PVH), whose stock traded lower. Bristol Myers (BMY) was supported by a Buy initiation at Gabelli. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) suffered on weaker metals prices.

The strong 7-year auction failed to provide a meaningful bid too, where the US sold USD 32bln of 7-year paper on the screws, with above average takedown from foreign bidders and B/C ratio, whilst dealers took less than average. The curve, in fact, bear flattened on the day, where despite a less-than-rosy PCE release, the front-end was sold the most (NOTE: the Fed has expressed its unwillingness to raise rates until inflation is comfortably above its 2% target, however). The 2s10s fell by around 1.5bps, flirting with the 14bps support level, whilst the 2s30s fell by just shy of 3bps; the 2-year yield settled 4bps higher. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 10 ticks lower at 129-12.</p>",

Data on Wednesday saw the Atlanta Fed revise its GDPnow tracker for Q4 up to 1.7% from 0.4%. The stronger than expected 2nd estimate for Q2 US GDP (2.1% vs. exp. 1.9%) helped set the positive tone for equities, in addition to a surprise rise in durable goods and less than expected initial jobless claims. However, core PCE came in slightly less than expected at 1.6% and the Chicago PMI printed a disappointing 46.3 (exp. 47.0), but animal spirits weren't dissuaded as risk appetite grew through the session amid the thinner liquidity. In sectors, Consumer Discretionary led the pack, helped by a strong upgrade for UAA, the cyclical telecoms and IT sectors also outperformed, with the latter boosted by ADSK earnings and appetite for SOX; conversely, industrials lagged after more aircraft issues for BA, in addition to ominous outlook from DE earnings, weighing on CAT too. The noted industrial weakness explained the DJIA's relative underperformance, whilst the tech focused NDQ outperformed. Later this evening at 17:00 ET / 22:00 GMT, YouGov will be releasing its MRP model, with earlier sources suggesting a clear conservative majority. The rest of the week has little to look ahead to, given the US holiday, although one could potentially see large market moves given the lack of liquidity.</p><p><strong>* US GDP (Q3): </strong>The second and final reading for US GDP growth in Q3 came in at 2.1%, above expectations for pace of growth to remain unchanged at 1.9%, indicating the economy is “not about to fall off a cliff” say Oxford Economics. The headline GDP figure was assisted by a strong 2.9% rise in consumer spending and solid 5.1% gains in residential investment, the sectors first gain since late 2017. Moreover, inventories were revised higher to contribute 0.2% to the headline, compared to the previous estimate of a 0.1% drag. However, business spending remained depressed, falling 2.7%, due to “weakness in structures and equipment investment”; notes the desk. The consultancy concludes that “lingering global industrial slump, persistent trade policy uncertainty and cooling income growth all point to weaker activity in the coming months.” In terms of inflation for Q3; headline PCE stayed at 1.4% and the core measure came in at 1.7%. Looking ahead, OxExo suggest that “the persistent inflation undershoot, weakened inflation expectations along with increased softness in domestic activity will likely lead the Fed to reassess the outlook in early 2020, and provide another rate cut in March.”</p><p><strong>* US PCE: </strong>The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, Core PCE, came in on the soft side for the month of October; on a M/M basis, prices grew by 0.1%, in line with expectations, however the Y/Y reading slipped to 1.6% from 1.7%, below expectations for the rate of inflation to remain unchanged, although this was largely “thanks to rounding”, notes Pantheon Macroeconomics. “The core deflator remains subdued both in M/M and Y/Y terms”, observes the consultancy, adding that “it’s too early to expect to see any impact from the tariffs on consumer goods” which were added on September 1. Pantheon play down the importance of a 2.5% decline in the prices of clothing, citing ongoing methodological changes in capturing the data. They do however flag solid price gains in healthcare services, which grew 0.3% in October and at a Y/Y rate of 2.8%, which is a six-year high. “This is potentially important” caution the consultancy, “because healthcare services account for some 17% of the core PCE, so a sustained acceleration could make a material difference to the inflation picture.” Elsewhere, Personal Income for the month of October was stagnant, a miss on expectations for a 0.3% rise, with all the unexpected softness due to the “wildly volatile” farm component and the “less-wild but still noisy” interest income component, according to Pantheon. However, due to the 0.4% rise in core wages and salary income, which is in line with the recent trend, Pantheon advises that the drop-in income should largely be ignored. More concerning, the consultancy notes, is the softness in spending growth; Real Consumption growth grew at 0.1% in October, the softest reading since February. Pantheon point to the slowing trend in consumption growth; even if November and December consumption come in strong, Q4 consumption growth is likely to slow to 2%, they say, down from 2.9% in Q3 and 4.6% in Q2. “The market and media narrative about consumers driving the economy likely is going to require a tweak” they conclude.</p><p><strong>*US DURABLE GOODS</strong>: US Durable Goods orders for the month of October surprised to the upside, with the headline figure growing at a rate of 0.6% Y/Y compared to expectations for a 0.8% contraction. October’s reading also rebounded somewhat from the prior month’s -1.4% reading, which was revised lower from -1.2%. Similarly, the Core measure (excludes transport items) and the non-defence ex-aircraft subcomponents were also stronger than forecast; the former came in at 0.6% vs expectations for 0.1%, up from last month’s -0.4% print and the latter came in at 1.2% vs expectations for -0.3%, up from last month’s -0.5% reading. “The October durable goods report offers further hints that manufacturing activity is beginning to stabilize” says Wells Fargo, highlighting a 10.7% increase in aircraft orders as supportive to the headline beat. The desk writes “more telling, however, was the 1.2% increase in core capital goods orders” adding that “equipment spending in Q4 is off to a good start and looks poised for a rebound after declining in Q3”. However, the bank expects capex to remain lacklustre in the near-term, with core orders down over the past three months and regional PMIs for November showing that orders remained weak.</p><p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI: </strong>Chicago PMI rose to 46.3 in October from 43.2, missing expectations for a rise to 47.0. “The October reading always looked too bad to be true, perhaps due in part to the GM strike” Pantheon comments, “so this rebound is no surprise.” PM cites two negatives still putting the index under pressure; Boeing’s ongoing troubles and continued trade related uncertainty. Looking ahead to next week’s ISM manufacturing index, the consultancy notes that the regional surveys have been a “mixed bag”. Accordingly, Pantheon looks for next week’s official reading to be largely unchanged from last month’s 48.3 reading.</p><p><strong>* CHINA INDUSTRIAL PROFITS:</strong> NBS data overnight showed profits at Chinese industrial companies falling for the third consecutive month, with the pace now at -9% Y/Y despite supportive base effects for the month. However, ING's analysts note a significant divergence on profitability between infrastructure-related manufacturers and those related to trade; profits in infrastructure related industries look healthy: Mining of ferrous metals +189.5% Y/Y YTD, mining activities +154.9%, and railway, ship, aerospace and other transportation equipment manufacturing +131.1%. Weakness is sponsored by Chemical fibre manufacturing (-26.3% Y/Y YTD), the paper industry (-17.0%), automotive (-14.7%), and textile industry (-6.4%). \"This divergence of profitability among different industries will remain until there are big improvements in the trade negotiations,\" ING writes, \"and we will gauge this on the degree of tariff rollbacks.\"</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTIONS: </strong>After market today (10pm local), pollster YouGov will publish its \"multi-level regression and poststratification\" model forecasting what the seat split will look like after the UK General Election; traders will give the model added focus given it predicted the hung parliament at the last elections.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>There were little to no trade updates throughout the overnight session, apart from US President Trump reiterating his stance for the US to get a favourable deal, and thus holding up the deal to ensure it is what he wants. However, WSJ’s Wei announced her sources told her that there is a major push to get a deal done and that both sides are finalising the text of a Phase One agreement.</p><p><strong>* USMCA: </strong>USMCA will reportedly come to the floor for a vote next week at a minimum and could pass the week after, according to FBN’s Bartiromo citing sources. The three sides are to remain in discussions tonight, whilst also meeting again on Friday. Although Mexico and Canada both highlighted progresses has been made.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> After market today (10pm local), pollster YouGov will publish its \"multi-level regression and poststratification\" model forecasting what the seat split will look like after the UK General Election; traders will give the model added focus given it predicted the hung parliament at the last elections. The Guardian suggested the poll shows a significant Conservative majority, citing sources, although did note the margin is narrowing. In the tailend of the session, another journalist citing sources suggested Labour are predicted to receive 211 seats from the MRP.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 10 TICKS LOWER AT 129-12. </strong>The T-Note sold off modestly on Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday (lighter volumes), the selling pressures extended after the upside surprise to US GDP, providing some relief to investors’ outlook on the economy (GDP trackers were also revised higher after durable goods data, with Atlanta Fed now tracking 1.7% in Q4 vs 0.4% previously). The strong 7-year auction failed to provide a meaningful bid too, where the US sold USD 32bln of 7-year paper on the screws, with above average takedown from foreign bidders and B/C ratio, whilst dealers took less than average. The curve, in fact, bear flattened on the day, where despite a less-than-rosy PCE release, the front-end was sold the most (NOTE: the Fed has expressed its unwillingness to raise rates until inflation is comfortably above its 2% target, however). The 2s10s fell by around 1.5bps, flirting with the 14bps support level, whilst the 2s30s fell by just shy of 3bps; the 2-year yield settled 4bps higher.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLES USD 0.30 LOWER AT USD 58.11/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.20 LOWER AT USD 63.01/BBL</strong>. Crude benchmarks were already drifting lower from their highs as US participants emerged on Wednesday, before the bearish API report was confirmed by the EIA, seeing prices leg lower, although there was some paring prior to settlement. The EIA reported a surprise build in crude stocks by 1.57mln bbls (slightly less severe than the +3.6mln API report), with Cushing drawing 0.1mln bbls, distillates building 0.73mln bbls, as expected, and gasoline stocks building 5.1mln bbls, significantly more than expected. Meanwhile, production rose to another new record high of 12.9mln BPD, refining utilisation decreased by 0.2% (exp. +1.0%) and net imports fell by 236k BPD to 2.71mln BPD, with the rise in exports larger than the rise in imports. Despite record high production, the amount of active US drillers continued to decline with Baker Hughes’ latest rig count recording a record 12-month consecutive cut: oil rigs -3 at 668, nat gas rigs +2 at 131, total rigs -1 at 802; note the weekly rig count was released early due to the US Thanksgiving holiday. Elsewhere, Exxon (XOM) Beaumont refinery in Texas (366K BPD) reported a leak on a pipe which resulted in a material release and suggested some impact to production; Libya’s 70k BPD El Feel oilfield has had production shut in due to airstrikes, an NOC statement said; Russian Energy Minister said adjusting oil output cut quotas is to be discussed at the next OPEC+ meeting on December 6th, TASS reported.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 3154, NASDAQ-100 0.7% at 8445, Dow Jones 0.2% at 28164</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.8%, Consumer Staples 0.1%, Energy 0.3%, Financials 0.4%, Health Care 0.5%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology 0.6%, Materials 0.2%, Telecommunication Services 0.6%, Utilities 0.1%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Deere (DE) posted an above expectations quarter but disappointed on FY20 guidance, alluding to wider, systemic risks to agriculture and construction, which weighed on competitors such as Caterpillar (CAT). VMWare (VMW) opened higher on beating estimates for the quarter and raising FY20 profit guidance, before reversing course, perhaps as participants weighed margin pressure from the Pivotal acquisition, which is forecasted to hit its profit next quarter. Autodesk (ADSK) and Keysight Technologies (KEYS) surged on strong quarters and guidance. HP Inc. (HPQ) beat on top and bottom line, in addition to decent guidance, opening higher but fading into the red throughout the session, with some noting its reluctance to the Xerox (XRX) offer taking off some of the stock’s premium on hopes of a buyout. Dell Technologies (DELL) took a haircut after a revenue miss and cutting revenue guidance. Veeva Systems (VEEV) also reversed its leg open after a stellar earnings report and guidance, with little explanation for the sell-off.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Under Armour (UAA) surged after being upgraded to Strong Buy at Raymond James, citing favourable risk/return. Tesla (TSLA) faded initial gains spurred by Elon Musk tweeting that Cybertruck orders had reached 250k. Tapestry (TPR) and Capri Holdings (CPRI) were firmer after being mentioned at Citi as potential acquisition targets of the hungry PVH Corp (PVH), whose stock traded lower. Bristol Myers (BMY) was supported by a Buy initiation at Gabelli. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) suffered on weaker metals prices.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD traded firmer today catching an initial bid on a strong data (Durable goods &amp; Q3 GDP). DXY continued its rally from lows of 98.259 to print highs of 98.44, with participants eyeing 98.50 as the next level of psychological resistance, a level it failed to test as a softer Oct. PCE and Chicago PMI put a cap on dollar gains. Havens were weaker today on the initial promising data, which saw JPY the underperforming haven as it broke 109.20, a level of resistance it tested multiple times in the morning, on the 09:30 ET data. USDJPY continued upwards throughout the session, with rate differentials also likely playing a factor. XAU also lower today, with Dollar strength providing a headwind for the precious metal. XAU traded in a 9-buck grange from highs of 1461 in the morning, to lows of 1452 around midday ET, a level it remains just higher than heading into Asia trade. CHF also weaker against FX counterparts although marginally flat against the Euro. Antipodes were slightly weaker on Wednesday, with AUD hit after a dovish forecast from Westpac who expect 50bps of easing by June and to then start QE in H2 2020. NZD initially saw some gains on its FSR last night, however Dollar strength today put the Kiwi marginally weaker against the buck, whilst the AUDNZD cross was relatively flat heading into the Asia-Pac session. GBP a strong performer today, with source reports suggesting the upcoming YouGov MRP poll, released at 17:00 ET / 22:00 GMT tonight, will show a significant Conservative majority which sent Cable marginally above the 1.29 handle. EUR traded weaker today as the single currency flirted around the 1.10 handle throughout the majority of the session, with large Op-Ex likely playing a roll, where 2bln rolled off between 1.0995 and 1.10, a level it resided around at the NY cut. EMFX was generally weaker with the exception of the Rand which was stronger against the dollar today. BRL the underperformer yet again as USDBRL tested fresh record lows, although the BCB reportedly intervened once again to stem Real weakness before it could be reached. MXN traded relatively rangebound mainly taking direction from USD strength as the Peso shrugged off Banxico’s latest QIR which cut GDP and inflation forecasts, whilst participants eye any meaningful USMCA updates.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ FSR:</strong> UBS notes that the one key element that the FSR report highlighted was growing financial asymmetries: the RBNZ indicated that low interest rates may mitigate financial stability risks in the short term, but could increase vulnerabilities, which resulted in a knee-jerk reaction in NZD, which UBS said was a sign that the market was taking the prospect of less of an appetite from the RBNZ to cut rates further as a positive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The EIA reported a surprise build in crude stocks by 1.57mln bbls (slightly less severe than the +3.6mln API report), with Cushing drawing 0.1mln bbls, distillates building 0.73mln bbls, as expected, and gasoline stocks building 5.1mln bbls, significantly more than expected. Meanwhile, production rose to another new record high of 12.9mln BPD, refining utilisation decreased by 0.2% (exp. +1.0%) and net imports fell by 236k BPD to 2.71mln BPD, with the rise in exports larger than the rise in imports. Despite record high production, the amount of active US drillers continued to decline with Baker Hughes’ latest rig count recording a record 12-month consecutive cut: oil rigs -3 at 668, nat gas rigs +2 at 131, total rigs -1 at 802; note the weekly rig count was released early due to the US Thanksgiving holiday. Elsewhere, Exxon (XOM) Beaumont refinery in Texas (366K BPD) reported a leak on a pipe which resulted in a material release and suggested some impact to production; Libya’s 70k BPD El Feel oilfield has had production shut in due to airstrikes, an NOC statement said; Russian Energy Minister said adjusting oil output cut quotas is to be discussed at the next OPEC+ meeting on December 6th, TASS reported.</li></ul>",

Usd/Jpy has now breached 109.20 Fib resistance and bounced further from 109.00 lows with little sign of the headline pair stalling around 1 bn option expiries at 109.15, while Usd/Chf inched a bit closer to par before fading and Eur/Usd briefly probed below 1.1000, also through expiry interest along with a key Fib level (between 1.0995 and the big figure and at 1.0994 respectively).</p><p><strong>GBP/NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but Sterling is rivalling the Scandi Kronas for best major and certainly among the most resilient currencies after rebounding firmly from worst levels prompted by month-end selling via the Eur/Gbp cross. However, the Pound pulled up ahead of 1.2900 and 0.8535 respectively in the run up to YouGov’s MRP model poll that is scheduled for release at 10 pm London time and eagerly awaited on the basis that a pre-2017 UK election survey proved to be pretty prophetic. Meanwhile, the non-US Dollars have gradually lost momentum above the 0.6400 handle, around 1.3275 and sub-0.6800 respectively, with the Kiwi unfazed by multiple NZ specific impulses overnight, the Loonie unable to extend gains beyond 1.3260 and Aussie undermined by dovish RBA outlooks.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Swedish and Norwegian Crowns have both performed well, albeit with the aid of a waning single currency, and despite some disappointing data, as Eur/Sek clears 10.5500 chart support and Eur/Nok hovers near the base of a circa 10.1180-10.10890 range on divergent Riksbank/Norges Bank vs ECB policy stances.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the likes of the Lira, Real and Rand, with the latter sharply outperforming amidst ongoing Turkish-US angst and CBRT rate cut expectations, while capital flight and contagion continues to hit Latam FX as anti-establishment protests spread from Chile to Colombia. Usd/Zar is hovering below 5.7500 in contrast to Usd/Try closer to the top of a 5.7900-7525 range and Usd/Brl not far from yesterday’s 4.2765 ATH.</p>",

Analysts at UBS say that the Treasury will give some USD 92bln in cash redemptions and coupon payments this week, implying net cash flows of around 21bln. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p>The previous two auctions have been digested well, both stopping through the screens (the last by the largest margin since the March auction); demand from investment funds and foreign bidders was strong. The 7-year part of the curve trades fair in asset swap against older 7s, SocGen says, though it trades cheap versus 5s and 10s. The current WI trades above the last three auction stop-out rates, which the bank says emphasises the cheapness of the sector on an outright basis versus the recent auction cycles. SocGen also notes that dealer holdings in the 6-7 year bucket are low, which may benefit the sale. SocGen says it is positive on the auction, but notes that the Q3 GDP data (second reading) ahead of the auction may set the tone. \"Also, it should be noted that the 7-year note auction will close early on 27 November because of the Thanksgiving holiday, and the demand for the 7-year auction might be affected because of the holiday-shortened week.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY: &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>• High-yield: (prev. 1.657%, six-auction avg. 1.797%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Tail: (prev. -0.7bps, six-auction avg. 0.7bps)&nbsp;</p><p>• Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.46x, six-auction avg. 2.35x)&nbsp;</p><p>• Dealers: (prev. 20.1%, six-auction avg. 24.9%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Direct: (prev. 14.5%, six-auction avg. 16.1%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Indirect: (prev. 65.4%, six-auction avg. 59.0%)</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.9%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.3%)</strong> were positive with notable strength in Australia’s telecoms sector as Telstra was boosted in anticipation of a stronger performance in H2 and with gold miners underpinned after the precious metal found relief from support at USD 1450/oz, while Tokyo sentiment rode on the recent upward trajectory in USD/JPY and with Toshiba lifted by prospects of a sooner return to the main market following reports the Tokyo Stock Exchange will ease requirements to fast-track promotion to the main board as soon as next year. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%)</strong> were somewhat indecisive with Hong Kong kept afloat by hopes protests were waning and that the university siege may have drawn to an end, although the mainland was choppy due to continued PBoC liquidity inaction and after Industrial Profits further deteriorated with its largest decline since 2011. Finally, 10yr JGBs ignored the mostly positive tone in stocks and extended on the prior day’s post-40yr auction rebound to briefly test resistance at the 153.50 level, with prices also supported by the BoJ’s presence in the market today with the central bank’s Rinban operations heavily concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Meanwhile, month-end factors continue to distort price-action. Sectors are in the green across the board, with outperformance seen in Materials (+0.3%) and Consumer Discretionary (+0.3%). In terms of individual movers; British American Tobacco (+2.1%) nursed losses seen at the open after the Co. noted that it is on track for a strong year despite a slowdown in the US vaping market. Elsewhere today’s notable gainers include Aroundtown Properties (+2.5%) whose shares advanced after the Co. posted strong gains in both revenue and EBITDA. In terms of the laggards, Knorr Bremse (-3.5%) is under pressure after the Co. posted earnings that missed on top line expectations. Meanwhile, Rolls Royce (-1.5%) and Compass Group (-2.5%) are both lower following downgrades at Morgan Stanley and SocGen respectively. Taking a broader view, Barclays continue to see moderate upside for European equity markets in 2020, forecasting a further 9% of upside for the Euro Stoxx 50 by next year’s end. Although “the tactical risk-reward has become less appealing following the latest rally, as macro recovery and reducing policy uncertainty appear to be widely expected… light positioning, the relative expensiveness of ‘safe assets’, the positive delta in activity &amp; earnings and the easier financial conditions argue for an extension of the equity bull market into 2020” the bank concludes.</p><p><strong>Deere &amp; Co (DE) </strong>Q3 19 (USD): EPS 2.14 (exp. 2.14), Revenue 8.7bln (exp. 8.55bln).

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar remains on a firm footing ahead of a packed US agenda with data front loaded and compressed due to Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday. The Greenback is up vs most G10 rivals, albeit rangebound as the DXY meanders between 98.407-259 parameters, and just shy of resistance at 98.450. Back to today’s raft of releases, Q3 GDP and October core PCE are likely to headline, but durable goods may steal the limelight given the erratic nature of that series.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/SEK/NOK - </strong>The major outliers and ‘outperformers’, as the Loonie maintains a degree of bullish technical momentum after Usd/Cad closed below the 200 DMA on Tuesday (1.3278) and the Kiwi benefits from favourable cross-winds with Aud/Nzd pivoting 1.0550 and Nzd/Usd holding relatively firmly above 0.6400 having largely shrugged off or taken in stride comments from RBNZ Governor Orr, the latest FSR and NZ trade data. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns have not really sustained serious or lasting damage from a dip in Swedish household lending, flip from trade surplus to a deficit twice the size or rise in the unofficial Norwegian survey-based jobless rate, as Eur/Sek tests support at 10.5500 and Eur/Nok straddles 10.1000.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/JPY/CHF/EUR - </strong>The Pound has recovered pretty well if not impressively from early weakness and a breach of yesterday’s low (circa 1.2835) that seemed partly Eur/Gbp related amidst reports of RHS demand for the end of November. Indeed, Cable has bounced ahead of last Friday’s base (around 1.2822) towards 1.2885 and eclipsing the 21 DMA (1.2881) and the cross is back near 0.8650 having climbed to within a few pips of its 21 DMA (0.8587), as Eur/Usd hovers just above 1.1000. Note, hefty options expire close by (2 bn from 1.0995-1.1000 and 1.1 bn between 1.1035-40), while a key Fib (1.0994) is also keeping the single currency in narrow confines. Elsewhere, broadly risk-on sentiment amidst latest positive US-China trade chat (phase 1 deal in final throes per President Trump) is capping the Yen and Franc just under 109.00 and over parity respectively, with expiry interest also in proximity for Usd/Jpy (3.3 bn from 108.95-109.00 and 1 bn at 109.15). Back down under, a couple of dovish RBA calls vs 1 less dovish has weighed on Aud/Usd and protected a serious approach on 0.6800, but the pair is holding above 1bn expiries between 0.6760-75.</p><p><strong>Large FX Expiries, NY Cut</strong>:</p><p>- EUR/USD: <strong>1.0995-1.1000 (2BLN),</strong> 1.1010 (320M), <strong>1.1035-40 (1.1BLN),</strong> 1.1050 (684M), 1.1100 (500M)</p><p>- GBP/USD: 1.2700 (1.1BLN), 1.2800 (335M), <strong>1.2845-60 (1.1BLN),</strong> 1.2900 (315M)</p><p>- AUD/USD<strong>: 0.6760-75 (1BLN),</strong> 0.6830-40 (750M), 0.6850-60 (1BLN)</p><p>- USD/JPY: 108.45-55 (1.9BLN), 108.65-75 (1.7BLN), <strong>108.95-109.00 (3.3BLN), 109.15 (1BLN),</strong> 109.50 (800M)</p><p>Citi no longer expects RBA to deploy QE next year and noted recent comments from RBA Governor Lowe which suggests 0.25% is the effective lower bound for rates. Conversely, Westpac forecasts RBA to lower rates to 0.25% by June 2020 and start QE in H2 2020, while RBC sees the RBA cutting rates to 0.25% in 2021 and to begin QE that year also. (Newswires)</p><p>RBNZ Financial Stability Report noted that New Zealand’s financial system is resilient to a range of economic risks although global financial stability risks and domestic debt vulnerabilities remain, while it added that prolonged low long-term interest rates could generate excess leverage and overheated asset prices. Furthermore, the RBNZ stated negative OCR is not currently a central scenario in its published forecasts and it is considering potential impacts of unconventional monetary policy tools on bank profitability. (Newswires)</p><p>RBNZ Governor Orr said low rates are needed to achieve targets but added that persistently lower global rates bring about challenges, while he also stated they were not particularly close to loosening LVR rules and need to get more confident around bank lending behaviour before considering loosening LVRs.

Looking ahead, attention will be on EIA inventory data, where weekly crude stocks are seen drawing by 347k barrels, although if EIA crude stocks follow API’s lead and print a surprise build, this would mark a fifth straight week of builds. It is also the first day of the OPEC Economic Commission Board Meeting, which ends tomorrow, after which the board may provide policy recommendations to OPEC - although the recommendations are non-binding.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Major European bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%) are higher in quiet but choppy trade, as global equities continue to build on recent momentum amid elevated trade hopes since the latest US President Trump comments that trade talks are in the “final throes”. Meanwhile, month-end factors continue to distort price-action. Sectors are in the green across the board, with outperformance seen in Materials (+0.3%) and Consumer Discretionary (+0.3%). In terms of individual movers; British American Tobacco (+2.1%) nursed losses seen at the open after the Co. noted that it is on track for a strong year despite a slowdown in the US vaping market. Elsewhere today’s notable gainers include Aroundtown Properties (+2.5%) whose shares advanced after the Co. posted strong gains in both revenue and EBITDA. In terms of the laggards, Knorr Bremse (-3.5%) is under pressure after the Co. posted earnings that missed on top line expectations. Meanwhile, Rolls Royce (-1.5%) and Compass Group (-2.5%) are both lower following downgrades at Morgan Stanley and SocGen respectively. Taking a broader view, Barclays continue to see moderate upside for European equity markets in 2020, forecasting a further 9% of upside for the Euro Stoxx 50 by next year’s end. Although “the tactical risk-reward has become less appealing following the latest rally, as macro recovery and reducing policy uncertainty appear to be widely expected… light positioning, the relative expensiveness of ‘safe assets’, the positive delta in activity &amp; earnings and the easier financial conditions argue for an extension of the equity bull market into 2020” the bank concludes.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar remains on a firm footing ahead of a packed US agenda with data front loaded and compressed due to Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday. The Greenback is up vs most G10 rivals, albeit rangebound as the DXY meanders between 98.407-259 parameters, and just shy of resistance at 98.450. Back to today’s raft of releases, Q3 GDP and October core PCE are likely to headline, but durable goods may steal the limelight given the erratic nature of that series.</p><p>CAD/NZD/SEK/NOK - The major outliers and ‘outperformers’, as the Loonie maintains a degree of bullish technical momentum after Usd/Cad closed below the 200 DMA on Tuesday (1.3278) and the Kiwi benefits from favourable cross-winds with Aud/Nzd pivoting 1.0550 and Nzd/Usd holding relatively firmly above 0.6400 having largely shrugged off or taken in stride comments from RBNZ Governor Orr, the latest FSR and NZ trade data. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns have not really sustained serious or lasting damage from a dip in Swedish household lending, flip from trade surplus to a deficit twice the size or rise in the unofficial Norwegian survey-based jobless rate, as Eur/Sek tests support at 10.5500 and Eur/Nok straddles 10.1000.</p><p>GBP/AUD/JPY/CHF/EUR - The Pound has recovered pretty well if not impressively from early weakness and a breach of yesterday’s low (circa 1.2835) that seemed partly Eur/Gbp related amidst reports of RHS demand for the end of November. Indeed, Cable has bounced ahead of last Friday’s base (around 1.2822) towards 1.2885 and eclipsing the 21 DMA (1.2881) and the cross is back near 0.8650 having climbed to within a few pips of its 21 DMA (0.8587), as Eur/Usd hovers just above 1.1000. Note, hefty options expire close by (2 bn from 1.0995-1.1000 and 1.1 bn between 1.1035-40), while a key Fib (1.0994) is also keeping the single currency in narrow confines. Elsewhere, broadly risk-on sentiment amidst latest positive US-China trade chat (phase 1 deal in final throes per President Trump) is capping the Yen and Franc just under 109.00 and over parity respectively, with expiry interest also in proximity for Usd/Jpy (3.3 bn from 108.95-109.00 and 1 bn at 109.15). Back down under, a couple of dovish RBA calls vs 1 less dovish has weighed on Aud/Usd and protected a serious approach on 0.6800, but the pair is holding above 1bn expiries between 0.6760-75.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Not much further price action of range extension in core bonds, but <strong>Gilts</strong> have recently slipped to a fresh Liffe intraday trough (132.41) after yesterday’s upturn on heightened hung parliament risks/hedging in contrast to soft, though steadier <strong>Bunds</strong> <strong>and US Treasuries</strong> following a solid German 5 year auction and an extra busy pm session across the Atlantic (including multiple data points and the Fed’s latest Beige Book) given tomorrow’s US holiday and a final session of the week/month that is also likely to be low key due to those still celebrating or suffering the effects of Thanksgiving excesses. Note also, the last of this week’s T-note auctions awaits in the form of Usd32 bn 7 year paper and normally receives decent sponsorship from foreign buyers.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The crude complex is slightly firmer, with <strong>Brent</strong> Feb’ 20 futures making fresh weekly highs above yesterday’s high (around USD 64.30/bbl) , as the market rebounds from overnight post bearish API inventory data lows as it opts to instead take its cue from better risk appetite spurred by trade hopes. Looking ahead, attention will be on EIA inventory data, where weekly crude stocks are seen drawing by 347k barrels, although if EIA crude stocks follow API’s lead and print a surprise build, this would mark a fifth straight week of builds. It is also the first day of the OPEC Economic Commission Board Meeting, which ends tomorrow, after which the board may provide policy recommendations to OPEC - although the recommendations are non-binding. Elsewhere, eyes turn to Libya following reports of military action around the El-Feel oilfield (circa. 100k BPD capacity), although no damage or production halts have been reported, the organisation stated that an escalation in violence could prompt evacuations and production shut-down. Looking at metals, <strong>gold</strong> prices continue to be subdued from lack of haven demand, with prices having briefly slipped below the USD 1460/oz mark. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices continue to gain traction, as positive trade feels spur macro risk appetite, although prices did take a fleeting hit during overnight trade in the wake of abysmal IP data out of China.</p>",

Back to today’s raft of releases, Q3 GDP and October core PCE are likely to headline, but durable goods may steal the limelight given the erratic nature of that series.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The major outliers and ‘outperformers’, as the Loonie maintains a degree of bullish technical momentum after Usd/Cad closed below the 200 DMA on Tuesday (1.3278) and the Kiwi benefits from favourable cross-winds with Aud/Nzd pivoting 1.0550 and Nzd/Usd holding relatively firmly above 0.6400 having largely shrugged off or taken in stride comments from RBNZ Governor Orr, the latest FSR and NZ trade data. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns have not really sustained serious or lasting damage from a dip in Swedish household lending, flip from trade surplus to a deficit twice the size or rise in the unofficial Norwegian survey-based jobless rate, as Eur/Sek tests support at 10.5500 and Eur/Nok straddles 10.1000.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound has recovered pretty well if not impressively from early weakness and a breach of yesterday’s low (circa 1.2835) that seemed partly Eur/Gbp related amidst reports of RHS demand for the end of November. Indeed, Cable has bounced ahead of last Friday’s base (around 1.2822) towards 1.2885 and eclipsing the 21 DMA (1.2881) and the cross is back near 0.8650 having climbed to within a few pips of its 21 DMA (0.8587), as Eur/Usd hovers just above 1.1000. Note, hefty options expire close by (2 bn from 1.0995-1.1000 and 1.1 bn between 1.1035-40), while a key Fib (1.0994) is also keeping the single currency in narrow confines. Elsewhere, broadly risk-on sentiment amidst latest positive US-China trade chat (phase 1 deal in final throes per President Trump) is capping the Yen and Franc just under 109.00 and over parity respectively, with expiry interest also in proximity for Usd/Jpy (3.3 bn from 108.95-109.00 and 1 bn at 109.15). Back down under, a couple of dovish RBA calls vs 1 less dovish has weighed on Aud/Usd and protected a serious approach on 0.6800, but the pair is holding above 1bn expiries between 0.6760-75.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was propped up by another record setting session for Wall Street, while antipodeans were steady for most the session after an uneventful RBNZ Financial Stability Report, relatively inline Exports/Imports data from New Zealand and recent comments from RBA Governor Lowe who pushed back on the notion of QE and reiterated that negative rates are extremely unlikely. However, <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was then pressured in late trade following a fiercely dovish forecast by Westpac for the RBA to lower rates to 0.25% from current 0.75% by June and begin QE in H2 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Citi no longer expects RBA to deploy QE next year and noted recent comments from RBA Governor Lowe which suggests 0.25% is the effective lower bound for rates.

Nonetheless, oil prices were contained overnight with mild pressure seen following a surprise build in API crude inventories which forced a brief pullback in February Brent Crude futures to test support at the USD 63.00/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> consolidated from the prior session’s bout of volatility where the precious metal momentarily attempted a breakdown of USD 1450/oz with overnight price action restricted by a slightly firmer USD, while <strong>copper</strong> saw some profit taking amid the indecision in China after the worst slump in its Industrial Profits since 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (26 Nov) +3.6mln vs. Exp. -0.4mln (Prev. +6.0mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX found modest support through the session amid the ongoing month-end inflows. Similar to yesterday, the large Treasury issuance and appetite for equities is failing to see a deterioration in US sovereign debt demand – meanwhile there has been little material US-China trade updates. The US sold USD 41bln of 5-year notes at 1.587%, in what was a rather average auction, tailing the WI by 0.3bps and below average domestic demand, although the B/C ratio of 2.5x was above average and the strong international demand saw dealers take less than usual. At settlement, the Treasury curve was slightly flatter, with the 30-year yield down 3bps and the 2-year yield was down slightly under 2bps.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly higher after Wall Street extended on record levels once again, but with gains capped given the lack of material breakthrough from the recent slew of optimistic US-China trade rhetoric and following a further slump in Chinese Industrial Profits. ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were positive with notable strength in Australia’s telecoms sector as Telstra was boosted in anticipation of a stronger performance in H2 and with gold miners underpinned after the precious metal found relief from support at USD 1450/oz, while Tokyo sentiment rode on the recent upward trajectory in USD/JPY and with Toshiba lifted by prospects of a sooner return to the main market following reports the Tokyo Stock Exchange will ease requirements to fast-track promotion to the main board as soon as next year. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were somewhat indecisive with Hong Kong kept afloat by hopes protests were waning and that the university siege may have drawn to an end, although the mainland was choppy due to continued PBoC liquidity inaction and after Industrial Profits further deteriorated with its largest decline since 2011. Finally, 10yr JGBs ignored the mostly positive tone in stocks and extended on the prior day’s post-40yr auction rebound to briefly test resistance at the 153.50 level, with prices also supported by the BoJ’s presence in the market today with the central bank’s Rinban operations heavily concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher after Wall St. extended on record levels once again, but with gains capped given the lack of material breakthrough from the recent slew of optimistic US-China trade rhetoric and following a further slump in Chinese Industrial Profits. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are positive with telecoms front-running the gains in Australia as Telstra is boosted in anticipation of a stronger performance in H2 and with gold miners underpinned after the precious metal found relief from support at USD 1450/oz, while Tokyo sentiment rides on the recent upward trajectory in USD/JPY and with Toshiba lifted by hopes of a sooner return to the main market following reports the Tokyo Stock Exchange will ease requirements to fast-track promotion to the main board as soon as next year. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are somewhat indecisive with Hong Kong kept afloat by hopes protests are waning and the university siege could be drawing to an end, although the mainland was choppy due to continued PBoC liquidity inaction and after Industrial Profits further deteriorated with its largest decline since 2011.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly higher overnight but remains within the prior day’s range where price action was choppy heading into month-end and amid the holiday-shortened week for US Thanksgiving Day, while the latest Fed rhetoric from Brainard and Kaplan backed the neutrality concept with the latter reiterating the view that current policy is in the right place. EUR/USD remains indecisive after the recent choppy price action and has reverted to yesterday’s overnight range, a tad north of the 1.1000 level where there is significant option expiry of EUR 1.1bln for today’s New York cut, and GBP/USD languishes around 1.2850 following the latest YouGov and Kantar polls which both showed a narrowing lead for the Conservatives. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was propped up by another record setting session for Wall Street, while antipodeans are steady after an uneventful RBNZ Financial Stability Report, relatively inline Exports/Imports data from New Zealand and recent comments from RBA Governor Lowe who dismissed the notion of QE and reiterated that negative rates are extremely unlikely.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs have ignored the positive tone in Japanese stocks and extend on the prior day’s post-40yr auction rebound to briefly test resistance at the 153.50 level, with prices also supported by the BoJ’s presence in the market today with the bank heavily concentrated on 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
