        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 4 Jan 2019: Stocks rally after blockbuster NFP and dovish Powell",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, treasuries down, dollar down, crude up.<br />* REAR-VIEW: US and China to resume trade talks 7-8 Jan, NFP gigantic beat adding 312k jobs, Fed&#39;s Powell says Fed watching data &amp; not on pre-set course, Trump to keep govt shut until funding bill.<br />* NEXT WEEK: FOMC Minutes, BoC Interest Rate Decision, Riksbank Minutes, ECB Minutes, UK Parliament Returns, US CPI, UK GDP, US ISM non-Mfg PMIs, Eurozone Unemployment Rate, China CPI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<p><strong>* NON-FARM PAYROLLS </strong>widely exceeded expectations, adding 312k jobs in December compared to the ~180k consensus; the prior release was also upwardly revised to 176k from 155k. Wages rose 0.4% last month, enough to keep the annual rate unchanged at 3.2%, at the highest since 2009. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate rose a tad, to 3.9% from 3.7%, amid a rise in the participation rate which came in at 63.1%. Analysts at ING said &ldquo;this really positive report should certainly ease creeping fears in the market that the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates&rdquo; but warn at the same time that growing risks, including fading fiscal stimulus, a strong USD, and weaker external demand amid uncertainty in the trade war with China, exist and may contribute to worries that &ldquo;such strength is sustainable&rdquo;. Looking ahead, ING argues that payrolls will slow this year, below the 220k average seen this year, while wages will continue to rise; this reflects a lack of labour force supply rather than a fall in demand as competition amongst skilled workers intensifies pushing job compensations higher.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL </strong>once again reiterated that FOMC policy is not on a pre-set path, and that the Fed will be patient in watching data and are prepared to adjust policy stance. Powell said that amid mixed signals, Fed policy would be about risk management. Crucially, Powell impressed that the Fed is always prepared to shift its stance on policy, and could do so quickly if required, adding that if the Fed concluded that its balance sheet run off was causing problems, it could revisit its plans. On the economy, he argued that most data remain solid, and was encouraged by today&rsquo;s jobs report; while strength can be seen in consumer spending, Powell noted the latest ISM report had come off historically elevated levels, and said the reading was now consistent with moderate growth; he did not appear overly concerned about too strong inflation. On international markets, he warned that Chinese consumers appear to be pulling back, and Chinese weakness seems to be spilling over into other nations with markets sending warnings about downside risk. With regards to his relationship with US President Trump, he announced a meeting has not been scheduled and he has had no contact with the White House while making clear he would not resign if he was asked to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PBOC RRR CUT: </strong>China&#39;s central bank announced it would make a cut to its RRR ratio by 50bps on 15 January, and an additional 50bps on 25 January, with the central bank suggesting that the measures will free up around RMB 1.5trln of liquidity. The move comes after the PBOC&#39;s recently announced new Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility, as well as widening the parameters of a previous RRR cut, while also announcing that the medium-term lending facility funds that are set to mature in Q1 will not be rolled over. &quot;Taking all these measures together the PBOC estimates that the net liquidity injection will be RMB 800B,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, &quot;on our estimates, the net injection is reasonably large but not uncommon for this time of year, as the PBOC points out, suggesting that the funds will help banks to continue with their provision of funds to small and micro-sized enterprises through Chinese New Year, when demand for cash spikes.&quot; Pantheon also argues that the central bank&#39;s statements are consistent with the newly established line that monetary policy is being maintained with a prudent stance. &quot;We still see more easing in store,&quot; Pantheon writes, adding that it suspects that the loosening so far has already been enough to turn the economy around from late this year, &quot;but that is a long time for the PBOC to wait before seeing results.&quot; Looking ahead, Pantheon expects further RRR cuts, and likely a shift lower in the interest rate corridor to make the new TMLF more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR KUDLOW </strong>noted that the US will ask China to reduce subsidies. On the Fed, he made clear that details of a potential meeting between Fed&#39;s Powell and US President Trump have not been set but noted that both sides would like to meet; he once again criticised the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s inflation models, suggesting that there are currently no signs of inflation. He believes the latest jobs numbers will likely lead to upper revisions in GDP forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Mester (non-voter, hawk) appeared to suggest she would be open to a pause in rate hikes depending on how the economy performs as she is constantly watching the data. She noted that guidance indicates the Fed is open to intervene if the balance sheet run-off needs adjustment and if economy deteriorates. She is of the opinion the Fed is ahead of the curve and in a really good spot, urging for patience since inflation is not running away. Finally, she highlighted that stock market jitters are driven by a lot of currents, not just Fed policy; there are downside risks to the economy, which the market is putting emphasis on. Fed&#39;s Kashkari, commenting on the latest jobs report, urged in a tweet to stop assessing&quot; whether we are at max employment by looking at the unemployment rate and EPOP (Employment to Population Ratio)&rdquo; adding that they will be aware when wage growth will reach growth levels implying an inflation rate close to 2% target. Similarly, Fed&#39;s Bostic noted that the US is at or very close to full-employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Optimism emerged on this front after China&#39;s MOFCOM confirmed that US and China are to hold vice-ministerial trade talks on January 7th-8th. Also, US senators have proposed to combat technology threats from China. US President Trump said he thinks US will make a deal with China, adding that China&rsquo;s economic weakness has put US in strong position in trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>US House Democrats overnight voted in favour of reopening the government, defying Trump&rsquo;s veto threat; note, however, that Trump is likely to prolong the government shutdown until he obtains funding for the border wall with Mexico, and said he is prepared to keep the government shut for &lsquo;months&rsquo; and maybe &lsquo;years&rsquo; if his demands are not met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.97 HIGHER AT USD 47.96/BBL; BRENT (H9) SETTLES USD 1.11 HIGHER AT USD 57.06. </strong>Crude futures were tracking overall risk sentiment in the US premarket, rising in line with equities, and then bouncing on a blockbuster NFP report, which continues to paint a picture of a healthy US economy. The more constructive risk tone was also supported by surveys this week showing a consensus expectation that OPEC crude output will slip by around 500k BPD in December. However, sentiment was dampened after the (delayed) DOE energy inventory report, which did not reflect the crude bullishness seen in the API data on Thursday (crude +7k, Cushing +0.6mln, distillates +9.5mln, gasoline +6.9mln); analysts at Citi said &quot;these product builds may be more a function of a seasonal drop in refinery shipments over the holidays than any shift in underlying consumption.&quot; Baker Hughes Rig Count (4/Jan): Oil down 8 at 877, NatGas unchanged at 198; total down 4 at 1075.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +3.4% at 2532, NDX +4.5% at 6423, DJI +3.3% at 23430. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +3.5%, Materials +4%, Industrials +3.7%, Cons Discretionary +3.4%, Cons Staples +1.9%, Healthcare +2.9%, Financials +3.3%, Tech +4.3%, Telecoms +4%, Utilities +1.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Trade sensitive semiconductors (AMD, NVDA, INTC) and other stocks (CAT, BA, MMM) pushed indices higher today. Netflix (NFLX) outperformed with thanks to an upgrade at Goldman. Apple (AAPL) pared back some of yesterday&rsquo;s selloff, supported by Citi reiterating its buy rating. GameStop (GME) opened higher after buyout firms showed bidding interest. Celgene (CELG) continued its upward trajectory from yesterday as the market digests Bristol-Myers (BMY) acquiring it. Mosaic (MOS) was another outperformer on the back of it gaining a final permit for a new phosphate mine project. Utilities was the underperforming sector as investors moved out of defensive stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H19) SETTLE 27+ TICKS LOWER AT 122-09+. </strong>Yields rose by between 7.5bps and 12bps across the curve on Friday, underpinned by a blockbuster payrolls report as well as dovish comments by Fed chair Powell. Most of the action was in the belly of the curve, which helped 2s5s widen by around 2bps on the session, leaving it around 0.5bps away from unwinding its inversion. However, other major curve spreads were tighter, notably the 5s30s part of the curve, which came in by over 5bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Despite the holiday-shortened week after the festive break, FX markets kicked the year off with a bang with the most noteworthy source of volatility emanating from the JPY flash crash. Overnight on Wednesday, in a fast-paced move, JPY gained circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY to knock USD/JPY sharply below 109.00 and breach 105.00 to the downside. The move was attributed to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions. Risk aversion had been an underpinning factor for the JPY since mid-December with dour sentiment in US equity markets leading USD/JPY firmly below its prior 112.00-114.00 range. The pace of the move was recognised by the Japanese MOF Currency Head Asakawa later in the week with the policymaker stating that he is worried about the volatile FX moves and will take steps on forex if needed. JPY thereafter conceded some ground towards the end of the week as US-Sino trade developments helped revive sentiment alongside a pick-up in the USD after a blockbuster NFP report which revealed payroll growth of 312k vs. Exp. 177k and the fastest pace of wage growth since 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Subsequently, the DXY moved back above 96.50 ahead of comments from Fed&rsquo;s Powell. The Fed Chair eventually walked the DXY back towards the lower 96.00 level after reiterating the FOMC&#39;s flexibility in adjusting policy if needed, which was in comparison to the slightly more rigid approach that some in the market felt he conveyed during the Dec press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Also fell victim to the aggressive moves in JPY as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50. As such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 to reach 21-month lows before recovering the entire move and breaching Monday&rsquo;s low of 1.2682, however, the move eventually ran out of steam amid the aforementioned USD strength on Friday. From a fundamental perspective, Brexit-related commentary began to pick-up marginally ahead of lawmakers returning to Parliament next week. Reports suggest that UK PM May will once again have to go cap in hand to the EU in order to secure more concessions after efforts by party whips to drum up support for her plan appear to be insufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>A quiet week from a macro perspective for the Eurozone, inflation metrics provided another headache for policymakers with headline Y/Y CPI printing at 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.8%. Furthermore, ING highlight that core inflation remaining at 1% shows that higher wages are still yet to translate into higher prices. The EUR proved to be more resilient to the aforementioned JPY strength with EUR/USD maintaining its 1.13-1.15 range. However, tough tests lie ahead for the multi-bloc currency as markets look to challenge the ECB&rsquo;s view that risks to the Eurozone growth outlook are broadly balanced (albeit risks are increasing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD: </strong>With a raft of market closure and holiday-thinned conditions, macro newsflow elsewhere was relatively muted. On Friday AUD/USD managed to extend its recovery above 0.7000 amid a slightly more upbeat US-Chinese trade outlook whilst also garnering some fleeting support from the PBOC&rsquo;s decision to reduce its RRR for banks by 100bps. However, the move eventually ran out of steam as the announcement was more of a targeted adjustment ahead of the Lunar New Year rather than a stimulus attempt. CAD has seen a relatively stellar start to the year alongside advances in crude markets with USD/CAD moving from a 1.36 handle to mid-1.34 levels. USD/CAD briefly spiked higher before returning to pre-announced levels in the wake of the simultaneous Canadian and US jobs report with the former showing a modest beat on the headline print, albeit, largely fuelled by part-time gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEXT WEEK: </strong>Monday: Eurozone Retail Sales &amp; Sentix Investor Confidence, US ISM non-Mfg PMIs, Japan Services PMI, UK Parliament Returns.

The more constructive risk tone was also supported by surveys this week showing a consensus expectation that OPEC crude output will slip by around 500k BPD in December. However, sentiment was dampened after the (delayed) DOE energy inventory report, which did not reflect the crude bullishness seen in the API data on Thursday (crude +7k, Cushing +0.6mln, distillates +9.5mln, gasoline +6.9mln); analysts at Citi said &quot;these product builds may be more a function of a seasonal drop in refinery shipments over the holidays than any shift in underlying consumption.&quot; Baker Hughes Rig Count (4/Jan): Oil down 8 at 877, NatGas unchanged at 198; total down 4 at 1075.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: JPY flash crash and blockbuster NFP spurs price action in early 2019 trade",
        "content": "<p>Despite the holiday-shortened week after the festive break, FX markets kicked the year off with a bang with the most noteworthy source of volatility emanating from the JPY flash crash. Overnight on Wednesday, in a fast-paced move, JPY gained circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY to knock USD/JPY sharply below 109.00 and breach 105.00 to the downside. The move was attributed to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions. Risk aversion had been an underpinning factor for the JPY since mid-December with dour sentiment in US equity markets leading USD/JPY firmly below its prior 112.00-114.00 range. The pace of the move was recognised by the Japanese MOF Currency Head Asakawa later in the week with the policymaker stating that he is worried about the volatile FX moves and will take steps on forex if needed. JPY thereafter conceded some ground towards the end of the week as US-Sino trade developments helped revive sentiment alongside a pick-up in the USD after a blockbuster NFP report which revealed payroll growth of 312k vs. Exp. 177k and the fastest pace of wage growth since 2009. Subsequently, the DXY moved back above 96.50 ahead of comments from Fed&rsquo;s Powell. The Fed Chair eventually walked the DXY back towards the lower 96.00 level after reiterating the FOMC&#39;s flexibility in adjusting policy if needed, which was in comparison to the slightly more rigid approach that some in the market felt he conveyed during the Dec press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP also fell victim to the aggressive moves in JPY as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50. As such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 to reach 21-month lows before recovering the entire move and breaching Monday&rsquo;s low of 1.2682, however, the move eventually ran out of steam amid the aforementioned USD strength on Friday. From a fundamental perspective, Brexit-related commentary began to pick-up marginally ahead of lawmakers returning to Parliament next week. Reports suggest that UK PM May will once again have to go cap in hand to the EU in order to secure more concessions after efforts by party whips to drum up support for her plan appear to be insufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quiet week from a macro perspective for the Eurozone, inflation metrics provided another headache for policymakers with headline Y/Y CPI printing at 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.8%. Furthermore, ING highlight that core inflation remaining at 1% shows that higher wages are still yet to translate into higher prices. The EUR proved to be more resilient to the aforementioned JPY strength with EUR/USD maintaining its 1.13-1.15 range. However, tough tests lie ahead for the multi-bloc currency as markets look to challenge the ECB&rsquo;s view that risks to the Eurozone growth outlook are broadly balanced (albeit risks are increasing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a raft of market closure and holiday-thinned conditions, macro newsflow elsewhere was relatively muted. On Friday AUD/USD managed to extend its recovery above 0.7000 amid a slightly more upbeat US-Chinese trade outlook whilst also garnering some fleeting support from the PBOC&rsquo;s decision to reduce its RRR for banks by 100bps. However, the move eventually ran out of steam as the announcement was more of a targeted adjustment ahead of the Lunar New Year rather than a stimulus attempt. CAD has seen a relatively stellar start to the year alongside advances in crude markets with USD/CAD moving from a 1.36 handle to mid-1.34 levels. USD/CAD briefly spiked higher before returning to pre-announced levels in the wake of the simultaneous Canadian and US jobs report with the former showing a modest beat on the headline print, albeit, largely fuelled by part-time gains.</p>\r\n",

All sectors, including the aforementioned healthcare sector, are in the green with outperformance seen in materials on the back of positive China trade developments. Mining names such as Thyssenkrupp (+3.5%) and Anglo American (+2.8%) sit towards the top of the Stoxx 600. Other notable stories include BMW (+1.6%) and Volkswagen (+1.3%) who are up after reporting increased US December vehicles sales of +0.3% and +5.0% respectively. Elsewhere, Bayer (+3.3%) are higher after the federal judge overseeing lawsuits alleging that their glyphosate-based weed killer causes cancer has granted the Co&rsquo;s request to split the upcoming trial into two phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action for FX markets thus far has been significantly more orderly than the JPY-inspired volatility seen on late Wednesday as traders await key macro and central bank updates. Starting with the JPY, the Japanese currency has given back some gains to its major counterparts with USD/JPY hovering around the 108.00 level. The story for USD/JPY is more one of JPY weakness rather than USD strength with the DXY in negative territory, albeit still on a 96.00 handle. From a JPY perspective, Japan MOF&#39;s Currency Head Asakawa stated overnight that he is worried about the volatile FX moves and will take steps on forex if needed. Going back to the USD, given recent disappointing macro data, today&rsquo;s jobs reports from the US will be one of the more pertinent ones as of late from a Fed-perspective. Given the recent market turmoil, markets now fully price in a rate cut by April 2020 vs. the Fed&rsquo;s view of two hikes in 2019 and one hike in 2020. Amid the starkly opposing views, an out of line report could have major ramifications for the USD either way. However, with Powell speaking two hours after the release, moves in the DXY may lack some conviction as participants await the latest communication from the Fed Chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, EUR/USD has been able to capitalize on the USD weakness and retain status on a 1.1400 handle within the mid-point of its 2019 range thus far. On the data front, core EZ service PMI readings fell short of analyst estimates who had forecast unchanged readings from the prior report. This was then followed by EZ-wide inflation metrics which revealed a decline in headline CPI Y/Y to 1.6% from 1.9% vs. Exp. 1.8% but did little to place any major weight on the multi-bloc currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is exerting some strength against its major counterparts as GBP/USD continues to extend its post-flash crash ascent with the move pausing for breath after breaching Monday&rsquo;s low of 1.2682. The Pound was unable to garner much in the way of support despite a beat on the all-important Services PMI (51.2 vs. Exp. 50.7) with Markit suggesting &ldquo;The meagre service sector expansion recorded in December is indicative of the economy growing by just 0.1% in the closing quarter of 2018&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/USD has continued to extend its advance above 0.7000 with traders looking to see if the antipodean can see the week out above the psychological level and thus spur hopes for a near-term recovery. AUD was given a further helping hand briefly after the PBOC announced a 100bps cut to bank&#39;s RRR. However, the move higher will fleeting given it had already been touted by Premier Li and was seen as more of a targeted adjustment to cover the Lunar New Year period rather than an unveiling of major stimulus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/CAD is due to come into focus later in the session amid the release of the Dec Canadian jobs report with consensus looking for 5.5k jobs to be added to the economy vs. the prior +94.1k. CAD has seen a relatively stellar start to the year alongside advances in crude markets with USD/CAD moving from a 1.36 handle to mid-1.34 levels. However, given the aforementioned importance of the US jobs report, performance today for the pair will likely be driven by events stateside with the possibility of opposing simultaneous reports a key risk factor for traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt is falling after flattering Caixin services PMI and Nikkei Manufacturing PMI prints fixed sentiment alongside further positivity found in confident conversations vis-&agrave;-vis China-US trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has pressured 10-year Bund futures to lows of 164.37 with traders now eyeing the 164.01 Dec. 20th high next as support. &nbsp;The UK benchmark is seeing similar price action and taking aim at the big figure of 123.00 to the downside after printing a session low of 123.34. Some PMI data releases from the EU have failed to stop the fixed income rot, with both Germany and France missing expectations and the UK beating expectations, whilst the EZ CPI miss also failed to have an effect. BTPs are conforming to the risk-tolerant tone but have pulled back off of highs of 127.22 in recent trade to slowly revert to a 9 tick gain for the day after Italian YY CPI figures came in 50bps below the previous reading, traders remain mindful of Banca Carige developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are in the red for the day with the largest moves in the long end of the curve after 10-years hit a pinnacle and two day high of 123-07+ in the early European morning ahead of the 1st jobs report of the year, where consensus is looking for 177k payrolls added to have been added to the labor market in Dec. 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+2.2%) and WTI (+2.2%) prices are higher, with WTI trading around the USD 48.00/bbl level and Brent just above the USD 57.00/bbl level. This support comes after a larger than expected draw in API weekly crude stocks of -4.5mln vs. Exp. -3.1mln, with markets now looking towards today&rsquo;s EIA release. In addition, the Iraq oil ministry has reportedly taken measures to cut output by 3% from October&rsquo;s level of 4.653mln BPD. Elsewhere, Energy Intel&rsquo;s Amena Bakr has tweeted that Saudi Arabia are to announce a jump in oil reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.2%) has turned negative as the positive trade news from China improved the risk sentiment, with the yellow metal trading just over USD 1290/oz. Additionally, copper prices have improved on the back of positive Chinese trade news with the metal recovering from a 18-month low hit in the previous session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq are to keep their average oil output at 4.513M BPD for the next 6 months.

All sectors, including the aforementioned healthcare sector, are in the green with outperformance seen in materials on the back of positive China trade developments. Mining names such as Thyssenkrupp (+3.5%) and Anglo American (+2.8%) sit towards the top of the Stoxx 600. Other notable stories include BMW (+1.6%) and Volkswagen (+1.3%) who are up after reporting increased US December vehicles sales of +0.3% and +5.0% respectively. Elsewhere, Bayer (+3.3%) are higher after the federal judge overseeing lawsuits alleging that their glyphosate-based weed killer causes cancer has granted the Co&rsquo;s request to split the upcoming trial into two phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action for FX markets thus far has been significantly more orderly than the JPY-inspired volatility seen on late Wednesday as traders await key macro and central bank updates. Starting with the JPY, the Japanese currency has given back some gains to its major counterparts with USD/JPY hovering around the 108.00 level. The story for USD/JPY is more one of JPY weakness rather than USD strength with the DXY in negative territory, albeit still on a 96.00 handle. From a JPY perspective, Japan MOF&#39;s Currency Head Asakawa stated overnight that he is worried about the volatile FX moves and will take steps on forex if needed. Going back to the USD, given recent disappointing macro data, today&rsquo;s jobs reports from the US will be one of the more pertinent ones as of late from a Fed-perspective. Given the recent market turmoil, markets now fully price in a rate cut by April 2020 vs. the Fed&rsquo;s view of two hikes in 2019 and one hike in 2020. Amid the starkly opposing views, an out of line report could have major ramifications for the USD either way. However, with Powell speaking two hours after the release, moves in the DXY may lack some conviction as participants await the latest communication from the Fed Chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, EUR/USD has been able to capitalize on the USD weakness and retain status on a 1.1400 handle within the mid-point of its 2019 range thus far. On the data front, core EZ service PMI readings fell short of analyst estimates who had forecast unchanged readings from the prior report. This was then followed by EZ-wide inflation metrics which revealed a decline in headline CPI Y/Y to 1.6% from 1.9% vs. Exp. 1.8% but did little to place any major weight on the multi-bloc currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is exerting some strength against its major counterparts as GBP/USD continues to extend its post-flash crash ascent with the move pausing for breath after breaching Monday&rsquo;s low of 1.2682. The Pound was unable to garner much in the way of support despite a beat on the all-important Services PMI (51.2 vs. Exp. 50.7) with Markit suggesting &ldquo;The meagre service sector expansion recorded in December is indicative of the economy growing by just 0.1% in the closing quarter of 2018&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/USD has continued to extend its advance above 0.7000 with traders looking to see if the antipodean can see the week out above the psychological level and thus spur hopes for a near-term recovery. AUD was given a further helping hand briefly after the PBOC announced a 100bps cut to bank&#39;s RRR. However, the move higher will fleeting given it had already been touted by Premier Li and was seen as more of a targeted adjustment to cover the Lunar New Year period rather than an unveiling of major stimulus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/CAD is due to come into focus later in the session amid the release of the Dec Canadian jobs report with consensus looking for 5.5k jobs to be added to the economy vs. the prior +94.1k. CAD has seen a relatively stellar start to the year alongside advances in crude markets with USD/CAD moving from a 1.36 handle to mid-1.34 levels. However, given the aforementioned importance of the US jobs report, performance today for the pair will likely be driven by events stateside with the possibility of opposing simultaneous reports a key risk factor for traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt is falling after flattering Caixin services PMI and Nikkei Manufacturing PMI prints fixed sentiment alongside further positivity found in confident conversations vis-&agrave;-vis China-US trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has pressured 10-year Bund futures to lows of 164.37 with traders now eyeing the 164.01 Dec. 20th high next as support. &nbsp;The UK benchmark is seeing similar price action and taking aim at the big figure of 123.00 to the downside after printing a session low of 123.34. Some PMI data releases from the EU have failed to stop the fixed income rot, with both Germany and France missing expectations and the UK beating expectations, whilst the EZ CPI miss also failed to have an effect. BTPs are conforming to the risk-tolerant tone but have pulled back off of highs of 127.22 in recent trade to slowly revert to a 20 tick gain for the day after Italian YY CPI figures came in 50bps below the previous reading, traders remain mindful of Banca Carige developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are in the red for the day with the largest moves in the long end of the curve after 10-years hit a pinnacle and two day high of 123-07+ in the early European morning ahead of the 1st jobs report of the year, where consensus is looking for 177k payrolls added to have been added to the labor market in Dec. 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+2.0%) and WTI (+1.9%) prices are higher, with WTI trading around the USD 48.00/bbl level and Brent just above the USD 57.00/bbl level. This support comes after a larger than expected draw in API weekly crude stocks of -4.5mln vs. Exp. -3.1mln, with markets now looking towards today&rsquo;s EIA release. In addition, the Iraq oil ministry has reportedly taken measures to cut output by 3% from October&rsquo;s level of 4.653mln BPD. Elsewhere, Energy Intel&rsquo;s Amena Bakr has tweeted that Saudi Arabia are to announce a jump in oil reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.3%) has turned negative as the positive trade news from China improved the risk sentiment, with the yellow metal trading just over USD 1290/oz. Additionally, copper prices have improved on the back of positive Chinese trade news with the metal recovering from a 18-month low hit in the previous session.</p>\r\n",
