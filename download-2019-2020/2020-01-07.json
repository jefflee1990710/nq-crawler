Micron (MU) surged on an upgrade at Cowen on improving DRAM fundamentals; Western Digital (WDC) was also supported by an upgrade by the same analyst, further supporting the wide semiconductor sector (SOX).

The recent geopolitical induced risk-off move has taken a bit of a breather, with both Treasuries and oil prices coming off their recent highs. Some participants are likely cautious ahead of the supply slate this week, with new year’s corporate issuance ramping up alongside the Treasury auctions. One analyst notes that steepeners are likely being entered ahead of the 10- and 30-year auctions in the next few days, indicative of a concession effort ahead of Friday’s NFP report to “seamlessly underwrite the auctions.”</p>",

It follows a chain of punchy rhetoric; the key for traders is what the exact nature of the retaliation will be, and whether that disrupts oil supply in the Middle East; there seems to be a consensus developing that Iran will either opt to attack US (and its allies) military assets in the Middle East via proxies, while attacks to oil infrastructure cannot be ruled out (similar to the attacks on Saudi facilities in September); there are also suggestions that Iran might use its sophisticated cyber army against US interests. The US would view any of these actions as a serious escalation, and President Trump has pledged to aggressively respond. In anticipation of such attacks, CNN reported citing US officials that US forces and air-defence missile batteries were reportedly placed on high alert across the Middle East on Monday night, due to intelligence which was mounting indicating the threat of an imminent attack against US targets. Meanwhile, one remark which has not received much coverage was a senior Iranian official has stating that the nation was prepared to \"come back to full compliance in the Nuclear deal\"; the terms of such a return were not specified, however, Iran has historically demanded sanctions relief as a pre-requisite for such action.</p><p><strong>* US NON-MANUFACTURING ISM (DEC): </strong>The December non-manufacturing ISM report was solid, and analysts said it should dispel the notion that the slowdown in manufacturing surveys heralds weakness in the wider economy. The headline rose 1.1 points in the month, to 55.0, rising above expectations of 54.5. The business activity sub-index rose by a hefty 5.6 points to 57.2 – Wells Fargo said that it serves as the latest indication that activity in the service sector continues to hold up as manufacturing activity has floundered, and notes that other purchasing manager indices - Markit and regional Fed – were consistent with the December gain in the ISM non-manufacturing index, confirming stabilisation within the sector. Ahead of this week’s employment situation report, the employment sub-index fell a touch to 55.2 from 55.5, though WFC still thinks it is a solid read. Meanwhile, the forward-looking new orders sub-index declined by 2.2 points, though still remain comfortably in expansion territory, suggesting growth in the sector, WFC writes.</p><p><strong>* US-CHINA: </strong>The<strong> </strong>Chinese Vice Agricultural Minister said China will not increase annual grain import quotas to accommodate higher US farm purchases, Caixin reported, drawing scepticism on the USD 40bln-50bln agricultural figure the US has been touting; a separate Chinese official, who is not part of the primary trade team, said later that there is still areas of disagreement on the purchases figure and the China Global Times warned there is still things that could go wrong. Participants are anxious for a publication of the agreement prior to its signing to see how detailed it is, with the logic being, the thinner it is on details and specifics, such as a hard agricultural purchases figure, the less substantial the agreement is and the greater pressure on the global growth outlook. However, the Global Times also reported that the Phase One deal is on track and could be signed in the near future, citing sources, although note the lack of a specific date; US President Trump and other US officials have noted January 15th as the signing date, which is scheduled to take place in Washington.</p><p><strong>* US INTERNATIONAL TRADE BALANCE (NOV): </strong>The trade deficit narrowed more than expected, to USD 43.1bln from USD 46.9bln, underpinned by a decline in imports. The implication is that net trade may be a significant contributor to Q4 GDP growth. Import weakness might be explained by temporary factors, Capital Economics says. One spot that received much attention was the fact that the US has now run a trade surplus in petroleum products for three straight months, underlining how much more insulated the economy is to a potential spike in crude prices, CapEco writes.</p><p><strong>* US FACTORY ORDERS (NOV): </strong>Factory orders in November declined by 0.7% M/M (consensus -0.8% M/M), and the prior month’s print was revised down 0.1%. The core, ex-transport measure rose 0.3% M/M.</p><p><strong>* CHINA FX RESERVES: </strong>Data showed FX reserves rising in December to USD 3.108trln (from USD 3.096trln), slightly short of the expected USD 3.11trln. The Street's expectation of a stronger rise was premised on dollar weakness in the period. Pantheon Macroeconomics said it is unlikely that the authorities were selling reserves with any intent to hold the currency back from appreciation. \"They have been very careful not to derail the fragile trade talks with the US, supporting the currency through its weak times, though that doesn’t always show up in FX reserves,\"&nbsp; and the optimism around the deal last month kept the RMB appreciating, giving the authorities some breathing space. \"These data suggest that capital outflows edged up minimally in December, assuming that the trade surplus was little changed, we reckon the Phase One deal should make it over the line as planned this month, while signs of green shoots in the economy also should support the currency, though we still see only stabilisation in the economy at large and think the recovery is on shaky legs, for now,\" Pantheon writes, adding that, at the same time, \"progress on a comprehensive deal seems unlikely, so this could be as good as it gets for the RMB from that perspective.\"</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE HICP (DEC</strong>): Eurozone consumer prices rose in line with expectations, flash December data showed, rising 1.3% Y/Y from 1.0%, while the core measure held at 1.3% Y/Y. ING’s analysts said that, despite the strong increase, it is premature for hawks to get excited, and this is not an environment in which core inflation pressures are increasing: “Depending on oil price developments, which are likely to be volatile as Middle East tensions have spiked recently, it is expected that inflation could trend somewhat higher than the 1% range for the coming months,” ING writes, “but the real story though is in core inflation, which has been at 1.3% for two months in a row now.” ING notes this is higher than expected and might encourage hawks at the ECB to seek some clawback of the monetary stimulus provided in the second half of last year. Nevertheless, ING says that “predictions for a sustained rise in core inflation still seem premature, as wage pressures have been moderating recently thanks to the sluggish and uncertain economic environment. The same holds for selling price expectations which have been trending down, indicating that more modest price growth is in the making in the months ahead.” The bank adds that, while the higher core inflation reading will be on the ECB's radar, continued sluggish growth and subsiding wage pressures make a quick rise to the 1.5-2% range an upside risk scenario, rather than a base case,” and adds that, without material improvement in business confidence and the growth outlook, continued modest price growth seems the most likely scenario for the moment.</p><p><strong>* CANADA TRADE (NOV):</strong> The deficit narrowed to USD 1.1bln, with imports slipping 2.4% M/M, while exports fell 1.4% M/M. RBC notes that, while transitory factors may be in play, recent Canadian data has nevertheless been weak. \"The data comes on the heels of a soft run of economic numbers for October - culminating in a 0.1% decline in GDP in that month - and follows a very soft November labour market report,\" RBC writes, \"the external trade backdrop arguably still has room to improve given some thawing in tensions between the US and China.\" However, RBC argues that softer domestic data reports will keep attention focused on the next batch of Canadian reports, not the least of which will be the next round of employment numbers for December later this week.</p><p><strong>* AUSTRALIA BUSH FIRES: </strong>The Aussie is under pressure, as local banks begin cutting their views of Q1 GDP with the recent wildfires likely to drag on growth. While the outlook is becoming more uncertain, desks are of the view that, at the minimum, the initial impact will be higher inflation and lower growth; while there are expectations that fiscal authorities will loosen the strings (it has pledged AUD 1bln over a two-year horizon), the amounts are not large enough to offset the full effect. The onus then moves on to the RBA, which has stated that if it downgrades the outlook, it would also lower the Cash Rate in response, meaning RBA easing has become more likely.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>MPs returned from recess on Tuesday and began debating the Brexit Withdrawal Bill in a committee stage, which passed as expected; it is also expected to pass through the UK's Upper House without any drama. On Wednesday, new EU Commission President Von der Leyen will be in London to meet UK PM Johnson (EU Brexit negotiator Barnier will join in too), and she will also speak at the LSE. The UK is likely to push for accelerated negotiations in order to avoid any cliff-edge scenarios (the UK must by July decide on whether it will extend the transition period beyond the end-2020 timeline). The sides are also likely to discuss the situation in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>* SPAIN POLITICS: </strong>PSOE Leader Sanchez today was voted in by parliament as PM to lead a minority coalition government comprised of the PSOE socialists and the leftist Podemos party. The vote was close at 167-165, with 18 abstentions, but was expected given that Sanchez last week secured commitment of Catalan parties to abstain, lowering the bar for approval given a simple majority was needed (vs an absolute majority, which PSOE failed at on Sunday). The party has taken aim at big banks threatening higher taxes which resulted in downside for Spanish banks on Tuesday. All is not clear however, as in return for the Catalan parties’ abstentions, Sanchez has agreed to open formal talks on the future of Catalonia, which will be put to a citizen’s vote. Oxford Economics highlights that governing will be very challenging given the extremely narrow margins; thus it will require support from the smaller parties, and therefore OxEco believes it is highly unlikely the coalition will last for its four-year term. Following the result, analysts at Oxford Economics raised its deficit forecast, despite the government’s commitment to deficit targets, as fiscal numbers are coming in weaker than expected.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLED USD 0.57 LOWER AT USD 62.70/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.64 LOWER AT USD 68.27/BBL. </strong>Oil prices came off their recent highs on Tuesday amid a slight reduction in the geopolitical risk premium as participants digest the recent Middle East tensions. Many participants draw attention to the swift reversal of prices in the wake of the Saudi oil facilities attacks in September 2019, although Citigroup’s analysts note Iran’s open call for a proportional counterattack as an indication that the current tensions remain elevated. Some participants may be profit taking too ahead of the energy inventories, where the API reports Tuesday evening ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday. Current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks -3.6mln, distillates +3.9mln, gasoline +2.7mln and Genscape forecast Cushing stocks -0.66mln.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.3% at 3237; NDX unchanged at 8846; DJIA -0.4% at 28,584.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apache (APA) added more than 25% to its market cap upon a new oil discovery, alongside Total (TOT, FP FP) offshore of Suriname. Micron (MU) surged on an upgrade at Cowen on improving DRAM fundamentals; Western Digital (WDC) was also supported by an upgrade by the same analyst, further supporting the wide semiconductor sector (SOX). Microchip Technology (MCHP) was another outperformer after it signalled a bottoming out of the cycle in December and raised its guidance. Tesla (TSLA) firmed on the back of reports it was to begin production of its Model Y SUVs at its new Shanghai plant, with CEO Musk optimistic about its demand. Boeing (BA) was supported by chatter of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) taking an interest, paring back earlier losses from an Underperform initiation at Longbow. Merck (MRK) and Chevron (CVX) traded at the bottom of the Dow, with the former missing endpoints on a Phase 3 Keytruda study and the latter suffering from a downgrade at BofA; note Exxon (XOM) and the wider energy sector (XLE) underperformed amid lower crude prices on a slight pare-back of the geopolitical risk premium. Goldman Sachs (GS) traded higher on reports in the WSJ it would be revamping its corporate accounting structure to increase transparency, also that its executives believe the stock is worth USD 400. Kellogg (K) and Square (SQ) both benefitted from upgrades at Credit Suisse and BofA, respectively. Accenture (ACN) suffered after being downgraded at both MoffettNathanson and BofA. JPMorgan (JPM) took a hit on a downgrade at UBS.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 3 TICKS LOWER AT 129-05. </strong>The T-Note edged slightly<strong> </strong>lower in what was a lacklustre day regarding market activity; the curve was slightly steeper, 30-year yield +3bps and 2-year yield unchanged. The recent geopolitical induced risk-off move has taken a bit of a breather, with both Treasuries and oil prices coming off their recent highs. Some participants are likely cautious ahead of the supply slate this week, with new year’s corporate issuance ramping up alongside the Treasury auctions. One analyst notes that steepeners are likely being entered ahead of the 10- and 30-year auctions in the next few days, indicative of a concession effort ahead of Friday’s NFP report to “seamlessly underwrite the auctions.”</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>US 3-year supply was mediocre, tailing by 0.3bps, with cover a touch beneath recent averages, and the auction did see some slight slippage in wake of the sale. IFR noted that dealers and specs sold the post auction trade with an eye on the duration heavy supply ahead. Desks also note that the corporate supply slate is also heavy this week, providing some competition to Treasuries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts say the 10-year sector has slight set up for the upcoming auction from a relative-value perspective, and the bank feels it looks cheap in both asset swap and on the fly versus 5s and 30s. On an outright basis, the sector appears somewhat rich compared to the last auction cycle, but still appears cheaps on 2s10s given that the curve has steepened since the last auction. SocGen observes that the current 10 trades special in repo, which indicates strong demand for the issue, while the low dealer holdings in the 7-10 year sector might also be a positive. \"We expect fear of escalating geopolitical risks to put a cap on bond yields in the near term, thereby increasing demand among investors for safe assets like Treasuries,\" SocGen says, adding \"we are positive on this auction.\"</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> USD was higher, bid in the morning as US players arrived ahead of trade data and ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI. The Dollar Index (DXY) crossed the key 97.0 figure just prior to the trade data which saw the narrowest deficit since summer of 2017, and extended gains and was boosted following the stronger PMI data. CAD losses accelerated in today’s session, with USDCAD crossing over the psychological 1.30 figure to highs of 1.3029, before paring slightly. The Loonie weakness coincides with a retracement of oil prices which have now pared roughly half of the geopolitical drive move price spike as a chance of extreme escalation seems to have dissipated slightly for now. RUB also trading on similar themes to CAD given Russia’s oil export dominated economy. AUD underperforms as local banks cut Q1 GDP estimates due the recent wildfires, which has increased the probability of a February rate cut from the RBA to around 40% according to OIS. Havens traded somewhat defensive, though XAU continued its rally to highs of 1572, from lows of 1555 overnight. Analysts at Nomura highlight that CTAs appear to have shifted towards rebuilding their gold positions and say that USDJPY gains appear to have hit a ceiling for now. It is also worth highlighting analysts have been keeping an eye on real yields, which have ticked up on Tuesday. EUR traded weaker against the buck amid broad dollar strength which broke a few EURUSD technical levels after falling from highs just shy of 1.12 breaching 1.1150 and the 200dma at 1.1142 briefly, before paring regaining ground and residing around the key technical level heading into Asia trade. GBP lower today, with focus shifting to PM’s meeting with EU Commission president Von Der Leyen on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

UBS says there will be a total of USD 26bln of cash flows (ex SOMA) this week, including USD 24bln of redemptions and USD 2bln of coupons; over the next four weeks, gross supply will total USD 191bln, the bank notes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>SocGen's analysts say the upcoming auction has not got clear set-up from a relative value perspective, noting that it trades fair in asset swap and on the fly versus 2s and 5s. \"The sector looks rich on an outright basis versus the last two auctions, as the current 3y when-issued yield is trading below the stop-yield of previous two auctions,\" SocGen writes, \"however, currently Treasury yields are in the middle of their recent range, and given the risk of rising geopolitical tensions, we expect buyers of Treasuries to materialise.\" The bank notes that dealer holdings are relatively low in the front-end of the curve, which may support demand at the auction. The bank says it is positive on the auction, but suggests that the ISM services PMI, which is released three hours ahead of the auction, may play a role; any upside surprise may see the sector cheapen, adding to the allure of the issue, the bank writes.</p><p><strong>RECENT 3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.632%, six-auction avg. 1.611%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.2bps, six-auction avg. 0.0bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.57x, six-auction avg. 2.47x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 27.1%, six-auction avg. 33.2%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 23.8%, six-auction avg. 18.6%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 49.1%, six-auction avg. 48.3%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/DXY</strong></p><p>Aussie losses have been piling up over the course of the session, and especially once a few key levels/supports gave way, like 0.6900 and 0.6897 (200 DMA) against the Greenback and 1.0367 (18 December low) vs the Kiwi, to leave Aud/Usd probing below the 50 DMA (0.6870) and Aud/Nzd hovering just above 1.0350 after a dip to 1.0340. The catalyst or rather bearish combination of factors emanate from the ongoing bushfires and extend to renewed RBA easing expectations on the premise that the economic fallout will be too pronounced for the CB and Government to address without further monetary and fiscal action. Indeed, data overnight highlighted the damage beyond the obvious physical and environmental costs as job ads tumbled. Elsewhere, Nzd/Usd also declined, albeit a bit less aggressively through 0.6650 towards 0.6625 in sympathy, and continued to largely ignore GDT auction results, while the Loonie lost power as crude prices recoiled and Usd/Cad breached its 2019 close (1.2987) on the way through 1.3000 towards 1.3030. Note also, following pretty similar Canadian and US trade data in terms of actual deficits vs consensus the contrast between non-manufacturing ISM and Ivey PMIs could not have been more glaring as the former beat expectations handsomely vs significantly weaker SA and NSA prints. Hence, the US Dollar proffered not just on the back of others, but in its own right, with the index trying to maintain recovery gains/momentum on the 97.000 handle again.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>The Euro has fallen victim to the broad Buck revival and failure to rally beyond 1.1200 at the latest attempt, with the single currency shrugging off mixed Eurozone inflation and retail sales data along with confirmation that Spain’s Sanchez secured (just) enough votes to form a government along the way. Eur/Usd subsequently reversed through 1.1150 and the 200 DMA (1.1141), but not far enough to trigger decent option expiry interest at 1.1125 (1.25 bn) at the NY cut. Similarly, the Franc could not sustain 97.000+ territory even though Swiss y/y CPI rose 0.2% from -0.1% previously and vs an anticipated flat reading, while Cable collapsed between 1.3200+/sub-1.3100 parameters on little obvious aside from flow/orders and stop activity, with Eur/Gbp trading inversely. Meanwhile, the Yen derived support from reported supply at 108.50 until overall Dollar strength and improving risk sentiment proved too compelling and Usd/Jpy broke more convincingly through recent peaks to around 108.63.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Choppy trade in Scandinavia as the Swedish Krona extended declines through 10.5500 at one stage, but then recouped the bulk of its losses in contrast to its Norwegian equivalent that also waned with oil.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>More power outages from SA’s Eskom and the aforementioned general Greenback rebound that undermined most regional currencies, bar the Cnh (and Cny by proxy), scuppered the Zar, as the Rand swung around sharply from 14.1400 or so to circa 14.3400 before paring back.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>The non-manufacturing ISM is seen rising to 54.5 in December (analyst forecast range is between 52.9 and 55.5), from 53.9 in November.</li><li><strong>OTHER SURVEYS BODE WELL: </strong>Analysts note that the Markit gauge of services PMI rose by was revised up on Monday, taking it to 52.8 from the flash 52.2 (NOTE: it has a different composition than the ISM equivalent). The Markit services PMI showed output and new order expansions quicken, but remain at only modest levels. New orders came in at 52.7 vs flash 52.5 and November final 51.6, auguring well for the January data. &nbsp;Ahead of this week's payrolls report, the employment sub-index rose at the fastest rate since July, Markit said, while inflationary pressures were picking up. The report said the survey results are indicative of GDP rising at a relatively modest annual rate of 1.8% in December. NOTE: desks note that there has been a divergence in the Markit and ISM PMIs, of late. Elsewhere, regional Fed surveys like the Dallas Fed, NY, Richmond, and KC surveys all improved in the month.</li><li><strong>NON-MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>Focussing on today's non-manufacturing ISM, Nomura's analysts forecast an above-consensus 55.2, arguing that its forecast is consistent with growth roughly at potential, as the non-manufacturing sector continues to weather the industrial slowdown relatively well. \"The announced phase one trade deal and news coverage of a possible ramp-up in Chinese purchases of US agricultural products poses some upside risk to the December ISM non-manufacturing index, given the coverage of the agricultural sector,\" the bank writes.</li><li><strong>TARIFF IMPACT PRESENTS DOWNSIDE RISKS: </strong>Some desks note that, in recent months, the non-manufacturing ISM has been much weaker than implied by its typical relationship with the rate of growth of core retail sales, which Pantheon Macroeconomics assumes is a result of intensifying trade wars in the Spring/Summer. Indeed, that dynamic with core rretail sales has seen Pantheon forecast a fall to 53.0; it argues that any positive follow-through from phase one will be seen in the months ahead, when the dust settles.</li><li><strong>WATCH THE EMPLOYMENT SUB INDEX: </strong>Ahead of this week's employment situation report, watch the employment sib-index. In November, it rose to 55.5, the highest since July, and the third month of improvement. Another rise in December may give credence to the argument that labour demand might not have been as weak as some measures suggested in Q3/Q4 2019, when they signalled cooling labour market momentum.</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, having met stiff resistance at 108.00 on several occasions of late the Yen is now deriving support from offers said to be capping the headline pair at 108.50, but the Pound has waned markedly after a stop driven rally in Cable on a break of 1.3180 (just above Monday’s peak) to 1.3200+ that pushed Eur/Gbp back under 0.8500 with more gusto and just under 0.8470 before the cross retraced some lost ground.</p><p>SEK - Some respite for the Swedish Crown via a less contractionary services PMI, but Eur/Sek is still elevated above the 10.5000 level in contrast to Eur/Nok holding shy of 9.8500.</p><p>EM - Although the Dollar has made advances elsewhere, Yuan strength off a marginally firmer PBoC midpoint fix has bucked the general trend, as Usd/Cnh eases back towards mid-December lows not far from 6.9200 and a series of key chart supports closer to 6.9000 amidst reports from the Chinese side alluding to the signing of Phase 1 in the not too distant future.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>UK debt remains weak or soft relatively speaking, but well-off worst levels on the back of a solid 2029 DMO Gilt offering that clearly came with a more appealing yield concession for investors to counter some concerns about more issuance to absorb the end of Q1.

Newsflow from the Middle-East continues to emerge with the latest pertinent reports noting that Iran is, according to a Fars report, considering 13-scenarios as retaliation against the US. Additionally, a Senior Iranian Official has stated that Iran is prepared to come back to full compliance with the Nuclear Deal. Note, Iran has following the assassination of Soleimani made clear that they are to conduct nuclear related operations on their own accord, disregarding the Nuclear Deal; as such, these remarks potentially indicate a pivot in Iran’s stance against the US and Western powers. However, its worth highlighting that the conditions around their potential return to the deal are not known and previously Iran has indicated sanction relief is a pre-requisite for this type of action. Looking ahead, today sees the funeral of Soleimani and as such participants will now be more actively anticipating/awaiting a response from Iran as the initial mourning period comes to an end.

Additionally, last week PSOE leader Sanchez secure the commitment of Catalan parties to abstain on today's vote, lowering the bar for passage, though raises some risk for the future, since Sanchez in return agreed to open a formal talks on the future of Catalonia if he is confirmed as PM, which will be put to a citizens' vote.</li><li>Given the left-wing nature of the potential coalition government, desks have focussed on the fiscal implications.

Hence, the Aussie has weakened appreciably across the board, with Aud/Usd slipping through 0.6900 and the 200 DMA (0.6897), while Aud/Nzd has also breached a key chart level at 1.0367 (18 December 2019 low) as the Kiwi contains contagious losses against its US counterpart within 0.6642-80 parameters.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Aside from gleaning traction from the underperformance in Antipodean peers, the Greenback is consolidating off recent lows vs major rivals on a combination of technical and other factors awaiting further developments on the geopolitical front (namely Iran’s response to the US airstrike targeting and killing a top IRGC leader). The <strong>DXY </strong>has pared declines towards 96.500 and appears more settled in a 96.620-835 range ahead of the upcoming services ISM that could be pivotal for near term Fed policy given the disappointing manufacturing survey and expectations for a firmer headline than previous.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/CAD/JPY/GBP</strong></p><p>As noted above, all weaker against the Buck with the Franc back below 0.9700 and not really inflated by Swiss CPI returning to positive territory in y/y terms, Euro fading ahead of 1.1200 and Loonie losing momentum alongside oil prices in advance of 1.2950 in the run up to Canadian trade data due alongside the US balance for direct comparison. Meanwhile, having met stiff resistance at 108.00 on several occasions of late the Yen is now deriving support from offers said to be capping the headline pair at 108.50, but the Pound has waned markedly after a stop driven rally in Cable on a break of 1.3180 (just above Monday’s peak) to 1.3200+ that pushed Eur/Gbp back under 0.8500 with more gusto and just under 0.8470 before the cross retraced some lost ground.</p><p><strong>SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some respite for the Swedish Crown via a less contractionary services PMI, but Eur/Sek is still elevated above the 10.5000 level in contrast to Eur/Nok holding shy of 9.8500.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Although the Dollar has made advances elsewhere, Yuan strength off a marginally firmer PBoC midpoint fix has bucked the general trend, as Usd/Cnh eases back towards mid-December lows not far from 6.9200 and a series of key chart supports closer to 6.9000 amidst reports from the Chinese side alluding to the signing of Phase 1 in the not too distant future.</p>",

(BBC)</p><p><strong>FX DXY</strong> held onto a bulk of the prior day’s losses but remained within a tight 96.68-62 parameter overnight. <strong>EUR/USD</strong> was contained just under the 1.1200 mark but managed to stay north of its 50 WMA at 1.1174. Meanwhile, <strong>GBP/USD</strong> drifted higher throughout the session and probed 1.3175 with the pair unreactive to reports that emergency preparations for a no-deal Brexit have been stood down.<strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> clenched onto recent gains as the overall risk tone kept the pairs afloat, and as the former attempted another test of 108.50 to the upside. Antipodeans traded choppy, albeit within narrow ranges. <strong>AUD/USD</strong> tested 0.6925 to the downside on multiple occasions but lingered above the figure, whilst its <strong>Kiwi</strong> counterpart gleaned some support from the <strong>AUD/NZD cross</strong> losing ground below the psychological 1.0400 level. Finally, <strong>CNY</strong> saw strength ahead of sources reports that the US-China Phase One deal remains on track - which prompted USD/CNY to test 6.9500 to the downside before briefly dipping below the psychological figure. <i>Note: <strong>DXY</strong> strengthened to fresh session highs as European participants entered the market and as such, weakness was experienced in G10 pairs in which <strong>EUR/USD</strong> fell to around 1.1180, <strong>GBP/USD</strong> tested 1.3150 to the downside and <strong>AUD/USD</strong> eyed 0.6900 to the downside.</i></p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures continued to bleed in overnight trade. Brent front-month contracts dipped below the USD 68/bbl and WTI briefly traded below USD 62.50/bbl vs. recent highs of around USD 70.70/bbl and USD 64.70/bbl respectively. Downside in the complex also coincided with source reports via Washington Post which noted that the Trump administration has begun drafting sanctions against Iraq, but that the plan was to wait and see if Iraq follows through with their threat first rather than immediate penalties. Participants will be on the lookout for any potential Iranian retaliations after IRGC Commander Soleimani’s burial later today, as cautioned by several analysts. Spot <strong>gold</strong> continued to unwind some of its recent gains, although a sharp move lower of just under USD 10/bbl was seen with little by way of fresh fundamental catalysts to explain the move. Traders cite the downside to stops tripped at prior support around USD 1560/oz. Finally, <strong>copper</strong> prices were bolstered by the overall risk-sentiment but stopped short of resistance at USD 2.79/lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>OPEC+ said it will respond to any oil emergency from the crisis in Iran, however spare capacity is tight, according to Platts Oil.

The Treasury complex saw some profit-taking after gains seen at the start of the year, and amid a lack of fresh developments on the US/Iran front; the shape of the curve was little changed, while nominal yields inched up slightly. Analysts chewed the fat over the Iran situation, and there seems to be a consensus that from the oil market's perspective, the status quo is manageable (although much of that will depend on the next moves from stakeholders). Decent services PMI data out of major markets on Monday also helped, and the upward revision to the US Markit services PMI raises hopes of a decent ISM services print on Tuesday. Additionally, the corporate supply slate is heavy, with expectations of around USD 30bln of corporate dollar supply on tap for this week, while some have suggested that it might be as high as USD 40bln.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.9%) is propped up by its largest-weighed financials as yields recouped from recent downside. Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) is retracing some of the prior session’s hefty losses whilst welcoming recent favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.4%) conform to the overall risk appetite - and with the former supported by gains in large-cap financial stocks.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY hold onto a bulk of the prior day’s losses but remained within a tight 96.67-62 parameter. EUR/USD trades choppy just under the 1.1200 mark but manages to stay north of its 50 WMA at 1.1174. Meanwhile, GBP/USD drifts higher throughout the session and probed 1.3175 with the pair unreactive to reports that emergency preparations for a no-deal Brexit have been stood down as UK PM Johnson’s deal is almost certain to make its passage through parliament. That said, officials remain concerned regarding a cliff-edge Brexit, according to Sky News’ Cohen. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses clench onto recent gains as the overall risk tone kept the pairs afloat, with the former re-eyeing 108.50 to the upside. Finally, Antipodeans trade choppy, albeit within narrow ranges. AUD/USD tested 0.6925 to the downside on multiple occasions but lingers above the figure.</p>",
