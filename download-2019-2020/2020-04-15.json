It is easy to attribute the downside to dismal economic data, however, futures were trading red before the 0830 ET retail sales and Empire Fed (both grim, and worse than expected); the dollar was firmer on the session, and although pared back after the data, retained its bid. A stronger dollar has been associated with risk-off type trading recently. The Treasury curve meanwhile bull-flattened. Oil continues to slide; there were some dire warnings from the IEA on demand today as well as chunky inventory builds in the US. Early doors, bank earnings were in focus pre-market, particularly, the building of loan loss provisions. Goldman Sachs (GS) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, while Provision for credit losses were at USD 937mln (exp. 550mln, prev. 224mln). Its FICC revenue was up 33% Y/Y to 2.97bln which saw its bond trading results the strongest in five years. Although overall, results were hit by debt and equity holdings in its asset management business, but its trading topped expectations. Bank of America (BAC) also missed on EPS, revenue also fell slightly short. Loan loss provisions increased to USD 4.8bln, above estimates. BAC saw a similar story to JPM where EPS took a hit on the increased credit provisions but NII and NIM were strong at 12.13bln and 2.91%, both above expectations. In a call however, its CFO noted NII could approach 11bln in Q2 and expects the largest COVID impact on NII in Q2, and its CEO highlighted it has had an impact on every part of its business. Citi (C) beat on both EPS and revenue, while credit provisions rose to 7.03bln from 2.22bln last quarter. Elsewhere, United Health (UNH) are firmer after a decent report with top and bottom-line beats while it maintained its FY EPS view, noting it does not request or plan to request any government aid and airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV, JBLU, ALK) were firmer after the companies reached an agreement with the Treasury for payroll aid through the Payroll Support Program. SPX -2.2% at 2783, NDX -1.15% at 8592, DJIA -1.86% at 23,504.</p><p>The Treasury complex bull-flattened markedly on Wednesday as risk appetite soured. The bid gained traction overnight as European trade commenced. In essence, equity futures were reversing yesterday’s strength and a dump in crude futures (a gloomy IEA report and chunky inventory builds) kept the macro narrative defensive. Then as the heavy US data slate got underway, which was dire across all accounts with “worst-ever/since” headlines bombarding screens, Treasury strength continued, although how much of the move was reactionary to the data remains a point for debate as many are looking past near-term prints. One desk noted that real money had been booking profits and selling into the Fed’s Treasury purchases, which were accompanied by hefty offer-to-cover ratios, stalling the move lower in yields in the afternoon; at the same time, the desk noted that specs and CTAs were taking the other side of the trade. USD issuance was afoot on Wednesday, likely keeping a cap on Treasury strength, where participants digested a USD 7bln three-parter from Saudi Arabia (5s, 10s, 40s), as well as lumpy, post-earnings USD 10bln launched from JPMorgan (6s, 11s, 21s, 31s). By settlement, curve spreads had flattened, with 2s -2bps at 0.20%, 10s -11bps at 0.64%, and 30s -14bps at 1.27%. Meanwhile, in STIRs, nearby Eurodollar futures rallied, with desks noting block trades in the May contract, coming amid the launch of the Fed’s CPFF, which will be supportive of the depression of USD LIBOR from its elevated levels; the move signals the market’s confidence that LIBOR will fall further in the next month or so. US T-note futures (M0) settled 30 ticks higher at 139-05.</p>",

It is easy to attribute the downside to dismal economic data, however, futures were trading red before the 0830 ET retail sales and Empire Fed (both grim, and worse than expected); the dollar was firmer on the session, and although pared back after the data, retained its bid. A stronger dollar has been associated with risk-off type trading recently. The Treasury curve meanwhile bull-flattened. Oil continues to slide; there were some dire warnings from the IEA on demand today as well as chunky inventory builds in the US. Early doors, bank earnings were in focus pre-market, particularly, the building of loan loss provisions. Looking ahead, the focus will be on Thursday’s initial jobless claims data, which analysts expect to print 5.105mln.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Wednesday (via state offcial health departments) against Tuesday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>cases rise +4.6% to 605,390 (prev. +4.4% at 579,005), death toll rises 10.5% to 24,582 (prev. +1.4% at 22,252).</li><li><strong>New York</strong> COVID-19 cases +5.7% to 213,779 (prev. +3.7% at 202,208); death toll rises +6.9% to 11,586 (prev. +7.7% at 10,834)</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>cases rise by 1.6% to 165,155 (prev. +1.9% at 162,488), death toll rises by 2.7% to 21,645 (prev. +2.9% at 21,067).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>cases rose to 177,633 (prev. 172,541), death toll rises to 18,579 (prev. 18,056).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>cases rose by 2486 to 127584, death toll rose by 285 to 3254.</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>cases rise 5.48% to 106,206 (prev. +5.6% to 103,573); death toll +12.1% at 17,167 (Prev. +5.1% to 15,729).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>COVID-19 cases rise to 98,476 (prev. 93,873), death toll rises to 12,868 (prev. 12,107); deaths rise by 761 (+6.29%) vs. yesterday's increase of 778 (+6.87%).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>cases rise to 26,336 (prev. 25,834), death toll rises to 973 (prev. 900).</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>cases rise to 27,540 (prev. 27,063), death toll rises to 954 (prev. 903).</li></ul><h2><strong>GLOBAL</strong></h2><p><strong>WHO: </strong>President Trump stated that he instructed the administration to halt funding to the WHO as a review is being conducted. House Democrats said Trump has no authority to block WHO funds and there were also comments from UN Secretary General Guterres that now is not the time to reduce resources for operations amid the pandemic.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>China could be secretly conducting nuclear tests with very low explosive power, raising concern that it might be in breach of international law, according to a new arms-control report to be soon made public by the State Department, cited by WSJ. Furthermore, US Defense Secretary Esper said China could have have been more transparent earlier, saying that even today China is holding information on COVID-19.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The Small Business loan programme is expected to run out of money later on Wednesday, exhausting the initial allocation of USD 350bln, according to WSJ citing a person familiar with the matter. Both Democrats and Republicans have been debating over fresh funds for the programme but have not yet been able to come to an agreement. Earlier, there were comments from US House Majority Leader Hoyer, who said he can’t guarantee that an agreement will be reached than can also pass by Friday, but is hopeful an agreement will be reached with Friday as an optimal scenario.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump said plans to reopen the country are nearing completion and he will speak to all Governors shortly as well as authorise them to open states in the appropriate time and manner, which could happen for some before May 1st.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>BOC:</strong> The bank of Canada left rates unchanged at its lower bound of 0.25% as expected. The bank decided not to release its economic projections given the current situation it would not be able to provide an accurate forecast. Although it stated that bank analysis of alternative scenarios suggests the level of real activity was down 1-3% in Q1 and will be 15-30% lower in Q2 than in Q4 2019. CPI is expected to be close to 0% in Q2 2020, primarily due to the transitory effects of lower gasoline prices. The bank announced two new programmes: the Provincial Bond Purchase Program of up to CAD 50bln (2% of GDP) and the Corporate Bond Purchase Programme of CAD 10bln (0.4% of GDP); both are to be put in place in the coming weeks. Capital Economics highlighted that the size of these programmes are relatively small, and could signal any future policy moves may involve expanding these programmes. The BoC also enhanced its term repo facility to permit funding for up to 24-months, and temporarily increased the amount of Treasury Bills it acquires at auctions to up to 40% (from 20%); CapEco suggests this is aimed at improving the market function rather than increasing the budget deficit. In the press conference, outgoing Governor Poloz reiterated actions taken currently are to improve the functioning of markets, and reiterated that the BOC would stand ready to adjust the scale or duration of programs if necessary. The press conference saw little new information, although Deputy Governor Wilkins noted that credit easing is part of its tools, she did not want to speculate on any future possible use of the aforementioned tools. Governor Poloz noted rates would be very low throughout the recovery phase, and when asked about whether he would stay on as Governor (this was his last rate decision) he stated the bank is sticking with its plan to choose a successor, which is 90% done.</p><p><strong>PBOC </strong>cut the one-year rate on its Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) by 20bps to 2.95%, an all-time low. Capital Economics says the move makes it likely that the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) will decline on Monday, providing lower borrowing costs; the LPR is set by bank quotations which are then determined by a spread over the MLF. The consultancy believes another 100bps of rate reductions across policy instruments will take place this year.</p><p><strong>ECB:</strong> ECB’s Makhlouf is sceptical about a “V” shaped recovery and expects it to be more gradual. Makhlouf added the ECB is ready to support economies and citizens even further if it requires. Elsewhere, the ECB announced it supported the action taken by macroprudential authorities to address the financial sector by releasing or reducing capital buffers.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> Eurogroup head Centeno did not rule out using ‘coronabonds’ as part of a response to the COVID-19; he expects the EC to give guidance on the proposed recovery fund on April 23rd, adding that part of the fund needs to be available for Spring/Summer. Meanwhile, France is to issue EUR 245bln of medium and long-term bonds net of buybacks this year, up from the March estimate of EUR 210bln; to raise outstanding stocks of T-Bills by an additional EUR 34.6bln, according to the AFT. France had been in favour of coronabonds, although it is now raising its issuance after the Eurogroup failed to agree on such (as was expected).</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN:</strong> European Commission President von der Leyen said EU countries should use a “gradual tailor-made approach” to lifting lockdown restrictions, adding that recommendations focus on three main preconditions: 1) a significant decrease in the spread of the coronavirus; 2) sufficient health system capacity; 3) adequate surveillance and monitoring capacity. Meanwhile, according to Handelsblatt, the German government is set to extend COVID-19 restrictions until May 3rd. German Chancellor Merkel says any further relaxation of lockdown will be dependent on how the infection rate develops, little room to manoeuvre</p><p><strong>BREXIT:</strong> Brexit negotiators have conducted a video call on Wednesday to finalise next week’s large-scale trade negotiations, as well as discuss a potential extension to the transition period amid COVID-19, the Telegraph reported. However, FT said recently that the UK is holding out on providing EU with detailed fishing rights proposals which could derail approaching talks. The Express noted that the UK is pressing on with sealing a Brexit deal by the end of the year despite reservations from Brussels; EU member states have agreed that areas, where both sides agree, should not be allowed to progress too far ahead while talks stall on the more contentious areas – such as fisheries and level playing field. Surprisingly, EU27 diplomats have been told there are several areas of convergence where deals can be struck with relative ease, but ‘very, very big gaps’ still need to be bridged where both sides disagree.</p><p><strong>UK:</strong> The government, on Thursday, is likely to announce that lockdown will remain until at least May 7th. UK Health Minister later said it is clear that it is too early to make changes to lockdown measures; high deaths will continue for at least a short while. Note a COBRA meeting will take place on Thursday to determine the official government guidance.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US RETAIL SALES: </strong>Although monthly March retail sales data showed a decline deeper than analysts were expecting, some analysts took comfort in some of the internals; the control Group (which feeds into GDP) fell by 1.7%, not as bad as the -2.0% the Street was expecting. BMO said that data collection was always going to be a concern, and notes the report stated “many businesses are operating in a limited capacity or have ceased operations completely. As a result, their ability to provide accurate, timely information to Census may be limited.” Additionally, the report said “data collection is now occurring primarily via email requests and online reporting”; BMO argues that this suggests that firms that are shut down are not reporting, therefore potentially skewing the core numbers higher.</p><p><strong>EMPIRE STATE MANUFACTURING: </strong>Last month’s record dropped was usurped by the April data, which saw a record fall of 56.7 points to -78.20, way below the Street’s -35.0 expectation. To highlight the magnitude, analysts note that the low in 2008 was -34.3, making it clear that manufacturing is being hit as hard as the services sector. The sub-indices all declined, with the exception of delivery times, which rose because supply chains have shut down, Pantheon said. “The average level of the key Empire State components points to the national ISM manufacturing index falling to about 35; the December 2008 low was 34.5,” Pantheon writes, “whether that level is undershot in April or May doesn’t matter; the point is that manufacturing is in meltdown.”</p><p><strong>INDUSTRIAL/MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION:</strong> Industrial production drops by the most since 1946, consistent with manufacturing contracting by 20% annualised, Capital Economics says. US industrial production dropped by a hefty 5.4% M/M in March - deeper than the 4.0% decline analysts had expected, and the largest monthly fall since 1946, once again highlighting that the manufacturing side of the economy is being hammered as much as the services side. Manufacturing production itself fell by 6.3% M/M, also the largest monthly drop since WW2, mainly due to the fall in motor vehicle production, but every industry group saw output fall - even food and beverages, despite the panic buying seen in the month. “With many factories only being shut down in the last couple of weeks of last month, however, the March data will capture only part of the associated hit to activity,” Capital Economics says, “indeed, the collapse in the Empire State manufacturing index to a record low of -78.2 in April, from -21.5, leaves it consistent with manufacturing output falling at a 20% annualised pace.”</p><p><strong>BUSINESS INVENTORIES:</strong> Business inventories fell 0.4% in March, as expected, a slightly larger decline than the prior revised -0.3%. Oxford Economics highlights that businesses were not stocking inventories ahead of the coronavirus outbreak, noting impact on both demand and supply strains will leave inventories under pressure. It adds that “economic activity should start to rebound in the latter half of 2020, but risks are heavily tilted to the downside.”</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.24 LOWER AT USD 19.87/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 1.91 LOWER AT USD 27.69/BBL</strong></p><p>Crude futures continued their post-OPEC + decline on Wednesday as ballooning inventories, dismal IEA forecasts, and US data, and little risk appetite all sunk their teeth. Prices continued lower in APAC and European trade, after the bearish private US inventories report on Tuesday, and particularly after the IEA posted its gloomy monthly report today (see below). At the same time, making the losses more acute was the paring of risk appetite in equities. The selling pressure found no reprieve in the US session either as the EIA weekly report showed crude stocks (bbls) building a record 19.2mln, gasoline +5mln, distillates +6mln; production fell by 100k BPD to 12.3mln BPD, although with storage reaching capacity, the cut will make little difference to the global supply glut. Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco has offered Asian and European refineries a payment deferral for crude cargoes by up to 90 days, sources reported; at least three refiners rejected the terms due to higher financing costs. However, Saudi later claimed such reports were false. Note, in the tail end of the session (post-settlement) reports were suggesting the US is considering a plan which would pay oil producers not to produce.</p><p><strong>IEA MONTHLY OIL MARKET REPORT</strong> sees Global oil demand set to fall by a record 9.3mln BPD in 2020, potentially down by 29mln BPD in April. The report said SPR purchases could reach 200mln BPD in the next three months - still awaiting details on stock purchases. No feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near-term demand losses - “however, the past week’s achievements are a solid start.” Predicts output falls by other countries, such as the US and Canada, could be around 3.5mln amid lower prices.</p><p><strong>OPEC: </strong>Mexico will curtail production by 100k BPD in the months of May-June only, according to the Mexican Energy Minister; this is in-fitting with the OPEC+ pact announced over the weekend. OPEC initially wanted the country to cut output by 400k BPD, talks at the time hit a snag amid a rift between Saudi and Mexico. US stepped in as stated it will take some of the curtailment burden off Mexico (US committed to shoulder 250k BPD cuts on Mexico’s behalf). Meanwhile, in Russia, oil companies in the country are examining which wells they will curtail production at, looking mainly at mature fields where production was falling anyway, amid Moscow’s commitment for its largest-ever output cut, sources reported. Sources close to industry and government said that Moscow was preparing to cut its production by around 2mln BPD anyway amid the poor demand outlook.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 30 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-05.</strong></p><p>The Treasury complex bull-flattened markedly on Wednesday as risk appetite soured. The bid gained traction overnight as European trade commenced. In essence, equity futures were reversing yesterday’s strength and a dump in crude futures (a gloomy IEA report and chunky inventory builds) kept the macro narrative defensive. Then as the heavy US data slate got underway, which was dire across all accounts with “worst-ever/since” headlines bombarding screens, Treasury strength continued, although how much of the move was reactionary to the data remains a point for debate as many are looking past near-term prints. One desk noted that real money had been booking profits and selling into the Fed’s Treasury purchases, which were accompanied by hefty offer-to-cover ratios, stalling the move lower in yields in the afternoon; at the same time, the desk noted that specs and CTAs were taking the other side of the trade. USD issuance was afoot on Wednesday, likely keeping a cap on Treasury strength, where participants digested a USD 7bln three-parter from Saudi Arabia (5s, 10s, 40s), as well as lumpy, post-earnings USD 10bln launched from JPMorgan (6s, 11s, 21s, 31s). By settlement, curve spreads had flattened, with 2s -2bps at 0.20%, 10s -11bps at 0.64%, and 30s -14bps at 1.27%. Meanwhile, in STIRs, nearby Eurodollar futures rallied, with desks noting block trades in the May contract, coming amid the launch of the Fed’s CPFF, which will be supportive of the depression of USD LIBOR from its elevated levels; the move signals the market’s confidence that LIBOR will fall further in the next month or so.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -2.2% at 2783, NDX -1.15% at 8592, DJIA -1.86% at 23,504.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -4.7%, Materials -4.5%, Financials -4.37%, Real Estate -3.8%, Utilities -3.36%, Industrials -2.8%, Communication svs -2.8%, Technology -2.2%, Consumer Discretionary -1.57%, Consumer Staples -1.56%, Health Care -0.5%</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Goldman Sachs (GS) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, while Provision for credit losses were at USD 937mln (exp. 550mln, prev. 224mln). Its FICC revenue was up 33% Y/Y to 2.97bln which saw its bond trading results the strongest in five years. Although overall, results were hit by debt and equity holdings in its asset management business, but its trading topped expectations. Bank of America (BAC) also missed on EPS, revenue also fell slightly short. Loan loss provisions increased to USD 4.8bln, above estimates. BAC saw a similar story to JPM where EPS took a hit on the increased credit provisions but NII and NIM were strong at 12.13bln and 2.91%, both above expectations. In a call however, its CFO noted NII could approach 11bln in Q2 and expects the largest COVID impact on NII in Q2, and its CEO highlighted it has had an impact on every part of its business. Citi (C) beat on both EPS and revenue, while credit provisions rose to 7.03bln from 2.22bln last quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenue rose 39% to USD 4.8bln, reflecting strength in rates, currencies and commodities. Equity Markets revenue that rose 39% to USD 1.2bln with strong performance in derivatives; includes higher client activity as a result of the higher volatility. Regional bank PNC Financial (PNC) beat on EPS and revenue, NII fell Q/Q, while credit loss provisions rose 693mln to 914mln. US Bancorp (USB) missed on EPS but beat on revenue while NII declined, Provision for credit losses stood at 993mln (+600mln); note some desks highlight the regionals may have to increase its provisions in the upcoming quarters. Elsewhere, United Health (UNH) are firmer after a decent report with top and bottom-line beats while it maintained its FY EPS view, noting it does not request or plan to request any government aid.</p><p><strong>STOCK NEWS: </strong>Airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV, JBLU, ALK) firmer after the companies reached an agreement with the Treasury for payroll aid through the Payroll Support Program.

DXY the 99 figure and saw highs around 99.80, although since a dismal slate of US data, it has pared and sits around the 99.50 handle at pixel time; yields were lower across the curve (bull-flattening) which likely limited some of the upside.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> “USDJPY hasn’t been trading well with risk sentiment recently,” Citi writes, while equities are lower today but USDJPY firmer as dollar strength dominates the Yen which saw USDJPY trade within 106.94-107.84. Citi highlight the 106.90 level as area as support which held true today, and the desk writes “if this level continues to hold, we could see the pair retest 108.30 where the 200dma converges with the horizontal resistance. However, a close below there would open the way for downside acceleration towards 104.50”.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Weighed by narrowing Bund/BTP spreads after Italy announced it would hold larger bond auctions and plans for more costly syndicated debt placements for shorter maturities to finance ramped-up spending to respond to the virus fallout. Additionally, desks continue to cite disappointment with the Eurogroup’s response package announced last week (specifically, the absence of Eurozone joint debt issuance). EURUSD however picked up off lows slightly and is now back above 109 just shy of the 50hma at 1.0942.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> Has given back some of Tuesday’s gains, which saw it rise to a fresh 7-year high. Credit Suisse says “the resilience of gold points to markets view that as central bank balance sheets across the world both expand in size and deteriorate in quality, gold should benefit as the ultimate of expression of resistance to likely global monetisation of increasingly weak fiscal outlooks.”</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie was hit in the morning as crude prices tumbled, and declines accelerated after an update form the IEA, which sees global oil demand falling by a record 9.3mln BPD, while adding that no feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near term demand losses. The BoC resulted in little by way of price action, despite announcing two new programmes (PBPP and CBPP), although the size of these are relatively small.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> After seven consecutive days of gains, the recovery has been halted by a weak consumer sentiment report and a soft risk environment. The Aussie fell beneath its 50dma around 0.6364. Participants will be eyeing jobs data later on tonight; RBC suggests that we are likely to see some impact despite the survey period being prior before the increased social distancing measures as businesses “began to stand down or shed labour amid a reduction in turnover and expectations of tougher restrictions.”</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling recent rally came to a pause as risk sentiment soured seeing Cable move from highs of 1.2630 to lows of 1.2439. GBPUSD failed to breach it’s 200 dma at 1.2657 (a level to keep an eye on) while some highlight strong demand beneath 1.25. The number of new deaths continues to slow slightly in the UK although officials are waiting for further clarification before suggesting a peak has been reached. The Health Minister announced it is too early to make changes to lockdown measures, while high deaths will continue for a while. On Brexit, the UK is sticking to its roots and is not expected to request an extension by the end of June deadline, with negotiations set to take place on April 20th, May 11th, and June 1st via a video call.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX in general was weaker against the buck today amid soured risk appetite.

It is easy to attribute the downside to dismal economic data, however, futures were trading red before the 0830 ET retail sales and Empire Fed (both grim, and worse than expected); the dollar was firmer on the session, and although pared back after the data, retained its bid. A stronger dollar has been associated with risk-off type trading recently. The Treasury curve meanwhile bull-flattened. Oil continues to slide; there were some dire warnings from the IEA on demand today as well as chunky inventory builds in the US. Early doors, bank earnings were in focus pre-market, particularly, the building of loan loss provisions. Looking ahead, the focus will be on Thursday’s initial jobless claims data, which analysts expect to print 5.105mln.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Wednesday (via state offcial health departments) against Tuesday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>cases rise +4.6% to 605,390 (prev. +4.4% at 579,005), death toll rises 10.5% to 24,582 (prev. +1.4% at 22,252).</li><li><strong>New York</strong> COVID-19 cases +5.7% to 213,779 (prev. +3.7% at 202,208); death toll rises +6.9% to 11,586 (prev. +7.7% at 10,834)</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>cases rise by 1.6% to 165,155 (prev. +1.9% at 162,488), death toll rises by 2.7% to 21,645 (prev. +2.9% at 21,067).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>cases rose to 177,633 (prev. 172,541), death toll rises to 18,579 (prev. 18,056).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>cases rose by 2486 to 127584, death toll rose by 285 to 3254.</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>cases rise 5.48% to 106,206 (prev. +5.6% to 103,573); death toll +12.1% at 17,167 (Prev. +5.1% to 15,729).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>COVID-19 cases rise to 98,476 (prev. 93,873), death toll rises to 12,868 (prev. 12,107); deaths rise by 761 (+6.29%) vs. yesterday's increase of 778 (+6.87%).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>cases rise to 26,336 (prev. 25,834), death toll rises to 973 (prev. 900).</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>cases rise to 27,540 (prev. 27,063), death toll rises to 954 (prev. 903).</li></ul><h2><strong>GLOBAL</strong></h2><p><strong>WHO: </strong>President Trump stated that he instructed the administration to halt funding to the WHO as a review is being conducted. House Democrats said Trump has no authority to block WHO funds and there were also comments from UN Secretary General Guterres that now is not the time to reduce resources for operations amid the pandemic.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>China could be secretly conducting nuclear tests with very low explosive power, raising concern that it might be in breach of international law, according to a new arms-control report to be soon made public by the State Department, cited by WSJ. Furthermore, US Defense Secretary Esper said China could have have been more transparent earlier, saying that even today China is holding information on COVID-19.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The Small Business loan programme is expected to run out of money later on Wednesday, exhausting the initial allocation of USD 350bln, according to WSJ citing a person familiar with the matter. Both Democrats and Republicans have been debating over fresh funds for the programme but have not yet been able to come to an agreement. Earlier, there were comments from US House Majority Leader Hoyer, who said he can’t guarantee that an agreement will be reached than can also pass by Friday, but is hopeful an agreement will be reached with Friday as an optimal scenario.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump said plans to reopen the country are nearing completion and he will speak to all Governors shortly as well as authorise them to open states in the appropriate time and manner, which could happen for some before May 1st.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>BOC:</strong> The bank of Canada left rates unchanged at its lower bound of 0.25% as expected. The bank decided not to release its economic projections given the current situation it would not be able to provide an accurate forecast. Although it stated that bank analysis of alternative scenarios suggests the level of real activity was down 1-3% in Q1 and will be 15-30% lower in Q2 than in Q4 2019. CPI is expected to be close to 0% in Q2 2020, primarily due to the transitory effects of lower gasoline prices. The bank announced two new programmes: the Provincial Bond Purchase Program of up to CAD 50bln (2% of GDP) and the Corporate Bond Purchase Programme of CAD 10bln (0.4% of GDP); both are to be put in place in the coming weeks. Capital Economics highlighted that the size of these programmes are relatively small, and could signal any future policy moves may involve expanding these programmes. The BoC also enhanced its term repo facility to permit funding for up to 24-months, and temporarily increased the amount of Treasury Bills it acquires at auctions to up to 40% (from 20%); CapEco suggests this is aimed at improving the market function rather than increasing the budget deficit. In the press conference, outgoing Governor Poloz reiterated actions taken currently are to improve the functioning of markets, and reiterated that the BOC would stand ready to adjust the scale or duration of programs if necessary. The press conference saw little new information, although Deputy Governor Wilkins noted that credit easing is part of its tools, she did not want to speculate on any future possible use of the aforementioned tools. Governor Poloz noted rates would be very low throughout the recovery phase, and when asked about whether he would stay on as Governor (this was his last rate decision) he stated the bank is sticking with its plan to choose a successor, which is 90% done.</p><p><strong>PBOC </strong>cut the one-year rate on its Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) by 20bps to 2.95%, an all-time low. Capital Economics says the move makes it likely that the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) will decline on Monday, providing lower borrowing costs; the LPR is set by bank quotations which are then determined by a spread over the MLF. The consultancy believes another 100bps of rate reductions across policy instruments will take place this year.</p><p><strong>ECB:</strong> ECB’s Makhlouf is sceptical about a “V” shaped recovery and expects it to be more gradual. Makhlouf added the ECB is ready to support economies and citizens even further if it requires. Elsewhere, the ECB announced it supported the action taken by macroprudential authorities to address the financial sector by releasing or reducing capital buffers.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> Eurogroup head Centeno did not rule out using ‘coronabonds’ as part of a response to the COVID-19; he expects the EC to give guidance on the proposed recovery fund on April 23rd, adding that part of the fund needs to be available for Spring/Summer. Meanwhile, France is to issue EUR 245bln of medium and long-term bonds net of buybacks this year, up from the March estimate of EUR 210bln; to raise outstanding stocks of T-Bills by an additional EUR 34.6bln, according to the AFT. France had been in favour of coronabonds, although it is now raising its issuance after the Eurogroup failed to agree on such (as was expected).</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN:</strong> European Commission President von der Leyen said EU countries should use a “gradual tailor-made approach” to lifting lockdown restrictions, adding that recommendations focus on three main preconditions: 1) a significant decrease in the spread of the coronavirus; 2) sufficient health system capacity; 3) adequate surveillance and monitoring capacity. Meanwhile, according to Handelsblatt, the German government is set to extend COVID-19 restrictions until May 3rd. German Chancellor Merkel says any further relaxation of lockdown will be dependent on how the infection rate develops, little room to manoeuvre</p><p><strong>BREXIT:</strong> Brexit negotiators have conducted a video call on Wednesday to finalise next week’s large-scale trade negotiations, as well as discuss a potential extension to the transition period amid COVID-19, the Telegraph reported. However, FT said recently that the UK is holding out on providing EU with detailed fishing rights proposals which could derail approaching talks. The Express noted that the UK is pressing on with sealing a Brexit deal by the end of the year despite reservations from Brussels; EU member states have agreed that areas, where both sides agree, should not be allowed to progress too far ahead while talks stall on the more contentious areas – such as fisheries and level playing field. Surprisingly, EU27 diplomats have been told there are several areas of convergence where deals can be struck with relative ease, but ‘very, very big gaps’ still need to be bridged where both sides disagree.</p><p><strong>UK:</strong> The government, on Thursday, is likely to announce that lockdown will remain until at least May 7th. UK Health Minister later said it is clear that it is too early to make changes to lockdown measures; high deaths will continue for at least a short while. Note a COBRA meeting will take place on Thursday to determine the official government guidance.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US RETAIL SALES: </strong>Although monthly March retail sales data showed a decline deeper than analysts were expecting, some analysts took comfort in some of the internals; the control Group (which feeds into GDP) fell by 1.7%, not as bad as the -2.0% the Street was expecting. BMO said that data collection was always going to be a concern, and notes the report stated “many businesses are operating in a limited capacity or have ceased operations completely. As a result, their ability to provide accurate, timely information to Census may be limited.” Additionally, the report said “data collection is now occurring primarily via email requests and online reporting”; BMO argues that this suggests that firms that are shut down are not reporting, therefore potentially skewing the core numbers higher.</p><p><strong>EMPIRE STATE MANUFACTURING: </strong>Last month’s record dropped was usurped by the April data, which saw a record fall of 56.7 points to -78.20, way below the Street’s -35.0 expectation. To highlight the magnitude, analysts note that the low in 2008 was -34.3, making it clear that manufacturing is being hit as hard as the services sector. The sub-indices all declined, with the exception of delivery times, which rose because supply chains have shut down, Pantheon said. “The average level of the key Empire State components points to the national ISM manufacturing index falling to about 35; the December 2008 low was 34.5,” Pantheon writes, “whether that level is undershot in April or May doesn’t matter; the point is that manufacturing is in meltdown.”</p><p><strong>INDUSTRIAL/MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION:</strong> Industrial production drops by the most since 1946, consistent with manufacturing contracting by 20% annualised, Capital Economics says. US industrial production dropped by a hefty 5.4% M/M in March - deeper than the 4.0% decline analysts had expected, and the largest monthly fall since 1946, once again highlighting that the manufacturing side of the economy is being hammered as much as the services side. Manufacturing production itself fell by 6.3% M/M, also the largest monthly drop since WW2, mainly due to the fall in motor vehicle production, but every industry group saw output fall - even food and beverages, despite the panic buying seen in the month. “With many factories only being shut down in the last couple of weeks of last month, however, the March data will capture only part of the associated hit to activity,” Capital Economics says, “indeed, the collapse in the Empire State manufacturing index to a record low of -78.2 in April, from -21.5, leaves it consistent with manufacturing output falling at a 20% annualised pace.”</p><p><strong>BUSINESS INVENTORIES:</strong> Business inventories fell 0.4% in March, as expected, a slightly larger decline than the prior revised -0.3%. Oxford Economics highlights that businesses were not stocking inventories ahead of the coronavirus outbreak, noting impact on both demand and supply strains will leave inventories under pressure. It adds that “economic activity should start to rebound in the latter half of 2020, but risks are heavily tilted to the downside.”</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 0.24 LOWER AT USD 19.87/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 1.91 LOWER AT USD 27.69/BBL</strong></p><p>Crude futures continued their post-OPEC + decline on Wednesday as ballooning inventories, dismal IEA forecasts, and US data, and little risk appetite all sunk their teeth. Prices continued lower in APAC and European trade, after the bearish private US inventories report on Tuesday, and particularly after the IEA posted its gloomy monthly report today (see below). At the same time, making the losses more acute was the paring of risk appetite in equities. The selling pressure found no reprieve in the US session either as the EIA weekly report showed crude stocks (bbls) building a record 19.2mln, gasoline +5mln, distillates +6mln; production fell by 100k BPD to 12.3mln BPD, although with storage reaching capacity, the cut will make little difference to the global supply glut. Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco has offered Asian and European refineries a payment deferral for crude cargoes by up to 90 days, sources reported; at least three refiners rejected the terms due to higher financing costs. However, Saudi later claimed such reports were false. Note, in the tail end of the session (post-settlement) reports were suggesting the US is considering a plan which would pay oil producers not to produce.</p><p><strong>IEA MONTHLY OIL MARKET REPORT</strong> sees Global oil demand set to fall by a record 9.3mln BPD in 2020, potentially down by 29mln BPD in April. The report said SPR purchases could reach 200mln BPD in the next three months - still awaiting details on stock purchases. No feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near-term demand losses - “however, the past week’s achievements are a solid start.” Predicts output falls by other countries, such as the US and Canada, could be around 3.5mln amid lower prices.</p><p><strong>OPEC: </strong>Mexico will curtail production by 100k BPD in the months of May-June only, according to the Mexican Energy Minister; this is in-fitting with the OPEC+ pact announced over the weekend. OPEC initially wanted the country to cut output by 400k BPD, talks at the time hit a snag amid a rift between Saudi and Mexico. US stepped in as stated it will take some of the curtailment burden off Mexico (US committed to shoulder 250k BPD cuts on Mexico’s behalf). Meanwhile, in Russia, oil companies in the country are examining which wells they will curtail production at, looking mainly at mature fields where production was falling anyway, amid Moscow’s commitment for its largest-ever output cut, sources reported. Sources close to industry and government said that Moscow was preparing to cut its production by around 2mln BPD anyway amid the poor demand outlook.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 30 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-05.</strong></p><p>The Treasury complex bull-flattened markedly on Wednesday as risk appetite soured. The bid gained traction overnight as European trade commenced. In essence, equity futures were reversing yesterday’s strength and a dump in crude futures (a gloomy IEA report and chunky inventory builds) kept the macro narrative defensive. Then as the heavy US data slate got underway, which was dire across all accounts with “worst-ever/since” headlines bombarding screens, Treasury strength continued, although how much of the move was reactionary to the data remains a point for debate as many are looking past near-term prints. One desk noted that real money had been booking profits and selling into the Fed’s Treasury purchases, which were accompanied by hefty offer-to-cover ratios, stalling the move lower in yields in the afternoon; at the same time, the desk noted that specs and CTAs were taking the other side of the trade. USD issuance was afoot on Wednesday, likely keeping a cap on Treasury strength, where participants digested a USD 7bln three-parter from Saudi Arabia (5s, 10s, 40s), as well as lumpy, post-earnings USD 10bln launched from JPMorgan (6s, 11s, 21s, 31s). By settlement, curve spreads had flattened, with 2s -2bps at 0.20%, 10s -11bps at 0.64%, and 30s -14bps at 1.27%. Meanwhile, in STIRs, nearby Eurodollar futures rallied, with desks noting block trades in the May contract, coming amid the launch of the Fed’s CPFF, which will be supportive of the depression of USD LIBOR from its elevated levels; the move signals the market’s confidence that LIBOR will fall further in the next month or so.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -2.2% at 2783, NDX -1.15% at 8592, DJIA -1.86% at 23,504.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -4.7%, Materials -4.5%, Financials -4.37%, Real Estate -3.8%, Utilities -3.36%, Industrials -2.8%, Communication svs -2.8%, Technology -2.2%, Consumer Discretionary -1.57%, Consumer Staples -1.56%, Health Care -0.5%</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Goldman Sachs (GS) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, while Provision for credit losses were at USD 937mln (exp. 550mln, prev. 224mln). Its FICC revenue was up 33% Y/Y to 2.97bln which saw its bond trading results the strongest in five years. Although overall, results were hit by debt and equity holdings in its asset management business, but its trading topped expectations. Bank of America (BAC) also missed on EPS, revenue also fell slightly short. Loan loss provisions increased to USD 4.8bln, above estimates. BAC saw a similar story to JPM where EPS took a hit on the increased credit provisions but NII and NIM were strong at 12.13bln and 2.91%, both above expectations. In a call however, its CFO noted NII could approach 11bln in Q2 and expects the largest COVID impact on NII in Q2, and its CEO highlighted it has had an impact on every part of its business. Citi (C) beat on both EPS and revenue, while credit provisions rose to 7.03bln from 2.22bln last quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenue rose 39% to USD 4.8bln, reflecting strength in rates, currencies and commodities. Equity Markets revenue that rose 39% to USD 1.2bln with strong performance in derivatives; includes higher client activity as a result of the higher volatility. Regional bank PNC Financial (PNC) beat on EPS and revenue, NII fell Q/Q, while credit loss provisions rose 693mln to 914mln. US Bancorp (USB) missed on EPS but beat on revenue while NII declined, Provision for credit losses stood at 993mln (+600mln); note some desks highlight the regionals may have to increase its provisions in the upcoming quarters. Elsewhere, United Health (UNH) are firmer after a decent report with top and bottom-line beats while it maintained its FY EPS view, noting it does not request or plan to request any government aid.</p><p><strong>STOCK NEWS: </strong>Airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV, JBLU, ALK) firmer after the companies reached an agreement with the Treasury for payroll aid through the Payroll Support Program. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) increased its quarterly dividend by 6% to USD 0.79 and it also announced it is advancing its Q3 earnings release to April 17th from April 21st. Tesla (TSLA) China registrations rose 450% m/m to 12,079 units, according to LMC Automotive. Visa Inc.

DXY the 99 figure and saw highs around 99.80, although since a dismal slate of US data, it has pared and sits around the 99.50 handle at pixel time; yields were lower across the curve (bull-flattening) which likely limited some of the upside.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> “USDJPY hasn’t been trading well with risk sentiment recently,” Citi writes, while equities are lower today but USDJPY firmer as dollar strength dominates the Yen which saw USDJPY trade within 106.94-107.84. Citi highlight the 106.90 level as area as support which held true today, and the desk writes “if this level continues to hold, we could see the pair retest 108.30 where the 200dma converges with the horizontal resistance. However, a close below there would open the way for downside acceleration towards 104.50”.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Weighed by narrowing Bund/BTP spreads after Italy announced it would hold larger bond auctions and plans for more costly syndicated debt placements for shorter maturities to finance ramped-up spending to respond to the virus fallout. Additionally, desks continue to cite disappointment with the Eurogroup’s response package announced last week (specifically, the absence of Eurozone joint debt issuance). EURUSD however picked up off lows slightly and is now back above 109 just shy of the 50hma at 1.0942.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> Has given back some of Tuesday’s gains, which saw it rise to a fresh 7-year high.

GBPUSD failed to breach it’s 200 dma at 1.2657 (a level to keep an eye on) while some highlight strong demand beneath 1.25.

DXY the 99 figure and saw highs around 99.80, although since a dismal slate of US data, it has pared and sits around the 99.50 handle at pixel time; yields were lower across the curve (bull-flattening) which likely limited some of the upside.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> “USDJPY hasn’t been trading well with risk sentiment recently” Citi writes, while equities are lower today but USDJPY firmer as dollar strength dominates the Yen which saw USDJPY trade within 106.94-107.84. Citi highlight the 106.90 level as area as support which held true today, and the desk writes “if this level continues to hold, we could see the pair retest 108.30 where the 200dma converges with the horizontal resistance. However, a close below there would open the way for downside acceleration towards 104.50”.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>Weighed by narrowing Bund/BTP spreads after Italy announced it would hold larger bond auctions and plans for more costly syndicated debt placements for shorter maturities to finance ramped-up spending to respond to the virus fallout. Additionally, desks continue to cite disappointment with the Eurogroup's response package announced last week (specifically, the absence of Eurozone joint debt issuance). EURUSD however picked up off lows slightly and is now back above 109 just shy of the 50hma at 1.0942.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> Has given back some of Tuesday's gains, which saw it rise to a fresh 7-year high. Credit Suisse says \"the resilience of gold points to markets view that as central bank balance sheets across the world both expand in size and deteriorate in quality, gold should benefit as the ultimate of expression of resistance to likely global monetization of increasingly weak fiscal outlooks.\"</p><p><strong>CAD: </strong>The Loonie was hit in the morning as crude prices tumbled, and declines accelerated after an update form the IEA, which sees global oil demand falling by a record 9.3mln BPD, while adding that no feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near term demand losses. The BoC resulted in little by way of price action, despite announcing two new programmes (PBPP and CBPP), although the size of these are relatively small.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> After seven consecutive days of gains, the recovery has been halted by a weak consumer sentiment report and a soft risk environment. The Aussie fell beneath its 50dma around 0.6364. Participants will be eyeing jobs data later on tonight; RBC suggests that we are likely to see some impact despite the survey period being prior before the increased social distancing measures as businesses “began to stand down or shed labour amid a reduction in turnover and expectations of tougher restrictions.”</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Sterling recent rally came to a pause as risk sentiment soured seeing Cable move from highs of 1.2630 to lows of 1.2439. GBPUSD failed to breach it’s 200 dma at 1.2657 (a level to keep an eye on) while some highlight strong demand beneath 1.25.

Prices continued lower in APAC and European trade, after the bearish private US inventories report on Tuesday, and particularly after the IEA posted its gloomy monthly report today (see below). At the same time, making the losses more acute was the paring of risk appetite in equities. The selling pressure found no reprieve in the US session either as the EIA weekly report showed crude stocks (bbls) building a record 19.2mln, gasoline +5mln, distillates +6mln; production fell by 100k BPD to 12.3mln BPD, although with storage reaching capacity, the cut will make little difference to the global supply glut. Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco has offered Asian and European refineries a payment deferral for crude cargoes by up to 90 days, sources reported; at least three refiners rejected the terms due to higher financing costs. However, Saudi later claimed such reports were false.</p><p><strong>IEA MONTHLY OIL MARKET REPORT</strong> sees Global oil demand set to fall by a record 9.3mln BPD in 2020, potentially down by 29mln BPD in April. The report said SPR purchases could reach 200mln BPD in the next three months - still awaiting details on stock purchases. No feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near-term demand losses - “however, the past week’s achievements are a solid start.” Predicts output falls by other countries, such as the US and Canada, could be around 3.5mln amid lower prices.</p><p><strong>OPEC: </strong>Mexico will curtail production by 100k BPD in the months of May-June only, according to the Mexican Energy Minister; this is in-fitting with the OPEC+ pact announced over the weekend. OPEC initially wanted the country to cut output by 400k BPD, talks at the time hit a snag amid a rift between Saudi and Mexico. US stepped in as stated it will take some of the curtailment burden off Mexico (US committed to shoulder 250k BPD cuts on Mexico’s behalf). Meanwhile, in Russia, oil companies in the country are examining which wells they will curtail production at, looking mainly at mature fields where production was falling anyway, amid Moscow’s commitment for its largest-ever output cut, sources reported. Sources close to industry and government said that Moscow was preparing to cut its production by around 2mln BPD anyway amid the poor demand outlook.</p>",

The Loonie was already losing momentum before Statistics Canada released its preliminary estimate of monthly GDP for March and handed back more gains vs its US peer when the flash figure printed at -9%. Usd/Cad rebounded through 1.4100 ahead of the BoC and only pulled pack partially below the big figure when rates were left on hold as widely anticipated and the Bank announced a delay to updated MPR forecasts due exceptionally high levels of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. However, the BoC did unveil fresh policy stimulus in the form of Provincial and Corporate bond QE, while enhancing its term repo facility to offer funding for up to 2 years and raising the amount of T-bills bought by up to 40% on a temporary basis. Usd/Cad currently around 1.4100 within a wide 1.3876-1.4123 range and not as volatile as option pricing predicted over the Central Bank event via a 102 pip break-even, or during the subsequent press conference.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and Greenback in general are off best levels, but still on course for a much improved performance and ending a run of consecutive negative sessions that started before Easter when the Fed delivered another aggressive anti-coronavirus lending scheme. The DXY remains comfortably above 99.500 and almost extended its recovery to 100.000, but seems to have been thwarted by psychological resistance and the later US macro releases having held up relatively well in the face of the bleak elements in the retail sales report and collapse in NY Fed manufacturing.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars have been battling out down under for the dubious accolade of worst major performer and it’s still a close call between the high risk/beta currencies, as Aud/Usd strives to keep hold of the 0.6300 handle and Nzd/Usd hovers just below 0.6000. In short, the slide in oil and other commodities on top of overall risk aversion have undermined the Aussie and Kiwi, with the former now wary about looming jobs data.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All unable to evade the fallout from renewed Buck buying that outweighed safe-haven demand for the Yen and Franc, albeit not in terms of crosses, while the Euro topped out ahead of 1.1000 and Sterling failed to sustain 1.2600+ levels well before succumbing to RHS Eur/Gbp orders for the 4 pm London fix that countered BoE headlines about potentially bigger purchases of Sterling supranational paper and reports that UK-EU trade talks were constructive on resumption.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No shock that the Nok, Rub, Mxn and Zar were rocked by the aforementioned reversal in oil and other commodities, but the Try only stopped the rot with the aid of Turkish bank intervention following a record monthly budget deficit.</p>",

        "subject": "US EQUITY OPEN: Indices in negative territory as sentiment takes a turn for the worse with Energy and Financials lagging",
        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO:</strong> Risk-off has marked the start of Wednesday trade, US equities opened in the red by over 2%, following the downbeat tone in Europe, and Asia was mixed overnight. The Treasury curve is bull-flattening, in Europe there is a preference for the Bund over peripheral debt. Both Brent and WTI are in the red again amid continuing focus on the demand side of the equation, and today the IEA forecast global oil demand will fall to levels last seen in 1995. Gold is giving back some of Tuesday's gains, which saw it rise to 7-year highs.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>A turnaround in sentiment today sees all sectors open in negative territory with defensives (XLP, XLV) the relative outperformers, and Health Care’s (XLV) losses limited by United Health (UNH) after its solid earnings report. However, Energy and Financials the underperformers with the former tracking the crude complex while the latter continues to see disappointment from earnings. Airlines are mostly green after striking a deal with the government for a bailout late Tuesday.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Goldman Sachs (GS) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, while Provision for credit losses were at USD 937mln (exp. 550mln, prev. 224mln). Its FICC revenue was up 33% Y/Y to 2.97bln which saw its bond trading results the strongest in five years. Although overall, results were hit by debt and equity holdings in its asset management business, but its trading topped expectations. Bank of America (BAC) also missed on EPS, revenue also fell slightly short. Loan loss provisions increased to USD 4.8bln, above estimates. BAC saw a similar story to JPM where EPS took a hit on the increased credit provisions but NII and NIM were strong at 12.13bln and 2.91%, both above expectations. In a call however, its CFO noted NII could approach 11bln in Q2 and expects the largest COVID impact on NII in Q2, and its CEO highlighted it has had an impact on every part of its business. Citi (C) beat on both EPS and revenue, while credit provisions rose to 7.03bln from 2.22bln last quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenue rose 39% to USD 4.8bln, reflecting strength in rates, currencies and commodities. Equity Markets revenue that rose 39% to USD 1.2bln with strong performance in derivatives; includes higher client activity as a result of the higher volatility. Regional bank PNC Financial (PNC) beat on EPS and revenue, NII fell Q/Q, while credit loss provisions rose 693mln to 914mln. US Bancorp (USB) missed on EPS but beat on revenue while NII declined, Provision for credit losses stood at 993mln (+600mln); note some desks highlight the regional banks may have to increase its provisions in the upcoming quarters. Elsewhere, United Health (UNH) are firmer after a decent report with top and bottom-line beats while it maintained its FY EPS view, noting it does not request or plan to request any government aid.</p><p><strong>STOCK STORIES:</strong> Airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL, LUV, JBLU, ALK) &nbsp;mostly firmer after the companies reached an agreement with the Treasury for payroll aid through the Payroll Support Program. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) increased its quarterly dividend by 6% to USD 0.79 and it also announced it is advancing its Q3 earnings release to April 17th from April 21st. Tesla (TSLA) China registrations rose 450% m/m to 12,079 units, according to LMC Automotive. Visa Inc. (V) &amp; Mastercard (MA) were downgraded to Hold from Buy at Jefferies.</p><p><strong>TECHNICALS:</strong> Credit Suisse' technicians note SPX resistance between 2,855-2,934 (coinciding with 61.8% of the Q1 collapse); NDX has cleared 8,572 resistance, opening the door to 9,000-9,102 (neckline of the Q1 top, and also around the 78.6% of the Q1 collapse) where it expects the index to attempt a top.</p><p><strong>VIRUS CATALYSTS:</strong> As we have noted earlier in the week, analysts have been moving on from the case count and death toll; while a trend decline from peak rates is important, re-opening economies and seeing no signs of reinfections, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments is likely to drive the next leg higher. These conversations are occurring, and while there is the political distraction of US President Trump arguing with state governors, the conversation has begun not only in the US, but in other key markets around the world. Meanwhile on the treatment front, while many note that there are numerous treatments in development, these are only expected to be available to the wider markets in months (at minimum). Additionally, it is worth paying attention to commentary from large employers about when they intend to get their staff back into action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>QUANT VIEW:</strong> The playbook of Nomura's quant desk - which we have covered quite a bit in recent notes - seems to be unfolding as planned, and they today reiterate their view for an ongoing natural rebound away from earlier pessimism, with the sustained downtrend in volatility inducing systematic buying by CTAs and risk-parity funds through to 22nd April in the NDX; Nomura says CTAs are relatively flat in SPX positioning, and expect that they will add to SPX longs in the next few days. However, looking at the sector performance, Nomura notes it has been the rally has been kept alive by large caps, and not a preference for higher-risk investment targets such as small caps, high-beta stocks, and value stocks. \"We think investors would do well to keep in mind that when overdone pessimism corrects itself in the way we are currently seeing in US equities, there is no guarantee that the market will make the leap into outright optimism,\" the bank writes.</p>",

Nonetheless, the momentum petered out in Asia trade with <strong>ASX 200 (-0.4%)</strong> dragged lower by heavy losses in the energy sector after WTI crude prices dipped another 7% and briefly tested the USD 20.00/bbl level on demand concerns and with financials subdued after poor earnings results from their stateside peers. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.5%)</strong> exporters were hampered by the ill-effects of a firmer currency and amid the global production shutdown extensions, while <strong>KOSPI </strong>remained closed for National Assembly elections which is seen as a referendum for President Moon and the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%)</strong> traded rangebound and conformed to the indecisive regional tone despite PBoC’s efforts in which it conducted a CNY 100bln 1-year Medium-term Lending Facility at a reduced rate of 2.95% (Prev. 3.15%), while the first phase of its previously announced 100bps targeted RRR cut took effect today but this was also unsuccessful in spurring momentum. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured from the open and proceeded lower before finding support near the 152.00 level, while the BoJ Rinban announcement provided little inspiration with the central bank only in the market for JPY 400bln in up to 3yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC conducted CNY 100bln 1-year Medium-term Lending Facility at 2.95% vs. Prev. 3.15%.

(FT)</p><p>The UK is pressing on with sealing a Brexit deal by the end of the year despite reservations from Brussels, according to Express' Barnes; EU member states have agreed that areas where both sides agree should not be allowed to progress too far ahead while talks stall on the more contentious areas – such as fisheries and level playing field. Surprisingly, EU27 diplomats have been told there are a number of areas of convergence where deals can be struck with relative ease, but 'very, very big gaps' still need to be bridged where both sides disagree.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities extend on losses seen at the cash open (Euro Stoxx 50 -2.1%),</strong> after a similarly (albeit to a lesser extent) handover from Asia, as the positive sentiment all Wall Street U-turned overnight. US equity futures also succumb to the broad risk aversion, with E-Mini S&amp;P and Dow June futures back below the 2800 and 23500 marks respectively heading into more earnings. Back to Europe, bourses see broad-based losses with FTSE 100 (-2.4%) seeing more pronounced downside among the majors as the index is pressured by its large-cap Energy, Financial and Material names – three sectors which see steep losses in Europe, with the former the laggard amid price action in the energy complex. Similarly, financials suffer amid the lower yield environment and materials fall due to declines across the base metals. The sectors also clearly reflect risk aversion, as defensive fare considerably better than the cyclicals. In terms of the sector breakdown, Oil &amp; Gas reside at the bottom, followed by the Travel &amp; Leisure as lockdowns across some countries are set to be extended. In terms of individual movers. ASML (-1.8%) conformed to the decline in the region after opening higher post-earnings, in which its revenue and net printed relatively in-line with estimates, whilst suspending its Q2 buybacks but keeping its three-year programme intact. The CEO also noted that demand outlook is currently unchanged, and the group has not encountered any pushouts or cancellations this year, the group’s order intake remains strong. Sticking with earnings, TomTom (-7.3%) sees hefty losses amid dismal earnings after missing on all its company compiled estimates, withdrawing guidance and suspending share buybacks indefinitely. Finally, Adidas (-1.9%) received approval for a syndicated EUR 3bln loan from KFW contingent on a suspension of dividends.</p><p><strong>UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) </strong>Q1 20 (USD): Adj.

Prices saw renewed pressure upon the release of the IEA Monthly Oil Market Report which stated that global oil demand is set to fall by a record 9.3mln BPD in 2020. Both the EIA and IEA unsurprisingly cut world oil demand outlook, although the latter by a considerably larger amount than the former, which forecasts a fall of 5.6mln BPD this year. The Agency also stated that it can reach SPR purchases of 200mln BPD over the next three months – a longer timeframe than the touted 2 months by the Saudi Energy Minister. The report also echoed some recent comments from IEA Chief Birol, stating that no feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset the near-term decline in demand.

Meanwhile, the weekly Private Inventories added further fuel to the bearish bias after printing a larger-than-expected build of 13.1mln vs. Exp. +11.7mln.

US equity futures also succumb to the broad risk aversion, with E-Mini S&amp;P and Dow June futures back below the 2800 and 23500 marks respectively heading into more earnings. Back to Europe, bourses see broad-based losses with FTSE 100 (-2.4%) seeing more pronounced downside among the majors as the index is pressured by its large-cap Energy, Financial and Material names – three sectors which see steep losses in Europe, with the former the laggard amid price action in the energy complex. Similarly, financials suffer amid the lower yield environment and materials fall due to declines across the base metals. The sectors also clearly reflect risk aversion, as defensive fare considerably better than the cyclicals. In terms of the sector breakdown, Oil &amp; Gas reside at the bottom, followed by the Travel &amp; Leisure as lockdowns across some countries are set to be extended. In terms of individual movers. ASML (-1.8%) conformed to the decline in the region after opening higher post-earnings, in which its revenue and net printed relatively in-line with estimates, whilst suspending its Q2 buybacks but keeping its three-year programme intact. The CEO also noted that demand outlook is currently unchanged, and the group has not encountered any pushouts or cancellations this year, the group’s order intake remains strong. Sticking with earnings, TomTom (-7.3%) sees hefty losses amid dismal earnings after missing on all its company compiled estimates, withdrawing guidance and suspending share buybacks indefinitely. Finally, Adidas (-1.9%) received approval for a syndicated EUR 3bln loan from KFW contingent on a suspension of dividends.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar was already clawing back losses across the board, but in particular relative to high beta and commodity based counterparts as Gold lost its lustre above Usd 1750/oz, but a more pronounced pull-back in crude prices following a bearish IEA monthly report gave the Greenback an extra fillip with the DXY back within striking distance of 99.500 compared to 98.828 lows.

        "subject": "[RE-POST] PRIMER: BOC rate decision on 15th April 2020 at 1000 ET/1500 BST; press conference at 1030 ET/1530 BST",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>A WORD ABOUT THE RELEASE: </strong>There will be no media lock-in due to Ontario’s ban on gatherings of five or more people amid COVID-19. Accordingly, the release will likely trickle through newswires in a slower fashion than we are usually used to, and this may result in volatility around the release, Scotiabank says, especially if new programmes are introduced. Rate decision and Monetary Policy Report are due at 1000 ET/1500 BST; press conference with Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins at 1030 ET/1530 BST.</li><li><strong>BOS:</strong> The Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey was deemed rather stale given the majority of interviews were conducted before coronavirus concerns intensified, although it still showed that confidence had slipped even before the COVID-19 shock (the survey was conducted between 11/Feb to 6/Mar, meaning the Large-Scale Asset Purchases from the BOC and measures from the government at the end of March will not have been encapsulated). The BOC said that more recent consultations indicated sales have collapsed for businesses in consumer-oriented industries and energy firms have experienced a dramatic increase in economic and financial stress, and believe the current shock is worse than that seen in 2008 and 2015. It is therefore slightly tricky in making any policy inferences for the BOC’s next policy meeting, as is usually the case with the survey.</li><li><strong>RATES:</strong> All analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect the bank will keep its Policy Interest Rate unchanged at 0.25%. After three 50bps rate cuts in March, the rate now stands at what officials consider to be the effective lower bound­, and no further rate cuts are expected at this stage, given the Bank has been averse to negative rates; indeed, money markets are pricing in the rate at current levels through the end of this year.</li><li><strong>BOND PURCHASES:</strong> The BOC has also announced purchases of government bonds (measures which the governor framed as “market functioning” rather than QE)., which have been showing initial signs of success, analysts have said. Capital Economics thinks the next step is for the BOC to boost its commercial bonds purchases, if it makes any tweaks at all; although given the programme has only just begun, it may be too soon for the BOC to have judged the progress fully. In the event there are only tweaks to the programme, analysts will be looking for clues on how long the Bank intends to run its programmes (CapEco thinks one year, with purchases of around CAD 150bln).</li><li><strong>PROVINCIAL BONDS: </strong>Others suggest that there is a possibility that the BOC might eventually expand its purchases to include the bonds of provinces. Any further action would likely be carried out in coordination with the fiscal authorities, and the press conference on Wednesday may provide the perfect suite of communications tools for doing more. Scotia writes if the BOC were to buy provincial bonds and talk about extending the purchases of government bonds, “then potentially hundreds more billions of dollars of stimulus could be added into the Canadian financial system in an effort to further force monetary stimulus through the cracks in the financial system.”</li><li><strong>MPR:</strong> Elsewhere, there will be less focus on the updated economic projections, which will likely see downward revisions, though subject to significant uncertainty given the poor visibility around how the COVID-19 outbreak will be resolved. Nevertheless, analysts do not think the projections will be consistent with the BOC withdrawing policy support any time soon. “Regardless of exactly what they choose to do within a list of multiple options, the BOC has cover in a devastating jobs report , and also has cover in their inflation mandate as this shock likely proves itself to be more of a demand than supply shock at least for a time, making the feasible return to a closed output gap something that is probably at the tail end of its forecast horizon or quite likely beyond,” Scotiabank writes, “what is not lost among all of this continues to be rising concern toward how global governments and central banks extricate themselves from massive stimulus when the time comes to do so.”</li><li><strong>NEW GOVERNOR: </strong>Finally, there will also be focus on succession at the helm of the Bank; this will be the last meeting before Governor Poloz’ term as Governor ends on 2nd June, and he has stated that he intends to step down as planned; there is speculation that Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins will get the promotion.</li><li><i>NOTE: This report was initially published on 14th April 2020</i></li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar was already clawing back losses across the board, but in particular relative to high beta and commodity based counterparts as Gold lost its lustre above Usd 1750/oz, but a more pronounced pull-back in crude prices following a bearish IEA monthly report gave the Greenback an extra fillip with the <strong>DXY</strong> back within striking distance of 99.500 compared to 98.828 lows. However, the index may encounter some technical resistance around recent recovery highs and run in to fundamental hurdles given bleak forecasts for upcoming US retail sales and ip data, not to mention the downside bias vs consensus.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN</strong></p><p>Aside from renewed risk aversion fuelled by the aforementioned about-turn in oil and metals, the Aussie has been undermined independently by a sharp deterioration in consumer sentiment per Westpac’s April survey, while the Kiwi is down in sympathy even though the Aud/Nzd cross has reversed from circa 1.0570 towards 1.0500. Aud/Usd got tantalisingly close to a hefty 1 bn 0.6450 option expiry at one stage, but now appears more inclined to hit 0.6300 and Nzd/Usd is even nearer 0.6000 from 0.6100+ overnight. Elsewhere, the Loonie is back below 1.4000 vs 1.3876 and still nervous ahead of the BoC, Eur/Nok is hovering just shy of 11.5000, Usd/Rub is pivoting 74.0000 and Usd/Mxn is paring back following a marginal breach of 23.9800.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Also victims of the Buck’s broad revival, but to varying degrees as Cable reverses from 1.2630 to test 1.2500 and the Euro wanes 10 pips or so before 1.1000 to 1.0920, though not far enough to disturb decent expiry interest between 1.0890-1.0900 (1.3 bn). However, Eur/Usd may lose more momentum on a closing basis if the pair cannot reclaim 1.0950 and a Fib level just above, while the Pound will be eyeing the resumption of Brexit trade negotiations with the EU. Turning to the Franc, gains vs the Dollar have been eroded within a 0.9597-0.9648 range, but not against the single currency as prior support around 1.0550 seems to be morphing into a Eur/Chf cap. Similarly, the Yen has retained a solid safe-haven premium in cross terms, but Usd/Jpy failed to extend through 107.00 and subsequently rebounded to 107.50 or so amidst reports of fresh long positions being instigated on trading platforms.</p><p><strong>SEK/EM</strong></p><p>Firmer than expected Swedish CPI metrics have helped the Swedish Krona evade much of the general risk-off positioning, but no such luck for Lira or Rand with the latter succumbing to further heavy post-SARB rate cut depreciation in wake of the SA Government supposedly reneging on wage deals according to the PSU.</p>",

Nonetheless, the momentum petered out in Asia trade with <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%)</strong> dragged lower by heavy losses in the energy sector after WTI crude prices dipped another 7% and briefly tested the USD 20.00/bbl level on demand concerns and with financials subdued after poor earnings results from their stateside peers. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.2%)</strong> exporters were hampered by the ill-effects of a firmer currency and amid the global production shutdown extensions, while <strong>KOSPI </strong>remained closed for National Assembly elections which is seen as a referendum for President Moon and the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.1%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured from the open and proceeded lower before finding support near the 152.00 level, while the BoJ Rinban announcement provided little inspiration with the central bank only in the market for JPY 400bln in up to 3yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC conducted CNY 100bln 1-year Medium-term Lending Facility at 2.95% vs. Prev. 3.15%.

(FT)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> remained lacklustre after having recently slipped below the 99.00 level amid easing funding pressures and declining yields, but with price action overnight muted alongside mixed trade seen in its major counterparts. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated around the prior day’s highs after taking out several key MA levels including the 50DMA at 1.0967 and GBP/USD retraced some of this week’s gains although just about held on to the 1.2600 handle. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> briefly fell below support at 107.00 and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were also pressured by the cautious risk tone, while antipodeans were hampered by their high-beta statuses, the ongoing oil rout and weak Australian consumer confidence data with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> homing in on 0.6400 to the downside.</p><p>Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence Index (Apr) 75.6 (Prev. 91.9).

(FT)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX grinded higher through the session, despite an equity rally and amid returning liquidity conditions. The T-Note found support in APAC trade after a sell-off (in both equities and bonds) on Easter Monday, and liquidity helped to sustain the moves. Strong gains in the equity complex on Tuesday did little to change the dial either, with equities, gold and Treasuries rising in unison. Further, with the Fed paring back its daily purchases this week (average daily pace of USD 30bln vs 50bln last week), the appetite for USTs remains strong. The strength could be a function of equity hedges, as some desks view the stock market’s retracement as reaching peak “realistic” levels with corporate earnings depressed: BofA’s FMS recommended taking profits in the SPX between 2,850-3,000; survey respondents also noted long US Treasuries as the most crowded trade. Investors may also have been discomforted by the IMF’s latest gloomy assessment of the global economy on track to suffer the worst since the Depression. Additionally, JPMorgan’s and Wells Fargo’s Q1 earnings reports both caught participants off-guard with the extent of their loan provisions, shining a light on the extent of financial pain the wider economy is facing. However, the fiscal and monetary backstops being implemented will limit such extremes. By settlement, major spreads were slightly steeper, 2s -2bps at 0.22%, 10s unchanged at 0.75% and 30s +2 at 1.41%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 4+ ticks higher at 138-07.</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (non-voter, hawk)</strong> said the economy has a tough path ahead of it but added the Fed is willing to be creative and innovative with support efforts. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bostic (non-voter, dove)</strong> said he is confident support will reach businesses on time but added that more is likely needed for small businesses, local government, and GIG economy workers. (Yahoo Finance)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (non-voter, dove)</strong> said the US should get down to a low number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the weeks ahead, while he reiterated the Fed is willing to do more if other markets experience trouble. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Evans (non-voter, dove)</strong> said the US economy will recover in H2 but there is a risk it could be delayed, while he added there is no way you could have insured against this shock and noted there is a part for the government to socialise the costs. (Newswires)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said several US airlines will participate in the payroll support program including American Airlines (AAL) Delta (DAL) and United (UAL), while discussions continue with other airlines about potential aid, while other reports noted that Delta (DAL) said it it will receive USD 5.4bln in Treasury grants. (Newswires)</p><p>US Small Business Administration said more than 1mln loans have been approved through the payroll protection program as of April 13th with approvals totalling USD 247.5bln from over 4600 lenders. (Newswires)</p><p>US congressional sources said they are working with SBA on expansion of pandemic relief for small businesses and are looking to get USD 16bln in grants and USD 50bln in loans for Economic Injury Disaster Loans in the next phase, as the first USD 10bln round is nearly depleted. Furthermore, US Democrat Senator Doug Jones understands a fair amount of progress has been made in discussions between Senate Democrat Leader Schumer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on extending the small-business Paycheck Protection Program funding, while he commented that we may be seeing some packages pretty soon.

Nonetheless, the momentum has petered out in Asia trade with ASX 200 (-0.5%) dragged by heavy losses in the energy sector after WTI crude prices dipped another 7% and briefly tested the USD 20.00/bbl level on demand concerns and with financials subdued after poor earnings results from their stateside peers. Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) exporters suffer the ill-effects of a firmer currency and amid the global production shutdown extensions, while KOSPI remains closed for National Assembly elections which is seen as a referendum for President Moon and the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) trade rangebound and conform to the indecisive regional tone despite PBoC’s efforts in which it conducted a CNY 100bln 1-year Medium-term Lending Facility at a reduced rate of 2.95% (Prev. 3.15%), while the first phase of its previously announced 100bps targeted RRR cut took effect today but this was also unsuccessful in spurring momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains lacklustre after having recently slipped below the 99.00 level amid easing funding pressures and declining yields, but with price action overnight muted alongside mixed trade seen in its major counterparts. EUR/USD consolidates around the prior day’s highs after taking out several key MA levels including the 50DMA at 1.0967 and GBP/USD retraces some of this week’s gains although still holds on to the 1.2600 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY briefly fell below support at 107.00 and JPY-crosses were also pressured by the cautious risk tone, while antipodeans are hampered by their high-beta statuses, the ongoing oil rout and weak Australian consumer confidence data with AUD/USD homing in on 0.6400 to the downside.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured from the open and proceeded lower before finding support near the 152.00 level, while the BoJ Rinban announcement provided little inspiration with the central bank only in the market for JPY 400bln in up to 3yr maturities.</p>",
