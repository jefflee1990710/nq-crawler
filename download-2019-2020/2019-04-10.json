The Minutes also noted that some policymakers thought a modest hike could be warranted later this year and several policymakers said their view could change on the Fed's next move whether that should be a hike or a cut. (Newswires)</p><p>Furthermore, several policymakers preferred to stabilise reserves by resuming treasury purchases soon after balance sheet runoff and some suggested to discuss cost benefits of tools to reduce reserves demand and support interest rate control. Policymakers also saw continued US economic growth, strong labour market and inflation near the Fed's objective as the most likely outcome in the next few years, while several expressed concern over the flat yield curve, but highlighted that the historical relationship is less reliable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said they had a very productive meeting with Chinese officials, while he added that a call is scheduled for tomorrow morning and there are still important issues to address. Mnuchin also noted that an enforcement mechanism has been agreed and that the sides will set up enforcement offices. (Newswires/FT)</p><p>Australian PM Morris is said to be on the way to government house and is expected to call an election which must be held by 18th May 2019 for half-Senate and 2nd November 2019 for the House of Representatives.

Furthermore, most EU27 states reportedly support a long extension to the Brexit and the EU was said to be angling towards a 9-12month Brexit extension. However, French President Macron was said to be pushing for a Brexit extension to the end of June and a French Presidency official also noted their view is that current Brexit documents being drafted do not include serious guarantees which does not allow for a long extension. (Newswires)</p><p>UK government sources stated that UK PM May will make a statement on the results of her meeting with EU leaders at midday tomorrow and that MPs are unlikely to be asked to attend House of Commons next week although this has not been confirmed.

Draghi added Euro area growth risks are tilted to the downside and that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still required, while he also commented that the central bank is in the process of analysing the impacts of negative rates on bank profits.</p><p>ECB's Draghi also commented that TLTRO details will be announced in forthcoming meetings and will take into account assessment of bank-based transmission, while they will consider whether preservation of negative rates requires mitigation. However, Draghi also commented that it is too early to discuss terms of the TLTRO or to decide about tiering which needs further analysis, while they also did not discuss rate guidance and the main goal of the meeting was to reassert readiness to act if needed.</p><p>EU's Dombrovskis said EU is discussing trade issues with US and is hopeful the sides avoid an escalation of trade tensions, while Dombrovskis also noted they have seen some slowdown in the bloc's economies and that the Italian slowdown is partly due to government decisions.

Levi Strauss (LEVI) surged on its debut public earnings release, where it showed strong advances in top and bottom line growth. Conagra Brands (CAG) outperformed following an investor presentation where it provided optimistic guidance. Delta Air Lines (DAL) opened higher on strong earnings and improved revenue guidance. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) nosedived after Evercore downgraded the drug distributor on profit concerns. Disney (DIS) received a tailwind from BMO Capital upgrading and raising the price target for the stock. Chipmakers (AMD, XLNX, INTC) caught a bid amidst a bullish research note on the sector from Cowen, who sees the sector recovering in H2 2019. Automakers, particularly Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM), gained upward momentum following US lawmakers suggesting a bill for increased tax credits for electric vehicles. Kroger (KR) benefitted from a positive mention at Credit Suisse, who see robust profit ahead. Nordstrom (JWN) traded higher after KeyBanc upgraded the apparel retailer. Jet Blue Airways (JBLU) took off on improved March traffic and the teasing of a new transatlantic route. Under Armour (UAA) opened in the green with thanks to an upgrade at Citi. SPX +0.4% at 2889, NDX +0.6% at 7611, DJI 0.0% at 26160.</p><p>Decent IP data out of Europe helped the TPLEX find sellers in the premarket, though buyers emerged ahead of the US cash equity open. A mixed CPI report (headline up, core down) saw a chunky block in the TY June contract. After the data, ECB President Draghi’s reiteration of downside risks saw the T-note move in sympathy with the Bund, sending Treasuries to 1-week highs. There was a breather after the European cash close, where book squaring was reported ahead of the 10-year auction. The auction itself was fairly good, stopping through the screens by 1bps, while indirect bidder participation provided some encouragement. The Fed’s latest meeting minutes stuck to the script, though perhaps weren’t as dovish as some might have predicted after the outcome of the March policy meeting. That left major curve spreads mixed at settlement. US T-note futures (M9) settled 5 ticks higher at 123-25+.</p>",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 10 April 2019: Minutes suggest Fed did not discuss rate cuts at March meeting",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities up, dollar down, Treasuries up, crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> Fed mins slightly more hawkish than expected; US headline CPI beats, core dips; ECB remains cautious, and vague on TLTRO3 details; New BCB Governor Neto on the outlook; More bearish OPEC monthly report;</p><p><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>Chinese, German &amp; French CPI; US Initial Jobless Claims &amp; PPI; New Zealand Manufacturing PMI; IEA Monthly Report; ECB's de Galhua; Fed's Clarida, Bullard, Williams, Kashkari &amp; Bowman; Supply from US &amp; Italy</p><p><strong>* FOMC: </strong>There was nothing in the Fed meeting minutes to suggest that the central bank was on the cusp of cutting rates. In fact, the majority of officials see rates steady this year, while the patient approach was needed amid uncertainties that include the global economy, trade and Brexit (policymakers wanted to review this ‘patient’ stance regularly). Some even thought that modest rate rises might be warranted later in the year, while several said they could shift their view on whether the next appropriate move should be a rate hike or cut (note: in the Fed’s March forecasts, it took rate hikes off the table for the rest of the year). There was not much on the balance sheet for traders to get their teeth into. On the economic outlook, the Fed saw continued US economic growth (Q1 weakness likely transitory), strong labour market and inflation near target as the most likely outcome in the next few years. There were some concerns expressed on the yield curve, but policymakers noted that the historical relationship with growth is less reliable. Net/net, the minutes reiterate the view that the Fed is firmly on hold, and that if data comes in in line with expectations, the next move could be up. This may have disappointed the doves, who were looking to the meeting minutes for evidence that the Fed was/may consider cutting rates in the months ahead, as US President Donald Trump and his Fed Board nominee Stephen Moore have called for. The probability of a rate cut was relatively unchanged in wake of the minutes, according to money markets, which imply a 55% chance of a rate cut; some have argued that there is little in the economic landscape that makes a compelling case for rate cuts at present, and as such the pricing could be a reflection of the market’s view that we are at/near the end of the cycle; it could also be a function of threats to the Fed’s independence from the Trump administration, which prefers lower rates. Either way, there is not much in the minutes that significantly shifts the Fed’s narrative, and as such, it will be in wait and see mode in the weeks/potentially months ahead.</p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>Headline CPI rose 0.4% M/M, beating the forecast 0.3%, helping to boost the Y/Y measure by 0.1ppts to 1.9% in March. The Core measure fell 0.1% M/M vs +0.2% expected, dragging the Y/Y measure down 0.1ppts to 2.0%. The core measure was held back by a fall in apparel prices, and excluding this item, the core measure rose by 0.2% M/M. Pantheon Macroeconomics says the fall might have been a result of a change in the data collection methodology, and the consultancy said it may be a one-off. \"Elsewhere, the components responsible for most of the modest 0.1% core increase in February - medical services, recreation, and medical commodities - rebounded in March, at least in part, but used auto prices fell for the second straight month, by 0.4%,\" Pantheon writes, \"The CPI used auto measure remains much stronger than implied by auction price data, so we expect further declines.\" But in contrast, the consultancy says that rents are rising strongly, well above trend and the biggest increase since February 2007. \"This might just be noise, and we note that owners' equivalent rents rose less quickly, up 0.32%,\" but the consultancy is reluctant to dismiss the numbers since \"the dip in the vacancy rate to a 34-year low, coupled with faster wage growth, is consistent with the idea that rental inflation will rise,\" and \"the three-month annualized rate of increase of combined primary rents and OER reached 3.9% in March, the fastest increase on this basis since June 2016. It could easily mean-revert quickly to the prior trend, 3.3%, but rents account for 41% of the core CPI so the data need to be watched closely.\"</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Appearing on CNBC, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had a very productive meeting with Chinese officials and has a further call scheduled for tomorrow morning. He said that although there were still important issues to be addressed, an enforcement mechanism, which had previously been a sticking point, had been agreed upon. He gave no detail regarding a timeline for tariff removal but did go on to say that US President Trump is ready and willing to meet with China President Xi and reiterated that the Trump administration is working full-time on the deal.</p><p><strong>* ECB REVIEW:</strong> As was touted ahead of the release, this week’s ECB policy announcement provided little in the way of fireworks with all three key rates maintained and no changes to the monetary policy statement. As such, a bulk of the focus fell upon the follow-up press conference with President Draghi. In his assessment of the Eurozone economy, Draghi noted that incoming data is weak, reflecting external demand and country specific factors, adding that the impact of these factors is longer lasting. Ultimately, the ECB Chief maintained his assessment that Euro area growth risks are tilted to the downside. On the inflation front, the Governing Council noted that underlying inflation is muted with headline inflation likely to decline over the coming months but expected to increase over the medium-term. During the Q&amp;A segment of the press conference, Draghi noted that he wishes to dispel the notion that the ECB will tolerate low inflation and that policymakers are committed to returning inflation towards 2% without delay and ultimately, the 2% goal is not a ceiling. Naturally, journalists looked to extract more details from the President on TLTRO3, however, Draghi batted away such efforts by stating that details will be announced in forthcoming meetings. The ECB Chief also took a similar approach to the prospect of topic of prospective tiered rates at the Bank, however, did acknowledge that policymakers will need to consider whether or not the preservation of negative interest rates requires mitigation. From a rate guidance perspective, despite the account of the March meeting stating that some policymakers wanted to push guidance out further into 2020 (as opposed to end of 2019), Draghi suggested that such a move was not discussed at this meeting and instead the purpose of the meeting was to reassert the Bank’s readiness to act if needed with the President noting that “we are ready to use all instruments”. Overall, ING concludes “The ECB first wants to spend more time in the study room before announcing details of the new TLTROs or even presenting measures to bring relief to the banks”.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> There was nothing fresh on the Brexit front; May delivered a pitch to EU leaders which was reportedly more solid than usual, though there weren’t many specifics, and EU officials after said there was a sense that May might be open to a longer Brexit extension, as long as it can be ended early. The draft conclusions of the EU27 statement will likely include language giving the EU permission to have more meetings without the UK during the extension process, and are to say that the UK should refrain from any measure which could jeopardise EU objectives. Behind the scenes, there were reports that France and Germany were split about the length of the Article 50 extensions, with the French continuing to want a shorter extension, though the Germans seemed more amenable – as they have in recent weeks – to ensuring the process is smooth, without issues, and more supportive of longer extensions (a 9-month to 12-month extension is reportedly being mulled, while a French official was quoted as saying that the current Brexit documents do not include serious guarantees, which would not allow for a long extension in France’s view) There was some chatter that the May press conference has been brought forward slightly, which may indicate that ‘things are going to plan’ one reporter said.</p><p><strong>* BCB:</strong> New governor Campos Neto was on the wires, noting that the international outlook remains challenging, and the risk profile is shifting, while risks were still tilted towards lower growth, and that while the recovery is gradual, it is not quite as monetary authorities had expected. Campos Neto made pro-business noises, saying he was working to reduce the cost of financial transactions and improving competitions. He also said he wants to simplify the foreign exchange market, with the aim of having a fully convertible currency, arguing that if reforms are done correctly, the BRL might strengthen as a result; he said there was no target for the FX rate. He also said that the FX reserves policy has been a very good insurance policy, at a minimum cost. On the central bank's objectives, Campos Neto said the mission is to achieve the inflation target, not growth, adding that the BCB would not take risks with keeping inflation under control. The central bank chief also noted that challenges faced by fiscal policy: pension reforms, public sector salaries, and interest on debt. The BCB's base case is tat the reforms will be approved, and will analyse the impact it has on FX reserve policy.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> OPEC crude production fell 534k bpd in March to average 30.02mln bpd. Compliance of members bound by supply cut deal reported at 155% (exp. 135%). Crude oil output decreased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq, while production increased in Libya, Congo and Nigeria. Venezuela tells OPEC production fell by 472k BPD to 960k BPD, a new long-term low, amid US sanctions and blackouts. Total world oil demand growth in 2018 is estimated at 1.41mln bpd, down 20k bpd from last month’s estimate due to weaker Q4 2018 oil demand data from OECD Asia-Pac. For 2019, oil demand growth is forecast at around 1.21mln bpd vs last month’s 1.24mln bpd forecast due to slower-than-expected economic activity, the EIA also cut its 2019 world oil demand growth. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2018 was revised up by 160k bpd from the previous month’s report. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2019 was revised lower by 60k bpd to average 2.18mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (K9) SETTLE USD AT USD; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD AT USD. </strong>The oil complex marched forward on Wednesday to re-test YTD highs seen earlier in the week. The US energy inventory data is bound to have muddied the waters for participants, where crude stocks built by a hefty 7mln bbls, above the expected 2.3mln build and superseding the API reported 4.1mln build; however, gasoline stocks moved in the opposite direction, drawing by 7.7mln bbls, greater than the expected 2.3mln draw; the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub also reported stocks drawing by 1.1mln bbls. Price movements were choppy after the release. It's worth keeping in mind that the energy complex is underpinned by supply-side woes emanating from conflicts in Libya, markets are pricing in a potential disruption. El-Sharara oil field is currently producing under capacity (290k vs. full capacity of 300-315k), whilst an explosion occurred near a pipeline that connect El-Feel oilfield (340k) to Zawiya port (scheduled to load 6mln barrels in April). Recent ICE &amp; CME data continues to show long positions expanding in WTI and Brent, with analysts at PVM noting, “a word of caution is in order. The current overhang of speculative length in both crude markers could spark a downward spiral in oil prices. That is if the uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook and OPEC+ production strategy in the second half of the year intensifies. You’ve been warned.” Elsewhere, there were signs that the WTI/Brent arb is weighing on US exports, which declined to 2.35mln BPD in the week (vs 2.7mln last week).</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.4% at 2889, NDX +0.6% at 7611, DJI 0,0% at 26160. SECTORS: Communications +1.2%, Cons Discretionary +0.5%, Cons Staples +0.3%, Energy +0.4%, Financials +0.3%, Healthcare +0.1%, Industrials 0.0%, Materials 0.0%, Tech +0.7%, Telecoms +0.3%, Utilities -0.4%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) was a dragger on indices again today after it reported a big fall in 737 MAX orders in March as well as receiving a price target lowering at JPMorgan. Levi Strauss (LEVI) surged on its debut public earnings release, where it showed strong advances in top and bottom line growth. Conagra Brands (CAG) outperformed following an investor presentation where it provided optimistic guidance. Delta Air Lines (DAL) opened higher on strong earnings and improved revenue guidance. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) nosedived after Evercore downgraded the drug distributor on profit concerns. Disney (DIS) received a tailwind from BMO Capital upgrading and raising the price target for the stock. Chipmakers (AMD, XLNX, INTC) caught a bid amidst a bullish research note on the sector from Cowen, who sees the sector recovering in H2 2019. Automakers, particularly Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM), gained upward momentum following US lawmakers suggesting a bill for increased tax credits for electric vehicles. Kroger (KR) benefitted from a positive mention at Credit Suisse, who see robust profit ahead. Nordstrom (JWN) traded higher after KeyBanc upgraded the apparel retailer. Jet Blue Airways (JBLU) took off on improved March traffic and the teasing of a new transatlantic route. Under Armour (UAA) opened in the green with thanks to an upgrade at Citi.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 5 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-25+. </strong>Decent IP data out of Europe helped the TPLEX find sellers in the premarket, though buyers emerged ahead of the US cash equity open. A mixed CPI report (headline up, core down) saw a chunky block in the TY June contract. After the data, ECB President Draghi’s reiteration of downside risks saw the T-note move in sympathy with the Bund, sending Treasuries to 1-week highs. There was a breather after the European cash close, where book squaring was reported ahead of the 10-year auction. The auction itself was fairly good, stopping through the screens by 1bps, while indirect bidder participation provided some encouragement. The Fed’s latest meeting minutes stuck to the script, though perhaps weren’t as dovish as some might have predicted after the outcome of the March policy meeting. That left major curve spreads mixed at settlement.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The February auction saw the lowest yield at a 30s auction since July 2018, though cover slipped versus the previous month. Analysts at SocGen note that current 30s are trading fair in asset swap from a relative value perspective, but the 5s30s has flattened form multi-month highs at the end of March. The bank also says that the WI is trading beneath all of the 30-year auction stop-out rates since January 2018, which could be a negative factor leading to poor takedown. However, it does say that the current 30 trades rich in repo, which could offset negative factors, and accordingly, it holds a slight negative bias going into the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> As we head into APAC trade, there is a feeling of disappointment that FX moves were so limited on what had been dubbed “Super Wednesday”. The EUR trades up 0.1%, rebounding from losses seen through the ECB press conference as Draghi reiterated downside risks (there wasn’t much new). The DXY is down around 0.1% after the Fed continued to signal a ‘wait and see’ approach. The AUD was higher on short-covering, with the RBA’s Debelle overnight not signalling any easing bias from the central bank. GBP bias was to the upside amid a slightly stronger EUR and weaker GBP; sterling is seen as a buy on dips, as traders price out the no deal downside, and with an extension likely to be be signed-off on by the end of this week, no deal Brexit concerns will be booted into the long grass for another day. EMFX was up, particularly the BRL which gained on the central bank governor making pro business noises, while the economy minister reiterated his drive for pension reform. The ZAR was an outperformer, with wires attributing the strength to an easing of US/China tensions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Conagra Brands (CAG) outperformed following an investor presentation where it provided optimistic guidance. Delta Air Lines (DAL) opened higher on strong earnings and improved revenue guidance. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) nosedived after Evercore downgraded the drug distributor on profit concerns. Disney (DIS) received a tailwind from BMO Capital upgrading and raising the price target for the stock. Chipmakers (AMD, XLNX, INTC) caught a bid amidst a bullish research note on the sector from Cowen, who sees the sector recovering in H2 2019. Automakers, particularly Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM), gained upward momentum following US lawmakers suggesting a bill for increased tax credits for electric vehicles. Kroger (KR) benefitted from a positive mention at Credit Suisse, who see robust profit ahead. Nordstrom (JWN) traded higher after KeyBanc upgraded the apparel retailer. Jet Blue Airways (JBLU) took off on improved March traffic and the teasing of a new transatlantic route. Under Armour (UAA) opened in the green with thanks to an upgrade at Citi.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 5 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-25+. </strong>Decent IP data out of Europe helped the TPLEX find sellers in the premarket, though buyers emerged ahead of the US cash equity open. A mixed CPI report (headline up, core down) saw a chunky block in the TY June contract. After the data, ECB President Draghi’s reiteration of downside risks saw the T-note move in sympathy with the Bund, sending Treasuries to 1-week highs. There was a breather after the European cash close, where book squaring was reported ahead of the 10-year auction. The auction itself was fairly good, stopping through the screens by 1bps, while indirect bidder participation provided some encouragement. The Fed’s latest meeting minutes stuck to the script, though perhaps weren’t as dovish as some might have predicted after the outcome of the March policy meeting. That left major curve spreads mixed at settlement.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The February auction saw the lowest yield at a 30s auction since July 2018, though cover slipped versus the previous month. Analysts at SocGen note that current 30s are trading fair in asset swap from a relative value perspective, but the 5s30s has flattened form multi-month highs at the end of March. The bank also says that the WI is trading beneath all of the 30-year auction stop-out rates since January 2018, which could be a negative factor leading to poor takedown. However, it does say that the current 30 trades rich in repo, which could offset negative factors, and accordingly, it holds a slight negative bias going into the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> As we head into APAC trade, there is a feeling of disappointment that FX moves were so limited on what had been dubbed “Super Wednesday”. The EUR trades up 0.1%, rebounding from losses seen through the ECB press conference as Draghi reiterated downside risks (there wasn’t much new). The DXY is down around 0.1% after the Fed continued to signal a ‘wait and see’ approach. The AUD was higher on short-covering, with the RBA’s Debelle overnight not signalling any easing bias from the central bank. GBP bias was to the upside amid a slightly stronger EUR and weaker GBP; sterling is seen as a buy on dips, as traders price out the no deal downside, and with an extension likely to be be signed-off on by the end of this week, no deal Brexit concerns will be booted into the long grass for another day. EMFX was up, particularly the BRL which gained on the central bank governor making pro business noises, while the economy minister reiterated his drive for pension reform. The ZAR was an outperformer, with wires attributing the strength to an easing of US/China tensions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Compliance of members bound by supply cut deal reported at 155% (exp. 135%). Crude oil output decreased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq, while production increased in Libya, Congo and Nigeria. Venezuela tells OPEC production fell by 472k BPD to 960k BPD, a new long-term low, amid US sanctions and blackouts. Total world oil demand growth in 2018 is estimated at 1.41mln bpd, down 20k bpd from last month’s estimate due to weaker Q4 2018 oil demand data from OECD Asia-Pac. For 2019, oil demand growth is forecast at around 1.21mln bpd vs last month’s 1.24mln bpd forecast due to slower-than-expected economic activity, the EIA also cut its 2019 world oil demand growth. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2018 was revised up by 160k bpd from the previous month’s report. Non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2019 was revised lower by 60k bpd to average 2.18mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* </strong>The oil complex marched forward on Wednesday to re-test YTD highs seen earlier in the week. The US energy inventory data is bound to have muddied the waters for participants, where crude stocks built by a hefty 7mln bbls, above the expected 2.3mln build and superseding the API reported 4.1mln build; however, gasoline stocks moved in the opposite direction, drawing by 7.7mln bbls, greater than the expected 2.3mln draw; the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub also reported stocks drawing by 1.1mln bbls. Price movements were choppy after the release. It's worth keeping in mind that the energy complex is underpinned by supply-side woes emanating from conflicts in Libya, markets are pricing in a potential disruption. El-Sharara oil field is currently producing under capacity (290k vs. full capacity of 300-315k), whilst an explosion occurred near a pipeline that connect El-Feel oilfield (340k) to Zawiya port (scheduled to load 6mln barrels in April). Recent ICE &amp; CME data continues to show long positions expanding in WTI and Brent, with analysts at PVM noting, “a word of caution is in order. The current overhang of speculative length in both crude markers could spark a downward spiral in oil prices. That is if the uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook and OPEC+ production strategy in the second half of the year intensifies. You’ve been warned.” Elsewhere, there were signs that the WTI/Brent arb is weighing on US exports, which declined to 2.35mln BPD in the week (vs 2.7mln last week).</p>",

This may have disappointed the doves, who were looking to the meeting minutes for evidence that the Fed was/may consider cutting rates in the months ahead, as US President Donald Trump and his Fed Board nominee Stephen Moore have called for. The probability of a rate cut was relatively unchanged in wake of the minutes, according to money markets, which imply a 55% chance of a rate cut; some have argued that there is little in the economic landscape that makes a compelling case for rate cuts at present, and as such the pricing could be a reflection of the market’s view that we are at/near the end of the cycle; it could also be a function of threats to the Fed’s independence from the Trump administration, which prefers lower rates. Either way, there is not much in the minutes that significantly shifts the Fed’s narrative, and as such, it will be in wait and see mode in the weeks/potentially months ahead.</p>",

With USD 77.8bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise around USD 200mln in new &nbsp;cash, according to TD Securities.

The latest positioning data indicated dealer holdings &nbsp;rose to a 5-week high in the latest data, to USD 13.89bln.

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Not the biggest G10 loser or mover, but certainly heading into the EU Brexit Summit and FOMC minutes on a weaker footing across the board after a dovish post-ECB policy meeting press conference and Q&amp;A. To recap, headline inflation could slow further in coming months before bottoming in September, and while core measures are muted they are also expected to pick up and continue to converge with the Bank’s price target. However, risks to the economic outlook remain to the downside and the GC recognises the growth slowdown. Hence, TLTRO3 terms are still being assessed, with details to come in following months (June before the 1st targeted repo in September?) and the principle purpose of the April meet was to reassert a readiness to act if required. To that end, there was unanimity about using all instruments, albeit no discussion yet about deployment, including QE and a tiered deposit system. Eur/Usd is hovering just above a new 1.1230 EU session low having topped out ahead of 1.1300 again and retesting, but not breaking through DMA and Fib convergence between 1.1280-84.</p><p><strong>USD/GBP</strong></p><p>Both beneficiaries of the single currency’s demise to an extent, as the <strong>DXY </strong>rebounded from 96.860 lows to a fresh 97.223 peak for the day so far, awaiting FOMC minutes, and after little net reaction to mixed US CPI data that formed another part of the headline acts making up ‘super Wednesday’. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp retreated to and briefly below 0.8600 and Cable peered above 1.3100 at one stage after German Chancellor Merkel made supportive comments about a further A 50 extension and possible a relatively short one more in line with what the UK wants (June 30). However, the reality and EU consensus appears to be 9 or 12 months with a get-out clause if a withdrawal deal can be reached – all eyes now on the emergency Brexit Summit that is die to start at 16.00GMT.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>Out on its own at the front of the major pack after sharing the lead with the <strong>AUD </strong>earlier, as firmer than forecast Norwegian CPI data adds more justification for the Norges Bank to continue its normalisation cycle in the 2nd half of 2019, as signalled. Eur/Nok has extended its decline in response through near term chart support to 9.5770 vs Aud/Usd easing back from 0.7150+ again, though still underpinned in wake of more neutral compared to dovish rhetoric from RBA deputy Governor Debelle.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc has weakened vs the Dollar and Euro even though the single currency was undermined by ECB President Draghi’s comments as noted above. Indeed, Usd/Chf broke out of a tight range around par to 1.0030 and Eur/Chf is close to the upper end of a 1.1284-55 range, with the inclination to suggest official intervention even though there is no hard evidence.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Yen is inching back towards Tuesday’s highs vs the Greenback, but has not breached 111.00 as yet to take another look at 100 DMA resistance or support for the headline pair at 110.90. However, a close below the 21 DMA (111.07) would be technically bearish and the Fed could provide more impetus depending on how dovish or hawkish the aforementioned minutes are perceived to be. The Kiwi has slipped alongside the Aussie to sub-0.6750 against its US counterpart as the Aud/Nzd cross inches close to 1.0600 and the Loonie is pivoting 1.3350 within a firmer/wider 1.3362-18 band.</p>",

Conversely, the single currency looks offered through the base of its prior 1.1254-86 range vs the Usd and is now sub-1.1240, with Eur/Gbp slipping below 0.8600 also in wake of comments from German Chancellor Merkel that inferred a willingness to offer the UK an Article 50 extension, and perhaps a relatively short one. Back to bonds, Gilts have pared more losses from their 127.87 low to retest Liffe peaks (+11 ticks vs -24 ticks), while US Treasuries are also firmer post-mixed CPI data and pre-FOMC minutes.</p>",

Broad-based gains are seen across most sectors, although some underperformance is experienced in healthcare names.&nbsp; JP Morgan (from today’s note) believe that the consumer sector is currently the most oversold sector in Europe whilst autos “may be seeing tentative signs of recovery”. Furthermore, analysts at JPM think that the banking sector continues to look cheap and “continued underperformance means valuations remain extreme historically, notably on dividend yields where the sector now offers a 2% yield pick-up versus the market”.

Meanwhile, RBA deputy Governor Debelle was less dovish than anticipated earlier, with little sign of leaning towards an ease even though he acknowledged conflicting economic trends via strength in jobs vs weakness in consumption and production. Eur/Nok is testing technical support around 9.5900 and Aud/Usd is back up near 0.7150 after retreating to circa 0.7110 at one stage overnight.

Nzd/Usd is back above 0.6750 ahead of US CPI data and the FOMC minutes that together with the ECB meeting and EU Brexit Summit form the key elements of ‘super Wednesday’. On that note, the Pound is underpinned towards the top end of 1.3085-45 trading parameters vs the Greenback after above consensus UK data in the form of GDP, ip, manufacturing and construction output, but will be prone to what evolves from the aforementioned EU gathering and especially the decision whether to grant Britain more breathing space, how much longer and on what terms etc.</p><p><strong>EUR - </strong>Also firmer vs the Dollar as the DXY continues to pivot 97.000, but like the index extremely rangebound just shy of Tuesday’s high and above 1.1250. Eur/Usd is still facing pre-1.1300 big figure resistance as 21 and 31 DMAs lie at 1.1280 and 1.1284 respectively, while expiries are also keeping the headline pair relatively contained (1.3 bn at 1.1245-50 and 2 bn at 1.1260-75).

Weak Japanese machine orders and more dovish BoJ commentary courtesy of Governor Kuroda also in the mix along with decent expiry interest just under 111.00 at 110.90-75 (1.7 bn). Meanwhile, the Franc is back on the parity handle awaiting the impending major events.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Rand has appreciated further against the Buck and is now testing 13.9700 having cleared the psychological 14.0000 mark, but the Lira continues to struggle amidst the post-regional election results tussle with little support from the eagerly-awaited Turkish Economic plan. Indeed, Usd/Try is still elevated, albeit closer to the base of a 5.7200-6700 band.</p><p><strong>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle</strong> said he sees tension between strength in jobs and weakness in output data, while he suggested how tension resolves in approaching months will be important for future path of rates. Debelle also commented that labour market and leading indicators of employment are solid, and although he noted that consumption growth in H2 last year was considerably slower than anticipated, he added that other parts of the economy evolved as expected. Furthermore, he added they can theoretically lower policy rate if needed and does not expect a need to introduce QE, while he still sees decent growth in the economy.

To recap, the ECB policy decisions are not seen as a game-changer or potential market mover, but the post-meeting press conference could prompt further price action and US CPI will feed into the next Fed convene and conference on inflation targeting even if the FOMC minutes are considered somewhat stale. However, the EU emergency summit on Brexit may be the headline-grabber if no further extension is approved as widely anticipated.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI (+0.7%) and Brent (+0.6%)</strong> prices continue climbing despite the wider-than-forecast build in API crude inventories last night (+4.09mln vs. Exp. +2.3mln) where prices saw marginal short-lived downside in the immediate aftermath. Supply woes continue to provide a short-term bullish outlook for the complex with sources stating that Libyan air force undertook airstrikes on military targets for Haftar in the City of Gharyan, in close proximity of the pipeline connecting the El-Feel (340k bpd) oil field to the Zawiya port. Elsewhere, the UAE Energy Minister emerged on the wires, stating that there is a high probability of achieving market balance by the end of this year. It is worth keeping in mind that Russian Energy Minister Novak previously stated that Russia will not extend cuts if the market is expected to be balance in H2 2019. Finally, energy traders will be keeping an eye on the OPEC monthly report which is due to be release at 12:10 BST ahead of the weekly DoE inventory and production data at 15:30 BST.</p><p><strong>Gold (+0.1%)</strong> is essentially flat and trading within a narrow range just above the key USD 1300/oz level, as the yellow metal continues to trade cautiously ahead of today’s ECB decision, FOMC minutes &amp; emergency Brexit summit, whilst copper similarly trades with no firm direction ahead of these key risk events. Separately, sources report that Venezuela removed eight tonnes of gold from its central bank’s vaults, expectations are that Venezuela are to sell the metal in order to generate funds in response to US sanctions.</p><p>US President Trump plans to issue 2 executive orders on Wednesday which aims to ease domestic natural gas transport and avoid lengthy disputes related to cross-border energy projects as seen in the Keystone XL pipeline.

        "content": "<p><strong>NOK/AUD</strong></p><p>The major outperformers and outliers, as Norwegian inflation slowed less than expected in March to underpin H2 Norges Bank rate hike guidance after yesterday’s disappointing GDP data raised a few doubts. Meanwhile, RBA deputy Governor Debelle was less dovish than anticipated earlier, with little sign of leaning towards an ease even though he acknowledged conflicting economic trends via strength in jobs vs weakness in consumption and production. Eur/Nok is testing technical support around 9.5900 and Aud/Usd is back up near 0.7150 after retreating to circa 0.7110 at one stage overnight. Note, however, hefty option expiry interest may hamper the Aussie given 1.5 bn sitting between 0.7145-25 and 1 bn from 0.7100 to 0.7090.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP</strong></p><p>The next best of the G10 bunch, as the Kiwi continues to largely track its Antipodean peer on cross consolidation within a 1.0595-43 range and while Aud/Nzd remains capped ahead of 1.0600. Nzd/Usd is back above 0.6750 ahead of US CPI data and the FOMC minutes that together with the ECB meeting and EU Brexit Summit form the key elements of ‘super Wednesday’. On that note, the Pound is underpinned towards the top end of 1.3085-45 trading parameters vs the Greenback after above consensus UK data in the form of GDP, ip, manufacturing and construction output, but will be prone to what evolves from the aforementioned EU gathering and especially the decision whether to grant Britain more breathing space, how much longer and on what terms etc.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs the Dollar as the <strong>DXY </strong>continues to pivot 97.000, but like the index extremely rangebound just shy of Tuesday’s high and above 1.1250. Eur/Usd is still facing pre-1.1300 big figure resistance as 21 and 31 DMAs lie at 1.1280 and 1.1284 respectively, while expiries are also keeping the headline pair relatively contained (1.3 bn at 1.1245-50 and 2 bn at 1.1260-75). As noted, the ECB meeting looms and a full preview is available via the headline feed and Research Suite section.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd as the Loonie flits between 1.3320-41 and Yen trades just below 111.00 after a fractional/fleeting breach yesterday fell short of the 100 DMA (110.90). Weak Japanese machine orders and more dovish BoJ commentary courtesy of Governor Kuroda also in the mix along with decent expiry interest just under 111.00 at 110.90-75 (1.7 bn). Meanwhile, the Franc is back on the parity handle awaiting the impending major events.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand has appreciated further against the Buck and is now testing 13.9700 having cleared the psychological 14.0000 mark, but the Lira continues to struggle amidst the post-regional election results tussle with little support from the eagerly-awaited Turkish Economic plan. Indeed, Usd/Try is still elevated, albeit closer to the base of a 5.7200-6700 band.</p>",

Back to Gilts, and from a technical perspective there is little in the way of support until 127.78 (last Friday’s base) if the 128.00 level is breached, but the next major moves are likely to be on external impulses via the ECB and US inflation data that are due prior to the EU Summit and FOMC minutes.</p>",

Nevertheless, the 10 year UK benchmark has regrouped after retreating to 128.09 and carved out a minor new intraday peak of 128.22 more recently, while Short Sterling contracts are 0.5-1 tick ahead vs +1.5 ticks at best. Back to the aforementioned data, GDP will be in focus as a relatively new and more up to date growth metric, but in truth the ECB meeting, US CPI, FOMC minutes and last but not least the emergency EU Brexit Summit will grab the main attention.</p>",

As such, the greenback’s main counterparts were subdued with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> contained near the prior day’s lows amid anticipation of a potentially more dovish tone at the ECB and amid escalating EU-US trade tensions, with the pair also constrained by its close proximity to 5, 10 and 20 DMA levels. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> traded sideways ahead of the EU emergency summit where PM May's hopes for a Brexit delay until June 30th is likely to be turned down. Elsewhere, the risk averse sentiment hampered <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> initially softened due to its high-beta properties and with a recent pull back in oil doing no favours for the currency. Furthermore, Westpac also reaffirmed its forecasts for the RBA to cut rates in August, although <strong>AUD</strong> later recovered following comments from RBA Governor Debelle which were less dovish than some had hoped as he hinted of a data dependent approach and was bullish on the labour market.</p><p><strong>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle</strong> said he sees tension between strength in jobs and weakness in output data, while he suggested how tension resolves in approaching months will be important for future path of rates. Debelle also commented that labour market and leading indicators of employment are solid, and although he noted that consumption growth in H2 last year was considerably slower than anticipated, he added that other parts of the economy evolved as expected. Furthermore, he added they can theoretically lower policy rate if needed and does not expect a need to introduce QE, while he still sees decent growth in the economy.

(Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which <strong>oil</strong> consolidated after its recent pull back from multi-month highs, while overnight news flow has been on the bearish side including EIA reducing its global oil demand growth forecasts and a larger than expected build in headline API crude stockpiles. Nonetheless, <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures have just about held on to the USD 64.00/bbl level, while <strong>RBOB</strong> outperformed the energy complex as gasoline inventories showed a drawdown of 7.1mln bbls vs. Exp. 2.0mln bbls draw. Elsewhere, gold prices were flat amid tentativeness ahead of the ECB meeting and FOMC minutes, while <strong>copper</strong> was also lacklustre amid the risk averse tone and with Dalian iron ore futures snapped a 7-day win streak.</p><p><strong>US API Weekly Crude Stocks +4.09M vs. Exp. +2.3M (Prev. +3.0M).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US EIA cut 2019 world oil demand forecast by 50k BPD to 1.4mln BPD YY increase</strong> and cut 2020 world oil demand growth by 10k BPD to 1.45mln BPD increase.

A soft NFIB survey resulted in some buying interest, and Trump’s Twitter trade war salvos also found buyers. The IMF lower growth expectations were also cited as a reason to buy. The Aramco offering of USD 12bln 5-parter didn’t dent the complex too much, despite books reportedly climbing over USD 100bln. The Treasury’s sale of USD 38bln of 3-year notes was ho hum; the auctioned tailed, and the yield was the lowest since Feb 2018. Direct participation rose sharply. Tomorrow the Treasury will auction 10-year notes; the last 10s auction stopped-through the screens, and saw the lowest yield at auction since Jan 2018; cover, meanwhile, was the highest since June, with dealers taking their lowest takedown since March 2017, leaving investment funds with a slightly higher takedown, while foreign participation was relatively unchanged.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly negative amid spillover selling from Wall St where all majors finished lower and the S&amp;P 500 snapped an 8-day win streak as sentiment was pressured by EU-US trade tensions and downward revisions to IMF's global growth forecasts. ASX 200 (+0.2%) was initially subdued with the energy sector pressured by a pullback in oil prices and with heavy losses seen in Crown Resorts after Wynn Resorts abruptly ended takeover talks after the Australian firm prematurely disclosed the details of their discussions, although the index has since pared its losses amid strength in gold miners, tech and the largest weighted financials sector. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) suffers after the recent flows into JPY and disappointing Machine Orders, while Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) conform to the global downbeat risk tone amid further PBoC inaction and as participants await upcoming central bank activity and any fresh developments in the US-China trade saga.</p><p>In FX markets, price action across the major pairs has mostly been uneventful so far as markets await today’s ECB policy meeting and the release of FOMC minutes, although the DXY is marginally firmer and back above the 97.00 level. As such, the greenback’s main counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD contained near the prior day’s lows amid anticipation of a potentially more dovish tone at the ECB and amid escalating EU-US trade tensions, with the pair also constrained by its close proximity to 5, 10 and 20 DMA levels. GBP/USD trades sideways as it bides its time ahead of the EU emergency summit where PM May's hopes to seek a Brexit delay until June 30th is likely to be turned down after EUs Tusk suggested June 30th was not long enough for a Brexit extension and would rather propose a delay of up to a year with a flexible exit. Elsewhere, the risk averse sentiment has hampered USD/JPY and JPY-crosses, as well as AUD due to its high-beta properties and with a recent pull back in oil doing no favours for the currency, while Westpac have also reaffirmed its forecasts for the RBA to cut rates in August.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track gains in T-notes amid the risk averse tone across the region, while the BoJ are also present in the market with today’s Rinban operation focused on the belly.</p>",
