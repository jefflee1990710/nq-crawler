However, other reports stated that EU leaders see a 3-month extension as far more realistic than getting a Brexit deal done and UK government insiders were later said to be cautioning that talk of an imminent deal is “premature” as there are still hurdles to overcome.

Furthermore, Barnier tweeted that talks are difficult but believes an agreement is still possible, while EU diplomats noted that Barnier sees 3 scenarios ahead which include a deal tonight, extension or a 'breakdown'.

In related news, Irish PM Varadkar said DUP will wait for a final deal before making a judgement, while he added initial indicators are that we are making progress and moving in the right direction although at the moment it is unclear if we can have a deal in time for the summit.

China optimism had pared back further as it announced it wanted further tariff reprieve before it made agricultural purchases, singing to the tune that the “Phase 1 deal” was no done deal. As US participants returned from Columbus Day they were greeted with the first day of major US financials (JPM, C, WFC, GS) reporting their Q3 earnings – GS being the noted underperformer with its pinnacle IB unit taking a hit on revenue, with JPM being a stellar exemplar for the sector, beating its EPS and Revenue estimates, with solid growth in its NII/NIM. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) surged after beating earnings estimates whilst guiding FY19 EPS above consensus. JPMorgan (JPM) was a top performer on a beat on top and bottom line, with growth in its NII. Conversely, Goldman Sachs (GS) fell short of expectations on top and bottom line with a 15% decline in IB revenue, seeing it lag the wider sector. Citigroup (C) disappointed on its NII/NIM and posted a 4% decline in its equity unit revenue, although beat on EPS and Revenue. Wells Fargo (WFC) posted a fall in its NIM/NII but caught tailwinds after announcing in its conference call it would be lowering its deposit rates. Charles Schwab (SCHW) caught a bid after beating top and bottom line estimates. Nvidia (NVDA) surged on a PT rise at BofA/ML, citing the chipmaker’s position as poised to benefit from innovation in AI. Consumer Staples (PG, CAG, YUM, CL) traded in the red amid flows out of defensive names. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) beat earnings estimates whilst raising guidance although did exclude litigation expenses from its results. S&amp;P 500 1% at 2996, NASDAQ-100 1.3% at 7943, Dow Jones 0.9% at 27025.</p><p>T-Notes reopened after the long weekend following Columbus Day closures on Monday. The complex sold off throughout the session since the US equity cash open, as it took a leg lower on reports that the UK and EU are close to a draft deal, which saw global debt sell off. At settlement, yields were approximately 1bp higher across the curve, with the long end almost 2bp higher. On the overnight repo operations, NY Fed accepted (USD) 67.6bln out of the 75bln offered, however demand was expected to be high as today was coupon settlement day, additionally, the Fed has now begun purchasing T-Bills at an initial clip of USD 60bln a month, as it announced last week. US T-Notes (Z9) settled 14+ ticks lower at 129.24+.</p>",

Earnings: BAC, ABT, PYPL, NFLX, IBM, ASML</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong><i>Britannia ruled the flows</i> as reports of a Brexit draft deal being near to completion saw moves into risk assets - major equity bourses, yields, activity currencies and crude had a mid-session rally, whilst XAU, DX and JPY declined. China optimism had pared back further as it announced it wanted further tariff reprieve before it made agricultural purchases, singing to the tune that the “Phase 1 deal” was no done deal. As US participants returned from Columbus Day they were greeted with the first day of major US financials (JPM, C, WFC, GS) reporting their Q3 earnings – GS being the noted underperformer with its pinnacle IB unit taking a hit on revenue, with JPM being a stellar exemplar for the sector, beating its EPS and Revenue estimates, with solid growth in its NII/NIM; participants look to BAC earnings on Wednesday. The IMF, unsurprisingly, cut its world demand growth forecast (the 5th time in 2019), which was attributed to the energy complex’s underperformance, where Brexit relief did little to shape investor concerns of the slowing global outlook.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The EU and UK were reported to have been closing in on a draft Brexit deal which would be contingent on DUP support – sparking a risk asset rally – where PM Johnson is said to have compromised on a solution containing a customs border down the Irish Sea. Irish PM Varadkar said the DUP were to wait until the deal proposal had been finalised before passing judgement, although the DUP did say that the deal would need to work for all and ruled out a customs border down the Irish Sea. The success of the deal passing through Parliament, with DUP’s support, will centre around how much the deal resembles the previously rejected Northern Ireland-only backstop; although some had suggested the Brexiteer MPs could be more supportive of a deal this time around due to the fact some hold more central government positions now, and therefore, would like to see their government succeed - although this is just speculation. Negotiations on a draft are said to be continuing into the night, which could go beyond the notional midnight deadline in order for it to be provided to the EU27 tomorrow.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>There was some more walking back of optimism over US/China 'phase one' deal, with sources reporting that China wanted tariffs removed before it committed to further agricultural purchases (which US President Trump announced on Friday). FBN’s Lawrence also cited a Chinese official from the Ministry of Rural Affairs saying China had not agreed to the USD 50bln figure for agricultural purchases, but do plan on the purchase of a “considerable” amount. It is another sign that the 'deal' is merely an in principle de-escalation of tensions, which has seen the 15th October tariffs suspended, along with the vague commitments made by China; the news also comes on the back of Monday's reports that China wanted further talks before it was ready to sign the phase one deal, which was reiterated on Tuesday, which casts some scepticism of the proposed sign-off by Trump and Chinese President Xi at the APEC summit in mid-November.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 1% at 2996, NASDAQ-100 1.3% at 7943, Dow Jones 0.9% at 27025</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 1%, Consumer Staples -0.4%, Energy 0.4%, Financials 1.3%, Health Care 1.8%, Industrials 0.8%, Information Technology 1.1%, Materials 0.7%, Telecommunication Services 1.6%, Utilities -0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) surged after beating earnings estimates whilst guiding FY19 EPS above consensus. JPMorgan (JPM) was a top performer on a beat on top and bottom line, with growth in its NII. Conversely, Goldman Sachs (GS) fell short of expectations on top and bottom line with a 15% decline in IB revenue, seeing it lag the wider sector. Citigroup (C) disappointed on its NII/NIM and posted a 4% decline in its equity unit revenue, although beat on EPS and Revenue. Wells Fargo (WFC) posted a fall in its NIM/NII but caught tailwinds after announcing in its conference call it would be lowering its deposit rates. Charles Schwab (SCHW) caught a bid after beating top and bottom line estimates. Nvidia (NVDA) surged on a PT rise at BofA/ML, citing the chipmaker’s position as poised to benefit from innovation in AI. Consumer Staples (PG, CAG, YUM, CL) traded in the red amid flows out of defensive names. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) beat earnings estimates whilst raising guidance although did exclude litigation expenses from its results.</p><p><strong>* CHINA SEPTEMBER CPI: </strong>Consumer prices rose at a rate of 3.0% Y/Y in September (prev. from 2.8%, consensus 2.9%); PPI fell to -1.2% Y/Y in September (prev. -0.8%). Swine flu contributed again to higher pork prices, resulting in food inflation firming, despite base effects. Pantheon Macroeconomics said overall, inflation looks likely to peak at a little below 4.0% in Q1 next year, even assuming swine flu is brought under control. \"That will worry the authorities, but the policy response will focus more on supply, rather than trying to curb demand. In short, the PBoC will continue to be focused on PPI deflation.\" The PPI signal was in keeping with that of the PMIs, with commodities and processing weighing on the headline, with chemicals and processing of ferrous metals the main drags. \"Headline deflation should soon start to trough, aided by favourable base effects thanks to the drop in commodities prices in Q4 last year,\" Pantheon writes, \"nevertheless, the authorities will remain in easing mode well into next year, and we continue to expect a rate corridor cut of at least 10bp this year.\" Other analysts talking the data -- where CPI is rising on higher pork prices, and PPI is slowing on economic weakness -- is not a particularly encouraging combination.</p><p>* <strong>DEMOCRAT DEBATE:</strong> The fourth democrat debate will take place aftermarket, and polls show Elizabeth Warren is taking the lead, as Joe Biden becomes mired in controversy over his family's dealings with Ukraine while he was Vice President.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed’s Bullard (Voter, Dove, Dissenter) reiterated that trade and other risks remain high and that the rate decisions are taken meeting by meeting. Bullard also commented on recession probability models, saying there are “elevated” (in the minutes several policymakers noted statistical models of a recession in the medium term did increase notably). If there was an ordinary recession, Bullard reiterated that rates could go to zero, forward guidance and QE are also in the toolbox, if needed. On its repo-facility, he hopes for it to launch in 6 months. Fed’s Daly (Non-Voter) spoke to the US economy’s news being largely positive and strong growth in the labour market.</p><p><strong>* IMF: </strong>The IMF cut its global GDP growth by 0.2% in 2019 to 3%, and cut its 2019 global GDP growth to 3.4% from 3.5%. US global growth was also cut in 2019 to 2.4% from 2.6%, and 2020 US GDP growth, however, was increased to 2.1% from 1.9% in July. China’s GDP was cut in 2019 to 6.1% (Prev 6.2%) and cut in 2020 to 5.8% from 6%. The IMF noted that trade war could result in China’s GDP to fall 2% in the near term, and 1% in the long term. For the US, IMF says GDP could fall 0.6% in both short and long term. The Fund also noted that risks are skewed to the downside due to Trade Wars, Brexit, Manufacturing and a falling risk appetite.&nbsp; Trade Wars will result in a cumulative 0.8% fall in global GDP by 2020, adding if both October and December tariffs do not take effect, this decline would be smaller. On the UK, IMF expects a no deal Brexit would reduce UK GDP by 3%. Overall, the IMF does not see a recession but sees risks from having low interest rates for a prolonged period of time.</p><p><strong>WTI (X9) SETTLES USD 0.78 LOWER AT USD 52.81/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.61 LOWER AT USD 58.74/BBL: </strong>Energy benchmarks were lower with extended China trade concerns on top of an IMF global growth downgrade (although unsurprising given its lagging characteristics). OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said OPEC+ compliance stands at 136% - less than the sources report of 200% on Monday – adding that the physical market is relatively tight (although Brent and WTI time calendar spreads tell otherwise recently, displaying falling backwardation as the Saudi Aramco attacks in September fade from the limelight). Not alleviating poor demand concerns was sources suggesting China’s Sinopec is considering a reduction of crude imports in December due to the surge in shipping/freight rates. The API is to report its US energy inventory data on Wednesday evening, ahead of the EIA official release on Thursday, which are both delayed one day due to the US holiday on Monday; current expectations see crude stocks +2.8mln bbls, distillates -2.2mln bbls and gasoline -1.4mln bbls, whilst Genscape sees Cushing stocks +0.72mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 14+ TICKS LOWER AT 129.24+: </strong>T-Notes reopened after the long weekend following Columbus Day closures on Monday. The complex sold off throughout the session since the US equity cash open, as it took a leg lower on reports that the UK and EU are close to a draft deal, which saw global debt sell off. At settlement, yields were approximately 1bp higher across the curve, with the long end almost 2bp higher. On the overnight repo operations, NY Fed accepted (USD) 67.6bln out of the 75bln offered, however demand was expected to be high as today was coupon settlement day, additionally, the Fed has now begun purchasing T-Bills at an initial clip of USD 60bln a month, as it announced last week.</p><p><strong>* CHINA MONEY GROWTH:</strong> M2 money supply rose further to +8.4% Y/Y, beating the expected +8.2% which would have been the same pace as the prior. ING note the rising municipal government issuance of bonds for infrastructure projects, which attributed a CNY 2trln increase and it believes will continue to grow by a further CNY 1trln in Q4. The bank sees debt continuing to rise amid the US-China trade war with infrastructure underpinning that growth.</p><p><strong>* ECB</strong>: The Dutch National Bank's financial stability report warned that prolonged low interest rates constitute one of the major risks to financial stability internationally, noting that financial conditions have been accommodative for several years now, reducing incentives for bringing down debts, and can lead to distorted pricing in financial markets, which could cause asset price bubbles. The DNB also said that persistently low interest rates was weighing heavily on pension funds and life insurers and could incite them to take additional risks.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BoE Governor Carney said the BoE can cut rates close to, but slightly above 0%, if it is required. Vlieghe also noted that he continues to see the UK effective lower bound close to but above zero. Vileghe did note since July the global outlook has deteriorated again, adding a scenario of entrenched Brexit uncertainty is likely to require some stimulus. On future QE, he said there is not much more room for gilt yields to fall. Vlieghe noted slack in the UK economy is probably increasing again, which has a significant impact on the policy outlook, adding rate setters cannot respond to bad news as effectively as good news, which should therefore make them patient on rate hikes.</p><p><strong>* BOJ</strong>: Former BoJ executive director Hideo Hayakawa said the central bank would only loosen policy further if it was in conjunction with the government to tackle the risk of falling price momentum due to an economic deterioration. Hayakawa added that markets were wrong to assume the BoJ will simply cut rates following the Fed's lead. He also argued that the JPY was not critically strong, and therefore the BoJ would not ramp up easing at the 31st October policy meeting, unless the government has plans for an extra stimulus package.</p><p><strong>* RBA MINUTES</strong>: The October meeting minutes had two important features, Westpac says; the first relates the conclusion, where the central bank stated that \"the Board would continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and was prepared to ease monetary policy further, if needed\" -- similar to the conclusion used in September prior to a further rate cut. Westpac says that it was expecting the conclusion to the October minutes to look like the August conclusion, which would have indicated that the Board intended to pause in November as they gathered more information; but that conclusion was not used, noting that the conclusion in October, \"was prepared to ease\", is not as strong as the September conclusion \"would ease\" - It is like the July conclusion, with no strong commitment, and allowing some flexibility. But the bank found it surprising that the Board did not choose to close off the option of another move so soon after October. The second feature was the detailed discussion of the decision to cut rates in October, and a discussion on why lower rates could still be effective. The minutes noted that it was the level of rates rather than the change that was the important determinant, Westpac explains, and that holding back rate cuts in anticipation of a negative shock was not the best policy, instead it was better to take swift action so that the economy would be better placed to absorb a negative shock. There was also a discussion on whether low rates might hit confidence, though the minutes were less conclusive on that question. \"There is no doubt that this discussion can be seen as a justification of the decision that was made in October,\" Westpac writes, \"central banks will always provide robust arguments to support their decisions, however, these arguments seem to go beyond merely justifying the decision in October and laying the foundation for even lower rates.\" The bank notes the lack of discussion on what the ZLB is for rates. Elsewhere, the minutes noted positive developments on exports growth, as well as some aspects of the labour market, though interestingly, the minutes did not confirm the RBA's view that GDP growth in 2020 would be around trend, which Westpac says may imply that the Bank is preparing to lower its GDP forecast for 2020 when it revises them next in November.</p><p><strong>* FX: GBP</strong> rallied following a report that both EU and UK negotiators were closing in on a draft Brexit deal, trading in a range from 1.2604 – 1.2798, seeing support and resistance at the psychological levels, 1.26 and 1.28, respectively. <strong>DXY</strong> traded between 98.201 – 98.650 with technicians keeping an eye on the 98.210 Fib retracement level.&nbsp; The greenback traded slightly lower heading into the Asia session as a strong GBP weighs on the buck, which lost a lot of its ground since the US equity open. <strong>Havens </strong>were lower following hopeful Brexit news, <strong>USDJPY</strong> traded between 108.16 and 108.89, as it followed a similar pattern to US 10-year yields, with rate differentials also likely resulting in outflows of <strong>JPY</strong>. Participants are keeping an eye on the 200dma at 109.06 as their next target if the cross continues to rise. <strong>XAU </strong>spent the morning just beneath the 1500 level, however as markets took a constructive tone, the precious metal sold off throughout the session back to lows beneath 1480.&nbsp; CHF was weaker against the buck, however weaker against EUR and GBP. <strong>CAD </strong>caught a bid on risk appetite pushing USDCAD briefly beneath 1.3200, where it currently flirts around the handle at pixel time. <strong>Antipodes </strong>both on the backfoot as uncertainties around the Phase 1 deal between the US and China are still alive as sources suggested the Chinese requested a full removal of tariffs in order to spend USD 50bln on agricultural goods, AUDUSD at 67.50 heading into Asia, and NZDUSD trading beneath the 0.63 handle, at 0.6280. <strong>TRY </strong>outperformed among EMFX currencies as the sanctions on the region were less severe than some had initially thought, however tensions are still high as a US official said the US is planning to raise sanctions on the nation. <strong>MXN</strong> was flat, <strong>ZAR </strong>weaker and <strong>BRL</strong> underperformed against the buck heading into the US cash close.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>A circa 200 pip range in Cable and big figure+ for Eur/Gbp hardly begins to tell the full story for Sterling on another day full of Brexit headlines comprising positive vibes, media jibes and an array of doubters questioning whether the UK and EU are any closer to reaching a deal or have hardly made more progress. In short, the main man in Brussels, Barnier, compounded rising optimism over a breakthrough, but subsequently doused hopes by stating that UK proposals still fall short of the mark. However, he remained hopeful that an accord could still be forged in time for this week’s Summit and while many believe a further Article 50 extension is more likely (even though the EU may yet call another pre-October 31 meeting on the 28th), the latest word, but no doubt far from final came via sources saying the 2 sides are nearly at the point of a draft agreement, ‘fingers crossed’. The upshot, Cable is now nudging 1.2800 after breezing through the 200 DMA (1.2713) and eclipsing a recent 1.2785 high, while Eur/Gbp has breached Fib support (0.8661) on the way down to almost 0.8625). For the record, UK data in the form of jobs/wages hardly caused a STIR amidst the Brexit barrage, but was weaker than forecast for choice and comments from BoE’s Vlieghe sounded more dovish/downbeat than the MPC’s ongoing gradual and limited tightening chant, but also largely dismissed.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie were undermined to an extent by more uncertainty about the terms and conditions surrounding Phase 1 of the US-China trade deal that emerged via headlines suggesting that Beijing may not be able to meet its pledge to buy up to Usd50 bn US farm goods per annum without lifting counter tariffs. However, the Antipodean Dollars were already on the back foot after RBA minutes reiterating the low rates form an extended period mantra with an easing bias if the OCR needs to be lowered further, but Aud/Usd and Aud/Nzd both held relatively firm around 0.6750 and 1.0750 respectively to leave Nzd/Usd languishing under 0.6300 ahead of NZ Q3 inflation data and not gleaning much direction from mixed GDT auction prices.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>The aforementioned Brexit news has had a profound knock-on effect and widespread impact on risk sentiment of the significantly bullish/upbeat kind, with Usd/Cad breaking lower to retest 1.3200 and Eur/Usd rebounding firmly through 1.1000, in stark contrast to Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy that that surged through recent pinnacles and upside tech/psychological resistance towards parity and 109.00 respectively.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback was mainly hostage to moves elsewhere given a sparse US agenda and nothing new from Fed dissenter and 50 bp rate cut advocate Bullard. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>was subject to volatile trade within 98.201-650 parameters and from a chart perspective a close above or sub-98.210 (Fib retracement level) could be key.</p>",

European equity futures saw upside heading into the cash open amid refuelled Brexit hopes after EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier struck an upbeat tone regarding a potential Brexit deal by the end of the week; although this has been caveated somewhat by EU Diplomatic sources. That said, futures pared back around half of its gains at the open and continued declining with downside exacerbated by source reports that China will struggle to purchase USD 50bln worth of agri goods. Major bourses in the region are ultimately higher, although UK’s FTSE 100 trades flat as exporters bear the brunt of a firmer Sterling, induced by positive comments from various EU lawmakers. Sectors are all in broadly positive territory although the IT sector is somewhat underperforming as Wirecard shares (-18.5%) plumbed the depths after a fresh FT investigation raised prospect of a concerted effort to fake substantial sales and profit at the company. Wirecard has since dismissed the report as “market speculation”. On the flip side, the financial sector fares better as current Brexit optimism spurred gains in domestic banks with Lloyds Banking Group (+3.4%), RBS (+3.4%) Barclays (+2.1%) all at the top of the FTSE 100. Further, the Italian banking sector is propped up by source reports that Italy is mulling reducing the amount of loan losses that banks can deduct from their taxable income next year. Hence the Italian Banking index opened higher by circa. 1% but has since come off of highs. In terms of individual movers, Indivior (+8.0%) shares spiked higher at the open after the Co. boosted its earnings guidance for a second time this year amid a strong performance of its drug used to treat opioid addiction. Meanwhile, Kloeckner &amp; Co.

He added that the deadline to reach an agreement is COB today, but separate reports suggest that another meeting could be convened before the current October 31 deadline if needed, while the UK Government believes that the cut-off for this week is actually Wednesday evening. However, the situation remains highly fluid and uncertain, with Sterling hostage to headlines, breaking news and unfolding developments, as Cable fades just ahead of 1.2700 and Eur/Gbp rebounds from just under 0.8700 towards highs of 0.8750.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD - </strong>Not much respite for the Antipodean Dollars following further reflection and assessment by China and the US about the state of trade relations and significance of Phase 1 even though Beijing and Washington appear to be more convergent on certain elements of the accord in principle.

Elsewhere, more soft Swiss inflation inputs via producer/import prices are keeping the Franc depressed just off parity and around 1.1000 against the single currency, as the DXY continues to flit either side of 98.500.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>More volatility for the Lira, but a recovery of sorts following US sanctions against Turkey that were perhaps not as severe as many were anticipating.

Ahead, more scheduled Central Bank speak to perhaps provide distraction and interludes from all the breaking headlines.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>A downbeat day for WTI and Brent futures </strong>thus far as downward pressure resumed as markets tilted towards risk aversion in early EU trade and as optimism surrounding the US-China mini deal fizzles out. Analysts at ING highlight that the ICE Brent Dec/Jan time-spread has also narrowed to a backwardation of around 0.17/bbl vs. 0.77/bbl at the end of September which suggests the “tightness in the prompt market is easing”. In terms of newsflow, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo noted that the physical oil market is relatively tight now and current demand is the market driver. WTI futures took out 53/bbl to the downside and tests 52.50/bbl ahead of the psychological 52.00/bbl mark whilst its Brent counterpart eyes 58/bbl to the downside. As a reminder the weekly API crude inventories have been postponed by a day due to US observing Columbus Day yesterday; as has the EIA release. Elsewhere, gold has climbed off lows amid a turnaround in sentiment and remains in close proximity to 1500/oz vs. an intraday low of around 1488/oz.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Cable seemed destined for or at least drawn towards a hefty option expiry at the 1.2600 strike before another bout of Brexit deal positivity boosted the Pound across the board, and this time from the EU’s chief negotiator Barnier who remains hopeful that a deal can still be struck in time for Thursday-Friday’s Summit, but warns that latest UK proposals remain inadequate. He added that the deadline to reach an agreement is COB today, but separate reports suggest that another meeting could be convened before the current October 31 deadline if needed, while the UK Government believes that the cut-off for this week is actually Wednesday evening. However, the situation remains highly fluid and uncertain, with Sterling hostage to headlines, breaking news and unfolding developments, as Cable fades just ahead of 1.2700 and Eur/Gbp rebounds from just under 0.8700 towards highs of 0.8750.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Not much respite for the Antipodean Dollars following further reflection and assessment by China and the US about the state of trade relations and significance of Phase 1 even though Beijing and Washington appear to be more convergent on certain elements of the accord in principle. Indeed, the Kiwi is still capped ahead of 0.6300 awaiting NZ Q3 CPI after the latest GDT auction, while the Aussie remains some way below 0.6800 in wake of RBA minutes underlining guidance for keeping rates low or easing further if required, and with a decent 625 mn expiry at the big figure.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>Comparatively contained trade vs the Greenback again, as the Yen meanders between 108.23-45 and just shy of decent expiry interest residing at 108.00-20 (1.5 bn), while the Loonie is striving to limit losses beyond 1.3240 amidst a deeper retreat in oil prices and Euro remains top heavy into 1.1050, and perhaps also rooted by expiries given 1 bn rolling off just above 1.1000 (1 bn from 1.1015-20). Elsewhere, more soft Swiss inflation inputs via producer/import prices are keeping the Franc depressed just off parity and around 1.1000 against the single currency, as the <strong>DXY </strong>continues to flit either side of 98.500.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>More volatility for the Lira, but a recovery of sorts following US sanctions against Turkey that were perhaps not as severe as many were anticipating. Nevertheless, Usd/Try remains elevated within a 5.8605-9320 range and underpinned on the back of a rise in unemployment plus a big swing in the budget balance from small surplus to onerous deficit.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was steady despite the outperformance of Japanese risk sentiment, while antipodeans conformed to the uninspiring picture after the RBA minutes provided little in terms of new information in which it reiterated the board is prepared to ease policy further if needed and that it is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low rates would be required.</p><p>RBA Minutes from October 1st meeting stated the board judged case for easing at October meeting outweighed arguments against a move and that it is prepared to ease policy further if needed.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were little changed due to the uneventful greenback with the precious metal biding its time just south of the USD 1500/oz level and <strong>copper</strong> mirrored the indecisive risk tone due to the tempered trade hopes which had subsequently pressured Chinese commodity prices from the open.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS US President Trump is to authorise sanctions against current and former Turkish officials, while the US will immediately stop negotiations with Turkey on a USD 100bln trade deal and are to reintroduce steel tariffs back at 50%.</strong> (Newswires) US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US sanctioned Turkey’s Ministers of Interior, Defence and Energy but added the US will issue license to continue to let Turkey buy fuel and will remove sanctions based on Turkey's actions. (Newswires)</p><p>US VP Pence said President Trump spoke with Turkish President Erdogan and asked him to halt incursion into Syria, while Erdogan gave assurance that Turkey will not attack the city of Kobani.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Conditions were thin in the North American trade, with many players away on US Columbus Day and Canadian Thanksgiving. However, the positivity seen on Friday has been faded, as desks re-evaluate the optimism over US/China trade talks and challenges around the course for Brexit deal emerge. With that said, the usually hawkish Global Times editor has tried to explain away some of the differences in language used by the US/China over the weekend, while many Brexit watchers were never truly convinced that UK PM Johnson's plan would be able to fly in its current form. And then on the margin, geopolitics around Turkey/Syria have been at the forefront of traders’ minds which left the equity complex which largely flat, while T-Note futures finished up (settling 11 ticks higher at 130-07, though off the pre-market highs seen after reports that China wanted more discussions before signing the phase one trade deal).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, it also noted that the low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector should all support growth.</p><p>The initial reaction in AUD/USD to the rate announcement was to the upside as the statement added that a gentle turning point appears to have been reached, although this was eventually pared as the central bank also noted it is reasonable to expect an extended period of low interest rates will be required, that it has room to further ease if needed and that risks are titled to the downside.</p>",
