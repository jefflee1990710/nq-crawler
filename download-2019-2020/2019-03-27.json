(Newswires)</p><p>UK PM May reportedly told the 1922 committee members that she will hand over leadership once Brexit is delivered according to Huffington Post. Furthermore, other reports suggested that she will not stay for the next stage of negotiations and others noted that will step down in the summer. (Huffington Post/Daily Mirror/The Guardian/Twitter)</p><p>DUP said it will not support the government on the Brexit deal if it tables a 3rd meaningful vote and that the party cannot agree to anything which threatens the union, while DUP's Dodds also said we will vote against PM May's deal and will not abstain when it comes to the union. (Newswires)</p><p>UK ERG source suggested 40 lawmakers have switched to back PM May's deal and 40 are undecided, according to The Times' Sam Coates. Separately, ERG head Jacob Rees-Mogg earlier said he will back PM May’s deal if the DUP abstain and Brexiteer Boris Johnson is also reportedly to back PM May's deal which was in line with hints he made yesterday. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>Brexit Minister Barclay said that they will table a motion for the Parliament to sit on Friday, while Downing Street sources also suggested a Meaningful Vote 3 is 'pencilled in' for Friday, according to ITV's Brand.

Centene (CNC) nosedived on the announcement it would be acquiring WellCare Health (WCG), which consequentially surged; competitor CVS Health (CVS) dipped lower. Lennar (LEN) missed on top and bottom line estimates, but gave constructive guidance, leading it open higher; competitors PulteGroup (PHM) and D.R. Horton (DHI) also outperformed. Paychex (PAYX) drifted lower on a mixed outlook, despite beating earnings estimates. Ralph Lauren (RL) and Papa John’s (PZZA) both benefitted from upgrades at Wells Fargo and Stifel respectively. Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE) traded higher after an upgrade at Morgan Stanley. DowDuPont (DWDP) sold off on news that it was to be replaced by Dow Inc. (DOW), it’s spin-off, in the DJIA. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) erased losses after a New Jersey jury cleared it of claims of its talcum powder causing cancer. A dampening of risk sentiment saw high beta stocks push lower, particularly chipmakers such as Western Digital (WDC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texan Instruments (TXN). SPX -0.46% at 2805, NDX -0.58% at 7308, DJI -0.13% at 25626.</p><p>Most of the early action overnight/Europe trade was focussed on the short-end, underpinned by comments from Fed governor nominee Moore, who called on the Fed to immediately cut rates by 50bps. This saw the curve bull steepen. There was focus on a German 10yr auction, which sold at negative yields for the first time since 2016.The long-end of the yield curve continued to test new lows (lowest in over a year), with participants continuing to note that the 30-year bucket is the only part of the curve with its head above the effective fed funds rate. On that note, the 3m/10y inversion deepened to over 10bps on Wednesday trade; the market has been rationalising these moves with more circumspection, though concerns about the growth outlook are clearly evident. Next week’s survey data and jobs data may provide the next major catalyst for the narrative to be tweaked. Meanwhile, the belly of the curve saw decent action; in early trade a block sale of the FVM9 in 5k was followed by a large sale (15k); later in the session, some desks had reported real money was profit taking in the belly. US T-note futures (M9) settled 9 ticks higher at 124-22.</p>",

Note – this would therefore commit the UK to the free movement of people. There has been caution from both EFTA &amp; EU about upsetting EEA, but general model might be viable. Paragraph 2, however, making this binding likely will not work due to this being a negotiation. Note: Labour party are encouraging support for this amendment, but it is not being whipped as it is not technically party policy - though implication is on Corbyn to support this. &nbsp;(188 For vs. 283 Against)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· (H) EEA/EFTA; Tabled by George Eustace [Con] - Should seek to remain in the EEA and rejoin the EFTA, whilst remaining outside of a customs union with the UK. Similar to D, except that UK can stay in EEA, so likely to see some dispute from the EU. &nbsp;(65 For vs. 377 Against)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· (J) Customs Union; Tabled by Ken Clarke [Con] - Compels the gov’t to negotiate for a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU. Seen as a softer Brexit, although PM May is against this scenario as it defies the 2017 Tory manifesto. Compatible with EU options. Note: Labour will whip to support this amendment. &nbsp;(234 For vs. 272 Against)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· (K) Labour; Tabled by Jeremy Corbyn [Lab] - Motion proposes their plan for a close economic relationship with the EU, which features a comprehensive customs union and a close alignment with the single market. Labour's alternative plan\" includes customs union (OK), 'close alignment' with single market (UK's choice) with 'shared institutions' (unlikely if not fully inside single market) and participation in various EU programmes (probably OK). Note: Labour will whip to support this amendment. &nbsp;(237 For vs. 307 Against)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· (L) Revoke Article 50; Tabled by Joanna Cherry [SNP] - If the Gov’t has not passed a deal it would be required to stage a no-deal vote before 12th April scheduled departure, then in the scenario that MP’s do not authorise a no-deal PM May would be required to revoke Article 50. Fully within UK power as long as revocation is unconditional &nbsp;(184 For vs. 293 Against)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· (M) Second ‘Confirmatory’ referendum; Tabled by Margaret Beckett [Lab] - Some Remainers have argued that the public now has a better understanding of Brexit and therefore should be asked again. Requires a long extension, which EU is likely to grant on these grounds. Note: Labour will whip to support this amendment. &nbsp;(268 For vs. 295 Against)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>· (O) Contingent Preferential Arrangements; Tabled by Marcus Fysh [Con] - Gov’t to attempt agree upon preferential trade agreements with the EU, in the scenario that a WA in not implemented.

However, the data was driven by a larger than expected fall in imports, which doesn't augur too well. \"Nonetheless, with imports likely to have been flat or fallen slightly in the first quarter, net trade is on track to be a positive for first quarter GDP growth,\" Capital Economics said, and the consultancy now expects growth to come in around 2.0% annualised, up from our previous estimate of 1.5%. Other trackers were more moderate; Atlanta Fed's GDPnow model was tracking 1.5% vs 1.3% previously.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB staff are reportedly working on models for a tiered deposit rate, according to sources, and staff are working on options to return some -- but not all -- of the cash it collects from a charge on excess liquidity, the sources said. The report followed comments from the ECB's Draghi earlier in the session, where he said that accommodative monpol has supported bank profitability in recent years, and the central bank's conventional and unconventional measures have improved the quality of credit. Draghi made the case that the ECB's measures have also increased demand for loans, and more than offset the negative impact of compressed margins. Draghi also said that the central bank is now seeing a more persistent deterioration of external demand, and that current data suggests that there are some signs that external demand may be effecting investment via manufacturing value chains within the Euro Area. The central bank chief also said that the domestic economy has remained relatively resilient, repeated that risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, and repeated that the ECB remains confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim has been delayed rather than derailed. Also at the ECB watcher's conference, outgoing chief economist Praet said that in any case, the central bank stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure sustained inflation convergence towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Praet said all our instruments remain available following the return to rate forward guidance as our main policy tool, and TLTROs are flexible tools with parameters that could be recalibrated. ECB's VP de Guindos stated that the Euro area is not immune to spill-overs from other regions, in particular to shocks emanating from the US, adding that low economic growth raises concerns about sovereign debt sustainability. Meanwhile, ECB's Mersch said the ECB continue to assess the impact of their measures, and of negative interest rates in particular, on areas such as bank profitability, and to consider whether ECB mix of policy measures remains suitable and proportionate.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK PM May reportedly told 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs that she would step down as PM once Brexit is delivered. The suggestion, sources said, was that another leader would be take over negotiations on trade with the EU, as a result; this would imply that May steps down before 22 May (with a new leader in place by mid-July). However, her pledge seems to have been caveated on her deal passing, and ahead of indicative votes on various Brexit options (results to be announced after 2000 GMT on Wednesday), the government has been manoeuvring to place MV3 on the docket for Friday. At this stage, it is unclear whether May has garnered enough support for her deal with this pledge, however, the initial indications are that at least some Brexiteers may have been persuaded by her gambit (Times reported that at least 40 Tory Brexiteers would back May, 40 were undecided). It is also unclear what May's plans would be in the event that her deal did not secure the requisite support.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 0.53 LOWER AT USD 59.41; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.14 LOWER AT USD 67.83. </strong>Oil prices pared back Tuesday’s rally, in particular WTI, as the market rolled on the release of last night’s surprise build API release, which was confirmed by today’s official DOE data. The DOEs showed crude stocks building 2.8mln bbls, a reversal from the near 10mln bbl draw last week and a surprise from the expected 1.2mln bbl draw, but confirming the API’s reported 1.9mln build; Cushing also saw a c. 500k bbl build. On a side note, the products painted a more bullish picture with gasoline and distillates both drawing more than expected, perhaps limiting some of the down side risk. The US still continues to produce at a record high of 12.1mln BPD for the week. Elsewhere, it was reported that Russia’s production level was at 11.3mln BPD up to now for the month of March, only marginally lower than February’s 11.34 level and not at its quota of 11.19; Iraq also resumed its southern oil exports following a stoppage due to weather conditions, adding further pressure to the energy complex. Libya’s NOC said that it could produce up to 1.4mln BPD if the country found political stability.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.46% at 2805, NDX -0.58% at 7308, DJI -0.13% at 25626. SECTORS: Energy -0.70%, Materials -0.09%, Industrials +0.10%, Cons Discretionary -0.26%, Cons Staples -0.40%, Healthcare -0.81%, Financials -0.44%, Tech -0.55%, Telecoms -0.54%, Utilities -0.67%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) found some relief today, supported by positive mentions at Piper Jaffray as well as being exonerated from one of its Qualcomm (QCOM) lawsuits; Qualcomm (QCOM) also faced headwinds from a Neutral initiation at JPM, citing downside risk from Apple litigation. Centene (CNC) nosedived on the announcement it would be acquiring WellCare Health (WCG), which consequentially surged; competitor CVS Health (CVS) dipped lower. Lennar (LEN) missed on top and bottom line estimates, but gave constructive guidance, leading&nbsp; it open higher; competitors PulteGroup (PHM) and D.R. Horton (DHI) also outperformed. Paychex (PAYX) drifted lower on a mixed outlook, despite beating earnings estimates. Ralph Lauren (RL) and Papa John’s (PZZA) both benefitted from upgrades at Wells Fargo and Stifel respectively. Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE) traded higher after an upgrade at Morgan Stanley. DowDuPont (DWDP) sold off on news that it was to be replaced by Dow Inc. (DOW), it’s spin-off, in the DJIA. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) erased losses after a New Jersey jury cleared it of claims of its talcum powder causing cancer. A dampening of risk sentiment saw high beta stocks push lower, particularly chipmakers such as Western Digital (WDC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texan Instruments (TXN).</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 124-22. </strong>Most of the early action overnight/Europe trade was focussed on the short-end, underpinned by comments from Fed governor nominee Moore, who called on the Fed to immediately cut rates by 50bps. This saw the curve bull steepen. There was focus on a German 10yr auction, which sold at negative yields for the first time since 2016.The long-end of the yield curve continued to test new lows (lowest in over a year), with participants continuing to note that the 30-year bucket is the only part of the curve with its head above the effective fed funds rate. On that note, the 3m/10y inversion deepened to over 10bps on Wednesday trade; the market has been rationalising these moves with more circumspection, though concerns about the growth outlook are clearly evident. Next week’s survey data and jobs data may provide the next major catalyst for the narrative to be tweaked. Meanwhile, the belly of the curve saw decent action; in early trade a block sale of the FVM9 in 5k was followed by a large sale (15k); later in the session, some desks had reported real money was profit taking in the belly.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The last 7s auction was solid, stopping through the WI by 0.8bps, while cover was the highest since August (three of the last four have stopped through, now). Barclays notes that the investor and bidder takedowns for February were similar to January, “namely, domestic and foreign investor takedown was over 60% and 20% respectively.” The bank also notes that on-the-run 7s were trading cheap vs older 7s in repo vs other auction cycles, and this suggests that there is room for the auction to set-up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> EUR marginally lower, USD marginally higher (yields generally lower, stocks down; hints of ECB easing also cited; weak China data didn't help). Analysts have observed that the trade-weighted buck remains firm, despite last week's Fed dovishness, with the prevailing wisdom that the grind higher is on the back of concerns about global growth, as well as the dovish pivot of other global central banks. On that note, the NZD was slammed after the RBNZ suggested its next rate move could be a rate cut; that also put some pressure on AUD, with expectations that we could see something similar from the RBA next week. GBP is clinging on to gains above 1.32 with a series of indicative votes on the slate for this evening, while May's MV3 (potentially Friday) is also seen garnering Brexiteer support. EMFX succumbed to USD strength, while commodity FX gained no support from the crude complex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This saw the curve bull steepen. There was focus on a German 10yr auction, which sold at negative yields for the first time since 2016.The long-end of the yield curve continued to test new lows (lowest in over a year), with participants continuing to note that the 30-year bucket is the only part of the curve with its head above the effective fed funds rate. On that note, the 3m/10y inversion deepened to over 10bps on Wednesday trade; the market has been rationalizing these moves with more circumspection, though concerns about the growth outlook are clearly evident. Next week’s survey data and jobs data may provide the next major catalyst for the narrative to be tweaked. Meanwhile, the belly of the curve saw decent action; in early trade a block sale of the FVM9 in 5k was followed by a large sale (15k); later in the session, some desks had reported real money was profit taking in the belly.</p>",

On a side note, the products painted a more bullish picture with gasoline and distillates both drawing more than expected, perhaps limiting some of the down side risk. The US still continues to produce at a record high of 12.1mln BPD for the week. Elsewhere, it was reported that Russia’s production level was at 11.3mln BPD up to now for the month of March, only marginally lower than February’s 11.34 level and not at its quota of 11.19; Iraq also resumed its southern oil exports following a stoppage due to weather conditions, adding further pressure to the energy complex.

USD 71.5bln matured at the month-end settlement, implying the Treasury will raise a net USD 59.5bln in new supply. USD 22.4bln of Fed holdings mature at the month-end settlement, and the Fed will add-on USD 7.9bln to 2yr, USD 8.1bln to 5yr, and USD 6.3bln to 7yr. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>* FOMC: Last week's FOMC meeting was more dovish than anticipated, with the Fed announcing that it will slow the balance sheet run-off in May, ending in September, and reducing caps on monthly redemptions to USD 15bln, from USD 30bln; it will also be reinvesting MBS coupons back into Treasuries. \"With runoff ending in September, we think that Treasury will likely cut coupon auction sizes later this year (potentially focused in the 2-3y sector). Runoff ending in September will decrease Treasury issuance by about $100bn compared with runoff continuing throughout the year,\" TD Securities says. \"The Fed will have to reinvest MBS paydowns in the open market starting in October. Starting in Q4 2020, we look for the Fed to purchase additional Treasuries in the open market to offset the growth in currency in circulation.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>* 5-YEAR PREVIEW: The February 5-year auction was digested well, as was the January auction, despite the richening of the curve in the run-up. \"Auction performance in 2019 has been strong, with both auctions stopping through,\" Barclays noted, \"previous to this, July 2018 was the last time the 5y auction stopped through.\" The bank also points out that final demand (that of direct and indirect participation) at 5-year auctions are near post-crisis highs with an allocation of 80% as primary dealer down has fallen. In terms of valuation, the bank observes that on-the-run 5-year notes are trading fair vs older 5s in spot and in forward</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/43fa6238-cf95-4001-bb2c-b1469f56321c.jpg\"></figure>",

However, chartists are still looking for a close above 96.956 Fib resistance and the Greenback remains partly at the whim of G10 counterparts and broader risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie have extended already heavy overnight loss vs their US peer to 0.6790 and 0.7075 respectively as waning risk appetite compounded the pressure induced by a more dovish than anticipated RBNZ (OCR now more likely to be lowered vs an even chance of a cut or hike previously) and weak Chinese industrial profits (worst performance in nearly a decade).</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The other non-US Dollar has also deteriorated over the course of the session as Canada’s trade balance widened more than forecast in January and official DoE crude inventories rose in line with API stocks and also against consensus for a draw to the detriment of crude prices. Usd/Cad hit highs of circa 1.3430 in response vs 1.3375 or so at one stage.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>Also a hefty loser on a mixture of risk-off trade and data disappointment as Norway’s Labour Force Survey revealed a surprise rise in January’s unemployment rate, with Eur/Nok up to 9.7300 from around 9.6250 at the low.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The major outlier and outperformer due to its greater appeal compared to the Buck in times of stress and safe-haven positioning, with Usd/Jpy drifting down towards 110.25 vs 110.70, while Yen crosses in general are back-pedalling from recent highs, ie Eur/Jpy retesting 124.00 and key technical support just below the big figure.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound has remained relatively stable through all the daily Brexit bluster, barring a brief period of selling that pulled Cable back down through 1.3200 to revisit Tuesday’s low as Eur/Gbp climbed to circa 0.8550. In short, the procedural vote to table amendments for IVs has now been passed and the Speaker has chosen 8 of the 16 for debate and voting later, while the DUP is expected to make an official statement after more talks with the Government about the Withdrawal Agreement. On that note, a 3rd MV could come as early as tomorrow, or more likely on Friday. Cable is now just above 1.3200 and Eur/Gbp a little over 0.8500 awaiting unfolding Parliament developments – see our headline for more detailed latest analysis.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>A blanket sea of red for regional currencies as the Real, and Lira slump around 2% or more vs the Usd in line with the overall risk averse tone and specific negative issues like Brazilian pension reform and a Turkish liquidity squeeze that saw swaps leap to over 1330% at one point. Usd/Brl and Usd/Try now just shy of 3.9500 and 5.4250, but up to 3.9600 and 5.4645 at their peaks.</p>",

The result of any such indicative votes would not be binding on the government as it goes against the Tory manifesto. There is no official list of options, although one has been generated by the Commons select committee for exiting the EU.</p><p><strong>*INDICATIVE VOTE PROCESS</strong>: .</p><p><strong>BALLOT VOTE: </strong>Today's indicative vote is said to include a ballot paper where all options are voted on at once (Yes/No vote). House Speaker will decide which options are on the ballot and the results will likely be declared at night.</p><p><strong>*SELECTED OPTIONS FOR THE INDICATIVE VOTE</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;<strong>(B) No Deal; Tabled by John Baron [Con] </strong>- The legal default if negotiations do not achieve agreement on a deal, proposes leaving the EU without a deal on 12th April.<i> No technical issue for the EU.</i></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;(D) Common Market 2.0; Tabled by Nick Boles [Con] </strong>- Regarded as the leading ‘soft’ Brexit plan; with UK membership of the European Free Trade Association &amp; European Economic Area. Note – this would therefore commit the UK to the free movement of people. <i>There has been caution from both EFTA &amp; EU about upsetting EEA, but general model might be viable. Paragraph 2, however, making this binding likely will not work due to this being a negotiation</i>. Note: Labour party are encouraging support for this amendment, but it is not being whipped as it is not technically party policy - though implication is on Corbyn to support this.</p><p><strong>·&nbsp;(H) EEA/EFTA; Tabled by George Eustace</strong> <strong>[Con]</strong> - Should seek to remain in the EEA and rejoin the EFTA, whilst remaining outside of a customs union with the UK. Similar to D, except that UK can stay in EEA, so<i> likely to see some dispute from the EU.</i></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;(J)</strong> <strong>Customs Union; Tabled by Ken Clarke [Con] </strong>- Compels the gov’t to negotiate for a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU.

No technical issue for the EU.</p><p>·&nbsp;(D) Common Market 2.0; Tabled by Nick Boles [Con] - Regarded as the leading ‘soft’ Brexit plan; with UK membership of the European Free Trade Association &amp; European Economic Area. Note – this would therefore commit the UK to the free movement of people. There has been caution from both EFTA &amp; EU about upsetting EEA, but general model might be viable. Paragraph 2, however, making this binding likely will not work due to this being a negotiation. Note: Labour party are encouraging support for this amendment, but it is not being whipped as it is not technically party policy - though implication is on Corbyn to support this.</p><p>·&nbsp;(H) EEA/EFTA; Tabled by George Eustace [Con] - Should seek to remain in the EEA and rejoin the EFTA, whilst remaining outside of a customs union with the UK. Similar to D, except that UK can stay in EEA, so likely to see some dispute from the EU.</p><p>·&nbsp;(J) Customs Union; Tabled by Ken Clarke [Con] - Compels the gov’t to negotiate for a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU.

Bunds retreated a bit deeper below 166.00 before regrouping and Gilts went several steps further to post a new 129.07 Liffe low, while US Treasuries have whittled gains to single digits with the curve almost back to steady vs flatter or more pronounced inversion earlier. Elsewhere, the Usd is firmer on balance, and especially vs the Cad after a wider than forecast Canadian trade deficit, but the Gbp is bucking the general trend into tonight’s IVs.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars are back on the rack, with the Kiwi sharply underperforming in wake of OCR cut revelations from the RBNZ overnight after an unexpected switch from neutral to easing mode amidst a bleaker assessment of the economy and heightened risks of a more pronounced downturn. Nzd/Usd slumped over a big figure in response and is clinging to 0.6800, as the Aud/Nzd cross extended recovery gains well beyond 1.0300 to circa 1.0450 before consolidating, and with Aud/Usd retreating to sub-0.7100 at one stage on the back of worrying Chinese data in the form of industrial profits (-14% y/y and weakest in almost 10 years).</p><p><strong>NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another G10 laggard following a rise in Norwegian unemployment vs the consensus for an unchanged jobless rate, with Eur/Nok back up above 9.6500 vs a more stable <strong>SEK </strong>around 10.4200 vs the single currency amidst mixed Swedish sentiment indicators, a wider trade surplus and 2019 GDP forecast upgrade via the NIER.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Relative outperformers and all firmer vs the Greenback as the Jpy benefits from renewed safe-haven positioning within a 110.70-30 range and moves further away from decent option expiry interest sitting between 110.70-75 (1.4 bn). Similarly, the Franc is benefiting from another downturn in risk sentiment and revisits recent highs around 0.9900 and through 1.1200 against the Euro, which looked vulnerable independently when testing Tuesday’s lows vs the Buck around 1.1250 before some timely support from ECB President Draghi who contended that a more sustained downturn in external demand and other factors have merely hampered rather than scuppered Eurozone inflation convergence towards target. Eur/Usd has subsequently rebounded relatively firmly to challenge Fib resistance at 1.1280, but could be capped ahead of 1.1300 given hefty expiries spanning 1.1255-65 (1.5 bn).</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>The Pound remains rangebound around 1.3200 vs the Usd awaiting the next chapter of Brexit and up to 16 amendments to be voted on in Parliament after the Letwin approval – see our headline feed for a situation update and detailed analysis of all the motions tabled that could be selected by the HoC Speaker later today. Note, Cable survived an early downside attempt, and like Eur/Usd held around yesterday’s base, but is likely to face some offers around 1.3250 by the same token. Elsewhere, the Loonie is losing some support from oil prices with Usd/Cad towards the top of a 1.3407-1.3376 band ahead of trade data from Canada and the US.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index has come up against some psychological and chart resistance just shy of 97.000, with a Fib at 96.956 only marginally and briefly breached. Moreover, the broad Dollar has conceded ground to the aforementioned comeback in rival currencies.</p>",

Latest dovish impulses and positive momentum have been reignited to an extent by another global Central Bank shifting into easing mode (RBNZ), while Eurozone debt is also primed for a raft of ECB speakers that may reinforce recent the recent roll-back of rate guidance and introduction of TLTRO3. Technically, 166.12 forms the next line of resistance for Bunds ahead of 166.28 and then 166.48, while supply could also cause some congestion or indigestion with a Eur3 bn 2029 tap offered at a negative yield vs 0.25% coupon.</p>",

Elsewhere, the indecisive risk tone weighed on <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses but with the pressure on <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> alleviated by a firmer greenback and support around 110.50 where several key DMA levels are closely located, while antipodeans underperformed with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> heavily weighed after the dovish surprise by the RBNZ which kept rates unchanged as expected but deviated from its past outlook for rates to move in either direction and now sees it more likely for the next OCR move to be a cut. This spurred an adjustment to forecasts in which ANZ Bank now sees a cut in November this year with the risk of a sooner reduction, while money markets were seen to price OCR cuts in November this year and in June next year. As such, <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> fell below the 0.6900 handle and later breached 0.6800 to the downside, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> suffered in sympathy to test support levels around 0.7100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBNZ kept the OCR on hold at 1.75% as expected and stated it is more likely the direction of next OCR move is down</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, the RBNZ said the balance to inflation risk have shifted to the downside and global economic outlook has continued to weaken, although it added that low rates as well as increased government spending and investment is to support growth this year.

Furthermore, Russian Energy Minister Novak also affirmed they are in the process of achieving planned oil output cuts, while a surprise build in headline API crude inventories did little to dent oil’s recent performance which is on track for its best 3-month start to the year since 2002.

Uninspiring US data helped contribute some positive ticks. The 2yr note auction was decent, stopping through the screens by 1.2bps; cover was above recent averages. The decent auction helped stabilise the TPLEX, but subdued trade resumed into the close.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mixed as the region somewhat failed to maintain the broad positive momentum from US where all majors finished in the green with the gains led by outperformance in energy and financials. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were both negative throughout the day although the Australian benchmark just about recovered at the close, while Tokyo stocks underperformed amid currency effects and mass ex-dividend day involving over 1000 stocks including blue-chips Mitsubishi UFJ, SoftBank and Sony. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) were initially indecisive amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction and as participants mulled over another deluge of earnings, as well as discouraging data in which February YTD Industrial Profits slumped by the most in nearly a decade. However, sentiment in China then improved with energy names boosted by the recent advances in oil, while there was also reports that China and Italy signed an MOU to make Italy the first western European country to join the Belt &amp; Road initiative. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly higher as they tracked the marginal gains seen in T-notes and as the subdued risk appetite in Japan kept prices afloat.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as the region fails to maintain the positive momentum from US where all majors finished in the green with the broad sector gains led by outperformance in energy and financials. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are negative with weakness seen in nearly all of Australia’s sectors aide from tech, while Tokyo stocks underperform amid currency effects and mass ex-dividend day involving over 1000 stocks including blue-chips Mitsubishi UFJ, SoftBank and Sony. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are indecisive amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction and as participants mull over another deluge of earnings, while data was also discouraging in which February YTD Industrial Profits slumped by 14.3% Y/Y.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer overnight and edges its way back up towards the 97.00 level as its major counterparts trade subdued, with EUR/USD extending on the recent data-driven weakness before finding some near-term support at 1.1250. GBP/USD is also softer overnight and has slipped below the 1.3200 handle with the pair ranging ahead of today’s indicative votes in Parliament where MPs are said to have tabled at least 16 proposals on alternative Brexit options. Elsewhere, the indecisive risk tone has weighed on JPY-crosses but with the pressure on USD/JPY alleviated by a firmer greenback and support around 110.50 where several key DMA levels are located, while antipodeans underperform with NZD/USD slumping after the dovish surprise by the RBNZ which kept rates unchanged as expected but deviated from its past outlook for rates to move in either direction and now sees it is more likely the direction of the next OCR move to be a cut.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher with prices supported following the mild gains seen in T-notes and subdued risk appetite in Japan.&nbsp;</p>",
