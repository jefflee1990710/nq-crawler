(MSNBC/AFP)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>The week has started off with a tone of caution, with many markets off for Easter Holidays. Desks noted profit-taking after a solid week for US stocks (and ahead of what is likely to be a grim earnings season), while the OPEC+ deal is not judged sufficient to balance the market by some analysts; additionally, in Europe, there was a little disappointment with the Eurogroup's latest measures to finance the virus response ('coronabonds' not included). When US participants arrived, however, the tone began shifting, with equity futures paring back losses and the curve bear-steepening after the cash open. However, that proved short-lived, and the S&amp;P 500 was enduring losses around 2% at one point, helping gold to rally to highs not seen since 2012, although the Treasury complex did not rally, with the curve bear-steepening. The focus will now be on earnings from JPM and WFC on Tuesday, as well as the much-touted meeting of the Texas Railroad Commission to discuss crude production in the state. On the virus front, there was another set of positive comments from NY Governor Cuomo, who suggested that the ‘worst is over’; some now think much of the positive virus news is priced in, with any further catalysts likely to depend on the COVID-19 showing a descending trend in both new cases and deaths, with positive developments on the vaccine front; additionally, a resumption of economic activity will be key - crucially, much will also depend on the shape of the recovery, with some officials (like the Fed's Kashkari) not buying into the V-shaped narrative. Energy initially led the gains after OPEC+ agreed to cut production (see our recap here). Elsewhere, US lenders (JPM, WFC, BAC, C) are reportedly planning to operate oil and gas fields across the US to help reduce losses on loans to energy companies that could go bankrupt, according to people familiar with the matter. Financials underperforming ahead of earnings this week.&nbsp; Streaming names (AMZN, NFLX) traded firmer and were among outperformers in the NDX after the head of Amazon studios noted “the reports that we get are jaw-dropping, adding “across the board all the metrics are up significantly”. Cruise operators (CCL, NCLH, RCL) were hit (again) after the CDC expanded its “No Sail Order” by 100 days. SPX -1% at 2762, NDX +1.1% at 8333, DJI -1.4% at 23,394.</p><p>It is hard to read too much into Monday’s Treasury moves, particularly given many participants around the world are away for Easter. Yields were higher across the curve, and the shape of the curve was towards modest bear-steepening. However, the TPLEX was at odds with the cautious tone seen in other macro markets (equities down, crude mixed, gold to the best levels since 2012). Some desks had suggested that Treasuries were red due to positive comments by the CDC that the outbreak could peak this week. However, others have argued that the case counts/death tolls are now priced, with traders now focusing on when the economy re-opens, to what degree, and what shape the recovery will look like; Fed’s Kashkari on the weekend leaned-back against the notion of a V-shape recovery, and remarks from Fed’s Kashkari, who questioned any quick re-opening of the economy, as well as the notion of a V-shape recovery. Elsewhere, the NY Fed intends to reduce the frequency of overnight repo operations in light of more stable market conditions; will now conduct one overnight operation in the morning. It is also worth noting that the NY Fed will this week be purchasing assets at a pace of around USD 30bln per day, reduced from an average of USD 50bln per day last week. It is also worth noting that the NY Fed will be purchasing assets at a pace of around USD 30bln per day this week, reduced from an average of USD 50bln per day last week.

Desks noted profit-taking after a solid week for US stocks (and ahead of what is likely to be a grim earnings season), while the OPEC+ deal is not judged sufficient to balance the market by some analysts; additionally, in Europe, there was a little disappointment with the Eurogroup's latest measures to finance the virus response ('coronabonds' not included). When US participants arrived, however, the tone began shifting, with equity futures paring back losses and the curve bear-steepening after the cash open. However, that proved short-lived, and the S&amp;P 500 was enduring losses around 2% at one point, helping gold to rally to highs not seen since 2012, although the Treasury complex did not rally, with the curve bear-steepening. The focus will now be on earnings from JPM and WFC on Tuesday, as well as the much-touted meeting of the Texas Railroad Commission to discuss crude production in the state. On the virus front, there was another set of positive comments from NY Governor Cuomo, who suggested that the ‘worst is over’; some now think much of the positive virus news is priced in, with any further catalysts likely to depend on the COVID-19 showing a descending trend in both new cases and deaths, with positive developments on the vaccine front; additionally, a resumption of economic activity will be key - crucially, much will also depend on the shape of the recovery, with some officials (like the Fed's Kashkari) not buying into the V-shaped narrative.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>US: </strong>Cases +5.5% to 554,849 (Prev. 525,704, Friday: +15% to 493,567); death toll +7.1% to 21,942 (Prev. 20,486, Friday: +26 % to 18,544)</li><li><strong>NEW YORK:</strong> Cases +3.4% to 195,031 (Prev. +4.5% to 188,694, Friday: +6.6% to 170,512); Death toll +7.2% to 10,056 (Prev. +8.8% to 9385, Friday: +11% to 7,844)</li><li><strong>ITALY: </strong>Cases +2% to 159,516 (Prev. +2.68% to 156,363, Friday: +2.75% to 147,577); Death toll +2.84% to 20,465 (prev. +2.2% to 19,899, Friday +0.65% to 18,849)</li><li><strong>UK: </strong>Cases +5.2% to 88,621 (prev. +6.7% to 84,279); Death toll +11,329 (prev. 10,612); deaths rise by 717 (+6.76%) vs. yesterday's increase of 737 (+7.46%)</li></ul><p>Over the weekend, the US overtook Italy as the highest number of coronavirus deaths in which the total death toll stateside has now surpassed 22k. However, the director of the CDC Redfield expects the virus to begin to decline in the days ahead. NIH's Fauci said that parts of the economy could have a “rolling re-entry” as early as May provided that health authorities can quickly identify and isolate those who will inevitably be infected with the coronavirus. Furthermore, Italy extended its lockdown to May 3rd and it reported 431 additional coronavirus deaths which was its lowest daily death toll since March 19th, and France extended its lockdown to May 11th. On Sunday, Germany saw its smallest increase in the number of coronavirus cases in five days, with the deal toll rising by the second-lowest amount this month; a sign which many see as a moderation of the disease in Germany. Note, German Chancellor Merkel is due to meet with the various premiers from different regions on April 15th to discuss an exit plan from the current restriction. In the UK, the death toll breached the 10k mark with Saturday’s announcement noting an extra 917 deaths and another 737 on Sunday. UK lawmakers are required by law to make a decision on extending current measures by Thursday (Boris Johnson was released from hospital over the weekend), however, various UK press reports have opined that an extension of the existing measures is a near-certainty. India decided to extend the nationwide lockdown which was supposed to end on Tuesday after several states urged PM Modi to extend it in an effort to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, although source reports noted that India plans to restart some manufacturing sectors after April 15th amid lockdown. For reference, the Spanish count rose above 169k (Prev. 166k) and deaths to 17.48k (Prev. 16.9k).</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>Virus relief bill talks are expected to extend through the course of the week noting Democrats and Republicans are quite far apart, according to CNN citing a source. Adds, even if a deal can be struck, sides will need cooperation fully to speed it through Congress, a difficult undertaking.</p><p><strong>CORONAVIRUS:</strong> New York Governor Cuomo stated “we are controlling the spread” and, “I think you can say the worst is over”, however, he later noted he was not confident the worst is behind us and stressed the need for everyone to continue sticking to rules, noting we can get by this providing we do not do something out of the ordinary. Cuomo later announced NY is to co-ordinate a re-open with New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island Governors after the coronavirus shutdown. NJ Governor Murphy stated his state has not plateaued and is a couple of beats behind New York, while Connecticut Governor Lamont noted the importance of not pulling the trigger too early on the reopening.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>Fed Vice Chair Clarida (voter) says talk of a rate hike is a long way away; Fed not undertaking yield curve control but will keep rates low until the economy is back on track. Clarida says the virus will be disinflationary, though the Fed has tools to avoid deflation, and is confident the measures can be scaled-back at an appropriate time. Clarida says the expansion of the Fed’s virus programme to include some junk bonds was to help companies that were IG before the crisis. <strong>Fed’s</strong> <strong>Kashkari</strong> (voter, dove) on Sunday warned that the US economy faces an 18-month strategy of rolling shutdowns until a therapy or a vaccine for coronavirus is developed and added that it was hard for him to see a V-shaped recovery under that scenario<strong>. Fed's Mester</strong> (voter, hawk) on Saturday said economic data would be 'very ugly' in the near-term, and policymaker's focus was on helping to ensure that the shutdown does not cause lasting damage to the economy. <strong>Fed vice chair Quarles</strong> said Fed measures are designed to ensure that the economy can be revived without permanent damage. <strong>Fed’s Bostic (Non-voter)</strong> is optimistic about both the Fed’s and Congress’ response to the COVID-19 crisis, adding the recovery should be more robust than a typical recession.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE/UK</strong></h2><p><i><strong>NB: Away for Easter Monday</strong></i></p><p><strong>UK Foreign Secretary Raab</strong> stated the government does not yet believe the UK has reached the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Raab added he does not expect to ease lockdown measures this week; citizens had been eyeing an update on the current lockdown situation by Thursday.</p><p><strong>French President Macron</strong> extended the coronavirus lockdown until May 11 and is to extend aid measures for companies and workers hit by the coronavirus.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLES USD 0.35 LOWER AT USD 22.41/BBL, WTI (M0) SETTLES USD 0.44 HIGHER AT USD 29.26/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 0.26 HIGHER AT USD 31.74/BBL</strong></p><p><strong>OPEC DEAL RECAP: </strong>OPEC+ on Sunday finally agreed to cut output, after overcoming opposition by Mexico. The group will cut production by 9.7mln BPD in May and June, and then taper to 8mln BPD through the end of 2020, and taper again to 6mln BPD of cuts from Jan 2021 to April 2022. It will meet on 10th June to evaluate progress. The US, Canada, and Brazil will contribute an additional 3.7mln BPD of cuts as production declines over the course of the year (\"organic cuts\"). Iran, Libya, and Venezuela are to once again be exempt, while Mexico has reportedly agreed to cut by 100k BPD, short of the 400k BPD the group was initially pitching. The reference point for cuts will be October 2018 output levels. ING emphasises that this is not a 10mln BPD cut from 1Q20 levels - given that output was higher during the reference month for this deal, the effective cut from 1Q20 levels is more in the region of 7mln BPD over May and June, and then around 5mln BPD for the remainder of the year. \"So while the cuts are significant, they are not as big as the headline numbers suggest, and therefore not as bullish as one would imagine.\" TD Securities says the deal will bring the oil market into balance this year. \"The problem is that the massive drop in demand in April and early-May, which could be as much as 25-30mln BPD is much greater than all the proposed cuts,\" and as such, \"there will be very large inventory accumulation and the prospect for many delivery hubs to be overwhelmed, which could force prices lower.\" TD warns that there is still a high risk that all crude storage capacity could be filled completely in some locations, leading to a forced shutdown of production, which TD says would generate extremely low prices to incentivise supply curtailments. Combined with the demand uncertainty due to COVID-19, and that market participants do not know the path for cuts from US, Brazilian and Canada, prices should only move modestly higher in the medium-term, TD says, and WTI will face stiff resistance at around USD 30 per barrel in the near-term. The bank sees Brent moving to USD 39/bbl into Q3.</p><p><strong>ANALYST TAKE: </strong>Citi says the market views the OPEC+ deal as supportive for prices in the second half of the year and 2021, supporting that part of the curve while the nearby contracts are showing only minor gains. \"The 'super contango' is looking even more super as a result,\" Citi said. With regards to the actual cuts, these have been in line with expectations on Thursday. However, the bank notes that efforts to frame the deal as a global production cut worth around 20mln BPD (a line pushed by US President Trump and the Saudi energy minister) overstates the commitment; \"US production will decline over the balance of the year and into 2021, but it will be on a glide path lower, not a dramatic drop,\" Citi notes. Additionally, question marks still exist over the demand-side of the equation; \"Once the initial market reaction has run its course, we expect this current supply/demand surplus reality will remain.\"</p><p><strong>TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION: </strong>Texas regulators are to meet on 14th April to discuss production curbs in the state and may vote on any resolution a week later, it has previously been reported.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan Sitton has previously said that it was the duty of regulators to consider cuts; however, his statement after the OPEC+ meeting has cooled that talk: \"I have not advocated for Texas to prorate. I have advocated that we consider it. I felt that we should be open to evaluating any path that helps to bring the international oil community together in a global deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I have been public about my thoughts that Texas should take a lead role in this conversation, I still have many reservations, and I will be examining heavily if and how proration could be done.\" Note,<strong> </strong>Sitton is a lame duck on the Commission, having lost in the March primary to a challenger, and his term concludes in December; the state's two other regulators, Wayne Christian and Christi Craddick, have not publicly endorsed cuts.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-02+</strong></p><p>It is hard to read too much into Monday’s Treasury moves, particularly given many participants around the world are away for Easter. Yields were higher across the curve, and the shape of the curve was towards modest bear-steepening. However, the TPLEX was at odds with the cautious tone seen in other macro markets (equities down, crude mixed, gold to the best levels since 2012). Some desks had suggested that Treasuries were red due to positive comments by the CDC that the outbreak could peak this week. However, others have argued that the case counts/death tolls are now priced, with traders now focusing on when the economy re-opens, to what degree, and what shape the recovery will look like; Fed’s Kashkari on the weekend leaned-back against the notion of a V-shape recovery, and remarks from Fed’s Kashkari, who questioned any quick re-opening of the economy, as well as the notion of a V-shape recovery. Elsewhere, the NY Fed intends to reduce the frequency of overnight repo operations in light of more stable market conditions; will now conduct one overnight operation in the morning. It is also worth noting that the NY Fed will this week be purchasing assets at a pace of around USD 30bln per day, reduced from an average of USD 50bln per day last week.

Elsewhere, US lenders (JPM, WFC, BAC, C) are reportedly planning to operate oil and gas fields across the US to help reduce losses on loans to energy companies that could go bankrupt, according to people familiar with the matter. Financials underperforming ahead of earnings this week.&nbsp; Streaming names (AMZN, NFLX) traded firmer and were among outperformers in the NDX after the head of Amazon studios noted “the reports that we get are jaw-dropping, adding “across the board all the metrics are up significantly”. Cruise operators (CCL, NCLH, RCL) were hit (again) after the CDC expanded its “No Sail Order” by 100 days. Ford (F) pre-announced earnings, issuing a revenue warning where it expects a pre-tax loss of USD 600mln and expects Q1 revenue to be -15.7% Y/Y to USD 34bln; CFO said it has “sufficient cash today to get us through at least the end of the third quarter with no incremental vehicle production and wholesales or financing actions”. RBC highlights this implies they are burning roughly USD 1.2bln a week. Tesla (TSLA) surged after it begun sales in China of two or more Model 3 variants which are manufactured in China (thus not subject to import tax). Apple Inc.

While it is also teaming up with Google (GOOG) to create technology that will alert users if they have come into contact with a person with COVID-19. Facebook (FB) March advertising rates declined by up to 25% M/M, according to WSJ. Macy's Inc.

Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) were double upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Credit Suisse, Micron (MU) downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS SEASON:</strong> The Q1 2020 corporate earnings calendar picks up this week. According to Refinitiv, Q1 2020 earnings are expected to decrease by 9.0% Y/Y; analysts expect Q1 2020 revenue to increase by 0.7% Y/Y (1.9% Y/Y ex-energy). The consensus expects the communications and IT sectors to notch the best earnings growth rates Y/Y, while energy is expected to be the laggard). However, given that reports will be impacted by COVID-19, analysts will be keeping an eye on forward guidance. Morgan Stanley points out that corporates have been withdrawing guidance at a more elevated rate over the past few weeks, concentrated in Cap Goods, Materials, Retailing, Real Estate and Consumer Services. \"For earnings the US equity team employed a bottom up approach to do so and found that EPS could be down in the mid-20s in 2020 and then up in the low 30s (on a % basis) in 2021.\" MS continues to maintain an S&amp;P 500 target range off 2,400-3,000 for end-2020; 2,700 is based off USD 142 in S&amp;P earning this year, -13% year over year or 17x next-year’s earnings of USD 159. Major banks JPM and WFC will report on Tuesday, and analysts will be keeping an eye on credit and capital.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS GUIDANCE: </strong>Goldman Sachs analysts say 2021 earnings guidance will be more important for stock prices. The bank explains that price/earnings multiples are most frequently calculated on forward 12-month EPS, but it believes that multiples on 2021 EPS more accurately reflect most investors’ current framework. \"Although our macro valuation model indicates an FY2 P/E multiple of 12x, the index level and consensus 2021 EPS forecast of $177 equates to a P/E multiple of 16x,\" the bank writes, \"if consensus EPS forecasts are revised lower, as we expect, the implied market multiple will become even more elevated.\" In other words, GS' macro valuation model indicates that \"either the S&amp;P 500 index should be 25% lower, consensus 2021 EPS should be 25% higher, or that equity valuations today are tied more closely to policy support and investor sentiment than to the traditional drivers captured in our model.\"</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p>A thin feel to FX, though the bias seems to be towards caution. In major FX, the dollar is flat, and EUR weaker; analysts were encouraged by the package to finance the bloc's virus response, struck on Friday, though many have expressed disappointment at the lack of 'coronabonds'. The pound is up after PM Johnson exited ICU late Friday. Haven FX is seemingly in demand, with JPY firmer and XAU topping USD 1,700 to the best levels since December 2012. EMFX has started the week on the back foot; Citi reasoned that while G10 coronavirus curves appear to be flattening, the same cannot be said for much of EM, while US corporate earnings gets underway this week, amid estimates being revised down sharply by analysts. Commodity FX is mixed; the likes of RUB and NOK are weaker, faded in wake of the OPEC+ deal to curb supply (although CAD is up against the buck ahead of Wednesday’s BOC); analysts at Goldman Sachs said it was not enough to offset the demand hit from the virus fallout, and sees downside risks to its short-term USD 20 per barrel forecast. But AUD continues its recovery (and NZD is up too), while CAD is higher ahead of the BOC's policy meeting this week (Poloz last).</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>OPEC DEAL RECAP: </strong>OPEC+ on Sunday finally agreed to cut output, after overcoming opposition by Mexico. The group will cut production by 9.7mln BPD in May and June, and then taper to 8mln BPD through the end of 2020, and taper again to 6mln BPD of cuts from Jan 2021 to April 2022. It will meet on 10th June to evaluate progress. The US, Canada and Brazil will contribute an additional 3.7mln BPD of cuts as production declines over the course of the year (\"organic cuts\"). Iran, Libya and Venezuela are to once again be exempt, while Mexico has reportedly agreed to cut by 100k BPD, short of the 400k BPD the group was initially pitching. The reference point for cuts will be October 2018 output levels. ING emphasises that this is not a 10mln BPD cut from 1Q20 levels - given that output was higher during the reference month for this deal, the effective cut from 1Q20 levels is more in the region of 7mln BPD over May and June, and then around 5mln BPD for the remainder of the year. \"So while the cuts are significant, they are not as big as the headline numbers suggest, and therefore not as bullish as one would imagine.\" TD Securities says the deal will bring the oil market into balance this year. \"The problem is that the massive drop in demand in April and early-May, which could be as much as 25-30mln BPD is much greater than all the proposed cuts,\" and as such, \"there will be very large inventory accumulation and the prospect for many delivery hubs to be overwhelmed, which could force prices lower.\" TD warns that there is still a high risk that all crude storage capacity could be filled completely in some locations, leading to a forced shutdown of production, which TD says would generate extremely low prices to incentivise supply curtailments. Combined with the demand uncertainty due to COVID-19, and that market participants do not know the path for cuts from US, Brazilian and Canada, prices should only move modestly higher in the medium-term, TD says, and WTI will face stiff resistance at around USD 30 per barrel in the near-term. The bank sees Brent moving to USD 39/bbl into Q3.</li><li><strong>ANALYST TAKE: </strong>Citi says the market views the OPEC+ deal as supportive for prices in the second half of the year and 2021, supporting that part of the curve while the nearby contracts are showing only minor gains. \"The 'super contango' is looking even more super as a result,\" Citi said. With regards to the actual cuts, these have been in line with expectations on Thursday. However, the bank notes that efforts to frame the deal as a global production cut worth around 20mln BPD (a line pushed by US President Trump and the Saudi energy minister) overstates the commitment; \"US production will decline over the balance of the year and into 2021, but it will be on a glide path lower, not a dramatic drop,\" Citi notes. Additionally, question marks still exist over the demand-side of the equation; \"Once the initial market reaction has run its course, we expect this current supply/demand surplus reality will remain.\"</li></ul><p><strong>PRIMER: Texas regulators are to meet on 14th April to discuss production curbs in the state</strong></p><ul><li>Texas regulators are to meet on 14th April to discuss production curbs in the state, and may vote on any resolution a week later, it has previously been reported.</li><li>Ryan Sitton has previously said that it was the duty of regulators to consider cuts; however, his statement after the OPEC+ meeting has cooled that talk: \"I have not advocated for Texas to prorate. I have advocated that we consider it. I felt that we should be open to evaluating any path that helps to bring the international oil community together in a global deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I have been public about my thoughts that Texas should take a lead role in this conversation, I still have many reservations, and I will be examining heavily if and how proration could be done.\"</li><li>Note, Sitton is a lame duck on the Commission, having lost in the March primary to a challenger, and his term concludes in December; the state's two other regulators, Wayne Christian and Christi Craddick, have not publicly endorsed cuts.</li></ul>",

Outside of OPEC, the US, Canada, and Brazil will cut 3.7mln BPD over the year. (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/opec-recap-group-strikes-deal-to-cut-output-13-04-2020\">See our recap here</a>). Elsewhere, US lenders (JPM, WFC, BAC, C) are reportedly planning to operate oil and gas fields across the US to help reduce losses on loans to energy companies that could go bankrupt, according to people familiar with the matter. Financials underperforming at the open ahead of earnings this week.</li><li><strong>STOCK NEWS:</strong> Apple Inc. (AAPL) is reportedly preparing a redesign of its top-tier iPhones, taking inspiration from its latest iPads. While it is also teaming up with Google (GOOG) to create technology which will alert users if they have come into contact with a person with COVID-19. Facebook, Inc. (FB) March advertising rates declined by up to 25% M/M, according to WSJ. Macy's Inc. (M) has reportedly hired Lazard (LAZ) to help the co. explore options to boost its finances after the closure of its stores due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to people familiar with the matter. &nbsp;The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is furloughing 43k workers at its Disney World resort in Florida but the employees will maintain benefits throughout the rest of the year. While separate reports note its former CEO, Bob Iger, has returned to duty to help the business amid the coronavirus pandemic. Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced a 53-person study on patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with its remdesivir, 68% of patients saw an improvement in oxygen support. Elsewhere, GILD must pay an increased USD 1.2bln to Bristol Myers (BMY) in a patent infringement case on technology for treating cancer. Ford (F) also hit on a revenue warning amid the coronavirus pandemic. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) were double upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Credit Suisse, Micron (MU) downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs.</li><li><strong>OPEC+ DEAL RECAP:</strong> OPEC+ on Sunday finally agreed to cut output, after overcoming opposition by Mexico. The group will cut production by 9.7mln BPD in May and June, and then taper to 8mln BPD through the end of 2020, and taper again to 6mln BPD of cuts from Jan 2021 to April 2022. It will meet on 10th June to evaluate progress. The US, Canada and Brazil will contribute an additional 3.7mln BPD of cuts as production declines over the course of the year (\"organic cuts\"). Iran, Libya and Venezuela are to once again be exempt. The reference point for cuts will be October 2018 output levels. ING emphasises that this is not a 10mln BPD cut from 1Q20 levels - given that output was higher during the reference month for this deal, the effective cut from 1Q20 levels is more in the region of 7mln BPD over May and June, and then around 5mln BPD for the remainder of the year. \"So while the cuts are significant, they are not as big as the headline numbers suggest, and therefore not as bullish as one would imagine.\" TD Securities says the deal will bring the oil market into balance this year. \"The problem is that the massive drop in demand in April and early-May, which could be as much as 25-30mln BPD is much greater than all the proposed cuts,\" and as such, \"there will be very large inventory accumulation and the prospect for many delivery hubs to be overwhelmed, which could force prices lower.\" TD warns that there is still a high risk that all crude storage capacity could be filled completely in some locations, leading to a forced shutdown of production, which TD says would generate extremely low prices to incentivise supply curtailments. Combined with the demand uncertainty due to COVID-19, and that market participants do not know the path for cuts from US, Brazilian and Canada, prices should only move modestly higher in the medium-term, TD says, and WTI will face stiff resistance at around USD 30bln per barrel in the near-term. The bank sees Brent moving to USD 39/bbl into Q3.</li><li><strong>EARNINGS SEASON: </strong>The Q1 2020 corporate earnings calendar picks up this week. According to Refinitiv, Q1 2020 earnings are expected to decrease 9.0% Y/Y; analysts expect Q1 2020 revenue to increase 0.7% Y/Y (1.9% Y/Y ex-energy). The consensus expects the communications and IT sectors to notch the best earnings growth rates Y/Y, while energy is expected to be the laggard). However, given that reports will be impacted by COVID-19, analysts will be keeping an eye on forward guidance. Morgan Stanley points out that corporates have been withdrawing guidance at a more elevated rate over the past few weeks, concentrated in Cap Goods, Materials, Retailing, Real Estate and Consumer Services. \"For earnings the US equity team employed a bottom up approach to do so and found that EPS could be down in the mid-20s in 2020 and then up in the low 30s (on a % basis) in 2021.\" MS continues to maintain an S&amp;P 500 target range off 2,400-3,000 for end-2020; 2,700 is based off USD 142 in S&amp;P earning this year, -13% year over year or 17x next-year’s earnings of USD 159. Major banks JPM and WFC will report on Tuesday, and analysts will be keeping an eye on credit and capital.</li><li><strong>EARNINGS GUIDANC</strong>E: Goldman Sachs analysts say 2021 earnings guidance will be more important for stock prices. The bank explains that price/earnings multiples are most frequently calculated on forward 12-month EPS, but it believes that multiples on 2021 EPS more accurately reflect most investors’ current framework. \"Although our macro valuation model indicates a FY2 P/E multiple of 12x, the index level and consensus 2021 EPS forecast of $177 equates to a P/E multiple of 16x,\" the bank writes, \"if consensus EPS forecasts are revised lower, as we expect, the implied market multiple will become even more elevated.\" In other words, GS' macro valuation model indicates that \"either the S&amp;P 500 index should be 25% lower, consensus 2021 EPS should be 25% higher, or that equity valuations today are tied more closely to policy support and investor sentiment than to the traditional drivers captured in our model.\"</li><li><strong>NDX INDICATOR:</strong> Nomura’s quants say that although investor sentiment has been picking up, particularly in the US, there remains uncertainties of COVID’s impact on the economy which is leaving many to doubt the longevity on the stock rebound, which seems to have been underpinned by monetary easing. Gains in developed markets have been driven by systematic traders exiting bearish trades, Nomura says, with CTAs covering shorts in equity futures (appears to be fully completed now), and risk-parity funds beginning to resume buying HY bonds and equities. “In a market dominated by technically oriented short-term bulls, we think fundamentals-oriented investors that have been on the defensive will soon have to decide whether to accumulate more short positions or back out of their existing positions.” Nomura’s quants have recently suggested keeping an eye on Nasdaq 100 as an indicator, arguing that median historical patterns suggests CTAs buying of NDX futures may run out of steam around 22nd April.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CORONAVIRUS: </strong>Over the weekend, the US overtook Italy as the highest number of coronavirus deaths in which the total death toll stateside has now surpassed 22k. However, the director of the CDC Redfield expects the virus to begin to decline in the days ahead. NIH's Fauci said that parts of the economy could have a “rolling reentry” as early as May provided that health authorities can quickly identify and isolate those who will inevitably be infected with the coronavirus. Furthermore, Italy extended its lockdown to May 3rd and it reported 431 additional coronavirus deaths which was its lowest daily death toll since March 19th. On Sunday, Germany saw its smallest increase in the amount of coronavirus cases in 5 days, with the deal toll rising by the second-lowest amount this month; a sign which many see as a moderation of the disease in Germany. <i>Note, German Chancellor Merkel is due to meet with the various premiers from different regions on April 15th to discuss an exit plan from the current restriction. In the UK, the death toll breached the 10k mark with Saturday’s announcement noting an extra 917 deaths and another 737 on Sunday. UK lawmakers are required by law to make a decision on extending current measures by Thursday (Boris Johnson was released from hospital over the weekend), however, various UK press reports have opined that an extension of the existing measures is a near-certainty. </i>India decided to extend the nationwide lockdown which was supposed to end on Tuesday after several states urged PM Modi to extend it in an effort to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, although source reports noted that India plans to restart some manufacturing sectors after April 15th amid lockdown.&nbsp;For reference, the Spanish count rose above 169k (Prev. 166k) and deaths to 17.48k (Prev. 16.9k).</p><p><strong>OIL: </strong>OPEC+ resolved the stand-off with Mexico on Sunday and approved its largest ever oil cut in which it agreed to cuts of 9.7mln bpd for May-June, after June, the cut will be reduced to 7.6mln bpd until the end of the year and then to 5.6mln bpd from the beginning of next year until April 2022. Note, Russian and Saudi baselines for their cuts stand at 11mln bpd and gas condensate will be exempted from the quotas. Additionally, it was reported that Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait will collectively lower production by 2mln bpd above their quota. The stalemate between Saudi Arabia and Mexico was overcome by the US’ agreement to contribute 300k bpd worth of cuts on behalf of Mexico, allowing Mexico to contribute the 100k bpd that it was willing to. External to OPEC+ US, Canada and Brazil will provide another approximately 3.7mln bpd worth of cuts, however, it is currently unclear how much of that figure will be made up from real cuts or those that will occur due to market forces/lower prices. Norwegian Oil Minister Bru said that the nation will soon take their decision on potential oil output cuts.In response to the deal, Saudi's King Salman, Russian President Putin and US President Trump expressed comfort with the outcome of the OPEC+ meeting and stressed that producing countries need to fulfil their responsibilities to stabilize oil markets and support global economy.&nbsp;The IEA said it will provide updates on global oil supply and demand imbalances on Wednesday, as well as plans by some consumer countries to raise strategic reserves. Furthermore, other reports noted that IEA will announce on Monday oil purchases into reserves that will contribute towards effective oil output cuts, according to sources. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the OPEC deal is historic but insufficient, while it suggested the cuts were too little too late and that it expects crude prices to fall in the coming weeks. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs said no voluntary cuts would be enough to offset 19mln bpd demand loss in April and May, while it added that assuming full core-OPEC compliance and 50% compliance by others in May, the 10mln bpd output reduction would lead to an actual 4.1mln bpd cut.</p><p>Saudi Arabia OSP’s for May Arab Light Crude – Asia: USD -7.3/bbl vs. Oman/Dubai average. North-West Europe: USD -10.25/bbl vs. ICE Brent. US: USD -0.75/bbl vs. ASCI.</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC SESSION RECAP: </strong>Asian equity markets were subdued amid the holiday-thinned conditions and oil price volatility, while coronavirus concerns also lingered after the US recently suffered the highest number of coronavirus daily casualties and surpassed Italy with the largest total death toll of more than 22k. US equity futures were also lacklustre after they shrugged off opening gains alongside fluctuations in oil prices following the OPEC+ breakthrough with Mexico in which producers agreed to cuts of 9.7mln bpd for May-June and suggested that total global oil cuts effective next month will total more than 20mln bpd, although oil prices briefly turned negative as some were not convinced including Goldman Sachs which suggested the deal was insufficient and that the cuts were too little too late. In terms of the regional indices, Nikkei 225 (-2.3%) was lacklustre amid the coronavirus-related disruptions to industries and unfavourable currency moves, while KOSPI (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) were also downbeat with the latter not helped by PBoC liquidity inaction and the absence of participants in Hong Kong, which alongside Australia, New Zealand, UK and EU all observe Easter Monday holidays. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively unchanged despite the humdrum tone in the region and BoJ’s presence in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>During the overnight session, the DXY was sluggish around April lows near the 99.50 level amid various coronavirus-related headlines in which the US became the first to suffer over 2000 deaths in one day on Friday, although this has since eased back to around 1500 on Sunday whilst NIH’s Fauci suggested the US economy could open in some ways next month. EUR/USD and GBP/USD were steady at the 1.0900 and 1.2400 handles respectively due to the mass holiday closures across Europe, although the latter edged marginal gains after rebounding off support at 1.2450 and amid news PM Johnson was discharged from hospital. Price action in USD/JPY was at the whim of the lacklustre tone which saw the pair breach 108.00 to the downside, while AUD, NZD and CAD were indecisive amid the fluctuations in oil and uninspired risk sentiment. Elsewhere, TRY saw a bout of pressure in early trade after Turkey’s banking watchdog reduced banks’ forex swap, forward and option transactions limits with foreign entities to 1% from 10% and the country’s Interior Minister resigned from position (over the short-notice coronavirus weekend curfew) which President Erdogan rejected.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

Fed's Mester (voter, hawk) on Saturday said economic data would be 'very ugly' in the near-term, and policymaker's focus was on helping to ensure that the shutdown does not cause lasting damage to the economy. Fed vice chair Quarles said Fed measures are designed to ensure that the economy can be revived without permanent damage. Vice Chair Clarida (voter, neutral) noted on Monday that the Fed’s program is so far an ambitious and appropriate response to the crisis and the FOMC has the tools to keep the US from avoiding deflation, but measures will be scaled back at an “appropriate time”. Furthermore, Clarida said that rates will be kept low until the economy is on track but the FOMC is not carrying out yield curve control.</p><p><strong>TURKEY: </strong>Turkey’s banking watchdog reduced banks’ forex swap, forward and option transactions limits with foreign entities to 1% from 10%.

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>CRUDE: </strong>OPEC+ on Sunday finally agreed to cut output, after overcoming opposition by Mexico. The group will cut production by 9.7mln BPD in May and June, and then taper to 8mln BPD through the end of 2020, and taper again to 6mln BPD of cuts from Jan 2021 to April 2022. It will meet on 10th June to evaluate progress. The US, Canada and Brazil will contribute an additional 3.7mln BPD of cuts as production declines over the course of the year (\"organic cuts\"). Iran, Libya and Venezuela are to once again be exempt, while Mexico has reportedly agreed to cut by 100k BPD, short of the 400k BPD the group was initially pitching.</li><li><strong>REFERENCE POINT FOR CUTS: </strong>The reference point for cuts will be October 2018 output levels. ING emphasises that this is not a 10mln BPD cut from 1Q20 levels - given that output was higher during the reference month for this deal, the effective cut from 1Q20 levels is more in the region of 7mln BPD over May and June, and then around 5mln BPD for the remainder of the year. \"So while the cuts are significant, they are not as big as the headline numbers suggest, and therefore not as bullish as one would imagine.\"</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/eed9cd31-8296-45f2-908c-fec273a2a2ba.jpg\"></figure><ul><li><strong>MARKET BALANCE: </strong>TD Securities says the deal will bring the oil market into balance this year. \"The problem is that the massive drop in demand in April and early-May, which could be as much as 25-30mln BPD is much greater than all the proposed cuts,\" and as such, \"there will be very large inventory accumulation and the prospect for many delivery hubs to be overwhelmed, which could force prices lower.\" TD warns that there is still a high risk that all crude storage capacity could be filled completely in some locations, leading to a forced shutdown of production, which TD says would generate extremely low prices to incentivise supply curtailments. Combined with the demand uncertainty due to COVID-19, and that market participants do not know the path for cuts from US, Brazilian and Canada, prices should only move modestly higher in the medium-term, TD says, and WTI will face stiff resistance at around USD 30 per barrel in the near-term.

US equity futures were also lacklustre after they shrugged off opening gains alongside fluctuations in oil prices following the OPEC+ breakthrough with Mexico in which producers agreed to cuts of 9.7mln bpd for May-June and suggested that total global oil cuts effective next month will total more than 20mln bpd, although oil prices briefly turned negative as some were not convinced including Goldman Sachs which suggested the deal was insufficient and that the cuts were too little too late. In terms of the regional indices, Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) was lacklustre amid the coronavirus-related disruptions to industries and unfavourable currency moves, while KOSPI (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were also downbeat with the latter not helped by PBoC liquidity inaction and the absence of participants in Hong Kong, which alongside Australia, New Zealand, UK and EU all observe Easter Monday holidays. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively unchanged despite the humdrum tone in the region and BoJ’s presence in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are subdued amid the holiday-thinned conditions and oil price volatility, while coronavirus concerns also linger after the US recently suffered the highest number of coronavirus daily casualties and surpassed Italy with the largest total death toll of more than 22k. US equity futures are lacklustre after shrugging off opening gains alongside fluctuations in oil prices following the OPEC+ breakthrough with Mexico in which producers agreed to cuts of 9.7mln bpd for May-June and suggested that total global oil cuts effective next month will total more than 20mln bpd, although some were not convinced and oil prices briefly turned negative with Goldman Sachs suggesting the deal was insufficient and that the cuts were too little too late. In terms of the regional indices, Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) is lacklustre amid the coronavirus-related disruptions to industries and unfavourable currency moves but has recouped the majority of its opening losses, while KOSPI (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are also downbeat with the latter not helped by PBoC liquidity inaction and the absence of participants in Hong Kong, which alongside Australia, New Zealand, UK and EU all observe Easter Monday holidays.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is sluggish around April lows near the 99.50 level amid conflicting coronavirus-related headlines in which the US became the first to suffer over 2000 deaths in one day on Friday, although this has since eased back to around 1500 on Sunday and NIH’s Fauci suggested the US economy could open in some ways next month. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are steady at the 1.0900 and 1.2400 handles respectively heading into the mass holiday closures across Europe, although the latter edges marginal gains after rebounding off support at 1.2450 and amid news PM Johnson was discharged from hospital. Price action in USD/JPY was at the whim of the lacklustre tone which saw the pair briefly test 108.00 to the downside, while AUD, NZD and CAD were indecisive amid the fluctuations in oil and uninspired risk sentiment. Elsewhere, TRY saw a bout of pressure in early trade after Turkey’s banking watchdog reduced banks’ forex swap, forward and option transactions limits with foreign entities to 1% from 10% and the country’s Interior Minister resigned from position (over the short-notice coronavirus weekend curfew) which President Erdogan rejected.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively unchanged with only minimal gains seen despite the humdrum tone in the region and BoJ’s presence in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",
