Pantheon Macroeconomics says the data were previously impacted by the government shutdown as well as the stock slide in Q4, and therefore, a rebound was likely. &quot;The reported plunge in December retail sales might have made some forecasters hold back, but we don&rsquo;t believe the numbers and we expect them to be revised up substantially,&quot; Pantheon says, &quot;the ISM data support our view that the much stronger Redbook chain store sales numbers more accurately reflect the strength of spending over the holidays,&quot; and &quot;sales growth is now slowing, though, as the boost from the tax cuts and the drop in gas prices fades, so further sustained gains in the ISM non-manufacturing headline are unlikely.&quot; Ahead of Friday&#39;s NFP data, there was also some attention on the employment component, which slipped by over two points to 55.2. Pantheon still thinks that is solid, but it suggests that labour demand is now running at a 200k monthly clip vs the 250k+ that was signalled last summer/fall. &quot;Labour supply could not keep up with demand at that pace, so the slowing in demand now, as the tax cuts fade, does not necessarily mean that payroll growth will materially soften,&quot; Pantheon says, &quot;For now, though, what matters is the strong-looking headline, which should help offset some of the fears triggered by the aggressive manufacturing downshift.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEW HOME SALES (DEC): </strong>Although December new home sale printed a 3.7% rise - above the expected 8.7% fall - this was overshadowed by downward revisions to previous data. Analysts at Wells Fargo Economics highlight that &ldquo;Sales ended the year just 1.5% ahead of 2017&rsquo;s pace, the weakest annual gain since 2011.&rdquo; The dwindling figures at the end of last year were most likely heavily induced by rising rates. However, following a rate reversal, &ldquo;lower mortgage rates should fuel improvements in coming months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: Fed&#39;s Rosengren (voter, hawk)</strong> said a rate hike should be on the table this year provided that the economy meets his outlook. Rosengren said that in the face of heightened risks, policymakers can be patient; risks to the outlook have increased recently. He adds that earlier concerns that the economy might overheat in a number of ways seem somewhat less pressing at this juncture, and that there is some risk that more pronounced slowdowns in the rest of the world could dampen US growth. <strong>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove)</strong> said increasing US corporate debt is one factor in wanting patience on rates. <strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove)</strong> says he is doing everything he can to avoid lifting rates, which he believes would end the expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW:</strong> BOC to keep rates on hold at 1.75%, analysts say. Rate decision 1500 GMT/1000 EST on 6 March 2019; statement-only meeting. Dep Gov Patterson will deliver the Economic Progress report the next day. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21308/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHINA NPC: </strong>The NPC lowered the target growth for the year to 6-6.5% from &#39;around 6.5%&#39;, more or less in line with the consensus; China also announced further tax cuts and fiscal stimulus through infrastructure investments, and loans to small businesses. The deficit target was set at 2.8% of GDP (Street looked for somewhere between 2.6% and 3%); there were reiterations that monpol would be kept prudent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK AG Cox and Brexit Sec Barclay were in Brussels today, attempting to renegotiate the Irish backstop proposal ahead of next week&#39;s series of Meaningful Votes in Parliament (12-14 March). Ahead of the meeting, two EU officials said that the UK is examining whether the 1969 Vienna Convention could provide any legal wiggle-room to engineer a deal. It was later reported that a UK official downplayed the chances of any deal coming from today&#39;s meeting, injecting a negative bias into GBP on Tuesday. Elsewhere, there were reports that the UK is to cut tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE GOVERNOR CARNEY: </strong>The BoE&rsquo;s Governor Carney caught the sterling market off guard on Tuesday, at a House of Lords hearing, where he said the bank&rsquo;s rate path might not be high enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLED USD 0.03 LOWER AT USD 56.56/BBL, BRENT (J9) SETTLED USD 0.19 HIGHER AT USD 65.86/BBL.</strong> Crude prices were mixed on Tuesday, where a slew of positive PMI data from Europe heightened risk appetite. However, prices pared back gains after the US equity open, where a recent trend has developed of equities selling off just as Europeans begin leaving their desks. Alongside the equity sell off, a strong ISM non-mfg headline figure saw a spike in the dollar, further leading to negative ticks in oil prices. On the supply side of the equation, Libya&rsquo;s El Sharara oilfield production increased to 80k BPD from 30k BPD yesterday after the force majeure was lifted. The Venezuelan, state-owned PDVSA&#39;s Isla refinery (335k BPD) is reported to stay shut through 2019 due to sanctions. The market is looking ahead to tonight&rsquo;s APIs to gauge energy inventories ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s official DOE release, following last week&rsquo;s extreme crude stock draw of over 8mln bbls. Crude stocks are seen building by 1.2mln bbls, distillates drawing 1.4mln bbls and gasoline drawing 2.1mln bbls; Genscape forecasts the key Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub building 373k bbls. This Friday the CFTC will release its COT data, which will finally be up to date following the US shutdown, although data has been laggard for WTI, &nbsp;analysts at PVM note an &ldquo;obvious trend&rdquo; of how money managers have been favouring Brent in comparison to WTI recently, despite WTI&rsquo;s recent rise, where &ldquo;Brent speculators have added 130 million bbls to their net exposure this year whilst WTI financial investors have cut their net speculative length by 12mln bbls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.11% at 2790, NDX +0.08% at 7157, DJI -0.05% at 25807. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.32%, Materials -0.50%, Industrials -0.64%, Cons Discretionary +0.20%, Cons Staples -0.04%, Healthcare -0.07%, Financials -0.33%, Tech -0.29%, Telecoms +0.73%, Utilities -0.17%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Some strong earnings from the retail sector on Tuesday: Target (TGT) surged on beating top and bottom line estimates as well as SSS expectations, it also raised guidance; Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS) too surged on a top and bottom line beat as well as raising its guidance. Delta Air Lines (DAL) outperformed in the midst of the JPMorgan Aviation conference where it affirmed its earnings guidance; later on at the conference, General Electric (GE) tanked after announcing it would see negative industrial FCF in 2019. Salesforce (CRM) drifted lower despite beating EPS and revenue estimates, however it did not raise its guidance. Align Technology. Tesla (TSLA) dipped again, this time following reports of Chinese customs holding over 1,500 Tesla vehicles due to &ldquo;improper labelling&rdquo;. Ctrip (CTRP) made large gains after reporting a surprise profit. Hertz (HTZ) dropped after investor Carl Icahn lowered his stake. Alnylam (ALNY) benefitted from an upgrade at Morgan Stanley who are optimistic on its Opattro drug launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURE (H9) SETTLES HALF-A-TICK HIGHER AT 121-22. </strong>The complex ends the day with yields a touch higher, partly on the back of a decent headline for the Feb ISM non-manufacturing survey, while some traders cited decent corporate earnings from Target (TGT) which pushed back on some data hinting at a slowdown in the retail sector. The developments helped shrug-off overnight &#39;risk-off&#39; stories (China PMIs, China cutting growth). Major curve spreads were mixed heading into the close.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The EUR seems to be lacking any upside momentum initiative; UBS sales desk has also observed that the bounces too are shallow. The bank recommends keeping an eye on 1.1380 to the upside (coincides with a short-term downtrend line) and 1.1280 as the major support, and expects consolidation between those levels ahead of Thursday&#39;s ECB meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Swissy has been more reticent to participate in the broader USD rally, with USDCHF confined to a narrow range while the Buck bounces. Despite some seeing the USDCHF as a &#39;cleaner&#39; way to play USD short positions, while the dollar&#39;s trajectory is higher, some suggest that a USDCHF breakout (&#39;catch up effect&#39;) is a risk. Today&#39;s inflation data leant a little to that hypothesis, with the Swissy trading weaker after an in line CPI report (0.4% MM, 0.6% YY). &quot;The franc&rsquo;s appreciation over the course of 2018 is likely to begin having an effect on the inflation rate,&quot; Commerzbank says, &quot;Of course further franc appreciation would be very inconvenient for the SNB, and as a result it is keeping a close eye on developments in connection with Brexit,&quot; which could stoke a haven bid. So the SNB is conducting policy with one eye on external events; Commerz suggests that if the CHF appreciates too sharply, and too much, the SNB will resume intervention in FX with words or even actions. Accordingly, Commerz doesn&#39;t see EURCHF aking ground sub-1.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Some desks have reported buying interest around 111.50 (and supports at the 100 and 200 DMA at 111.30 and 111.40, respectively), with sellers expected to show up around the 112.50 region. the pair moved through the 112.00 level, and breached the 112.08 (76.4% of the 114.55 to 104.10 fall). Above the aforementioned MAs now opens the door to the 2018 high around 114.55, technicians say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>If you needed an instance to demonstrate how much attention GBP traders are paying to politics rather than fundamentals, then this was that day. UK services PMI put in an upside beat in February, and we also had some hawkish-leaning comments from BOE governor Carney, but GBP traded with a negative bias on the headline UK govt is said not to expect any breakthrough at the meeting between UK Attorney General Cox and EU Brexit negotiator Barnier at their meeting today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Ahead of tomorrow&#39;s BOC, CAD was taking its cue from the USD and oil prices, and softened back up to 1.3350. TD Securities says their base case is for a dovish hold, where the BOC reiterates that rates will move to neutral over time, which the bank thinks 1.3325 is the target for CAD; a dovish hold, where it would abandon the reference to higher rates for a neutral stance could open the door to 1.3460, TD says, and in the unlikely event that the BOC cuts rates, a breach of 1.36 could be on the cards. &quot;We expect the BoC will leave the overnight rate unchanged in line with market expectations,&quot; TD says, &quot;the communique is likely to have a dovish tilt to it, as the recent deterioration in economic data ought to outweigh the impact of higher oil prices,&quot; and the bank says the BOC will likely leave its forward looking language mostly unchanged, warning of higher policy rates over time subject to the evolution of the data.&quot; Full RANsquawk preview here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD:</strong> RBA overnight was unchanged, and there was little new info in its policy statement. The Aussie was also being dictated to by events in China (NPC and weak Caixin PMIs), while the US non-manufacturing ISM upside did little for the Antipode. Attention now shifts to Governor Lowe, who will be speaking at a business summit, while traders will also be keeping an eye on the Q4 GDP report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RUB: </strong>The Russian rouble has performed well, of late, supported by Brent prices above 60-64 range, and foreign investors have been scopping up OFZs. Some desks speculated that this could lead the CBR raising its FX purchases later in the month in order to put a lid on further RUB upside. And that is what we saw today, with the Finance Ministry announcing USD 4.7bln of purchases due in March (consensus was USD 3.7bln). &quot;Combined with the backlog from 2H18, total FX purchases in March will reach USD 5.6bln,&quot; ING says. However, ING does not see this as a threat to the RUB in the short-term as a result of the USD 9bln to USD 10bln monthly current account in Q1 of 2019. That said, the bank says mid-term risks are rising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> South African GDP was a mixed bag, with the QQ print missing expectations, while the YY put in an upside surprise. The rand was happy to take the positives, and rallied against the buck (EMFX was generally seeing some upside, on the whole), but South African stocks didn&#39;t share the optimism, while bonds firmed. Nevertheless, some profit-taking was cited in the ZAR with buying interest loining up at the 14.10 level, according to reports. Key level to watch is the 200DMA sub-14.00, analysts said.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US FX WRAP: USD king while forex continues rangebound trade",
        "content": "<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The EUR seems to be lacking any upside momentum initiative; UBS sales desk has also observed that the bounces too are shallow. The bank recommends keeping an eye on 1.1380 to the upside (coincides with a short-term downtrend line) and 1.1280 as the major support, and expects consolidation between those levels ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting.</p><p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Swissy has been more reticent to participate in the broader USD rally, with USDCHF confined to a narrow range while the Buck bounces. Despite some seeing the USDCHF as a 'cleaner' way to play USD short positions, while the dollar's trajectory is higher, some suggest that a USDCHF breakout ('catch up effect') is a risk. Today's inflation data leant a little to that hypothesis, with the Swissy trading weaker after an in line CPI report (0.4% MM, 0.6% YY). \"The franc’s appreciation over the course of 2018 is likely to begin having an effect on the inflation rate,\" Commerzbank says, \"Of course further franc appreciation would be very inconvenient for the SNB, and as a result it is keeping a close eye on developments in connection with Brexit,\" which could stoke a haven bid. So the SNB is conducting policy with one eye on external events; Commerz suggests that if the CHF appreciates too sharply, and too much, the SNB will resume intervention in FX with words or even actions. Accordingly, Commerz doesn't see EURCHF aking ground sub-1.10.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Some desks have reported buying interest around 111.50 (and supports at the 100 and 200 DMA at 111.30 and 111.40, respectively), with sellers expected to show up around the 112.50 region. the pair moved through the 112.00 level, and breached the 112.08 (76.4% of the 114.55 to 104.10 fall). Above the aforementioned MAs now opens the door to the 2018 high around 114.55, technicians say.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>If you needed an instance to demonstrate how much attention GBP traders are paying to politics rather than fundamentals, then this was that day. UK services PMI put in an upside beat in February, and we also had some hawkish-leaning comments from BOE governor Carney, but GBP traded with a negative bias on the headline UK govt is said not to expect any breakthrough at the meeting between UK Attorney General Cox and EU Brexit negotiator Barnier at their meeting today.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Ahead of tomorrow's BOC, CAD was taking its cue from the USD and oil prices, and softened back up to 1.3350. TD Securities says their base case is for a dovish hold, where the BOC reiterates that rates will move to neutral over time, which the bank thinks 1.3325 is the target for CAD; a dovish hold, where it would abandon the reference to higher rates for a neutral stance could open the door to 1.3460, TD says, and in the unlikely event that the BOC cuts rates, a breach of 1.36 could be on the cards. \"We expect the BoC will leave the overnight rate unchanged in line with market expectations,\" TD says, \"the communique is likely to have a dovish tilt to it, as the recent deterioration in economic data ought to outweigh the impact of higher oil prices,\" and the bank says the BOC will likely leave its forward looking language mostly unchanged, warning of higher policy rates over time subject to the evolution of the data.\" <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21308/download\">RANsquawk preview here.</a></p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>RBA overnight was unchanged, and there was little new info in its policy statement. The Aussie was also being dictated to by events in China (NPC and weak Caixin PMIs), while the US non-manufacturing ISM upside did little for the Antipode. Attention now shifts to Governor Lowe, who will be speaking at a business summit, while traders will also be keeping an eye on the Q4 GDP report.</p><p><strong>* RUB: </strong>The Russian rouble has performed well, of late, supported by Brent prices above 60-64 range, and foreign investors have been scopping up OFZs. Some desks speculated that this could lead the CBR raising its FX purchases later in the month in order to put a lid on further RUB upside. And that is what we saw today, with the Finance Ministry announcing USD 4.7bln of purchases due in March (consensus was USD 3.7bln). \"Combined with the backlog from 2H18, total FX purchases in March will reach USD 5.6bln,\" ING says. However, ING does not see this as a threat to the RUB in the short-term as a result of the USD 9bln to USD 10bln monthly current account in Q1 of 2019. That said, the bank says mid-term risks are rising.</p><p><strong>* ZAR: </strong>South African GDP was a mixed bag, with the QQ print missing expectations, while the YY put in an upside surprise. The rand was happy to take the positives, and rallied against the buck (EMFX was generally seeing some upside, on the whole), but South African stocks didn't share the optimism, while bonds firmed. Nevertheless, some profit-taking was cited in the ZAR with buying interest lining up at the 14.10 level, according to reports. Key level to watch is the 200DMA sub-14.00, analysts said.</p><p><strong>* MXN: </strong>Data showed Mexican consumer confidence rising for a third straight month to a record high in February, helping the MXN gain against the USD (DXY was up in the session). The data will provide some comfort to the new Administration who have been warned by rating agencies. For now this will put less pressure on the Banxico to pivot dovish; the central bank has been acting against high inflation, though as this eases and the data slate becomes softer, some have argued that the case for policy easing was becoming prominent (the latest Banxico survey of private sector expectations has seen lower estimates for both growth and inflation, for instance). Capital Economics has said that the Banxico's concerns on inflation, specifically core inflation, are somewhat overdone, noting that weaker food inflation over the coming quarters should push down core price pressure, and therefore, sees the easing cycle beginning in Q3 of this year, and the consultancy sees the Banciso cutting rates to 7.50% by year-end (from 8.25%).</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude prices were mixed on Tuesday, where a slew of positive PMI data from Europe heightened risk appetite. However, prices pared back gains after the US equity open, where a recent trend has developed of equities selling off just as Europeans begin leaving their desks. Alongside the equity sell off, a strong ISM non-mfg headline figure saw a spike in the dollar, further leading to negative ticks in oil prices. On the supply side of the equation, Libya&rsquo;s El Sharara oilfield production increased to 80k BPD from 30k BPD yesterday after the force majeure was lifted. The Venezuelan, state-owned PDVSA&#39;s Isla refinery (335k BPD) is reported to stay shut through 2019 due to sanctions. The market is looking ahead to tonight&rsquo;s APIs to gauge energy inventories ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s official DOE release, following last week&rsquo;s extreme crude stock draw of over 8mln bbls. Crude stocks are seen building by 1.2mln bbls, distillates drawing 1.4mln bbls and gasoline drawing 2.1mln bbls; Genscape forecasts the key Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub building 373k bbls. This Friday the CFTC will release its COT data, which will finally be up to date following the US shutdown, although data has been laggard for WTI, &nbsp;analysts at PVM note an &ldquo;obvious trend&rdquo; of how money managers have been favouring Brent in comparison to WTI recently, despite WTI&rsquo;s recent rise, where &ldquo;Brent speculators have added 130 million bbls to their net exposure this year whilst WTI financial investors have cut their net speculative length by 12mln bbls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>It was a mixed bag for the February non-manufacturing ISM, with the headline beating, though there was some disappointment with the sub-indices. Pantheon Macroeconomics says the data were previously impacted by the government shutdown as well as the stock slide in Q4, and therefore, a rebound was likely. \"The reported plunge in December retail sales might have made some forecasters hold back, but we don’t believe the numbers and we expect them to be revised up substantially,\" Pantheon says, \"the ISM data support our view that the much stronger Redbook chainstore sales numbers more accurately reflect the strength of spending over the holidays,\" and \"sales growth is now slowing, though, as the boost from the tax cuts and the drop in gas prices fades, so further sustained gains in the ISM non-manufacturing headline are unlikely.\" Ahead of Friday's NFP data, there was also some attention on the employment component, which slipped by over two points to 55.2. Pantheon still thinks that is solid, but i sugests that labour demand is now running at a 200k monthly clip vs the 250k+ that was signalled last summer/fall. \"Labor supply could not keep up with demand at that pace, so the slowing in demand now, as the tax cuts fade, does not necessarily mean that payroll growth will materially soften,\" Pantheon says, \"For now, though, what matters is the the strong-looking headline, which should help offset some of the fears triggered by the aggressive manufacturing downshift.\"</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/f67fee0b-c314-4b22-b1c1-912642204acb.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has lost even more of its recent bullish Brexit premium as rising hopes of support for PM May’s Withdrawal Agreement fade further amidst reports that latest negotiations in Brussels will not produce the assurances needed to convince doubters and opposers to back the deal when it goes before Parliament again. In fact, even the UK Government is not anticipating a breakthrough when AG Cox meets EU’s Barnier, although there will be detailed negotiations about potential changes to the current backstop proposal. Cable took out another series of downside technical ‘supports’, like the 10 DMA and a Fib on its way through another big figure at 1.1300, but held just above a late February low and then retested the aforementioned 1.3130 Fib as the Usd lost some momentum around 97.000 in <strong>DXY </strong>terms. Meanwhile, <strong>EUR</strong>/Gbp rebounded to just shy of 0.8650 from 0.8585 at one stage, as the single currency remained a bit more resilient on the back of above forecast and/or flash Eurozone PMIs, and an unexpected (but welcome) upward revision to final Italian Q4 GDP. However, Eur/Usd eventually lost grip of 1.1300 handle and is becoming increasingly vulnerable from a chart perspective while under 1.1350.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The other major laggards after the overnight miss in China’s Caixin services PMI and the NPC’s official growth downgrade, with the Kiwi extending losses vs its US counterpart below 0.6800 to 0.6775 and the Loonie unable to stem the tide from 1.3350+ vs the Usd for long as Canadian-Chinese tensions were underlined by the blocking of Canola imports by Beijing. Back to Nzd/Usd, the latest GDT auction results may provide some independent direction, but for the record the event has not been an NZ driver for a while.</p><p><strong>CHF/AUD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All ending Tuesday’s EU session on the backfoot vs the Buck that derived extra traction from an upbeat US non-manufacturing ISM survey to nudge the index incrementally over the next round number as noted above. Usd/Chf rebounded further above 1.0000 to 1.0040 and Aud/Usd got very close to hefty 1.6 bn option expiries at 0.7050, while Usd/Jpy seems to have cleared 112.00 resistance and psychological offers more convincingly to test a Fib just above.</p><p><strong>SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A rare if note sole G10 winner, albeit vs the Eur as Sweden’s services PMI surprised to the upside and helped pull the cross back under 10.6000 to 10.5450 at one stage.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Off best levels, but the index continues to edge higher and just surpassed another chart resistance level (96.784) ahead of the next big figure on its way to a 96.815 high. The Greenback is still benefiting from weakness in rival currencies to an extent if not large part, or by default as a combination of negative/bearish factors inflict damage elsewhere (ranging from weaker macro fundamentals relative to the US, geopolitical instability/uncertainty and Central Bank policies aligning to Fed patience or even turning more dovish in certain cases, to name just a few). The DXY is now holding around 96.750 and well above Monday’s 96.331 low.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The 2 biggest G10 losers, with the Kiwi slipping below 0.6800 amidst a broader fall-out in risk currencies following a considerably weaker than forecast Chinese Caixin services PMI and confirmation that the NPC has downgraded its GDP sights to 6-6.5% from 6.5% previously. Meanwhile, the Loonie has extended recent losses to fresh multi-month lows circa 1.3350 vs its US counterpart with the added weight of heightened strains between Canada and China, plus another downturn in crude prices.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Also weaker vs Usd, as the single currency fails to derive much/any real support from surprise beats and upward tweaks to the Eurozone services PMIs, including the Italian headline that rebounded over 50.0 and was supplemented by an unexpected Q4 GDP revision to -0.1% q/q from -0.2%. Eur/Usd is hovering just above yesterday’s 1.1309 base and Fib support at 1.1305, but looks technically weak after breaching 1.1350 and key chart levels not far above. Similarly, the Aussie is struggling to mount a concerted recovery from recent lows towards 0.7100 after a dovish RBA policy statement on balance and yet more poor data overnight (Q4 net exports), and Aud/Usd could become increasingly drawn to a hefty option expiry down at 0.7050 as a result (1.6 bn). Meanwhile, the Yen and Franc continue to trade defensively on constructive US-China trade deal vibes, with Usd/Jpy edging back up to 112.00 and Usd/Chf straddling parity. Note also, decent option expiries in Usd/Jpy may impact into the NY cut, with 1 bn running off between 111.80-90 and 1.9 bn at the 112.00 strike.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Relative outperformers on better than expected UK and Swedish services PMIs vs other more downbeat economic indicators. However, Cable remains capped ahead of 1.3200 and the 100 WMA (1.3207), with the 10 DMA (1.3161) and a Fib (1.3130) now flanking the pair as it pivots 1.3150 awaiting any further Brexit developments. Eur/Sek has retreated through 10.6000 again and retesting bids around 10.5500.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>More angst for the Try and Inr after the US pulled the GSP plug from both nations, with the Lira attempting to pare losses and stay above 5.4000, but the Rupee staging a firmer recovery from almost 71.0000 at one stage as India’s Trade Ministry downplayed the impact of the trade pact being terminated.</p>",

However, the rebound in Italian debt futures is also compelling as BTPs gleaned additional support from an unexpected upward tweak to Q4 GDP, a deal with the EU to extend guarantees for NPLs and a warning that the 5-Star party could quit the coalition over the Turin-Lyon rail link, thereby potentially removing a more contentious element from Government. Bunds now just off a new 165.26 low (-33 ticks on the day), BTPs not far from 128.86 at best (+44 ticks) and Gilts also seeing more retracement to 125.90 (-13 ticks) just ahead of the UK services PMI.</p>",

Back to Liffe, and the 10 year benchmark has been choppy either side of parity between 126.06-125.95, with 3 month contracts even more confined and only venturing 0.5 tick around the unchanged line, thus far. However, the upcoming services PMI has the potential to spark more price movement as the consensus is for contraction in the key sector along the lines of the construction outcome yesterday. Also ahead, FPC minutes and BoE Governor Carney at the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, but anything material emanating from the latest Brexit talks will of course be paramount.</p>",

As such EUR/USD languished further below the 1.1350 level whilst GBP/USD gave up more ground below its 100 WMA at 1.3207 before finding support at 1.3150. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was knocked lower after the China Caixin Services release showed that the measure for backlogs of work contracted for the second consecutive month, hitting its lowest level since February 2016 and in turn, reflecting downward pressure on overall orders. AUD/USD fell further below the 0.7100 and took the NZD down in sympathy. The Aussie experienced volatility at the release of the RBA statement but ultimately stabilised around pre-release levels as traders noted that the overall picture drawn by the Central Bank was little changed. In the EM FX space, TRY initially weakened on the back of reports that US President Trump is to drop Turkey&rsquo;s long-standing preferential status when trading with the US against the backstop of strained relations between the US President and his Turkish counterpart. Furthermore, INR opened weaker amid Trump&rsquo;s Generalised System of Preferences termination, but then pared losses after an Indian Trade Ministry official downplayed the consequences of deal ending. Finally, since February 25, Morgan Stanley positioning has shifted and within G10, the largest shorts are now in the CAD and CHF, whilst there are no significant longs, but JPY remains closest to long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RBA left its Cash Rate unchanged at 1.50% as expected. The statement which followed was digested as being relatively mixed but the last paragraph (often looked to as the most important) was unchanged. The statement noted that the slower pace of domestic growth has continued into 2019 whilst acknowledging the outlook for global growth remains a source of uncertainty and downside risks have increased. RBA said inflation remains low and stable and underlying inflation is expected to pick up over the next couple of years, with the pick-up likely to be gradual and to take a little longer than earlier expected. However, it highlighted that low level of interest rates continues to support the Australian economy and further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Current Account Balance SA Q4 -7.2B vs. Exp. -9.2B (Prev. -10.7B, Rev. -10.8B) (Newswires)<br />Australian Net Exports Contribution Q4 -0.2% vs. Exp. -0.1% (Prev. 0.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures were lower during Asia-Pac trade as the energy complex conformed to the risk tone, rising Dollar and disappointing Chinese data. WTI futures stabilised below USD 56.50/bbl while the global benchmark lost the USD 65.50/bbl level in early trade. In terms of metals, spot gold steadied near 5-week lows despite a rising greenback amid the risk averse mood, whilst Shanghai base metal futures fell after China lowered its GDP growth target to 6.0-6.5% from &ldquo;around 6.5%&rdquo;. Thus, Shanghai nickel retreated from 5-month highs despite a decline in stocks and Shanghai copper fell as much as 1.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s NOC said it has lifted the force majeure at the El Sharara oilfield (300k BPD); production has resumed at 30K BPD but is expected to reach 80K BPD in one day; according to sources.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks trade lacklustre following a disappointing lead from Wall Street after the Dow slipped 0.8%, weighed on by Boeing and Goldman Sachs shares, whilst the S&amp;P shed 0.4% amid underperformance in healthcare names. Both indices marked their worst turnaround since early February. ASX 200 (-0.7%) extended losses from the open amid underperformance in the Consumer Discretionary and Material sectors, whilst Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) is weighed on by commodity exposed stocks. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) nursed some opening losses following the release of the NPC work report which pledged to expand infrastructure investments and cut manufacturing VAT to 13% from 16%, whilst transports and constructions VAT is to be reduced to 9% from 10%, although the release of dismal Caixin services PMI briefly dented the index. Finally, Hang Seng (-0.6%) has conformed to the overall risk-averse tone with its heavy-weight Financials sector as the marked underperformer.</p><p>In FX markets, the Dollar index stabilised after recouping recent losses as investors side-lined US President Trump’s verbal intervention. As such EUR/USD languished below the 1.1350 level whilst GBP/USD failed to nurse recent losses after falling below its 100 WMA at 1.3207. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was knocked lower after the China Caixin Services release showed that the measure for backlogs of work contracted for the second consecutive month, hitting its lowest level since February 2016 and in turn, reflecting downward pressure on overall orders. AUD/USD fell further below the 0.7100 and took the Kiwi down in sympathy ahead of the RBA rate decision. In the EM FX space, TRY initially weakened after reports that US President Trump is to drop Turkey’s long-standing preferential status when trading with the US against the backstop of strained relations between the US President and his Turkish counterpart.</p>",
