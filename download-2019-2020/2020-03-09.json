US futures hit the level 1 (-5%) limit down, banning any transaction below that until the cash open, where within a few minutes of reopening, hit their level 2 (7%) limit down, banning all trade for fifteen minutes, then reopened and soon bounced off their lows, albeit still deeply in the red. Stocks over in Europe had it even harder, Euro Stoxx 50 closed lower by over 8%, with the FTSE MIB down over 11% - futures extended loses. Energy and Financials continued to drag the indices lower as the survivability of shale names, particularly their credit requirements, were further put into question by investors – the Treasury curve bull-flattening to bring all yields beneath 1% was reflective of falling energy prices as well as self-reinforcing to weakness in banks. Participants are also increasingly expecting global fiscal action in face of the virus, where G7 governments have asserted their readiness to support their economies as need be, although nothing concrete has yet been announced in the UK, US and Germany, any shortfall in the eyes of investors will likely deepen the market damage. The Energy sector (XLE, XOP, FANG, APA) was generally offered heavily amid the obliteration of oil prices – although names exposed highly to nat gas fared better (COG, EQT) as the expected decline in drilling activity will be bullish for gas. Continued yield declines, risk aversion and credit concerns, particularly in the energy sector, weighed on financials (XLF, BKX), particularly regional banks (KRE), and even further those with acute loan exposure to US shale oil (BKOF, CMA, CADE). Cruise liners (CCL, RCL, NCLH) found no selling reprieve as US imposed stricter restrictions on trips. Twitter (TWTR) was one of the handful of names in the green after it announced a USD 2bln share repurchase programme while it reached a deal with Silver Lake and Elliott management, who will both get a seat on the board and funding for the share repurchase programme; there was no mention of the removal of CEO Dorsey. Tesla (TSLA) was hit hard by wider risk aversion, despite positive comments from a top shareholder doing the rounds. Apple (AAPL) moved lower with the market alongside reports of a sharp Y/Y decline in its February iPhone sales in China. Aon (AON) were hit after it agreed to purchase Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) for USD 30bln, creating an USD 80bln entity. SPX -7.61% at 2746, NDX -6.83% at 7948, DJI -7.79% at 23,849.</p><p>The chunky bid extended on Monday amid the risk aversion and oil price collapse. The curve exhibited further bull flattening alongside weaker inflation expectations and corporate credit concerns as oil prices tumbled further towards their all-time lows, equities were also hit strongly. In the overnight session the 30-year bond was bid as much as six points, with desks noting nobody on the other side of the trade. The rally saw all yields move beneath the 1% figure for the first time in history, and participants now move to the question of when the Fed will cut again rather than if. By settlement, 2-year yield had fallen 21bps while the 30-year had fallen by 38bps to 0.840%, but above its lows of 0.702%. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point 8 ticks higher at 139.09+.</p>",

US futures hit the level 1 (-5%) limit down, banning any transaction below that until the cash open, where within a few minutes of reopening, hit their level 2 (7%) limit down, banning all trade for fifteen minutes, then reopened and soon bounced off their lows, albeit still deeply in the red. Stocks over in Europe had it even harder, Euro Stoxx 50 closed lower by over 8%, with the FTSE MIB down over 11% - futures extended loses. Energy and Financials continued to drag the indices lower as the survivability of shale names, particularly their credit requirements, were further put into question by investors – the Treasury curve bull-flattening to bring all yields beneath 1% was reflective of falling energy prices as well as self-reinforcing to weakness in banks. Participants are also increasingly expecting global fiscal action in face of the virus, where G7 governments have asserted their readiness to support their economies as need be, although nothing concrete has yet been announced in the UK, US and Germany, any shortfall in the eyes of investors will likely deepen the market damage.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD LOWER AT USD /BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD LOWER AT USD /BBL: </strong>Energy markets exhibited their largest price declines since the Iraq Gulf war amid the OPEC breakdown. Sources over the weekend noted that Saudi Arabia will be boosting its output to above 10mln BPD from this month’s 9.7mln BPD as a response to the collapse of its OPEC+ alliance with Russia. Saudi is also said to have told market participants that it could raise output to as much as 12mln BPD, although sources stated that the initial increase is likely to total between 10-11mln BPD in April, with the final figure contingent on refiners’ response to price cuts. Furthermore, the Kingdom slashed its official pricing for crude, with oil giant Aramco cutting its Asia prices for Arab Light crude and Medium crude by USD 6/bbl each, to discounts of USD 3.10/bbl and USD 4.05/bbl below the Middle East benchmark respectively. In a challenge to Russia, the company made the largest cut to northwest Europe of some USD 8/bbl in most grades – Russia sells a bulk of its Urals crude in the same region. Arab Light sales to Europe will be at a USD 10.25/bbl discount to Brent – levels not seen since at least May 2002. As a result of the anticipated rising production and slash in OSPs – expected to flood the market with barrels – WTI and Brent futures sank 27% and 30% respectively, with the former paused for a few minutes following its aggressive >7% move. WTI Apr’20 briefly slipped below USD 28/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 41.50/bbl close, while Brent May 20 dipping south of USD 32/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 45.50/close – with the spread also narrowing to ~USD 3.80/bbl vs. ~4/bbl on Friday. The Kingdom hopes the slump in oil prices and the expected diminishing in Russia’s market shares will prompt Moscow back to the negotiating table and force its hand to cut output. Desks note that although this may prove effective in the short-term, it is in less certain what the longer-term impact will be. In the meantime, investors are now cautious on US shale producers, as concerns grow over their ability to continue producing at such low prices and their ability to refinance their debt obligations, especially given recent widening of credit spreads.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19: </strong>Cases continued to rise outside China, with WHO’s Tedros stating the threat of a pandemic has become very real although “it can still be controlled”. The economic impact continues to seep into the economy while further actions are being taken to help soften the blow. Japan’s MOF’s Takeuchi stated they will respond to excess volatility as appropriate and will pay closer attention to market moves with a sense of urgency. Meanwhile the BoJ purchased JPY 101.4bln worth of ETF’s, the third time this month. Elsewhere multiple reports have suggested the US are discussing a number of options to support the economy which includes, paid sick leave, cashflow injection for small businesses and a tax deferral on specific industries, such as hospitality and travel; a meeting on the matter is expected this afternoon. However, CNBC reported virus ideas were “kicked around” over the weekend but there is nothing on paper and it is still a long way off. In the UK, PM Johnson reiterated the government and Bank of England will take all steps necessary on the coronavirus, while noting the UK remains in the contain phase but has accepted the virus will spready in a significant way. In Europe, German Chancellor Merkel’s government loosened rules for short-term work compensation, making it easier for companies impacted by the coronavirus to apply for aid; government is set to invest a further EUR 12.1bln per annum between 2021 and 2024. Italy's Deputy Economy Minister stated the government and Bank of Italy are looking into a guarantee scheme, to support banks offering moratorium to households and companies following the virus outbreak and is reportedly considering extending tax moratorium as well. Meanwhile, French Finance Minister Le Maire stated the ECB has room for manoeuvre and European Finance Ministers need to come to an economic stimulus plan for the coronavirus, which needs to contain both budgetary and fiscal measures. Also, EZ Finance Ministers have raised the possibility with banks supervisors of giving firms struggling with virus impact more time that the usual 90 days before their debt is classified as non-performing loans.</p><p><strong>* CASE UPDATE: </strong>US CDC announced 472 total confirmed and presumptive cases, including repatriated cases, as of 4pm on Sunday, with the death toll rising by 8 to 19. UK cases rose to 319 (prev. 273), with the death toll rising by 2 to 5. Italy death toll rose to 463 from 366; total cases rose to 9172 from 7375. Canada reported its first death.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>China’s trade balance for January and February saw a USD 7bln deficit, against expectations of a USD 24.6bln surplus, falling from the previous USD 47.2bln surplus. Both imports and exports declined, although the deficit was triggered by a massive 17.2% decline in exports, a deeper decline than the expected 14%, meanwhile imports declined less than expected, only falling 4% compared to an expected 15% decline. The data includes two months of data given the extended lunar new year holiday and coronavirus, the first month of data tends to see volatile data even without the extension. Analysts at UBS note that trade activity in China could return to normality by the end of this month or in early Q2.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Last night, the South Korean military announced North Korea fired short range projectiles as part of ongoing drills. The missiles flew 200km and saw an altitude of 50km and Japan noted the launches were likely ballistic missiles. South Korea and Kapan were both displeased with the missile launches as it violates an agreement at lowering military animosities, although none of the launches landed within the Exclusive Economic Zone. Elsewhere in Libya, Eastern Commander Haftar reportedly agreed to signing a ceasefire deal with France’s President Macron, although noted the ceasefire would not be kept if Tripoli militias ignored it. On Iran, US President Trump’s administration will reportedly soon issue an advisory warning to anyone holding Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions and will soon issue a maritime advisory to target ships that turn off transponders to avoid sanctions.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 1 POINT 8 TICKS HIGHER AT 139.09+. </strong>The chunky bid extended on Monday amid the risk aversion and oil price collapse. The curve exhibited further bull flattening alongside weaker inflation expectations and corporate credit concerns as oil prices tumbled further towards their all-time lows, equities were also hit strongly. In the overnight session the 30-year bond was bid as much as six points, with desks noting nobody on the other side of the trade. The rally saw all yields move beneath the 1% figure for the first time in history, and participants now move to the question of when the Fed will cut again rather than if. By settlement, 2-year yield had fallen 21bps while the 30-year had fallen by 38bps to 0.840%, but above its lows of 0.702%.</p><p><strong>* REPO:</strong> The NY Fed stepped in (somewhat) unexpectedly on Monday, raising its o/n repo operations to USD 150bln (prev. 100bln) and the Terms raised to USD 45bln (prev. 20bln); coming amid recent and expected funding pressures, and walking back on its original plan to gradually wind down its presence in the repo market. The Fed line is that it would reassess its role in the funding markets after the April 15th corporate tax date.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -7.61% at 2746, NDX -6.83% at 7948, DJI -7.79% at 23,849; <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy-20%, Financials -11%, Materials -9.2%, Industrials -9.2%, Technology -7.56%, Real Estate -7.15%, Communication Svs. -6.2%, Consumer Discretionary -6.2%, Utilities -5.6%, Health Care -5.2% and Consumer Staples -4.4%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>The Energy sector (XLE, XOP, FANG, APA) was generally offered heavily amid the obliteration of oil prices – although names exposed highly to nat gas fared better (COG, EQT) as the expected decline in drilling activity will be bullish for gas. Continued yield declines, risk aversion and credit concerns, particularly in the energy sector, weighed on financials (XLF, BKX), particularly regional banks (KRE), and even further those with acute loan exposure to US shale oil (BKOF, CMA, CADE). Cruise liners (CCL, RCL, NCLH) found no selling reprieve as US imposed stricter restrictions on trips. Twitter (TWTR) was one of the handful of names in the green after it announced a USD 2bln share repurchase programme while it reached a deal with Silver Lake and Elliott management, who will both get a seat on the board and funding for the share repurchase programme; there was no mention of the removal of CEO Dorsey. Tesla (TSLA) was hit hard by wider risk aversion, despite positive comments from a top shareholder doing the rounds. Apple (AAPL) moved lower with the market alongside reports of a sharp Y/Y decline in its February iPhone sales in China. Aon (AON) were hit after it agreed to purchase Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) for USD 30bln, creating an USD 80bln entity.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> was offered and DXY printed a low of 94.632, a level not seen since September 2018, as participants flocked to safety while yields fell beneath 1% across the curve and market pricing for deeper rate cuts from the Fed continued to increase, where markets are currently pricing in over 75bps worth of easing at the upcoming March meeting. The flight to quality saw <strong>CHF</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong> firmer with EURCHF beneath the key 1.06 level while USDJPY traded as low as 101.20 before calming around the 102 figure, the appreciation in both CHF and JPY has spurred chatter of potential Central Bank intervention from both nations. <strong>XAU</strong> however failed to maintain its benefit from the haven bid although the precious metal remains around recent highs of USD 1675 heading into the final few minutes of trade after breaking above USD 1700 last night. <strong>EUR &amp; GBP</strong> both fared better against the buck given the heavy sell off in the greenback, although the latter facing key event risk with the budget on Wednesday. Antipodes succumbed to the broader risk appetite and both sold off against the dollar, although AUDUSD came out as the clear antipodean underperformer and saw lows at 0.6323, meanwhile NZDUSD traded within 0.6158-0.6448 parameters, with much of the rebound in morning trade ahead of manufacturing sales tonight. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker across the board given risk appetite although USDRUB traded over 8% higher given the heavy sell off in oil prices, which also hurt MXN, meanwhile TRY a relative underperformer (USDTRY -1%) as its exposure to lower oil prices is much less given it is a net importer.</p>",

The curve exhibited further bull flattening alongside weaker inflation expectations and corporate credit concerns as oil prices tumbled further towards their all-time lows, equities were also hit strongly. In the overnight session the 30-year bond was bid as much as six points, with desks noting nobody on the other side of the trade. The rally saw all yields move beneath the 1% figure for the first time in history, and participants now move to the question of when the Fed will cut again rather than if. By settlement, 2-year yield had fallen 21bps while the 30-year had fallen by 38bps to 0.840%, but above its lows of 0.702%.</li><li>REPO: The NY Fed stepped in (somewhat) unexpectedly on Monday, raising its o/n repo operations to USD 150bln (prev. 100bln) and the Terms raised to USD 45bln (prev. 20bln); coming amid recent and expected funding pressures, and walking back on its original plan to gradually wind down its presence in the repo market. The Fed line is that it would reassess its role in the funding markets after the April 15th corporate tax date.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Energy markets exhibited their largest price declines since the Iraq Gulf war amid the OPEC breakdown. Sources over the weekend noted that Saudi Arabia will be boosting its output to above 10mln BPD from this month’s 9.7mln BPD as a response to the collapse of its OPEC+ alliance with Russia. Saudi is also said to have told market participants that it could raise output to as much as 12mln BPD, although sources stated that the initial increase is likely to total between 10-11mln BPD in April, with the final figure contingent on refiners’ response to price cuts. Furthermore, the Kingdom slashed its official pricing for crude, with oil giant Aramco cutting its Asia prices for Arab Light crude and Medium crude by USD 6/bbl each, to discounts of USD 3.10/bbl and USD 4.05/bbl below the Middle East benchmark respectively. In a challenge to Russia, the company made the largest cut to northwest Europe of some USD 8/bbl in most grades – Russia sells a bulk of its Urals crude in the same region. Arab Light sales to Europe will be at a USD 10.25/bbl discount to Brent – levels not seen since at least May 2002. As a result of the anticipated rising production and slash in OSPs – expected to flood the market with barrels – WTI and Brent futures sank 27% and 30% respectively, with the former paused for a few minutes following its aggressive &gt;7% move. WTI Apr’20 briefly slipped below USD 28/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 41.50/bbl close, while Brent May 20 dipping south of USD 32/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 45.50/close – with the spread also narrowing to ~USD 3.80/bbl vs. ~4/bbl on Friday. The Kingdom hopes the slump in oil prices and the expected diminishing in Russia’s market shares will prompt Moscow back to the negotiating table and force its hand to cut output. Desks note that although this may prove effective in the short-term, it is in less certain what the longer-term impact will be. In the meantime, investors are now cautious on US shale producers, as concerns grow over their ability to continue producing at such low prices and their ability to refinance their debt obligations, especially given recent widening of credit spreads.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains weak overall and only retaining gains over the petro-currencies plus EM counterparts as markets continue to factor in more aggressive Fed easing as soon as if not before the March FOMC. Indeed, despite last Tuesday’s shock 50 bp emergency rate cut, US Treasury yields have sunk further, and the curve is even flatter as all benchmark maturities trade under 1%. China’s coronavirus is still claiming more lives and spreading across the globe, but the latest issue for investors to fret about is an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia after the latter refused to join OPEC+ in bigger crude output cuts last Friday. In response, the Kingdom has cut OSPs and announced production hikes from next month in an effort to gain market share and put pressure on Russia, while Rosneft has also signalled intentions to up output from April. WTI and Brent are well off worst levels of just over Usd27 and Usd31 per barrel respectively, but still deep underwater as the <strong>DXY</strong> clings to the 95.000 level.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/NZD/GBP/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Yen is still flying the flag for safe havens and outperforming bullion even though Usd/Jpy saw a sharp rebound from new multi-year lows closer to 101.00 after Wall Street reopened and key indices hit limit down circuit breaks (-7%) to trigger a 15 minute trade suspension. US and EU equities remain sharply lower and sentiment is very fragile, so the aforementioned bounce in Usd/Jpy to 102.50+ at one stage seemed to be fabricated on firm underlying bids, if not officially instigated. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd is holding towards the upper end of a near 1.1500-1.1285 range as the single currency benefits from the Greenback’s demise and its semi safety status rather than worrying unduly about a bleak Eurozone Sentix survey or the mounting nCoV toll in Italy, France and Germany etc. However, the Kiwi’s revival from overnight trough to peak (0.6148-0.6448) is arguably more notable ahead of NZ manufacturing sales and the Aussie is tagging along (0.6323-0.6685) on relative yield differentials and having regained some poise after a flash crash alongside its Antipodean peer. Meanwhile, the Franc and Pound are meandering into Monday’s EU ‘close’ awaiting the SNB and BoE March policy meetings, with the former also conscious of this week’s UK Budget as Cable hovers around 1.3100 and Usd/Chf near 0.9300.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All ruffled by the latest bout of risk aversion and collapse in crude noted above, as the Loonie extends post-BOC ease declines within 1.3463-1.3759 extremes, Eur/Nok holds above 10.8000, albeit off a fresh ATH fractions shy of 11.0000 and Eur/Sek sits a few pips over 10.7500.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Several regional Central Banks and regulators have been intervening to stop or curb currency depreciation caused by waves of capital flight, not to mention declines suffered on underlying commodities, including the BCB and BI. However, record lows have been recorded across the region regardless of data or more specific factors, like mixed Mexican inflation metrics and a firmer than forecast Brazilian IGP-DI price index. Nevertheless, some solace for the Try via lower oil prices and the positive fiscal impact.</p>",

In a challenge to Russia, the company made the largest cut to northwest Europe of some USD 8/bbl in most grades – Russia sells a bulk of its Urals crude in the same region. Finally, Arab Light sales to Europe will be at a USD 10.25/bbl discount to Brent – levels not seen since at least May 2002.</li><li>Note, after OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement Russia's energy minister Novak stated from April 1st, they will not be bound to any restrictions, although at the time Novak stated it had no plans of increasing output, but this has seemingly changed given weekend events.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

It’s worth noting that sentiment has begun to recuperate somewhat, with US equity futures trading briefly above the limit down positions that were hit overnight <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/circuit-breakers-7-13-and-20-circuit-breakers-in-us-cash-equities-were-established-in-wake-of-the-1987-black-monday-crash-09-03-2020\">(Limit Down Details).</a> Given the commitments from Saudi to increase production to over 10.0mln BPD as of next month and they have cut the official selling price for all destinations by around USD 7/bbl, crude prices are as such lower by over USD 10/bbl and the energy sector has similarly recoiled <strong>(Stoxx Oil &amp; Gas -13%).</strong> The Oil &amp; Gas Sector accounts for 5.5% of the Stoxx 500 itself, and the largest weightings withing the sector are Total at 29.4%, BP with 15.5% and Shell contributing 14.5%; in terms of price performance, they are currently down by 13.3%, 15.7% and 16.7% respectively. Additionally, the overall downside is exacerbated by the FTQ seen overnight which has sent the global yield complex to record lows for most core parties. For instance, the entirety of the US yield curve is below 1% for the first time and the German 10yr low thus far resides at -0.86%. The <strong>Stoxx banking sector</strong> is the sector with the 3rd largest weighting in the Stoxx 600 representing 9.4% and is currently 7.3% down on the day. Elsewhere, sectors are all firmly in the red as is every open component in the Stoxx 600 itself; note, a number of Co’s failed, at least initially, to open. Looking ahead, focus turns to how markets react to the US’ entrance, particularly whether this exacerbates the sell-off; as well as for any indicative signs from any particular Co’s in the Energy/Banking sector regarding profit warnings, guidance changes or other telling comments.</p><p><strong>Circuit Breakers:</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>: During non-US trading hours <strong>(Futures) </strong>– Hard upside or downside limit of 5% from 1800EST/2200GMT to 0930EST/1330GMT.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Midpoint of the limit is based on the futures fixing price</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Width of limit is based on index value at 1600EST/2000GMT</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>: During US trading hours <strong>(Cash)</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7% fall to 2764.30 before 15:25EST/19:25GMT will prompt a 15-minute pause.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13% drop before said time to 2585.96 will introduce another 15-minute pause.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fall of 20% within the time will shut the markets; only the 20% rule applies to the final 35 minutes of trading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NASDAQ</strong>: Nasdaq <strong>futures</strong> will stop falling if the contract reaches 8093.25.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>DOW JONES:</strong> DJ <strong>futures</strong> will stop falling if the contract trades below 24534</p><p><strong>Apple (AAPL) -</strong> 5G iPhone release may be pushed-back to October, which would be a delay of 1-month, due to the coronavirus, according to Global Times Business Source. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/RUB/CAD/AUD/NZD - </strong>Risk sentiment has been roiled by Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase output and slash the cost of crude in response to the breakdown of OPEC+ talks last week when Russia refused to back a deeper cut in production, as prices tumble and compound fears over the economic fallout from China’s nCoV. Eur/Nok has hit highs just shy of 11.0000 and Eur/Sek topped 10.7500, while Usd/Rub peered over 75.0000 before WTI and Brent nursed some losses from just above Usd27 and Usd31 per barrel respectively. Meanwhile, Usd/Cad catapulted to 1.3750+ at one stage overnight and the Antipodean Dollars saw flash crashes that dragged Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd down to circa 0.6320 and 0.6030, but the Loonie, Aussie and Kiwi have all clawed back some lost ground as their US peer succumbs to pressure from sliding Treasury yields and more pronounced bull-flattening along the curve, not to mention heavy depreciation vs safer havens.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/GBP - </strong>In stark contrast to all the above, Usd/Jpy has been trading largely in lock-step with oil with added impetus from risk-off flows/positioning between wide 104.58-101.58 parameters and the Yen retains a strong underlying bid unlike GOLD that has faded from a few bucks over Usd1700/oz at best on profit taking and long liquidation. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd hit resistance just ahead of 1.1500 and Usd/Chf based a few pips under 0.9200 as Eur/Chf bottomed around 1.0510 in advance of Swiss jobs data and sight deposits showing another rise in bank balances. Similarly, Cable waned after touching 1.3200 with Sterling still subject to hard Brexit jitters alongside the coronavirus and crude capitulation that pose growth and financial stability threats. However, the DXY remains vulnerable itself within a 95.694-94.719 range and not far from a key technical level at worst (94.080 representing a 50% retracement from ytd peak).</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Severe underperformance in extreme or bordering on unprecedented levels of aversion, especially through the cross-over from Asia-Pacific to European time zones has ravaged regional currencies, though the Lira has rebounded more than most on the vastly cheaper oil price as a net importer and the Yuan is holding firmly above 7.0000 after another decline in the Usd/Cny fix.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It may be somewhat premature or even remiss to contend that debt futures/cash yields have marked out their highs/lows for now, but as equites bounce from subterranean levels and the drilling in oil abates there is some degree of calm after the earlier storm. Hence, Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries are ‘only’ 1-2 points ahead vs over 2 to nearly 3 big figures above parity when thinner liquidity and catch up trade exacerbated the scramble for safe-haven assets. However, it remains to be seen what happens when US participants return to the fray and an hour earlier given that clocks went forward by 60 minutes before Europe at the end of March. Ahead, some NA data due, but it’s all about risk sentiment surrounding COVID-19 and now the next manoeuvres in crude markets.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p><strong>South Korea military noted that North Korea fired 3 unidentified projectiles off the east coast which was presumed to be multiple types of short-range projectiles</strong>, while it added this was part of ongoing firing drills and that the projectiles flew 200KM and reached 50KM in altitude. (Newswires)</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince MBS has accused two of Saudi’s most Senior Royals of treason following accusations of organising a coup against the Crown Prince; with the two royals in question regarded as among the few individuals in the way of MBS’ ascension (Guardian)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>A frantic session for commodities to say the least after sources over the weekend noted that Saudi Arabia will be boosting its output to above 10mln BPD from this month’s 9.7mln BPD as a response to the collapse of its OPEC+ alliance with Russia. Saudi is also said to have told market participants that it could raise output to as much as 12mln BPD, although sources stated that the initial increase is likely to total between 10-11mln BPD in April, with the final figure contingent on refiners’ response to price cuts. Furthermore, the Kingdom slashed its official pricing for crude, with oil giant Aramco cutting its Asia prices for Arab Light crude and Medium crude by USD 6/bbl each, to discounts of USD 3.10/bbl and USD 4.05/bbl below the Middle East benchmark respectively. In a challenge to Russia, the company made the largest cut to northwest Europe of some USD 8/bbl in most grades – Russia sells a bulk of its Urals crude in the same region. Arab Light sales to Europe will be at a USD 10.25/bbl discount to Brent – levels not seen since at least May 2002. As a result of the anticipated rising production and slash in OSPs – expected to flood the market with barrels – <strong>WTI and Brent futures sank 27% and 30% respectively</strong>, with the <strong>former paused for a few minutes following its aggressive >7% move</strong>. WTI Apr’20 briefly slipped below USD 28/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 41.50/bbl close, while Brent May 20 dipping south of USD 32/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 45.50/close – with the spread also narrowing to ~USD 3.80/bbl vs. ~4/bbl on Friday. The Kingdom hopes the slump in oil prices and the expected diminishing in Russia’s market shares will prompt Moscow back to the negotiating table and force its hand to cut output. Desks note that although this may prove effective in the short-term, it is in less certain what the longer-term impact will be. The front-month energy contracts have, as European players entered the markets, <strong>pared some losses with WTI Apr’20 now back to ~USD 32.50/bbl, with the 29th Jan 2016 low at USD 26.19/bbl, whilst the Brent May contract reclaimed a USD 36/bbl status</strong>.

Price action to the report was muted given the omission of a scenario that incorporates the weekend Saudi/Russian news. Elsewhere, spot gold failed to hold onto impetus from the global stock rout after prices briefly surpassed USD 1700/oz to the upside to prices last seen in December 2012. The yellow metal then waned off highs and into negative territory – potentially on profit-taking and as investors pump money into government debts in search of safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, copper conformed to the overall risk tone and gapped lower at the open, losing the USD 2.5/lb handle to a current low of USD 2.4675/lb.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia launched an oil price war to punish Russia following the breakdown of the oil deal in which the kingdom announced it will offer deep discounts by lowering OSP to all destinations by USD 6-8/bbl, while it is to raise crude output to more than 10mln bpd next month.</strong> (Newswires/FT)</p><p><strong>IEA Monthly Report:</strong> <strong>cut 2020 world oil demand forecasts by almost 1mln BPD</strong>, due to the coronavirus<strong>; envisage the first contraction since 2009</strong>.

It’s worth noting that sentiment has begun to recuperate somewhat, with US equity futures trading briefly above the limit down positions that were hit overnight <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/circuit-breakers-7-13-and-20-circuit-breakers-in-us-cash-equities-were-established-in-wake-of-the-1987-black-monday-crash-09-03-2020\">(Limit Down Details).</a> Given the commitments from Saudi to increase production to over 10.0mln BPD as of next month and they have cut the official selling price for all destinations by around USD 7/bbl, crude prices are as such lower by over USD 10/bbl and the energy sector has similarly recoiled (Stoxx Oil &amp; Gas -13%). The Oil &amp; Gas Sector accounts for 5.5% of the Stoxx 500 itself, and the largest weightings withing the sector are Total at 29.4%, BP with 15.5% and Shell contributing 14.5%; in terms of price performance, they are currently down by 13.3%, 15.7% and 16.7% respectively. Additionally, the overall downside is exacerbated by the FTQ seen overnight which has sent the global yield complex to record lows for most core parties. For instance, the entirety of the US yield curve is below 1% for the first time and the German 10yr low thus far resides at -0.86%. The Stoxx banking sector is the sector with the 3rd largest weighting in the Stoxx 600 representing 9.4% and is currently 7.3% down on the day. Elsewhere, sectors are all firmly in the red as is every open component in the Stoxx 600 itself; note, a number of Co’s failed, at least initially, to open. Looking ahead, focus turns to how markets react to the US’ entrance, particularly whether this exacerbates the sell-off; as well as for any indicative signs from any particular Co’s in the Energy/Banking sector regarding profit warnings, guidance changes or other telling comments.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>NOK/SEK/RUB/CAD/AUD/NZD - Risk sentiment has been roiled by Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase output and slash the cost of crude in response to the breakdown of OPEC+ talks last week when Russia refused to back a deeper cut in production, as prices tumble and compound fears over the economic fallout from China’s nCoV. Eur/Nok has hit highs just shy of 11.0000 and Eur/Sek topped 10.7500, while Usd/Rub peered over 75.0000 before WTI and Brent nursed some losses from just above Usd27 and Usd31 per barrel respectively. Meanwhile, Usd/Cad catapulted to 1.3750+ at one stage overnight and the Antipodean Dollars saw flash crashes that dragged Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd down to circa 0.6320 and 0.6030, but the Loonie, Aussie and Kiwi have all clawed back some lost ground as their US peer succumbs to pressure from sliding Treasury yields and more pronounced bull-flattening along the curve, not to mention heavy depreciation vs safer havens.</p><p>JPY/EUR/CHF/GBP - In stark contrast to all the above, Usd/Jpy has been trading largely in lock-step with oil with added impetus from risk-off flows/positioning between wide 104.58-101.58 parameters and the Yen retains a strong underlying bid unlike GOLD that has faded from a few bucks over Usd1700/oz at best on profit taking and long liquidation. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd hit resistance just ahead of 1.1500 and Usd/Chf based a few pips under 0.9200 as Eur/Chf bottomed around 1.0510 in advance of Swiss jobs data and sight deposits showing another rise in bank balances. Similarly, Cable waned after touching 1.3200 with Sterling still subject to hard Brexit jitters alongside the coronavirus and crude capitulation that pose growth and financial stability threats. However, the DXY remains vulnerable itself within a 95.694-94.719 range and not far from a key technical level at worst (94.080 representing a 50% retracement from ytd peak).</p><p>EM - Severe underperformance in extreme or bordering on unprecedented levels of aversion, especially through the cross-over from Asia-Pacific to European time zones has ravaged regional currencies, though the Lira has rebounded more than most on the vastly cheaper oil price as a net importer and the Yuan is holding firmly above 7.0000 after another decline in the Usd/Cny fix.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It may be somewhat premature or even remiss to contend that debt futures/cash yields have marked out their highs/lows for now, but as equites bounce from subterranean levels and the drilling in oil abates there is some degree of calm after the earlier storm. Hence, Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries are ‘only’ 1-2 points ahead vs over 2 to nearly 3 big figures above parity when thinner liquidity and catch up trade exacerbated the scramble for safe-haven assets. However, it remains to be seen what happens when US participants return to the fray and an hour earlier given that clocks went forward by 60 minutes before Europe at the end of March. Ahead, some NA data due, but it’s all about risk sentiment surrounding COVID-19 and now the next manoeuvres in crude markets.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>A frantic session for commodities to say the least after sources over the weekend noted that Saudi Arabia will be boosting its output to above 10mln BPD from this month’s 9.7mln BPD as a response to the collapse of its OPEC+ alliance with Russia. Saudi is also said to have told market participants that it could raise output to as much as 12mln BPD, although sources stated that the initial increase is likely to total between 10-11mln BPD in April, with the final figure contingent on refiners’ response to price cuts. Furthermore, the Kingdom slashed its official pricing for crude, with oil giant Aramco cutting its Asia prices for Arab Light crude and Medium crude by USD 6/bbl each, to discounts of USD 3.10/bbl and USD 4.05/bbl below the Middle East benchmark respectively. In a challenge to Russia, the company made the largest cut to northwest Europe of some USD 8/bbl in most grades – Russia sells a bulk of its Urals crude in the same region. Arab Light sales to Europe will be at a USD 10.25/bbl discount to Brent – levels not seen since at least May 2002. As a result of the anticipated rising production and slash in OSPs – expected to flood the market with barrels – <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures sank 27% and 30% respectively, with the former paused for a few minutes following its aggressive >7% move. <strong>WTI</strong> Apr’20 briefly slipped below USD 28/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 41.50/bbl close, while <strong>Brent</strong> May 20 dipping south of USD 32/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 45.50/close – with the spread also narrowing to ~USD 3.80/bbl vs. ~4/bbl on Friday. The Kingdom hopes the slump in oil prices and the expected diminishing in Russia’s market shares will prompt Moscow back to the negotiating table and force its hand to cut output. Desks note that although this may prove effective in the short-term, it is in less certain what the longer-term impact will be. The front-month energy contracts have, as European players entered the markets, pared some losses with <strong>WTI</strong> Apr’20 now back to ~USD 32.50/bbl, with the 29th Jan 2016 low at USD 26.19/bbl, whilst the Brent May contract reclaimed a USD 36/bbl status. Away from the OPEC debacle, IEA cut 2020 world oil demand forecasts by almost 1mln BPD, due to the coronavirus; envisage the first contraction since 2009, noting that Demand could drop by 730k BPD, in an extreme event where Gov't fails to contain the virus. Price action to the report was muted given the omission of a scenario that incorporates the weekend Saudi/Russian news. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> failed to hold onto impetus from the global stock rout after prices briefly surpassed USD 1700/oz to the upside to prices last seen in December 2012. The yellow metal then waned off highs and into negative territory – potentially on profit-taking and as investors pump money into government debts in search of safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> conformed to the overall risk tone and gapped lower at the open, losing the USD 2.5/lb handle to a current low of USD 2.4675/lb.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*LONG STORY SHORT:</strong></p><p><strong>Sources over the weekend noted that Saudi Arabia will be boosting its output to above 10mln BPD from this month’s 9.7mln BPD</strong> as a response to the collapse of the OPEC+ alliance with Russia. Saudi is said to have told market participants that it could raise output to as much as 12mln BPD, although sources stated that the initial increase is likely to total between 10-11mln BPD in April, with the final figure contingent on refiners’ response to price cuts.</p><p><strong>Furthermore, the Kingdom slashed its official pricing for crude,</strong> with oil behemoth Aramco cutting its Asia prices for Arab Light crude and Medium crude by USD 6/bbl each, to discounts of USD 3.10/bbl and USD 4.05/bbl below the Middle East benchmark respectively. In a challenge to Russia, the company made the largest cut to northwest Europe of some USD 8/bbl in most grades – Russia sells a bulk of its Urals crude in the same region. Finally, Arab Light sales to Europe will be at a USD 10.25/bbl discount to Brent – levels not seen since at least May 2002.</p><p><strong>*TENSIONS BUILDUP:</strong></p><p>The move by Saudi follows the collapse in ties with Russia after Moscow refused to yield to Saudi’s 1.5mln BPD output curb proposal but instead vied to extend the current cuts. <strong>The Kingdom hopes the slump in oil prices and the expected diminishing in Russia’s market shares will prompt Moscow back to the negotiating table</strong> and force its hand to cut output. Desks note that although this may prove effective in the short-term, it is in less certain what the longer-term impact will be.</p><p><strong>*PRICE ACTION:</strong></p><p>As a result of the anticipated rising production and slash in OSPs – expected to flood the market with barrels – <strong>WTI and Brent futures sank 27% and 30% respectively</strong>, with the former paused for a few minutes following its aggressive >7% move. WTI Apr’20 briefly slipped below USD 28/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 41.50/bbl close, while Brent May 20 dipping south of USD 32/bbl vs. Friday’s USD 45.50/close – with the spread also narrowing to ~USD 3.80/bbl vs. ~4/bbl on Friday.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, oil names bore the brunt of the slump in overnight trade – with <strong>Saudi Aramco shares sinking 10% (market cap now below USD 1.5tln),</strong> whilst Chinese and Australian producers also plumbed the depths, a move likely to reverberate in European and US oil stocks.</p><p><strong>*SGH MACRO VIEW:</strong></p><p>Understand that for any new agreement, the Saudis will&nbsp;now&nbsp;demand the Russians make real rather than token cuts in output and at the beginning rather than the end of the agreement period,&nbsp;and that&nbsp;seems unlikely to be forthcoming.</p><p><strong>*HOUSE CALL TWEAKS:</strong></p><p>In light of the latest developments, ING has slashed their Brent forecasts and now expect prices to average USD 33/bbl in Q2 (Prev. USD 56/bbl), with H2 prices expected to average ~USD 43/bbl (forecasts included below).</p><p>In terms of US supply, analysts at Berenberg expect the drop in WTI to trigger sharp declines in rig counts and production outlooks from Shale companies in the coming months. “If this is not enough to rebalance the market in the short term, then oil prices could approach cash cost levels to force shut-ins of existing wells to reduce production immediately, and historically that has required oil prices below USD30/bbl Brent”, the analysts said.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/ad67d9b3-bab6-4028-baab-0b5ee4e00e3d.jpg\"></figure>",

No one “reason” supported the price movement, but desks note ongoing haven flows amid the virus from real money buyers, flows from convexity buyers, and chunky short-covering from leveraged accounts, in addition to an unwinding of market hedges. Furthermore, investors are likely piling into duration ahead of the weekend, where participants again dare expose themselves to risk in the face of COVID-19 and an expected rise in US cases. The sharp decline in energy prices served as the cherry on the cake as investors begin pricing in lower inflation expectations and question the stability of the global economy, increasing the allure of the sovereign bond market.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets resumed their slump and US equity futures also suffered heavy losses in which the Emini S&amp;P hit limit down and DJIA futures pointed to another decline of over-1000 points, as oil prices slipped by around 30% after Saudi Arabia kicked off an oil price war. The kingdom announced plans to raise its output to over 10mln bpd beginning next month and it cut the OSP for all destinations by USD 6-8/bbl following last week’s breakdown of the OPEC+ output deal in which Russia rejected the proposal for additional cuts. ASX 200 (-7.3%) posted its largest intraday loss in more than 11 years amid a collapse across the energy sector although gold miners bucked the trend due to the flight to safety, while Nikkei 225 (-5.4%) gapped below 20K and continued to tumble against the backdrop of the detrimental currency flows and following the miss on Q4 GDP which further pointed to the likelihood of a looming recession. Hang Seng (-3.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.5%) conformed to the sell off as blue-chip energy names were pummelled and after continued PBoC liquidity inaction, while the latest trade data from China over the weekend showed a surprise Trade Deficit and a larger than expected contraction in Exports. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the bloodbath in stocks and as it tracked the advances in T-notes which surged nearly 2 points as US 10yr and 30yr yields delved into unprecedented levels, while the BoJ were also present in the market today for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets resume their slump and US equity futures also suffer heavy losses in which S&amp;P 500 futures hit limit down and with DJIA futures pointing to another slide of over 1000 points, as oil prices slipped by as much as 30% after Saudi Arabia kicked off an oil price war. The kingdom announced plans to raise its output to over 10mln bpd beginning next month and it cut the OSP for all destinations by USD 6-8/bbl following last week’s breakdown of the OPEC+ output deal after Russia rejected the proposal for additional cuts. ASX 200 (-5.7%) slipped over 6% to notch its largest intraday loss in more than 11 years amid a collapse across the energy sector although gold miners buck the trend due to the flight to safety, while Nikkei 225 (-5.8%) gapped below 20K and continued to tumble against the backdrop of the detrimental currency flows and following the miss on Q4 GDP which further points to the likelihood of a looming recession. Hang Seng (-4.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.5%) conform to the sell off as blue-chip energy names are pummelled and after continued PBoC liquidity inaction, while the latest trade data from China over the weekend showed a surprise Trade Deficit and a larger than expected contraction in Exports.</p><p>FX markets are tumultuous in which the DXY slipped below the 95.00 level despite last week’s better than expected US NFP jobs data and lower Unemployment Rate, with pressure seen amid the decline in yields in which the 10yr yield fell to a fresh record low beneath 0.5% and the 30yr yield breached under 1.0% for the first time ever. In addition, Fed Fund Rate futures price in 98.5% probability of another 50bps cut by the Fed this month, while the greenback’s woes benefitted its transatlantic counterparts in which EUR/USD briefly approached 1.1500 where it was met with heavy resistance and GBP/USD momentarily eyed a reclaim of the 1.3100 handle. The spooked sentiment and sell-off in crude also reverberated across currencies resulting to a bout of panic selling in USD/JPY which briefly fell below 102.00 to levels last seen in 2016, while commodity linked currencies AUD, CAD and NZD were also pressured resulting to a mini flash crash in which AUD/USD and NZD/USD gave up around 2 points in less than a minute to trade with losses of more than 4.5% before reversing the majority of the nose dive.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the bloodbath in stocks and as it tracks the gains in T-notes which have surged nearly 2 points as US 10yr and 30yr yields slip to unprecedented levels, while the BoJ are also present in the market today for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs.&nbsp;</p>",
