        "content": "<p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US President Trump signed an executive order declaring national emergency to address threats to telecommunication networks from some foreign firms as expected. (Newswires)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US are in serious talks with China to improve trade relationship and that there is still a lot of work which needs to be done on China trade negotiations. Furthermore, Mnuchin stated they are likely to go to Beijing at some point in the near future to continue China talks, while there were separate reports that the US delegation could head to China for trade talks as early as next week. (Newswires/Axios)</p><p>China's MOFCOM spokesperson Geng stated that China will take countermeasures to the 'bullying' from the US. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK PM May will tell the executive of the 1922 Committee she needs several more weeks to pass key Brexit legislation in meeting tomorrow, according to FT's political correspondent Laura Hughes. (FT)</p><p>UK Labour Party spokesman said the party will not support the Brexit bill as it currently stands. Furthermore, ITV Political Editor Peston tweeted Labour MP Emily Thornberry said her party will vote against WAB and signalled cross-party talks may collapse as soon as tomorrow, while Conservative MPs Vaizey and Bridgen agree PM May will be out next month. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>UK Brexit Secretary Barclay said there is an underappreciation that a no deal could happen, while he added there is no automatic right of extension and that his personal preference would be to prepare for a no deal. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Coeure said global headwinds are still weighing on Euro area growth and that the global slowdown has delayed ECB normalisation. Furthermore, Coeure also stated that the governing council is ready to adjust all instruments as is appropriate and that the creating of a common euro area safe asset in the long-term may be beneficial if this is done in such a way as to not undermine fiscal policy incentives. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Praet said persistency of uncertainties is undermining confidence and creating major risks to global economies.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>Iran Revolutionary Guard Commander said we are on the cusp of a full-scale confrontation with the enemy and that the Islamic Republic is at its most decisive moment in history due to enemy pressure. (Newswires)</p><p>Florida Senator Marco Rubio noted that earlier actions of US Embassy in Iraq ordering all non-emergency government staff to leave Iraq is not the prelude to a US attack against Iran but warned if Iran attacked, the US will respond decisively. (Newswires)</p><p>UAE said it is committed to peace as well as de-escalation and wants to emphasise caution. Furthermore, it added there are serious problems including Iran's behaviour although it has not concluded investigation on oil tanker attacks. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>US President Trump is planning to delay imposing EU tariffs on auto imports by up to 6-months, according to sources. In related news, President Trump reportedly still wants to hold the threat of auto tariffs on the EU as leverage but is aware that Republicans are at the brink of their tolerance towards tariffs given the current situation with China according to Axios. (Newswires/Axios)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated US, Mexico and Canada are near a deal to remove tariffs on metals, while it was also reported that USTR Lighthizer planned to float a proposal in a meeting with Canada's Freeland which charts a path forward on USMCA that would include a process for the removal of steel and aluminium tariffs. (Newswires/CNBC)</p><p>Fed's Quarles (Voter, Neutral) said the US economy is strong and unemployment is low. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawk) said it makes sense for the Fed to remain patient on rates and that inflation weakness is likely transitory. Barkin added there is not a strong case to move rates higher with inflation under control, nor is there a strong case to move rates lower when growth remains healthy.

Take Two (TTWO) and EA (EA) were particularly buoyant after news emerged that legislation to ban the controversial “loot boxes” in games is unlikely to be passed through this year. Pfizer (PFE) shares moved higher after the firm announced positive results from the Phase 3 stage of a study into Abrocitinib, which treats Atopic Dermatitis. Twitter (TWTR) were supported as the social media platform announced that it had launched a search tool aiming to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding vaccinations. Similarly, Facebook (FB) was also buoyed after the firm announced changes to its platform, saying it has taken steps to restrict those who misuse its livestreaming feature. Boeing (BA) reversed early losses, catching a bid as news emerged that the FAA expected Boeing to submit its 737 MAX software fix for approval within the next week or so. Salesforce (CRM) shares were under pressure after the software firm received a downgrade from OTR Global, which cited limited upside and customers who appear more cautious than usual. Applied Materials (AMAT) were lifted after an upgrade at Sasquehanna. S&amp;P 500 +0.6% at 2851, NASDAQ-100 +1.4% at 7503, Dow Jones +0.5% at 25652.</p><p>Trade sentiment was again the driving factor for Treasury price moves on Wednesday. In early trade, however, the T-Note was again taking its cue from EGB's, where the Bund/BTP spread widened as participants digested comments from the Italian Deputy PM Salvini, who stated that EU deficit rules can be breached if measures would support growth (Setting up another conflict with both his coalition partners, as well as the EU). But since US traders got to their desks, the T-Note essentially became more horizontal (continuing to rise until news broke that Trump had pushed-back the decision on imposing auto tariffs on imports of EU vehicles, but then seeing modest negative ticks). At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch wider/unchanged. US T-notes (M9) futures settled 11 ticks higher at 124-21+.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong> Equities up, Dollar flat, Treasuries up, Crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>US President Trump postpones tariffs on European auto imports, USTR Lighthizer meets Canada Foreign Minister to move USMCA forward, Poor US Data, Poor China Data, CA CPI inline</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> AU Employment Data, JN Corporate Goods, IT CPI, US Housing Data, Initial Jobless Claims, Philadelphia Fed Business Index, RBA’s Bullock, ECB’s Praet, de Guindos, Riksbank’s Floden</p><p><strong>* TUESDAY’S EARNINGS:</strong> EU; Generali US; Applied Materials, Baidu, NVIDIA, Walmart</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Ahead of the 18 May deadline, US President Trump decided to delay imposing EU tariffs on auto imports by up to 6-months. Some desks were anticipating the delay to these tariffs given that, with the EU already prepared to retaliate against any US tariffs, President Trump would be facing a trade war on two fronts, potentially presenting further economic headwinds heading into the 2020 elections. Moreover, there were reports that US President Trump, although still wanting to hold the threat of tariffs over the Europeans as leverage, is aware of fellow Republicans coming to the end of their tolerance for his protectionist policies. Switching fronts, USTR Lighthizer put forward a proposal today during meeting with Canada's Freeland, aiming to chart a path forward on the USMCA that would include a process for the removal of steel and aluminium tariffs. Freeland later commented talks had been productive but ratification of the USMCA would be difficult without the removal of US tariffs in Canadian steel imports. Elsewhere, the WSJ reported that US and Chinese negotiators were discussing dates for the US delegation to head to Beijing. While the meeting could be as early as next week, it will more likely shortly after that. The report was not clear on who would be attending the discussion which is set occur ahead of the G20 summit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* OVERNIGHT, AUSSIE JOBS DATA WILL BE RELEASED: </strong>Overnight, Aussie Q1 wage prices were short of expectations (2.3% Y/Y for third straight quarter vs RBA SOMP which pencilled in 2.4%), and while it is only slightly off the RBA's forecast, it challenges the RBA's view that wage growth is seen gradually improving. Governor Lowe recently said 3% Y/Y is needed to generate inflation at 2.5% Y/Y (mid-point of RBA range). April jobs data overnight is the next piece to the puzzle, and will receive more focus than usual given that the RBA \"will be paying close attention to developments in the labour market at its upcoming meetings\" and thus the next few releases will be critical in determining the timing of potential policy easing. The employment change is seen at +15k (prev. 25.7k, range 5k-25k, 3M average 23.7k), the unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 5.1% from 5.0% (range 4.9%-5.1%) and the participation rate is set to remain at 65.7% (range 65.5%- 65.7%). Westpac’s Jobs Index now suggest that employment growth should slow to around annualised rate of 2% in Q3, which points to an employment rise of +10k. Westpac notes that if the participation rate was unchanged, it would imply +17.8k rise in the labour force, lifting the unemployment rate. Some analysts are more sceptical that the RBA will cut rates in the near-term: ANZ said \"it will probably take more than this for the RBA to move, given the likely one-off impact of the election which will add thousands of (temporary) jobs,\" and it says a number jobs reports will be needed to establish a trend; thus, an August cut seems more likely than June or July, the bank said.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed VC Quarles, testifying to lawmakers on banking and supervision, stayed away from monpol, and said he sees strong competition in US banking sector. Fed's Barkin (non-voter) argued that it made sense for the Fed to be patient on rates, stating that there was no strong case to move rates either higher or lower. He also toed the line on inflation, saying it was likely that the weakness was transitory; on trade, Barkin said he was monitoring US-China trade developments, and its impact on business confidence, noting that if a settlement was reached, he wouldn't expect much of an impact on the economy, while the impact of any prolonged battle would likely be confined.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK government is to hold another vote on its withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) in the week of 3rd June. If not passed, Downing Street says, the feeling is either the UK is set for a no-deal Brexit or Article 50 being revoked as the EU is unlikely to grant an extension beyond 31st October (a notion that an EU official later said lacked credibility). The WAB is set to be published before the Parliamentary Summer recess on 23rd May and with PM May having alienated the Brexiteer branch of her own party as a result of the cross-part discussions, gaining support from the opposition Labour party will be critical to avoid a rejection. The cross-party talks are said to have been so far unsuccessful, with a Labour party spokesperson saying on Wednesday that the party would vote against the Withdrawal Bill if it did not meet their conditions. In regard to what changes have been made to the Brexit bill, composed of the WAB and the Political Declaration (PD), there has been little recent insight, but UK Brexit Secretary Barclay said the UK is exploring how much the PD can be changed amidst UK Brexit Negotiator Olly Robbins’ trip to Brussels. Elsewhere, Brexit Secretary Barclay said there was an underappreciation that a no deal Brexit could happen, adding that there is no automatic right of extension and his own personal preference would be to prepare for a no deal.</p><p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: </strong>A fall of 0.5% M/M missed expectations. Pantheon Macroeconomics explains, however, that the data may have been driven by calendar quirks. \"April was a relatively long month, with 22 working days, and the 15th - payday for people paid semi-monthly - fell after the payroll survey week, leading to under-reporting of activity in the sector,\" and says that \"months with both of these calendar events almost always report much weaker manufacturing output than usual; today’s report is consistent with previous experience.\" Pantheon says May's output will likely rebound strongly: \"The underlying trend is soft, in the wake of the drop in the ISM survey since last fall, but output is not collapsing and our fear of a clear manufacturing recession through the whole first half of the year might prove to be a bit too bearish.\" Risks are presented by the re-escalation of the trade war with China, but it remains of the view that the main drag on manufacturing has been the steep downturn in China's cycle, rather than the trade dispute, \"so US manufacturing should benefit as China cycle turns up.\"</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES:</strong> Retail sales missed expectations, falling 0.2% M/M in April against the consensus view looking for a rise, and suggests GDP growth could slow in Q2. The decline came despite the rise in gasoline station sales, outweighed by the fall in vehicle sales. But even accounting for these volatile items, the control group was still flat due to weakness in electronics, apparenl and non-store retail sales. \"Admittedly, following the upwardly-revised 1.1% surge in control group sales back in March, the 3m/3m annualised growth rate still rose to 3.2% last month, a five-month high,\" Capital Economics says, and as a result, \"real consumption growth remains on course to rebound to around 3% annualised in the second quarter, from only 1.2% in the first.\" But CapEco warns that with net trade set to provide a much smaller boost, and inventories likely to be a sizable drag, it continues to think that GDP growth will slow in the second quarter, to between 1.5% and 2.0% annualised. \"With last year's fiscal boost fading and the drag from higher borrowing costs still feeding through, we expect growth to slow further in the second half of this year,\" the consultancy writes.</p><p><strong>* US BUSINESS INVENTORIES: </strong>Inventories printed 0.0% in March, in line with the consensus. \"Businesses involuntarily accumulated inventories in recent months amid somewhat softer-than-expected sales, taking the inventories-to-sales ratio to a 27-month high 1.39 in February,\" Oxford Economics said. \"In March, a solid 1.6% jump in sales pushed the inventories-to-sales measure down to 1.37.\" The consultancy says that the latest inventories data points to a modest downward effect on the initial 3.2% real GDP growth estimate in Q1. Its own tracker still stands at 3.2%, given other modest upgrades from recent trade, construction, and retail data, but it expects that businesses will manage with relatively leaner inventory levels in the coming months, following the largely involuntary inventory build early in 2019.\"</p><p><strong>* CANADA CPI:</strong> Canadian CPI rose 0.4% M/M in April, in line with expectations, and the Y/Y rate accelerated to 2.0%, also in line with expectations. The average of the BOC measures fell to 1.90% from 1.97%. \"With inflation neither too hot nor too cold, the BOC can focus on indicators of growth in judging what, if any, adjustments have to be made to interest rates,\" CIBC writes, \"With strength in the labour market and a March rebound in exports suggesting a pick-up in growth in the second quarter, we don’t expect that the BOC will need to cut interest rates as markets have been pricing.\" But CIBC says that economic growth of only 1.5% this year and next, along with little inflationary pressures, does not necessitate tightening policy either.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>Following yesterday’s attacks on Saudi Aramco pumping stations along the East-West pipeline (the rebel Houthi group claimed the attacks), and the US suggesting Iran is behind the previous attacks on Saudi vessels, tensions are undoubtedly heightened both within the Middle East, as well as between the US and the west. Comments out of Tehran suggest the country is prepared for \"all scenarios,\" while there was also a dose of bellicose talk from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The US has also been increasing its presence in the region with Navy vessels and fighter jets, with reports from officials that the country is mulling sending a large amount of ground troops. The State Department said the US is not rushing into a conflict in the region, and US President Trump said there was no in-fighting within his administration regarding his strategy (which follows Tuesday's reports that Trump was not aware of some of the options the Pentagon was drawing up). Elsewhere, the UAE said it was committed to peace and de-escalation, but there are serious problems and one of them is Iran’s behaviour; it added that it was still carrying out its investigation on the Saudi oil tankers attacked in its waters.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.24 AT USD 62.02/BBL; BRENT (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.53 HIGHER AT USD 71.77/BBL.</strong> The crude complex was under pressure in the European session on Wednesday, hampered by poor risk appetite and Tuesday's bearish API inventory report; however, prices rebounded on more constructive risk sentiment throughout US trade, finishing the day in the green. The DoE report confirmed the surprise build in crude stocks reported by the API, albeit only a 5.4mln bbls build rather than the API’s 8.6mln. Gasoline stocks drew by 1.1mln bbls (exp. draw of 0.3mln), distillates built by 0.08mln bbls (exp. draw of 1.01mln); Cushing reported a build of 1.81mln bbls (exp. 0.82mln). US weekly production fell to 12.1mln BPD from 12.2mln. In an initial reaction, the market did sell off, but this was short-lived and overridden by bullish sentiment amidst reports President Trump was mulling delaying implementing EU tariffs on auto imports by up to six-months, as well as reports from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that the US was in \"serious talks\" with China to improve their trade relationship, and could be heading to Beijing within a week. Also supporting prices was overhanging tensions in the Middle East, with eyes on Iran following recent attacks on Saudi vessels as well as the US mulling bringing more forces to the region, casting concerns on the stability of supply in the region. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said OPEC+ will assess progress of the output curb pact at the meeting in Jeddah on May 19th, and echoing the OPEC SeCGen Barkindo on Tuesday, said it was too early to anticipate the future decision on the output cut deal.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 0.6% at 2851, NASDAQ-10 1.4% at 7503, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.5% at 25652, SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary 0.8%, Consumer Staples 0.8%, Energy 0.5%, Financials -0.5%, Health Care 0.3%, Industrials 0.1%, Information Technology 1%, Materials -0.2%, Telecommunication Services 2.1%, Utilities -0.1%</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Agilent Technologies (A) sunk after the technology co. reported weak earnings and revised down its revenue forecast for FY19. Take Two (TTWO) and EA (EA) were particularly buoyant after news emerged that legislation to ban the controversial “loot boxes” in games is unlikely to be passed through this year. Pfizer (PFE) shares moved higher after the firm announced positive results from the Phase 3 stage of a study into Abrocitinib, which treats Atopic Dermatitis. Twitter (TWTR) were supported as the social media platform announced that it had launched a search tool aiming to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding vaccinations. Similarly, Facebook (FB) was also buoyed after the firm announced changes to its platform, saying it has taken steps to restrict those who misuse its livestreaming feature. Boeing (BA) reversed early losses, catching a bid as news emerged that the FAA expected Boeing to submit its 737 MAX software fix for approval within the next week or so. Salesforce (CRM) shares were under pressure after the software firm received a downgrade from OTR Global, which cited limited upside and customers who appear more cautious than usual. Applied Materials (AMAT) were lifted after an upgrade at Sasquehanna.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (M9) FUTURES SETTLE 11 TICKS HIGHER AT 124-21+.</strong> Trade sentiment was again the driving factor for Treasury price moves on Wednesday. In early trade, however, the T-Note was again taking its cue from EGB's, where the Bund/BTP spread widened as participants digested comments from the Italian Deputy PM Salvini, who stated that EU deficit rules can be breached if measures would support growth (Setting up another conflict with both his coalition partners, as well as the EU). But since US traders got to their desks, the T-Note essentially became more horizontal (continuing to rise until news broke that Trump had pushed-back the decision on imposing auto tariffs on imports of EU vehicles, ut then seeing modest negative ticks). At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch wider/unchanged.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: EUR </strong>was initially under pressure early doors as the Bund-BTP spread widened on the back of further rhetoric from Italy Deputy PM Salvini regarding the need for greater expansionary fiscal policy. However, the single-currency caught a bid after reports that US President Trump is to delay tariffs on European auto imports by six-months, EURUSD popped back above 1.1200. Conversely, <strong>USD</strong>, which had been on the front foot (despite mixed data), reversed course to finish the day relatively flat. <strong>GBP </strong>was not able to benefit from the rally in its neighbour the EUR, with comments from Brexit Secretary Barclay talking up the possibility of a no deal exit doing little to help. <strong>JPY </strong>strengthened in the morning amid fragile risk sentiment, but reversed course as reports of a delay to US tariffs on EU auto imports gave equities a boost. <strong>EMFX</strong> rallied for another day, with the exception of <strong>BRL</strong>, after Brazil Economy Minister Guedes hinted on Tuesday that 2019 growth forecasts may be cut (which was quickly followed a slew of GDP growth forecast cuts from banks including the likes of Goldman Sachs). <strong>XAU</strong>, which was testing the 1300 handle, rebounded today but lost steam on the news that US tariffs on EU auto imports would be delayed, settling just shy of the psychological USD 1,300 mark.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>* PREVIEW - AUSSIE JOBS: Overnight, Aussie Q1 wage prices were short of expectations (2.3% Y/Y for third straight quarter vs RBA SOMP which pencilled in 2.4%), and while it is only slightly off the RBA's forecast, it challenges the RBA's view that wage growth is seen gradually improving. Governor Lowe recently said 3% Y/Y is needed to generate inflation at 2.5% Y/Y (mid-point of RBA range). April jobs data overnight is the next piece to the puzzle, and will receive more focus than usual given that the RBA \"will be paying close attention to developments in the labour market at its upcoming meetings\" and thus the next few releases will be critical in determining the timing of potential policy easing. The employment change is seen at +15k (prev. 25.7k, range 5k-25k, 3M average 23.7k), the unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 5.1% from 5.0% (range 4.9%-5.1%) and the participation rate is set to remain at 65.7% (range 65.5%- 65.7%). Westpac’s Jobs Index now suggest that employment growth should slow to around annualised rate of 2% in Q3, which points to an employment rise of +10k. Westpac notes that if the participation rate was unchanged, it would imply +17.8k rise in the labour force, lifting the unemployment rate. Some analysts are more sceptical that the RBA will cut rates in the near-term: ANZ said \"it will probably take more than this for the RBA to move, given the likely one-off impact of the election which will add thousands of (temporary) jobs,\" and it says a number jobs reports will be needed to establish a trend; thus, an August cut seems more likely than June or July, the bank said.</p>",

The DoE report confirmed the surprise build in crude stocks reported by the API, albeit only a 5.4mln bbls build rather than the API’s 8.6mln. Gasoline stocks drew by 1.1mln bbls (exp. draw of 0.3mln), distillates built by 0.08mln bbls (exp. draw of 1.01mln); Cushing reported a build of 1.81mln bbls (exp. 0.82mln). US weekly production fell to 12.1mln BPD from 12.2mln. In an initial reaction, the market did sell off, but this was short-lived and overridden by bullish sentiment amidst reports President Trump was mulling delaying implementing EU tariffs on auto imports by up to six-months, as well as reports from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that the US was in \"serious talks\" with China to improve their trade relationship, and could be heading to Beijing within a week. Also supporting prices was overhanging tensions in the Middle East, with eyes on Iran following recent attacks on Saudi vessels as well as the US mulling bringing more forces to the region, casting concerns on the stability of supply in the region. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said OPEC+ will assess progress of the output curb pact at the meeting in Jeddah on May 19th, and echoing the OPEC SeCGen Barkindo on Tuesday, said it was too early to anticipate the future decision on the output cut deal.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/CHF/USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All bid to varying degrees as the brief respite and relative calm after Monday’s risk aversion evaporated amidst a series of disappointing macro releases, kicking off overnight with ip and retail sales from China and extending to US retail sales and ip, coincidentally. Usd/Jpy retreated from 109.70 to circa 109.16 in response and through 109.23 Fib support again that remains pivotal on a closing basis. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf eased back from just shy of 1.0100 towards 1.0050 as Eur/Chf reversed through 1.1300 and the Franc maintained bullish momentum vs the single currency amidst heightened investor angst over Italian political and financial stability. However, the Dollar also proffered from the demise of others to keep the <strong>DXY </strong>on an upward trajectory and edging a fresh session best of 97.700, just below chart resistance at 97.743 before reports broke about a potential 6 month delay to US tariffs on EU autos boosted the Euro especially and risk appetite overall.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling still looks all set to end Wednesday’s EU session as the G10 laggard as Cable lost grip of another big figure level at 1.2900 and tripped stops on a break of a recent low through 1.2850 to extend losses towards 1.2825, while Eur/Gbp breached the 100 DMA (0.8695), 0.8700 and resistance at 0.8722 on the aforementioned possible EU car tax reprieve. Prior to the latter, the Pound was undermined by a broad downturn in sentiment and the ongoing Brexit impasse between the Tory and Labour Parties, not to mention within the Government and across Parliament, as PM May faces the 1922 Committee tomorrow and plans to return to the HoC with the WA early next month. Elsewhere, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd also derived some traction from the EU auto tariff headlines and more talk that US officials will likely head back to China for further trade talks soon, but not before the former tumbled to yet another new multi-month low of 0.6915 in wake of soft Aussie wage data and ahead of Thursday’s jobs report, while the latter traded mostly weaker between 0.6575 and 0.6550.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency seemed to have lost sight of 1.1200 amidst the latest comments from Italy’s Salvini stressing that keeping the economy afloat is more important than sticking to fiscal guidelines, but rebounded firmly from circa 1.1178 lows on the auto news and general recovery in market morale. However, Eur/Usd needs to clear big figure-plus chart levels to sustain the recovery and mount another challenge on m-t-d peaks of 1.1265.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another Lira revival, but typically not on independent factors or intervention as Usd/Try only revisited 6.0000 when the overall mood improved rather than on encouraging Turkish data like a smaller budget deficit.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Going into the US session, crude markets appear to be taking their cues from the muted risk appetite alongside digesting the bearish API US inventory report on Tuesday. The API reported US crude stocks building a substantial 8.6mln bbls in the previous week, catching the market off guard where expectations were set for a draw of 1.3mln bbls. The weekly report also showed surprise draws in the products as well as Cushing building over 2mln bbls; the market will be paying close attention to Wednesday’s official DoE inventory release to see whether inventories were indeed this bearish.</li><li>The IEA released its monthly report for May, with the main talking point being it cutting its 2019 oil demand growth estimate by 90K BPD to 1.3mln BPD, in contrast to yesterday’s OPEC monthly report where total world oil demand growth for 2019 was left unchanged at 1.21mln BPD. While the EIA did raise their forecast for 2019 global oil demand by 20k BPD to 1.38mln BPD, the EIA report was released prior to the implementation of US-China tariffs and as such is not comparable to either the IEA or OPEC reports.</li><li>With China trade tensions buoying fears of faltering demand, market participants have recently been noting the growing divergence of correlation between demand factors and oil prices, with supply factors dominating the narrative. UBS analyst Dominic Ellis notes, “I continue to believe that only the most extreme outcomes on trade could have a lasting effect on oil demand,” he adds further, “it seems likely that problems on the supply side are likely to persist for longer than the current concerns on demand.”</li><li>Geopolitics is likely to continue remain in the headlights for the time being, with seemingly daily escalations of tensions in the middle east. With yesterday’s attacks on Saudi Aramco pumping stations along the East-West pipeline (the rebel Houthi group have claimed the attacks), and the US suggesting Iran is behind the previous attacks on Saudi vessels in one way or another, it is reasonable to believe the market is placing a risk premium on prices currently. Comments out of Tehran suggest the country is prepared for “all scenarios”, whether that be confrontation or diplomacy. The US has also been increasing its presence in the region with Navy vessels and fighter jets, with reports from officials that the country is mulling sending a large amount of ground troops, just in case, it says.</li></ul>",

Crude prices then recovered off lows amid positive sentiment in Asia-Pac trade before an intensifying risk-averse mood pressured the complex. Upside in the energy market is also capped by the IEA Monthly Oil Report which cut 2019 oil demand growth estimate by 90k bpd to 1.3mln bpd, in contrast to yesterday’s OPEC monthly report where the total world oil demand growth for 2019 was left unchanged at 1.21mln BPD. On a technical front, WTI Jun’19 futures reside just below its 50 DMA (61.45) ahead of its 200 DMA (60.40) whilst its Brent counterpart seems to have been recently finding support its 50 DMA (currently at 69.78). Looking ahead, traders will be keeping an eye out for the more widely followed EIA crude stocks release later today wherein ING agrees that numbers similar to the API would likely be seen as bearish in the immediate term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, the receding buck and soured risk tone has modestly supported gold (+0.3%) in recent trade, as the yellow metal fluctuates above its 100 DMA (1296.64) and in close proximity to the 1300/oz level. Meanwhile, Chinese steel production increased by 12.7% Y/Y to the highest level on record as stronger margins allowed steel mills to increase utilisation rates. However, ING believes that margins can come under pressure moving forwards as “the more recent strength in Chinese steel prices [are] reflecting stock building following the Chinese New Year.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>IEA Monthly Report: Cuts 2019 oil demand growth estimate by 90k bpd to 1.3mln bpd</p><p>- Global oil supply in April fell 300k bpd; losses led by Canada, Iran, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan</p><p>- Non-OECD countries will drive global oil demand in 2019, adding 1.1mln bpd of growth, with China and India growing by 0.7mln bpd</p><p>- OPEC crude output rose 60k bpd in April to 30.21mln bpd as higher flows from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq offset Iranian losses</p><p>- In Q2 2019, refining throughput is seeing a third consecutive quarter of lacklustre growth, but is expected to climb by 1mln bpd a month between May and August</p><p>- OECD oil stocks fell by 25.8mln bbls in March, more than the five-year average of 4mln bbls owing to counter-seasonal crude draws</p><p>- - For reference, yesterday’s OPEC report kept 2019 oil demand growth unchanged at 1.21mln, and prior to this the EIA did increase their 2019 demand forecast; however, as the EIA report was released prior to the implementation of US-China tariffs it is not seen as comparable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Crude prices then recovered off lows amid positive sentiment in Asia-Pac trade before an intensifying risk-averse mood pressured the complex. Upside in the energy market is also capped by the IEA Monthly Oil Report which cut 2019 oil demand growth estimate by 90k bpd to 1.3mln bpd, in contrast to yesterday’s OPEC monthly report where the total world oil demand growth for 2019 was left unchanged at 1.21mln BPD. On a technical front, WTI Jun’19 futures reside just below its 50 DMA (61.45) ahead of its 200 DMA (60.40) whilst its Brent counterpart seems to have been recently finding support its 50 DMA (currently at 69.78). Looking ahead, traders will be keeping an eye out for the more widely followed EIA crude stocks release later today wherein ING agrees that numbers similar to the API would likely be seen as bearish in the immediate term.</p><p>Elsewhere, the receding buck and soured risk tone has modestly supported gold (+0.3%) in recent trade, as the yellow metal fluctuates above its 100 DMA (1296.64) and in close proximity to the 1300/oz level. Meanwhile, Chinese steel production increased by 12.7% Y/Y to the highest level on record as stronger margins allowed steel mills to increase utilisation rates. However, ING believes that margins can come under pressure moving forwards as “the more recent strength in Chinese steel prices [are] reflecting stock building following the Chinese New Year.”</p>",

Usd/Chf has retreated towards 1.0050 again and Eur/Chf is back down below 1.1300 even though the single currency remains relatively resilient vs a broadly firm Dollar having survived another test of 1.1200 with the aid of some firm Eurozone GDP prints. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has also pulled back from yesterday’s rebound highs to probe bids under 109.50 and expose Fib support at 109.23 that was breached on Monday when the headline pair got to within a whisker of 109.00. Note, however, decent option expiry interest may keep the headline pair afloat given 1.2 bn rolling off between 109.00-20 and almost 1.8 bn at 109.40-50.

Aud/Usd is just off fresh multi-month lows around 0.6920 and Aud/Nzd is pivoting 1.0550 as the Kiwi hovers just above 0.6550 against the Greenback. Meanwhile, the Loonie is meandering between 1.3476-56 and in a tighter range than on Tuesday awaiting some independent impetus/direction from Canadian CPI that is due alongside US retail sales and with the <strong>DXY </strong>equally contained within 97.432-578 parameters and just above the 30 DMA (97.417).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira remains in the spotlight and volatile after yesterday’s seemingly impressive recovery, as Usd/Try bounced back over 6.0000 despite more efforts by the CBRT to stop the rot via a return of taxes on certain FX transactions.

The catalyst ongoing concerns about the US-China trade dispute, albeit less pronounced than earlier this week to a degree, renewed Italian fiscal issues that have now seen BTPs probe below 128.50 technical support, and of course Brexit.

Although sentiment surrounding US-China trade has calmed somewhat compared to the anxiety and aversion seen on Monday, Bunds are still elevated amidst more provocative comments from Italy about breaking the fiscal boundaries to ensure that the economy recovers and jobs are not jeopardised. Indeed, after attempting to pare some of their recent losses and reclaiming 129.00+ status BTPS are back below the big figure and testing technical support ahead of 128.50 in the form of Tuesday’s 128.83 low. Ahead, Italian industrial sales data will be watched closely in this context before Eurozone GDP, employment, German 30 year supply and a raft of primary US releases, plus ECB and Fed speakers. Back to Eurex, and the 10 year German debt future is hovering around the middle of a 166.57-71 range so far vs the 166.59 previous close.</p>",

(It is also worth noting that, earlier in the session, the Treasury complex once again took its cue from EGBs; Italy's Deputy PM Salvini said he was “willing to break EU fiscal rules,” which added some positive ticks in the bond complex.). As on Monday, the complex saw a more risk-friendly configuration following (another batch of) optimistic comments from US President Trump, later in the US session, having previously criticised China on Twitter earlier in the day. Attention will at least focus on the US data slate for Wednesday, which includes US retail sales, industrial production, NAHB, and the Empire State manufacturing survey. At settlement, major curve spreads were flat-to-very-slightly steeper. US T-notes (M9) futures settled 3 ticks higher at 124-10+.</p><p><strong>Fed's George (Voter, Hawk)</strong> said current low level of inflation does not demand a response and that the Fed's current patient stance is appropriate, while she does not see any arguments at the moment to justify a rate cut and suggested the Fed must keep an eye on the long run.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) are mixed with tech leading the gains in Australia as it tracks the outperformance of the sector stateside, while Tokyo trade mirrors a somewhat indecisive currency with heavy losses seen in Takeda and Nissan shares post-earnings in which the latter fell by the most since 2016 due to a 57% decline in FY net. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) are positive after President Trump’s encouraging rhetoric and with the first phase of the PBoC’s targeted RRR adjustment taking effect today which would release around CNY 100bln of long-term funds, although gains are somewhat capped after disappointing Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat overnight but remains near the prior day’s highs above the 97.50 level as its major counterparts languish in which EUR/USD tested the 1.1200 level to the downside after the recent soft EU industrial output and German economic sentiment data, while GBP/USD remains near 3-week lows around 1.2900 as PM May faces increasing pressure to step down. Furthermore, the latest reports suggest PM May will aim to put the Withdrawal Agreement to parliament in the first week of June with many doubtful of the chances of its success, and Labour party leader Corbyn also reiterated to PM May that they will not back her Brexit plan without concessions. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy amid indecisiveness in Tokyo and antipodeans are slightly weaker following the miss on Australian Wage Price Index, as well as disappointing Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data in which the latter grew at the weakest pace since May 2003.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price action hampered by the ambiguous risk tone in Japan and with today’s BoJ Rinban operation at a relatively paltry JPY 505bln concentrated in the belly.</p>",
