(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Risk has started the week on the front foot, with desks citing easing of lockdown restrictions on the horizon as the supporting factor. The BOJ lifted restrictions on bond-buying overnight, allowing it to theoretically buy unlimited amounts of government bonds to achieve its YCC targets; there will be attention on the Fed and ECB meetings later in the week (Weds and Thurs, respectively). Additionally, mega tech companies MSFT, AAPl, GOOG, AMZN and FB will be reporting numbers this week; collectively, they represent around 21% of the SPX market cap. Morgan Stanley highlight the growing market concentration of the top five market cap companies in the SPX (currently MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOGL) which since 2016, has grown from just above 10% to just below 20% - a level not seen since the 1970’s Nifty Fifty era. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly delaying its 2020 iPhone production ramp-up by approximately one month, although it still plans to release four new iPhones later in the year and is looking to slash H2 production by up to 20%, according to WSJ citing sources. Boeing Company (BA) announced it has terminated the JV agreement with Embraer (ERJ), who believes the termination was wrongfully terminated and made false claims. Meanwhile, two influential proxy advisory firms have recommended that BA shareholders vote against key board members to protest how it handled the 737 MAX crisis, according to WSJ, however, all 12 directors received majority shareholder votes. SPX +1.5% at 2878, NDX +0.6% at 8838, DJIA +1.5% at 34,134.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, amid a constructive risk backdrop which was supported by optimism on the easing of lockdown restrictions. Action was light ahead of key risk events this week (Fed, ECB, key corporate earnings). The BOJ overnight effectively announced unlimited QE, which was also said to be supporting risk in APAC trade. Additionally, there was talk of desks selling to make way for supply. Although the FOMC meeting this week is only expected to “take stock” of the situation, with no major announcement expected, desks will, however, be keeping an eye on any commentary regarding Japanese/Australian-style YCC on the horizon. The US Treasury sold both 2-year and 5-year notes today - both solid auctions that stopped-through the screens on decent demand. Starting with the former, which was sold at 0.229% (from the prior 0.39%), stopping-through by a chunky 1.3bps - the largest amount since July 2012; cover was 3.1x, the highest since January 2018. Direct participation was in line with recent averages, and indirects took a higher share than recent sales, leaving dealers with the lowest since last November. The 5s auction was similar, but to a lesser extent, stopping through by 0.7bps.&nbsp; Both auctions highlight that, despite projections of the US deficit rising to above USD 3trln in 2020, demand is still strong for shorter-dated Treasuries; some have suggested that this is as the market eyes potential yield curve control from the Fed, which isn’t likely to be a feature of Wednesday’s confab, though will be a key issue into the June FOMC, where some believe that the Fed might pledge to leave rates at the effective lower bound for a couple of years, supported by its action in controlling short-term yields. T-notes (M0) settled 14+ ticks lower at 138-21.</p>",

The BOJ lifted restrictions on bond-buying overnight, allowing it to theoretically buy unlimited amounts of government bonds to achieve its YCC targets; there will be attention on the Fed and ECB meetings later in the week (Weds and Thurs, respectively). Additionally, mega tech companies MSFT, AAPl, GOOG, AMZN and FB will be reporting numbers this week; collectively, they represent around 21% of the SPX market cap. Results from Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir in a US trial on severe COVID-19 patients is due in the coming days, which will likely nudge markets depending on the tone of the results if the other recent updates are anything to go by.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Monday (via state official health departments) against weekend:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US</strong>: Cases +3.15% at 957,875 (prev. 928,619); death toll +2.8% at 53,922 (Prev. 52,459)</li><li><strong>NEW YORK</strong>: cases +1.4% at 291,996 (prev. +2.1% at 288,045); death toll rises 2% to 17,303 (prev. +2.2% at 16,966); Cuomo says they will extend the stay at home order beyond May 15th in many parts of the state</li><li><strong>ITALY: </strong>Cases rise 0.9% to 199,414 (prev. +1.2% at 197,675), death toll rises 1.3% to 26,077 (prev. +1.0% at 26,644).

But markets will still be paying attention to some health statistics, of course, particularly on reinfections. An analysis by the FT suggests that the global death toll could be 60% higher than reported, with mortality statistics showing 122k deaths in excess of normal levels across 14 countries, considerably higher the FT says than the 77k official Covid-19 deaths reported for the same places and time periods.</p><p><strong>US STIMULUS v4.0: </strong>US President Trump’s Economic Adviser Hassett said Q2 GDP will be the largest negative number since the Great Depression, likely seeing a contraction in the magnitude of 20-30%, though he believes Q3 will likely be positive. Hassett called on lawmakers to enact further stimulus, warning that without it, there would not be a V-shaped recovery. Markets now have expectations that the fourth tranche of stimulus will be focusing on relief for States and local governments, infrastructure spending, and additionally, support for US energy companies feeling the strain under the collapse of global crude prices. Elsewhere, Fox News reported that US banks expect the next round of PPP pandemic stimulus loans to run out within days; last week, some desks had suggested that this could be taken as a sign that the funds are filtering through to the real economy quickly. Meanwhile, House Speaker Pelosi said Democrats will press for oversight of COVID-19 relief packages. Note, Senate Majority Leader McConnell announced the Senate will return on May 4th although there will be a modified routine. The return of the senate could perhaps speed up the process of the next round of stimulus.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>BOJ: </strong>The key interest rate was left unchanged at -0.1% and forward guidance tweaked in which the reference to price momentum was dropped - as touted by sources last week. The Bank reaffirmed its pledge to further ease without hesitation if necessary, whilst Governor Kuroda did not rule out deeper negative rates as a future option but said it's hard to see rates declining. The Bank of Japan removed its JPY 80trln limit on buying government bonds, and can now buy an unlimited amount of government bonds to meet its objective to keep 10-year yields around zero; the move comes at a time when the government will be boosting debt issuance to finance its COVID-19 response. The BOJ said it would buy JGBs and short-term securities \"actively\" to keep markets stable. It also increased the scale of buying commercial paper and corporate debt (almost trebling from JPY 7.4trln to JPY 20trln/year). Its forecasts saw the central bank cut its forecasts and projected that it will miss its 2% inflation goal for three more years. Elsewhere, the bank broadened accepted collateral in its operations. Citi's analysts do not think the announcement has much material impact for financial market players, and the bank explains: 1) the Fed has already announced unlimited bond purchases effectively and has been enacting this; 2) the BOJ has decreased JGB purchases remarkably since 2017; purchased amounts, which totalled close to JPY 80trln in 2016, decreased to only JPY 15trln last year, and its annualised size has grown only to JPY 30trln since this February when purchases reaccelerated; 3) under the current YCC framework, asset purchases play only a secondary role.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLES USD 4.16 LOWER AT USD 12.78/BBL, WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 3.14 LOWER AT 18.08/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 1.45 LOWER AT USD 19.99/BBL, BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 1.74 LOWER AT USD 23.07/BBL</strong></p><p>Another session of chunky losses for crude futures, albeit off the lows, again led by the nearby contracts as storage concerns linger and participants move further out the crude term structure. The June WTI futures were particularly hit after the USO fund announced that between today and month-end, it would withdraw any exposure to the June contract, and increase exposure further down the curve and even into 2021. Elsewhere, the DoE announced that the SPR had seen stocks build by 1.1mln bbls over the week ending April 24th – a somewhat expected update, but given recent builds (e.g. +20mln in US weekly crude stocks), the 1.1mln will have little balancing effect. Participants looking for a more stable oil market in the coming weeks will likely be disappointed, Goldman Sachs warns, “commodities are spot assets, not anticipatory assets and must clear current supply and demand, which still remain extremely out of balance in all markets.” The bank caveats that the market is now at an inflection phase with rebalancing having commenced, although could take between eight-to-twelve weeks before it believes it can confidently argue that a bottom has been made.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>T-NOTES (M0) SETTLED 14+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-21.</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, amid a constructive risk backdrop which was supported by optimism on the easing of lockdown restrictions. Action was light ahead of key risk events this week (Fed, ECB, key corporate earnings). The BOJ overnight effectively announced unlimited QE, which was also said to be supporting risk in APAC trade. Additionally, there was talk of desks selling to make way for supply. Although the FOMC meeting this week is only expected to “take stock” of the situation, with no major announcement expected, desks will, however, be keeping an eye on any commentary regarding Japanese/Australian-style YCC on the horizon.</p><p><strong>AUCTIONS:</strong> The US Treasury sold both 2-year and 5-year notes today - both solid auctions that stopped-through the screens on decent demand. Starting with the former, which was sold at 0.229% (from the prior 0.39%), stopping-through by a chunky 1.3bps - the largest amount since July 2012; cover was 3.1x, the highest since January 2018. Direct participation was in line with recent averages, and indirects took a higher share than recent sales, leaving dealers with the lowest since last November. The 5s auction was similar, but to a lesser extent, stopping through by 0.7bps.&nbsp; Both auctions highlight that, despite projections of the US deficit rising to above USD 3trln in 2020, demand is still strong for shorter-dated Treasuries; some have suggested that this is as the market eyes potential yield curve control from the Fed, which isn’t likely to be a feature of Wednesday’s confab, though will be a key issue into the June FOMC, where some believe that the Fed might pledge to leave rates at the effective lower bound for a couple of years, supported by its action in controlling short-term yields.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.5% at 2878, NDX +0.6% at 8838, DJIA +1.5% at 34,134.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Financials +3.6%, Real Estate +3%, Materials +2.6%, Industrials +2.5%, Energy +2.1%, Health Care +1.3%, Communications +1.3%, Consumer Discretionary +1.2%, Utilities +1.1%, IT +0.9%, Consumer Staples +0.3%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Morgan Stanley highlight the growing market concentration of the top five market cap companies in the SPX (currently MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOGL) which since 2016, has grown from just above 10% to just below 20% - a level not seen since the 1970’s Nifty Fifty era. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly delaying its 2020 iPhone production ramp-up by approximately one month, although it still plans to release four new iPhones later in the year and is looking to slash H2 production by up to 20%, according to WSJ citing sources. Boeing Company (BA) announced it has terminated the JV agreement with Embraer (ERJ), who believes the termination was wrongfully terminated and made false claims. Meanwhile, two influential proxy advisory firms have recommended that BA shareholders vote against key board members to protest how it handled the 737 MAX crisis, according to WSJ, however, all 12 directors received majority shareholder votes. BA CEO announced the jet manufacturer will have to borrow more money over the next six months, adding it will be years before it begins paying dividends again. Diamond Offshore (DO) filed for its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, weighing on Lowe’s (L) who own a majority stake in the co. and will face a USD 1.5bln loss from the bankruptcy. General Motors (GM) announced it has extended USD 3.6bln under its revolving credit facility to April 2022, while suspending its quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase programme. Of note for some cloud names, Alphabet Google (GOOG) is reportedly in talks to acquire cloud company D2iQ, according to Axios citing sources familiar with the matter. Expectations are that D2iQ would be valued over USD 250mln it raised from Venture Capitalists, although less than the USD 775mln valuation it received.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> As of Friday night (04/24/20), Credit Suisse highlight that 28.2% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap has reported 1Q results. Although earnings are missing estimates in aggregate by -3.4%, ex-Financials earnings are surpassing expectations by 6.3%, with 72% of companies exceeding their lowered projections. Note, the top 5 weighted SPX companies (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOGL) are all scheduled to report this week.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> With sentiment improving amid global reopening updates (NY could be as early as May 15th, Italy May 4th), the dollar has sold off some of its gains and the DXY now trades beneath 100. Elsewhere, with month-end approaching, Barclay's month-end rebalancing model points to moderate USD selling.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The yen was firmer to start the week despite improved risk sentiment while the BoJ announced unlimited QE to assist with yield curve control, while it also announced it would increase purchases of corporate bonds and dropped its reference to price momentum in its forward guidance, in line with source reports last week.&nbsp; Despite the easing, albeit expected, and improved risk sentiment USDJPY fell to lows of 107.00 with analysts highlighting 106.93 as a key support level. Today’s option expiries also likely had an impact with USD 1.2bln rolling off at the 107 figure.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency is flat against the greenback at pixel time although it had been firmer in the morning after S&amp;P left Italy’s rating unchanged at BBB; outlook negative, while many had expected a downgrade. Also reassuring is Italy’s plans to exit lockdown on May 4th will also support sentiment as any re-opening or vaccine updates seem to be the current market drivers. Focus this week on the Euro will be with the ECB on Wednesday, with many eyeing any potential updates to its PEPP.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD:</strong> Cyclical currencies performed well today amid the improved risk sentiment with the Aussie the G10 outperformer amid the announcement Queensland will relax restrictions from May 1st and parts in the West will be able to hold gatherings of up to 10 people. Analysts at Citi highlight their bullish case for the currency noting the large fiscal package, low capita cases of COVID-19 which has led to lighter lockdown measures and the close ties with Asian economies which are expected to recover faster given the earlier exposure to COVID-19.&nbsp; NZD also performing well and traded above 0.60 throughout the day with the country set to re-open tomorrow.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling firmer in line with its cyclical counterparts amid the improved risk sentiment while gains could also be attributed to the return of Boris Johnson in power after recovering from the coronavirus. Cable had reclaimed 1.24 to the upside, a level it resides around at pixel time, after seeing highs at 1.2450, technical analysts at Credit Suisse look for resistance in the cross at the 55-day average resistance at 1.2526.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> Despite the fallout in oil prices today, the loony was resilient perhaps trading off risk rather than oil today with USDCAD back beneath 1.41. Scotia highlight the moves in equities with Vix beneath 40 are encouraging for CAD. The desk writes “We expect the CAD will continue to move to the beat of risk appetite to a large extent but weak crude prices—which are likely to persist for some weeks at least—will limit scope for gains.”</p><p><strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed today amid improved risk sentiment and falling oil prices. RUB was weaker amid the declining oil prices with Brent (M0) trading sub USD 20/bbl and WTI (M0) seeing lows beneath USD 12/bbl. However, RUB was only slightly weaker against a falling buck. Elsewhere, MXN &amp; ZAR both firmer amid improved risk sentiment, while BRL underperforms.</p><p><strong>BRL:</strong> A senior public prosecutor has requested the authority to investigate allegations of political interference by President Bolsonaro, the BBC reported. It follows last week's resignation of Justice Minister Moro, who accused Bolsonaro of trying to install a new federal police chief who would provide him with intelligence reports. Bolsonaro has denied the reports, although it throws an unwelcome distraction into the mix as the country tries to battle COVID.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> Trading more in line with risk sentiment than domestic drivers. Over the weekend, Treasury officials confirmed the country is seeking USD 5bln in loans from the IMF/World Bank/New Development Bank.</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong> The Lira is weaker against the buck, with desks citing remarks from a health ministry official who said the true number of infections in the country was likely higher than the reported official figures implied. However, Lira losses may be limited by the fall in oil prices.</p><p><strong>MXN:</strong> Although there are no firm timelines, Mexico will apparently re-open auto factories in line with the US and Canada. MXN trades firmer today in line with risk sentiment, largely ignoring the decline in crude prices today.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD:</strong> With sentiment improving amid global reopening updates (NY could be as early as May 15th, Italy May 4th), the dollar has sold off some of its gains and the DXY now trades beneath 100. Elsewhere, with month end approaching, Barclays month end rebalancing model points to moderate USD selling.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The yen was firmer to start the week despite improved risk sentiment while the BoJ announced unlimited QE to assist with yield curve control, while it also announced it would increase purchases of corporate bonds and dropped its reference to price momentum in its forward guidance, in line with source reports last week. Despite the easing, albeit expected, and improved risk sentiment USDJPY fell to lows of 107.00 with analysts highlighting 106.93 as a key support level. Today’s option expiries also likely had an impact with USD 1.2bln rolling off at the 107 figure.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency is flat against the greenback at pixel time although it had been firmer in the morning after S&amp;P left Italy’s rating unchanged at BBB; outlook negative, while many had expected a downgrade. Also reassuring, is Italy’s plans to exit lockdown on May 4th will also support sentiment as any re-opening or vaccine updates seem to be the current market drivers. Focus this week on the Euro will be with the ECB on Wednesday, with many eyeing any potential updates to its PEPP.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD:</strong> Cyclical currencies performed well today amid the improved risk sentiment with the Aussie the G10 outperformer amid the announcement Queensland will relax restrictions from May 1st and parts in the West will be able to hold gatherings of up to 10 people. Analysts at Citi highlight their bullish case for the currency noting the large fiscal package, low capita cases of COVID-19 which has led to lighter lockdown measures and the close ties with Asian economies which are expected to recover faster given the earlier exposure to COVID-19. NZD also performing well and traded above 0.60 throughout the day with the country set to re-open tomorrow.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Sterling firmer in line with its cyclical counterparts amid the improved risk sentiment while gains could also be attributed to the return of Boris Johnson in power after recovering from the coronavirus. Cable had reclaimed 1.24 to the upside, a level it resides around at pixel time, after seeing highs at 1.2450, technical analysts at Credit Suisse look for resistance in the cross at the 55-day average resistance at 1.2526.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> Despite the fallout in oil prices today, the loony was resilient perhaps trading off risk rather than oil today with USDCAD back beneath 1.41. Scotia highlight the moves in equities with vix beneath 40 are encouraging for CAD. The desk writes “We expect the CAD will continue to move to the beat of risk appetite to a large extent but weak crude prices—which are likely to persist for some weeks at least—will limit scope for gains.”</p><p><strong>EMFX </strong>was mixed today amid improved risk sentiment and falling oil prices. RUB was weaker amid the declining oil prices with Brent (M0) trading sub USD 20/bbl and WTI (M0) seeing lows beneath USD 12/bbl. However, RUB was only slightly weaker against a falling buck. Elsewhere, MXN &amp; ZAR both firmer amid improved risk sentiment, while BRL underperforms.</p><p><strong>BRL: </strong>A senior public prosecutor has requested the authority to investigate allegations of political interference by President Bolsonaro, the BBC reported. It follows last week's resignation of Justice Minister Moro, who accussed Bolsonaro of trying to install a new federal police chief who would provide him with intelligence reports. Bolsonaro has denied the reports, although it throws an unwelcome distraction into the mix as the country tries to battle COVID.</p><p><strong>ZAR: </strong>Trading more in line with risk sentiment than domestic drivers. Over the weekend, Treasury official confirmed the country is seeking USD 5bln in loans from the IMF/World Bank/New Development Bank.</p><p><strong>TRY: </strong>The Lira is weaker against the buck, with desks citing remarks from a health ministry official who said the true number of infections in the country was likely higher than the reported official figures implied. However, Lira losses may be limited by the fall in oil prices.</p><p><strong>MXN:</strong> Although there are no firm timelines, Mexico will apparently re-open auto factories in line with the US and Canada. MXN trades firmer today in line with risk sentiment, largely ignoring the decline in crude prices today.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>TREASURIES: </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, amid a constructive risk backdrop which was supported by optimism on the easing of lockdown restrictions. Action was light ahead of key risk events this week (Fed, ECB, key corporate earnings). The BOJ overnight effectively announced unlimited QE, which was also said to be supporting risk in APAC trade. Additionally, there was talk of desks selling to make way for supply. Although the FOMC meeting this week is only expected to “take stock” of the situation, with no major announcement expected, desks will however be keeping an eye on any commentary regarding Japanese/Australian-style YCC on the horizon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUCTIONS: </strong>The US Treasury sold both 2-year and 5-year notes today - both solid auctions that stopped-through the screens on decent demand. Starting with the former, which was sold at 0.229% (from the prior 0.39%), stopping-through by a chunky 1.3bps - the largest amount since July 2012; cover was 3.1x, the highest since January 2018. Direct participation was in line with recent averages, and indirects took a higher share than recent sales, leaving dealers with the lowest since last November. The 5s auction was similar, but to a lesser extent, stopping through by 0.7bps. &nbsp;Both auctions highlight that, despite projections of the US deficit rising to above USD 3trln in 2020, demand is still strong for shorter-dated Treasuries; some have suggested that this is as the market eyes potential yield curve control from the Fed, which isn’t likely to be a feature of Wednesday’s confab, though will be a key issue into the June FOMC, where some believe that the Fed might pledge to leave rates at the effective lower bound for a couple of years, supported by its action in controlling short-term yields. &nbsp;</p>",

The June WTI futures were particularly hit after the USO fund announced that between today and month end, it would withdraw any exposure to the June contract, and increase exposure further down the curve and even into 2021. Elsewhere, the DoE announced that the SPR had seen stocks build by 1.1mln bbls over the week ending April 24th – a somewhat expected update, but given recent builds (e.g. +20mln in US weekly crude stocks), the 1.1mln will have little balancing effect. Participants looking for a more stable oil market in the coming weeks will likely be disappointed, Goldman Sachs warns, “commodities are spot assets, not anticipatory assets and must clear current supply and demand, which still remain extremely out of balance in all markets.” The bank caveats that the market is now at an inflection phase with rebalancing having commenced, although could take between eight-to-twelve weeks before it believes it can confidently argue that a bottom has been made.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>YEN</strong></p><p>The BoJ left benchmark rates on hold as universally expected, but removed QE limits for JGBs and raised the pace of corporate bond purchases in line with reports ahead of April’s policy meeting. However, despite removing price momentum from its forward guidance and Governor Kuroda’s subsequent downbeat/dovish press conference the Yen gradually appreciated against the Buck to test a decent 1.2 bn expiry option at the 107.00 strike for Monday’s NY cut before bouncing. Moreover, the headline pair appeared to defy convention and direction normally associated with wider risk sentiment that improved on more signs of global economies planning exit strategies from various states of COVID-19 lockdown.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars have been outperforming from the outset on the aforementioned loosening coronavirus restrictions ticket, with NZ apparently ready to start reopening as soon as tomorrow and just after Anzac Day. Nevertheless, the Aussie remains in pole position down under and across the major grid, with Aud/Usd holding above key Fib resistance at 0.6450 vs Nzd/Usd hovering around 0.6050 as the cross climbed towards 1.0675 ahead of NZ trade data later on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>Sterling derived some traction from UK PM Johnson returning to action, but lost momentum circa 1.2450 against the Greenback and 0.8710 vs the Euro after he refrained from announcing any firm date to end lockdown and warned that the country is at the moment of maximum risk. Cable retreated towards 1.2400 and Eur/Gbp rebounded to test the 200 DMA (0.8733) amidst some talk of early month end RHS demand. Note, Chancellor Sunak rolled out more financial provisions for small businesses in the form of fully guaranteed loans with the government to pay interest for the first year, but the Pound was largely unaffected. Similarly, the Loonie shrugged off another collapse in crude prices to trade mostly midway or near the bottom of a 1.4116-1.4040 range, with Usd/Cad capped by the <strong>DXY</strong> waning on attempts to climb above the 100.000 mark in advance of month end (with a UK clearer flagging moderate selling).</p><p><strong>EUR/NOK/CHF/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Euro has been relatively restrained ahead of the Fed and ECB amidst low expectations of any fresh policy stimulus from either, but the bar not high for surprises given the scale of nCoV fallout in the US and Eurozone. Hence, Eur/Usd was tightly bound between 1.0861-10 parameters and considerably narrower for the most part, though the single currency pared back a chunk of its losses vs the Franc following another big rise in Swiss bank sight deposits. Indeed, Eur/Chf bounced firmly to around 1.0580 and Usd/Chf spent the bulk of the session nearer 0.9766 than 0.9713. Elsewhere, whippy trade in Scandinavia saw the Swedish Krona steal a march early on as the Norwegian Crown took heed of the aforementioned weakness in oil, but the tables turn on some jitters before the Riksbank policy meeting on Tuesday where the repo rate path may be lowered.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Intervention from the BCB and HKMA, albeit for distinctly different reasons as the Real reeled again in stark contrast to the Hong Kong Dollar staying close to the top of its pegged band, while the Rand celebrated SA Freedom Day with the aid of a lifeline extended to at least 1 of the country’s ailing stated-owned entities.

As such, much attention for this week’s ECB meeting will be on whether this amount is raised with some desks calling for it to be increased to as much as EUR 2trl, though its not clear as to whether such a figure would be allotted in one go or in stages as it is deemed necessary.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>Equities have started the week on the front foot amid DM economies making further steps to reopening, and perhaps more importantly, faith in a COVID-19 treatment to avoid similar outbreaks/lockdowns; note that results on Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir for use on extreme/severe cases in the US are expected to be released in the coming days, which given the markets recent sensitivity to updates around the drug, will be closely watched by participants. Stimulus remains supportive ahead of the ECB and Fed meetings this week, with the former meeting likely to be more exciting given current debate over a European fiscal package, although attention on the Fed lies very much around its intentions for its asset purchase programmes going ahead (UBS believes the June meeting will contain more details). Meanwhile this morning, oil prices are again taking a tumble, at odds with equities compared to the synchrony last week. Yields are a couple of basis points higher across the Treasury curve, with upcoming 2- and 5-year auctions weighing on the front-end, although how much further they can rise appears limited given growing expectations for front-end YCC from the Fed. While the positive risk appetite is supporting activity currencies at the expense of the dollar.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>The majority of sectors open in the green with Energy the only one in negative territory as oil prices take a turn for the worst while the bankruptcy from Diamond Offshore (DO) also adds to concerns in the shale industry. On the flip side, Financials, Real Estate and Consumer Discretionary lead the way, with the former likely benefiting from marginally higher yields.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) is reportedly delaying its 2020 iPhones production ramp-up by approximately one month, although it still plans to release four new iPhones later in the year and is looking to slash H2 production by up to 20%, according to WSJ citing sources. Boeing Company (BA)) announced it has terminated the JV agreement with Embraer (ERJ), who believe the termination was wrongfully claimed and made false claims. Meanwhile, two influential proxy advisory firms have recommended that BA shareholders vote against key board members to protest how it handled the 737 MAX crisis, according to WSJ. Diamond Offshore (DO) filed for its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, weighing on Lowe’s (L) who own a majority stake in the co. and will face a USD 1.5bln loss from the bankruptcy. General Motors (GM) announced it has extended USD 3.6bln under its revolving credit facility to April 2022, while suspending its quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase programme.</p><p><strong>BULLISH ON THE CONSUMER:</strong> Morgan Stanley takes a more contrarian view on the US consumer, suggesting that the group went into this downturn firmer than the GFC and that recent market excesses were centred in the corporate channel. The analysts say the dips in consumer confidence and retail sentiment are not as bad as that in the GFC and 1990 recessions, believing that levels won’t need to fall to the same extent as before. Furthermore, the bank says recent stimulus has been directed at the consumer, unlike prior crashes.</p><p><strong>MARKET CONCENTRATION: </strong>Morgan Stanley highlight the growing market concentration of the top five market cap companies in the SPX (currently MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, JNJ) which since 2016, has grown from just above 10%, to just below 20% - a level not seen since the 1970’s Nifty Fifty era. The tailwind for such concentration has been a combination of declining equity risk premium, earnings resilience and rising valuations, noting that the current strength has been relative expected earnings resilience to the rest of the index/market. Looking ahead, the bank sees room for reversal in a COVID-19 recovery, “we expect the market cap giants to underperform cyclical and smaller cap companies during the recovery as relative earnings strength reverses.” Supporting the reversal call, MS says the timing of bottoming earnings estimates is important, which it does believe is now occurring as it cites week-over-week net change in earnings revision breadth turning (modestly) positive last week for the first time since late January; “In the last two recessions, once the revision factor turned up, it didn't look back.”</p>",

Bourses see broad-based gains but Italy’s FTSE MIB (+2.5%) modestly outperforms after S&amp;P refrained from downgrading the country’s rating on Friday. Sectors all reside in positive territory, with Financials leading the gains – propped up by Deutsche Bank (+11.2%) earnings – whilst energy underperforms amid price action in the oil complex. This performance is also reflected in the sector breakdown with Banks the outperformer and Oil &amp; Gas the laggard, Travel &amp; Leisure resides towards the top amid lockdown lifts across Europe and US. In terms of individual movers, earnings see more focus on German firms; DAX-giant Bayer (+2.7%) sees impetus from Q1 revenue and adj. EBITDA topping analyst estimates, and improvement in EPS and gains across all its units – the Co. accounts for 6.8% of the DAX 30. Adidas (+2.5%) conformed to the broad risk-appetite after nursing opening losses of over 3%, which initially emanated from dismal earnings alongside a failure to provide FY20 guidance. Adidas noted that 70% of its global stores remain shut. Deutsche Bank (+11.2%) shares soar on an early earnings release in which Q1 pre-tax posted a profit of EUR 206mln vs. Exp. loss 269mln, albeit the group notes that it is unlikely to meet its FY20 leverage ratio target of 4.5%. A spokesman said the release of key metrics was due to a significant divergence with analyst forecasts – Commerzbank (+6.5%) rises in sympathy. Elsewhere, Lufthansa (+7.2%) was propelled at the open after Germany’s Economy Minister stated the group must get a chance to return to profitability, whilst the Co. is also seeking a EUR 290mln loan from the Belgium gov’t for its Belgian subsidiary. Similarly, Air France-KLM (+4.7%) and Renault (+5%) see upside after the French gov’t announced a EUR 7bln package for the former, whilst mulling a EUR 5bln loan guarantee for the latter. On the flip side, Airbus (-1.5%) is pressured amid comments from its CEO regarding the severity of the group’s position – stating that the Co. is “bleeding cash” at a rate which threatens the Co’s existence, adding that a third of its business has been lost in the past few weeks.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Greenback has retreated further against G10 counterparts and almost across the board, with the DXY struggling to retain grip or sight of the 100.000 mark within a 100.320-99.847 range amidst an upturn in broad risk sentiment that is only really being tainted by more weakness in crude oil on bearish supply/storage-demand dynamics.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD -</strong> The Aussie and Kiwi are both seemingly reaping the rewards of relative progress and success on the coronavirus front as the respective Governments eye reopening schedules. Aud/Usd is now firmly back above 0.6400 and pivoting 0.6450, while Nzd/Usd is straddling 0.6050 and Aud/Nzd is probing above 1.0650 on Anzac Day. Note, NZ markets return on Tuesday and will be looking towards trade data for some fundamental direction/impetus in the same vein as Australia’s preliminary report last week.</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> The next best major and the Pound could well be receiving another Boris boost as the UK PM returns to his official residence to resume duties with an encouraging update on Britain’s battle to combat COVID-19. Cable has reclaimed 1.2400+ status and Eur/Gbp is meandering between 0.8754-10 parameters with the cross retreating below its 200 DMA again.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/EUR -</strong> The Loonie is also outpacing its US peer even though oil prices are tanking again, with Usd/Cad under 1.4100 ahead of somewhat dated Canadian securities balances for February, while the Yen has strengthened in wake of the BoJ policy meeting despite further stimulus via QE as speculated ahead of the event. Usd/Jpy got close to 107.00 before a mild bounce that could have been option expiry related given 1.2 bn rolling off at the strike, but also technical as strong chart support sits just beneath the round number circa 106.93/92 (April 15th and 1st lows). On the flip-side, 2 bn expiries from 107.50 to 107.60 may cap the headline pair, while the Euro has 1.1 bn at 1.0800 to provide a cushion alongside a raft of options in to the Fed and ECB on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.</p><p><strong>CHF/NOK/SEK -</strong> The Swiss Franc and Norwegian Krona are marginal underperformers following latest weekly sight deposits revealing another significant rise in bank coffers, while the latter is eyeing the aforementioned weakness in crude, like the Russian Rouble. However, the Swedish Crown continues to hold up better on the premise that the Riksbank will stick to its guns on rates tomorrow in favour of non-standard policy measures should the situation warrant more than already implemented. Hence, Usd/Chf idling within a 0.9744-13 band, Eur/Chf off recent near 1.0500 lows between 1.0532-58, Eur/Nok rotating around 11.5000, Usd/RUB encircling 74.5000 and Eur/Sek still suppressed sub-10.9000.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Some much needed respite for the Rand that has pared declines from 19.1000+ amidst the aforementioned revival in risk appetite, but Usd/Zar may be impacted by thinner than normal volumes due to SA’s Freedom Day holiday, while the Hong Dollar remains close to the top of its peg vs the Dollar prompting the HKMA to intervene again.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It’s been a gradual fade against the backdrop of broad risk-on positioning in asset markets with the exception of crude that is sliding again, and June WTI especially, <strong>but Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries</strong> are all back underwater to varying degrees, as the 10 year UK benchmark nestles just above a fresh 136.84 Liffe low.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and<strong> Brent </strong>front-month futures have resumed selling off as storage scarcity continues to weigh on investor sentiment – with the former underperforming amid reports that Cushing, Oklahoma, may hit full capacity soon.&nbsp; Goldman Sachs believes that storage capacity limits could be tested in as little as three weeks. This week also sees the official implementation of the OPEC+ reduction pact, but some members, including Saudi, have brought forward cuts in a bid to somewhat stabilise the price rout. ING, among other desks, believes that the move is “helpful, [but] it will have little impact on the oil balance in the short term.” Nonetheless, despite the recent geopolitically induced upside in prices – underlying fundamentals remain unchanged. That being said, with major economies set to loosen lockdown restrictions, pressure on demand could start to ease – early signs could be seen in China as refinery activity at independent refiners has been hitting record levels in the Shandong region. WTI June briefly dipped below USD 14.50/bbl to a current base at USD 14.18/bbl (vs. high USD 16.98/bbl), whilst its Brent counterpart sees declines in tandem having tested USD 20/bbl to the downside in early trade (vs. high USD 21.91/bbl). Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> sees losses despite a softer Buck, with desks attributing the pressure to improved risk appetite on countries lifting COVID-19 measures. The yellow metal remains comfortably north of USD 1700/oz, having waned off highs of around USD 1720/oz. <strong>Copper prices</strong> meanwhile remain in the green but somewhat subdued amid a slump in Chinese Industrial profits – prices edging towards USD 2.37/lb vs. high of around USD 2.39/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures recovered as stocks of the raw material fell to their lowest in over 9 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback has retreated further against G10 counterparts and almost across the board, with the <strong>DXY </strong>struggling to retain grip or sight of the 100.000 mark within a 100.320-99.847 range amidst an upturn in broad risk sentiment that is only really being tainted by more weakness in crude oil on bearish supply/storage-demand dynamics.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi are both seemingly reaping the rewards of relative progress and success on the coronavirus front as the respective Governments eye reopening schedules. Aud/Usd is now firmly back above 0.6400 and pivoting 0.6450, while Nzd/Usd is straddling 0.6050 and Aud/Nzd is probing above 1.0650 on Anzac Day. Note, NZ markets return on Tuesday and will be looking towards trade data for some fundamental direction/impetus in the same vein as Australia’s preliminary report last week.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The next best major and the Pound could well be receiving another Boris boost as the UK PM returns to his official residence to resume duties with an encouraging update on Britain’s battle to combat COVID-19. Cable has reclaimed 1.2400+ status and Eur/Gbp is meandering between 0.8754-10 parameters with the cross retreating below its 200 DMA again.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>The Loonie is also outpacing its US peer even though oil prices are tanking again, with Usd/Cad under 1.4100 ahead of somewhat dated Canadian securities balances for February, while the Yen has strengthened in wake of the BoJ policy meeting despite further stimulus via QE as speculated ahead of the event. Usd/Jpy got close to 107.00 before a mild bounce that could have been option expiry related given 1.2 bn rolling off at the strike, but also technical as strong chart support sits just beneath the round number circa 106.93/92 (April 15th and 1st lows). On the flip-side, 2 bn expiries from 107.50 to 107.60 may cap the headline pair, while the Euro has 1.1 bn at 1.0800 to provide a cushion alongside a raft of options in to the Fed and ECB on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.</p><p><strong>CHF/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Swiss Franc and Norwegian Krona are marginal underperformers following latest weekly sight deposits revealing another significant rise in bank coffers, while the latter is eyeing the aforementioned weakness in crude, like the Russian Rouble. However, the Swedish Crown continues to hold up better on the premise that the Riksbank will stick to its guns on rates tomorrow in favour of non-standard policy measures should the situation warrant more than already implemented. Hence, Usd/Chf idling within a 0.9744-13 band, Eur/Chf off recent near 1.0500 lows between 1.0532-58, Eur/Nok rotating around 11.5000, Usd/<strong>RUB</strong> encircling 74.5000 and Eur/Sek still suppressed sub-10.9000.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some much needed respite for the Rand that has pared declines from 19.1000+ amidst the aforementioned revival in risk appetite, but Usd/Zar may be impacted by thinner than normal volumes due to SA’s Freedom Day holiday, while the Hong Dollar remains close to the top of its peg vs the Dollar prompting the HKMA to intervene again.</p>",

However, upside was initially restricted by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector after big 4 bank NAB posted a 51% slump in cash profit and unveiled plans for a substantial share placement, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (+2.6%)</strong> outperformed amid a weaker currency and the BoJ policy announcement where the central bank announced further measures including a shift to unlimited bond buying as widely speculated. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.9%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) </strong>were also higher with Hong Kong surging as its government was said to consider easing social distancing controls and the mainland somewhat lagged after weak Chinese Industrial Profits which contracted by almost 35% Y/Y. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lower amid the gains in stocks and similar pressure in T-notes, although JGBs prices were later boosted after the BoJ policy announcement in which the central bank also upped its corporate bond and commercial paper purchases with the maximum limits of purchases from a single issuer upped to JPY 500bln and JPY 300bln respectively from JPY 100bln.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net neutral on the day.

As such, <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was relatively flat at the 1.0800 handle and near about EUR 1.6bln of option expiries set to roll off at today’s New York cut, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was firmer and briefly broke above 1.2400 with reports suggesting UK PM Johnson could ease lockdown restrictions before the May 7th deadline. <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were mostly higher on the constructive risk tone although <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was initially flat before slipping lower despite the BoJ’s actions which markets had widely anticipated, while antipodeans were lifted by the risk appetite which helped <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> reclaim the 0.6400 handle and spurred <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> to prod the 0.6050 level despite the absence of participants in New Zealand for ANZAC Day.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed with <strong>oil</strong> prices resuming their downturn amid the ongoing demand-related concerns and widespread views the incoming OPEC++ cuts are insufficient in offsetting the demand rout brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. As such, <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures declined below the USD 16.00/bbl and although there weren’t much fresh catalysts for the energy complex overnight, recent reports had suggested the US Oil Fund could adjust its allocations to increase holdings of later month contracts. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were subdued by the positive risk tone but with downside stemmed by a weaker greenback, while copper outperformed due to the risk appetite and reopening hopes.</p><p><strong>Baker Hughes US Rig Count (w/e Apr. 24th) oil rigs fell by 60 to 378 and nat gas rigs fell by 4 to 85, while total rigs fell by 64 to 465</strong>.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Choppy day for the Treasury complex, albeit in tight ranges with the 10-year yield bouncing between 58/62bps, before moving lower on the updated Fed purchases schedule. As risk appetite rose in the European session, T-Notes and Bunds were offered from their highs overnight. However, after the US cash equity open gains were pared in equities/oil and yields were anchored from rising any further; note that relatively less corporate issuance likely also supported the Treasury curve. Then later, yields broke out of their range to the downside as investors digested the less pronounced cut in Fed asset purchases of USD 10bln/day from 35bln/day (read below). By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.22, 10s -2bps at 0.59, and 30s -3bps at 1.17%. Meanwhile, Short end rates were supported after the 3-month USD LIBOR posted a chunky 10bps fall, supporting front pack Eurodollars and seeing swap spreads and FRA-OIS tighten.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly positive with sentiment underpinned by optimism regarding the reopening of global economies after some US states began to reopen businesses and with Italy, Spain and France preparing to ease restrictions after recording their lowest death tolls in a month. ASX 200 (+1.5%) was led higher by tech and industrials with sentiment also supported by loosening of lockdown measures after Queensland announced to permit some outings from next Saturday. However, upside was initially restricted by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector after big 4 bank NAB posted a 51% slump in cash profit and unveiled plans for a substantial share placement, while Nikkei 225 (+2.6%) outperformed amid a weaker currency and the BoJ policy announcement where the central bank announced further measures including a shift to unlimited bond buying as widely speculated. Hang Seng (+1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were also higher with Hong Kong surging as its government was said to consider easing social distancing controls and the mainland somewhat lagged after weak Chinese Industrial Profits which contracted by almost 35% Y/Y. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lower amid the gains in stocks and similar pressure in T-notes, although JGBs prices were later boosted after the BoJ policy announcement in which the central bank also upped its corporate bond and commercial paper purchases with the maximum limits of purchases from a single issuer upped to JPY 500bln and JPY 300bln respectively from JPY 100bln.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly positive with sentiment underpinned by optimism regarding reopening of global economies after some US states began to reopen businesses and with Italy, Spain and France preparing to ease restrictions after recording their lowest death tolls in a month. ASX 200 (+0.6%) is led higher by tech and industrials with sentiment also supported by loosening of lockdown measures after Queensland announced to permit some outings from next Saturday. However, upside is restricted by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector after a 51% slump in cash profit and plans for a substantial share placement by big 4 bank NAB, while Nikkei 225 (+2.0%) outperforms amid a weaker currency and ahead of the BoJ policy announcement where there is speculation the central bank is to announce further measures and that a shift to unlimited bond buying could be on the cards. Hang Seng (+1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) are also higher with Hong Kong outperforming as its government is said to consider easing social distancing controls and with the mainland somewhat lagging after weak Chinese Industrial Profits which contracted by almost 35% Y/Y.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is weaker overnight amid a lack of demand for safe havens but remains above the 100.00 level as participants also look ahead to this week’s key releases including US GDP, as well as the latest central bank policy meetings from the Fed and ECB. As such, EUR/USD is flat at the 1.0800 handle and near around EUR 1.6bln of option expiries set to roll off at today’s New York cut, while GBP/USD is firmer and briefly broke above 1.2400 with reports suggesting UK PM Johnson could ease lockdown restrictions before May 7th deadline. JPY-crosses are mostly higher on the constructive risk tone although USD/JPY is flat as weakness in safe havens offset each other, while antipodeans are also lifted by the risk appetite which helped AUD/USD reclaim the 0.6400 handle and momentarily pushed NZD/USD above 0.6050 despite the absence of participants in New Zealand for ANZAC Day.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid the gains in stocks and pressure in T-notes but with losses stemmed as prices find a base near 152.50 and ahead of the BoJ policy announcement.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>OVERVIEW</p><p>The Bank of Japan is to conduct a policy meeting today in which the central bank is expected to maintain its QQE with Yield Curve Control and negative rates at -0.10%, although source reports noted the BoJ is to consider a shift to unlimited bond buying from the current JPY 80tln target and may double purchases of corporate bonds as well as commercial paper. The central bank will also provide its latest Outlook Report which will include board members median forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RECENT ACTIONS &amp; COMMENTS</p><p>The BoJ had only announced additional measures at its emergency meeting last month in which it raised purchases of ETFs to JPY 12tln from JPY 6tln and J-REITS to JPY 180bln from JPY 90bln. The central bank also decided to set aside JPY 2tln for more buying of commercial paper and corporate bonds. Since then, BoJ Governor Kuroda has reiterated on several occasions that they will ease without hesitation if necessary and noted they need to support households and firms now so that the economy can stage a V-shaped&nbsp; recovery when the virus is contained, while he also suggested it is possible to further deepen negative rates and boost JGB purchases.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic has also prompted a firm response from the Japanese government which has approved a total of JPY 117.1tln to cushion the impact to the economy and which includes JPY 100k of handouts to all individuals regardless of income which was a shift from initial plans of JPY 300k to every household that suffered a sharp decline in income from the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SOFTENING ECONOMY</p><p>Expectations for further measures have also been supported by the continued deterioration in the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic that has forced Japan to declare a nationwide state of emergency which is currently in place till May 6th. This fallout is evident in the latest trade figures that showed Exports (Mar) Y/Y at -11.7% vs. Exp. -10.1% (Prev. -1.0%) which is the largest decline since 2016, and the latest Tankan survey printed the lowest reading for the Large Manufacturing Index in 7 years of -8, while inflation remains subdued with Core CPI in March softening to 0.4% from 0.6%. In addition, the Japanese government recently cut its economic assessment of the economy amid the pandemic in which it stated the economy is \"worsening rapidly\" and is in an \"extremely severe\" situation with the bleakest assessment in 11 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OUTLOOK REPORT</p><p>The BoJ are also set to release its latest Outlook Report which will include the latest inflation and economic growth forecasts by its policy setters and reports had recently noted that board members were considering lowering economic and price outlooks. However, downward revisions to projections wouldn’t be much of surprise given the current gloomy backdrop and current expectations for sharp contractions to economies worldwide from the coronavirus related disruptions.</p><p>Previous Forecasts</p><p>Real GDP</p><ul><li>Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.8%.</li><li>Fiscal 2020 forecast at 0.8%.</li><li>Fiscal 2021 forecast at 1.1%.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Core CPI</p><ul><li>Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.6%.</li><li>Fiscal 2020 forecast at 1.0%.</li><li>Fiscal 2021 forecast at 1.4%.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT</p><p>There is no exact scheduled time for today’s announcement although the meeting the will begin at 0900 local time (0100BST) which the BoJ hopes to conclude at noon (0400BST). Today’s meeting was also shortened from the central bank’s usual 2-day affair with the change aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus, while focus will be on whether the central bank announces new measures such as unlimited bond buying which could underpin 10yr JGBs and USD/JPY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
