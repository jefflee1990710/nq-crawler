        "content": "<p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US President Trump announced the US will impose a small additional tariff of 10% on the remaining USD 300bln of goods and products coming from China into the US beginning on September 1st. President Trump added that he is taxing China until a deal can be reached and that China President Xi is not moving fast enough although he thinks that Xi wants to make a deal, while he also stated that the latest announced tariffs could be raised to 25%. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>China Global Times editor tweeted that the new tariffs will not bring closer a deal that the US wants and will only make it further away, while he thinks China will no longer give priority to controlling trade war scale and will focus on the national strategy under a prolonged trade war. (Twitter)</p><p>Chinese sources stated that China is not backing down or adding back any of the concession language in the agreement, while China told the USTR the US will have to trust them for enforcement of IP protection. Chinese sources also stated that the Chinese side walked into meetings in Shanghai not ready to make any moves at all which was said to have frustrated US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. In related news, Chinese press reported that the sides offered contrasting views on trade war talks and that contrasting statements from each side suggest that a wider deal to end the trade war is not within reach. (Fox/Twitter/SCMP)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>BoE MPC voted 9-0 in favour of maintaining rates at 0.75% as expected, while it also unanimously voted to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases at GBP 435bln and stock of corporate bonds at GBP 10bln. (Newswires)</p><p>BoE maintained view that on the basis of the assumption of a smooth Brexit and some recovery in global growth (new inclusion), the MPC continues to judge that increases in interest rates, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target, while it added that the response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. BoE also reiterated the view that Q2 growth is expected to be flat and that on the basis of current Brexit assumptions, underlying output growth is expected to be subdued in the near-term although thereafter, GDP expected to accelerate to robust growth rates as Brexit-related uncertainties dissipate.</p><p>BoE Governor Carney said monetary policy response to Brexit is not automatic and could go either way, while he suggested that inflation will rise, GDP growth would slow, GBP would likely fall and that risk premia on UK assets and volatility will increase in the event of a no-deal. Carney added that there are limits to what the BoE can do after a no-deal Brexit and that the MPC does not have a collective view on whether the risk of a cut or hike is symmetric in the event of a no-deal Brexit, while he also stated that it is highly unlikely the BoE will need to take steps to stabilise markets after no-deal Brexit and suggested that easing policy does not make sense now.

Semiconductors names had already been on the back of weak Qualcomm (QCOM) earnings. Cloud computing names, including Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM), were supported Dynatrice (DT) IPO’ed at a significant premium to its initial pricing thoughts, in addition to general risk appetite which supported the wider tech sector. Amazon (AMZN) was supported by the news it plans to purchase a stake in India’s largest brick and mortar retailor, Reliance Industries, although gave away gains later in the session as risk sentiment soured. Myriad Genetics (MYND) shot higher just after the open on the news that that its GeneSight Psychotropic test had received a positive coverage decision at UnitedHealthcare for pharmacogenetic testing with multigene panels, for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder who have failed at least one prior line of therapy. Beyond Meat (BYND) sunk after the co. priced a stock offering; 3.25 million shares at USD 160 each. BlackRock (BLK) was under pressure after the co. pulled out of talks to by a stake in Cofense, a cyber security firm, from private equity firm Pamplona. Notable stocks supported by positive broker moves; Spotify (SPOT) upgraded at Oppenheimer and Crown Castle (CCI) upgraded at JP Morgan. Notable stocks under pressure after negative broker moves; FMC Corp (FMC) downgraded at BAML, US Bancorp (USB) downgraded at Macquarie and Corning Inc (GLW) downgraded at Susquehanna. S&amp;P 500 -0.9% at 2954, NASDAQ-100 -0.6% at 7801, Dow Jones -1% at 26584.</p><p>The T-plex had an exuberant rally amid new China tariffs and disappointing data raising expectations of another Fed rate cut in September, in addition to risk off flows. The bidding got off strongly as the US session commenced following the US July ISM Manufacturing printing 51.2 (exp. 52.0), pulling back on some of the optimism from the PMI Manufacturing data. Treasuries were already firmly higher on the day, but were soon to be doubled as President Trump took to twitter to announce the new 10% tariffs. At settlement, the curve was steeper generally with the 2s30s widening by around 3.5bps, however the very short end was a little flatter. Analysts note that 10-year and 30-year yields posted their lowest levels in nearly 3 years, and futures contracts printed near new contract highs in all but the TYU9. US T-note futures (U9) settled 1-08+ higher at 128-22.</p>",

Prior to the tweets; equity futures had been on the rise, completely rebounding from Wednesday evening’s post FOMC sell off, with poor ISM manufacturing data strengthening the case for more rate cuts. Similar moves were seen in the treasury complex early on; however, the Trump tariff tweets lead to an extension of 10yr T-notes gains whilst the rebound in stocks was reversed. The onset of risk on saw crude futures experience the biggest one-day decline in over four years; the crude complex had already been under pressure after bearish Venezuela news as well as a stronger dollar following the FOMC rate decision. Due to the risk off tone markets saw following Trump tariffs, safe havens caught a bid with USDJPY extending losses and seeing lows of 107.25 and Gold almost hitting 1450.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE:</strong> US President Trump tweeted that from September 1st, US will impose an additional 10% of tariffs on the remaining USD 300bln worth of goods from China. Trump tried to downplay the tariffs by combining the announcement with a positive tone saying talks have been constructive and that he looks forward to continuing positive dialogue with China on a deal and that he feels the future between the two nations will be a very bright one. With the next set of talks scheduled for Washington in September, China’s commerce ministry said both parties will be in intensive contact over August in order to lay down the groundwork for the upcoming meetings. US Secretary of State Pompeo met with China Foreign minister Wang in Bangkok, where there was an “in depth exchange of views” in regards to US &amp; China relations. Pompeo said that when it advances the interests of the US, they will be ready to cooperate with China. On agriculture goods, SCMP stated China and US hold contrasting views as China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed state and private companies have begun buying soybeans, pork and sorghum, despite Trump reiterating China’s lack of purchasing. SCMP wrote that the contrasting statements from each side suggest a wider deal to end the trade war is not within reach and that neither side had any sort of deadline for talks to be completed.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLED USD 4.63 LOWER AT USD 53.95/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLED USD 4.55 LOWER AT USD 60.50/BBL. </strong>The crude complex tumbled heavily on Thursday, with both Brent and WTI posting their largest declines this year, after the announcement of an additional 10% of tariffs on US imports from China. However, the major benchmarks were already under some considerate selling prior to the tariff announcement. It was reported in the WSJ earlier that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the US would be ready to lift sanctions on Venezuela (reimplementing the OPEC member’s crude inventories into the global supply chain) as well as providing aid and investment once incumbent President Maduro is gone; Venezuela’s production has been drifting lower in recent years, currently at 0.7mln bpd vs. 2.4mln bpd in 2016, but the Latin American nation sits on some of the world’s largest oil reserves, and with adequate infrastructure could soon exploit this. Additionally, the recent strong dollar, the lacklustre US-China trade talks, and a disappointing US July ISM Manufacturing (51.2 vs. exp. 52.0) were all providing strong headwinds to the energy markets in the European session, which were then intensified vehemently when US President Trump took to twitter to announce the US would be implementing a fresh round of tariffs on China imports. The market ignored Trump’s comments that recent talks were “constructive” and instead became fearful that an economic headwind for China, the world’s second largest oil consumer, would materialise into global oil demand.</p><p><strong>* US ISM DATA: </strong>ISM Manufacturing PMI came in at 51.2, a three-year low, missing expectations of 52, and falling from previous 51.7. Wells Fargo highlight that although it shows growth remains slightly positive, it is close to stalling out and Capital Economics state it shows the downturn in factory sector has continued into Q3, suggesting the Fed were right to be concerned about slowing global growth seeping into the US economy. Key employment and prices figures also missed expectations and fell from the prior months. The Employment index fell to 51.7 from 54.5 &amp; Prices Paid fell to 45.1 from 47; Wells Fargo note the fall in prices is hinting at a weaker demand. Wells Fargo suggest the poor employment figure will be represented in tomorrow employment report, to show manufacturing payrolls only slightly increasing. New Orders, however, improved from previous rising from 50.0 to 50.8, albeit still rather close to the contractionary zone. Construction spending also adding to the poor report, as it fell 1% short of expectations printing -1.3% and falling from the prior months revised 0.5%. CapEco highlight the cause for the shortfall in spending is driven by a lack of state and local government spending, noting this spending had little contribution to Q2 GDP, and leaves it on track to impact Q3.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>* BOE REVIEW: </strong>As expected, the MPC opted to stand pat on rates at 0.75% via a unanimous decision as the ongoing uncertainty posed by Brexit continues to tie the hands of policymakers. The BoE opted to maintain their view (despite some calls for an adjustment) that the UK will secure a deal with the EU (on the basis that it remains government policy) and thus continued to “assume a smooth adjustment to the average range of possible outcomes for the UK’s eventual trading relationship with the EU”. With this is mind, the MPC also reiterated their existing forward guidance for the rate path (again, despite some calls for an adjustment) which states “increases in interest rates, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target”; note, aside from the ongoing assumption of a smooth Brexit, the MPC now also condition their rate guidance on “some recovery in global growth”. Heading into the release, particular focus had been placed on how the MPC would square their assumption of a smooth Brexit outcome with the market perception that the odds of a no deal outcome are increasing. This posed an issue for policymakers as the accompanying projections in the QIR are based on the implied market rate path and asset prices and thus would contradict the forward guidance of the MPC. Potential solutions included the publication of a constant rate path for the projection horizon or a rate path conditioned on policymakers’ own views. However, the MPC opted to continue to underpin their projections with the market-based rate path and thus markets might opt to play down the importance of the forecasts relative to historical releases. In terms of the projections themselves, 2019 (1.3% vs. Prev. 1.5%) and 2020 (1.3% vs. Prev. 1.6%) annual GDP projections were cut, whilst 2021 (2.3% vs. Prev. 2.1%) was upgraded on the basis that underlying output growth is expected to be subdued in the near-term. Thereafter, GDP is expected to accelerate to robust growth rates as Brexit-related uncertainties dissipate. From an inflation perspective, the 2019 inflation projection (Q3 1.7% vs. Prev. 1.8%) was cut, whilst 2020 (Q3 1.9% vs. Prev. 1.7%) and 2021 (Q3 2.2% vs. Prev. 2.1%) were raised on the assumption that increasing excess demand would lead to firmer domestic inflationary pressures. The accompanying press conference did little to inspire much in the way of price action with Governor Carney outlining the potential impact of a no deal Brexit on the UK economy but reiterating that the government’s current policy is to pursue a deal with Brussels. Overall, today’s meeting was always going to be a difficult one for the MPC to navigate on the basis that economic projections point to higher growth and inflation over a 2-3yr timeframe, which in normal conditions would prompt calls for prospective rate hikes. However, as markets are aware, these are far from normal times and the ongoing cloud posed by Brexit over the UK economy means that policymakers need to see how relations between Westminster and Brussels manifest. That said, as October 31st approaches and a deal is yet to be struck, the Bank’s current guidance will continue to appear increasingly at odds with reality.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* JAPAN &amp; SOUTH KOREA: </strong>Japanese Official said both South Korean and Japanese Foreign Ministers had candid discussions but will have to see whether South Korea will be removed from the “whitelist”. Abe’s team is expected to remove them from the whitelist on August 2nd, which will require Japanese companies to gain approval before exporting ‘sensitive materials’ to South Korea. Which would include most of the machinery and components used for South Korea’s auto and semiconductor production. US Secretary of State Pompeo said he hopes South Korea and Japan will find a path forward to ease tensions, and other officials stated the US is also concerned that deterioration in the Japan/Korea trading relationship could hurt both economies and more if it escalates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* NFP PREVIEW:</strong> US nonfarm payrolls are seen coming in at 164k in July, a reading which would push the three-month average down to 153k from 171k in June. The jobless rate is seen unchanged at 3.7%, though the Conference Board’s consumer confidence data does signal some potential downside. We have seen only a partial slate of business surveys ahead of the NFP report, and they seem to signal some cooling in labour market momentum.

He reiterated cabinet views that the UK will leave the EU on October 31st adding he wants a deal, but notes it has to be different and without a backstop. He added the economy is strong and we can prepare to leave the EU.</p><p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>BoJ Deputy Governor Amamiya said BoJ must closely observe how overseas risks impact Japan's economy and reiterates will take most appropriate action as necessary. Later, Amamiya said like other central banks, BoJ could take policy action to pre-empt risks from materializing. He added that rate cuts, increases in asset purchases and base money expansion are options if BoJ ease or a combination or modification of these can be used.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 1-08+ HIGHER AT 128-22: </strong>The T-plex had an exuberant rally amid new China tariffs and disappointing data raising expectations of another Fed rate cut in September, in addition to risk off flows. The bidding got off strongly as the US session commenced following the US July ISM Manufacturing printing 51.2 (exp. 52.0), pulling back on some of the optimism from the PMI Manufacturing data. Treasuries were already firmly higher on the day, but were soon to be doubled as President Trump took to twitter to announce the new 10% tariffs. At settlement, the curve was steeper generally with the 2s30s widening by around 3.5bps, however the very short end was a little flatter. Analysts note that 10-year and 30-year yields posted their lowest levels in nearly 3 years, and futures contracts printed near new contract highs in all but the TYU9.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iranian President Rouhani said that Iran will prevail, but they are ready for the worst in efforts to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal “with a hard battle ahead”. France said it disagrees with the US’s approach of sanctioning Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and urged for a diplomatic solution in the Gulf. Previously overnight, White House National Security Adviser Bolton confirmed the US will extend the Iran nuclear waivers for a 90-day period, which allows remaining countries involved to continue civil nuclear project participation in Iran.</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>Britain, France, and Germany urged North Korea to engage in meaningful communications with the US, after the European allies convened behind closed doors on Thursday, and also announced that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea's nuclear programme is dismantled. Following the recent missile tests in North Korea, White House National Security Adviser Bolton said the launches did not violate the pledge made by leader Kim Jong-un, but Bolton questioned when working level denuclearization talks would begin, adding that the US is still waiting to hear a time for them.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.9% at 2954, NASDAQ-100 -0.6% at 7801, Dow Jones -1% at 26584, SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary -1.3%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Energy -2.3%, S&amp;P 500 Financials -2.3%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials -2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Materials -0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities 1%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Verizon (VZ) jumped higher premarket after the co. posted strong profits and boosted FY19 guidance, whilst wireless subscribers also topped analyst forecasts. Qualcomm (QCOM) fell sharply premarket after the co. guided lower than street expectation or Q3 earnings and missed on top line Q2 earnings expectations. Kellogg Co. (K) shot higher premarket after the co. posted a healthy beat on both top and bottom lines. Abiomed (ABMD) was the S&amp;P500 underperformer; after the co. cut guidance for FY20. Concho Resources (CXO) also sunk premarket after the co. missed EPS expectations by a fair margin.

However, the major benchmarks were already under some considerate selling prior to the tariff announcement. It was reported in the WSJ earlier that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the US would be ready to lift sanctions on Venezuela (reimplementing the OPEC member’s crude inventories into the global supply chain) as well as providing aid and investment once incumbent President Maduro is gone; Venezuela’s production has been drifting lower in recent years, currently at 0.7mln bpd vs. 2.4mln bpd in 2016, but the Latin American nation sits on some of the world’s largest oil reserves, and with adequate infrastructure could soon exploit this. Additionally, the recent strong dollar, the lacklustre US-China trade talks, and a disappointing US July ISM Manufacturing (51.2 vs. exp. 52.0) were all providing strong headwinds to the energy markets in the European session, which were then intensified vehemently when US President Trump took to twitter to announce the US would be implementing a fresh round of tariffs on China imports. The market ignored Trump’s comments that recent talks were “constructive” and instead became fearful that an economic headwind for China, the world’s second largest oil consumer, would materialise into global oil demand.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The G10 outliers amidst ongoing US Dollar strength on the back of a hawkish Fed rate cut, as no deal Brexit concerns continue to weigh on the Pound above all else. Indeed, Cable only mustered mild and fleeting rebounds through 1.2100 in wake of a headline UK manufacturing PMI beat and BoE minutes maintaining gradual and limited tightening in the event of a smooth departure from the EU as the MPC’s baseline scenario before slipping to fresh multi-year lows circa 1.2080, while Eur/Gbp traded in the opposite direction between 0.9133-01 parameters even though the single currency was not immune to the Buck’s advances. Similarly, the Loonie retreated further from post-Canadian GDP peaks even though the manufacturing PMI marginally reclaimed 50+ status, with supply touted between 1.3230-40 soaked up and Usd/Cad almost reaching 1.3250 against the backdrop of sliding crude prices. Conversely, the Yen extended its rebound from 109.30 or so lows and comfortably through 2 bn option expiries from 109.10 to 109.00 well before the NY cut as the US Treasury curve flipped from bear-steepening to bull-flattening and the benchmark 10 year yield slipped back below 2%. Usd/Jpy subsequently fell under 108.50 and towards 108.15 as the <strong>DXY</strong> eased back towards 98.603 lows vs 98.941 highs on a weaker than forecast US manufacturing ISM.</p><p><strong>AUD/CHF/NZD/EUR</strong></p><p>All down vs the Greenback, albeit to varying degrees as the Aussie staved off another attempt to flush out bids/support ahead of 0.6825, but struggled to breach the first line of resistance above 0.6850 at 0.6860-65, while the Franc straddled 0.9950 and 1.1000 vs the Euro in lighter trade due to Swiss National Day, though wary that the SNB would still be watching currency market developments closely. Back down under, the Kiwi kept its recovery momentum within a 0.6535-68 range as the Aud/Nzd cross meandered between 1.0454-31 ahead of more pre-RBNZ pointers in the form of labour data just 48 hours before August’s policy meeting next Thursday. The single currency benefited to an extent from the post-ISM Dollar pullback as Eur/Usd bounced off new ytd lows close to 1.1025 towards best levels of 1.1080, largely shrugging aside mixed Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and more Italian political angst as League Deputy PM Salvini said his party will not back the 2020 budget without big tax cuts.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Lira, Real and Rand as Usd/Try stayed mostly below 5.6000 even though Turkey’s manufacturing PMI contracted faster on the wave of inflation optimism via the CBRT, while Usd/Brl contained post-FOMC/COPOM gains to 3.8360 and a brief test of the 200 DMA. However, Usd/Zar shot up through 14.5000 awaiting the official SA ratings review from Moody’s after the agency warned about the adverse impact of increased aid to Eskom.</p>",

Major bourses are mixed with the FTSE 100 (Unch) faring slightly worse as its oil giant Shell (-4.6%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 as the Co’s profits plunged on lower oil prices. This, coupled with an uninspiring energy complex sees the EU energy sector significantly underperforming, whilst other sectors (ex-materials) are broadly in positive territory. Notable movers today are largely on the back of earnings, with Altice (+23.7%), Capita (+21.0%), SocGen (+4.5%) and Standard Chartered (+4.5%) all bolstered by optimistic numbers. On the flip side, Barclays (-3.2%) is hit on a profit miss, while Siemens (-4.3%) narrowed its EBITA forecast and now sees it at the lower end of the previously guided range. Miners also took a hit from the FOMC-triggered downside in the metals complex. Finally, a special dividend announcement from Rio Tinto (-2.4%) did little to support their share price this morning.</p><p>FX</p><p>USD - The Dollar is broadly firmer in wake of the FOMC and relatively hawkish guidance to accompany the 25 bp ease. The decision to cut rates was not unanimous and Fed Chair Powell stressed that the move was different to previous policy loosening heralding the start of a lengthy cycle by framing the reduction as a mid-cycle adjustment, albeit adding that it is not necessarily a case of ‘one and done’. Nevertheless, the markets were hoping for more and the index rallied to a new 2019 peak at 98.941 before losing momentum ahead of Friday’s NFP that may be pivotal for the rest of the year in terms of policy action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK - Relative outperformers or at least recovering some lost ground, as the Aussie found support near early Feb 2016 lows around 0.6827 vs its US counterpart and has subsequently bounced to 0.6850+, while the Kiwi rebounded from 0.6535 to reclaim 0.6560+ status. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns are both benefiting from technical retracements against the Euro and seemingly independent of contrasting manufacturing PMIs given a bad Norwegian miss and sub-50 print vs firmer than forecast Swedish headline that was only partly offset by less upbeat components. Indeed, Eur/Nok is back down below 9.8000 and Eur/Sek under 10.7000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GBP/EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF - The Pound has also largely shrugged off a better than expected UK manufacturing PMI amidst ongoing and increasing no deal Brexit risk as output hit circa 7 year lows and attention shifts to BoE super Thursday and the prospect of a more dovish/downbeat tone to the MPC minutes, QIR and Governor Carney presser. Indeed, Cable has now lost grip of the 1.2100 handle and Eur/Gbp is eyeing 0.9130 ahead of high noon and the 12.30BST news conference – full preview available via the Research Suite and Headline Feed. Mixed Eurozone manufacturing surveys have not really impacted the single currency either as Eur/Usd hovers towards the base of a 1.1080-33 range, while the Yen has regrouped from 109.30 lows to probe resistance at 109.00 and hefty option expiry interest from the big figure to 109.10 in 2 bn. Elsewhere, the Loonie has handed back all and more of its post-Canadian GDP data gains and is looking at offers said to be stacked between 1.3230-40, with the Franc pivoting 0.9950 and 1.1000 against the Euro.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EM - Amidst pronounced depreciation vs the Greenback, Turkey’s Lira has bucked the trend on further positive follow through from the latest CBRT inflation report and outlook, with Usd/Try remaining south of 5.6000 and hardly reacting to a more contractionary manufacturing PMI.

Major bourses are mixed with the FTSE 100 (Unch) faring slightly worse as its oil giant Shell (-4.6%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 as the Co’s profits plunged on lower oil prices. This, coupled with an uninspiring energy complex sees the EU energy sector significantly underperforming, whilst other sectors (ex-materials) are broadly in positive territory. Notable movers today are largely on the back of earnings, with Altice (+23.7%), Capita (+21.0%), SocGen (+4.5%) and Standard Chartered (+4.5%) all bolstered by optimistic numbers. On the flip side, Barclays (-3.2%) is hit on a profit miss, while Siemens (-4.3%) narrowed its EBITA forecast and now sees it at the lower end of the previously guided range. Miners also took a hit from the FOMC-triggered downside in the metals complex. Finally, a special dividend announcement from Rio Tinto (-2.4%) did little to support their share price this morning.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar is broadly firmer in wake of the FOMC and relatively hawkish guidance to accompany the 25 bp ease. The decision to cut rates was not unanimous and Fed Chair Powell stressed that the move was different to previous policy loosening heralding the start of a lengthy cycle by framing the reduction as a mid-cycle adjustment, albeit adding that it is not necessarily a case of ‘one and done’. Nevertheless, the markets were hoping for more and the index rallied to a new 2019 peak at 98.941 before losing momentum ahead of Friday’s NFP that may be pivotal for the rest of the year in terms of policy action.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong> - Relative outperformers or at least recovering some lost ground, as the Aussie found support near early Feb 2016 lows around 0.6827 vs its US counterpart and has subsequently bounced to 0.6850+, while the Kiwi rebounded from 0.6535 to reclaim 0.6560+ status. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns are both benefiting from technical retracements against the Euro and seemingly independent of contrasting manufacturing PMIs given a bad Norwegian miss and sub-50 print vs firmer than forecast Swedish headline that was only partly offset by less upbeat components. Indeed, Eur/Nok is back down below 9.8000 and Eur/Sek under 10.7000.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF</strong> - The Pound has also largely shrugged off a better than expected UK manufacturing PMI amidst ongoing and increasing no deal Brexit risk as output hit circa 7 year lows and attention shifts to BoE super Thursday and the prospect of a more dovish/downbeat tone to the MPC minutes, QIR and Governor Carney presser. Indeed, Cable has now lost grip of the 1.2100 handle and Eur/Gbp is eyeing 0.9130 ahead of high noon and the 12.03BST news conference – full preview available via the Research Suite and Headline Feed. Mixed Eurozone manufacturing surveys have not really impacted the single currency either as Eur/Usd hovers towards the base of a 1.1080-33 range, while the Yen has regrouped from 109.30 lows to probe resistance at 109.00 and hefty option expiry interest from the big figure to 109.10 in 2 bn. Elsewhere, the Loonie has handed back all and more of its post-Canadian GDP data gains and is looking at offers said to be stacked between 1.3230-40, with the Franc pivoting 0.9950 and 1.1000 against the Euro.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Amidst pronounced depreciation vs the Greenback, Turkey’s Lira has bucked the trend on further positive follow through from the latest CBRT inflation report and outlook, with Usd/Try remaining south of 5.6000 and hardly reacting to a more contractionary manufacturing PMI. However, the Real may underperform after a bigger than anticipated 50 bp BCB rate cut from a 3.8130 close post-FOMC.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have rebounds strongly from fresh post-UK PMI Liffe intraday lows and just notched a new, albeit marginal contract high at 133.08 (+1/4 point on the day vs -16 ticks at one stage) as Sterling continues its slide and the clock ticks down to the BoE. Similarly, Short Sterling futures have bounced a bit further from worst levels to stand 2.5 ticks ahead at best in contrast to core counterparts that remain relatively capped in wake of the ‘hawkish’ Fed. Back to bonds, <strong>Bunds</strong> are flirting with parity at 175.09, but off yesterday’s 175.28 best and the <strong>US Treasury</strong> curve is still softer/steeper albeit less pronounced ahead of claims, manufacturing PMI and ISM.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The energy complex remains subdued in the after-math of the disappointing FOMC forward guidance issued yesterday. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures have since traded sideways below 58.00/bbl and 64.50/bbl respectively with little by way of fresh catalysts.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is broadly firmer in wake of the FOMC and relatively hawkish guidance to accompany the 25 bp ease. The decision to cut rates was not unanimous and Fed Chair Powell stressed that the move was different to previous policy loosening heralding the start of a lengthy cycle by framing the reduction as a mid-cycle adjustment, albeit adding that it is not necessarily a case of ‘one and done’. Nevertheless, the markets were hoping for more and the index rallied to a new 2019 peak at 98.941 before losing momentum ahead of Friday’s NFP that may be pivotal for the rest of the year in terms of policy action.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Relative outperformers or at least recovering some lost ground, as the Aussie found support near early Feb 2016 lows around 0.6827 vs its US counterpart and has subsequently bounced to 0.6850+, while the Kiwi rebounded from 0.6535 to reclaim 0.6560+ status. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns are both benefiting from technical retracements against the Euro and seemingly independent of contrasting manufacturing PMIs given a bad Norwegian miss and sub-50 print vs firmer than forecast Swedish headline that was only partly offset by less upbeat components. Indeed, Eur/Nok is back down below 9.8000 and Eur/Sek under 10.7000.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound has also largely shrugged off a better than expected UK manufacturing PMI amidst ongoing and increasing no deal Brexit risk as output hit circa 7 year lows and attention shifts to BoE super Thursday and the prospect of a more dovish/downbeat tone to the MPC minutes, QIR and Governor Carney presser. Indeed, Cable has now lost grip of the 1.2100 handle and Eur/Gbp is eyeing 0.9130 ahead of high noon and the 12.03BST news conference – full preview available via the Research Suite and Headline Feed. Mixed Eurozone manufacturing surveys have not really impacted the single currency either as Eur/Usd hovers towards the base of a 1.1080-33 range, while the Yen has regrouped from 109.30 lows to probe resistance at 109.00 and hefty option expiry interest from the big figure to 109.10 in 2 bn. Elsewhere, the Loonie has handed back all and more of its post-Canadian GDP data gains and is looking at offers said to be stacked between 1.3230-40, with the Franc pivoting 0.9950 and 1.1000 against the Euro.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Amidst pronounced depreciation vs the Greenback, Turkey’s Lira has bucked the trend on further positive follow through from the latest CBRT inflation report and outlook, with Usd/Try remaining south of 5.6000 and hardly reacting to a more contractionary manufacturing PMI. However, the Real may underperform after a bigger than anticipated 50 bp BCB rate cut from a 3.8130 close post-FOMC.</p>",

However, the question remains whether the latter delivers more than a conventional rate cut in contrast to the FOMC that provided insurance via its 25 bp ease, but failed to signal any more stimulus at this stage. Back to Eurex, Bunds are hovering just under 175.00 and early peaks of 175.04 as peripheral paper and semi-core bonds underperforms ahead of multi-tranche Spanish and French supply.</p>",

The Fed also cited implications of global developments for the US outlook as well as muted inflation pressures and stated that spending growth has picked up but business fixed investment growth has been soft and inflation compensation measures remain low.</p><p><strong>- Fed's Chair Powell commented at the press conference that the outlook to the economy remains favourable and the rate cut is to foster faster return to 2% inflation target</strong>, while he added that weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty and muted inflation has concerned the Fed. <strong>Powell also stated that the rate cut is a mid-cycle policy adjustment and that the current rate decision is different from the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle</strong>, while he answered increasing policy support this year has kept the economy on track when asked if a 25bps cut is sufficient to return inflation to target, <strong>but later added he did not say that today's cut is going to be the start of a cycle of \"just one\" rate cut</strong>.</p><p><strong>- Market reaction to the decision and statement was choppy as the 25bps cut was expected, while it maintained its language to ‘act as appropriate’ to sustain the expansion</strong> and pledged to continue monitoring incoming information in their decision making. <strong>This was framed by analysts as a neutral cut since language has been maintained that the Fed can cut further if it needs to but there was not any explicit pledge to do so</strong>, while news that the balance sheet normalisation plan would end early was seen as dovish for the Treasury complex. However, <strong>Powell stated at the press conference that the move was a “mid-cycle adjustment” and that there was an ‘insurance’ aspect to the cut</strong>, while he also added that today’s rate decision was different to the start of a lengthy cutting cycle and continued to sound upbeat through the presser which triggered a hawkish reaction, <strong>although he later noted that he had not said that the rate decision will be a cycle of ‘just one’ rate cut</strong> which raised the possibility of further insurance cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian stocks traded lacklustre as the region reacted to the FOMC meeting</strong>. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.2%)</strong> were lower with notable weakness seen in gold miners after the precious metal slumped post-FOMC, although downside in Australia’s broader market was limited by resilience in its largest weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark briefly turned positive as it found solace from a weaker currency and amid a heavy slate of earnings. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%)</strong> conformed to the downbeat picture after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again and participants digested more PMI data in which Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI topped estimates but remained below the 50 benchmark level, while there was also increasing concerns regarding the Chinese military intervening in Hong Kong. Conversely, participants had their first opportunity to react to the more constructive tone struck between US and China in trade talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower and tracked the weakness seen in USTs following the less dovish than expected Fed, with further pressure seen after the 10yr auction results which attracted weaker demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

As such, the greenback’s major counterparts were weaker across the board with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> firmly below the 1.1100 handle and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> pressured before downside was stemmed by support at the 1.2100 level, although the currency remains lacklustre as the UK ramps up its no-deal contingencies and with the government believing it can strike a series of quick side deals in the event of a no-deal Brexit once EU countries feel the disruption. Elsewhere, upside in <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was exacerbated on a break above 109.00, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were subdued in the aftermath of the Fed and due to the lacklustre risk tone as well as declines across the commodities complex.</p><p><strong>Brazil Central Bank Selic Rate 6.00% vs. Exp. 6.25% (Prev. 6.50%), with the decision unanimous.</strong> (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were lower across the board in which <strong>WTI</strong> slipped back below the USD 58.00/bbl level as a firmer USD and broad risk averse tone overshadowed this week’s bullish inventories and reports of lower OPEC output, while Brent crude tested USD 64.00/bbl to the downside and yesterday also saw the expiry of its August futures. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> slumped amid a surge in the greenback following the FOMC disappointment and <strong>copper</strong> languished alongside the uninspiring picture in stocks and across the commodities complex.</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US imposed sanctions on Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif</strong>, while Iran Foreign Minister Zarif said the US sanctioned him because he is Iran's primary spokesperson around the world and that the sanctions have no impact for him or his family as he does not have foreign property or interests. Furthermore, Zarif thanked the US for sanctioning him and considering him a considerable threat to its agenda. (Twitter)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The US treasury curve bull flattened with the 2s30s narrowing by around 10bp after the fed’s decision to trim rates by 25bp. The T complex saw a specifically bullish catalyst as the balance sheet tapering was to finish 2 months early with some analysts suggesting the fed could purchase up to USD 35-40bln of additional treasuries over the next 2 months. Looking through to the end of the year markets now price 35bp of easing (before the 25bp cut decision 68bp of easing was priced) as pricing becomes a bit more hawkish prior to the meeting. US T-note futures (U9) settled 2+ ticks higher at 127-13+.</p><p><strong>US President Trump tweeted that what the market wanted to hear was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle</strong>, while he suggested Fed Chair Powell let us down as usual but at least he is ending quantitative tightening. Furthermore, Trump later added that experts stated Fed should not have tightened and waited too long to undo the mistake, while he added that Fed’s Bullard said they waited too long to correct the mistake made in December.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade lacklustre as the region reacts to the FOMC meeting where the Fed cut rates by 25bps as expected, but disappointed expectations for more dovish signals and instead opted for a neutral tone in which it maintained its language to ‘act as appropriate’ to sustain the expansion and Fed Chair Powell suggested the decision was different from the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are lower with notable weakness seen in gold miners after the precious metal slumped post-FOMC, although downside in Australia’s broader market is limited by resilience in its largest weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark briefly turned positive as it finds solace from a weaker currency and amid a heavy slate of earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) conform to the weakness after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again and as participants digest more PMI data in which Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI topped estimates but remained below the 50 benchmark level, while there is also increasing concerns regarding the Chinese military intervening in Hong Kong. Conversely, there has been a more amicable tone regarding US-China trade talks which were described as constructive, efficient and will be followed up by discussions in Washington in September and working level meetings as early as this month.</p><p>In FX markets, USD seems to be the only game in town and has continued to strengthen in the wake of the disappointment from the Fed’s ‘neutral cut’ which saw markets price in a 55% chance for rates to be held at the September meeting and prompted further criticism from US President Trump who suggested that the market wanted to hear this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle and that Fed Chair Powell let us down as usual. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts are weaker across the board with EUR/USD firmly below the 1.1100 handle and with GBP/USD pressured before downside was stemmed by support at the 1.2100 level although the currency remains lacklustre as the UK ramps up its no-deal contingencies and with the government believing it can strike a series of quick side deals in the event of a no-deal Brexit once EU countries feel the disruption. Elsewhere, upside in USD/JPY was exacerbated on a break above 109.00, while antipodeans are lacklustre in the aftermath of the Fed and due to the lacklustre risk tone as well as declines across the commodities complex.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower and track the weakness seen in USTs following the less dovish than expected Fed, with participants also sidelined ahead of a 10yr auction later.&nbsp;</p>",
