Trump added that it is possible to reach a deal with Chinese President Xi at the G20 summit and avoid the need for further tariffs but also suggested he is happy where things are now, while he later stated that his plan B with China is to reduce business with them. (Newswires/Fox Business)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that the US-China trade deal is 90% complete although some later suggested that Mnuchin said we were 90% done and was speaking in the past tense. In related news, US Commerce Secretary Ross said US President Trump and Chinese President Xi will hopefully put trade talks back on track and that the US is looking for a \"reasonable\" trade deal with China. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times Editor suggested that with dozens of hours left before Xi-Trump summit, Chinese state media has continued to criticize the US harshly which is a situation that never happened previously and that no Chinese official now speaks with such optimism referring to comments by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. (Newswires)</p><p>China's State Council said it will fine tune monetary policy in a preemptive way but keeping it prudent and will roll out measures to cut financing costs for smaller firms, as well as keep liquidity reasonably ample. The State Councill will also deepen market-based interest rate reform and improve commercial banks' lending rate pricing mechanism, while it added that financial institutions are to issue more than CNY 180bln in bonds this year to make loans to smaller firms. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EU</strong></p><p>BoE Governor Carney said BoE forecasts do not include the no-deal Brexit risk which is baked into market interest rate forecasts and that no-deal risk has pushed down market path for rates, while he added that it is more likely they will provide stimulus than tightening after a no-deal. Carney also commented that the BoE will change its forecasts if the government's Brexit policy changes and that monetary policy has \"somewhat limited abilities\" to offset drag from trade tensions. (Newswires)</p><p>Italian PM Conte expects to make progress on the budget deal with EU in talks with Juncker over the G20 meeting. In addition, a government source said they will cut 2019 deficit close to 2% but are unlikely to set a new 2020 target, while the source added they are to pledge to cut spending and scrap tax breaks for 2020 and will find other funding to avoid increasing sales tax.

Furthermore, Trump commented that it is fine with him if there is no deal with Iran and that he has unlimited time. (Newswires/Fox)</p><p>Iran’s envoy told the UN Security Council that it will not endure the burdens of preserving the nuclear deal and stated that the deal is in a critical condition if remaining participants don't take steps to preserve it, they must accept full responsibility for any consequences. The envoy added the US offer of talks cannot be trusted as long as illegal sanctions remain in place.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>US President Trump said other countries have devalued their currencies and the US cannot because of Fed policy, while he added that Powell is not doing a good job and does not do anything for the US as other countries devalue. Furthermore, Trump said Fed policy is \"insane\" and that the ECB is pouring money in whilst the Fed is taking money out, while he also commented that that he has the right to demote or fire Powell but has never suggested he would. (Fox Business News)</p><p>Fed's Daly (Non-Voter, Dove) said signs of persistent inflation drag would be concerning and might require policy makers to do more, while she noted that it is possible inflation expectations are drifting lower. Daly also commented the US economy is strong and tighter than it has been in a while but there might be more to run and that efforts to get inflation back to target could be appropriate, while the next few weeks will provide clarity on whether or not more stimulus is needed.

The positive effect from Micron helped to raise confidence in a H2 recovery for chipmakers, as such the SOX Index of semiconductors jumped higher. Notable other gainers within the index were Western Digital Corp (WDC), who received an upgrade to buy at Craig-Hallum, and Nvidia Corp (NVDA). The utilities, consumer staples and health care sectors came under pressure, trader chatter suggesting month/quarter end factors could have been at play, as well as the outperformance of “riskier” sectors such as information technology and consumer discretionary in line with wider market risk on. Chinese hackers reportedly targeted a number of major computer service providers, including IBM (IBM), HPE (HPE) and DXC (DXC). Apple (AAPL) also moved higher, buoyed by the news that the technology co had acquired <a href=\"http://drive.ai/\">Drive.ai</a>, an autonomous driving start up. Boeing (BA) shares saw some upside on reports alleged the aircraft maker is in talks with airline customers over possible reimbursements for 737 MAX grounding. FedEx (FDX) moved as earnings beat expectations, with analysts saying earnings were “no worse than feared”. Beyond Meat (BYND) rose after the co. announced plans to roll-out a new plant-based ‘ground beef’ product across the US. Corteva (CTVA) jumped higher on the announcement of a USD 1bln share buyback programme and payed its first dividend since being spun off by DowDuPont. IHS Markit (INFO) caught a bid after the after earnings. Kinder Morgan (KMI) was supported after news emerged that the co. will be able to begin building a USD 2bln natural gas pipeline without having get the Texas energy regulator to approve its proposed route, due to a state judge ruling. Tobacco names, including Altria group (MO) and Phillip Morris (PM) were under pressure after the San Francisco City Council opted to ban e-cigarettes. General Mills (GIS) sunk after the co. reported earnings that missed on the top line and guided lower than expectations. Xcel Energy (XEL) shares were under pressure after a federal report cast doubt over the co.’s plans to replace two of its coal energy plants with wind, solar and battery storage units, called the Colorado Energy Plan. Notable shares benefitting from upgrades; ConocoPhillips (COP) upgraded at Mizuho, Western Digital Corp (WDC) upgraded at Craig-Hallum, AbbVie (ABBV) upgraded at SVB Leerink. Notable shares suffering after downgrades; Rollins Inc (ROL) downgraded at Stifel, State Street (STT) downgraded at UBS. S&amp;P 500 -0.1% AT 2914, NASDAQ-100 0.5% AT 7627, DJIA&nbsp; 0% AT 26539.</p><p>The TPLEX was on the backfoot as the market digested comments made by FOMC participants on Tuesday, where there seemed to be no urgency to cut rates by a 50bps magnitude, and officials preferring to evaluate multiple factors before settling on a rate cut. There was some downside in premarket trade, with a news organisation mis-quoting US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin (the headline suggested a trade deal with China was 90% done, although Mnuchin was referring to the agreement being 90% complete before talks between US/China broke off); there was buying action that followed from players who had identified the misquote. Analysts also attributed the miss in the durable goods data to some selling, too. US President Trump’s wide-ranging interview reiterated familiar themes (and risks) and led to a few positive ticks in the TPLEX. A mediocre 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps; direct bidders took the most since February, leaving dealers with the smallest share since February as well, the yield was the lowest at a 5s auction since August 2017. The US concludes the week’s supply with an auction of 7s on Thursday. The last two 7-year note auctions have tailed, the last by a chunky 1.9bps on soft cover. The latest positioning data indicates dealers were long in the 6-7 year sector to the tune of around USD 22.6bln, a higher amount than the previous auction cycle, which could be a negative for the auction. SocGen’s analysts hold a slight negative going into the auction; the bank argued that the 7-year sector was trading rich vs 5s and 10s, and is trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The WI yield is also trading beneath all other stop out rates since October 2016, and SocGen says concession will therefore be needed heading into the auction. US T-note futures (U9) settled 17 ticks lower at 127-19</p>",

Trump suggested that it was possible to reach a deal with China on trade at this week’s G20, and he also confirmed remarks from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, who again stated that before talks broke off, negotiators were 90% there on a deal. There wasn’t much new on the Iran front in the interview, though the President reiterated he did not want war with the nation, but if there was any military conflict, he warned it would not last long. Trump reiterated familiar criticisms of the Fed and its Chair Powell, and also aimed at big tech names FB, GOOG, TWTR, threatening to legislate to improve competition within the sector; while also taking a swipe at Bank of America’s (BAC) research.</p><p>* <strong>TRADE WARS:</strong> Desks have been digesting Tuesday’s report that suggests that the US is willing to hold-off tariffs on the remaining USD 300bln of Chinese imports, and are prepared to resume negotiations with China. While the report is another sign of a softening of the US approach ahead of the G20, reports also state that the US is not willing to provide concessions on trade, keeping the chances of progress limited.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> Not much in the way of easing conditions between Washington and Tehran on Wednesday, with further punchy comments from both sides. US President Trump said in a Fox Business interview that Iran’s leadership is not smart, reiterating his preference for no war, but caveating that if there was a war it would not last long. The Iranian UN Envoy said that US offers for talks cannot be trusted as long as sanctions remain in place; maybe worth highlighting that previously, Iran’s Foreign Minister Zarif said that the option of diplomacy had closed permanently. Trump later said that he is fine with there being no deal with Iran, he has unlimited time. In regard to the nuclear pact, the Iranian envoy told the UN Security Council that it will not endure the burdens of preserving the deal, and the deal is in a critical condition if remaining participants don't take steps to preserve it, warning that they must accept full responsibility for any consequences.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS: </strong>As was widely flagged in advance, the headline was dragged lower on the back of Boeing failing to secure any orders in May, with the headline -1.3% (consensus was looking for -0.1%). Capital Economics says that this suggests that business equipment investment was not quite as soft as had been feared in Q2: \"The decline in headline orders was principally due to a 28.2% M/M fall in commercial aircraft orders, that’s bad enough, but that number, which is supposed to be net of cancellations, still doesn’t reflect the large number of order cancellations that Boeing has reported in the past couple of months.\" The consultancy says we should expect more declines over the summer. The core metric, meanwhile, rose 0.3%, beating expectations, and shipments of non-defence capital goods ex-aircraft, which feeds into the equipment investment component in the GDP report, increased by 0.7% M/M in May, which could signal that equipment investment growth could be closer to 5% annualised, Capital Economics says (it was previously looking for around zero).</p><p><strong>* US GOODS TRADE BALANCE:</strong> The US goods trade deficit widened by more than was expected (USD 74.5bln vs USD 70.9bln seen in April). Total trade was up in May, with exports rising in line with imports. \"Still, momentum remains subdued with exports down 2.3% Y/Y, lagging import growth of 3% Y/Y,\" Oxford Economics says, \"the global growth soft patch and protectionist trade policies are constraining exports, while import growth is easing in line with the domestic economy in 2019.\"</p><p><strong>* G20 DRAFT COMMUNIQUE:</strong> G20 leaders will call for the promotion of free trade to achieve strong global growth,&nbsp;as the United States and China seek to resume talks to resolve their bitter trade dispute, Japan’s Asahi reported. The statement will highlight the promotion of free trade and technological innovation as two of the key drivers of the global economy, Asahi said, it also stresses the importance for nations of the grouping to create a positive cycle so that the benefits of solid growth are distributed broadly.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ:</strong> The RBNZ left its OCR unchanged at 1.50% as expected, albeit the statement seemingly ramped up the prospect of further OCR reductions ahead. “Given the weaker global economic outlook and the risk of ongoing subdued domestic growth, a lower OCR may be needed”, the statement noted, meanwhile the minutes showed that “members agreed that more support from monetary policy was likely to be necessary.” The dovish message appears to be driven mostly by global developments, Goldman Sachs said, citing weaker trading-partner growth, trade tensions, dovish shift by global central banks and the associated upward pressure on the NZD. The overall tone of the statement has prompted analysts to now expect cuts in at the 7th August policy meeting, with money markets now pricing in around a 75% chance of an OCR cut. “We suspect the domestic and global economic activity will continue to disappoint in 2019,” Capital Economics said, and it sees a cut in August, followed by another in November.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> Testimony that featured Governor Carney, Cunliffe, Saunders, Tenreyro didn’t provide much by way of new information, which isn’t too surprising since it was regarding the May QIR, and since then, we have had another BOE rate decision. Carney said BoE forecasts do not include the no-deal Brexit risk, which is baked into market interest rate forecasts, and no-deal risks have pushed down market path for rates; he said it was more likely the BOE would provide stimulus rather than tightening after a no-deal exit. Carney also said the BOE will change its forecasts if UK government's Brexit policy changes, and that monetary Policy has \"somewhat limited abilities\" to offset drag from trade tensions.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.1% AT 2914, NASDAQ-100 0.5% AT 7627, DOW JONES&nbsp; 0% AT 26539. </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; -1.4%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; 1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; -1.3%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; 1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; -2.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Micron (MU) shares jumped higher after the co. reported strong earnings, saying it can lawfully resume shipping a certain subset of products to Huawei and said that it has mitigated 90% of China tariff impact. The positive effect from Micron helped to raise confidence in a H2 recovery for chipmakers, as such the SOX Index of semiconductors jumped higher. Notable other gainers within the index were Western Digital Corp (WDC), who received an upgrade to buy at Craig-Hallum, and Nvidia Corp (NVDA). The utilities, consumer staples and health care sectors came under pressure, trader chatter suggesting month/quarter end factors could have been at play, as well as the outperformance of “riskier” sectors such as information technology and consumer discretionary in line with wider market risk on. Chinese hackers reportedly targeted a number of major computer service providers, including IBM (IBM), HPE (HPE) and DXC (DXC). Apple (AAPL) also moved higher, buoyed by the news that the technology co had acquired Drive.ai, an autonomous driving start up. Boeing (BA) shares saw some upside on reports alleged the aircraft maker is in talks with airline customers over possible reimbursements for 737 MAX grounding. FedEx (FDX) moved as earnings beat expectations, with analysts saying earnings were “no worse than feared”. Beyond Meat (BYND) rose after the co. announced plans to roll-out a new plant-based ‘ground beef’ product across the US. Corteva (CTVA) jumped higher on the announcement of a USD 1bln share buyback programme and payed its first dividend since being spun off by DowDuPont. IHS Markit (INFO) caught a bid after the after earnings. Kinder Morgan (KMI) was supported after news emerged that the co. will be able to begin building a USD 2bln natural gas pipeline without having get the Texas energy regulator to approve its proposed route, due to a state judge ruling. Tobacco names, including Altria group (MO) and Phillip Morris (PM) were under pressure after the San Francisco City Council opted to ban e-cigarettes. General Mills (GIS) sunk after the co. reported earnings that missed on the top line and guided lower than expectations. Xcel Energy (XEL) shares were under pressure after a federal report cast doubt over the co.’s plans to replace two of its coal energy plants with wind, solar and battery storage units, called the Colorado Energy Plan. Notable shares benefitting from upgrades; ConocoPhillips (COP) upgraded at Mizuho, Western Digital Corp (WDC) upgraded at Craig-Hallum, AbbVie (ABBV) upgraded at SVB Leerink. Notable shares suffering after downgrades; Rollins Inc (ROL) downgraded at Stifel, State Street (STT) downgraded at UBS.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLES USD 1.55 HIGHER AT USD 59.38; BRENT (Q9) SETTLES USD 1.44 HIGHER AT USD 66.49. </strong>Crude markets moved decisively higher on Wednesday on the back of some chunky drawdowns in US energy inventories. The complex was already on the front foot going into the day following the forecast beating 7.5mln bbl API reported draw in crude stocks, before being cemented by the EIA official report printing a multi year record draw of 12.8mln bbls; both the products reported surprise draws with weekly production falling again to 12.1mln BPD, and Cushing stocks drawing just shy of 2mln bbls. The EIA also reported crude exports reaching a record high of 3.8mln BPD, with imports falling by 1.2mln BPD, this echoes the narrative of US energy independence as well as a pick up in US crude demand due to the geopolitical risks associated with supply out of the Persian Gulf. Separately, the announcement that the Philadelphia gasoline refinery (which oversees a large amount of gasoline supply to the US east coast) that exploded last week is expected to close permanently has been supportive of RBOB gasoline futures, which has likely been providing support to the wider energy sector.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 17 TICKS LOWER AT 127-19:</strong> The TPLEX was on the backfoot as the market digested comments made by FOMC participants on Tuesday, where there seemed to be no urgency to cut rates by a 50bps magnitude, and officials preferring to evaluate multiple factors before settling on a rate cut. There was some downside in premarket trade, with a news organisation mis-quoting US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin (the headline suggested a trade deal with China was 90% done, although Mnuchin was referring to the agreement being 90% complete before talks between US/China broke off); there was buying action that followed from players who had identified the misquote. Analysts also attributed the miss in the durable goods data to some selling, too. US President Trump’s wide-ranging interview reiterated familiar themes (and risks) and led to a few positive ticks in the TPLEX. A mediocre 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps; direct bidders took the most since February, leaving dealers with the smallest share since February as well, the yield was the lowest at a 5s auction since August 2017. The US concludes the week’s supply with an auction of 7s on Thursday. The last two 7-year note auctions have tailed, the last by a chunky 1.9bps on soft cover. The latest positioning data indicates dealers were long in the 6-7 year sector to the tune of around USD 22.6bln, a higher amount than the previous auction cycle, which could be a negative for the auction. SocGen’s analysts hold a slight negative going into the auction; the bank argued that the 7-year sector was trading rich vs 5s and 10s, and is trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The WI yield is also trading beneath all other stop out rates since October 2016, and SocGen says concession will therefore be needed heading into the auction.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> Buck higher for a second day, as the market digests the less dovish than expected Fedspeak on Tuesday, after Fed officials on Tuesday leaned-back on the notion of an aggressive 50bps rate cut at the July meeting. Commerzbank suggests that in the medium-term, the size of the rate cut is not as important for the buck. “If for example the Fed were to cut its key rate by 25bps on 31st July but announce in no uncertain terms that a further step was to follow at the 18th September meeting, the effect would be similar to an immediate 50bps step,” Commerz argues, “but of course both alternatives would constitute a stronger signal than a ‘small’ step, not because 0.25 ppts more carry/less carry will make a big difference, but because a large step would illustrate that the Fed is in a hurry, thus increasing the likelihood that there is more to come than the market is expecting at present.” Commerzbank says the more important consideration is why the FOMC is cutting, which says more about how much more there is yet to come.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The EUR short-squeeze has abated, helped by less-dovish-than-expected Fedspeak (per Powell and Bullard on Tuesday), some technicians thinks the 1.14 level may prove to be a short-term top ahead of the G20; the next move will likely be catalysed by the outcome of Trump/Xi talks over the weekend. EUR has today remained sub the figure. However, Credit Suisse says that after the buck strength on Tuesday, it sees FX moves as “expectations management/cleanse of short-term positioning,” and sees it as opportunistic and continues to view EURUSD and AUDUSD as the vehicles of choice, preferring to fade intermittent dollar strength (it was looking to add longs at 1.1340 &amp; 0.6950 today), and notes that the DXY is still a long way from the re-test of the 96.65 200dma, which would invalidate its view on the EUR and AUD.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> USDJPY gains were capped overnight around 107.50, with the Nikkei 225 unable to rally following hawkish (read: ‘less dovish’) Fed commentary, while trade factors were also weighing. But in European/US trade, managed to see break above the level, though finds the air around 108.00 thin.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Technicians note the AUD has posted seven days of higher highs, though desks caution ahead of a G20, where disappointment on the US/China front could spill over to the AUD.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> USD strength is weighing on the GBP too, but remarks made by Boris Johnson (who suggested that he could achieve a Parliamentary majority for a hard-Brexit) reminds us about the downside risks faced by the prospect of a no deal Brexit (a threat which still exists, although UK news flow has abated in recent weeks).</p><p><strong>* CNH, CNY:</strong> Ahead of the G20, SocGen highlights that the spread between the onshore and offshore yuans is around zero, signalling a message of cautious optimism amid ample liquidity, the bank says. “The much talked about policy easing by the PBOC following the dovish shift by the Fed still has to crystallise but there no point in the central bank dispending with ammunition before the G20,” SocGen writes, “this means that a decision is likely to come as early as next week.” It also notes that domestic liquidity conditions for Chinese lenders and non-banking financial institutions are poles apart following the seizure of Baoshang Bank on fears of contagion. “The PBOC has returned to the practice of injecting large swathes of liquidity and this has squeezed the overnight repo rate for large banks to below 1.0%, a level last seen in 2009, and this is contrast to the overnight rate of 8% for the overall market.”</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* USD:</strong> Buck higher for a second day, as the market digests the less dovish than expected Fedspeak on Tuesday, after Fed officials on Tuesday leaned-back on the notion of an aggressive 50bps rate cut at the July meeting. Commerzbank suggests that in the medium-term, the size of the rate cut is not as important for the buck. “If for example the Fed were to cut its key rate by 25bps on 31st July but announce in no uncertain terms that a further step was to follow at the 18th September meeting, the effect would be similar to an immediate 50bps step,” Commerz argues, “but of course both alternatives would constitute a stronger signal than a ‘small’ step, not because 0.25 ppts more carry/less carry will make a big difference, but because a large step would illustrate that the Fed is in a hurry, thus increasing the likelihood that there is more to come than the market is expecting at present.” Commerzbank says the more important consideration is why the FOMC is cutting, which says more about how much more there is yet to come.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The EUR short-squeeze has abated, helped by less-dovish-than-expected Fedspeak (per Powell and Bullard on Tuesday), some technicians thinks the 1.14 level may prove to be a short-term top ahead of the G20; the next move will likely be catalysed by the outcome of Trump/Xi talks over the weekend. EUR has today remained sub the figure. However, Credit Suisse says that after the buck strength on Tuesday, it sees FX moves as “expectations management/cleanse of short-term positioning,” and sees it as opportunistic and continues to view EURUSD and AUDUSD as the vehicles of choice, preferring to fade intermittent dollar strength (it was looking to add longs at 1.1340 &amp; 0.6950 today), and notes that the DXY is still a long way from the re-test of the 96.65 200dma, which would invalidate its view on the EUR and AUD.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> USDJPY gains were capped overnight around 107.50, with the Nikkei 225 unable to rally following hawkish (read: ‘less dovish’) Fed commentary, while trade factors were also weighing. But in European/US trade, managed to see break above the level, though finds the air around 108.00 thin.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Technicians note the AUD has posted seven days of higher highs, though desks caution ahead of a G20, where disappointment on the US/China front could spill over to the AUD.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> USD strength is weighing on the GBP too, but remarks made by Boris Johnson (who suggested that he could achieve a Parliamentary majority for a hard-Brexit) reminds us about the downside risks faced by the prospect of a no deal Brexit (a threat which still exists, although UK news flow has abated in recent weeks).</p><p><strong>* CNH, CNY:</strong> Ahead of the G20, SocGen highlights that the spread between the onshore and offshore yuans is around zero, signalling a message of cautious optimism amid ample liquidity, the bank says. “The much talked about policy easing by the PBOC following the dovish shift by the Fed still has to crystallise but there no point in the central bank dispending with ammunition before the G20,” SocGen writes, “this means that a decision is likely to come as early as next week.” It also notes that domestic liquidity conditions for Chinese lenders and non-banking financial institutions are poles apart following the seizure of Baoshang Bank on fears of contagion. “The PBOC has returned to the practice of injecting large swathes of liquidity and this has squeezed the overnight repo rate for large banks to below 1.0%, a level last seen in 2009, and this is contrast to the overnight rate of 8% for the overall market.”</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The TPLEX was on the backfoot as the market digested comments made by FOMC participants on Tuesday, where there seemed to be no urgency to cut rates by a 50bps magnitude, and officials preferring to evaluate multiple factors before settling on a rate cut. There was some downside in premarket trade, with a news organisation mis-quoting US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin (the headline suggested a trade deal with China was 90% done, although Mnuchin was referring to the agreement being 90% complete before talks between US/China broke off); there was buying action that followed from players who had identified the misquote. Analysts also attributed the miss in the durable goods data to some selling, too. US President Trump’s wide-ranging interview reiterated familiar themes (and risks) and led to a few positive ticks in the TPLEX. A mediocre 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps; direct bidders took the most since February, leaving dealers with the smallest share since February as well, the yield was the lowest at a 5s auction since August 2017. The US concludes the week’s supply with an auction of 7s on Thursday. The last two 7-year note auctions have tailed, the last by a chunky 1.9bps on soft cover. The latest positioning data indicates dealers were long in the 6-7 year sector to the tune of around USD 22.6bln, a higher amount than the previous auction cycle, which could be a negative for the auction. SocGen’s analysts hold a slight negative going into the auction; the bank argued that the 7-year sector was trading rich vs 5s and 10s, and is trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The WI yield is also trading beneath all other stop out rates since October 2016, and SocGen says concession will therefore be needed heading into the auction.</p>",

The EIA also reported crude exports reaching a record high of 3.8mln BPD, with imports falling by 1.2mln BPD, this echoes the narrative of US energy independence as well as a pick up in US crude demand due to the geopolitical risks associated with supply out of the Persian Gulf. Separately, the announcement that the Philadelphia gasoline refinery (which oversees a large amount of gasoline supply to the US east coast) that exploded last week is expected to close permanently has been supportive of RBOB gasoline futures, which has likely been providing support to the wider energy sector.</p>",

USD 72bln matures at the month-end settlement, implying USD 59bln of net cash will be raised, TD Securities says.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen’s analysts say some concession will be needed ahead of the auction on an outright basis, since current 5-year WI yields are trading below all stop-out rates since September 2017. The banks says that from a relative value perspective, 5s have not got clear set-up ahead of the auction, and current 5s trade rich vs off the runs in asset swap, though it is slightly cheap on the curve vs 2s and 10s. SocGen says it is neutral on the auction.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/57fa160a-5f97-4c05-853a-50c026335a12.jpg\"><figcaption><i><strong>Source: TD Securities, Societe Generale, US Treasury</strong></i></figcaption></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and broad Dollar rebounded a bit further from post-FOMC lows as US President Trump intimated that it is conceivable to reach a trade deal when he meets China’s Xi at the G20 on Saturday. However, the catalyst for the Greenback’s recovery came well before his interjections that included another broadside against Fed chair Powell that might well have been prompted by the latter tempering rate cut expectations and underlining a contingent approach in terms of providing more accommodation rather than overreacting to a sole (bad) economic indicator. In similar vein even 25 bp rate cut dissenter Bullard expressed opposition to a ½ pt reduction at the next policy meeting at the end of July as this would be too aggressive, but he does envisage 2 moves totalling 50bp by the end of 2019 for a soft landing. The DXY is hovering just below the top of a 96.344-156 band, with sub-forecast headline durable goods and a wider than expected trade gap perhaps capping the upside.</p><p><strong>NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi continues to outstrip all major counterparts, with Nzd/Usd edging closer to 0.6700 again and Aud/Nzd probing under 1.0450 on arguably less dovish RBNZ nuances following a widely anticipated unchanged rate verdict overnight. To recap, an easing bias was maintained but 2 contradictory factors were highlighted alongside subdued domestic growth and downside risks to inflation and employment targets relative to the previous meeting in May.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs their US peer as the Aussie consolidates gains above a confluence of key chart levels around 0.6950 and the Loonie gets an extra boost from the more pronounced recovery in crude as EIA exceeded already lofty API leads. Aud/Usd has been only single digit pips away from 0.7000 and never really in danger of being drawn to decent option expiries layered from 0.6950-40 (1.25 bn) through 0.6930-25 (1 bn) down to 0.6910 (1.1 bn). Meanwhile, Usd/Cad has pulled further away from recent 1.3200+ peaks towards 1.3125 at one stage and the <strong>NOK </strong>extended post-strong Norwegian labour report gains with the aid of oil as well, with Eur/Nok probing under 9.6550 vs a more stable Eur/<strong>SEK</strong> cross on the 10.5300 handle.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Laggards all day on a back-up and re-steepening along the US Treasury yield curve, the Yen slipped to 107.75 at worst and Franc fell to 0.9785 before both pared some losses and Usd/Jpy perhaps stalled amidst 3.4 bn expiries stretching from 107.70 to 108.10. Meanwhile, <strong>EUR</strong>/Chf was more contained around 1.1100 within a wider 1.1115-1.1075 range as the single currency meandered between 1.1382-49 against the Buck and largely inside major chart supports and mega option interest on the topside. Similarly, the Pound held comparatively tight lines as Cable found underlying buyers near wtd lows vs resistance not far above 1.2700 and Eur/Gbp straddled 0.8950, albeit with a firmer bias on no deal Brexit jitters and with little independent direction from the delayed BoE appearance at the TSC to present’s May’s QIR.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lots of noise and breaking headlines, but little net reaction or adverse moves across the region as the Usd failed to maintain its recovery momentum as noted above. However, the Peso is now eyeing the Banxico for more direction with Usd/Mxn below 19.1350 in wake of positive comments from US President Trump on Mexico’s border control efforts.</p>",

This was after Fed Chair Powell said many on the Fed see a case for more accommodation but also stressed the importance of not overreacting, and Fed’s Bullard who was the lone dovish dissenter at the last meeting, stated that he does not prefer a 50bps rate cut in July. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.3%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.5%)</strong> weakened with Australia led lower by gold miners after a pullback in the precious metal although resilience in healthcare, materials and industrials limited the downside, while sentiment in Tokyo was also downbeat with Japan Display among the laggards in the spotlight after several other groups withdrew from the Co. bailout. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%)</strong> were indecisive amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and ongoing uncertainty heading into the Trump-Xi meeting at this week’s G20, with the US said to be unwilling to give concessions on trade at the meeting and that no broad deal is expected, although it was also reported that the US is considering suspending the next round of tariffs on an additional USD 300bln of Chinese imports as the sides prepare to resume trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the late losses seen in T-notes as market pricing of a 50bps Fed cut in July declined to 25% from around 43% the prior day, although the downside for Japanese bonds was cushioned by the negative risk tone and BoJ Rinban operation for JPY 775bln of JGBs concentrated in 1yr-5yr maturities.</p><p><strong>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Although some suggested that Mnuchin was speaking in the past tense. Nonetheless, this boosted bourses out of the neutral/flat territory they had been in. Sectors are mixed, with energy and material names supported by price action in oil and base metals respectively, while financials outperform as yields nursed some recent losses post-Bullard and Powell, meanwhile the latest bout of Mnuchin-sparked “risk on” also weighed on bonds. Furthermore, chip names are supported amid optimistic earnings from Micron after-market yesterday (STMicroelectronics +2.5%, AMS +4.1%, Infineon +1.2%). In terms of other individual movers, Thyssenkrupp (+7.0%) shares spiked higher at the open amid speculation that Kone (-0.1%) is readying a bid for the Co’s elevator unit. Meanwhile, Brenntag (-4.1%) rest at the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid reports that the Co. sold dual-use chemicals to Syria.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The DXY has forged a firmer base above 96.000, and thanks in large part to a recalibration of July FOMC easing prospects prompted by Powell and Bullard that have both cautioned against reacting too aggressively to downside growth and inflation risks. Hence, market pricing has shifted further towards 25 bp from 50 bp and the Greenback is clawing back some losses, especially against safer-havens amidst pre-G20 comments from US Treasury Security Mnuchin reiterating that 90% of the trade accord with China has been completed. The index is holding within 96.145-322 parameters, and for now at least not succumbing to bearish spot month end rebalancing requirements according to 3 if not more bank models.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD - </strong>The Kiwi is extending its winning run in wake of the RBNZ’s latest policy meeting and accompanying statement that reinforced guidance for lower rates, but was tempered somewhat by a balanced assessment of the economic outlook due to softer property prices vs more expansive fiscal policy. Moreover, the aforementioned latest US-China reports have sparked a broad rise in risk appetite with Nzd/Usd just topping out around 0.6680 and Aud/Usd retesting offers/resistance ahead of 0.7000. Meanwhile, the Loonie is consolidating gains made on the back of yesterday’s upbeat Canadian wholesale trade data with the aid of rebounding oil prices, with Usd/Cad hovering close to the bottom of a 1.3193-42 range and not visibly reacting to China extending its import ban to include all meat from Canada.</p><p><strong>NOK - </strong>Another marked G10 outperformer and also fuelled by the post-API crude comeback, but deriving additional momentum from much better than forecast Norwegian jobs data, as Eur/Nok nestles around 9.6600 vs 9.7125 at one stage.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF - </strong>As noted above, the Yen and Franc have been undermined by less dovish Fed perceptions and revived US-China trade aspirations even though the Mnuchin ‘revelation’ is likely a statement about how things stood before talks ended in accusations of blame for reneging on pledges by both sides. Nevertheless, Usd/Jpy has nudged up over 107.50 from sub-107.00 on Tuesday and into the upper echelons of option expiries extending to 108.00-10 in decent size – see our 7.11BST post on the headline feed for full details. Similarly, Usd/Chf has rebounded to 0.9780 or thereabouts and Eur/Chf is back above 1.1100.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR - </strong>Sterling and the single currency are both relatively rangebound as Cable flits between 1.2705-2664 amidst BoE testimony to the TSC ostensibly on the now dated May QIR that merely underlined ongoing Brexit dependent policy guidance and Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8950. Eur/Usd has pulled back further from its modest 1.1400+ advance, but finding support ahead of 1.1350 and decent technical levels a fraction below, such as the 200 DMA and WMA. Note also, large expiry interest from 1.1370-80 (3.2 bn) and 1.1385-90 (1.8 bn) are likely to cap the headline pair.</p><p><strong>RBNZ kept the OCR unchanged as expected</strong> and stated that a <strong>lower OCR may be needed over time, while it noted downside risks to employment as well as inflation</strong> but also sees inflation rising to 2%. RBNZ stated that the committee discussed the merits of lowering OCR at this meeting and noted risk of ongoing subdued domestic growth, while it added that risks to achieving CPI and sustainable employment objectives are tilted to the downside relative to the May statement. However, the members also noted 2 largely offsetting developments affecting the outlook for domestic growth which were softer house price inflation and additional fiscal stimulus. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core bonds have succumbed to another bout of selling, with the latest downside pressure coming after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reiterated that the US-China deal is 90% complete. Even though the comment did not contain any fresh news or developments, and the remaining 10% is the crux of the recent breakdown in communications, his remark has lifted hopes for the Trump-Xi G20 meet. Hence, Bunds hit fresh session lows of 172.38 (-42 ticks from highs) and USTs to 127-24 vs 128-06 at best and 128-08+ at one stage yesterday. On the periphery, and largely unresponsive to the US-China comments, BTPs dropped below the 133.0 figure on ISTAT’s Q1 deficit/GDP measure coming in at 4.1% vs. Prev. 2.0%; printing a session low of 132.97, albeit briefly as the excess was qualified by seasonal factors. Elsewhere, the delayed BoE QIR testimony has not revealed anything too fresh in terms of policy, though this isn’t unexpected given June's MPC gathering occurring last week. Looking ahead, and of note for US Treasuries comments from Fed Non-Voter Daly alongside Durables data and the second of this week’s short end supply in the form of a 41bln 5yr sale.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>futures have held onto most of their API-inspired gains (crude stocks -7.7mln vs. Exp. -2.5mln) with the former hovering close to the USD 59/bbl mark (having briefly breached the level to the upside) whilst the latter eyes USD 66/bbl. News-flow for the complex has been light thus far, albeit prices are also underpinned by supply-side disruptions after Exxon’s Beaumont Texas refinery (366K bpd) suffered multiple upsets due to a power loss, while Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the largest refinery in the US East coast (335K BPD), is expected to be closed down after a recent fire. Elsewhere<strong>, gold</strong> remains just above the USD 1400/oz after retreating form 6yr highs as the USD recoiled after Fed’s Bullard and Powell tempered expectations of a 50bps cut. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices extend gains above USD 2.7/lb, now eyeing 2.75/lb as strikes in the world’s largest open-pit mine (Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine) continue, with the workers reportedly blocking roads leading to other mines.&nbsp;</p><p>In other news, Philadelphia Energy Solutions is expected to close its oil refinery following the recent fire, while the refinery is the largest in the east coast of the US with a capacity of 335k bpd. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Barclays </strong>expects oil prices at USD 73/bbl in H2 2019, expects OPEC+ to roll over current deal and sees main oil producers maintaining close to 100% compliance in H2 2019, unless Iranian and Venezuelan situation deteriorates further.

News-flow for the complex has been light thus far, albeit prices are also underpinned by supply-side disruptions after Exxon’s Beaumont Texas refinery (366K bpd) suffered multiple upsets due to a power loss, while Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the largest refinery in the US East coast (335K BPD), is expected to be closed down after a recent fire. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> remains just above the USD 1400/oz after retreating form 6yr highs as the USD recoiled after Fed’s Bullard and Powell tempered expectations of a 50bps cut. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices extend gains above USD 2.7/lb, now eyeing 2.75/lb as strikes in the world’s largest open-pit mine (Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine) continue, with the workers reportedly blocking roads leading to other mines.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>has forged a firmer base above 96.000, and thanks in large part to a recalibration of July FOMC easing prospects prompted by Powell and Bullard that have both cautioned against reacting too aggressively to downside growth and inflation risks. Hence, market pricing has shifted further towards 25 bp from 50 bp and the Greenback is clawing back some losses, especially against safer-havens amidst pre-G20 comments from US Treasury Security Mnuchin reiterating that 90% of the trade accord with China has been completed. The index is holding within 96.145-322 parameters, and for now at least not succumbing to bearish spot month end rebalancing requirements according to 3 if not more bank models.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is extending its winning run in wake of the RBNZ’s latest policy meeting and accompanying statement that reinforced guidance for lower rates, but was tempered somewhat by a balanced assessment of the economic outlook due to softer property prices vs more expansive fiscal policy. Moreover, the aforementioned latest US-China reports have sparked a broad rise in risk appetite with Nzd/Usd just topping out around 0.6680 and Aud/Usd retesting offers/resistance ahead of 0.7000. Meanwhile, the Loonie is consolidating gains made on the back of yesterday’s upbeat Canadian wholesale trade data with the aid of rebounding oil prices, with Usd/Cad hovering close to the bottom of a 1.3193-42 range and not visibly reacting to China extending its import ban to include all meat from Canada.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>Another marked G10 outperformer and also fuelled by the post-API crude comeback, but deriving additional momentum from much better than forecast Norwegian jobs data, as Eur/Nok nestles around 9.6600 vs 9.7125 at one stage.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Yen and Franc have been undermined by less dovish Fed perceptions and revived US-China trade aspirations even though the Mnuchin ‘revelation’ is likely a statement about how things stood before talks ended in accusations of blame for reneging on pledges by both sides. Nevertheless, Usd/Jpy has nudged up over 107.50 from sub-107.00 on Tuesday and into the upper echelons of option expiries extending to 108.00-10 in decent size – see our 7.11BST post on the headline feed for full details. Similarly, Usd/Chf has rebounded to 0.9780 or thereabouts and Eur/Chf is back above 1.1100.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling and the single currency are both relatively rangebound as Cable flits between 1.2705-2664 amidst BoE testimony to the TSC ostensibly on the now dated May QIR that merely underlined ongoing Brexit dependent policy guidance and Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8950. Eur/Usd has pulled back further from its modest 1.1400+ advance, but finding support ahead of 1.1350 and decent technical levels a fraction below, such as the 200 DMA and WMA. Note also, large expiry interest from 1.1370-80 (3.2 bn) and 1.1385-90 (1.8 bn) are likely to cap the headline pair.</p>",

Similarly, the STIR strip has pared some of its mainly Fed-induced dovish momentum and the curve is re-steepening with 3 month contracts ranging between +0.5 to -2 ticks. In terms of Wednesday’s domestic agenda, BBA mortgage approvals are due, but highly likely to be overshadowed by the BoE’s QIR grilling from 10.15BST. Note, the TSC event was delayed and has now been superseded by last week’s June MPC meeting, but may still warrant attention for any tweaks to guidance and more on Brexit assessments.</p>",

However, the pull-back in core debt has been relatively measured and limited again as the 10 year German benchmark rebounds from a 172.60 low to 172.82 at best vs an opening print of 172.76 and Tuesday’s 172.88 close, which was just 4 ticks shy of the new contract high.

Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the late losses seen in T-notes as market pricing of a 50bps Fed cut in July declined to 25% from around 43% the prior day, although the downside for Japanese bonds was cushioned by the negative risk tone and BoJ Rinban operation for JPY 775bln of JGBs concentrated in 1yr-5yr maturities.</p><p><strong>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>greenback</strong> was firmer as it sustained the Fed-induced gains, in particular from comments made by dovish dissenter Bullard who distanced himself from the notion of a 50bps cut in July which he suggested would be ‘overdone’. This helped the <strong>DXY</strong> snap a 4-day losing streak and pressured its major counterparts across the pond with <strong>EUR/USD</strong> subdued near 1.1350 and which saw <strong>GBP/USD</strong> give up the 1.2700 handle. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> was spurred by the strength of the greenback and approached the 107.50 level where there are a cluster of nearby large option expiries for today’s New York cut, and antipodeans were resilient overnight with <strong>AUD/USD</strong> kept afloat by multiple DMA levels near 0.6950. <strong>NZD/USD</strong> was initially pressured in a knee-jerk reaction to the RBNZ rate decision where the OCR was maintained at 1.50% as expected and the central bank stated that lower rates may be needed over time. However, <strong>NZD/USD</strong> then recouped the losses after the dust settled as members also noted 2 largely offsetting developments affecting the domestic growth outlook which were softer house price inflation and additional fiscal stimulus.</p><p><strong>RBNZ kept the OCR unchanged as expected</strong> and stated that a <strong>lower OCR may be needed over time, while it noted downside risks to employment as well as inflation</strong> but also sees inflation rising to 2%. RBNZ stated that the committee discussed the merits of lowering OCR at this meeting and noted risk of ongoing subdued domestic growth, while it added that risks to achieving CPI and sustainable employment objectives are tilted to the downside relative to the May statement. However, the members also noted 2 largely offsetting developments affecting the outlook for domestic growth which were softer house price inflation and additional fiscal stimulus.

Attention in early trade was on the 10-year yield, which once again breached 2% to the downside around the cash equity open, as well as the negative US 2-year swap spread, which saw a negative reaction in stocks too; the data slate helped support the complex. Later in the session, Fed’s Bullard leaned back in the notion of a 50bps rate cut in July. Powell’s comments were balanced, but the Fed Chair offered little to suggest a 50bps rate cut was coming, instead Powell choosing to adopt a more circumspect approach. The US 2-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens, while cover was above recent averages. There was little of note in the bidder breakdown. US T-note futures (U9) settled 6 ticks higher at 128-04.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell (Neutral)</strong> <strong>said many on the Fed see a case for more accommodation but don't want to overreact to single data points</strong>, while he noted that rates are low and are likely to remain so. Powell also suggested that in a general matter, it is better to act pre-emptively and not let any economic downturns gain steam, while he sees the market’s tepid inflation expectations as a reason for lowering rates but also <strong>repeated it is important for the FOMC not to overreact</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Bullard (Voter, Dove)</strong> said <strong>he does not prefer a 50bps rate cut in July and stated that he voted for a rate cut at the last meeting since inflation is running below target and inflation expectations are deteriorating</strong>. Bullard added that by not cutting, the Fed has put higher probability on the July meeting and that he does not like that tactic as he suggested that if the conditions are right today, you should move today. Furthermore, Bullard said that a 50bps cut would be ‘overdone’ but doesn’t want to prejudge the meeting and that he thinks 2 rate cuts by end of the year would ensure a soft landing and shift policy from slightly restrictive to slightly accommodative, while he also stated that he was approached by the Trump administration in recent months about a seat on Fed board, but said he was happy in his current job. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawk)</strong> said there are risks the US could talk itself into a recession although he doesn’t see any signs this is happening yet and commented that inflation expectations are very anchored, while Barkin added that he doesn't know if a rate cut or cuts are needed this year and that Fed policy is still modestly accommodative. (Newswires)</p><p>US administration official said USD would be less strong and the EUR would be less weak if the Fed took back rate hike from last fall, while the official added that there are many opinions in the White House about the President's authority to demote Powell but also stated that the White House has no plans to demote Fed Chair Powell.

This was after Fed Chair Powell said many on the Fed see a case for more accommodation but also stressed the importance of not overreacting, and Fed’s Bullard who was the lone dovish dissenter at the last meeting, stated that he does not prefer a 50bps rate cut in July. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) weakened with Australia led lower by gold miners after a pullback in the precious metal although resilience in healthcare, materials and industrials limited the downside, while sentiment in Tokyo was also downbeat with Japan Display among the laggards in the spotlight after several other groups withdrew from the Co. bailout. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were indecisive amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and ongoing uncertainty heading into the Trump-Xi meeting at this week’s G20, with the US said to be unwilling to give concessions on trade at the meeting and that no broad deal is expected, although it was also reported that the US is considering suspending the next round of tariffs on an additional USD 300bln of Chinese imports as the sides prepare to resume trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the late losses seen in T-notes as market pricing of a 50bps Fed cut in July declined to 25% from around 43% the prior day, although the downside for Japanese bonds was cushioned by the negative risk tone and BoJ Rinban operation for JPY 775bln of JGBs concentrated in 1yr-5yr maturities.</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia trades mostly subdued after Fed speakers temper rate cut bets",
        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly subdued following the headwinds from Wall St where stocks posted their worst performance in nearly a month as Fed speakers tempered rate cut bets. This was after Fed Chair Powell said many on the Fed see a case for more accommodation but also stressed the importance of not overreacting, and Fed’s Bullard who was the lone dovish dissenter at the last meeting, stated that he does not prefer a 50bps rate cut in July. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are weaker with Australia led lower by gold miners after a pullback in the precious metal although resilience in healthcare, materials and industrials has limited the downside, while sentiment in Tokyo is also downbeat with Japan Display among the laggards in the spotlight after several other groups withdrew from the Co. bailout. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are choppy amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and ongoing uncertainty heading into the Trump-Xi meeting at this week’s G20, with the US said to be unwilling to give concessions on trade at the meeting and that no broad deal is expected, although it was also reported that the US is considering suspending the next round of tariffs on an additional USD 300bln of Chinese imports as the sides prepare to resume trade discussions.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is firmer as it sustains the Fed-induced gains, in particular from comments made by dovish dissenter Bullard who distanced himself from the notion of a 50bps cut in July which he suggested would be ‘overdone’. This helped the DXY snap a 4-day losing streak and pressured its major counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD subdued near 1.1350 and which saw GBP/USD give up the 1.2700 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was spurred by the strength of the greenback and approaches the 107.50 level where there are a cluster of nearby large option expiries for today’s New York cut, and antipodeans are resilient overnight with AUD/USD kept afloat by multiple DMA levels near 0.6950. NZD/USD was initially pressured in a knee-jerk reaction to the RBNZ rate decision where the OCR was maintained at 1.50% as expected and the central bank stated that lower rates may be needed over time. However, NZD/USD then recouped the losses after the dust settled as members also noted 2 largely offsetting developments affecting the domestic growth outlook which were softer house price inflation and additional fiscal stimulus.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the losses seen in T-notes as market pricing of a 50bps Fed cut in July declined to 25% from around 43% the prior day, although the downside for Japanese bonds was cushioned amid the negative risk tone in Japan and BoJ presence for JPY 775bln of JGBs concentrated in 1yr-5yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The RBNZ is expected to keep the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 1.50% when it announces its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday with markets pricing in over 72% probability for the OCR to be maintained and less than a 28% chance for a 25bps cut. In addition, one major newswire survey showed all economists surveyed were in complete accord regarding forecasts for no change in rates.</p><p>Expectations for a hold follows the unanimous decision to cut rates by 25bps at the last meeting which was the first to be determined under the 7-member Monetary Policy Committee. Therefore, given the proximity of the cut, it is more likely that the central bank will prefer a wait and see approach till the full impact of its prior action is known. More importantly, RBNZ Governor Orr explicitly stated at the MPS press conference that he thinks the RBNZ are in a good position to observe data and the outlook seems more balanced looking ahead than before the cut.</p><p>Other central bank officials have also dampened prospects of a back-to-back cut as RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand recently stated they are observing data and the budget to assess if a 2nd rate cut is required, while Assistant Governor Hawkesby noted that the RBNZ's central view is for interest rates to remain broadly around current levels for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The recent data also suggests a lack of urgency for further policy loosening as Q1 GDP Y/Y topped estimates at 2.5% vs. Exp. 2.4% (Prev. 2.3%, Rev. 2.5%) and although the Q/Q reading was just inline at 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%), the other components of the GDP release such as Annual Average and Expenditure were better than expected. The latest trade figures were also encouraging as Trade Balance, Export and Imports for May all surpassed forecasts.</p><p>The announcement is due at 0300BST/2100CDT/1000HKT and aside from the actual rate decision, focus will quickly turn to the Monetary Policy Statement for clues on the future path of rates and if the central bank reaffirms or deviates from the view regarding a more balanced outlook. Furthermore, any comments that support the current pricing in of a cut in August are likely to weigh on NZD, while a lack thereof could trigger a paring of dovish bets and boost the currency.</p><p>Recent calls&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Bank of New Zealand expects RBNZ to cut rates at the August meeting.</li><li>Westpac also forecasts RBNZ to cut rates in August.</li><li>JPMorgan sees RBNZ lowering rates to as low as 1.00% this year.</li></ul>",
