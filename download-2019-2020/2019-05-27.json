Trump also threatened that tariffs on Chinese goods could go up \"very easily.\" The comments were made on his State Visit to Japan. However, the President suggested that he believes that a trade deal could be reached sometime in the future, and that China and the US will absolutely have a great trade deal.</p><p><strong>* ITALY</strong>: EU commission is considering opening the disciplinary process on Italy, perhaps as soon as 5 June, over 2018 debt levels, and Italy risks up to EUR 4bln EU fine. The News added to the Bund/BTP widening seen on Monday.</p><p><strong>* AUSTRIA:</strong> Chancellor Kurz has been ousted after losing a confidence following the “Ibiza affair” scandal that split his coalition apart. President Van Der Bellen is now expected to place a technocratic government in charge until elections in Q3.</p><p><strong>* EU ELECTIONS</strong>: There wasn’t anything to scare the markets in the outcome of the European Elections. Turnout across the bloc was decent, and greens, nationalists and liberals performed well.; the right wing anti-EU parties extended their share of the vote to 23% (vs. 20% in 2014), and meanwhile, the four largest pro-European parties saw their combined share of the vote fall to 67% from 70%, still leaving a majority of pro-Europeans in the Parliament. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-eu-parliamentary-elections-27-05-2019\">Click here for the full RANsquawk analysis of the EU Elections.</a></p><p><strong>* ECB</strong>: ECB’s Hansson said that any new TLTRO facility should be priced with less-generous terms, signalling that the central bank is on track for normalisation, adding that tiering ECB rates would risk overcomplicating policy, and may unfairly help the banking sector more than others.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS</strong>: The North Koreans said US National Security advisor Bolton was incorrect in concluding that recent missile tests were a violation of UN resolutions. US President Trump is expecting “good things” on North Korea, noting that there had not been any nuclear testing. Trump said he was in no rush with North Korea, and that he was not bothered by the recent launch of short-range missiles. On Iran, Trump again stated that he was not seeking regime change; the Iranians later said US sanctions policy has threatened stability in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S TREASURY SUPPLY</strong>: The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 131bln in new 2-year (USD 40bln, Tue), new 5-year (USD 41bln, also on Tue), and new 7-year (USD 32bln, Wed), as well as a 2-year FRN re-opening (USD 18bln, Wed). UBS notes that there are USD 81bln of cash flows this week (including USD 73bln of redemptions + USD 8bln of coupons) falling due, implying net supply at around USD 50bln. Recent Auctions have generally been received well, TD Securities notes, even though recent 10-year sale was soft. TD notes that takedown statistics show investment funds continuing to take increasing allotments in recent months (54% of April supply). \"Despite Treasury's decision not to cut coupon auction sizes later this year, we believe the Fed's open market purchases of Treasuries to replace MBS runoff later this year will help buoy the market,\" TD says. Recent auctions suggests the 2-year auction could stop on the screws with a 64% buy-side takedown (48% indirect, 16% direct); after last month's solid demand at the 5-year auction, recent averages point to a small tail (0.2bps), with 74% buy-side takedown).</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>The crude complex reopened Sunday evening on the back foot, trading choppy through the European session amid light trade and narrow ranges, with the US and UK players away due to market holidays. The complex caught a bid in afternoon trade, but Action seems capped at USD 70 for Brent and USD 59 for WTI. In terms of a narrative, there has been little updates on energy markets with newswires highlighting the over-arching themes currently in energy markets. Analysts note that limiting gains on the upside is the pessimistic global demand outlook, with a lack of resolution on the US-China trade front feeding into that. To take the side of the bulls, the geopolitical risk premium associated with an increasing US presence in the Persian Gulf will be providing some tail winds; separately supporting prices, OPEC+ production cuts are not likely to abruptly end anytime too soon where, excluding Russia, OPEC+ members last weekend expressed support for sustained cuts.</p><p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> has not seen any of the choppiness that we have come to expect (consolidating around 97.75), after Trump said US is not ready to make a trade deal with China, although US participants are away for Memorial Day. Havens <strong>JPY, CHF</strong> were slightly lower (JPY back to 109.50, CHF above parity). <strong>EUR</strong> saw some downside in the European day (slightly sub-1.12), pressured by widening Bund/BTP yield differentials, after reports the EC might open up proceedings on Italy over high debt; the European Elections had only a modest impact on financial markets. <strong>GBP</strong> is softer (sub 1.27) as Brexit Party took the largest share at the European Elections in the UK, reinforcing the impression that the Tories will need to come out strongly in favour of Brexit if they are to avoid losing further vote share. <strong>CAD</strong> trades neutral (c. 1.3440) ahead of Wednesday’s BOC, where the bank is likely to reiterate the need for accommodation despite improving domestic fundamentals. <strong>AUD</strong> (thin range above 0.69) and <strong>NZD</strong> (thin range around 0.6950) flat/slightly lower. <strong>CNH</strong> slightly stronger vs USD after CBIRC on the weekend said it did not expect a persistent decline in Yuan, and warned speculative shorts they would suffer \"heavy losses\" if they bet against the yuan. Other EMFX is mixed.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck has gained traction in recent trade amid thin liquidity and a lack of catalysts due to UK and US traders enjoying a long weekend. The Greenback was little fazed by comments from US President Trump at the US-Japan presser in which he noted that the US is not ready for a trade deal with China yet. The Dollar index has picked up some steam recently, albeit remaining within a 97.55-85.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Throughout the morning, the single currency ranged just beneath 1.1200 (vs USD) in the aftermath of uneventful European Parliamentary elections. In afternoon trade, EURUSD saw a small pop lower to 1.1190 on news that the European Commission was mulling disciplinary action against Italy over its growing debt levels, with the potential fine being up to EUR 4bln. Bund-BTP spreads widened on the news. Returning to issue of Parliamentary Elections; focus will now be set on a coalition building process and the follow-through from the nomination of a European Commission President (following Juncker’s departure on October 31st) to the ECB President (EC and ECB Presidents are unlikely be from the same country). In terms of potential coalitions, the main scenarios are touted, with 376 seats needed for majority: 1) EPP, Socialists, Liberals, Greens (506 seats), 2) EPP, Socialists, Liberals (436 seats), 3) EPP, Socialists, Green (399 seats). Nonetheless, EUR/USD fluctuates on either side of 1.1200 and within a relatively narrow 1.1190-1215 band with just over 600mln in option expiries scattered between strike 1.1175-1200.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>On the other side of channel, the Pound drifted lower, with some traders attributing downside in Cable to a slight pickup in the Dollar. However, an uncertain political backdrop regarding Brexit remains; in which some are suggesting the Brexit party’s recent advances in the European elections may spur potential successors to UK PM May to take a harder line on Europe.</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong></p><p>The “risk-on” mood coupled with the thin liquidity has sparked an unwind in risk premium with both currencies underperforming in the G10 space and losing vs the USD and EUR. EUR/CHF did see some downside on news that the European Commission may discipline Italy, but remains in the middle of its intraday range of 1.1220-63 whilst USD/JPY tests resistance at the 109.50 level.</p><p><strong>AUD, CAD, NZD</strong></p><p>Again, little movement in the currencies due to a lack of catalysts and Europe’s largest FX trading hub away on Bank Holiday. The risk currencies seem to take the cue from the Dollar for now with all three pairs vs. Buck trading within a 20 pip intraday range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira remains in the spotlight amid the CBRT’s continuing attempts to stem its depreciation. Latest efforts involve hiking the RRR for FX deposits by 200bps to withdraw liquidity USD 4.2bln in liquidity from the market. The move seeped some strength into the TRY with USD/TRY now around 6.0500 having fluctuated within a 6.0350-1000 range thus far.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>SUMMARY:&nbsp;</strong>European elections failed to deliver any drastic upsets; right wing anti-EU parties extended their share of the vote to 23% (vs. 20% in 2014). The Greens &amp; Liberals also put in a strong showing, especially in France, Germany and the UK. In sum, the four largest pro-European parties saw their combined share of the vote fall to 67% from 70%.</p><p><strong>PARLIAMENTARY ARITHMETIC: </strong>The current two largest pro-European and centrist parties, the EPP and S&amp;D are expected to lose their majority, their total seat count falling to 320. The biggest gainers were the liberals/greens and right-wing/nationalist parties. CapEco notes “if the EPP and S&amp;D team up with the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE), which is projected to win just over 100 seats, they will have a clear majority.” For this reason, it expects pro-European policies proposed by the European Council and Commission to continue to receive parliamentary approval and, as such, EU economic policy to continue unaffected, adding “it makes sense that there has been little or no reaction in currency or bond markets so far” (albeit there has been a slight widening of BTP-Bund spreads, and a narrowing of Greek/Germany differentials after the pro-business party performed well and PM Tsipras called elections).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=1cfba2de90&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1634676603922611805&amp;th=16af89b5db72fe5d&amp;view=fimg&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ-LVoQQiV-e4EE836dY8EabY4DqAqV2tP_TmVJ1rk9R-YM3Q2YFdOpMkzEkiDkm9ZkqcxcWNhKgZr-arUmaruDpSFrSOLqqQGDxy35enUXsnEUN45nOCvb-_xo&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=16af839acddc204bfcc1\" alt=\"Beschreibung: Beschreibung: cid:image003.png@01D51465.80FE9CC0\"></figure><p><strong>KEY JOBS - EC PRESIDENT:</strong>&nbsp;EU leaders will now look to determine who gets the top jobs at two summits; the first this Tuesday, the second on 20-21 June.&nbsp;Manfred Weber&nbsp;of the centre right EPP, who remain the largest party in the parliament, is expected to maintain his claim to precede current head of the European Commission Junker. However, SocGen notes a progressive alliance comprising Greens, Socialists and possibly liberals from the ALDE means&nbsp;EC VP Timmermans or Competition&nbsp;Commissioner Vestager&nbsp;could also be in the running.</p><p><strong>KEY JOBS - ECB PRESIDENT:&nbsp;</strong>On a possible successor for Draghi as ECB President, Berenberg suggests that “if Weber still manages to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker at the helm of the European Commission, France would probably nominate&nbsp;Francois Villeroy de Galhau&nbsp;(or [Bank of France deputy] Sylvie Goulard) as the next ECB president” whilst, if Weber’s bid fails, “Germany may claim the ECB for&nbsp;Jens Weidmann, with Finland’s&nbsp;Olli Rehn&nbsp;as a potential compromise candidate acceptable to virtually all euro member governments”. Italy may ask for a consolation prize, Berenberg suggests, which could be a foreign policy chief acceptable to Salvini.</p><p><strong>GERMANY</strong>: German Chancellor Merkel’s coalition suffered their worst ever result in a national election; CDU/CSU and SPD support fell to below 29% and 16% respectively. Support for the Greens grew to 20%, while AfD garnered 11% of the vote. Berenberg notes that the collapse in support for SPD increases risk that left wingers in the party may force a walkout of the party’s current coalition with Merkel’s CDU/CSU, a move which would bring down the current German Chancellor. However, Berenberg considers it more likely they will postpone any decision to after state elections in East Germany and their mid-term review of the coalition with CDU/CSU.</p><p><strong>FRANCE</strong>: French President Macron’s party just lost out to Le Pen’s right-wing party, with 22.3% and 23.4% respectively, however support for the latter fell from 24.9% in 2014. Berenberg notes that with Macron’s solid majority in French parliament, he still has plenty of time for his reforms to work before elections in 2022.</p><p><strong>ITALY</strong>: Salvini’s right wing Lega party garnered the most support with 34.3%, his governing coalition party Five Star Movement got 17%. CapEco suggests that Salvini’s strong showing may encourage him to end the current coalition with Five Star and either call an election or join forces with Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. The consultancy notes “Italian economic policy should not change much: a coalition between the League and Forza Italia would be equally likely to clash with the EU.”</p><p><strong>UK</strong>: As expected, the Brexit party won the highest vote share with 31.6%, a result that Berenberg suggest is likely to encourage the Conservative Party leadership contenders to take a harder line on Europe. However, Berenberg also notes that support for hard-line Brexit parties (Brexit party + UKIP) has only increased 7.5% since 2014, whilst the two major parties shed 26.1% since 2014. In that regard, the major winner is the Liberal Democrats, who gained 20% of the vote (up from 7% in 2014).</p><p><strong>GREECE</strong>: Greek PM Tsipras’s Syriza party (23.7%) were defeated by the centre-right Mitsotakis’s New Democracy party (33.2%), spurring Tspiras to call an early general election, in which the New Democracy party are expected to win. Berenberg comment that “the centre-right would probably safeguard the key achievements of Greece’s harsh adjustment programme and raise trend growth through tax reform and deregulation.”</p>",

Sectors are all higher with industrial names lagging due to dismal Chinese industrial profits data overnight, whilst on the flip side, the consumer discretionary sector is driven forward by the mass gains in auto names sparked by a 50/50 merger agreement between Fiat Chrysler (+10.0%) and Renault (+13.7%). The merged entity will reportedly take over a year to set-up, with sources stating that Renault will delay its merger plans with Nissan if an agreement is struck with Fiat Chrysler. The news, coupled with a seemingly positive meeting between US and Japan underpinned the likes of Daimler (+0.8%), Volkswagen (+0.7%), BMW (+0.5%) in sympathy. However, Peugeot shares (-2.8%) failed to benefit from the FCA/Renault announcement amid competition in the French auto market alongside prior speculation of a potential Fiat-Peugeot tie-up. Furthermore, Exor (+6%) also spiked higher at the open given its 29% ownership in Fiat Chrysler. In terms of other movers, SMI giant Novartis (+1.6%) opened higher after receiving two FDA approvals, with one being for the world’s most expensive drug.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Buck has gained traction in recent trade amid thin liquidity and a lack of catalysts due to UK and US traders enjoying a long weekend. The Buck was little fazed by comments from US President Trump at the US-Japan presser in which he noted that the US is not ready for a trade deal with China yet. The Dollar index has picked up some steam recently, albeit remains within a 97.55-73 range with only potential macro newsflow to eye throughout the day.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong> - The single currency is little changed as the dust settles from the European Parliamentary elections in which prelim results indicated a shrinking in the centrist parties which have fallen short of the majority needed in the 751-strong assembly. Eyes will now be set on a coalition building process and the follow-through from the nomination of a European Commission President (following Juncker’s departure on October 31st) to the ECB President (EC and ECB Presidents are unlikely be from the same country). In terms of potential coalitions, the main scenarios are touted, with 376 seats needed for majority: 1) EPP, Socialists, Liberals, Greens (506 seats), 2) EPP, Socialists, Liberals (436 seats), 3) EPP, Socialists, Green (399 seats). Nonetheless, EUR/USD fluctuates on either side of 1.1200 and within a relatively narrow 1.1190-1215 band with just over 600mln in option expiries scattered between strike 1.1175-1200. Over on the other side of channel, the Pound also trades with flat on the day, albeit off highs and closer to the bottom of a 1.2700-55 range vs. the Greenback with recent downside in Cable attributed to a slight pickup in the Dollar</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong> - The “risk-on” mood coupled with the thin liquidity has sparked an unwind in risk premium with both currencies underperforming in the G10 space and losing vs the USD and EUR. EUR/CHF currently remains near the top of the currency intraday range of 1.1220-63 whilst USD/JPY tests support at the 109.50 level.</p><p><strong>AUD, CAD, NZD</strong> - Again, little movement in the currencies due to a lack of catalysts and Europe’s largest FX trading hub away on Bank Holiday. The risk currencies seem to take the cue from the Dollar for now with all three pairs vs. Buck trading within a 20 pip intraday range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Turkish Lira remains in the spotlight amid the CBRT’s continuing attempts to stem its depreciation. Latest effort involve hiking the RRR for FX deposits by 200bps to withdraw liquidity USD 4.2bln in liquidity from the market. The move seeped some strength into the TRY with USD/TRY now around 6.0500 having fluctuated within a 6.0350-1000 range thus far.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core EU debt trading has largely been driven by the European Parliamentary results, which saw the centre-right lose ground to the effervescent Greens and the growing left and right-wing parties. <strong>10yr</strong> <strong>Bund</strong> futures are outperforming and trade ~17-ticks higher of Friday’s close and sit comfortably at the top of a 20-tick range. The main takeaway from the mainland elections comes from Italy, however, which saw League gain ground and develop a vociferous lead over their coalition partners with this sparking more concerns over the stability of their agreement. <strong>10yr BTP</strong> futures trade with losses of about 10 ticks and remain the loss leader in Europe, as the benchmark hangs below the 131.00 level with the May 17th 130.31 high eyed up next on the downside.</p><p>US debt trading has been dampened by the Memorial Day holiday, with futures largely unchanged across the curve despite some more negative vibes being eschewed by the President on US-China trade. With little to look forward to for the day ahead besides cursory US-Sino comments, alongside closed pit trading and an early electronic trade close of 6pm, trade has been light thus far, with investors likely looking forward to Tuesday’s US Consumer Confidence release.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> (-0.5%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (+0.1%) are mixed with the former subdued amid fears of a supply glut in the US, whilst the latter is supported amid rising political tensions in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Brent/WTI spread has also widened to USD 10.40/bbl vs. USD 9.55/bbl at the front-end of last week. News flows has been light for the complex thus far, with traders keeping an eye on Dollar action and macro developments to influence energy prices. Elsewhere, Gold (+0.1%) is little changed having moved in a USD 4/oz range thus far amid little news, while in terms of tech levels, the yellow metal’s 50 DMA stands at USD 1288.57/oz and 21 DMA at USD 1282.88/oz. Looking at base metals, copper continues its rebound from near-YTD lows amid the risk-appetite in the market, whilst Dalian iron ore surged in excess of 5% to hit new highs since 2013 as port stocks continue to drop alongside renewed fears of a potential dam collapse in Brazil. Iron ore at Chinese ports shrunk to the lowest in over to years according to SteelHome data, whilst Vale’s recent warnings about a potential dam collapse Minas Gerais also bolstered steel prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Buck has gained traction in recent trade amid thin liquidity and a lack of catalysts due to UK and US traders enjoying a long weekend. The Buck was little fazed by comments from US President Trump at the US-Japan presser in which he noted that the US is not ready for a trade deal with China yet. The Dollar index has picked up some steam recently, albeit remains within a 97.55-70 range with only potential macro newsflow to eye throughout the day.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency is little changed as the dust settles from the European Parliamentary elections in which prelim results indicated a shrinking in the centrist parties which have fallen short of the majority needed in the 751-strong assembly. Eyes will now be set on a coalition building process and the follow-through from the nomination of a European Commission President (following Juncker’s departure on October 31st) to the ECB President (EC and ECB Presidents are unlikely be from the same country). In terms of potential coalitions, the main scenarios are touted, with 376 seats needed for majority: 1) EPP, Socialists, Liberals, Greens (506 seats), 2) EPP, Socialists, Liberals (436 seats), 3) EPP, Socialists, Green (399 seats). Nonetheless, EUR/USD fluctuates on either side of 1.1200 and within a relatively narrow 1.1190-1215 band with just over 600mln in option expiries scattered between strike 1.1175-1200. Over on the other side of channel, the Pound also trades with flat on the day, albeit off highs and closer to the bottom of a 1.2715-55 range vs. the Greenback with recent downside in Cable attributed to a slight pickup in the Dollar</p><p><strong>CHF, JPY</strong></p><p>The “risk-on” mood coupled with the thin liquidity has sparked an unwind in risk premium with both currencies underperforming in the G10 space and losing vs the USD and EUR. EUR/CHF currently remains near the top of the currency intraday range of 1.1220-56 whilst USD/JPY found some support at the 109.50 level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, CAD, NZD</strong></p><p>Again, little movement in the currencies due to a lack of catalysts and Europe’s largest FX trading hub away on Bank Holiday. The risk currencies seem to take the cue from the Dollar for now with all three pairs vs. Buck trading within a 20 pip intraday range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira remains in the spotlight amid the CBRT’s continuing attempts to stem its depreciation. Latest effort involve hiking the RRR for FX deposits by 200bps to withdraw liquidity USD 4.2bln in liquidity from the market. The move seeped some strength into the TRY with USD/TRY now around 6.0500 having fluctuated within a 6.0350-1000 range thus far.</p>",

The main takeaway from the mainland elections comes from Italy, however, which saw League gain ground and develop a vociferous lead over their coalition partners with this sparking more concerns over the stability of their agreement. 10yr BTP futures trade with losses of about 10 ticks and remain the loss leader in Europe, as the benchmark hangs around the 131.00 level with the May 17th 130.31 high eyed up next on the downside.</p><p>US debt trading has been dampened by the Memorial Day holiday, with futures largely unchanged across the curve despite some more negative vibes being eschewed by the President on US-China trade.

The greenback’s major counterparts held on to recent gains with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> above 1.1200 despite the European Parliament Election results which showed the centrist parties remained by far the dominant force in Europe but failed to achieve a majority for the first time since the 1970s as liberals, greens and Eurosceptics gained some ground, which therefore shifts focus on coalition building. Nonetheless, this failed to dent EUR/USD given the unlikelihood for any major fallout across the national level aside from Greece where PM Tsipras called for a snap election after his party trailed the main opposition by as much as 9 points. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> stabilized after last Friday’s swings through peaks and troughs triggered by PM May’s resignation announcement, with the UK also closed for holiday and participants awaiting who will emerge the victor in a crowded race to be PM May’s successor. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> attempted to nurse losses and eyed 109.50, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were flat around last week’s highs amid the mixed risk tone and weak greenback.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities were mixed with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures subdued as it retreated further away from resistance at the USD 59.00/bbl which also follows the recent slump in which trade related fears and bearish inventory data spurred a 9% drop last week. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> held near the prior day’s best levels as a weaker greenback provided a platform for the precious metal, while <strong>copper</strong> also saw mild gains as sentiment in mainland China gradually improved and amid strength in <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> ore futures which surged over 5% shortly after the open due to ongoing supply concerns.</p><p>Baker Hughes (May 24) US oil rigs -5 at 797, US nat gas rigs +1 at 186, total US rigs -4 at 983.

In early trade, the dip was attributed to profit taking, and in European trade, the complex took its cue from the Gilt, after UK PM May announced a timeline for her departure. After Europeans left, sideways trade resumed, with Thursday's ranges largely remaining intact. Major curve spreads tightened at settlement.

ASX 200 (-0.1%) was indecisive with strength in mining names offset by losses in financials although Vocus shares surged around 20% after the telco was approached by EQT Infrastructure for AUD 5.25/Shr which is around 35% premium to Friday’s close. Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) was positive but with price action contained by recent currency moves and after President Trump suggested a US-Japan trade deal can wait until after the Japanese upper house elections in July. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) were subdued following weak Industrial Profits data which declined by 3.7%, although some of the losses were later pared as the stats bureau attributed the decline in profits to a rush increase in production prior to a VAT cut as well as a high 2018 base, while the PBoC also injected CNY 80bln of liquidity via reverse repos. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as they mirrored the recent sideways price action in T-notes and with the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1tln of JGBs counterbalanced by the lack of safe-haven demand in Japan.</p>",

Nonetheless, this failed to dent EUR/USD given the unlikelihood for any major fallout across the national level aside from Greece where PM Tsipras called for a snap election after his party trailed the main opposition by as much as 9 points. Elsewhere, GBP/USD has stabilized after last Friday’s swings through peaks and troughs triggered by PM May’s resignation announcement, with the UK also closed for holiday and participants awaiting who will emerge the victor in a crowded race to be PM May’s successor.
