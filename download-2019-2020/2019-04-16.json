Capital Economics notes that the (relatively) unchanged print on the month was grim, but was still an improvement on January and February data. \"March output was dragged down by a 2.5% M/M decline in motor vehicles and a 2.2% M/M fall in wood products - those declines were offset by a 1.0% M/M rebound in petroleum products and a 1.1% increase in computers &amp; electronics.\" It also notes that \"mining output fell by 0.8% M/M, although thanks to a decline in oil and gas extraction, with mining support services (aka drilling activity) posting a small rebound.\" CE argues that with crude oil prices rising sharply in recent months, it expects mining output to return to consistent growth in the second half of this year. \"The US manufacturing surveys have weakened, but have not collapsed into recessionary territory so, with signs of a nascent recovery in other parts of the world, we expect US manufacturing output growth to turn positive again, but the gains are likely to be pretty modest.\"</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>NEC Director Kudlow said on Tuesday that the US are continuing to make good progress on China talks, with talks set to continue this week. Kudlow went on to say that everything is still on the table. Reports from China suggested that it was mulling the removal of bans on imports of US poultry and pork products, coming after yesterday’s reports it was looking at shifting tariffs off agricultural products.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Rosengren (voter, hawk) </strong>overnight said despite some deceleration from last year, the pace of growth in economic activity will be enough to bring further reductions in the unemployment rate. He also suggested that the Fed should be cognizant of financial stability concerns, whilst noting that P/E ratios appear a little rich. Rosengren also highlighted the importance of the Fed shifting its balance sheet holdings into shorter-dated US Bills. <strong>NEC Director Kudlow</strong> says Fed nominee Herman Cain still has the confidence of US President Trump for a seat on the Fed Board, adding that it will be up to Cain if he wants to remain a candidate; On nominee Stephen Moore, Kudlow said that the White House still supports his candidacy and will allow the vetting to continue. Kudlow also added that the White House is still speaking to a number of candidates for Fed seats, beside Cain and Moore. The Fed’s latest <strong>Discount Rate Minutes</strong> showed all 12 Federal Reserve Banks support keeping discount rate steady before March policy meeting, no sentiment expressed for changing rate; Fed directors had mixed reports on global economic conditions, saw less trade concerns amid global uncertainties.</p><p><strong>* UPCOMING CHINA DATA PREVIEW:</strong> Overnight, China will release GDP (exp 6.3% vs 6.4% prior), IP (exp 5.9% vs 5.3% prior) and retail sales data (exp 8.4% vs 8.2% previous). February and March PMIs have signalled some stability in the world's second largest economy, which has helped the yuan to remain stable through trade negotiations with the US, which has in turn had a stabilising impact on other FX, and traders will be looking to activity data next week to reflect that. The latest IMF WEO saw its global growth view revised lower; however, its China growth view was revised up slightly for 2019, offering some hope. Authorities' liquidity injections are likely to support. Industrial production is seen rising 6.0% Y/Y from a previous 5.3%, while fixed asset investment is also seen picking up.</p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES:</strong> Sources said that some ECB policymakers believe that the central bank’s economic projections were too optimistic. Separately, ECB's officials are reportedly lacking enthusiasm for sub-zero tiering of rates, while there has been no talks to cut the deposit rate, according to sources.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 0.65 HIGHER AT USD 64.05/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLED USD 0.54 HIGHER AT USD 71.72/BBL. </strong>Crude markets had a choppy Tuesday, paring gains after a choppy US cash equity open, before drifting higher later into the session. As usual, there were several arguments to be made on both sides of the coin for today’s price action. Where in regard to the earlier sell off, analysts at PVM commented, “uncertainty over OPEC+ production strategy in 2H19 keeps upward pricing pressures at bay. Recent hints from the Russians that output might be increased has cast a dark cloud over the oil balance in the second half of the year.” Commenting on the volatility of the market, Citi analysts highlight, “light book squaring ahead of US weekly inventory data, also expected to show mixed seasonal swings.” Although Citi goes on to remind us that “the market has really just been consolidating near the highest level since November, ready to pivot in either direction,” with the day’s range rather modest. Participants are likely to be treading carefully ahead of the US energy inventory data, where the API will release their data initially after today’s close ahead of DOE data on Wednesday. Currently, crude stocks are seen building 1.7mln bbls, and the products are both forecasted to draw: distillates by 0.8mln bbls and gasoline by 2.1mln bbls. Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks to draw by a chunky 2mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.0% at 2906, NDX +0.3% at 7655, DJI +0.3% at 26453. SECTORS: Communications +0.7%, Cons Discretionary +0.5%, Cons Staples +0.0%, Energy +0.64%, Financials +1.4%, Healthcare -2.0%, Industrials +0.6%, Materials +0.5%, Tech +0.5%, Telecoms +0.2%, Utilities -1.4%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) may be close to a settlement over royalty dispute, which could see Qualcomm receive billions, CNBC’s Faber reported citing sources.<strong> </strong>Boston Scientific (BSX) shares fell after reports emerged that the FDA was ordering manufacturers of surgical mesh to remove devices from the market within 10 days. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) jumped after the health care co. reported earnings that beat analyst expectations, with EPS and revenue beating expectations. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) also moved higher after beating top and bottom lines estimates. Bank of America (BAC) traded lower following after reporting mixed earnings, and a less optimistic outlook. BlackRock (BLK) opened higher on strong earnings. Gaming names (EA, TTWO, ATVI) fell after news emerged that Electronic Arts (EA) had fixed a vulnerability in its Origin gaming platform. Omnicom Group (OMC) shares rose to year-to-date highs after the firm beat profit expectations. Netflix (NFLX) benefitted from an upgrade at Deutsche Bank and a positive mention at JPMorgan, ahead of its Q1 earning report after today’s close. Gold Miners (NEM, GG, GOLD) suffered after gold prices hitting YTD lows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 10+ LOWER AT 122-26+. </strong>Yields rose to 4-week highs on better risk appetite, and ahead of key China data. The complex saw some upside, sympathising with Bunds, after a sources story suggested that some ECB policymakers believed ECB economic projections were too optimistic; a mixed ZEW report didn’t help. Some analysts reported that CTA’s were sellers at the North American cash open, while some programme selling was reported in the 5-year space. And there were also reports that some HFs were squaring their books at the front-end of the curve. Additionally, there was some decent corporate supply, particularly from the banking names, which saw rate locks adding to the downside. At settlement, yields were higher across the curve by between 2bps to 4bps, while major curve spreads were slightly wider, but not by more than 2bps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Another thin range, with EUR trading either side of 1.13 but not daring to venture too far; the German ZEW survey offered some hope of a good reading in PMI data later in the week. Meanwhile, the single-currency contended with multiple sources articles, which net/net leaned slightly dovish. JPY again didn’t fancy venturing too far away from 112.00 ahead of the key China data overnight. AUD is heading into APAC trade flat after the overnight slide, induced by a dovish RBA which seems to be laying out the conditions needed for it to cut rates. Gold was pressured, with traders suggesting the selling was inspired by the S&amp;P 500 creeping up slowly towards record highs, which are around 35 points away. Despite lawmakers being on holiday, GBP was subject to two-way Brexit headline risk, after reports that talks between the government and opposition had broken down (later denied by Labour). USDCAD struggled with 1.34, and the CAD was happy to go along with global risk sentiment, as well as higher crude prices. Investors appear to be becoming more sceptical that Brazil can pass pension reform any time soon, and accordingly, the BRL has lagged the EMFX complex.</p>",

Expectations around IT spending in the broader macro environment will also be of note. Keep an eye on expenses, last qtrs. Higher profits on lower revenues indicates the company has been lowering costs to maintain profits. The debt profile will also be in focus, with net debt hitting USD 33.8bln in Q4.

Meanwhile, the single-currency contended with multiple sources articles, which net/net leaned slightly dovish. JPY again didn’t fancy venturing too far away from 112.00 ahead of the key China data overnight. AUD is heading into APAC trade flat after the overnight slide, induced by a dovish RBA which seems to be laying out the conditions needed for it to cut rates. Gold was pressured, with traders suggesting the selling was inspired by the S&amp;P 500 creeping up slowly towards record highs, which are around 35 points away. Despite lawmakers being on holiday, GBP was subject to two-way Brexit headline risk, after reports that talks between the government and opposition had broken down (later denied by Labour). USDCAD struggled with 1.34, and the CAD was happy to go along with global risk sentiment, as well as higher crude prices. Investors appear to be becoming more sceptical that Brazil can pass pension reform any time soon, and accordingly, the BRL has lagged the EMFX complex.</p>",

As usual, there were several arguments to be made on both sides of the coin for today’s price action. Where in regard to the earlier sell off, analysts at PVM commented, “uncertainty over OPEC+ production strategy in 2H19 keeps upward pricing pressures at bay. Recent hints from the Russians that output might be increased has cast a dark cloud over the oil balance in the second half of the year.” Commenting on the volatility of the market, Citi analysts highlight, “light book squaring ahead of US weekly inventory data, also expected to show mixed seasonal swings.” Although Citi goes on to remind us that “the market has really just been consolidating near the highest level since November, ready to pivot in either direction,” with the day’s range rather modest. Participants are likely to be treading carefully ahead of the US energy inventory data, where the API will release their data initially after today’s close ahead of DOE data on Wednesday. Currently, crude stocks are seen building 1.7mln bbls, and the products are both forecasted to draw: distillates by 0.8mln bbls and gasoline by 2.1mln bbls. Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks to draw by a chunky 2mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar and index have remained relatively stable and rangebound even in the face of sub-forecast US ip data, while other majors and EMs succumb to bouts of volatility and sporadic trade. Indeed, the index has been very pivotal around the 97.000 handle within a 96.877-97.073 band, eyeing the 30DMA at 96.896 and with the Greenback more generally also deriving support from technical/stop sales vs Gold on a break of Usd1280/oz to a new ytd base for spot bullion.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Vying for the dubious position of worst performing G10 currency as the Franc extended losses vs the Buck and Euro amidst broadly risk-on sentiment to 1.0067 and 1.1377 respectively, while Cable never really stuck close enough to hefty 1.6 bn option expiries at 1.3100 to stoke any interest (hedging or defense) let alone trigger them at the NY cut. Instead, the Pound drifted down to test 1.3050 and recent lows just below and did not derive much from the latest UK labour report as the claimant count was not far from expectations and earnings spot on. However, Sterling did succumb to reports about cross party Brexit talks breaking down on immovable red lines and failed to fully recover when the media story was denied, with Eur/Gbp hovering near the upper end of a 0.8654-20 range.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>All ending choppy EU sessions narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Aussie and Kiwi clawed back all and a bit more of their overnight losses in the case of the former. Aud/Usd rebounded circa 40 pips to just shy of 0.7180 and Aud/Nzd reclaimed 1.0600+ status with some traction seen around a piece by RBA watcher McCrann playing down a near term rate cut following dovish minutes and ahead of jobs data on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd recovered from 0.6742 to 0.6738 in wake of remarks by RBNZ Governor Orr underlining an easy stance and now eyeing GDT prices (+0.5% overall and WMP -0.7%) before NZ inflation. Elsewhere, the Loonie also regrouped after adding to yesterday post-BoC survey declines and despite a miss in Canadian manufacturing sales the climb above 1.3350 alongside firmer crude from just under 1.3400 at one stage. A contrasting ZEW survey and conflicting ECB sourced reports sparked Euro volatility around 1.1300, but the single currency unwound recent gains vs the <strong>SEK</strong> and <strong>NOK </strong>amidst heightened risk appetite and the upturn in oil prices noted above. Eur/Sek back down around 10.4500 and Eur/Nok sub-9.5900. Turning to the Jpy, 112.00 continues to act as an anchor as exporter supply and the ytd higher offer resistance vs safe-haven unwinding and JGB-UST yield divergence providing support and bullish momentum on the flip-side.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Turkish ip offered the Lira some comfort and hope of stopping the rot, but ultimately Usd/Try has resumed its almost relentless if not quite inevitable bull run as the AK Party chair confirmed its appeal to overturn the Istanbul election results and rerun the vote. Usd/Try just above 5.8100.</p>",

This lifted the benchmark to a marginal fresh session high of 164.94, with 164.97 cited as the next technical level to look out for on the upside. Gilts also saw similar price action, with the UK benchmark piggybacking on the ECB growth concerns, which saw 10yr brush its Liffe high of 126.99, with little further momentum coming via a decent 2037 auction.</p><p>Stateside, most of the action is being seen in the longer end of the curve, with 10yr futures down 2 ticks on the day and relatively reticent to the ECB source reports.

Hence, Aud/Usd has retreated to retest sub-0.7150 levels and the Aud/Nzd cross is back under 1.0600 even though the Kiwi also took heed of RBNZ Governor Orr reaffirming an easy bias overnight, with Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6750 and now looking to the latest GDT auction and NZ CPI for more direction.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All weaker vs the Greenback as well, with the Loonie still suffering in wake of Monday’s somewhat cautious if not downbeat BoC business survey and extending losses to circa 1.3400 at one stage, while the single currency has lost grip of the 1.1300 handle after topping out around a Fib at 1.1316 yet again. The latest German/EZ ZEW survey was mixed, and the accompanying comments not exactly confident about economic developments, but the final straw for Eur/Usd came via sourced ECB comments suggesting that several members are concerned about forecasts for a growth rebound in H2 and the accuracy of the models used to formulate estimates. The headline pair is now just above another Fib (1.1284), while the Franc has also lost more ground vs the Buck towards 1.0060, but is pivoting 1.1350 vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cable largely shrugged off broadly in line UK jobs and earnings data, but the Pound has drifted away from hefty option expiries at 1.3100 (1.6 bn) amidst a broader Dollar upturn as the DXY reclaims the 97.000 handle, albeit just and to the detriment of the aforementioned weakness elsewhere. Indeed, Usd/Jpy has slipped through 112.00 following another fade ahead of the 2019 peak and amidst export offers layered above the big figure.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Only minor respite for the Lira via better than expected Turkish IP data as Usd/Try remains around 5.8000 and still eyeing recent highs on a mixture of negative domestic factors - political, fiscal and fundamental.</p>",

RBC says that while some of the other headline risks for managed care organisations (MCO) seem to be abating, it expects continued risk over drug pricing until some sort of either regulation (most likely) or legislation (less likely) is passed.</li><li><strong>PREVIOUS EARNINGS REPORT: </strong>Top- and bottom-line beats, driven by Optum, as well as lower expenses; medical cost trends remained well-managed in 4Q18, but management also noted a “still elevated but moderating medical loss ratio (MLR) in some traditional Medicaid programs.”</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Source: Barclays, RANsquawk, RBC, Refinitiv.</i></p><p><strong>NOTE: RANsquawk is trialling this new format for US earnings previews and would welcome your feedback.

In addition, Westpac reiterated its call for August as the most likely time for RBA rate cut and RBNZ Governor Orr also affirmed that a monetary policy easing bias remains in place, while Barclays was sceptical and maintained its view for no rate cuts from both central banks as it sees this week’s New Zealand inflation data and Australian employment figures unlikely to support the case for lower rates.</p><p>RBA Minutes from April 2nd meeting stated the board saw no strong case for near term move in rates but added that a rate cut would be appropriate if inflation stayed low and unemployment trended up, while the likelihood of a near-term rate hike was low given subdued inflation.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) were initially cautious although sentiment has gradually improved with Australia supported amid dovish views on the RBA and with Rio Tinto shares unfazed by weaker production numbers, while the Japanese benchmark just about remains afloat with several telecom names outperforming after reports NTT DoCoMo is to reduce mobile phone rates by as much as 40%. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) gradually pared their opening losses amid the PBoC’s first liquidity injection in almost a month but with upside limited by tentativeness ahead of key Chinese data including GDP, Industrial Production and Retail Sales which are all due out tomorrow.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY briefly reclaimed the 97.00 level to the upside as it benefits from the weakness across its major counterparts including EUR/USD which slipped below near-term support and its 50DMA around the 1.1300 handle, while GBP/USD retreats from resistance at 1.3100 but with a large option expiry of GBP 1.6bln at the aforementioned level helping limit the downside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY mirrors the indecisive risk tone and CAD was pressured after the Business Outlook Survey indicator slipped into negative territory, while AUD/USD gradually declined following the RBA minutes which reiterated the board saw no strong case for a near term move in rates but was downbeat on inflation and suggested that a rate cut would be appropriate if inflation stayed low and unemployment trended up.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid the indecisive risk tone in the region and uneventful price action in T-notes, with participants also sidelined ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>",
