BoE added that monetary policy may need to reinforce expected growth recovery if recent signs of stronger global and domestic activity are not sustained, while it noted that UK potential growth has weakened due to reduced investment and Brexit. However, it assumes an immediate but orderly move at the beginning of next year, to a deep free trade agreement between UK-EU and suggested that risks to GDP are ‘broadly balanced’ and sees support from government budget.</p><p>BoE Governor Carney said UK recovery appears to be on track and indicators of uncertainty have fallen. However, he noted that although global growth is picking up, caution is warranted and that evidence of a pick up in growth is not widespread, while he added that a renewal of trade tensions could reverse progress and coronavirus remains.</p><p>BoE Governor Carney stated that UK economy is 'so far good enough' but data needs to fill in or additional stimulus likely to be required' and future policy moves depend on how economy evolves.

However, Risk appetite ramped up on the tail-end of the WHO press conference, seemingly on the fact that despite the PHEIC declaration, the WHO has said it opposes any travel or trade restrictions to China - participants had feared restrictions would follow the emergency declaration. Therefore, one could anticipate this as a \"soft\" or \"growth/market friendly\" outcome. Furthermore, the WHO stressed that it believed China had taken adequate measures to \"reverse the tide\". Prior to the decision the US CDC confirmed the first human to human transmission of coronavirus in the US, which took the number of confirmed cases to 6 from 5. The new patient is the spouse of the Chicago woman who brought the infection back from Wuhan. Meanwhile the number of cases in China picked up to 8149 from 7711, and total deaths now at 170, while suspected cases are said to have increased to over 12k. The total number of coronavirus cases exceed 8100 worldwide; surpassing the number of SARS cases seen in 2003.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> Heading into this week’s policy announcement, markets were on a “knife-edge” over what to expect from the MPC, with a roughly 50:50 chance assigned to a rate cut vs. hold decision. The uncertainty emanated partially from a slew of dovish interjections from Governor Carney, Tenreyro and Vlieghe; none of which were the in the “cut” camp in December. Furthermore, tier 1 data releases including GDP, retail sales and CPI also led some to call for a rate reduction ahead of the meeting, albeit some of these calls were pared back following more upbeat and timelier indicators including the Markit PMI report. In the end, the MPC opted to stand pat on rates in what was a 7-2 vote vs. analyst consensus of a 6-3 split in views; a decision which saw an unwinding of some of the dovish bets placed in the market. Focus for the accompanying minutes from the meeting was placed on the Bank’s decision to drop its reference to “limited and gradual” rate rises and instead guide towards the possibility of “some modest” tightening of monetary policy further out if the economy recovers as forecast; something the Governor later clarified as implying that multiple rate rises in the future is no longer the case; ING noted that “while the debate on tightening is clearly some way off, this may nevertheless be taken as mildly hawkish by some in the market”. Furthermore, from a stimulus perspective, policymakers reiterated their willingness to act by stating that monetary policy “may need to reinforce expected growth recovery, if recent signs of stronger global and domestic activity are not sustained”. This will make upcoming data increasingly important as markets look to gauge the extent of the post-election “bounce”. Note, the lack of MPC members switching to the “cut” camp could imply that the BoE views activity as picking up at the start of the year; during the press conference, Carney suggested that the UK recovery appears to be on track, albeit, UK growth and inflation are not yet “assured”. This is something that was reflected by the MPR projections which saw noteworthy reductions to 2020, 2021 and 2022 growth prospects, whilst inflation forecasts were raised in the near term but lowered further down the curve. That said, Carney downplayed the importance of projections in the November press conference given the uncertainties facing the UK economy. Of note, naturally, one of those largest uncertainties is in the form of Brexit, on which, the MPC continues to assume “an immediate but orderly move, at the beginning of next year, to a deep free trade agreement between the UK and the EU”; in-line with government policy. Overall, ING concludes that policy easing cannot be totally ruled out this year, however, the fact that no policymakers switched to the rate cut camp this week, shows that the MPC is more likely to stand pat on rates in the coming meetings.</p><p><strong>* US GDP &amp; PCE ADVANCE (Q4): </strong>Headline US GDP growth came in at 2.1% in Q4, in line with the consensus. The core PCE deflator rose 1.3%, missing the consensus 1.7%. Consumer spending rose at a rate of 1.8%, from the prior 3.2%. Oxford Economics argued that the headline gives the illusion of an economy chugging along at a moderate pace, but the breakdown reveals a softer picture: \"More than 70% of the Q4 advance in output came from a temporary collapse in imports, while business investment remained subdued and consumers spent more cautiously,\" the consultancy writes, \"the new decade will bring about sub-potential GDP growth around 1.7% as numerous headwinds keep businesses side-lined while households reduce their outlays in line with gently cooling income.\" In terms of policy implications, the Fed will likely take the report as confirmation that the economy is in a good place and policy is appropriate, but OxEco argues that disappointing growth in early 2020, along with sub-2% inflation, as well as tightening in financial conditions, will lead a dovish Fed to provide additional policy accommodation in mid-2020.</p><p><strong>* UK/US TRADE: </strong>US Secretary of State Pompeo stated that the US intends to put the UK at the front of the line on trade, adding that he thinks the US-UK relationship is at a fantastic place. Pompeo’s tone is more positive here, despite the UK's decision to accept limited Huawei influence on UK's 5G network, which was thought to strain relations between the two sides; other US officials have warned previously of consequences for the UK if it were to accept Huawei into its 5G infrastructure. Furthermore, in a Fox interview, US Commerce Secretary Ross said there is a reasonable chance that a US-UK trade deal can be achieved prior to a pact with the EU, although he caveated his point by saying that the UK’s Huawei decision was too lenient.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN CPI PRELIM (JAN):</strong> Headline inflation rose to 1.7% Y/Y from 1.5%, matching the consensus. The harmonised measure rose to 1.6% Y/Y from 1.5%. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the v-shaped recovery in German inflation is complete, but the consultancy doubts that it will unsettle markets or the ECB. January's upside was a result of higher food and energy costs. Pantheon notes that the estimate for the core rate in this report, but making inferences from other data, says it likely fell to 1.4% Y/Y from 1.7%. \"If our estimate of the core rate is correct, it is now a bit under our estimate of the trend, at 1.5-to-1.6%,\" Pantheon says. Elsewhere, it thinks the headline rate will remain elevated through Q1. \"Energy inflation tends to lag oil prices a bit in Germany, indicating that it will remain sticky in the next few months even as the Y/Y growth rate in oil prices wane.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.19 LOWER AT USD 52.14/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 1.58 LOWER AT USD 57.33/BBL:</strong> The energy complex’s decline continued Thursday as the macro narrative shifted back to the ongoing coronavirus. Prices got off on the back-foot overnight amid headlines alluding to the growing number of cases and deaths, where the latest concerns stemmed from the CDC announcing the first human-to-human transfer in the US. Meanwhile, the US Advance Q4 GDP print was strong in the headline, although the details under the hood were less so, and some additional equity pressure on the US cash open dug the heel in for the oil market’s losses, which by settlement, had been offered more severely than equity futures. Meanwhile, OPEC sources suggested that the group had begun discussions on advancing forward the OPEC+ meeting to early February from March due to the price declines, but no final decision has yet been made – the supply side of the oil market has had little bullish impact as of late amid the coronavirus related demand concerns, where the market has OPEC support priced in. Citigroup notes that it has seen two-way flows, where some participants have been continuing to “buy the dip” as they see the weakness in recent weeks as overdone, although the strategy has yet to prove successful. The bank also highlights that book squaring could be at play ahead of March Brent, February heating oil and February RBOB gasoline contract expiry on Friday.</p><p>*<strong> CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.32% at 3284, NDX +0.26% at 9299, DJI +0.43% at 28,859</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) surged following EPS and revenue beats whilst highlighting its goals, such as increase Model 3 production at its Shanghai facility, increased Model Y production at Fremont, whilst noting Model 3 and Y capacity from Fremont should reach 500k per year after expansion by mid-2020.

Southwestern Airlines (LUV) was hit after reports in WSJ stated the airline had flew passengers on jets with unconfirmed maintenance records, where over 17mln passengers had been flown over a two-year period.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) SETTLED 9+ TICKS HIGHER AT 131-10: </strong>The T-PLEX was firmer across the curve on Thursday, albeit off its highs into the settlement.

By settlement, yields were approximately 3bps lower across the curve</p><p><strong>* BOC’S BEAUDRY:</strong> Bank of Canada’s Beaudry appears more hawkish than the BOC median, arguing that even if a rate cut seems desirable in the short-term, once growth is factored in the cut may no longer be attractive. Beaudry also highlighted that last October, the BoC could have considered a rate cut to make sure the economy didn't under-perform; but given the state of financial vulnerabilities, it judged the risks of acceleration to house price expectations and debt build-up as too high. Note, in the latest press conference Poloz was cognizant of financial vulnerabilities when considering a rate cut. To conclude, Beaudry highlighted that the main financial vulnerabilities are tied to balance sheets, asset prices and risk allocation.</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> <strong>GBP</strong> an outperformer following the BoE rate decision which was not as dovish at some had anticipated with only Saunders and Haskel dissenting, despite expectations for a 6-3 split. <strong>USD </strong>lost its ground amid broad GBP strength, however GDP did little to help despite a headline beat as it saw weak internals. <strong>CNH</strong> remained weaker against the buck as coronavirus cases continue to rise and as the WHO declared the virus as a PHEIC, however they opposed a limit to trade and travel to China. <strong>CAD</strong> initially traded weaker against the buck however comments from BoC’s Beaudry who suggested even if a rate cut seems desirable in the short term, once growth is factored in, the cut may no longer be attractive. AUD and NZD found no reprieve and continued to lose ground against the dollar, with NZD breaching its 200dma at 0.6510 to eventually cross the round figure in the tail end of trade. Meanwhile, AUD found support within a whisker of 0.67 before regaining traction slightly. JPY and XAU ended the day relatively flat against the greenback, after a bid into the havens on continued coronavirus contagion, before paring back amidst a ‘dovish’ PHEIC declaration on the coronavirus. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker across the board, with the ZAR hampered by reports of further load shedding by state utility Eskom, and RUB on a decline in oil prices.</p>",

The consumer sector has remained firm, with November and December US Retail Sales figures not sounding any alarms; furthermore, Cyber Monday and Black Friday have seen record-beating figures again in 2019 and Amazon itself has provided an olive branch to consumers with its shift to free one-day shipping – seeing the street’s Q4 Revenue expectation lie at the top-end of the Co’s Q3 guidance. Meanwhile, the market will be paying close attention to AWS growth in the competitive and grossing cloud sector – note Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure printed forecast-beating growth in its report on Wednesday and concerns linger on AWS’ dominance in cloud infrastructure.</p><p>Analysts on the street generally expect a strong quarterly report despite the shortened holiday calendar, Wedbush’s Pachter (Outperform, USD 2,000 PT) believes if there were to be any weakness, Third Party would likely be the culprit; many cite free one-day shipping as a tailwind, although BMO’s Salmon (“Outperform”, USD 2,150 PT) believes the quarter will mark the peak for the feature. Expectations are a bit more subdued for AWS’ trajectory however, with apprehensions that the unit’s margins could come under pressure. Credit Suisse’s Ju (“Outperform”, USD 2,100 PT) notes that AWS is poised to aggressively pursue larger enterprise clients, but its operating margin will likely compress before heading higher, in addition to the likely entering of a period of structurally lower margins. Going into the report, Wells Fargo’s Fitzgerald (“Overweight”, USD 2,300 PT) believes expectations may be somewhat muted for the quarter and the Q1 guide, seeing slightly faster AWS growth.</p>",

Prices got off on the back-foot overnight amid headlines alluding to the growing number of cases and deaths, where the latest concerns stemmed from the CDC announcing the first human-to-human transfer in the US. Meanwhile, the US Advance Q4 GDP print was strong in the headline, although the details under the hood were less so, and some additional equity pressure on the US cash open dug the heel in for the oil market’s losses, which by settlement, had been offered more severely than equity futures. Meanwhile, OPEC sources suggested that the group had begun discussions on advancing forward the OPEC+ meeting to early February from March due to the price declines, but no final decision has yet been made – the supply side of the oil market has had little bullish impact as of late amid the coronavirus related demand concerns, where the market has OPEC support priced in. Citigroup notes that it has seen two-way flows, where some participants have been continuing to “buy the dip” as they see the weakness in recent weeks as overdone, although the strategy has yet to prove successful. The bank also highlights that book squaring could be at play ahead of March Brent, February heating oil and February RBOB gasoline contract expiry on Friday.</li></ul>",

To recap, the January meeting was widely deemed to be ‘live’ given easing prospects boosted by a string of comments leaning towards the 2 existing 25 bp cut advocates, but Governor Carney, Tenreyro and Vlieghe all opted to remain within the on hold fold, leaving Saunders and Haskel in the minority again. Cable hit fresh highs just shy of 1.3100 and briefly breached the big figure as the press conference and Q&amp;A underscored reasons for refraining from policy action and retaining the option to tighten if necessary even though official guidance for gradual hikes was removed, while Eur/Gbp reversed further within a circa 0.8487-13 range.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/USD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding some waning of broad risk aversion from extremes prompted by the latest and increasingly worrying Chinese coronavirus updates, the usual beneficiaries during safety flights are still in demand, as Usd/Chf pivots 0.9700, Eur/Chf straddles 1.0700 and Eur/Usd holds above 1.1000, albeit against the backdrop of a generally softer Dollar post-FOMC and above forecast German data (preliminary headline inflation and unemployment over conflicting Eurozone sentiment indices.

However, as the death toll and number of cases (confirmed or suspected) continue to mount, Usd/CNH has rebounded further to temporarily test and breach the psychological 7.0000 mark alongside more pronounced depreciation in EM currencies overall, and especially those closely connected or correlated to commodities that are prone to steep price declines on the probability of depressed demand. Hence, the Greenback may well retain a relatively firm underlying bid ahead of data in the form of advance Q4 GDP and initial claims even though a French bank is flagging mild month end selling for portfolio rebalancing purposes.</p><p>CHF/EUR/JPY/XAU - The renowned, but not always reliable or consistent safe and pseudo safe havens are all outperforming, and particularly the Franc that has been flagging of late. Usd/Chf has retreated towards 0.9700 and Eur/Chf is back below 1.0700 as the single currency remains heavy on the 1.1000 handle within a spread of hefty Eur/Usd option expiries stretching from 1.0985 (1.3 bn) through 1.1000-05 (1.7 bn) to 1.1045-50 (1.1 bn). Note, firmer German state CPIs, solid jobs data and rather mixed Eurozone sentiment indicators have all hardly impacted, but the Euro did get a boost from more month end cross buying vs the Pound at one stage (into 9 am fix as usual). Meanwhile, the Yen has bounced over 109.00 ahead of a raft of Japanese macro releases and Gold remains bid between Usd1575-82/oz parameters.</p><p>NOK/NZD/AUD/CAD/GBP - A triple blow for the Norwegian Krona as a steeper retracement in crude prices against the backdrop of heightened risk aversion combines with a big retail sales miss to propel Eur/Nok beyond resistance around 10.1200 and close to 10.1500. Similarly, the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie have all declined through deeper chart support and/or significant levels vs their US counterpart, at 0.6500, 0.6737-25 and 1.3200 respectively, with the latter now eyeing Canadian average earnings for some independent impetus.

Ahead, aside from super Thursday, the first look at US Q4 GDP, weekly claims, a BoC speaker and a slew of Japanese data.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Another downbeat session or the energy complex thus far, with prices weighed on by on the ongoing demand implication of the coronavirus, rise in US crude stocks as per yesterday’s DoEs and with the current sentiment also providing further pressure on the contracts. <strong>WTI Mar’20</strong> futures found an overnight base at around 52.30/bbl ahead of the Monday’s (and January) low at 52.20/bbl, whilst its Brent counterpart hovers around the 59/bbl at time of writing, with support seen at 58.50/bbl – which marks the January low and has been tested twice this week. On the OPEC -front, the Algerian Energy Minister alluded to the possibility that the March confab will be brought forward to February amid the effect of the Wuhan flu on outbreak on prices, and added that an extension to the output cut pact is possible – no dates have been flagged for a February meeting yet. Moreover, OPEC members are said to be preparing a report on the virus’ impact on energy prices for members to review. Elsewhere,<strong> spot gold</strong> prices retain an underlying bid, part-aided by the FOMC’s decision yesterday ahead of today’s BOE and WHO presser. <strong>Copper</strong> prices sees continued downside pressure amid the ongoing coronavirus woes – on a sentiment and demand front with the latter a function of border closures to China.</p><p>World Gold Council noted annual gold demand fell 1% Y/Y in 2019 to 4355.7 tons, while it expects India 2020 gold demand to rebound this year from a 3yr low in which it sees India gold demand at 700-800 tons vs. Prev. 690.4 tons last year but will remain below the 10yr average of 843 tons.

Similarly, the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie have all declined through deeper chart support and/or significant levels vs their US counterpart, at 0.6500, 0.6737-25 and 1.3200 respectively, with the latter now eyeing Canadian average earnings for some independent impetus. Conversely, Sterling has staged a stoic recovery to reclaim 1.3000+ status in Cable terms and pare some lost ground vs the Euro within a 0.8454-87 band on short covering and position/hedge tweaking ahead of the BoE at high noon as expectations for a 25 bp rate cut or no move flit either side of evens – check out our full preview of super Thursday via the Research Suite.</p><p>EM - More pain for regional currencies, but added angst for the Lira as the CBRT Governor echoes Turkey’s Finance Minister with regard to deeming the Try competitive at current levels (circa 5.9800), while maintaining projections for CPI to decelerate further and hit target over the forecast horizon.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It remains to be seen if the dip in debt futures proves transitory or more terminal, and the looming UK rate decision could be crucial if not the determining factor in that regard. Bunds are holding around 174.42, Gilts some ¼ point down from their high (poignantly perhaps given the tight call for -25 bp or nothing from the MPC) and 10 year T-notes just shy of the 131-12 overnight best, while Italian BTPs have recovered from a degree of auction-related selling within 147.41-147.87 confines.

On the OPEC -front, the Algerian Energy Minister alluded to the possibility that the March confab will be brought forward to February amid the effect of the Wuhan flu on outbreak on prices, and added that an extension to the output cut pact is possible – no dates have been flagged for a February meeting yet. Moreover, OPEC members are said to be preparing a report on the virus’ impact on energy prices for members to review. Elsewhere, spot gold prices retain an underlying bid, part-aided by the FOMC’s decision yesterday ahead of today’s BOE and WHO presser. Copper prices sees continued downside pressure amid the ongoing coronavirus woes – on a sentiment and demand front with the latter a function of border closures to China.</p>",

Meanwhile, the Pound is broadly weakening partly on the shift in rate cut prospects to 50%-plus from just above evens and also due to more Eur/Gbp cross positioning for month end. Looking at price action in depth, Gilts gapped up to 135.31 immediately and extended gains to 63 ticks at a fresh 135.52 contract high before waning alongside Bunds in wake of a tentative bounce in EU equities and firm y/y inflation from the German state of Saxony, while the 3 month strip is just off best levels between 2-4 ticks above parity.</p>",

Furthermore, <strong>Powell stated Fed is not satisfied with inflation running below 2% which is not a ceiling </strong>and that the Fed will know when adjustments to the balance sheet have run course when reserves are durably at a sustainable level, while he suggested that <strong>reserves will not fall below September levels with USD 1.5tln level serving as a floor </strong>and that asset prices were “somewhat elevated”.</p><p>The reaction was mixed as <strong>T-Notes firmed slightly</strong> (10y yields down around 2bps), the <strong>DXY eased back</strong> to 98.00 and <strong>XAU added around USD 5</strong> to USD 1575/oz. However, <strong>ES futures eventually saw some modest downside</strong> as there were concerns from some policymakers about the growing balance sheet and Powell noted that asset prices were “somewhat elevated” which would suggest that the Fed might not be so inclined to boost the balance sheet whilst they are \"elevated” and may explain the negative ticks in ES.&nbsp;</p><p>CORONAVIRUS UPDATE</p><p><strong>China reported there are now 7711 total coronavirus cases and death toll at 170, while suspected cases are said to have increased to 12126</strong>. (Newswires) <i>Note, the virus is now in every region of mainland China.</i></p><p><strong>World Health Organization said evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China is deeply concerning</strong> and suggested the numbers outside of China hold the potential for much larger outbreak, while it is to hold an emergency meeting today to re-evaluate whether the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Japanese medical expert said it has been confirmed in China that the coronavirus can be transmitted from people without symptoms</strong>, while there were separate reports that 3 Japanese nationals who returned from Wuhan yesterday have tested positive for the coronavirus. (Newswires)</p><p>White House created a task force on coronavirus in which its members have been meeting daily since Monday, while US President Trump has charged the task force with leading the US government response to the coronavirus. (Newswires) White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said airlines are placing voluntary restrictions on flights to China due to virus outbreak and further restrictions are being discussed. (Newswires)</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian sentiment was downbeat as the overhang from the coronavirus outbreak continued to take its toll across the region</strong> and following an indecisive lead from the US, where markets reacted to the FOMC policy announcement. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.3%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.8%)</strong> were subdued with underperformance across Australian mining names as demand concerns overshadowed the higher quarterly production updates by Fortescue Metals and Newcrest Mining, but with downside for the broader market stemmed by resilience in financials, while losses in Tokyo were exacerbated by flows into the JPY. <strong>KOSPI (-1.9%)</strong> was pressured after index heavyweight Samsung Electronics posted a 38% drop in Q4 net and <strong>Hang Seng (-2.2%)</strong> slipped deeper into correction territory after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the mainland increased to 7711 and the death toll now at 170, while the <strong>TAIEX (-5.8%) </strong>slumped as Taiwan participants returned to the market for the 1st time in 10 days and took their turn to play catch up to the epidemic fears. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher due to the broad weakness in risk appetite and following upside in T-notes which were supported post-FOMC and saw the US 10yr yield decline to a 3-month low, while the mostly improved results from the 2yr JGB auction added fuel to the upside momentum.</p><p>UK/EU</p><p>UK PM Johnson and Chancellor Javid wrote to cabinet ministers to demand savings ahead of the next Comprehensive Spending Review in the Autumn, while they are said to want hard commitments by March 2nd. (Sky News) <i>The report suggests that cuts should be up to 5% of departmental budgets.</i></p><p><strong>UK PM Johnson will inform the EU he is prepared to accept post-Brexit border checks instead of Britain being under EU rules which could mean additional paperwork and physical inspections of goods for businesses.</strong> (Telegraph)</p><p>UK Chancellor Javid will reportedly support the USD 88bln High Speed 2 rail scheme today in a decisive intervention which makes it almost certain the project will go ahead. (FT)</p><p>EU seeks to create a single European data market to challenge dominance of US tech giants, while large online platforms may face new rules to ensure open and fair competition according to an EU document. (Newswires)</p><p>UK Lloyds Business Barometer (Jan) 23 (Prev. 10). (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> saw some mild pressure in reaction to the FOMC before steadying in Asia-Pac trade as it found a base around the 98.00 level and amid rangebound price action in its transatlantic counterparts. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was unchanged ahead of today’s BoE coin-flip meeting and with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> stuck near 1.1000 where there are several hourly MA levels nearby and a EUR 1.2bln option expiry rolling off at today’s New York cut. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> trickled below 109.00 and JPY-crosses remained subdued on the broad risk-averse tone, which also resulted to declines in <strong>antipodeans</strong> despite further pushbacks to rate cut forecasts for both sides of the Tasman.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mostly lower owing to the broad risk averse tone seen during Asia trade which dragged <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures below the USD 53.00/bbl to extend on yesterday’s inventory-driven pressure after yesterday’s EIA report showed a larger than expected build in headline crude stockpiles. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was supported post-FOMC, although prices have since stalled and WGC also noted annual gold demand fell 1% last year, while <strong>copper</strong> underperformed as rising coronavirus cases plagues its largest purchaser China.</p><p>Algeria Energy Minster said it is very possible that the OPEC+ March meeting is advanced to February and that anything is possible when asked about extending the OPEC+ deal, according to state press. (Newswires)</p><p>OPEC is preparing a report on the coronavirus' impact on the oil market for members to review. (Newswires)</p><p>World Gold Council noted annual gold demand fell 1% Y/Y in 2019 to 4355.7 tons, while it expects India 2020 gold demand to rebound this year from a 3yr low in which it sees India gold demand at 700-800 tons vs. Prev. 690.4 tons last year but will remain below the 10yr average of 843 tons. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>Yields were lower across the curve by between 3.5 to 5.5bps, with the belly rallying. Major curve spreads, however, were mixed, with 2s5s, 2s10s, and 2s30s narrowing, while the 5s10s, 5s30sand 10s30s widened slightly. The Fed hiked the IOER but kept its main rate unchanged and extended its purchases through April (See Fed section for details). The complex saw upside as Powell noted that the Coronavirus had the capacity to weigh on China activity, while there were still uncertainties around trade policy. US T-notes (H0) settled 13 ticks higher at 131-00.</p><p>White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said the Fed has been moving in the right direction, but would like them to be bolder, while he also suggested that intensity of EU trade discussions will resume soon.

        "content": "<p>Asia sentiment is downbeat as the overhang from the coronavirus outbreak continues to take its toll across the region and following an indecisive lead from the US, where markets reacted mixed to the FOMC which kept rates unchanged as expected. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) are subdued with underperformance across Australian mining names as demand concerns overshadow the higher quarterly production updates by Fortescue Metals and Newcrest Mining, although downside for the broader market is stemmed by resilience in energy and financials, while losses in Tokyo were exacerbated by flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, KOSPI (-1.0%) is pressured after index heavyweight Samsung Electronics posted a 38% drop in Q4 net and the Hang Seng (-1.6%) slipped deeper into correction territory after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the mainland increased to 7711 and the death toll now at 170, while the TAIEX (-4.7%) slumped as Taiwan participants returned to the market for the 1st time in 10 days and took their turn to play catch up to the epidemic fears.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY saw some mild pressure in reaction to the FOMC in which the Fed stated current policy stance is appropriate and downgraded its view on household spending activity to moderate pace from strong pace, while Fed Chair Powell noted during the presser that the Fed is not satisfied with inflation running below 2% and suggested a USD 1.5tln floor for reserves, but also noted that asset prices were “somewhat elevated”. Nonetheless, the greenback is steady in Asia trade as it finds a base around the 98.00 level and amid rangebound price action in its transatlantic counterparts in which GBP/USD is unchanged ahead of today’s BoE coin-flip and with EUR/USD stuck near 1.1000 where there are several hourly MA levels nearby and a EUR 1.2bln option expiry rolling off at today’s New York cut. USD/JPY trickled below the 109.00 handle and JPY-crosses are subdued on the broad risk-averse tone, which has also resulted to declines in antipodeans despite further pushbacks to rate cut forecasts for both sides of the Tasman.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher due to the broad weakness in risk appetite and following upside in T-notes which were supported post-FOMC, while focus now turns to the 2yr JGB auction results due later.</p>",
