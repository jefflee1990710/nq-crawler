(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Tesla (TSLA) traded above USD 500 for the first time after surging 8% following a note from Oppenheimer which put its PT at a street high of USD 612. The EV maker also benefited after China signalled it will not continue reducing subsidies for the industry at the same pace. Lululemon (LULU) surged ~4% after it raised its EPS guidance which led to a slew of PT increases. Nvidia (NVDA) traded higher following an upgrade at Needham, where the analyst was more constructive on the Co following a meeting with its management, whilst noting his previous downgrade was because of significant global slowdown which would hamper purchases of graphic cards, but now says that 2019 saw an “aggressive channel refill”. Netflix (NFLX) traded higher after analysts at Piper Sandler noted its trackers are pointing towards better than expected domestic and international growth, Piper expect growth of 5.8% (exp. 4.8%) and 31.3% (exp. 30%). Biogen (BIIB) was hit after it announced it is to pay USD 75mln upfront plus the potential for further payments up to USD 635mln for an asset to help its application in Alzheimer’s &amp; Parkinson’s disease. Abiomed (ABMD) weighed on the healthcare sector after falling over 12% after providing disappointing guidance. Illumina (ILMN) also sold off after providing disappointing guidance, where the stock initially fell 5%, although pared to losses of around 3% after it announced a 15-year non-exclusive agreement with Roche (ROGN SW), where it expects high teen China growth as a result of the deal. Elsewhere, Dealreporter announced Elf Beauty (ELF) is reportedly considering a sale, and FedEx (FDX) traded higher after unconfirmed chatter in the name. SPX +0.7% at 3288, NDX +1.16% at 9071, DJI +0.3% at 28,906.</p><p>The TPLEX sold off modestly on Monday in a rather lacklustre session which saw growth in risk appetite, namely equities. The move lower happened primarily in the earlier European session, with EGBs leading the losses and the Treasury curve following suit, seeing Bunds break through some technical levels in absence of major news flow or tier 1 data. The overall sentiment on the Phase 1 deal is leaning towards the positive side in light on recent media reports, with participants anticipating some hard purchases figures in the deal to be released upon signing on Wednesday. This cautious optimism saw the Treasury curve steepen slightly, with the 2-year yield rising 1bps and the 30-year yield up by just shy of 2bps. Attention now draws towards US CPI and the initiation of earnings season on Tuesday for investors to attain a better gauge of economic sentiment. US T-note futures (H0) settled 5 ticks lower at 128-29+.</p>",

Currently, focus is on the downed Boeing (BA) 737-800 craft, which Iranian admitted it accidentally downed; a revelation which has sparked mass anti-government protests in Tehran. Following this announcement, US President Trump on Twitter suggested that protestors should not be killed. As such, focus is now on the measures taken by the Iranian government to dispel protestors, with the remarks from Trump opening the possibility of further action, military or otherwise, in the event force is used to end the protests. It’s also worth recalling the strong rhetoric which continued to emanate from Iran towards the end of last week, which would indicate that the potential for further escalatory actions to be taken by Iran remains. On this, SGH Macro note that ‘the Iranian leadership does not have the appetite to re-ignite tensions with the US in the near term to a level that could trigger another US military response’.</p><p><strong>* US-CHINA: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated that China’s commitments in the Phase 1 deal were not changed during the lengthy translation process and reiterated that it will be released following the signing this week, WSJ reported ahead of the signing/publication of the deal in Washington on Wednesday. Meanwhile, other reports noted that US and China agreed to relaunch their semi-annual dialogue mechanism - previously abandoned as relations broke down – which is also set to be announced on Wednesday. SCMP reported that US business executives have suggested the Phase 1 deal is ‘modest but helpful’, also noting the broad outline of the agreement includes some advances in intellectual property protection, significant agriculture purchases and reduced export barriers. SocGen’s analysts believe Phase 1 is mostly priced in, and as is the consensus, caution that numbers regarding ag purchases and blanks on enforcement and technology must be clarified. On the currency front, it has been reported on Monday that the US will remove the currency manipulator status of China ahead of the Phase 1 signing, in an apparent goodwill gesture. CNBC’s Yoon, citing Chinese business contacts, reported their expectations for the Phase 1 text to include agri and manufacturing purchase targets, tougher trade secrets protections and names of companies that will benefit from reforms. However, they also have concerns, “1) Unclear how deal is enforced. Disputes require individual companies to complain to the US. CEOs may be reluctant to use mechanism out of fear alienating China. 2) Question how realistic purchase targets are. 3) Left out tougher issues so no fundamental change US China relationship.”</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Rosengren</strong> (non-voter, hawk) said the economy faces upside inflation and financial stability risks, something that low rates may induce, adding that the Fed is in a risky place as its stimulative policy is well below the level which is considered to be neutral. <strong>Fed's Bostic</strong> (non-voter, neutral) said the US economy is generally doing fine and the Fed should sit back and let the economy do as it is doing until something changes; he does not see a recession nearby. The Atlanta Fed President said that in the event that businesses are rapidly changing their outlook on hiring and spending, that consumer confidence is weakening and that there are changes in savings, then a change to the policy outlook would be warranted. Bostic echoed other official commentary that there is a pretty high bar for any move to hike rates until inflation moves higher, adding that the Fed needs to guard against a drop in inflation expectations, meaning it will want to let the economy \"run and run hot\".</p><p><strong>* BOC BUSINESS OUTLOOK SURVEY (Q4): </strong>Points to a broadly positive business sentiment, aside from the Prairies where indicators are still weak. Overall, the firmer outlook is supported by expectations of healthy domestic and foreign sales. Indications of future sales are positive, aside from the energy producing regions. Capacity pressures have edged up due to tightening pressures and carry pressures are anticipated to carry over into the next 12-months; firms have frequently been reporting a shortage in specialised labour. Input price growth expectations have turned positive due to commodity prices, indicating price stabilisation in some regions following on from periods of declines. RBC highlights that trade concerns were less prevalent even though the survey was composed prior to the Phase 1 deal was reached, without a Brexit resolution and when there were higher odds of a USMCA ratification. The bank concludes that BoC Governor Poloz’s speech, the December employment report and now the Business Outlook Survey failed to shape the narrative to favour an immediate rate cut from the central bank, citing the muted market pricing for such.</p><p><strong>* BOC SURVEY OF CONSUMER (Q4): </strong>Consumer expectations of 1-year ahead inflation declined slightly in Q4 to 2.2% (prev. 2.4%), most respondents see inflation remaining within the BoC’s target range of 1-3%. Regarding labour market expectations, views were relatively similar to those in Q3, with consumers’ expectations for their wage growth remaining largely stable. Other indicators continue to send mixed signals about the state of the labour market. On household finances, consumers’ expectations for growth of household income were largely stable in Q4; at the same time, their expectations for spending growth increased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLED USD 0.96 LOWER AT USD 58.08/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.78 LOWER AT USD 64.20/BBL: </strong>Crude futures continued their sell off amid the unwinding geopolitical risk, extending past pre-Soleimani levels to reside around levels last seen after the dust settled post the attacks on the Saudi Aramco facilities. Elsewhere, geopolitical concerns in Libya have also taken an ease as a draft agreement between GNA’s Serraj and LNA’s Haftar’s supported an unconditional open-ended ceasefire, however the agreement has reportedly not yet been signed by Haftar as he as requested more time, with the two sides to return on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Saudi’s Energy Minister announced it is too early to discuss whether OPEC+ cuts are to be continued post-March; adding Iraq's compliance has improved in December and is looking for full compliance in January. Crude benchmarks sold off in the early part of the session as US players arrived to their desks, which eventually saw front month Brent futures hover around their 200dma at USD 64.29/bbl. CNPC Research forecasts China 2020 apparent crude oil demand to increase 3.6% Y/Y to 719mln tonnes, while it sees China crude oil imports to increase 4.4% Y/Y to 525mln tonnes.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.7% at 3288, NDX +1.16% at 9071, DJI +0.3% at 28,906; <strong>SECTORS</strong>: Materials +1.36%, IT +1.34%, Communication +0.95%, Industrials +0.89%, Telecom +0.77%, Financials +0.73%, Staples +0.68%, Utilities +0.66%, Discretionary +0.32%, Energy +0.08%, Health Care -0.36%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) traded above USD 500 for the first time after surging 8% following a note from Oppenheimer which put its PT at a street high of USD 612. The EV maker also benefited after China signalled it will not continue reducing subsidies for the industry at the same pace. Lululemon (LULU) surged ~4% after it raised its EPS guidance which led to a slew of PT increases. Nvidia (NVDA) traded higher following an upgrade at Needham, where the analyst was more constructive on the Co following a meeting with its management, whilst noting his previous downgrade was because of significant global slowdown which would hamper purchases of graphic cards, but now says that 2019 saw an “aggressive channel refill”. Netflix (NFLX) traded higher after analysts at Piper Sandler noted its trackers are pointing towards better than expected domestic and international growth, Piper expect growth of 5.8% (exp. 4.8%) and 31.3% (exp. 30%). Biogen (BIIB) was hit after it announced it is to pay USD 75mln upfront plus the potential for further payments up to USD 635mln for an asset to help its application in Alzheimer’s &amp; Parkinson’s disease. Abiomed (ABMD) weighed on the healthcare sector after falling over 12% after providing disappointing guidance. Illumina (ILMN) also sold off after providing disappointing guidance, where the stock initially fell 5%, although pared to losses of around 3% after it announced a 15-year non-exclusive agreement with Roche (ROGN SW), where it expects high teen China growth as a result of the deal. Elsewhere, Dealreporter announced Elf Beauty (ELF) is reportedly considering a sale, and FedEx (FDX) traded higher after unconfirmed chatter in the name.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 5 TICKS LOWER AT 128-29+. </strong>The TPLEX<strong> </strong>sold off modestly on Monday in a rather lacklustre session which saw growth in risk appetite, namely equities. The move lower happened primarily in the earlier European session, with EGBs leading the losses and the Treasury curve following suit, seeing Bunds break through some technical levels in absence of major news flow or tier 1 data. The overall sentiment on the Phase 1 deal is leaning towards the positive side in light on recent media reports, with participants anticipating some hard purchases figures in the deal to be released upon signing on Wednesday. This cautious optimism saw the Treasury curve steepen slightly, with the 2-year yield rising 1bps and the 30-year yield up by just shy of 2bps. Attention now draws towards US CPI and the initiation of earnings season on Tuesday for investors to attain a better gauge of economic sentiment.</p><p><strong>* REPO PREVIEW: </strong>The NY Fed will be conducting another USD 35bln term repo operation on Tuesday, in addition to its regular USD 120bln overnight operation. The operations coincide with 1- and 2-month bill settlements and an USD 8.3bln securities roll-off from a prior term repo. Moreover, participants will be looking to 15:00 EST / 20:00 GMT where the NY Fed will publish its next repo operation schedule, attention gravitating to whether the Fed will cut the size of, or delete, any of the overnight or term operations now that the year-end funding pressures have subsided, although month-end and settlement concerns remain, in addition to corporate tax dates.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> Following last week’s dovishly-perceived leanings from MPC members Carney and Tenreyro, external member Vlieghe gave an interview this weekend in the FT, providing further ammunition to the dovish argument at the Bank. The central banker noted that he is prepared to lower rates if the data doesn’t get better. More specifically, he noted that survey data released towards the end of the month could prove crucial in forming his view over whether to keep waiting for an “economic revival” or to act and lower rates. Note, however, at the most recent MPR press conference, Governor Carney played down the importance of the Markit metrics. Recent “hard” data points saw disappointing growth metrics on Monday, however, the M/M November print was subject to an upward revision to the prior and was before the December election and thus won’t reflect the potential post-election bounce that some have been looking for. With regards to the overall skew of the MPC, Vlieghe thinks it has “been a close call” and wouldn’t take much to swing the debate one way or the other, while he suggested the upcoming few meetings are live. Given that Carney, Tenreyro and Vleighe were not either of the two dissenters at the December meeting, the arithmetic on the MPC has plenty of room to be tilted in a more dovish direction. Note, the next meeting will be on January 30th, alongside the latest MPR; markets currently price in a roughly 50:50 chance of a reduction this month, with a full 25bps cut priced in by November.</p><p>*<strong> UK GDP ESTIMATE (NOV</strong>): dipped to -0.3% on a M/M basis, below the expected 0%, with prior revised to +0.1% from 0%. The Y/Y figure dipped as expected to 0.6%, although the prior was revised higher to 1% from 0.7%. The 3M/3M printed +0.1%, above the expected -0.1%, with prior revised higher to +0.2% from 0%. Pantheon note that the latest metrics are not as bad as they initially appear, due to: upward revisions to the prev. months and the majority of Novembers GDP drop being attributed to temporary weakness in manufacturing and distribution (something that was flagged prior to the release, due to shutdowns ahead of the Brexit deadlines). Stating that QQ GDP for Q4 should print at 0.0%, marginally below the BoE’s forecast of 0.1%. However, in a more pessimistic take, Capital Economics see the UK economy moving towards a Q4 contraction of 0.1%; which, will increase the likelihood of a rate cut. A view which is caveated by this being ‘old news’ so not enough to ensure a cut, focus will be on January’s data releases. In terms of reaction to the release, Sterling was already subdued due to further Dovish MPC comments over the weekend, this time from Vlieghe; but on the release, GBP saw additional downside on the headline miss while gilts strengthened. Albeit, the gilt move was largely retraced, perhaps as debt participants considered some of the above caveats and revisions to the release.</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> slightly softer/flat ahead of CPI tomorrow and Phase One deal signing on Wednesday; DXY traded within the 97.30 -97.50 parameters. <strong>EUR</strong> remained above the 1.11 figure against the buck and tested resistance in EURGBP at 0.8578-92, the Dec. 24th-23rd high. <strong>GBP </strong>breached 1.30 to the downside after weak GDP data and dovish comments from BoE’s Vlieghe, although pared back to around the key level in the tail end of the session. <strong>CAD</strong> little changed on the day where initial strength was seen after the BoC survey’s although gains were shortlived. <strong>CNH</strong> outperforms amid reports US is to remove the currency manipulator tag from China, likely hampering <strong>JPY</strong> which is approaching 110.00 against the buck where hefty barrier interest reportedly lies. <strong>XAU</strong> continues to hover around the 1550 handle amid positive US China updates and a continued unwind in geopolitical tensions, not only in the Middle East, but Libya too. <strong>EMFX</strong> generally weaker against the buck, apart from <strong>TRY</strong>, which continues to benefit from the lower oil prices which in turn is hampering <strong>RUB</strong>. TRY also likely finding support amid the easing tensions in Libya. <strong>ZAR</strong> continued to weaken following reports on Friday of scheduled loadshedding over the weekend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>The major outliers and laggards, as UK data misses in the form of monthly GDP, IP and manufacturing output raised BoE easing expectations to roughly evens for the end of January amidst more dovish MPC rhetoric (Vlieghe seemingly ready to join resident rate cut dissenters Saunders and Haskel unless the economy improves promptly and significantly). Cable extended losses to test support at 1.2960 as Eur/Gbp probed highs from December 24 circa 0.8580 before Sterling pared some losses, and the Yen effectively marched 30 May 2019 lows around 109.93 vs the Dollar before finding some support into 110.00 where hefty barrier interest reportedly lies. To recap, Usd/Jpy rallied when the 109.70-73 resistance area was breached to trigger stops and the Yuan strengthened through 6.9000 against the Buck on US-China trade momentum heading towards Wednesday’s scheduled White House signing of Phase One, plus reports that Washington will remove Beijing from its FX manipulator list as a condition set for the initial deal.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/AUD/CAD/NZD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The rest of the G10 currencies have been relatively rangebound/steady, with the Franc firming gradually vs the Greenback and Euro towards 0.9700 and 1.0800 respectively from 0.9736 and 1.0833 at the other extremes, while Eur/Usd also saw some extension between 1.1138-13 parameters, but never really threatened decent expiry interest either side of that range. Elsewhere, the Antipodean Dollars have been rotating around 0.6900 and 0.6630 with modest upside in the Aud/Nzd cross on the 1.0400 handle as the Aussie derived more impetus from the aforementioned Yuan appreciation than the Kiwi. The Loonie gleaned modest/limited support from the BoC’s Q4 outlook survey within a 1.3033-67 band, as business sentiment beyond the Prairies was broadly positive based expectations of healthy domestic and foreign sales, while most firms forecast inflation to remain within the 1-3% target corridor. Turning to Scandinavia, Sweden’s Crown held up better than its Norwegian peer as crude prices continue to retreat from recent US-Iran inspired highs, and despite dovish remarks from Riksbank’s Jansson questioning the efficacy of December’s ¼ point tightening move.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Against the grain of broad declines vs the Usd, Try outperformance was maintained on the deeper oil retracement noted above and some progress made on the geopolitical front as only Haftar in Libya refrained from signing a deal due to a request for extra time to consider the terms. However, the Rub was hampered by Brent’s dip through the 200 DMA and other regional currencies failed to benefit from the Greenback waning generally as the <strong>DXY</strong> drifted back below 97.500 within a 97.535-327 range.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Today’s Business Outlook Survey comes ahead of next week’s January 22nd policy meeting and MPR release from the Bank.</li><li>The previous release pointed to a slight improvement in business sentiment but noted that regional differences within Canada were becoming more pronounced. Furthermore, the future sales gauge was positive in most regions, foreign demand was positive but was weighed down by trade tensions. The survey also found that plans to invest and hire more in the next year were healthy outside of the energy producing regions. Capacity pressures, meanwhile, were somewhat elevated in some firms due to tightening labour constraints, but firms anticipated that capacity pressures will increase over the next year. Input price growth was expected to soften modestly on the back of less pressure from commodity-related inputs; output prices are seen growing at a slightly quicker rate than over the last year</li><li>Ahead of the release, RBC notes that activity data for October softened into year-end and as such, the Canadian bank looks for a Q4 annualised GDP print of under 1% which would be “materially below” the BoC’s 1.3% projection in October.</li><li>On a more positive footing, Capital Economics notes “The rise in the Markit manufacturing PMI in the fourth quarter suggests that the Future Sales Indicator, which is closely correlated with annual GDP growth, is more likely to rise than fall”.</li><li>However, analysts at Scotia have noted that the sample date was most likely between mid-November through to the first week of December - and therefore the view portrayed of the Canadian economy could be somewhat stale (note, Friday’s labour market report).</li><li>As an addition to the release, the BoC will also be releasing its inaugural Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations. The report will focus on three key areas: 1) consumer inflation expectations, 2) Labour market expectations and 3) Household finances.</li></ul><p><i>Note, from a policy perspective, markets currently price in a 1.5% chance of a rate reduction next week with just under 12bps of loosening priced in throughout 2020. ING suggest that a dovish report could prompt a move in USD/CAD above 1.3100.</i></p>",

(Süddeutsche Zeitung)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>A tentative start to the week for European equities thus far [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%], following on from a similarly mixed APAC session ahead of the looming US-China Phase One deal signing. UK’s FTSE 100 [+0.5%] outperforms its regional peers as a weaker GBP bolsters exporters in the index following further dovish comments from BoE MPC members – this time Vlieghe – in the run up to the Jan 30th BoE confab; as well as UK today’s poor UK GDP numbers. Sectors are relatively mixed with no clear under/outperform in a reflection of the broad overall sentiment. The tech sector [+0.6%] outperforms with some tailwind heading into the Phase One deal signing as US business executives suggest the deal shows some advances on some sticking points such as intellectual property protection, significant agricultural purchases and recued export barriers. In terms of individual movers, UCB (+3.1%) remains one of the winners in the Stoxx 600 after the Co. upgraded its FY19 core EPS and revenue outlooks. Wirecard (+1.7%) is the top gainer in the DAX after Chairman Matthais and the supervisory board chairman stepped down. On the other end of the spectrum, Renault (-3.8%) shares fell to the foot of the pan-European index amid reports that Senior Nissan executives have stepped up the contingency planning regarding a possible split from Renault.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> The Pound was already under pressure and underperforming G10 peers after BoE’s Vlieghe joined the growing ranks of dovish MPC members by signalling his leaning towards a rate cut as soon as this month barring an imminent and significant pick-up in UK growth. However, November GDP fell 0.3% m/m vs the flat consensus to lift January and 2020 easing expectations and push Sterling down further through 1.3000 vs the Dollar and through 0.8570 against the Euro, with the former testing December 27 lows circa 1.2970 and latter approaching Xmas Eve peaks after breaching the 55 DMA (0.8534) and 0.8550.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> The next weakest major link, as stops set around mid and early December highs were tripped to leave the Yen eyeing lows not seen since May 30 last year (109.93) ahead of big 110.00 barriers and technically bearish having fallen below the 200 WMA (109.70). From a fundamental perspective, broadly risk on sentiment awaiting the signing of US-China trade pact Phase 1 and no further US-Iran hostilities has prompted Jpy selling, while Usd/CNH has continued its downtrend to multi-month lows under 6.9000.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/NZD/CHF/CAD -</strong> All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the DXY regains more composure off post-NFP lows within a 97.327-535 range, albeit partly on the aforementioned Pound and Yen depreciation. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.6900, Eur/Usd is hovering above 1.1100 flanked by hefty options (1.6 bn between 1.1095-1.1100 and the same size from 1.1120-40), Nzd/Usd is meandering within 0.6625-52 parameters in the run up to NZIER confidence and building consensts, Usd/Chf is sitting tight in a 0.9723-36 band and Usd/Cad is equally restrained between 1.3046-67 ahead of Canada’s LEI and the BoC’s outlook survey.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> The Norwegian Krona has weakened further alongside oil prices and from a chart perspective as Eur/Nok trades above the 200 DMA to 9.9100+ at one stage, while its Swedish counterpart is also on the back foot close to 10.5900 in wake of comments from Riksbank’s Jansson reiterating his opposition to December’s 25 bp repo hike. However, the Turkish Lira is consolidating recovery gains vs the Buck through 5.9000 even though the current account balance swung into arrears in November and the CBRT is widely forecast to ease again this week, with the Try still cheering cheaper crude costs and the overall appetite for risk noted above.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: <strong>1.1095-1.1100 (1.6BLN), 1.1120-40 (1.6BLN)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GBP/USD: <strong>1.3100-10 (1BLN),</strong> 1.3170 (800M), 1.3200 (712M)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NZD/USD: 0.6590 (227M), <strong>0.6610 (885M)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Gilts have recovered well from a downturn that pushed prices back below 132.00 to sit much closer to the 132.25 Liffe high vs 131.94 low in wake of some worrying GDP and production figures that have lowered the bar for BoE rate cuts this month and for the year as a whole.

WTI futures oscillate on either side of USD 59.0/bbl having already dipped below its 50 DMA at USD 58.81/bbl. Meanwhile, Brent Mar’20 contracts fell below the USD 65/bbl level and briefly dipped below Friday’s low of USD 64.88/bbl ahead of the current 2020 low-print at USD 64.58/bbl. SocGen notes that if the 200DMA (~USD 64.30/bbl) fails to hold, then oil will be put in ranges seen last September- after Saudi managed to put production back online surprisingly quickly after the attacks on Aramco facilities. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> continues to trickle lower and prices temporarily lost the USD 1550/oz psychological figure amid a firmer Buck.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound was already under pressure and underperforming G10 peers after BoE’s Vlieghe joined the growing ranks of dovish MPC members by signalling his leaning towards a rate cut as soon as this month barring an imminent and significant pick-up in UK growth. However, November GDP fell 0.3% m/m vs the flat consensus to lift January and 2020 easing expectations and push Sterling down further through 1.3000 vs the Dollar and through 0.8570 against the Euro, with the former testing December 27 lows circa 1.2970 and latter approaching Xmas Eve peaks after breaching the 55 DMA (0.8534) and 0.8550.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The next weakest major link, as stops set around mid and early December highs were tripped to leave the Yen eyeing lows not seen since May 30 last year (109.93) ahead of big 110.00 barriers and technically bearish having fallen below the 200 WMA (109.70). From a fundamental perspective, broadly risk on sentiment awaiting the signing of US-China trade pact Phase 1 and no further US-Iran hostilities has prompted Jpy selling, while Usd/<strong>CNH </strong>has continued its downtrend to multi-month lows under 6.9000.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/NZD/CHF/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the <strong>DXY </strong>regains more composure off post-NFP lows within a 97.327-535 range, albeit partly on the aforementioned Pound and Yen depreciation. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.6900, Eur/Usd is hovering above 1.1100 flanked by hefty options (1.6 bn between 1.1095-1.1100 and the same size from 1.1120-40), Nzd/Usd is meandering within 0.6625-52 parameters in the run up to NZIER confidence and building consensts, Usd/Chf is sitting tight in a 0.9723-36 band and Usd/Cad is equally restrained between 1.3046-67 ahead of Canada’s LEI and the BoC’s outlook survey.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona has weakened further alongside oil prices and from a chart perspective as Eur/Nok trades above the 200 DMA to 9.9100+ at one stage, while its Swedish counterpart is also on the back foot close to 10.5900 in wake of comments from Riksbank’s Jansson reiterating his opposition to December’s 25 bp repo hike. However, the Turkish Lira is consolidating recovery gains vs the Buck through 5.9000 even though the current account balance swung into arrears in November and the CBRT is widely forecast to ease again this week, with the Try still cheering cheaper crude costs and the overall appetite for risk noted above.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Iranian recap, where we stand and near-term focus",
        "content": "<p><strong>Brief Recap</strong></p><ul><li>Tensions between Iran and the US escalated substantially after the assassination of Soleimani, an IRCG General, in the first few days of the year. Following this, Iran responded by launching missiles at two Iraq-US bases (Al-Asad and Erbil); initial reports indicated no US casualties, which was later confirmed by US Officials, rhetoric out of Iran continued to be punchy threatening to launch more ‘crushing attacks’ and take ‘harsher revenge’ amongst other comments. Stateside, the response out of US President Trump was calm, with the President tweeting that ‘all is well’. Subsequently, Trump in his press conference de-escalated tensions as no tit-for-tat military action was announced. In terms of measures taken, the US on Friday placed additional sanctions on Iran, with the focus on key individuals as well as steel &amp; iron related entities.</li></ul><p><strong>Current Position</strong></p><ul><li>At present, focus has turned to the downed Boeing 737-800 plane; a craft which Iran admitted it shot down by accident due to the craft displaying the flying posture and altitude of a hostile target. Following this, mass protests have been taking place in Tehran with the protesters calling for the Supreme Leader to step-down due to this error. While Trump, or any other senior official, is yet to comment directly on the downed plane after this revelation; Trump did tweet that he doesn’t care if they negotiate and it will be entirely up to them, did suggest no nuclear weapons and that protesters should not be killed. Other nations have condemned the crafts downing, with Canadian PM in particular calling for a full and thorough investigation into how such a tragedy occurred.</li></ul><p><strong>Near-Term Focus Points</strong></p><ul><li>Given the current focus on the Boeing plane and the resulting protests, participants will be keeping a close eye on the measures taken by Iran to dispel/control the protesters; particularly given the aforementioned remarks from President Trump. These comments open-up the potential for a response from the US, potentially in the form of additional sanctions, in the event that protesters are killed; evidently, the worst-case scenario would be Iranian actions generating a military response from the US. In such an event, the risk-off trade that encapsulated last week may well return.</li><li>Protests aside, the strong rhetoric coming out of Iran prior to the implementation of sanctions does leave the prospect of further military action being taken. Although, the grave error of downing a civilian plane may well stay Iran from such measures; at least in the near-term. On this, SGH understand ‘the Iranian leadership does not have the appetite to re-ignite tensions with the US in the near term to a level that could trigger another US military response and, in turn, close the revival of negotiations that Tehran hopes will lead to the lifting of the crippling US-imposed sanction’.</li><li>On a potential deal/agreement, SGH also highlight that ‘Sources with knowledge of Tehran’s thinking believe the bar to an “interim” agreement could now be low, in which a limited, perhaps 90-day, reprieve on some of the oil export sanction exemptions that were eliminated by the US in May 2019&nbsp;would be a first stage “trust building” exercise’. Although, they do caveat that the available window for generating a meaningful de-escalation between the US and Iran is slim.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets begin the week mixed with the region indecisive as it reacts to the recent miss in US NFP jobs data and with Japanese participants away for public holiday, with this week’s US-China Phase 1 deal signing adding to the tentativeness. ASX 200 (-0.5%) suffers from broad losses across its sectors led by underperformance in energy and defensives, while Westpac recently estimated losses from the ongoing bushfires at AUD 5bln and a total impact to domestic GDP of between 0.2%-0.5%. The TAIEX (+0.5%) is lifted following a landslide victory by Taiwanese President Tsai who was re-elected for another 4-year term and with several revenue updates including Acer, Pegatron and TSMC. Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) and Hang Seng (+1.0%) are mixed with underperformance in the mainland after the PBoC once again refrained from open market operations and as the looming Phase 1 signing keeps participants on the fence. Furthermore, the sides were said to have agreed to launch a new semi-annual dialogue mechanism, although not also is rosy with the US to drop its civilian drone programme amid security concerns regarding Chinese tech and with officials to visit the UK in which they expected to pressure it against the use of Huawei equipment.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively stable below the 97.50 level following the slight pullback in the aftermath of the weaker than expected NFP jobs data and wage growth, while its major counterparts are mixed as EUR/USD is virtually unchanged, sandwiched by nearly EUR 1.6bln of option expiries set to roll off later today at 1.1120-30 and with GBP/USD breaking down Friday’s support of 1.3050 after BoE’s Vlieghe suggested he is prepared to lower rates if the data doesn’t get better and that the approaching meetings are live. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher despite the absence of Japanese participants and antipodeans benefit from a stronger CNH heading into the Phase 1 signing and after the PBoC set the strongest reference rate since early August which saw USD/CNH breach 6.9000. TWD was also a notable gainer and rose to its best level since June 2018 after the election victory by President Tsai who also received record-breaking support.</p>",
