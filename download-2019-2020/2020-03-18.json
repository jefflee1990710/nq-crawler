Asian equities could not rise despite the 6% rally on Wall Street on Tuesday, while US futures went limit down in overnight trade. US stocks found some support shortly after the open, although selling pressures continued later in the session, hitting the 7% limit down. Albeit fiscal measures seem poised to help where possible, the world increasingly begins to adjust to a lockdown, with growing expectations, and official suggestions, of hubs such as NYC and London on the cusp of such – measures that will undoubtedly cause severe near-term economic consequences and cause large downgrades to corporate stability. The greenback continues to retain the thrown (DX spiking above 100) as investors worldwide scramble to the door out of other asset classes – note cable was a noted sufferer, falling beneath 1.15 at one point! The oil benchmarks were shed heavily too, seeing WTI reach lows not seen since 2002, settling 24.4% lower, Brent was a relative “outperformer” at -13.4%. The TPLEX continued to bear steepen as the 30-year yield approaches closer to 2%, it fell below 1% just last week; meanwhile, the front-end remains more stable, catching some support from the Fed’s slew of new credit facilities – it revived another ’08 tool overnight, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.</p><h2>COVID-19:</h2><p><strong>US MEASURES: </strong>NEC Director Kudlow said the Phase 3 economic relief bill should bring USD 1.3trln worth of stimulus; prior reports had suggested USD 1.2trln, although details are murky on whether these figures are cumulative of the previous other two fiscal packages. Kudlow went further in his Fox interview to say that if it takes more than USD 1.3trln worth of stimulus, it will be done – even going as far as to say the government could take equity positions in companies! Meanwhile, President Trump announced the Defense Production Act (DPA) will be signed imminently. The measures will provide the President authority to require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense, in addition to a slew of other authoritative powers regarding resources and businesses. Trump also said FEMA has now been activated in all regions. Regarding medical care, he announced two Navy ships to be harnessed, with one hospital ship will be stationed on the West coast and one stationed on the East. Trump said he would hold another news conference either on Wednesday or Thursday regarding the FDA and COVID-19. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is proposing lending to air carriers (AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE, JBLU) from the exchange stabilization fund following the new USD 50bln congressional appropriation, according to a Treasury memo. The administration proposal also seeks USD 150bln for loan guarantees to other distressed sectors, proposes disbursing USD 250bln to taxpayers starting April 6th and another USD 250bln in May; seeking USD 300bln for small business interruption loans.</p><p><strong>MNUCHIN WARNING:</strong> Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has warned lawmakers that the US jobless rate could spike to 20% if no action was taken on a stimulus plan, according to a source, and could leave lasting damage. Mnuchin was making the case for a USD 1trln stimulus package, which would entail sending cheques to Americans within a fortnight. The chief of staff of VP Pence responded Wednesday, saying that no one is forecasting 20% unemployment right now. Although President Trump himself later said that the 20% figure was a “worst-case” scenario but added that the country is nowhere near it.</p><p><strong>CANADA STIMULUS:</strong> Canada announced a CAD 27bln stimulus package for the economy, which amounts to around 3% of GDP. The Canadians will provide CAD 55bln to meet liquidity needs of businesses and households through tax referrals and will provide temporary wage subsidies for up to three months to allow businesses to keep workers on payroll. PM Trudeau said he was willing to do more with economic aid.</p><p><strong>NY SHELTER IN PLACE:</strong> New York City Mayor De Blasio said that military assistance in the city is required, adding that he was almost at the point of recommending \"shelter-in-place\" to NY Governor Cuomo. On Tuesday, De Blasio pushed back on suggestions of a potentially imminent shelter in place order. Elsewhere, New York Governor Cuomo said there are now 2382 cases of the coronavirus in New York (prev. 1008).</p><p><strong>LONDON LOCKDOWN REPORT:</strong> London is facing lockdown as the Government prepares emergency legislation to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to The Telegraph, citing sources close to the Mayor's office. A shutdown could be announced in the coming days. At the daily UK government press conference, schools were instructed to close until further notice on Friday and PM Johnson, when asked whether London would be entering a lockdown, said the government wouldn’t hesitate to move further and faster when necessary, avoiding a direct answer, while also saying it was ruling nothing out.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN MEASURES: </strong>German Finance Ministry and Financial Regulator announced that the anti-counter cyclical capital buffer is to be cut to 0% from 0.25% starting April 1st, new regulations will give German banks a capital boost of over EUR 5bln; rate will stay at 0% until at least the end of 2020. Austria will provide up to EUR 38bln in its aid package; will provide another EUR 9bln in guarantees and warranties, EUR 10bln in tax deferrals, EUR 15bln in emergency aid. French regulators are set to allow their banks to tap their capital buffers which could free up to EUR 8bln; there were separate reports that EU regulators are reportedly weighing measures to give banks relief on bad loans, too.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS:</h2><p><strong>FED PD CREDIT FACILITY:</strong> The Fed has brought back the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), last used in the crisis, which is a secured lending facility allowing the use of various collateral types, namely, Treasuries and agency, IG corporate credit, international agency, commercial paper, municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and equity securities. Loans will be made available to primary dealers for a term of up to 90 days, at a rate equal to the primary credit rate in effect at the Discount Window. The PDCF will remain available to primary dealers for at least six months, or longer if conditions warrant.</p><p><strong>NY FED OPERATIONS: </strong>No Term repo operations from the Desk on Wednesday, although it did carry out its two O/N operations, offering USD 500bln for each. However, the Fed’s persistent efforts to remove funding pressures, such as offering the second O/N operation each day for the rest of the week, in addition to both the new CPFF and PDCF has, for now, kept repo rates in check, thus Wednesday’s operations saw relatively small demand. Note that the Desk will offer USD 45bln in its 14-day Term operation on Thursday, in addition to its ongoing O/N ops.</p><p><strong>ECB: </strong>The GC was reported in the latter session to be holding an emergency call on a COVID-19 response, according to sources, coming shortly after comments from the French Finance Minister calling on the ECB to take on more measures. Earlier on, ECB President <strong>Lagarde</strong>, as cited by FAZ, said she sees EZ GDP falling by 5% if the lockdown is extended. Following comments from ECB's <strong>Holzman</strong> in Der Standard (which appeared to suggest that monetary policy had reached its limits), the central bank said it stood ready to adjust all measures as appropriate and will continue to closely monitor the implications of the coronavirus. Holzmann himself also clarified his remarks, stating that the monetary toolbox was well equipped, and policy had not reached its limit. Meanwhile, ECB's VP <strong>de Guindos</strong> said the central bank stood ready to act with bold measures if necessary, adding that he expects the virus outbreak to have only a temporary impact on economies. ECB's <strong>Schnabel</strong> said the central bank is lowering its growth view, given that we are experiencing a major economic shock; she added that policymakers are closely monitoring credit markets, and are ready to act quickly if necessary. In terms of dollar liquidity, its 7-day operation saw take-up of USD 75.8bln, a huge rise compared to the circa USD 100mln levels that are usually seen.</p><p><strong>ESCB:</strong> Sources said that the ESCB is intervening in the market via the Bank of Italy to ensure orderly market conditions, according to Reuters citing a Bank of Italy official. The interventions are flexible in timing and the markets that they cover, the report noted, and added, that intervention will continue as long as necessary.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>New Governor Bailey fired a warning to markets, stating that investors who are making money by shorting assets against the interest of the UK economy should \"just stop\", though Bailey did not announce any short-selling bans, like other nations in Europe. Bailey said the MPC was watching GBP very carefully, taking note of the recent fall, and said it will consider the effects at the next week's policy meeting. The governor ruled out negative rates, arguing that it would likely hurt lending conditions and confidence, though added that everything was on the table that is reasonable within the policy toolset. Ahead, Bailey said that Covid-19 corporate financing facility was the first step, which the MPC aims to have operational next week, and this facility could be expanded; that facility can effectively buy new debt from companies, he said, but the total size of this is not possible to estimate. When asked about printing money for individuals says nothing is ruled out, but should not be interpreted as indicating they are about to undertake some measures. And he urged firms thinking of firing staff to first speak to the BoE and Treasury about what funding is available.</p><p><strong>BOJ:</strong> Overnight, BOJ Governor Kuroda said Japanese financial institutions were not facing difficulties getting hold of dollars. He also noted that volatility facing Japan was less severe than in the US and in Europe, noting that ETF purchases had tamed volatility (estimated that the BOJ's losses on ETF holdings were probably between 2-3trln yen). Kuroda reiterating that the BOJ was prepared to ease further if required. While noting that the Bank can coordinate indirectly with fiscal authorities.</p><p><strong>RBNZ:</strong> The Kiwi central bank said it would delay or slow most of its regulatory measures for an initial period of six months, and work closely with others to ensure the smooth operation of markets, and credit availability to households and businesses.</p><h2>US ELECTION:</h2><p><strong>DEMOCRAT PRIMARIES:</strong> Former US VP Joe Biden was victorious in all three key Democrat Primaries on Tuesday night, with analysts now suggesting that his lead over Vermont Senator Bernard Sanders is almost insurmountable; the extreme-left Sanders is now facing calls to drop out of the race, which would allow Biden to concentrate on the November election amid the COVID fallout.</p><h2>DATA:</h2><p><strong>CANADA INFLATION:</strong> Data came in largely in line with expectations (+0.4% M/M, +2.2% Y/Y), though analysts noted that the impact of COVID was not fully seen in the survey period, making it easy to look through the data. Inflation will slow in the months ahead, according to Canadian bank RBC, as the downward impact of the virus outbreak and the Saudi-Russia oil price spat on commodity prices, and what will ultimately be a dramatic fall in demand for a large swath of retail and services products flows through beginning more significantly in March. \"Headline CPI could easily test the lows seen over the last five years (sub-1% in 2015),\" the bank said, and \"there could well be some additional downward pressure from discounts offered by coronavirus-affected businesses, though a weaker Canadian dollar (a byproduct of lower oil prices and risk aversion in financial markets) will add to the price of imported goods.\" In terms of policy implications, BOC says this means little in the near-term; \"Lower inflation means the central bank won't feel conflicted about adding stimulus, but supporting the economy through this shock would have been its top priority anyway.\"</p><h2>EQUITIES:</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -5.17% at 2398, NDX -4.00% at 7175, DJIA -6.28%.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -14.24%, Financials -8.85%, Real Estate -7.45%, Industrials -7.1%, Materials -6.17%, Cons Disc -4.92%, Technology -4.59%, Utilities -4.59%, Health -3.38%, Cons Stpl -3.07%, Communication Svs -2.82%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Another extremely volatile day for equities with the VIX making new highs above 85. Airlines saw heavy losses once again as the operators continue to reduce capacity and take cost-cutting measures. Some reports suggest airlines are looking to quickly cut workforces through an early retirement package or unpaid leave for up to one year with medical benefits in a move to reduce costs.&nbsp; Delta Airlines (DAL), one of the worst-hit today, falling over 30% as it expects revenue to fall USD 2bln in March while cutting its system-wide capacity by 70% and reducing pay to its officers and directors by 50% and 25%, respectively. Boeing (BA) was also heavily weighed on after its appeal for USD 60bln in government aid, which includes access to public and private liquidity and loan guarantees for the aerospace manufacturing industry. Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman believes BA would not survive without a government bailout. Elsewhere, Casino operators and retailers continue to close down properties across the US, meanwhile, the hotel industry (H, HLT, MAR, HST) have asked the Trump administration for a USD 150bln bailout, according to WSJ - Bill Ackman believes there is a risk that HLT could go to zero. Detroit’s three largest automakers (GM, F, FCAU) agreed with the UAW to shut down US factories amid the coronavirus threat. Earnings from FedEx (FDX) saw revenue beat expectations, although EPS missed but its CEO stated it is ready to meet the increased demand for its international express export services due to the significant fall in intercontinental air capacity. General Mills (GIS) figures were more or less in line with expectations, although FY20 guidance was weak. Gilead (GILD) was mentioned positively at Piper, suggesting its COVID treatment, remdesivir, could receive FDA approval swiftly.</p><h2>CRUDE:</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 6.58 LOWER (-24.4%) AT USD 20.37/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 3.85 LOWER (-13.4%) AT 24.88/BBL.</strong></p><p><strong>Both WTI and Brent sold off heavily</strong> on Wednesday trade with WTI trading around 20/bbl at the lows, levels not seen since 2002, and Brent at 25/bbl, WTI led the losses falling over 20% resulting in the Arb widening to over 5 bucks for the two products. Soured risk appetite was the key driver as the coronavirus continues to spread and spook markets as borders begin to shut, airlines continue to cut capacity and company operations begin to halt hurting the demand side even further. Also, Saudi Arabia and Russia appear to show no signs of backing down from its pricing war with Saudi’s Energy Minister directing Aramco to continue to supply crude at 12.3mln BPD over the coming months. Elsewhere, London oil giants Shell (RDS.A LN) and BP (BP LN) are reportedly chartering tankers to store fuel at sea; Shell to store 2mln bbls and BP to store jet fuel for up to 60 days – where participants are taking advantage of the steep contango the term structures are offering. Citi highlights the CapEx and production cuts from US shale companies “is only going to occur more gradually and over the intermediate-term, not soon enough to rebalance the market this year. Elsewhere, having little impact on pricing action, the latest DoE inventory data saw a smaller build than expected in headline crude while production increased to 13.1mln BPD (prev. 13mln BPD), while Tuesday evening’s private inventory data saw an unexpected draw in crude stocks – again, the sudden COVID-19 demand shock and OPEC pricing war remain at the forefront of driving oil prices.</p><h2>BONDS</h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 1 POINT 22 TICKS LOWER AT 134-12.</strong></p><p><strong>The TPLEX continued its bear steepener </strong>amid<strong> </strong>a<strong> </strong>flight to cash seen across all major assets. The offer was most severe in APAC trade as US equity futures hit their limit down. The lift in equities after the US cash open also saw some support for the TPLEX, although ultimately proved short-lived. In the background participants are digesting the mass global fiscal stimulus packages being proposed, which will ramp-up supply. Furthermore, desks note the continued unwind of relative value and basis trades that have been blown up lately, in addition to wider profit-taking in the context of the pronounced drop in rates in the wake of the virus outbreak. By settlement, 2s/10s +7bps to around 63bps, levels not seen since 2018, with the 10-year yield +16bps to 1.16%; note that the 30-year yield reached close to 2% at one point.</p><h2>BREXIT:</h2><p>Under the radar, given COVID, however, negotiators have cancelled the round of talks that were due to take place today. Desks are beginning to talk about an extension to the current transition period, which the government will have to announce by the end of June. UK PM Johnson has previously been vehement that the UK will not be extending the transition, although COVID gives him the political cover to do so. In the UK government press conference on Wednesday, UK PM Johnson, when asked about the Brexit transition period, said we are getting on with it and the legislation is in place.</p><h2>FOREX:</h2><p><strong>The dollar strength continues</strong> with DXY breaching 100 to the upside to highs of 101.75 as demand for cash continues to take precedence over other securities, particularly Gold and T-notes. <strong>The precious metal fell over 3%</strong> today and is back beneath 1500/oz, analysts at BMO Capital highlight the liquidity is “deeply compromised” thus expect to continue to see volatility and “mood-driven swings”. The haven outflows in government bonds have seen the curve bear steepen, likely aiding some of the support for the greenback. Another key driver for DXY strength is the <strong>heavy selling pressure in risk currencies, including GBP</strong> which saw lows at 1.14 before bouncing slightly back above 1.15. HSBC highlights GBP as “doing exactly what it says on the tin”, noting the recent weakness is because it is seen as a risk on currency and given the “risk on risk off” world, it is the reason for the underperformance. The analyst highlights NOK, AUD, GBP and NZD (in that order) as the most risk on currencies which is evident in today’s performance as all those listed have seen heavy weakness, even in that particular order. <strong>EUR fell victim to the stronger buck</strong> albeit less so than the risk on currencies mentioned above. The single currency ignored EZ inflation data which fell in-line with expectations, as data takes a back seat during the current market conditions.&nbsp; <strong>JPY slightly weaker against the buck but firmer against the EUR</strong>, <strong>as is the story for CHF</strong>, where EURCHF remains well within 1.05-1.06. <strong>CAD was hit by the crushing fall in oil</strong> prices once again with USDCAD rising over 5 points from lows at 1.4166 to highs of 1.4651. The CAD 27bln (3% of GDP) stimulus package did little to support the Loonie. Meanwhile, the US and Canada agreed to partially close its borders but noted that trading would go ahead as normal. <strong>The decline in oil prices continues to weigh on the RUB &amp; MXN</strong>, with USDRUB falling over 7% and trades above 80 and USDMXN briefly Crossed the 24-handle before paring slightly; Banxico did announce it would be auctioning another USD 2bln in FX hedges today. The <strong>soured risk appetite has weighed on EMFX in general, with ZAR and BRL both weaker</strong> despite continued FX intervention from the BCB. <strong>TRY also weaker</strong> but not to the same extent as its EMFX counterparts as the currency finds some solace in the lower oil prices.</p>",

Soured risk appetite was the key driver as the coronavirus continues to spread and spook markets as borders begin to shut, airlines continue to cut capacity and company operations begin to halt hurting the demand side even further. Also, Saudi Arabia and Russia appear to show no signs of backing down from its pricing war with Saudi’s Energy Minister directing Aramco to continue to supply crude at 12.3mln BPD over the coming months. Elsewhere, London oil giants Shell (RDS.A LN) and BP (BP LN) are reportedly chartering tankers to store fuel at sea; Shell to store 2mln bbls and BP to store jet fuel for up to 60 days – where participants are taking advantage of the steep contango the term structures are offering. Citi highlights the CapEx and production cuts from US shale companies “is only going to occur more gradually and over the intermediate-term, not soon enough to rebalance the market this year. Elsewhere, having little impact on pricing action, the latest DoE inventory data saw a smaller build than expected in headline crude while production increased to 13.1mln BPD (prev. 13mln BPD), while Tuesday evening’s private inventory data saw an unexpected draw in crude stocks – again, the sudden COVID-19 demand shock and OPEC pricing war remain at the forefront of driving oil prices.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Another rampant day for the <strong>USD </strong>amid further demand as traders and investors convert to cash and stay on the side-lines in light of the continuing market-wide sell-off. <strong>DXY</strong> has topped the key 100 mark (vs. intraday low of 99.150), having topped its previously-set YTD high of 99.915, with traders eyeing 102.20 (March 2017 high) and 103.80 (Jan 2nd 2017 high) as the next potential posts of resistance should the Buck continue to grind higher. Meanwhile, the<strong> Kiwi, Loonie, Aussie, </strong>and<strong> Sterling </strong>remained the weakest G10 links as renewed risk aversion continued to compound funding and liquidity squeezes, whilst Cable also eyes the prospect of a London-wide lockdown with sources flip-flopping on the timing but failing to explicitly deny such measures. <strong>AUD/USD</strong> and <strong>NZD/USD </strong>both lost further ground below 0.6000, with the former hitting a 17yr low of 0.5859 (vs. high 0.6029) and the latter an 11yr base of 0.5806 (vs. high 0.5968) as European players leave for the day. <strong>AUD/NZD</strong> meanwhile drifts closer to parity, with the pair overall flat for the session, having fluctuated in a 1.005-15 intraday band ahead of the RBA’s unscheduled monetary policy announcement at 0330GMT (Full Preview Available on the Research Suite). <strong>GBP/USD</strong> meanwhile plummeted below 1.2000 to an intraday base of 1.1757 at the time of writing, whilst <strong>EUR/GBP</strong> extended its rally beyond 0.9200 to an EU peak of 0.9272 vs. today’s 0.9068 low. <strong>EUR </strong>succumbed to the <strong>Dollar</strong> throughout the session, albeit to a lesser extent, having hardly budged to ECB headlines but more-so lockstep action with the <strong>DXY’s</strong> rise above the key psychological mark. Elsewhere, safe-haven <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> have displayed degrees of resilience against the <strong>USD</strong> strength – <strong>USD/JPY</strong> hesitantly crept higher throughout the session as the pair reclaimed 108.00 to the upside from a sub-107.00 low (106.75). For what it’s worth, technicians may be keeping an eye on the 200 DMA (108.23) and 100 DMA (108.90) for potential mild resistance, although market conditions could prove such levels to be futile. The <strong>Franc</strong> pivoted 0.9700 against the USD heading into the EU close having printed an intraday base at 0.9566, with the SNB policy decision tomorrow’s main event (Full Preview Available on the Research Suite). In terms of Scandi FX, <strong>NOK </strong>was pummelled amid further detrimental losses in the energy complex, <strong>EUR/NOK</strong> surpassed 12.00 and then some to end the EU session at highs of ~12.1240 (vs. low of 11.5000), some 4.5% higher on the day. <strong>SEK </strong>experienced losses alongside, but to a much lesser extent than its Norwegian counterpart given a lower oil revenue dependency. Nonetheless, <strong>EUR/SEK </strong>remained firmly north of 11.000 having printed a high of 11.1950 and a base of 10.8500. Finally, <strong>EM </strong>FX fell prey to the overall risk aversion and the reigning Dollar – <strong>USD/TRY</strong> eyed 6.5000 to the upside following yesterday’s recoil back to sub-6.4000 levels post-CBRT. The <strong>USD/ZAR </strong>topped the 17.000 mark whilst <strong>USD/RUB </strong>tested 80.000 to the upside (vs. intraday low of 74.9000) on energy price-action.</p>",

Boeing (BA) also weighing on the sector significantly and leading losses in the Dow Jones, trading around USD 100/shr amid it’s announcement that it is seeking a minimum of USD 60bln in aid from the government. Energy names continue to reduce CapEx as energy prices continue to fall amid the coronavirus pandemic and with no sign of ease from Russia or Saudi Arabia. The soured risk environment has seen Defensives, Consumer Staples and Health Care, as relative outperformers, albeit still down over 4%. Clorox (CLX) and Gilead (GILD) are among few companies trading in positive territory today given the former sells cleaning supplies, and the latter is aiming to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, while it was also upgraded at DZ Bank. FedEx (FDX) also firmer after earnings which missed on EPS but beat on revenues, while its CEO stated it is ready to meet the increased demand for its international express export services due to the significant fall in intercontinental air capacity. Kroger (KR) and Walmart (WMT) also in the green following upgrades.</li></ul>",

As a result, the index has posted a marginal new 2020 peak at 99.917 and it almost seems inevitable or destined to cross the 100.000 barrier at some stage.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>The weakest G10 links and worst performers vs the Greenback as the funding and liquidity squeeze is compounded by renewed risk aversion, with the Kiwi now down under 0.5900, Loonie approaching 1.4350 and Aussie below 0.5950. Meanwhile, Sterling only gleaned brief support from the UK Government’s whopping additional coronavirus economic support package as Cable relinquished more big figures on the way through the psychological 1.2000 level, while Eur/Gbp has extended its rally beyond 0.9100 to circa 0.9175.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All displaying a degree of resilience and resistance to the general attraction of the Buck, but not impervious by any means with the Yen straddling 107.00, Franc pivoting 0.9600 and still wary of the SNB either sticking to its quarterly policy review timetable or deciding to strike early. On that note, the Euro has already digested the ECB’s latest policy measures and is now taking on board what EZ Governments have (left) to offer while keeping tabs on 1.1000.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>No surprise that the Scandinavian Crowns have fallen prey to the latest bout of risk aversion, while the Nok is also watching the steeper slide in crude prices anxiously along with the Mxn and Rub that has Brent weakness and spread to WTI convergence to contend with. However, some retracement in Eur/Nok after the Norges Bank more than trebled daily FX purchase on behalf of the Government and also noted that more oil revenue will have to be converted for financing anti-COVID-19 initiatives. Elsewhere, the Rand appears vulnerable to a test of 17.0000 ahead of SA retail sales data and post-CPI that was firmer than forecast, but not sufficient to alter consensus for a 50 bp SARB rate cut tomorrow. Sticking with Central Bank easing, not much respite for the Try from cheaper crude costs after the full point intermeeting CBRT move on Tuesday.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat mixed with the region only partially benefitting after the rebound on Wall St from its worst sell-off since 1987, where sentiment was underpinned by efforts to address the coronavirus fallout including reports US plans stimulus of as much as USD 1.2tln consisting of a USD 300bln deferral in IRS payments and sending checks to citizens within 2 weeks, while the Fed also announced it will establish a commercial paper funding facility to support credit flow. ASX 200 (-4.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.5%) are mixed with Australia pressured amid heavy losses in the tech and energy sectors, as well as a retreat in US equity futures after-hours, while the Japanese benchmark is positive following better than expected trade data despite Exports remaining at a contraction for the 15th consecutive month. In terms of the notable stock movers, Fujifilm Holdings hit limit up after reports that China said the Co.’s influenza medicine was effective against coronavirus and are said to plan officially recommending the drug’s use for treatment, while SoftBank shares were at the other side of the spectrum on news it is backing away from part of the planned WeWork bailout. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) also conform to the indecision amid ongoing coronavirus jitters and tentativeness ahead of key earnings from Hong Kong heavyweight Tencent.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly pulled back overnight but holds on to the majority of the gains seen in the prior session where it surged above the 99.00 handle amid favourable rate differentials and fiscal stimulus efforts. Nonetheless, the greenback is off its best levels which has provided some reprieve for its major counterparts including EUR/USD which briefly slipped below the 1.1000 level, while GBP/USD continued its rebound from support at 1.2000 to reclaim the 1.2100 handle after the government announced massive stimulus measures including GBP 330bln of guarantees for business. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retraced some of the prior day’s gains amid the mixed risk sentiment which has also kept antipodeans rangebound due to their high-beta properties, although the AUD/NZD cross briefly tested 1.0100 to the upside after rebounding from near-parity.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued as they tracked the losses seen in T-notes in after hours trade yesterday but with prices off their lows after finding support at 152.00 and with the BoJ in the market for nearly JPY 1.2tln of JGBs heavily concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
