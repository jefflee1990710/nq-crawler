The gains were maintained through the European session, but momentum faded during US hours; equity futures reversed course going into the US open, with activity subdued on the cusp of earnings season, whilst mixed Citi (C) Q2 earnings provided little in the way of positive stimulus. The lacklustre US session saw government debt yields lower and crude markets lower, in part due to the diminished risk appetite, as well as Gulf of Mexico weather related production disturbances not materialising as badly as originally feared.</p><p><strong>* US EMPIRE STATE MANUFACTURING: </strong>US NY Fed Manufacturing data came in at 4.3, beating the expectations of 2.0, and rebounding from the weak June data of -8.6, resulting in the largest monthly gain since June 2017. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that this was always likely due to the poor June figure, which was spurred by a combination of the increase in tariffs on Chinese Imports to 25% from 10%, and the week-long threat of tariffs on Mexican imports. Despite the rebound, Pantheon also notes that it has only half recovered the fall in June. The internals saw a different story to the rising headline number with the 'Fed' metrics eyed figures (prices paid and employment, both falling in July from 27.8 in June to 25.5 for prices paid and from -3.5 to a 42-month low of -9.6 for employment). New orders fell again in July but did rebound slightly to a -1.5 from -12 in June. Other analysts write that firms in the region are expecting figures to recover as the 6-month ahead new orders came in stronger at 35.4 from the 27.8 in June, just shy of the 2019 high of 35.7. The 6-month ahead figure for business conditions also saw an upward print of 30.8 above the prior 25.7.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he expects to have another call with his Chinese counterpart on trade later this week, before adding that there is a \"good chance\" he and USTR Lighthizer could visit China for further talks if progress is made. Separately, US President Trump said if the USMCA deal does not pass congress, then he has a better plan, although the details of this plan remain unclear.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Secretary of State Pompeo approved the granting of a visa to Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif, so he can attend a UN meeting in New York this week, although, Zarif's movements in the US have been severely curtailed, Pompeo added. Meanwhile, Iranian press on the weekend denied that a meeting between Zarif and Pompeo had been arranged, and a foreign ministry official said there were no negotiations going on between Iran and the US at any level. EU’s Foreign Policy Chief Mogherini seemingly presented Iran an olive branch; she said for the time being none of the signatories of the Iran deal have signalled an intention to invoke a dispute mechanism and that none of the parties believe Iran's breaches are significant non-compliance. Moreover, she went on to suggest that shareholders of the Iran Instex mechanism are discussing whether or not to include oil. Iran had earlier said it would stay committed to the nuclear deal providing other signatories stay committed and that they are expecting Europe to take operational steps to fulfil the deal, more specifically in oil. Elsewhere, in a move likely designed to strengthen ties between the two countries, a new Iranian visa waiver for Chinese tourists could be implemented as early as the end of this month; last week it was reported the US is weighing fresh sanctions against China for importing Iranian crude in violation of existing US sanctions.</p><p><strong>* CHINA DATA: </strong>GDP growth in Q2 slowed in line with expectations to 6.2% Q/Q annualised, the slowest pace of growth since quarterly data was first published in 1992. The activity data released (industrial production, retail sales, fixed asset investment); analysts are taking the stabilisation as a sign that the government's fiscal stimulus efforts and the lower yuan have had the effect of partly shielding China's economy amid ongoing trade wars. However, some suggest that this still is not going to dissuade the PBOC from pursuing looser policy in the weeks/months ahead (some think days/weeks, though the consensus thinks the PBOC will await the outcome of July's Fed and ECB meetings first).</p><p><strong>* US COMMERCE SECRETARY ROSS: </strong>US President Trump is reportedly considering removing US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after a stinging Supreme Court defeat on adding a citizenship question to the census. Some White House officials now expect Ross to be the next Cabinet secretary to depart, possibly as soon as this summer.</p><p><strong>* RBA MINS PREVIEW: </strong>In July, the RBA delivered a second consecutive rate cut of 25bps, taking its Cash Rate to 1.00%, and the minutes to the meeting are likely to give provide insight as to whether it is a 'two and done' as the central bank passes the baton of responsibility over to the fiscal authorities (recent tax changes could be the equivalent of a 50bps rate cut, analysts have suggested, easing the pressure on the RBA to cut rates further), or whether more easing remains on the cards. Some have warned that the minutes may strike a more dovish tone than the post-meeting statement, which contained little forward guidance. As other major central banks have, the RBA will likely caution on increasing global risks, soft inflation, and widening slack in the labour market. \"Markets will likely continue to price in the risk of further easing, although we expect the RBA to sit on its hands in the coming months to assess the impact of 50bps of easing, near-term fiscal stimulus and recent APRA change to serviceability,\" RBC writes.</p><p><strong>* HUAWEI: </strong>The Chinese tech giant is reportedly planning extensive layoffs in the US, as it continues to grapple with its US blacklisting; the WSJ reported that the layoffs are expected to impact Huawei subsidiary, Futurewei Technologies.</p><p><strong>* JAPAN/SOUTH KOREA: </strong>The WTO has stepped into the latest escalation of trade tensions between South Korea and Japan, agreeing to formally discuss Seoul's grievances over Tokyo's restrictions against exports of semiconductor materials later this month, Nikkei reported. South Korea is likely to demand that Japan either fully justify the export curbs or withdraw them completely when the WTO's General Council convenes July 23rd/24th. Japan will likely respond by reiterating that the trade strictures are based on legitimate security concerns, Nikkei said, adding that the exchange is not expected to make much progress, and will more likely serve as a \"venue for recruiting sympathizers\" in the international arena, a diplomatic source said.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Anti-Brexit campaign Gina Miller has threatened to sue any future government that prorogues parliament in an effort to engineer a hard exit from the EU.</p><p><strong>* EUROPEAN TOP JOBS: </strong>Ahead of a vote this week, it appears Ursula Von Der Leyen has secured enough support to win a majority; Bloomberg News reported that over half of socialist MEPs will vote for her, and along with support from the centre-right MEPs, this should be enough for her to win the job to lead the European Commission. Von Der Leyen later commented that she wants full flexibility of EU fiscal rules and urging for a more growth friendly stance on fiscal policy, which could be a positive inclination for - fiscally constrained - Italy.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 127-05+.</strong> The T-plex saw some downward pressure following mixed Chinese data overnight however losses were pared back throughout the rest of the session, volume on Monday was weak ahead of key data points such as US retail sales on Tuesday and a slew of fed speak later in the week as we head towards the blackout period. Analysts noted some large block buys providing momentum, with 8.3k in TUU9 at 107.113 and 14.4k in TYU9 at 127’01. At settlement the curve had flattened, with the 30-year yield down by c. 2.5bps, and the 2s/30s contracted by just over 2bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLE USD 0.63 LOWER AT USD 59.58/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.24 LOWER AT USD 66.48/BBL: </strong>Crude futures had been drifting higher in the early session before reversing course into the US equity open amid fresh weather disruptions becoming a new factor in the market. “Tropical Depression” Barry continued to cause supply disruptions over the weekend in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil production had been curtailed by up to 73% over the weekend (69% according to the latest update); price gains have been limited with producers reportedly returning workforce personnel to platforms after Barry proved to be less damaging than previously expected. Citigroup’s energy analysts note that the impact has been limited on inland Louisiana refiners, which has seen downside in US product prices that is likely to be weighing on the major crude benchmarks; the bank’s running total has 5.4mln bbls of crude production lost through Sunday, “and still counting”. Participants have also been digesting China’s Q2 GDP growth, which continued to show a decelerating economy in the headline figure (6.2% YY), but June industrial production and retail sales did top estimates. The China demand concerns were somewhat overshadowed by its June crude throughput figures, which showed a rise of 7.7% YY to a record 13.07mln BPD, no-doubt assisted by the launch of two new 400k BPD refineries in May; Citi noted these figures fit with the narrative of stronger crude oil and the weakness in products. Looking ahead, the latest US energy inventory expectations see crude stocks drawing 3.4mln bbls, distillates building 0.4mln, and gasoline drawing 1.9mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0% AT 3014, NASDAQ-100 0.3% AT 7967, DOW JONES 0.1% AT 27359, S&amp;P500 Sectors</strong>: Consumer Discretionary 0.3%, Consumer Staples 0.2%, Energy -0.9%, Financials -0.5%,Health Care 0.2%, Industrials -0.4%, Information Technology 0.3%, Materials 0.2%, Telecommunication Services 0.1%, Utilities 0.4%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Citi kicked-off Q2 earnings seasons for financials with a solid beat on both top and bottom lines; Citi (and bank shares more broadly) initially jumped higher. However, as the market digested Citi’s NIM reading, which came in below expectations, gains were quickly reversed, and financials ended up an underperforming sector on the day, although Citigroup share price.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing (BA) shares moved lower on a WSJ report which suggested that the 737 MAX grounding could last into 2020. American Airlines (AAL) was under pressure after it extended flight cancellations related to the grounding into November, the fourth time the co. has extended such cancelations. Facebook (FB) also struggled, after reports the tech giant is close to reaching a settlement with the FTC, in which the co. would pay a USD 5bln fine. Gilead Sciences (GILD) shares opened higher on the news that the Biotech firm is to is to invest USD 5.1bln in Galapagos (GLPG), increasing its ownership stake in the co. to 22% from 12.3%, whilst also partnering with the Belgian-Dutch biotech firm to develop treatments over a ten-year period. Broadcom (AVGO) shares rose and Symantec’s (SYMC) fell after merger talks collapsed premarket. Callon Petroleum Co. (CPE) shares sunk on the news that the co. is to acquire Carrizo Oil &amp; Gas (CRZO), whose share price shot higher. Amazon (AMZN) ticked higher as Prime Day kicked off, though there have been reports that its website is facing tech issues again. Nielsen Holdings (NLSN) was higher on vague takeover rumours that KKR (KKR) would potentially make a bid for the co. Notable stocks benefiting from positive upgrades; Hillenbrand (HI) upgraded at DA Davidson, Crocs (CROX) upgraded at Piper Jaffray. Notable stocks under pressure after negative broker moves; Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) downgraded at Morgan Stanley, Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF) downgraded at Citi, Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP), International Paper (IP) downgraded at Keybanc, Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) downgraded at Credit Suisse, Marriot International (MAR) downgraded at Longbow.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Havens <strong>CHF</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong> were sold overnight, as activity data from China generally printed in line/slight beat vs expectations, helping to support risk, although Japanese players were away for a market holiday (108.50 is still the key resistance). Ahead of jobs data on Tuesday, <strong>GBP</strong> is lower, flirting with 1.25 again. The <strong>EUR</strong> was modestly weaker, while <strong>USD</strong> was modestly firmer; with some desks on the lookout for ECB sources stories this week to shape expectations ahead of the July meeting. Although the single currency is modestly lower on the day, desks have reasoned that a dovish Fed, Trump's weak USD preference, and optimism about global growth (in wake of better than expected Chinese data) should all provide support. <strong>CAD</strong> was initially firmer, benefitting from firmer risk sentiment and the BOC's neutral bias, which makes CAD attractive against USD (where the Fed is priced to cut rates this month), although finished the session marginally weaker vs the buck. <strong>Antipodeans</strong>, often seen as a proxy for Chinese growth, rallied on promising Chinese data (retail sales, industrial production and urban investment all beating expectations). <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally firmer on the day; <strong>ZAR</strong> consolidated around 13.90; despite former SA President Zuma appearing in court for a corruption enquiry and Eskom’s Treasurer resigning, and ahead of a potential SARB rate cut on Thursday. <strong>TRY</strong> held between 5.70-5.72 in spite of another Turkish sovereign ratings cut (at Fitch) and dovish sounding talk from the new CBRT head, with investors taking the postponement of last Friday’s US statement as a sign that any sanctions due to the Russian S-400 missile order may be less harsh than originally feared. <strong>BRL</strong> gradually weakened back to 3.7500, amidst reports that the Lower House of Congress may delay its Pension Reform Bill vote until after the Summer recess due to amendments that could cut the amount of savings from the overhaul.</p>",

Citigroup’s energy analysts note that the impact has been limited on inland Louisiana refiners, which has seen downside in US product prices that is likely to be weighing on the major crude benchmarks; the bank’s running total has 5.4mln bbls of crude production lost through Sunday, “and still counting”. Participants have also been digesting China’s Q2 GDP growth, which continued to show a decelerating economy in the headline figure (6.2% YY), but June industrial production and retail sales did top estimates. The China demand concerns were somewhat overshadowed by its June crude throughput figures, which showed a rise of 7.7% YY to a record 13.07mln BPD, no-doubt assisted by the launch of two new 400k BPD refineries in May; Citi noted these figures fit with the narrative of stronger crude oil and the weakness in products. Looking ahead, the latest US energy inventory expectations see crude stocks drawing 3.4mln bbls, distillates building 0.4mln, and gasoline drawing 1.9mln bbls.</p>",

Nzd/Usd is consolidating comfortably above the 0.6700 handle, while Cable has slipped further from best levels back towards 1.2500 and only just held above Friday’s 1.2522 low as the Gbp/Nzd cross drops from just over 1.8800 to 1.8623 at one stage. Note, data could well provide the next major drivers for both currencies, with NZ Q2 CPI out later tonight and then UK labour and earnings scheduled on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong></p><p>The next best major and partly on a continuation of recalibrating and realigning positions to fit with the flip-flop in RBA vs Fed policy guidance/outlooks. However, Aud/Usd is also afloat within a 0.7038-09 range in wake of overnight Chinese macro releases showing ip and retail sales beats vs in line and multi-year slow GDP growth.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>Still hugging tight lines vs the Usd as the <strong>DXY </strong>itself meanders in a narrow band just under the psychological 97.000 level, with the Yen tethered to 108.00 and awaiting the return of Japanese participants from their long holiday weekend (Marine Day). Meanwhile, soft Swiss producer and import prices have not hampered the Franc as Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf meander between 0.9818-54 and 1.1102-1.1067 respectively in contrast to the Loonie that lost some impetus following sub-forecast Canadian existing home sales, with Usd/Cad nearer the top of a 1.3042-21 band. The single currency stalled ahead of 1.1300 and major technical resistance above the big figure, and Eur/Usd is now testing chart support at 1.1262 (21 DMA).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some contrasting and perhaps surprising performances across the region, as Usd/Try held around 5.7323-6978 in spite of another Turkish sovereign ratings cut and dovish sounding talk from new CBRT head with investors taking the postponement of last Friday’s US statement as a sign that any sanctions due to the Russian S-400 missile order may be less harsh than originally feared. Similarly, Usd/Zar reversed sharply from circa 13.9875 to 13.8590 even though former SA President Zuma appeared in court for a corruption enquiry and Eskom’s Treasurer resigned, but Usd/Brl gradually rallied from 3.7285 to 3.7531 amidst reports that the Lower House of Congress may delay its Pension Reform Bill vote until after the Summer recess due to amendments that could cut the amount of savings from the overhaul.</p>",

Meanwhile, movers include the likes of Antofagasta (+4.0%) after the Co’s JV with Barrick Gold was awarded USD 5.84bln in damages from a legal dispute with the Pakistani government. Elsewhere, AB InBev (-2.0%) shares declined after the Co. back-tracked on its Hong Kong IPO plans due to little demand from long-term investors, the IPO was meant aid the Co. with its USD 100bln debt pile. Airbus (+0.6%) shares rose in early trade amid a weekend WSJ article which highlighted Boeing’s 737 Max is likely to be grounded until January next year as the jet is yet to satisfy all safety requirements, according to union leaders and officials. Finally, analysts at JPM have raised their 12-month S&amp;P 500 price target to 3200 (Prev. 3000) citing factors including synchronised easing of global central banks, attractive relative valuation, intracycle profit recovering by year-end and a record share buyback to buoy equity demand; for reference, the S&amp;P closed at a record 3013 on Friday. The analysts also expect a partial US-Sino trade deal heading into the US election year, although this has been caveated as their largest single downside risk to the view.</p><p><strong>Citigroup (C) –</strong> are due to report earnings at 13:00 BST today, in terms of focus some are highlighting that management guidance around NII is key, rather than the headline prints (EPS Exp.

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD -</strong> The Antipodean Dollars continue to outperform, and the latest advances have been made with the aid of better than expected Chinese data in the form of ip and retail sales. However, with GDP in line with consensus and slowing to a 27 year low, it is the Kiwi rather than Aussie that has really extended gains from last week to a 0.6725 high vs its US counterpart and towards 1.0450 in cross terms as Aud/Usd stalls at 0.7035. Note also, Westpac sees more upside for Nzd/Usd in the short term based on the Fed’s dovish tilt, but then a reversal through 0.6600 next month assuming the RBNZ eases again. More immediately, NZ inflation for Q2 looms and the forecast is for firmer CPI prints.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/CAD -</strong> All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but with the Franc also getting a bullish nod via a bank trade recommendation as MS favours going short of Usd/Chf at current levels circa 0.9835 for 0.9730 with a 0.9980 stop, while Eur/Chf hovers closer to the base of a 1.1100-1.1085 range and shrugs off weak Swiss producer/import prices. Meanwhile, the single currency remains trapped in a tight range inside 1.1250-1.1300 vs the Buck and flanked by key chart support and resistance, like the 100 DMA at 1.1255, a 50% Fib at 1.1303 and the 200 DMA at 1.1323. Elsewhere, the Yen is pivoting 108.00 in an equally tight range and with trade/interest hampered by Japan’s Marine Day market holiday, but the Loonie is consolidating recent gains between 1.3042-22 after last Wednesday’s relatively hawkish or neutral BoC hold.</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> In stark contrast to yesterday’s Lords result, the Pound is lagging behind G10 peers, and especially the Kiwi. Cable is only just holding 1.2550 after another fade ahead of 1.2600 even though the Dollar is generally soft and the DXY is depressed below 97.000, with the ongoing UK political void weighing on sentiment and Brexit still up in the air as a result.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Lira is holding up quite well in the face of another Turkish ratings downgrade (1 peg by Fitch to BB-, outlook negative) with Usd/Try meandering between 5.7070-7325 vs a peak of 5.7800 late last Friday when a White House statement about Turkey’s S-400 missile system purchase from Russia was unexpectedly shelved amidst speculation that US President Trump may err on the side of lenience when it comes to any sanctions. Conversely, the Real may come under pressure and Usd/Brl rally from 3.7400 on the back of reports Brazil’s lower house could delay a vote on pension reforms until August (ie after this Friday’s recess) due to proposed amendments that could diminish the financial savings from the new package.</p><p>Turkish President Erdogan reportedly said that Turkey will make serious cuts to interest rates, according to Haberturk.

Market contacts point out that this represented a Fib retracement and the inference is that tech traders/jobbers may have been behind the subsequent rebound, with stops perhaps tripped when near term resistance was breached around 171.79. However, a downturn in EU stocks could be another factor while the sheer scale and speed of the fall in debt/back-up in yields is likely to have contributed or at least added impetus. However, the <strong>core German bond</strong> faces another chart hurdle around 172.12 and <strong>Gilts</strong> at 130.89 vs 172.06 and 130.72 at best thus far, while <strong>USTs</strong> remain below par and the back end is still underperforming ahead of the first of the big bank earnings, Empire State manufacturing and Fed’s Williams.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Little to report on the energy front, although WTI and Brent futures remain choppy within a relatively narrow intraday band thus far.

Elsewhere, Hurricane Barry has abated to a tropical depression, with eyes now on any refineries coming back online after the Gulf’s crude output was cut by 70% on Friday amid storm preparations. ING notes that output in the Gulf is likely to return to normal levels over the coming days. Meanwhile, gold prices are little changed amid a steady USD and base metals were bolstered by the mostly upbeat Chinese data overnight. As such copper has reclaimed 2.7/lb to the upside while nickel surged in excess of 3.0% deriving additional strength from supply woes.</p><p>BSEE said Gulf of Mexico crude output was cut by 70% on Friday and natural gas output was reduced by 56% due to storm preparations, while the NHC stated on Sunday that Barry weakened to a tropical depression over north-western Louisiana and that life-threatening flooding rains will continue into Monday.

        "content": "<p>Bunds and Eurozone peers continue to lead the recovery from recent lows, and the former reclaimed 172.00 before losing momentum having bounced further from the 171.49 overnight Eurex low. Market contacts point out that this represented a Fib retracement and the inference is that tech traders/jobbers may have been behind the subsequent rebound, with stops perhaps tripped when near term resistance was breached around 171.79. However, a downturn in EU stocks could be another factor while the sheer scale and speed of the fall in debt/back-up in yields is likely to have contributed or at least added impetus. However, the core German bond faces another chart hurdle around 172.12 and Gilts at 130.89 vs 172.06 and 130.72 at best thus far, while USTs remain below par and the back end is still underperforming ahead of the first of the big bank earnings, Empire State manufacturing and Fed’s Williams.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars continue to outperform, and the latest advances have been made with the aid of better than expected Chinese data in the form of ip and retail sales. However, with GDP in line with consensus and slowing to a 27 year low, it is the Kiwi rather than Aussie that has really extended gains from last week to a 0.6725 high vs its US counterpart and towards 1.0450 in cross terms as Aud/Usd stalls at 0.7035. Note also, Westpac sees more upside for Nzd/Usd in the short term based on the Fed’s dovish tilt, but then a reversal through 0.6600 next month assuming the RBNZ eases again. More immediately, NZ inflation for Q2 looms and the forecast is for firmer CPI prints.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but with the Franc also getting a bullish nod via a bank trade recommendation as MS favours going short of Usd/Chf at current levels circa 0.9835 for 0.9730 with a 0.9980 stop, while Eur/Chf hovers closer to the base of a 1.1100-1.1085 range and shrugs off weak Swiss producer/import prices. Meanwhile, the single currency remains trapped in a tight range inside 1.1250-1.1300 vs the Buck and flanked by key chart support and resistance, like the 100 DMA at 1.1255, a 50% Fib at 1.1303 and the 200 DMA at 1.1323. Elsewhere, the Yen is pivoting 108.00 in an equally tight range and with trade/interest hampered by Japan’s Marine Day market holiday, but the Loonie is consolidating recent gains between 1.3042-22 after last Wednesday’s relatively hawkish or neutral BoC hold.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to yesterday’s Lords result, the Pound is lagging behind G10 peers, and especially the Kiwi. Cable is only just holding 1.2550 after another fade ahead of 1.2600 even though the Dollar is generally soft and the <strong>DXY </strong>is depressed below 97.000, with the ongoing UK political void weighing on sentiment and Brexit still up in the air as a result.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira is holding up quite well in the face of another Turkish ratings downgrade (1 peg by Fitch to BB-, outlook negative) with Usd/Try meandering between 5.7070-7325 vs a peak of 5.7800 late last Friday when a White House statement about Turkey’s S-400 missile system purchase from Russia was unexpectedly shelved amidst speculation that US President Trump may err on the side of lenience when it comes to any sanctions. Conversely, the Real may come under pressure and Usd/Brl rally from 3.7400 on the back of reports Brazil’s lower house could delay a vote on pension reforms until August (ie after this Friday’s recess) due to proposed amendments that could diminish the financial savings from the new package.</p>",

However, trade is tentative and the overall tone not very convincing as debt markets continue to ‘correct’ or reverse from early July record highs and eye a firmer tone in EU equities in wake of several stronger than expected Chinese data points overnight. Back to Liffe, Short Sterling contracts are flitting either side of par within -1/+1 tick confines ahead of a run of primary domestic releases kicking off from Tuesday with jobs and earnings, followed by 2037 DMO supply and a speech from BoE Governor Carney.</p>",

Indeed, some further consolidation and 2-way trade would not be surprising given the fact that yields have rebounded significantly and the ECB is expected to turn more dovish again next week. Moreover, -25 bp may well prove as sticky on the upside as the -40 bp level did on the way down, especially if the depo rate is shaved again in due course.</p>",
