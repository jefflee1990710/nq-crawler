Chinese offcials are signalling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal, according to reports citing sources. Meanwhile. US President Trump says we have a very good chance of making a deal with China. (Newswires)</p><p>Hong Kong court declined an injunction to suspend the anti-mask law. Separately, Hong Kong police fired tear gas at protesters after government enacts new emergency laws and a second teenager has been shot in the leg by police and is in a serious condition, according to Sky News citing sources. It is not clear if the teenager was shot by a rubber bullet or a live round. (Newswires)</p><p>China Foreign Reserves (Sep) 3.092tln vs. Exp. 3.105tln – first decline in four months. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRADE</strong></p><p>EU regulators have opened a probe into Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) deal, citing competition concerns; will decide by February 2020. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell </strong>repeated economy is in a good place despite some risks; inflation running close to, but below Fed's 2% target. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Mester (Non-voter, Hawk)</strong> said she is data-dependent and the US economy doing pretty well, jobs report was good; Fed knew economy would slow this year; headwinds on trade must be taken seriously. (CNBC)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Rosengren (Voter, Dissenter, Hawk)</strong> said we have to keep in mind where we are in the cycle, we have low unemployment and inflation is near the 2% target, so a pace of jobs between 90-150k a month is normal for a healthy economy. Rosengren added that the overall US economic growth will be around 1.7% for Q3/Q4 in 2019 and the data in recent weeks is not a complete surprise, tariffs effecting both manufacturing and exports. Further, he said indicators for consumer spending remain strong and monetary policy is currently accommodative. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bostic (Non-voter, Dove)</strong> said stimulus is intended to address weaknesses and assist the economy through difficulties; and added that Fed is trying to determine if the economy is heading towards a soft or hard landing. (Newswires)</p><p>US NEC Director Kudlow says the economy is at a turning point; notes that manufacturing weakness stems from Germany. (Newswirs)</p><p>Key documents related to Ukraine are sought from US VP Pence by House committees.
