        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities up, dollar down, Treasuries down, crude down.<br />* REAR VIEW: Trump extends China deadline; Trump targets OPEC again; UK Labour to back People&rsquo;s Vote.<br />* AHEAD: German GfK Consumer Sentiment, US Building Permits &amp; Housing Starts, US Consumer Confidence, Fed Discount Rate Minutes, BoE&rsquo;s Carney, Ramsden, Vlieghe &amp; Haskel Testifying, Fed&rsquo;s Powell testifying before the Senate, German, UK and US Auctions, Earnings from: Macy&rsquo;s, Home Depot, Thales, BASF, Persimmon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Following the bomb-shell overnight, that US President Trump would extend the hard deadline to reach a trade deal with China, or face additional tariffs, new news was thin through US trade. Again, Trump threw around the idea of a meeting with China President Xi towards the end of March to sign off on the deal, although gave his characteristic caveats (&lsquo;deal may or may not happen&rsquo; type comments). If anything, it was interesting to note some of the comments that pushed back on the positivity: Although we heard that progress had been made on key areas such as IP, technology transfers and structural issues, it was reported in the Chinese state-backed magazine Xinhua that there has not been agreement on the enforcement of a currency pact which would ensure China will not manipulate the Yuan. Trump also gave ambiguous remarks again today saying that he will &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; get a deal done, an echoing some of the flip-flopping seen on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK&rsquo;s Opposition Labour Party announced on Monday that the party will be prepared to back a second referendum provided that their proposed Brexit deal is rejected on Wednesday in parliament. However, it was reported that around 70 Labour MPs would vote against a second referendum, with some reporters highlighting that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has not warmed to a second referendum previously and this could be a political move to gain plaudits and not something that he would have to actually go through with. Late in the session, it was reported that UK PM May weighing plan to win Remain ministers, says if she fails to get deal by 12 March she will offer vote on no deal, if defeated she will offer vote on A50 extension, though this still may not be enough to win Remainers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PRIMER: FED CHAIR POWELL TO TESTIFY TO SENATE AT 1500 GMT/1000 EASTERN ON 26 FEB 2019 </strong>(text released at 1445 GMT/0945 Eastern). Fed Chair Powell will deliver his semi-annual testimony to US lawmakers (Senate Banking Panel on 26 Feb, House Financial Service Committee on 27 Feb). The market will be attentive to commentary around balance sheet normalisation, and the Fed&#39;s patient approach to lifting rates. Powell has typically avoided rocking the boat at these sorts of events, and as such, we expect he will echo the key messages of the recent Fed meeting minutes, which were net/net neutral. The minutes suggested that there is a consensus view on the FOMC that the balance sheet run-off will conclude this year. Crucially, although US surprise indices and GDP trackers have been heading south, the FOMC still does not foresee any rate cuts this year; on the contrary, the message seems to be that if the economy evolves in line with the Fed&#39;s projections (made in December, and to be updated at its next policy meeting in March), then rate hikes may still be on the agenda. Therefore, Powell will likely reiterate the data-dependent stance of the central bank. Given his testimony will be in a political arena, the Fed chair will almost inevitably face questions about the independence of the central bank (which he will likely defend again). A UBS fixed income sales trader said &quot;There have been plenty of Fed speakers in the last few days, so Powell is unlikely to provide much new information. However, the market will be looking for further clues about any possible changes to how the Fed deals with inflation given recent comments from NY Fed President Williams as well as Vice Chair Clarida.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Clarida (voter, neutral) said labour participation rates have been increasing recently. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dovish) said the Fed has let the economy run a little hotter to help boost labour markets and that low inflation gives the Fed the luxury of trying to get more people working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) settles USD 1.78 lower at USD 55.48/bbl; Brent (J9) settles USD 2.36 lower at USD 64.76/bbl. </strong>Oil prices dropped off today as US President Trump tweeted his distaste for rising prices, despite earlier news which spurred risk appetite after the recent breakthrough in Sino-US trade relations. Crude was gaining momentum going into the US equity open &ndash; running in tandem with bullish equity sentiment being spurred by the US-China tariff March 1st date being delayed &ndash; but suddenly reversed course from other key risk assets as Trump took to twitter to declare: &ldquo;oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!&rdquo; This outburst saw a big leg down in both WTI and Brent, where the complex continued to drift lower throughout the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2796, NDX +0.4% at 7115, DJI +0.2% at 26092. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.2%, Materials +0.7%, Industrials +0.4%, Cons Discretionary -0.3%, Cons Staples -0.5%, Healthcare +0.1%, Financials +0.4%, Tech +0.5%, Telecoms +0.1%, Utilities -0.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>General Electric (GE) and Danaher (DHR) both surged on Monday after Danaher agreed to purchase GE&rsquo;s Life Sciences unit for USD 21.4bln in cash. Newmont Mining (NEM) opened lower whilst Barrick Gold (GOLD) made its all-stock merger proposal for it. Warren Buffet&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) reported a net loss in Q4, as well as a sizeable loss from its equity interest in Kraft-Heinz (KHC). Cisco (CSCO) outperformed as it announced a range of new products at the MWC conference in Barcelona. The trade sensitive semiconductors (WDC, AMD, INTC) caught a bid following the March 1st US/China trade tariff deadline being extended; industrials Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) gained also. Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) more than doubled in market value after Roche (ROG SW) agreed to acquire it for over USD 4.8bln. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) benefitted from an upgrade at Macquarie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 3+ LOWER TICKS AT 122-01. </strong>The complex found sellers as risk sentiment improved. Ahead of month-end, analysts reminded that the Treasury extension is quite chunky at 0.12yrs. The US sold 2 and 5-year paper on Monday, ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 5s (the auctions coming a earlier to allow for month-end settlement. The 2-year auction was reasonable, stopping through 0.1bps, despite slightly softer cover. Indirect bidders, however, dropped significantly, with takedown at 38.6% vs 53.4% previously. The 5s auction stopped through 0.2bps, with cover coming in line with the priors. The curve bias was towards steepening in major spreads, though the extent was modest (under 1bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD, JPY, CHF: USD </strong>was slightly lower on improve risk sentiment. JPY has seen modest outflows on news US President Trump has extended the deadline for additional tariffs, citing progress in talks with China. While JPY was more broadly up, CHF was not; analysts at SocGen argued that there is still a good case to be made for building shorts in USD position through USDCHF: &quot;EURCHF will only go up in the context of a stronger euro across the board, and short USDCHF is a cleaner expression of a bearish dollar view.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Narrowing bund/BTP differentials have lifted the EUR after Italy escaped a downgrade at Fitch on Friday. &quot;It has been trading in a tight range last few days and with positioning still rather bearish I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it eventually squeezed through the 1.1370/80 resistance area,&quot; UBS said. That area was not really tested through Monday trade, and analysts have noted; the quarterly range for EURUSD in Q1 is roughly 3.36 figures, putting it on course to beat Q4 2018&#39;s 4.12 figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>As a proxy for China, both saw upside in Monday trade, though the 0.72 level remains ellusive for the Aussie, while the Kiwi was up in sympathy as well as supported by decent NZ data overnight. CAD was unable to benefit from the better risk sentiment on Monday, largely weighed on by falling oil prices (Trump tweets). However, USDCAD has been unable to breach 1.32; other commodity-FX was also under pressure, like the NOK, which was firm early doors (with the pro-cyclical SEK), though the NOK gave back gains on falling oil prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling eventually breached 1.31 to the upside after noise that UK Labour (the opposition) would support a second referendum in the UK should the Brexit deal be rejected this week, although follow up comments seemed to cast doubt on the latter part. The exact form of th amendment and timing were not clear, a spokesperson said. With some analysts continuing to push buy the dip calls on GBP, it is worth being aware of the 200DMA slightly below 1.30, followed by 1.3050-60; on the upside, 1.3090-1.3110 is the level to watch, technicians said.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Antipodean Dollars have extended gains and outperformance vs major counterparts even though US President Trump has poured cold water or tempered expectations that a trade deal with China is on the way after latest talks were deemed progressive from both sides, and enough for him to shelve Friday&rsquo;s import tariff hikes. However, in latest tweets he remained guarded and still uncertain whether a deal will be struck, albeit adding that if an accord is reached then there will be an official signing ceremony to mark the occasion. Nevertheless, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are only just off best levels circa 0.7184 and 0.6900 respectively, with the former inching closer to last week&rsquo;s 0.7200+ peak and latter still getting independent momentum from a significant NZ Q4 retail sales beat and now awaiting a speech from RNBZ&rsquo;s Bascand who suggested last week that higher bank capital requirements will raise the prospects an OCR cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/SEK &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All vying for 3rd place in the major rankings as the broad Dollar and DXY slip back from modest recovery highs (index closer to the base of a 96.314-510 range). The single currency has staged another concerted attempt to breach tech resistance at the 30 DMA (1.1365) and Cable is sitting comfortably between 1.3042-98 parameters against the backdrop of latest Brexit talks between UK PM May and EU officials/leaders and heightened speculation that an extension may be inevitable the longer that the clocks ticks down to March 29 without a withdrawal deal. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona remains bid and on the rebound post-relatively hawkish Riksbank minutes last week, with Eur/Sek below 10.6000, but off lows as the NOK feels the heat of retreating oil prices after US President Trump&rsquo;s latest verbal intervention (crude getting too dear again, OPEC needs to relax) alongside the CAD and RUB to a lesser degree. Note, Eur/Nok is up near the top of a 9.7663-7345 band, Usd/Cad has now cleared its 200 DMA at 1.3155 and extended to 1.3173 and Usd/Rub is back to flat circa 65.3250 vs a low of 65.1670 compared to other EMs that are still holding decent risk-on gains, like Usd/Zar testing sub-13.8200 levels and Usd/Cnh below 6.6800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Predictably, the traditional safe-haven currencies are losing out due to the aforementioned bullish start to the new week for risk assets with Usd/Jpy inching back up towards overnight highs of 110.85 vs circa 110.60 earlier in Monday&rsquo;s EU session and Usd/Chf around parity vs 0.9984 at the trough.</p>\r\n",

UBS notes around USD 98bln of cash flows, excluding the SOMA holdings, and include some USD 82bln of redemptions that fall due this week. With USD 113bln of Treasury supply this week, net supply is implied at USD 31.4bln. For the month-end Fed holdings, USD 12.5bln matures, with the Fed due to add USD 2.1bln to 2s, USD 2.1bln for 5s, and USD 1.7bln to 7s.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>RECENT AUCTIONS: </strong>TD Securities points out that auctions have performed well of late, with central banks&#39; pivoting dovish. &quot;Allotment data shows that recent fund takedowns at auctions have rebounded and foreign allotments have risen from the lows, hinting at stronger demand for auctions from both investment funds and foreign buyers,&quot; TD writes, &quot;we generally expect the coming week&#39;s auction series to go relatively well, particularly given our expectation for no further coupon auction size increases by Treasury for the remainder of 2019.&quot;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>2-year preview (1130 Eastern):&nbsp;</strong>The January 2s auction was decent with encouraging cover and dealer takedown (with the latter considerably below its 2018 average), with investment funds taking its highest allocation on record, despite foreign participation slipping. Barclays analysts note that three of the last four auctions have stoped through (December was the exception). While recent averages point to a small tail, TD expects the auction to come in on the screws and expect a 60% buy side takedown (47% to indirects and 13% to directs).</li>\r\n  <li><strong>5-year preview (1300 Eastern):</strong>&nbsp;January&#39;s 5-year auction was also solid, stopping through 0.8bps, again with investment fund takedown notable. &quot;While the richness of 5s on the fly could keep some investors away, contained rate hike and inflation expectations are likely to keep demand elevated,&quot; TD says, &quot;we look for a modest 0.2bp tail and 69% buy side take (60% to indirects and 9% to directs).&quot; Nomura has suggested that a possible headwind for the auctions may be a supply congestion, given that both the 2s and 5s are on the slate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

(The Guardian) Brexit is to be delayed for up to two months under plans being considered by UK PM May in a bid to avoid resignations by ministers; according to The Telegraph.

(The Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior UK Ministers Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke said they will vote for a Brexit delay if there is no breakthrough in negotiations. Five cabinet ministers have called on Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd to be sacked after she threatened to vote for the delay.

Sectors are mixed, with some slight outperformance in Financial names. Other notable movers include PostNL (+9.9%) who are at the top of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings. UK housebuilders are underperforming after Persimmon (-4.4%) are reportedly facing removal of their right to participate in the government&rsquo;s Help to Buy scheme, following reports of poor standards and hidden charges; as such, Taylor Wimpey (-2.5%) and Barratt Developments (-1.5%) are down in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/SEK/NOK The Aussie and Kiwi are just eclipsing the Swedish Crown at the helm of the G10 pack, partly on latest US-China trade news that has lifted broad risk sentiment, and for the Nzd also much stronger than expected data in the form of Q4 retail sales overnight. Aud/Usd has rebounded further from recent sub-0.7100 lows through the 50 DMA (0.7134) and just above&nbsp; the 0.7161 (100 DMA) to a high of 0.7174 with last Thursday&rsquo;s high (0.7207) next on the rader for bulls. Nzd/Usd is hovering just below the top of a 0.6883-27 range as the cross pivots 1.0400 again. Similarly, the Sek and Nok are benefiting from the general appetite for risk assets, with Eur/Sek extending its post-Riksbank minutes retreat to just under 10.5600 at best, while Eur/Nok has been down through 9.7400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR&nbsp; The next best majors, but mainly at the expense of a softer Usd with the DXY slipping back below 96.500 on the aforementioned US-Sino tariff truce, as Cable maintains 1.3000+ status and the single currency keeps its head above 1.1300. However, the Pound has been choppy again amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a barrage of contrasting headlines, and the Eur is still encountering chart hurdles above 1.1350, like the 30 DMA around 1.1365.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/JPY All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but the Loonie is consolidating closer to highs vs its US counterpart alongside crude prices and eyeing 1.3100 within a 1.3150-22 range and the Franc appears more settled above parity, while the Jpy has pared some overnight losses from 110.85 towards 110.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM Understandably, the Yuans have greeted &lsquo;substantial&rsquo; or &lsquo;concrete&rsquo; progress between the US and China on the trade issue with delight/huge relief, and from another softer PBoC Usd/Cny reference point have rallied further to test 6.6900+ levels. However, other regional currencies are also getting a boost on the prospect of a deal and wider repercussions for the global economy, with Usd/Zar down sharply from 13.9930 to 13.8480 at one stage, Usd/Rub under 65.2500 and Eur/Huf probing below 318.00 (Forint also appreciating Fitch&rsquo;s Hungarian upgrade to BBB/stable outlook).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both extended losses to set marginal new Eurex and Liffe intraday lows at 166.20 and 123.96 respectively, but while the former breached near term chart support around 166.27-25 in the process it did not really threaten last Friday&rsquo;s 166.11 session base or 166.00 obviously. Hence, another consolidative bounce and Gilts have reclaimed 124.00 plus a bit more having eked a fresh peak at 124.13 before waning again, and getting somewhat closer to its previous trough (123.90). Core debt continues to acknowledge the overall positive risk tone, with Bunds still aware that BTPs remain firm, and supply could be another bearish factor given an abundance of corporate and institutional issuance ahead of this week&rsquo;s sovereign auctions that kick off promptly via 2 and 5 year US T-notes today (Usd81 bn in total). However, the Treasury curve is a tad steeper at present with the 10 year future just holding the psychological 122-00 handle and a whisker above chart support seen at 121-29 (a trend-line level). Turning to data, January&rsquo;s National Activity Index, December wholesale inventories and sales, plus February&rsquo;s Dallas Fed business index al to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight as WTI futures gave up opening gains despite the overall trade-driven optimism, although it is worth noting that Nigerian election polls have now closed with reports of dozens killed in election violence, however, there has been no reports of disrupted oil flow from the OPEC producer. Also, in spite of the Baker Hughes rig count showing a drop of four active rigs, US production reached a record high last week at 12mln BPD according to EIA data. Elsewhere, spot gold benefitted from the easing buck and hovered near Friday&rsquo;s highs, while copper traded choppy as initial trade-induced upside waned after Xinhua noted that US-China trade talks are said to become more difficult at the final stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary said Iran has designed and put into practice initiatives to neutralise the US sanctions against Iranian oil exports. He also noted that Iran has options to stop oil flow if threatened, other than closing Strait of Hormuz.

However, other regional currencies are also getting a boost on the prospect of a deal and wider repercussions for the global economy, with Usd/Zar down sharply from 13.9930 to 13.8480 at one stage, Usd/Rub under 65.2500 and Eur/Huf probing below 318.00 (Forint also appreciating Fitch&rsquo;s Hungarian upgrade to BBB/stable outlook).</p>\r\n",

The Liffe range so far is relatively confined between 123.99-124.12 compared to the previous settlement, while the 3 month strip has slipped to lows 0.5-1.5 ticks sub-parity after showing some resilience earlier and straddling Friday&rsquo;s closing levels off the open. Ahead, Monday&rsquo;s UK agenda is blank in terms of data, but BoE Governor Carney is on the docket, albeit at an FCA event so unlikely to touch upon the economy or monetary policy. Brexit-wise, this week&rsquo;s meaningful vote has been pushed back to March 12 amidst growing talk of a delay to the March 29 Article 50 deadline.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The 10 year German benchmark has extended overnight losses after closing an opening gap between 166.56 and last Friday&rsquo;s 166.62 close on the back of broad risk appetite prompted by a positive conclusion to the latest round of US-China trade talks, with sufficient or even significant progress made and subsequently this Friday&rsquo;s tariff deadline delayed to allow further negotiations. However, the core Eurozone debt future is also conceding ground to its Italian counterpart following Fitch retaining the country&rsquo;s BBB credit rating, albeit with a negative outlook. BTPs have been more than 100 ticks higher in response, but are now off best levels of 128.54 with 128.34 being flagged by some technical studies as a key level (February 19 high) on a closing basis and ahead of this week&rsquo;s EU review of Rome&rsquo;s 2019 budget, which is widely expected to be critical again. Returning to Bunds, some consolidation after a decline to 166.29 a short while ago.</p>\r\n",

She said MPs will be able to have a final vote on the Brexit deal by March 12th. Furthermore, senior government sources stated that the Premier could signal this week that she is taking a no-deal Brexit off the table. (BBC/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle are tabling an amendment that backs PM May&#39;s current Brexit deal with the condition of a second Brexit referendum.

As such EUR/USD made mild advances before hitting resistance at 1.1350, while GBP/USD was initially pressured by reports that UK PM May is seeking to extend Article 50 by two months in a bid to avoid further cabinet resignations, alongside confirmation that a meaningful vote will not take place this week. Elsewhere trade-proxy AUD/USD gained as the US President cited substantial progress with China on key issues, thus extending the March 1st deadline. AUD/USD breached its 50 DMA to the upside at 0.7134 to edge closer to its 100 DMA at 0.7161.

Gains were pressured with newswires attributing selling to optimism over US/China trade talks, which have been extended as policymakers say progress is being made, though failed to provide many specifics. Fed speak tended to focus on broader themes around policy frameworks rather than the current monetary policy/economic outlook; next week&#39;s dual testimony from Fed chair Powell is now eyed for cues about Fed policy. At settlement, major US curve spreads were little changed, with a slightly steeper bias. US T-note futures (h9) settled +7+ ticks at 122-04+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Clarida (Voter, Neutral) said the Fed is launching a broad review of policy framework, mulling changes to inflation-targeting framework; will consider new tools to ease policy if needed, such as capping treasury yields. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Quarles (Voter, Neutral) said he probably underestimated the difficulty of communications on the balance sheet; thinks balance sheet should move to shorter maturities. He added that it is appropriate to keep the balance sheet large enough to buffer against shocks to reserve supply and one option of ending balance sheet run off this year is to hold a fixed level of total assets for a time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bullard (voter, dove) said he does not want policy tools at cross purposes; doesn&#39;t want to cut the balance sheet and rates at the same time.&nbsp; He added that now that rates are higher, changes to balance sheet will only have minor impact. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Harker (Non-voter, Hawkish) says QT should end in 2019, says slow and steady approach will reduce uncertainty, and added that the Fed should be cautious with balance sheet wind down.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks kick-started the week with modest gains following a strong lead from Wall Street where the DJIA notched a 9-week winning streak and reclaimed the 26,000 level to the upside amid optimism surrounding a US-China trade deal. ASX 200 (Unch) opened marginally positive but gains in the material sector are offset by underperformance in the utilities and telecom names, whilst Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) advances are led by the IT and materials sectors. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp (+2.4%) outperforms as investors cheer US President Trump&rsquo;s announcement of an extension to the China tariff deadline, citing good progress on key issues whilst also noting plans for a Summit with Chinese President Xi. Meanwhile the CSI 300 (+2.4%), formed of major companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, surged into bull market territory, marking a 21% gain from cycle lows. Finally, Hang Seng (+0.3%) failed to grasp the same momentum as its mainland peers, with the index weighted on by the utilities sector after China Resources Power fell over 5% amid reports of delisting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY retreated from the 96.500 level after US President Trump acknowledged progression in US-Sino trade talks with a dialogue deadline extension. As such EUR/USD made mild advances before hitting resistance at 1.1350, whilst GBP/USD was initially pressured by reports via The Telegraph that UK PM May is seeking to extend Article 50 by two months in a bid to avoid further cabinet resignations, alongside confirmation that a meaningful vote will not take place this week. Elsewhere trade-proxy AUD/USD gained as US President Trump announced an extension to the US-China trade dialogue deadline which was originally set for March 1st. The Aussie climbed against the greenback as the US President cited substantial progress on key issues. AUD/USD breached its 50 DMA at 0.7134 to the upside to edge closer to its 100 DMA at 0.7161. Meanwhile, the Kiwi also kicked the week off on the front foot, initially spurred by the release of above-forecast retail sales before moving higher with its Australian counterpart on optimistic trade news. Finally, USD/CNY fell below 6.6900 for the first time since July 2018 ahead of its 100 WMA at 6.6642 as President Trump&rsquo;s optimistic trade tweet spurred demand in the Chinese currency.</p>\r\n",
