Lighthizer said substantial progress has been made on market access issues with China and the main thing that the US wants to do in China is prevent the non-economic transfer of technology. He expects a federal register notice to formally delay tariff increases on Chinese goods in the next few days; looking for an exclusion process for tariffs on USD 200bln round of Chinese goods. Furthermore, reports say USTR Lighthizer is unhappy with the reforms China has committed so far, says it is compromising too much.

The USTR added that the two nations are seriously engaged at the highest level, and significant progress has been made, including on market access issues. He confirmed that the US is looking for structural changes in Chinese policy, and that Congressional backing would be essential to persuade China to address these concerns. On the yuan, he argued that the weaker yuan had offset the 10% tariffs on $200bln of Chinese goods and he hopes to address this in negotiations, as well as the provisions on FX manipulation (he also added that FX issues had ben an issue with many countries in Asia, including Japan). On the legality of the deal, the USTR said it was negotiating to settle a Section 301 action, and therefore, would not require Congressional approval of any deal. On the USCMA, there has been some suggestions in news reports of late, that the deal was &#39;dead in the water&#39;; the USTR said that if it was not approved by Congress, it would be a disaster. Lighthizer said that the enforcement mechanism, if agreed, would entail a monthly, quarterly, and six-month review meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL TESTIMONY: </strong>Nothing particularly new or market moving from the Fed chair, reiterating that the Fed will halt QT this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK lawmakers took to vote on a range of amendments on Wednesday in what could be considered a non-event, following Theresa May&rsquo;s concessions made on Tuesday, rendering the vote meaningless. However, while the GBP action was non-existent through the voting, it was noted that on Amendment F (which notes May&#39;s commitment to hold a vote on March 14th on whether to delay Brexit, if Parliament has rejected her deal and leaving without a deal), was accepted, but in a show of strength, 20 Tory lawmakers ignored a three-line whip and voted against the government. The incident highlights again how split lawmakers are, and the obstacles May faces in pushing her deal through in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PENDING HOME SALES:</strong> The US pending home sales index increased by 4.6% in January to 103.3, well above the expected 0.4% increase and a reversal on the previous 2.2% decrease. This increase has painted the housing sector in a somewhat brighter place then it is was in Q4 2018, an easing of Fed policy causing mortgage rates to fall most very likely played a part in the index&rsquo;s revival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US GOODS TRADE BALANCE:</strong> The deficit widened from USD 70.5bln to a record USD 79.50bln, wider than the consensus view. &quot;Two stories are at work in the trade numbers,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics said, &quot;first, the combination of relatively strong domestic demand, boosted by tax cuts and lower gas prices, coupled with softening global demand, is a toxic combination,&quot; additionally, Pantheon notes that the threat of increased tariffs on imports from China appears to have prompted precautionary inventory-building; &quot;This won&#39;t continue indefinitely, and some of it should reverse when a trade deal with China is signed.&quot; However, for now, Pantheon believes that the rate of increase of the deficit &quot;looks alarming, and it means that foreign trade was a drag on Q4 GDP growth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN CPI: </strong>Inflation dipped in January, as analysts were predicting, falling to 1.4% YY. The three BOC measures were unchanged, averaging 1.87%. &quot;Most&nbsp; of the&nbsp; dip&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; headline rate&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1.4% year-over-year from&nbsp; 2.0%&nbsp; in&nbsp; December&nbsp; came from&nbsp; a pull-back in energy prices and a retracement of a December surge in airfares,&quot; RBC noted, &quot;The latter has been highly volatile since Statistics Canada implemented a new methodology for tracking airfares last year.&quot; Going forward, RBC suggests that the unpredictable volatility may continue. RBC said that beyond energy price volatility and wild swings in airfares, underlying inflation trends are still running right around the BOC&#39;s 2% price target; &quot;The BOC&#39;s three preferred &#39;core&#39; inflation measures averaged 1.9% in January and have been remarkably stable in the 1.9%-2.0% range sinc February of last year,&quot; and &quot;the&nbsp; inflation data is still consistent with an economy running at capacity, but has shown no sign of breaking unsustainably higher.&quot; RBC continues to believe that there is a little more room for rates to move up from low levels, but with earlier rate hikes and regulatory measures already slowing household debt growth and inflation trends still tame there is little push for the central bank to rush.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLED USD 1.44 HIGHER AT USD 56.94/BBL, BRENT (J9) SETTLED USD 1.18 HIGHER AT USD 66.39/BBL. </strong>Oil prices caught a bid on Wednesday as the market traded off falling US crude inventories, as well as OPEC resistance to President Trump&rsquo;s distaste for higher prices, and seemed relatively unbothered by bearish supply updates from Libya and Nigeria. Crude was off to a strong footing after Tuesday night&rsquo;s API data showing an unexpected draw in crude stocks, support was given from Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih who said he sees a likelihood of an output cut extension in 2H 2019. Prices saw another leg up on the release of the DOE inventories which showed crude drawing by a whopping 8.6mln bbls, a shock to the expected build of 2.8mln and double the 4.2mln bbl draw recorded by the APIs. Breaking down the report, gasoline stocks drew 1.9mln bbls vs. the expected draw of 1.7mln bbls; distillate stocks drew 0.3mln bbls vs. the expected draw of 1.9mln bbls; Cushing, Oklahoma built by 1.6mln bbls; production increased to a record 12.1mln bbls. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC reported that its 300k BPD capacity El Sharara oilfield is slowly coming back into production. Nigerian Forcados crude oil supply is to increase to 168k BPD in April vs. March 166k BPD, Bonda to rise to 190k BPD in April vs. March 153k BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.05% at 2792, NDX -0.09% at 7117, DJI -0.28% at 25985. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.39%, Materials -0.26%, Industrials +0.36%, Cons Discretionary -0.04%, Cons Staples -0.09%, Healthcare -0.49%, Financials +0.35%, Tech -0.10%, Telecoms -0.39%, Utilities +0.11%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>EOG Resources (EOG) was an outperformer on Wednesday, boosted from strong Q4 revenue and a strong bounce in crude prices from depleting US energy inventories; the energy sector as a whole was a leading sector with chunky names ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) pushing higher. Mylan (MYL) nosedived on the open after it provided a gloomy profit outlook. Campbell Soup (CPB) surged on the open after beating top and bottom line estimates, as well as showing progress on the sale of parts of its business. Best Buy (BBY) saw double digit gains on a strong profit forecast and earnings, other retail names TJX Companies (TJX) and Lowe&rsquo;s Companies (LOW) also outperformed on strong earnings reports. Airlines (UAL, ALK, DAL, AAL, SAVE) dropped on higher fuel prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 13 TICKS LOWERAT 121-29+. </strong>The US curve bear steepened on Wednesday. There was speculation as to what the trigger of today&rsquo;s downside was, with the most convincing explanation that accounts were putting on steepeners to hedge the upcoming IG supply in the long-end, which in turn set-off sell programmes. The steepeners were said to be inspired by Powell&rsquo;s rhetoric, though his comments over the last two day&rsquo;s have not really provided all that new to the FOMC narrative; it seems traders have been comforted by his continuing talk of pause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The DXY has been knocking around the 96.00 mark, and doesn&#39;t seem to be influenced by month-end factors too strongly, just yet. Barclays FX Month-End Rebalancing sees moderate-to-strong USD selling. It&#39;s passive rebalancing model at month-end points to strong USD selling versus the EUR, CAD and AUD and moderate selling against the JPY and GBP; Barx said the signal is stronger than its preliminary run of the model, which pointed to weak USD selling. Natwest Markets has been talking about its medium-term bearish USD view, and argues that whether the Buck is expensive today or not is open to interpretation, but it says that &quot;certainly the direction of travel for reliable US dollar signals is down.&quot; Natwest points out that the EUR has been supported by unhedged equity inflows, while sentiment indicators for both US and Eurozone have fallen similarly, adding that it seems strange that the USD is holding up so well while gold prices have edged up, and real yields have been falling, while DXY continues to patrol the 96.00 to 97.00 range, a range other desks believe will continue so long as volatility remains contained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Following PM May&#39;s significant concessions -- which the market has taken as an indication that the chances of a no-deal Brexit have diminished -- GBP has been punchy, testing the 1.33 figure on Wednesday trade. We noted on Tuesday how some desks warned of chasing further GBP upside at these levels, and there was more on that theme today; &quot;There are doubtless more twists and turns to come and as GBPUSD tests 1.33, chasing it higher seems dangerous,&quot; SocGen&#39;s FX strategists said, &quot;but we still expect sterling to be at $1.40 this time next year in the absence of a no-deal exit, (and at $1.20 in the case of no-deal).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>positive Brexit news has helped support EUR in recent weeks, though ahead of the series of votes in UK Parliament, was trading negative. However, nothing on the data slate or central bank speak of late has done much to alter the narrative, and accordingly, the well worn ranges look to still be in play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Havens were a beneficiary of risk-off theme overnight, with tensions between nuclear powers India and Pakistan ratcheting up, souring risk sentiment. However, much of the haven effect wore-off before the US cash open, with steepeners being put through in the TPLEX to hedge against corporate supply, which sent yields up, with USDJPY rising as rate differentials supported the USD. UBS&#39; analysts were looking at EURJPY, and pointed out that it keeps pushing for higher levels with buyers lined up below 125.00, but it struggles above 126.00, and its trading desk expects more sellers to show up ahead of 127.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, AUD, NZD: </strong>Canadian CPI data missed expectations, though with the BOC measures unchanged, didn&#39;t manage to change BOC pricing, which looks flat over the course of 2019. The antipodes were off and are heading into APAC trade on the back foot, with soft risk sentiment being widely cited, while month end factors were also cited by some desks, and technical factors were also suggested (break of 100 and 200 DMAs around 0.7140). Data overnight did little to help. Attention will remain on the progress of US/China trade talks, as well as the Aussie CAPEX data due overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>The USD hardly strengthened by any worrying magnitude on Wednesday, though EMFX still took a hit on the generally softer risk sentiment. SocGen&#39;s analysts are concerned about the EMFX complex, noting that they have shown a muted response to the dovish repricing of US and global monetary policy, as well as better news flow on the US-China trade war. &quot;The underwhelming recovery in EM currencies as these factors shifted from negative to positive is a &#39;red flag&#39; and indicates a growing asymmetry (greater chance of EM FX weakening) in future price action,&quot; SocGen says, though it says that there are two factors that could keep EM FX stronger for longer, the bakn argues: &quot;(1) positive data surprises - the Citi global economic surprise index is near the bottom of the 15-year range and positive surprises (even if data is not improving in absolute terms) could boost sentiment, and (2) Chinese growth - further improvement in Chinese credit (TSF, or shadow lending) could indicate previous monetary easing is working or the authorities are content to allow some short-term re-leveraging.&quot; SocGen says that if the market warms to the possibility of Chinese growth stabilising for a prolonged period, like 2016-17, it would be beneficial for EM FX.</p>\r\n",

Crude was off to a strong footing after Tuesday night&rsquo;s API data showing an unexpected draw in crude stocks, support was given from Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih who said he sees a likelihood of an output cut extension in 2H 2019. Prices saw another leg up on the release of the DOE inventories which showed crude drawing by a whopping 8.6mln bbls, a shock to the expected build of 2.8mln and double the 4.2mln bbl draw recorded by the APIs. Breaking down the report, gasoline stocks drew 1.9mln bbls vs. the expected draw of 1.7mln bbls; distillate stocks drew 0.3mln bbls vs. the expected draw of 1.9mln bbls; Cushing, Oklahoma built by 1.6mln bbls; production increased to a record 12.1mln bbls. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC reported that its 300k BPD capacity El Sharara oilfield is slowly coming back into production. Nigerian Forcados crude oil supply is to increase to 168k BPD in April vs. March 166k BPD, Bonda to rise to 190k BPD in April vs. March 153k BPD.</p>\r\n",

Cable has now clearly broken above 1.3298 resistance, through 1.3300 and briefly above 1.3325 where circa 1 bn option expiries roll off tomorrow to a high of 1.3336 before waning, while Eur/Gbp has tested chart support just shy of 0.8550. However, the Nok and Sek have emerged as the next best G10 currencies to replace the Swiss Franc that has lost some of its safe-haven appeal despite ongoing/heightened Indian-Pakistani tensions. Back to the Kronas, data has helped the Nok and Sek, but the former has also received a boost from oil alongside the Loonie after a minor wobble in wake of benign Canadian CPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, Eur/Nok has eased further towards 9.7000 and Eur/Sek closer to 10.5300, while Usd/CHF is currently back up around the middle of a 0.9963-1.0012 range and Usd/CAD also halfway between its trading parameters of 1.3118-77.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending overnight losses on a bearish/negative combination of weak Aussie and Kiwi data alongside the aforementioned escalating hostilities between India and Pakistan, with Aud/Usd retreating below 0.7150 and chart support and Nzd/Usd under 0.6850 as the cross holds relatively steady above 1.0400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unwinding relatively mild safe-haven gains (compared to the Chf) as the Dollar digs its heels in and DXY recovers from worst levels to peer over 96.000 again. US data and Fed chair Powell part 2 not really impacting, but a spike/rebound in Treasury yields along with more curve steepening has pushed the headline pair back up towards 111.00 vs 110.36 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively rangebound throughout Wednesday&rsquo;s session within 1.1404-1.1373, and supported by month-end flows (broad Usd sell signal said to be modest, but stronger for choice vs the single currency) vs strong technical resistance capping gains beyond the big figure.</p>\r\n",

Hopes therefore have been raised that the two are close to a trade deal, which could be signed off by Trump and China President Xi sometime in March. However, recent communicatoins from officials have essentially failed to provide any meaningful detail on the nature of the progress, and the exact commitments China has made. The FT writes that markets would like details on China&#39;s purchase of US goods (it is expected to ramp up agricultural imports), what steps will be taken to protect US intellectual property rights (amid claims China has been stealing it from US companies), what exactly has China committed to regarding FX stability (it has pledged stability, though this is a line the PBOC has been taking for some time), what agreements has China made with regards to subsidies of its state-owned enterprises, and how any deal between the two nations will be enforced? Additionally, if a deal is reached, how will tariffs be adjusted?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) How strained is the relationship between Lighthizer and Trump? </strong>The NYT today writes that as Trump backs off from his threat to impose higher tariffs, the President&#39;s relationship with Lighthizer is showing signs of strain, and adds that while broad tariffs on Chinese imports brought Beijing to the negotiating table, Trump has grown impatient with the talks, and a consensus is growing in Washington that Trump will ultimately accept a weak deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Is USMCA dead in the water? </strong>Business Insider reported that Lighthizer met Democrats on the Ways &amp; Means Committee on Tuesday to field questions about the USMCA; Democrat House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer characterised the White House as not actively pushing Congress to pass the deal, with Business Insider also reporting that Republicans have suggested that the USMCA might already be dead in the water.</p>\r\n",

In fact, Bunds have been hit really hard from a marginal new Eurex high of 166.48 to a fresh low of 166.03 in very short order and Gilts also slipped to another Liffe trough at 126.48 (-41 ticks) with US Treasuries even though US trade was worse than expected vs a retail inventory beat. The rationale/catalysts, probably a combination of factors as the curve steepens further post-Powell amidst more supply, and this in turn said to have tripped various stops. Back to FX, and Usd/Cad has been particularly volatile for obvious reasons with a knee-jerk rise on the benign Canadian CPI report before a bigger pull-back as crude prices continue to barrel higher.</p>\r\n",

There is some mild underperformance in the Dax (-0.7%) where only 3 companies are in the green; although losses are limited by strong performance in Bayer (+4.5%) after the Co. posted a beat on their Q4 sales. Sectors are similarly broadly in the red, with underperformance seen in consumer staples. Other notable movers include, Marks &amp; Spencer (-9.5%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. are considering a rights offering to fund their joint venture with Ocado (+4.7%). Air France (-11.7%) are down as the Dutch government has taken a 12.7% shareholding in the Co. in an attempt to protect their interests; which may lead to tensions with France who hold a 14.3% stake in the Co. Rio Tinto (+0.4%) are in the green after posting a significant increase in FY net earnings of USD 13.64bln vs. Prev. USD 8.76bln alongside the announcement of a special dividend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD The Dollar continues to sag in wake of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s reinforcement of the new patient policy stance and on portfolio rebalancing for the turn of the month. The DXY has retreated below 96.000 as a result, and with additional downside pressure coming from the escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan that has prompted greater demand for safer currency havens relative to the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP The Franc and Pound are vying for pole position within the G10 ranks, as the former benefits from defensive positioning amidst the aforementioned rise in Indian-Pakistani hostilities, with Usd/Chf reversing more definitively from par-plus levels to around 0.9970. Meanwhile, Sterling has extended gains on the back of Tuesday&rsquo;s marked turnaround on Brexit from UK PM May that raises the prospect of a delay to Article 50 and odds on a no deal or cliff edge conclusion to the already protracted withdrawal process. Cable is now probing 1.3300 after eclipsing resistance just shy of the big figure (1.3298 high from September 2018), while Eur/Gbp is hovering around 0.8570 and eyeing chart support a few pips below, like a Fib at 0.8548.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY The next best majors, with the Loonie drawing comfort/support from a rebound in crude prices and the more pronounced downturn in the Usd, to rebound firmly over 1.3200 again and pivot 1.3150, while Usd/Jpy has now breached its 100 DMA more convincingly to trade under 110.40. Note, 110.00 should be well supported given the 30 DMA at 110.02, and with hefty expiries looming at the strike on Thursday (2 bn), and next up for the CAD top-tier Canadian CPI data and avg. earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK Contrasting fortunes for the more high-beta and risk sensitive Antipodean Dollars and Scandi Crowns, as the Aussie and Kiwi underperform in wake of disappointing data overnight (Q4 construction and January trade respectively), but the Nok and Sek glean protection from the overall risk averse environment with the aid of upbeat macro releases (retail sales, manufacturing and overall industry sentiment, plus trade). Aud/Usd is currently near the bottom of a 0.7198-65 range, Nzd/Usd close to 0.6874 vs 0.6901 at one stage, while Eur/Nok is under 9.7200 and Eur/Sek around 10.5500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR The single currency is also gaining at the expense of the Greenback, with one prominent bank flagging strongest month end Usd sell signals against the Eur. However, technical obstacles around 1.1400 are proving tough to overcome and the decline in Eur/Gbp noted above is also hampering the single currency to a degree</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have embarked on a decent &frac14; point or so recovery from worst levels, and technical buying may have contributed to the bounce as chart support in the 166.16-11 area was well and truly tested, but not breached (166.10 low). However, a strong German 10 year auction is likely to have helped, albeit somewhat belatedly, while further underperformance in Italian BTPs following heavy and more costly issuance is also supportive, as the EU pours more scorn on the country&rsquo;s 2019 budget. Meanwhile, Gilts have also pared some losses from a deeper 126.63 Liffe base, but remain under pressure on Brexit, and US Treasuries are idling into Powell part 2 and a deluge of US data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.3%) and WTI (+1.6%) prices are higher and trading towards the top of the sessions range, after yesterday&rsquo;s unexpected -4.2mln draw in API Weekly Crude Inventories compared with the expectations for a +2.8mln build. Recent newsflow has seen comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih saying that he sees a likelihood of an output cuts extension in H2 and are aiming for March oil exports of 7mln BPD. Separately, the Russian Energy ministry is reportedly planning to meet with Russian oil companies on March 1st in order to discuss the OPEC+ deal. Elsewhere, Nigerian President Buhari has won the re-election, which is to be contested in court and oil prices were little affected by the CME group&rsquo;s technical issues which resulted in WTI live prices being unavailable for a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) is flat as it follows the dollar after the first testimony by Fed&rsquo;s Chair Powell yesterday to the Senate and ahead of his testimony to the house today at GMT 15:00. Elsewhere, Freeport&rsquo;s CEO has instructed his employees to immediately report any safety concerns regarding dams the Co. operate; following January&rsquo;s Vale mine disaster. Separately, Copper has slipped slightly from it&rsquo;s 7-month high which was spurred by falling supply and dollar weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China are reportedly to unveil plans to form a national oil &amp; gas pipeline group, pipeline reform is the largest oil ans gas sector reshuffle in decades; according to sources.

There is some mild underperformance in the Dax (-0.7%) where only 3 companies are in the green; although losses are limited by strong performance in Bayer (+4.5%) after the Co. posted a beat on their Q4 sales. Sectors are similarly broadly in the red, with underperformance seen in consumer staples. Other notable movers include, Marks &amp; Spencer (-9.5%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. are considering a rights offering to fund their joint venture with Ocado (+4.7%). Air France (-11.7%) are down as the Dutch government has taken a 12.7% shareholding in the Co. in an attempt to protect their interests; which may lead to tensions with France who hold a 14.3% stake in the Co. Rio Tinto (+0.4%) are in the green after posting a significant increase in FY net earnings of USD 13.64bln vs. Prev. USD 8.76bln alongside the announcement of a special dividend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD The Dollar continues to sag in wake of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s reinforcement of the new patient policy stance and on portfolio rebalancing for the turn of the month. The DXY has retreated below 96.000 as a result, and with additional downside pressure coming from the escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan that has prompted greater demand for safer currency havens relative to the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP The Franc and Pound are vying for pole position within the G10 ranks, as the former benefits from defensive positioning amidst the aforementioned rise in Indian-Pakistani hostilities, with Usd/Chf reversing more definitively from par-plus levels to around 0.9970. Meanwhile, Sterling has extended gains on the back of Tuesday&rsquo;s marked turnaround on Brexit from UK PM May that raises the prospect of a delay to Article 50 and odds on a no deal or cliff edge conclusion to the already protracted withdrawal process. Cable is now probing 1.3300 after eclipsing resistance just shy of the big figure (1.3298 high from September 2018), while Eur/Gbp is hovering around 0.8570 and eyeing chart support a few pips below, like a Fib at 0.8548.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY&nbsp; The next best majors, with the Loonie drawing comfort/support from a rebound in crude prices and the more pronounced downturn in the Usd, to rebound firmly over 1.3200 again and pivot 1.3150, while Usd/Jpy has now breached its 100 DMA more convincingly to trade under 110.40. Note, 110.00 should be well supported given the 30 DMA at 110.02, and with hefty expiries looming at the strike on Thursday (2 bn), and next up for the CAD top-tier Canadian CPI data and avg. earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK Contrasting fortunes for the more high-beta and risk sensitive Antipodean Dollars and Scandi Crowns, as the Aussie and Kiwi underperform in wake of disappointing data overnight (Q4 construction and January trade respectively), but the Nok and Sek glean protection from the overall risk averse environment with the aid of upbeat macro releases (retail sales, manufacturing and overall industry sentiment, plus trade). Aud/Usd is currently near the bottom of a 0.7198-65 range, Nzd/Usd close to 0.6874 vs 0.6901 at one stage, while Eur/Nok is under 9.7200 and Eur/Sek around 10.5500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR The single currency is also gaining at the expense of the Greenback, with one prominent bank flagging strongest month end Usd sell signals against the Eur. However, technical obstacles around 1.1400 are proving tough to overcome and the decline in Eur/Gbp noted above is also hampering the single currency to a degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have embarked on a decent &frac14; point or so recovery from worst levels, and technical buying may have contributed to the bounce as chart support in the 166.16-11 area was well and truly tested, but not breached (166.10 low). However, a strong German 10 year auction is likely to have helped, albeit somewhat belatedly, while further underperformance in Italian BTPs following heavy and more costly issuance is also supportive, as the EU pours more scorn on the country&rsquo;s 2019 budget. Meanwhile, Gilts have also pared some losses from a deeper 126.63 Liffe base, but remain under pressure on Brexit, and US Treasuries are idling into Powell part 2 and a deluge of US data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.3%) and WTI (+1.6%) prices are higher and trading towards the top of the sessions range, after yesterday&rsquo;s unexpected -4.2mln draw in API Weekly Crude Inventories compared with the expectations for a +2.8mln build. Recent newsflow has seen comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih saying that he sees a likelihood of an output cuts extension in H2 and are aiming for March oil exports of 7mln BPD. Separately, the Russian Energy ministry is reportedly planning to meet with Russian oil companies on March 1st in order to discuss the OPEC+ deal. Elsewhere, Nigerian President Buhari has won the re-election, which is to be contested in court and oil prices were little affected by the CME group&rsquo;s technical issues which resulted in WTI live prices being unavailable for a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) is flat as it follows the dollar after the first testimony by Fed&rsquo;s Chair Powell yesterday to the Senate and ahead of his testimony to the house today at GMT 15:00. Elsewhere, Freeport&rsquo;s CEO has instructed his employees to immediately report any safety concerns regarding dams the Co. operate; following January&rsquo;s Vale mine disaster. Separately, Copper has slipped slightly from it&rsquo;s 7-month high which was spurred by falling supply and dollar weakness.</p>\r\n",

Note, 110.00 should be well supported given the 30 DMA at 110.02, and with hefty expiries looming at the strike on Thursday (2 bn), while next up for the Cad is top-tier Canadian CPI data, and average earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the more high-beta and risk sensitive Antipodean Dollars and Scandi Crowns, as the Aussie and Kiwi underperform in wake of disappointing data overnight (Q4 construction and January trade respectively), but the Nok and Sek glean protection from the overall risk averse environment with the aid of upbeat macro releases (retail sales, manufacturing and overall industry sentiment, plus trade). Aud/Usd is currently near the bottom of a 0.7198-65 range, Nzd/Usd close to 0.6874 vs 0.6901 at one stage, while Eur/Nok is under 9.7200 and Eur/Sek around 10.5500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is also gaining at the expense of the Greenback, with one prominent bank flagging strongest month end Usd sell signals against the Eur. However, technical obstacles around 1.1400 are proving tough to overcome and the decline in Eur/Gbp noted above is also hampering the single currency to a degree.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, the Short Sterling strip has also wilted and steepened further after a relatively resilient or steady start, as rate expectations adjust to latest Brexit developments that effectively lessen the chances of Britain leaving the EU with no deal, although that eventuality is still technically possible.

As such, EUR/USD traded sideways just below its 100 DMA at 1.1390, whilst GBP/USD meandered around 1.3250 ahead of key resistance at 1.3298 (September high). JP Morgan believes that the Pound has fully discounted positive Brexit news, and added that only a decisive break above Cable&rsquo;s September high and below EUR/GBP support at 0.8541 would confirm a higher-scale change.

Since the move higher, the energy benchmarks traded sideways throughout most of the Asia-Pac session amid a lack of catalysts and as traders await the release of the weekly DoE&rsquo;s which last week, showed US crude production rising to a record high of 12mln BPD. Elsewhere, spot gold failed to reclaim USD 1330/oz to the upside and was largely dominated by the greenback. Meanwhile, copper held steady around seven-month highs as falling supply and a pullback in the Dollar underpinned the red metal. Finally, spot palladium remained above USD 1550/oz amid widening supply tightness in the market alongside threats of strikes by South African mineworkers providing the metal with additional support.

Demand also remained resilient in later trade where the US sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes, with strong demand exhibited through a bid-to-cover ratio at 2.6x and stopping through the when issued by 0.9bps, where the six-auction average comes in on the screws. Breaking down the buyers, direct bidders took their largest share (28.42%) since March 2014, indirect bidders however exhibited weak foreign demand where they took their smallest share in three years. Going into settlement, treasuries remained near highs with the 7-year yield falling the most, c. -3.5bps.

ASX 200 (+0.4%) gains are led by energy names following gains in the complex amid sources reports that OPEC are to stick to their output curb agreement alongside bullish API inventories data, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) is led by outperformance in the healthcare sector. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp (+0.4%) and Hang Seng (+0.4%) extended on gains from the open with the former supported by IT names whilst the latter benefits from the strong performance in heavyweight energy names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet as the DXY roams just above the 96.000 level as month-end rebalancing pulled the index further below the prior day&rsquo;s highs of around 96.500. As such, EUR/USD trades sideways just below its 100 DMA at 1.1390, whilst GBP/USD meanders around 1.3250 ahead of key resistance at 1.3298 (September high). JP Morgan believes that the Pound has fully discounted positive Brexit news, and added that only a decisive break above Cable&rsquo;s September high and below EUR/GBP support at 0.8541 would confirm a higher-scale change. Elsewhere, the antipodeans were dented by below-forecast data wherein the Kiwi was hit by a wider than expected trade deficit, alongside lower exports and downward revisions to the metrics. Meanwhile, AUD/USD was sent further below the 0.7200 level amid a significant miss in Q4 construction work done.</p>\r\n",
