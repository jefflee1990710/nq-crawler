Amid fading coronavirus, casinos (MGM, WYNN, MLCO, LVS) joined in the relief rally, as did the vulnerable cruise liners (NGHL, CCL, RCL), although Royal Caribbean’s gains lagged after printing a revenue miss and warnings that the virus would weigh on sales; other China exposed stocks (TCOM, TRIP, NKE, AAPL, CAT) and ADRs (BABA, JD, BIDU) were other outperformers; China large cap ETF (FXI) also gained. Textron (TXT) caught a strong bid after WSJ reported it was in discussions to acquire Bombardier’s (BDRBF) business-jet unit.

The selling of the T-Note was clear sailing throughout the session as participants cited several factors: coronavirus fears abating with China pledging economic stimulus, preliminary polls for the more moderate Buttigieg surprised higher in the Iowa caucus, fallout from Monday’s strong ISM Manufacturing print in the US and the above consensus Factory Orders print, and position unwinding ahead of the Treasury refunding announcement on Wednesday (exp. USD 38bln 3-years, USD 27bln 10-years and USD 19bln 30-years). This proverbial cocktail of factors saw the most pronounced steepening in the front-to-belly (2s5s +2bps, 2s10s +2bps, 2s30s +1.5bps), helping the 10-year yield rise back above 1.60%, after concerns of it breaking though 1.50%. US T-note (H0) settled 22 ticks lower at 130-28+.</p>",

Currently, results, as according to US Senator Sanders’ press release, shows Sanders on track to win the Caucus with 29.66% of the votes, Buttigieg 22.59%, Warren 21.24%, Biden 12.37%, Klobuchar 11%, although the results are from only 40% of the Iowa precincts, therefore not a complete score. In terms of recent Iowa averages, RealClearPolitics have: Sanders 23.0%, Biden 19.3%, Buttigieg 16.8%, Warren 15.5%, Klobuchar 9.0%. On a national level, the averages show Biden 27.0%, Sanders 23.7%, Warren 15.0%, Bloomberg 8.3%, Buttigieg 6.5%.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The death toll rose to 425, and over 20k cases have been confirmed. China announced it has suspended all activities for the Canton fair as a result of nCov. The fair is regarded as being the largest and most representative trade fair which takes place in China, although, organisers have stated they have only suspended proceedings and the fair has not been cancelled entirely; it is perhaps not too surprising that they have elected to suspend proceedings given the uncertainty around the virus and that a number of airlines have cancelled their operations to China for the foreseeable future. Elsewhere, the first death was reported in HK, and Macau is asking local casinos to shut operations for 15 days amid the coronavirus outbreak. In a sign of the impact on supply chains, automaker Hyundai said it was halting production in South Korea due to a shortage of components from China. NEC Director Kudlow on the matter, expects the coronavirus to have a minimal impact on supply chains, noting it is not a catastrophe, although there may be some component shortages to a point. Kudlow did, however, state it could see a step up in US production and it could potentially impact automakers, although healthcare would likely be affected more.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Left rates unchanged at 0.75%, and the easing bias was retained, though desks said the statement was less dovish than anticipated. The Board has left 2020 and 2021 growth forecasts unchanged at 2.75% and 3.00% respectively and stated that \"it is too early to determine how long lasting the impact [of the coronavirus] will be.\" The RBA also tweaked its view of global growth, which is now \"expected to be a little stronger this year and next than it was last year\" (versus December's \"outlook for the global economy remains reasonable\"), which can be seen as a surprising modest lift in confidence around the world economy given the current recent market developments, Westpac says. The jobless rate forecast has been lowered to 5.1% from 5.25%, and the central bank still sees it sub-5.00% in 2021 -- the RBA repeated that \"the Australian economy can sustain lower rates of unemployment and underemployment\", which Westpac argues emphasises the desirability of further falls in the unemployment rate. Meanwhile, Westpac also finds it interesting that the statement does not repeat the description \"gentle turning point\" although the arguments pointing to an improving growth outlook – the low level of interest rates; tax refunds; ongoing spending on infrastructure; a brighter outlook for resources – is now supplemented by a more confident outlook for the residential construction cycle where the statement points to an expected recovery later this year. The AUD's performance is now described as \"around its lowest level over recent times\" (vs. \"at the lower end of its range in recent times\"), which Westpac says may imply some inconsistency in this observation given that if, as the growth forecasts imply, the economy bounces back from the short term shocks, a recovery in the AUD is almost certainly going to be an outcome. Finally, the final paragraph emphasised&nbsp; the long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy, the Board is prepared to ease policy further if needed; the previous line that the Board \"continues to monitor developments, including in the labour market\" has been tweaked to \"the Board will continue to monitor developments carefully, including in the labour market\", which Westpac says may suggest that the Board being more uncertain about future developments, and therefore wanting to emphasise its strong duty of care. Meanwhile, overnight, Governor Lowe will deliver his 'year ahead' speech, ahead of the RBA's release of its SOMP on Friday.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US President Trump’s administration is going ahead with rules that will pave the way for the US to apply tariffs on goods from countries accused of having undervalued currencies. The idea would allow US companies to file complaints with the Commerce Department regarding specified products from countries which the US believes to be deliberately undervaluing its currency, which would act as unfair subsidy. Although China was removed from the currency manipulator list as part of the Phase One agreement, the report highlights “It would allow the U.S. to impose countervailing duties on goods from countries accused of manipulating their currencies, even in cases where they were not officially found to be guilty of that by the U.S. Treasury”. The response from the Chinese saw a trade expert with the Chinese Commerce Ministry question whether the US is reneging on the Phase One deal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.5% at 3298, NDX +2.1% at 9468, DJI +1.44% at 28,808.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) stunned onlookers further as it opened above the USD900/shr figure alongside more bullish comments, this time from investor Ron Baron, who sees potential for USD 1trln in sales within a decade. eBay (EBAY) opened higher after activist investor Starboard Value expressed potential value from strategic initiatives, although the stock pared gains through the session, before a sharp spike higher in the late-session on WSJ sources reporting it had been approached by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) for a potential takeout offer which could value it at over USD 30bln – seeing ICE shares slump. Amid fading coronavirus, casinos (MGM, WYNN, MLCO, LVS) joined in the relief rally, as did the vulnerable cruise liners (NGHL, CCL, RCL), although Royal Caribbean’s gains lagged after printing a revenue miss and warnings that the virus would weigh on sales; other China exposed stocks (TCOM, TRIP, NKE, AAPL, CAT) and ADRs (BABA, JD, BIDU) were other outperformers; China large cap ETF (FXI) also gained. Textron (TXT) caught a strong bid after WSJ reported it was in discussions to acquire Bombardier’s (BDRBF) business-jet unit.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Alphabet (GOOGL) weighed on the Communications sector after a disappointing Revenue print, particularly in its key Google advertisements unit. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) conversely firmed on a strong Revenue print and Q1 guidance. Ralph Lauren (RL) was a top performer on a stellar earnings report and raising its FY20 Revenue guidance. ConocoPhillips (COP) was offered after disappointing quarterly profits and production cuts. Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH), Clorox (CLX) and Eaton (ETN) were other strong performers post-earnings reports, whilst Gartner (IT), Waters (WAT), Hartford Financial (HIG) and TransDigm (TDG) all underperformed following their reports.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLES USD 0.50 LOWER AT USD 49.61/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 0.49 LOWER AT USD 53.96/BBL</strong></p><p>The oil market settled lower, reversing its earlier gains, excluding itself from the wider revival in risk appetite on Tuesday. Prices had been on the front-foot going into the US session, but lacklustre OPEC+ responses from Russia and the ongoing JTC, in addition to wider supply concerns, reversed the price action. Russian Energy Minister Novak said that OPEC+ may hold a ministerial meeting prior to March (something which has frequently been touted by others), but says it is premature to say if it will be Feb 14/15 and whether it is the correct time to deepen production cuts. At the OPEC Joint Technical Committee (JTC), taking place on both Tuesday and Wednesday, production cuts were not discussed but will reportedly be mentioned on Wednesday, whilst the group studied between 200-400k BPD impact on oil demand due to the coronavirus, delegates reported. Additionally, an earlier WSJ sources report suggested that the JTC said OPEC is likely to ease curbs later in the year to avoid undersupplying markets. There could be an element of book-squaring or hesitance ahead of the US.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) SETTLED 22 TICKS LOWER AT 130-28+: </strong>The TPLEX saw bear-steepening on Tuesday as markets ramped up their risk appetites. The selling of the T-Note was clear sailing throughout the session as participants cited several factors: coronavirus fears abating with China pledging economic stimulus, preliminary polls for the more moderate Buttigieg surprised higher in the Iowa caucus, fallout from Monday’s strong ISM Manufacturing print in the US and the above consensus Factory Orders print, and position unwinding ahead of the Treasury refunding announcement on Wednesday (exp. USD 38bln 3-years, USD 27bln 10-years and USD 19bln 30-years). This proverbial cocktail of factors saw the most pronounced steepening in the front-to-belly (2s5s +2bps, 2s10s +2bps, 2s30s +1.5bps), helping the 10-year yield rise back above 1.60%, after concerns of it breaking though 1.50%.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP</strong>:</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY remained firmer today ahead of tonight’s Iowa results, Trump’s State of the Union address, ISM Non-Manufacturing and ADP employment figures tomorrow. A firmer than expected industrial production and haven outflows also likely contributing to the dollar strength. DXY surpassed its 100 dma at 97.84 early this morning, with the index residing just shy of the 98.00 figure heading into overnight trade.</p><p><strong>* CNY, CNH:</strong> China's central bank injected CNY 400bln into the banking system overnight (and combined with yesterday's lowering of 7-day and 14-day RRP rates, has injected some CNY 550bln over the two sessions), and guided the USDCNY fix above 7.00 (6.9779 vs. 6.9249 on Monday, and lower than the consensus 6.9784). The tone of trade, however, has been more risk friendly on Tuesday, allowing the USDCNY to fall back sub-7.00. But UBS warns that the yuan above 7.00 could be a potential trigger for cross-asset weakness, citing August 2019, when the USDCNH premium over USDCNY began quickly widening. The bank also notes that CNY and CNH may be suffering from a lack of liquidity, given that many desks are still not fully manned, which may be resulting in more choppier price action than usual.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> traded weaker remaining within a 30pip range against the buck with participants eyeing heavy option expiries with 1bln rolling off in EURUSD between 1.1030-40. Deutsche Bank's FX desk has said EURUSD price action has been difficult to determine of late. But it adds that, with the data softening and risk/carry still vulnerable, it prefers longs over shorts for now. EURGBP initially breached 0.85 to the upside in the European session, however lost ground once again throughout the remainder of the US session.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Traded higher after the RBA left rates unchanged at 0.75% (there was some pricing for a cut), while more constructive sentiment also supported the currency. The AUD will of course remain sensitive to the impact of nCov. Recent Aussie weakness may have been another factor behind the RBA rate decision, writes Scotia. Note, RBA described AUD as \"around its lowest level over recent times\" (vs. \"at the lower end of its range in recent times\").</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> GBPUSD firmer today paring back some of the prior day losses as GBP claws back some of the post Johnson hard-line losses amid firmer Markit Construction PMI data. SocGen suggests that GBPCHF could be a way to express a widening rift between the UK/EU over trade. The pair managed to remain above 1.25 last month, though SocGen believes could attempt a breach; support is seen below at 1.2494, which opens the door to 1.23. For GBP, technicians eye the 100 dma around 1.2885, and the December low around 1.2905 as key levels to watch.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Weaker against the buck as risk appetite remains positive this week, USDJPY is back above 109.50 after topping its 50dma at 109.20. However, Credit Suisse warned this morning that short-term positioning/risk-hedge unwind is the reason why we have seen a bounce in risk. As such, it still eyes JPY shorts, looking for entries around 109.00/30.</p><p><strong>* XAU: </strong>The precious metal succumbed to the broader risk appetite and shed over USD 20 to see the yellow metal reside around the 1550 handle in the tail end of the session as risk appetite continue to improve amid China stimulus and decent US data.</p><p><strong>* CHF:</strong> The almost-five-year low around 1.0632 is in focus, as nCov uncertainty has added a bid into haven FX like the Swissy, a comment highlighted by SNB’s Jordan in late trade. We have heard warnings from the SNB of late about its willingness to intervene in FX, with Jordan stressing the bank is not a currency manipulator. Jordan reiterated CHF remains high but noted that current policy is correct as overall risks have not reduced, noting the bank would pose no concerns in regard to removing negative rates if needed, although noted it has room to move rates lower.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>USDCAD remained above 1.3250 as it resides around levels seen yesterday following the prior days slide in oil, however today’s continued fall seemingly had less of an impact. Elsewhere, BOC Deputy Governor Wilkins will give remarks on Wednesday. Markets currently price 26bps worth of easing at the September meeting. Both Wilkins and Poloz sounded dovish at the January BOC (where it did not cut rates, though left the door open to cuts ahead), however Beuadry held a less dovish stance in recent commentary.</p><p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Generally firmer against the buck apart from BRL which was hampered by poor industrial production figures, MXN performed well amid firmer Markit Manufacturing PMI data.</p>",

Prices had been on the front-foot going into the US session, but lacklustre OPEC+ responses from Russia and the ongoing JTC, in addition to wider supply concerns, reversed the price action. Russian Energy Minister Novak said that OPEC+ may hold a ministerial meeting prior to March (something which has frequently been touted by others), but says it is premature to say if it will be Feb 14/15 and whether it is the correct time to deepen production cuts. At the OPEC Joint Technical Committee (JTC), taking place on both Tuesday and Wednesday, production cuts were not discussed but will reportedly be mentioned on Wednesday, whilst the group studied between 200-400k BPD impact on oil demand due to the coronavirus, delegates reported. Additionally, an earlier WSJ sources report suggested that the JTC said OPEC is likely to ease curbs later in the year to avoid undersupplying markets. There could be an element of book-squaring or hesitance ahead of the US energy inventories, where current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +2.8mln, gasoline +2.1mln, distillates -0.01mln; private inventory data is due to be released later on Tuesday ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Sterling staged a comeback, but Aussie retains No1 G10 spot ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and index are poised to end the European session on a firmer footing, albeit off their intraday highs, potentially on the back of a recovering in the Sterling, which aided the index to surpass its 100 DMA (97.840) in early trade. Nonetheless, the index has clocked in a daily parameter of 97.784-963 (ahead of 98.000) and looks ahead to the delayed release of the Iowa caucus results, which may to some extent overshadow US President Trump’s State of Union Address (~0200GMT), given reports that Trump will be continuing to champion the US economy. That said, participants will still be on the lookout for anything related to trade with the EU and UK. Looking further ahead, tomorrow sees the release of the ADP National Employment figures followed by international trade, Markit PMIs (finals), and the ISM services PMI.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yuan</strong></p><p>The offshore heads to the European close having almost completely nursed yesterday’s virus-induced losses in light of a turnaround in risk sentiment coupled with proactive measures by China to curb the outbreak. USD/CNH remained contained within its 200 DMA (6.9863) and 100 DMA (7.0228), having fluctuated within a 6.9880-7.0230 daily band. The CNY finished its domestic session sub-7.00 and with the session’s price action contained within its respective 200 DMA (6.9889) and 100 DMA (7.0210).</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has retained an underlying bid post-RBA, which saw the Cash Rate unchanged, easing bias maintained, GDP forecasts left largely untouched and commentary surrounding bushfires and coronavirus less downbeat than some had anticipated. AUD/USD remained north of 0.6700 after hitting a high of 0.6732 vs. a pre-RBA 0.6680, with some tailwinds derived from the overall risk appetite. Next up, RBA Governor Lowe will be giving remarks at the National Press Club in Sydney (0130GMT) – an event traders will closely dissect given the Governor’s tendency to err slightly from decision statement – with attention on a more sophisticated assessment of the bushfire/virus impacts and effects on monetary policy. Meanwhile, NZD/USD meandered in a tight 0.6450-0.6475 with gains in the NZD potentially hampered as the AUD/NZD cross reclaimed 1.040 to the upside ahead of its 50 DMA ~1.0418. Kiwi traders will be looking ahead to the NZ labour market release later today.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>An impressive comeback staged by Sterling saw GBP/USD rebound off its fresh 2020 low of 1.2940 to a whisker away from 1.3050. Cable heads to the European close with modest gains having retained a 1.30+ since mid-session. Meanwhile, EUR/USD largely moved in tandem with the Buck amid a lack of pertinent/notable data and speakers and remained in a contained 20pip intraday rate between 1.1040-60. EUR/GBP meanwhile retreated back below 0.8500 and its 50 DMA (0.8488) in light of the aforementioned Sterling turnaround. Tomorrow’s docket could prove to be a busier one for the Single Currency, with EZ Services/Composite finals and a number of ECB speakers scheduled.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Safe-haven FX remained the G10 underperformers having conformed to the overall risk appetite. USD/JPY surpassed and extended gains above 109.00 (vs. low 108.56) before topping its 50 DMA (109.20) in a move which coincided with the US cash open. Similarly, USD/CHF gained further ground north of 0.9650 before testing 0.9700 to the upside (vs low 0.9657). Both pairs look set to end the European session towards the top of their respective ranges with eyes set on coronavirus developments, Iowa caucus results and US President Trump’s SoU address.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Widespread risk-on is also evident via a downbeat day for debt, with the sessions main event in the form of results from the Iowa Caucus delayed. Price action is consistent across core EZ bonds and their US peer, while peripherals have been somewhat directionless/rangebound. The change in sentiment was cemented with yesterday’s strong ISM print (note, this does not fully account for the coronavirus) after which due to the Iowa delay there has been no catalyst to divert the markets attention. Bunds are down to as low as 174.36 thus far, and look set to approach recent lows at 174.10; note, if downside exacerbates then we have clean-air through 174.0, 173.50 after which strong support resides at 173.41 in the form of a multisession low. Elsewhere, Gilts are similarly subdued and appear to have been the driver of the next bout of pressure post PMI, as January’s Construction component printed above exp. at 48.4 vs. 46.6 (Prev. 44.4) within this IHS commented ‘positivity reached its highest level since April 2018’. From a European standpoint there is nothing too notable scheduled for the remainder of the session. Moving stateside, where the broad down-tick in debt has lifted the 10-year yield to a high of 1.58, and well off of recent 1.50 lows. Looking ahead, participants remain on standby for Iowa, with no indicative release time as of yet; for reference, Sanders’ press release has him on track to win with circa 29.7% of votes, but this is derived from less than half of all precincts. Finally, as a reminder US President Trump is due to give his State of the Union Address today (21:00EST/02:00GM) which could well set the tone for Wednesday’s session.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>A firmer start to the session for the broad Dollar and Index in a continuation of yesterday’s momentum, although with some support derived from Sterling’s slip below 1.3000 vs. the Buck. State-side, Democratic Iowa caucuses results were delayed to later today due to discrepancies, although an incomplete poll released by Sanders party (representing only 40% of Iowa precincts) show Sanders (29.66%) and Buttigieg (24.59%) leading whilst Klobuchar (11.00%) tails, followed by Biden (12.37%) . DXY remains north of its 100 DMA ~97.84 with the index eyeing 98.000 to the upside for potential resistance. In terms of the docket, Factory Orders and Durable Goods revisions are due just after the US cash open and US President Trump’s State of Union address will be closely watched overnight (0200GMT).</p><p><strong>Yuan</strong></p><p>A complete reversal from yesterday’s price action and a total wipe-out of the prior session’s losses despite a firmer USD/CNY fixing by the PBoC overnight amid what seems to be a U-turn in sentiment. The CNY finished its domestic session sub-7.00 and with the session’s price action contained within its 100 and 200 DMAs at 7.0210 and 6.9889, similar trade is seen in the offshore. Some have pointed to China’s proactive measures to tackle the outbreak as a potential factor leading the turnaround.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie leads the gains among the G10 in the aftermath of the RBA’s rate decision which proved to be less dovish than some had expected. Rates were left unchanged and the statement largely a copy-and-paste job from the prior meeting, albeit the commentary surrounding the bushfires and coronavirus seemed appeasing – with the Bank stating that effects will “temporarily weigh on growth” and its “too early” to assess the long-lasting impact. AUD/USD was bolstered above 0.6700 on the decision and thereafter hovered just off intraday highs, with the current risk-tone also underpinning the currency. Note: today sees some AUD 1.2bln in options expiring at strike 0.6765 at the NY cut. Meanwhile, Kiwi gleans some support from the risk sentiment, but gains remain capped as the AUD/NZD cross eyes 1.0400 to the upside, having tested the level in earlier trade (vs. low 1.0350)</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling has seen a mild recovering following its earlier slide below the 1.3000 mark vs. the USD in a continuation of yesterday’s price action. Earlier in the session, Cable took out its overnight low (~1.2980) and the Jan low (1.2955) before printing a fresh 2020 low at 1.2942, with eyes on the Dec low (~1.2895) should the pair breach 1.2900. Cable recouped some losses and is testing 1.3000 to the upside at time of writing. Subsequently, EUR/GBP saw fleeting gains in which in the cross reached a high of 0.8537 (vs. low of 0.8495) ahead of the Jan 20th high of 0.8553. EUR/USD meanwhile remains flat in a tight intraday band of 1.1050-1.1065, with some ~EUR 1bln expiring around strike 1.1030-40.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Safe-haven FX conformed to the overall risk appetite with the JPY and CHF the G10 underperformers. USD/JPY just about reclaimed 109.00 to the upside in early trade (vs. low of ~108.60) ahead of its potential resistance at 109.30 (Jan 29th high). The Swiss Franc meanwhile eyes 0.9700 to the upside vs. the USD having printed a low of ~0.9660.&nbsp;</p>",

Disney, Ford, BP</li></ul><p>CORONAVIRUS UPDATE</p><p><strong>China National Health Commission said total confirmed cases of coronavirus now at 20438 and death toll at 425 </strong>vs. Prev. 17205 coronavirus cases and deaths at 361. There were also separate reports of the first coronavirus death for Hong Kong and that a South Korean woman tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US CDC confirmed 11 cases of coronavirus in the US and the second case of person-to-person transmission, while CDC noted it is preparing against the coronavirus as if it were the next pandemic</strong>. Furthermore, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease said the coronavirus is \"very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic\". (Newswires)</p><p>China Foreign Ministry said it hopes US provides aid it promised on the coronavirus outbreak soon, while it added the US should refrain from overreacting to the outbreak and work with China to deal with the epidemic. (Newswires)</p><p>Macau is considering suspending casino operations for at least half a month, although would need to discuss with sector and city to be able to afford the costs of such a move. (Newswires)</p><p>German Health Ministry announced the G7 health ministers agreed upon a coordinated approach regarding travel regulations, precautions and research into the coronavirus and cooperation with EU, WHO and China. (Newswires)</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asia-Pac equity markets traded higher after following suit to Wall St peers which were encouraged by China’s support measures and strong US data</strong>. The rebound extended into the region in which the <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%)</strong> recovered initial losses of more than 2.0% on aggressive bargain buying after having opened at its weakest in almost a year and following the 7.7% sell-off yesterday. The PBoC also continued to supply liquidity through CNY 500bln of reverse repos, while the <strong>Hang Seng (+0.8%)</strong> was lifted on the improved risk sentiment and after Q4 GDP showed a narrower than expected contraction which effectively overshadowed Hong Kong’s first coronavirus related death. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.4%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.4%)</strong> were kept afloat albeit with less conviction amid the RBA rate decision where the central bank kept rates unchanged and disappointed those anticipating a more dovish tone, while Tokyo sentiment contained by recent currency strength although firm gains were seen in Panasonic shares after it reported an increase in 9-month net and that its battery JV with Tesla turned profitable. Finally, 10yr JGBs and T-notes were subdued as the recovery in stocks sapped demand for safe havens which saw the former gap below the 153.00 level, with mixed 10yr JGB auction results also adding to the humdrum price action for JGBs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 380bln via 7-day and CNY 120bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 400bln. Furthermore, PBoC said liquidity injections show resolution to boost confidence and was to steer interbank rates lower, while it added the larger than expected injection is to lower loan rate. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 6.9779 vs. Exp. 6.9758 (Prev. 6.9249)</strong></p><p><strong>USTR said there was no formal request from China on purchase flexibility although observers suggested that President Trump could provide some leeway if the numbers are heading in the right direction</strong>, according to Politico. (Politico)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>ECB's Weidmann </strong>said a new inflation target should rid the perception that the ECB can control inflation to a tenth of a percent and noted ECB should simplify its inflation target but must avoid large increases to its goal. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>ECB's De Guindos</strong> believes we have to be very prudent regarding the coronavirus and noted we are currently in the first stage of this outbreak and does not believe there is a pervasive overvaluation of real estate in the euro zone at all. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was steady ahead of the results of the Democrat Iowa caucuses and held on to recent gains which were spurred by stronger than expected ISM data, as well as losses in its major counterparts including <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which languished near 1.1050 and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly below 1.3000 as it extended on recent losses. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> remained subdued below 109.00, while commodity-linked currencies were mostly lacklustre after the recent slump in oil and weaker CNY reference rate, although <strong>AUD</strong> was later boosted after the RBA policy announcement in which it kept rates unchanged as expected and reiterated the main lines from its statement which disappointed those anticipating a more dovish tone and subsequently saw pricing of a March cut halve to just 33%.</p><p><strong>RBA kept the Cash Rate unchanged at 0.75% as expected</strong>. RBA reiterated it will ease policy if needed to support sustainable growth and rates are to remain low for an extended period, while it added that low rates are boosting asset prices which should lead to increased spending and that it will monitor developments in labour market. RBA added that wage growth is expected to remain at current levels for some time and the central scenario remains for the Australia economy to grow 2.75% this year, 3.00% in 2021 and underlying inflation is to be close to 2% this year and next. Furthermore, <strong>RBA noted that bushfires and coronavirus will temporarily weigh on growth although it is too early to determine how long-lasting impact from coronavirus will be.</strong></p><p><strong>The US Trump administration it to proceed with new rules that would enable the nation to impose punitive tariffs on goods from countries believed to have undervalued currencies</strong>, according to the Commerce Department. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures found some reprieve from the recent selling which briefly saw prices slip to below USD 50/bbl, although oil has since nursed some of the losses with the rebound helped by the positive risk tone and with OPEC+ reportedly considering further oil output cuts of 500k BPD due to the virus outbreak. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was subdued after recent strength in the greenback, as well as the momentum in risk assets which was also the main driver for <strong>copper</strong> prices.</p><p><strong>Russian President and Saudi Crown Prince confirmed readiness to continue cooperation in OPEC+ format, according to Russian agencies citing the Kremlin</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>Libya's crude production reportedly fell to 204k BPD due to the continued blockade of its oil infrastructure, according to Argus Media citing sources. (Twitter)</p><p>Goldman Sachs said oil prices are now at levels where supply response from both OPEC and US shale producers point to only modest further downside potential, while it suggested recent sell-off, the oil market is pricing at least -0.44% impact to global GDP from the coronavirus. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>T-Notes traded choppy, paring back its losses made in the European session, with the 10-year yield floating modestly above the 1.50% figure at settlement. Although the US ISM Manufacturing report was stellar by all accounts for January, concerns linger as the coronavirus outbreak is yet to express itself in the data; Chinese officials have already warned of cuts to its growth figures. Furthermore, participants are unlikely to flood to risk in anticipation of the critical Iowa caucus - results due later Monday – which provides an initial indication of the footing of the Democratic candidates and thus the likelihood of their policies. By settlement, yields were little changed at the long-end, whilst the short-end rose: 2s30s -4bps, 2s10s -2bps, 2s5s -1bps. US T-note (H0) futures settled 2+ ticks lower at 131-18+.</p><p><strong>Democratic Iowa caucuses results were delayed due to quality checks amid inconsistencies and Iowa Democrats were said to be undecided if they will release caucus results on Monday night</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bostic (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said we are doing pretty good in meeting employment target although inflation remains weak and not where we would like it to be. Bostic added the Fed will taper pace of repo activity and balance sheet will still grow but slowly, while he added the Fed still views the balance sheet as a possible policy tool although the rate is the main tool. Furthermore, he stated that a material change to him would mean large numbers of businesses changing plans on investment or hiring and that he will start to adjust his outlook if there's a change in mindset for businesses.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets traded higher as they followed suit to their peers on Wall St which were encouraged by China’s support measures and strong US data. The rebound extended into the region in which the Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) recovered initial losses of more than 2.0% on aggressive bargain buying after having opened at its weakest in almost a year and following the 7.7% sell-off yesterday. The PBoC also continued to supply liquidity through CNY 500bln of reverse repos, while the Hang Seng (+0.8%) was lifted on the improved risk sentiment and after Q4 GDP showed a narrower than expected contraction which effectively overshadowed Hong Kong’s first coronavirus related death. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were kept afloat albeit with less conviction amid the RBA rate decision where the central bank kept rates unchanged and disappointed those anticipating a more dovish tone, while Tokyo sentiment contained by recent currency strength although firm gains were seen in Panasonic shares after it reported an increase in 9-month net and that its battery JV with Tesla turned profitable. Finally, 10yr JGBs and T-notes were subdued as the recovery in stocks sapped demand for safe havens which saw the former gap below the 153.00 level, with mixed 10yr JGB auction results also adding to the humdrum price action for JGBs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets are mostly higher as they take their cue from their peers on Wall St which were encouraged by China’s support measures and strong US data. This rebound has extended into the region with the Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) recovering initial losses of more than 2.0% on aggressive bargain buying after having opened at its weakest in almost a year and following the 7.7% sell-off yesterday. Furthermore, the PBoC continued to supply liquidity through CNY 500bln of reverse repos, while the Hang Seng (+0.6%) is also lifted on the improved risk sentiment and after Q4 GDP showed a narrower than expected contraction which have overshadowed Hong Kong’s first coronavirus related death. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) are kept afloat albeit with less conviction as Australia awaits today’s RBA rate decision and with Tokyo sentiment contained by recent currency strength, although firm gains are seen in Panasonic shares after it reported an increase in 9-month net and that its battery JV with Tesla turned profitable in Q4.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady ahead of the results of the Democrat Iowa caucuses and holds on to recent gains which were spurred by stronger than expected ISM data, as well as losses in its major counterparts including EUR/USD which languishes near 1.1050 and with GBP/USD below 1.3000 as it extends on post-Brexit losses. In addition, UK PM Johnson confirmed a hard line stance as expected in which he stated there is no need for a free trade agreement to involve the acceptance of EU rules and that Britain is prepared to walk away if a free trade agreement cannot be reached. Elsewhere, USD/JPY remains subdued firmly below 109.00, while commodity-linked currencies are lacklustre after the recent slump in oil and weaker CNY reference rate, with AUD also tentative ahead of the RBA policy announcement.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs and T-notes are both lower as the recovery in stocks sap demand for safe havens which saw the former gap below the 153.00 level, while participants also await the 10yr JGB auction results due later.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>IOWA CAUCUS:</strong></p><ul><li>The Iowa Caucus may set the tone for the rest of the Democrat's presidential nomination race. Observers note that over the last 11 Iowa Dem caucuses, there have only been two occasions where the winner did not secure the Democrat Presidential nomination.</li><li>A single candidate has not managed to secure a majority of support, according to an average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics; former VP Biden leads the field (polling at around 27% nationwide), followed by Sanders (around 24%), and then Warren (around 15%). For reference, in 2016, Sanders took 49.6% of the vote vs Hillary Clinton's 49.8%, suggesting he is a 'known' quantity which Iowans have warmed to in the past; Sanders also performed well in New Hampshire in 2016, the next key race for Dem candidates (11/Feb). Looking at an average of specific Iowa polls, Sanders is ahead at 24%, Biden follows at 20%, followed by Buttigieg at 16%; Warren is currently in fourth place, polling at under 15%, according to Real Clear Politics.</li><li>If Biden wins, analysts do not expect a negative reaction for risk since he is the 'establishment' choice, and additionally, equities rose during his tenure as VP. However, it will likely be negative for US risk assets if it confirms loss of front-runner status for Joe Biden. There are greater risks with Sanders and Warren, who have both advocated policies that entail higher taxes and regulations, and have targeted large tech companies and health care names, which could present risks for equities.</li></ul><p><strong>2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- MARKET SCENARIOS:</strong></p><ul><li>JPM thinks that the best-case scenario for markets is probably Democrat nominee front-runner, and former Vice President, Joe Biden winning the Democrat primaries, defeating Trump in November but facing a Republican Senate, since the bank believes his policy agenda is not particularly disruptive, and would be dead-on-arrival (at least with respect to tax policy) if Congress remains split. JPM thinks Biden's foreign policies would not entail China tariff rollback, but neither would it be so impulsive, which is why a Biden Presidency should result in lower volatility vs a Trump second second term.</li><li>JPM argues Trump's re-election would be the second-best case scenario, since the tax environment would be stable and the deregulation agenda would advance, but it warns that foreign policy could become even more aggressive under a President validated at the ballot box and acquitted during the impeachment process.</li><li>JPM says the worst-case scenarios are either Sanders/Warren Presidencies with full control of the House and Senate, given the implications for corporate taxes and regulatory policy. The second-worst would be a progressive President without control of the Senate, since the regulatory environment can still be influenced via agency appointments, court challenges and enforcement/interpretation of existing statutes, even without whole changes to legislation.</li><li>JPMorgan notes that 2020 is a unique election cycle, arguing that: (1) The incumbent (President Trump) has never been so unpopular (and therefore vulnerable) entering a re-election when the US unemployment rate is so low and the equity market so strong; (2) the Democrats have never fielded a slate of nominees with so many left-of-center contenders (Sanders, Warren), one of whom (Sanders) has narrowed the gap to a centrist in polls and overtaken him in the betting markets; and (3) never has the US Senate undertaken an impeachment trial during an election year, which raises questions about whether Republicans support for Trump could cost them the chamber in November (their majority is just three-seats currently).</li><li>A few factors to keep in mind: JPM says all these scenarios are in play, but it is worth remembering that polls usually carry an anti-incumbent bias that fades as the election approaches; polls carry a margin of error (around 3% when referring to a specific candidates support, and 6% referring to voting intentions); betting markets and polls signal different outcomes, though these markets tend to favour long-shot candidates. Finally, JPM notes that US Presidential elections are decided in 5-10 swing states which vote less consistently for Democrats (as coastal states do) or Republicans (as the West, Mid West and South tends to do). The combined upshot is that it is tough to have a high conviction view on the election's outcome</li><li>JPM says this uncertainty is one reason why it wanted to enter 2020 overweight non-US vs US Equities, but also short USD versus various currencies (high-yielders like MXN, RUB and INR in EM, and reserve currencies like CHF in G10). JPM says that favoring non-US Equities and high-yield currencies will not hedge a progressive lead in the Democratic primaries if the nCov crisis is flaring, but owning CHF (or JPY or Gold) should. \"If we are wrong that China can contain this virus and if the primaries surge to the left, there won’t be much point in discussing a few hedges,\" the bank writes, \"the potential drawdown would be so large that we would need to rethink the merits of a reflation trade for H1.\"</li></ul><p><strong>KEY UPCOMING US ELECTION CAMPAIGN DATES:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>3/Feb: Iowa Caucus</li><li>7/Feb: New Hampshire Debate</li><li>11/Feb: New Hampshire Primary</li><li>19/Feb: Democrat Debate</li><li>22/Feb: Nevada Caucus</li><li>25/Feb: Democrat Debate</li><li>03/Mar: Super Tuesday (16 Primary/Caucus events)</li><li>NOTE: regarding the terminology, a caucus is run by the party which will select candidates to support for the Presidential nomination based on a system of local gatherings; a primary is a state-wide vote by secret-ballot; the state determines if the vote is closed (only those registered with that party can vote) or open (unaffiliated voters can participate).</li><li>NOTE: While the GOP still has its own primaries and caucuses ahead of the 2020 Presidential Elections in November 2020, President Trump and Vice President Pence will be formally nominated at the August Republican National Convention (24-27th Aug).</li></ul>",
