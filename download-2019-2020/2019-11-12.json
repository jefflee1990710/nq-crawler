Furthermore, the report is said to be separate from the Commerce Department Section 232 report on tariffs on autos and auto parts and the President has until tomorrow to decide whether to act or to delay action on that report, according to Fox's Lawrence. However, there were conflicting reports that suggested US President Trump will put the EU auto tariffs on hold while he proceeds towards a China deal although it was not a rock solid certainty, according to people familiar with the matter. (Fox/Politico/Twitter)</p><p>US President Trump repeated familiar criticisms of the Fed and talked up his achievements on the economy since coming into office.

Harker also suggested that in the case of a recession the best response is not negative rates but larger fiscal stimulus and the first line of defense would be bringing rates to zero as well as asset purchases. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Major US Equity bourses reversed gains made on the open, which made fresh intra-day ATHs, after President Trump failed to provide meaningful updates (in his speech at the NY Econ Club) on key issues such as China and EU trade. There were earlier rumours that suggested the President was to announce a \"constructive\" update on the China front, although Trump ultimately provided no specifics, and largely reiterations, hitting hopes of details on the timing and location of the Phase One trade deal, and potential tariff roll backs. Trump also failed to clarify if he would be delaying a decision on EU auto tariffs; however, a risk off move was induced from reports that the USTR office was to submit new potential auto tariffs which Trump could implement on the EU. NEC Director Kudlow later spoke to Trump's aide, saying that when Trump says a deal is close, he means it is close - the comments did indeed find some support for Spoos. Disney (DIS) was firmer as it launched its new streaming service, Disney+. Tesla (TSLA) benefited from a positive mention at Morgan Stanley, which praised the potential from its approaching pickup truck launch. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) was firmer as it increased its dividend. Applied Materials (AMAT) opened higher after some PT rises ahead of its earnings on Thursday, but pared gains through the session. Nvidia (NVDA) benefitted from a PT rise to USD 250 from USD 190 at Oppenheimer, who expects beats on its earnings report on Thursday; Oppenheimer also boosted Crispr (CRSP) on an upgrade. Western Union (WU) and CSX (CSX) suffered from downgrades at Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank, respectively. Teva (TEVA) and Crowdstrike (CRWD) benefited from upgrades at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, respectively.

Meanwhile, AbbVie (ABBV) gained the title of the year’s largest issuer after its USD 30bln M&amp;A bond for its acquisition of Allergan (AGN).

There were earlier rumours that suggested the President was to announce a \"constructive\" update on the China front, although Trump ultimately provided no specifics, and largely reiterations, hitting hopes of details on the timing and location of the Phase One trade deal, and potential tariff roll backs. Trump also failed to clarify if he would be delaying a decision on EU auto tariffs; however, a risk off move was induced from reports that the USTR office was to submit new potential auto tariffs which Trump could implement on the EU. NEC Director Kudlow later spoke to Trump's aide, saying that when Trump says a deal is close, he means it is close - the comments did indeed find some support for Spoos. Elsewhere it was a relatively quiet day despite the US holiday return. Fed speak was uneventful, especially now that the Fed is on pause, a sentiment echoed by the latest BofAML FMS which showed monetary risk concerns near record low for participants and expectations for the Fed to stand put until 2020-end; Powell's address tomorrow is unlikely to cause a stir. Treasuries settled marginally firmer in a thin ranged day, although the big story in the debt complex is ABBV's USD 30bln M&amp;A Bond, the largest issuance of the year so far. Dollar was firmer slightly, helped on the Euro cross by ECB VP De Guindos suggesting the ECB has plenty more ammo to give, shrugging off the better than expected German ZEW survey; XAU and JPY found some support into session-end. Crude reversed earlier gains to end in the red as a lack of progressive trade updates weighed on demand concerns.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP: </strong>US<strong> </strong>President Trump reiterated that the US was close to signing a Phase One trade deal with China, which could happen soon, but only if it was at a benefit to the US, he said in his remarks at the New York Economic Club. Trump failed to provider any specific details on when/where a signing could happen, nor if tariffs would be rolled back or not, but did say they would be increased if a deal is not signed. China as a currency manipulator and a cheat since its joining of the WTO, were criticisms he reiterated too. Trump didn’t clarify whether or not he would be delaying the EU auto tariff decision either (overnight sources suggested that he would to focus on China trade), although he did criticise the EU for having “terrible trade barriers” (which saw some additional Euro selling). Prior to the address, FBN’s Edward Lawrence reported that the USTR office would submit a report on possible tariffs on autos and auto parts, which will be submitted to White House by Wednesday, and could allow Trump to target specific countries and the EU for auto-tariffs. Lawrence caveated that the USTR's report is separate from the Commerce Department’s Section 232 report on tariffs on autos and auto parts, \"The President has until tomorrow to decide to delay action on that report... or act on it.\" Trump spent the time in his speech to call for passage on the USMCA, too, saying that most democrats would vote for it if they could today. The President also said the US has the ability to lower taxes further and further its deregulation. On the Federal Reserve, Trump again criticized it for putting a cap on US stock market performance and placing the US in a competitive disadvantage, calling on the central bank to set its rates negatively such as the ECB has.</p><p><strong>* KUDLOW: </strong>NEC Director Kudlow spoke after the President’s speech noting that neither China or the US is going to agree to tariff adjustments until a deal is reached, but did note that it is a possibility that adjustments to tariffs could be apart of the deal. Kudlow largely reiterated Trump’s comments on a timeline for a phase one deal, saying “close” means “close; but he would not put a timeframe for the deal. The US have previously stated they would be abiding by the APEC summit timeline, which was initially scheduled for this week before cancellation. Kudlow reiterated the two sides have made progress on IP theft, financial services, currency stability, commodities and agriculture. On the Fed, Kudlow in response to Trump’s desire for negative rates stated he does not think the US needs negative rates right now as the economy is in a good place, suggesting Trump’s comments were to get across a point of a need for easing; Kudlow also highlighted yield curve normalisation as a good thing. On tax cuts, Kudlow has been asked by Trump to work on tax reform 2.0, however it is in early stages and thus too early to provide any details. The announcement coincided with a WaPo report stating economic advisers are considering whether to campaign on a 15% tax rate proposal for middle class income earners.</p><p><strong>* US NFIB SURVEY (OCT</strong>.): Sentiment among small businesses rose to 102.4 (consensus 102.0) from a previous 101.80. Pantheon Macroeconomics has noted that the NFIB index remains soft, seeing its peak of 105.0 in May, just before tariffs on the import of some Chinese goods was boosted by 25% from 10%. \"Marginal increases in most of the sentiment and activity numbers lifted the October headline, with the notable exception of a five-point drop in the earnings expectation measure, to a seven-month low of -8,\" Pantheon writes, \"this came out of the blue, and we suspect it reflects fears that retailers will not be able to pass on to consumers the 15% tariffs on an array of imported Chinese consumer goods, imposed on 1st September.\". It also noted that selling prices rose by two points, but are contained within the range suggesting that firms are expecting a margin squeeze. On a more positive note, Pantheon points out that capex intentions rose by two points, taking it to a five-month high. \"The index is down three points on a Y/Y basis, signalling downward pressure on business capex into next spring - the index leads by a couple of quarters - but base effects become favorable at the turn of the year, so the capex rollover ought not to last beyond mid-2020,\" adding that \"this assumes no further intensification of the trade war, which seems a reasonable assumption at this point.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Harker, who return to vote in 2020, said he was against the October rate cut, advocating for the Fed to hold rates steady and see how the economy evolves. The Philly Fed President said that by lowering rates further, the effect would not be as expected, citing that businesses are not citing the cost of capital as a headwind. Harker said current monetary policy was about neutral or slightly accommodative, negative rates are not something he is considering and that discussions at the Fed for a standing repo facility are ongoing. Vice Chair Clarida provided little comments in regard to near-term policy, or his view on the outlook, but said there are ongoing discussions about “makeup” inflation strategies that could aid anchored inflation expectations and support the economy should rates fall to zero. Fed’s Barkin, who is a non-voter, echoed Harker, saying policy was mildly accommodative following the recent cuts and that he doesn’t see rate cuts as having a big effect on investment, which he believes is being shadowed by the negative climate for business, trade uncertainty, regulation and geopolitics. Fed speak is very much in the back seat post the October rate cut and its signalling that it would be standing put; the latest BofAML FMS shows that investor concern on monetary risk are near record lows and expect rates to remain at a standstill through till the election.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Ahead of US President Trump’s and Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting on Wednesday, WSJ reported that US military officials watched live drone feeds last month which showed Turkish-backed Arab gunmen targeting civilians during their assault on Kurdish fighters in NE Syria, according to US officials familiar with the matter. In Hong Kong, Nikkei reported that due to concerns of capital outflows becoming “exodus”, Hong Kong Authorities are reportedly offering private banks an offices incentive to stay in the region, which could potentially include tax cuts. The violence continued today where police were reportedly firing tear gas at a city university campus at protestors. Over in Israel, its Iron Dome reportedly intercepted a rocket barrage, as sirens and multiple explosions were heard. This followed reports that Israel struck the house of the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed wing in Gaza, while reports also note a residential building was hit during Israeli airstrikes in Damascus, stated ELINT News.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.06 LOWER AT USD 56.80/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.12 LOWER AT USD 62.06/BBL</strong>. Crude markets were choppy, buffeted by mixed trade headlines that also whipsawed the equity market, but ultimately finished the session in the red. Front month WTI and Brent futures found support just ahead of USD 56.60/bbl and USD 61.90/bbl levels, coinciding with yesterday evening’s lows, before eventually giving way into settlement. In news flow; in fitting with recent commentary and source reports, the WSJ, citing OPEC delegates, reported that OPEC are to maintain oil production curbs through the next year. A Gulf OPEC delegate noted that there is a risk that if prices rise due to OPEC cutting deeper, then US companies could hike production to bring it back down. \"OPEC would ensure that won’t happen\" the delegate said. TC Energy is reportedly using drag reducing agents to support flow in the Keystone pipeline following the spillage which has seen a widening of the WCS/WTI Arb in recent weeks. Note that both the API and EIA US energy inventory reports will be delayed by one day due to Veterans Day in the US on Monday, however, current expectations see crude stocks building by 1.6mln bbls (a third consecutive week of builds), gasoline drawing 1.1mln bbls and distillates drawing 0.8mln bbls; Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks drawing 1.2mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 128-17: </strong>The<strong> </strong>TPLEX traded choppy and rangebound on Tuesday where Trump’s anticipated speech failed to provide key details on the trade fronts with both China and the EU. Meanwhile, AbbVie (ABBV) gained the title of the year’s largest issuer after its USD 30bln M&amp;A bond for its acquisition of Allergan (AGN). Yields were little changed at settlement with the 2s10s still gravitating around 26bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.2% at 3092, NASDAQ-100 0.3% at 8264, Dow Jones 0% at 27692,</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.1%, Consumer Staples 0.2%, Energy -0.6%, Financials 0%, Health Care 0.6%, Industrials 0%, Information Technology 0.3%, Materials 0.4%, Telecommunication Services 0.3%, Utilities 0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Disney (DIS) was firmer as it launched its new streaming service, Disney+. Tesla (TSLA) benefited from a positive mention at Morgan Stanley, which praised the potential from its approaching pickup truck launch. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) was firmer as it increased its dividend. Applied Materials (AMAT) opened higher after some PT rises ahead of its earnings on Thursday, but pared gains through the session. Nvidia (NVDA) benefitted from a PT rise to USD 250 from USD 190 at Oppenheimer, who expects beats on its earnings report on Thursday; Oppenheimer also boosted Crispr (CRSP) on an upgrade. Western Union (WU) and CSX (CSX) suffered from downgrades at Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank, respectively. Teva (TEVA) and Crowdstrike (CRWD) benefited from upgrades at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, respectively.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Rockwell Automation (ROK) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates and strong guidance for 2020. D.R. Horton (DHI) supported homebuilders after a stellar report and guidance. Tyson Foods (TSN) disappointed on top and bottom line estimates, but an increase in dividend with some optimistic guidance saw the share outperform. DXC Technologies (DXC) had a car wreck of a report, missing estimates for both the quarter and guidance, but legged higher on the open as it announced it would be divesting three of its businesses. Linde PLC (LIN) outperformed after an EPS beat and raising its FY EPS view. CBS (CBS) traded in the red on a revenue miss; it expects the Viacom (VIAB) merger to close in early December. Tencent Music (TME) shares were hit amid a declining rate of growth in a key unit.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> USD traded marginally firmer today as it remained in yet again tight ranges, from 98.173 at the lows to highs of 98.423 with President Trump’s speech providing little direction to the buck as any further details on the US/China front were slim, despite earlier anticipation from sources. EUR traded weaker today amid dovish commentary from ECB’s De Guindos who noted the ECB has definitely not exhausted all of its options, adding inflation expectations have recently seen a marked decline but are yet to become de-anchored. The single currency shrugged off this morning’s German ZEW Economic Sentiment data which posted a 2.1-point decline, a much narrower decline than the expected 13-point fall. EURUSD found support around the 1.10 handle seeing lows of 1.1003 as it fell from highs just shy of 1.1040. Havens, were slightly bid heading into the Asia-Pac session, despite initial weakness on anticipation of constructive US China updates. The speech seemingly disappointing investors as havens caught a bid once the speech had finished pushing USDJPY beneath the 200 dma at 109.01 to push the cross to lows of 108.94, before paring back to the 200 dma. XAU initially traded lower hitting the 38.2% fib retracement level at 1446.04, which coincided with lows in the contract before paring back and ending the day marginally higher as havens caught a late wind bid, seeing highs at 1460. NZD traded on the backfoot on Tuesday ahead of tonight’s OCR decision from the RBNZ, where expectations for a cut jumped to 80% from 60% following soft 2-year inflation expectations, resulting in Westpac reverting to its prior forecast for a cut. EMFX was weaker across the board today with weakness in LATAM currencies led by Chile as protests and a general strike trickled through to other EM economies. USDCLP fell over 5% briefly breaching 800.00 to the upside as the Government conceded to demand for constitutional change whilst liquidity dried up ahead of the banks early close. MXN also saw some weakness prior to Trump’s key speech as some speculated a tough announcement on the USMCA, albeit the President did not follow through.</p>",

In news flow; in fitting with recent commentary and source reports, the WSJ, citing OPEC delegates, reported that OPEC are to maintain oil production curbs through the next year. A Gulf OPEC delegate noted that there is a risk that if prices rise due to OPEC cutting deeper, then US companies could hike production to bring it back down. \"OPEC would ensure that won’t happen\" the delegate said. TC Energy is reportedly using drag reducing agents to support flow in the Keystone pipeline following the spillage which has seen a widening of the WCS/WTI Arb in recent weeks. Note that both the API and EIA US energy inventory reports will be delayed by one day due to Veterans Day in the US on Monday, however, current expectations see crude stocks building by 1.6mln bbls (a third consecutive week of builds), gasoline drawing 1.1mln bbls and distillates drawing 0.8mln bbls; Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks drawing 1.2mln bbls.</li></ul>",

Although equity markets did not move higher at the time of his initial tweet, the SPX made fresh ATHs around the 3100 mark shortly after the cash open; investors are seemingly optimistic that Trump's remarks will contain good news.</li></ul>",

Indeed, the Greenback is broadly firmer amidst rebounding Treasury yields and no further curve re-flattening, while gains vs certain G10 counterparts and EM currencies have been exacerbated by external factors.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is on the back foot ahead of the overnight RBNZ rate decision and post-policy meeting press conference from Governor Orr given heightened OCR easing expectations in wake of softer NZ inflation expectations, and typified by Westpac reverting to the consensus for 0.75% from 1% having switched to unchanged in November not that long ago. Nzd/Usd is holding just above 0.6325 with options pricing in a 45 pip break-even on the impending event that is previewed on the Ransquawk website in the Research Suite.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/CHF/JPY/GBP</strong></p><p>Unable to resist the Buck’s advances, with the Aussie also undermined by Kiwi contagion as the Aud/Nzd cross remained capped around 1.0800 and Aud/Usd rooted to multi-week lows not far above 0.6830. Meanwhile, the single currency has drifted closer towards 1.1000 after somewhat dovish commentary from ECB’s de Guindos and largely shrugging off an upbeat ZEW survey in terms of German sentiment and pan-Eurozone expectations. Elsewhere, the Pound, Yen, Franc and Loonie remained relatively rangebound, albeit with Usd/Chf and Usd/Cad marginally extending top and bottom respectively, as the latter tracked fluctuating crude prices.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi Kronas overcame early weakness and underperformance as overall risk sentiment/appetite improved, and with Eur/Nok retreating when 10.1000 held after a test on slightly softer than expected Q3 Norwegian GDP coupled with a contraction in September.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some respite for the likes of the Rand and Lira, but pre-Q3 Russian GDP data jitters hit the Rouble ahead of Wednesday’s release and a run on the Chilean Peso amidst more protests and general strike rippled through to other Latam currencies such as the Brazilian Real, Mexican and Argentinian Pesos. Note, Usd/Clp surged over 800 at one stage as the Government conceded to demand for constitutional change and liquidity dried up ahead of the early close of local banks.</p>",

(ELINT News</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities eke modest gains in early trade [Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%] </strong>following on from a relatively indecisive APAC session. Major bourses are buoyed amid expectations that US President Trump will delay the decision to impose tariffs on EU autos by six months, according to Politico citing sources, although upside is hampered amid US-China trade uncertainty and continuing social unrest in Hong Kong with its financial district paralysed with protests. Further upside was also generated after the better than expected German ZEW metrics. Sectors are mostly in the green with underperformance seen in Consumer Staples; Tesco (-1.3%) shares weighed on after Kantar showed a decline in the supermarket’s sales for the 12 weeks to November 3rd, whilst sector heavyweight Nestle (-0.2%) is also subdued after Unilever (+0.3%) was chosen by Burger King to supply plant-based burgers, passing over Nestle, Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. Elsewhere, most European auto names are cushioned on the back of the aforementioned Politico article; Daimler (+1.0%), Fiat Chrysler (+1.5%) and Peugeot (+1.5%) are all in the green, albeit Renault (Unch) fails to benefit after its alliance partner Nissan reported a 70% Q2 profit slump and slashed its FY sales and operating profit due to weaker demand. Tyre names are broadly lower as dismal earnings from Continental (-1.4%) overshadowed the Politico autos story, with Michelin (+0.3%) initially lower in sympathy, whilst Pirelli (+1.0%) awaits its earnings release scheduled for later today. Meanwhile, Airbus (+1.0%) shares seem to be lifted via a Boeing tailwind, whose shares closed higher in excess of 4% after a spokesperson said 737Max deliveries could resume in December; however, FAA approval is not expected until January 2020. Looking at other movers, Illiad (+17.5%) soared to the top of the pan-European index at the open after the Co. announced a EUR 1.4bln share buyback programme at EUR 120/shr, vs. a sub EUR 100/shr Monday close. Finally, Infineon (+7.5%), Dialog Semiconductor (+6.5%) and Deutsche Post (+4.5%) shares remain firm at the top of the Stoxx 600 index post-earnings.</p><p><strong>US President Trump is reportedly expected to delay the EU auto tariff decision for another 6 months. (Politico)</strong></p><p>FX</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD -</strong> Not quite all change, but a marked turnaround in fortunes and sentiment for the Kiwi following a dip in NZ inflation expectations on the eve of the RBNZ policy meeting that has lifted 25 bp rate cut expectations to just over 80% from around 60% ahead of the survey and prompted Westpac to reinstate its call for an ease this month after the bank switched to unchanged. Nzd/Usd has slipped further below 0.6350 in response and Aud/Nzd is back up near 1.0800 even though the Aussie has fallen in sympathy to fresh 2 week lows vs its US counterpart around 0.6835 amidst expectations that the RBA will implement QE by the end of 2020, per JPM.</p><p><strong>NOK -</strong> The Norwegian Krona is marginally underperforming relative to its Scandinavian peer and in Euro cross terms in wake of GDP data showing softer than forecast Q3 growth and consecutive m/m contractions, with Eur/Nok nudging towards 10.1000 vs Eur/Sek holding steady circa 10.7000.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD/GBP/CHF -</strong> All softer against the Greenback, albeit to varying degrees as the DXY derives some support from steadier UST yields and a broadly unchanged curve in contrast to Monday’s bullish retracement and re-flattening. The index is straddling 98.250, with Eur/Usd, Usd/Jpy, Usd/Cad, Cable and Usd/Chf meandering between 1.1020-38, 109.30-00, 1.3255-25, 1.2866-16 and 0.9953-30 respectively. The single currency appears supported ahead of 1.2 bn option expiries at the 1.1000 strike, but capped well in advance of 1.6 bn that roll off between 1.1075-85, and somewhat strangely unimpressed with significantly better than anticipated ZEW economic sentiment and expectations for Germany and the Eurozone as a whole. Conversely, Sterling did derive a bit of traction from elements of the UK labour report, like a dip in the jobless rate and ‘only’ 58k drop in employment vs -94k or more consensus that compensated for claimant count and wage misses.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Rand has rebounded from yesterday’s 14.9600+ lows even though SA’s Eskom is still experiencing problems, but the Lira has not really gleaned much comfort from Turkey’s record current account surplus given ongoing jitters about the outcome of Wednesday’s meeting between US President Trump and Erdogan. Elsewhere, the offshore Yuan is hovering around 7.0000 awaiting Trump’s address on Trade and Economic Policy that may contain something constructive on the status of talks with China (perhaps more on Phase 1?).</p><p>New Zealand RBNZ 2yr Inflation Expectations (Q4) 1.80% (Prev. 1.86%).

However, the 10 year benchmark has now faded just ahead of 131.00 as its German/Eurozone peer sits 20 ticks above the 169.26 Eurex low, but still sub-par in keeping with <strong>US Treasuries</strong> ahead of the return of cash traders from their long holiday weekend and what could be a key/pivotal address from President Trump at the NY Economic Club, although Fed’s Barkin and Harker may vie for attention.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Crude markets are higher on Tuesday morning</strong>, as the complex continues to consolidate within recent ranges amid a lack of fresh fundamental drivers. For now, <strong>WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 futures</strong> are rangebound around the USD 57.00/bbl and USD 62.50/bbl marks respectively. Comments yesterday from Oman’s Oil Minister, who said deeper OPEC+ cuts at next month’s meeting are unlikely, served as further evidence that there is a lack of willingness among OPEC+ to take stronger action to support crude prices. Recent reports alleged that the Saudis will push for production cuts, but only via seeking better compliance rather than deeper output cuts. Analysts at Morgan Stanley argue that without firmer intervention, a new supply glut could send the market lower early next year by around 30%, which would see Brent trading at roughly USD 45/bbl. In terms of fresh drivers, the market will be eyeing a US President Trump speech at the Economic Club of New York this afternoon and a slate of Fed/ECB speak throughout the day. Participants will have to wait one day longer than usual for the weekly API Inventory data release and the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook, which have both been delayed on account of yesterday’s US Veteran’s Day holiday. Similarly, Wednesday’s usual EIA Inventory data release will be pushed back to 16:00 GMT Thursday. In terms of metals; <strong>Gold</strong> prices are marginally softer and tentative ahead of President Trump’s speech. Elsewhere, <strong>Dalian Iron Ore</strong> prices were sent higher during overnight trade on the news of an outlook cut from Vale, which implies a decline in sales of at least 14.7% in 2019. Copper, meanwhile, fell as EU players arrived at their desks, breaking through resistance at the USD 2.6500/lbs level to a low of around 2.6425/lb.</p>",

Major bourses are buoyed amid expectations that US President Trump will delay the decision to impose tariffs on EU autos by six months, according to Politico citing sources, although upside is hampered amid US-China trade uncertainty and continuing social unrest in Hong Kong with its financial district paralysed with protests. Further upside was also generated after the better than expected German ZEW metrics. Sectors are mostly in the green with underperformance seen in Consumer Staples; Tesco (-1.3%) shares weighed on after Kantar showed a decline in the supermarket’s sales for the 12 weeks to November 3rd, whilst sector heavyweight Nestle (-0.2%) is also subdued after Unilever (+0.3%) was chosen by Burger King to supply plant-based burgers, passing over Nestle, Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. Elsewhere, most European auto names are cushioned on the back of the aforementioned Politico article; Daimler (+1.0%), Fiat Chrysler (+1.5%) and Peugeot (+1.5%) are all in the green, albeit Renault (Unch) fails to benefit after its alliance partner Nissan reported a 70% Q2 profit slump and slashed its FY sales and operating profit due to weaker demand. Tyre names are broadly lower as dismal earnings from Continental (-1.4%) overshadowed the Politico autos story, with Michelin (+0.3%) initially lower in sympathy, whilst Pirelli (+1.0%) awaits its earnings release scheduled for later today. Meanwhile, Airbus (+1.0%) shares seem to be lifted via a Boeing tailwind, whose shares closed higher in excess of 4% after a spokesperson said 737Max deliveries could resume in December; however, FAA approval is not expected until January 2020. Looking at other movers, Illiad (+17.5%) soared to the top of the pan-European index at the open after the Co. announced a EUR 1.4bln share buyback programme at EUR 120/shr, vs. a sub EUR 100/shr Monday close. Finally, Infineon (+7.5%), Dialog Semiconductor (+6.5%) and Deutsche Post (+4.5%) shares remain firm at the top of the Stoxx 600 index post-earnings.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - Not quite all change, but a marked turnaround in fortunes and sentiment for the Kiwi following a dip in NZ inflation expectations on the eve of the RBNZ policy meeting that has lifted 25 bp rate cut expectations to just over 80% from around 60% ahead of the survey and prompted Westpac to reinstate its call for an ease this month after the bank switched to unchanged. Nzd/Usd has slipped further below 0.6350 in response and Aud/Nzd is back up near 1.0800 even though the Aussie has fallen in sympathy to fresh 2 week lows vs its US counterpart around 0.6835 amidst expectations that the RBA will implement QE by the end of 2020, per JPM.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong> - The Norwegian Krona is marginally underperforming relative to its Scandinavian peer and in Euro cross terms in wake of GDP data showing softer than forecast Q3 growth and consecutive m/m contractions, with Eur/Nok nudging towards 10.1000 vs Eur/Sek holding steady circa 10.7000.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD/GBP/CHF</strong> - All softer against the Greenback, albeit to varying degrees as the DXY derives some support from steadier UST yields and a broadly unchanged curve in contrast to Monday’s bullish retracement and re-flattening. The index is straddling 98.250, with Eur/Usd, Usd/Jpy, Usd/Cad, Cable and Usd/Chf meandering between 1.1020-38, 109.30-00, 1.3255-25, 1.2866-16 and 0.9953-30 respectively. The single currency appears supported ahead of 1.2 bn option expiries at the 1.1000 strike, but capped well in advance of 1.6 bn that roll off between 1.1075-85, and somewhat strangely unimpressed with significantly better than anticipated ZEW economic sentiment and expectations for Germany and the Eurozone as a whole. Conversely, Sterling did derive a bit of traction from elements of the UK labour report, like a dip in the jobless rate and ‘only’ 58k drop in employment vs -94k or more consensus that compensated for claimant count and wage misses.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Rand has rebounded from yesterday’s 14.9600+ lows even though SA’s Eskom is still experiencing problems, but the Lira has not really gleaned much comfort from Turkey’s record current account surplus given ongoing jitters about the outcome of Wednesday’s meeting between US President Trump and Erdogan. Elsewhere, the offshore Yuan is hovering around 7.0000 awaiting Trump’s address on Trade and Economic Policy that may contain something constructive on the status of talks with China (perhaps more on Phase 1?).</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have emerged from their bouts of weakness and underperformance relative to <strong>Bunds</strong> in wake of the mixed UK jobs/wage data and a pre-Liffe open upgrade to the DMO’s remit for the current fiscal year with enough gusto to close the gap and post a net gain on the day of 11 ticks vs a 36 tick deficit at one stage. However, the 10 year benchmark has now faded just ahead of 131.00 as its German/Eurozone peer sits 20 ticks above the 169.26 Eurex low, but still sub-par in keeping with <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> ahead of the return of cash traders from their long holiday weekend and what could be a key/pivotal address from President Trump at the NY Economic Club, although Fed’s Barkin and Harker may vie for attention.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude markets are higher on Tuesday morning, as the complex continues to consolidate within recent ranges amid a lack of fresh fundamental drivers. For now, <strong>WTI</strong> Dec’ 19 and <strong>Brent</strong> Jan’ 19 futures are rangebound around the USD 57.00/bbl and USD 62.50/bbl marks respectively. Comments yesterday from Oman’s Oil Minister, who said deeper OPEC+ cuts at next month’s meeting are unlikely, served as further evidence that there is a lack of willingness among OPEC+ to take stronger action to support crude prices. Recent reports alleged that the Saudis will push for production cuts, but only via seeking better compliance rather than deeper output cuts. Analysts at Morgan Stanley argue that without firmer intervention, a new supply glut could send the market lower early next year by around 30%, which would see <strong>Brent</strong> trading at roughly USD 45/bbl. In terms of fresh drivers, the market will be eyeing a US President Trump speech at the Economic Club of New York this afternoon and a slate of Fed/ECB speak throughout the day. Participants will have to wait one day longer than usual for <strong>the weekly API Inventory data release and the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook, which have both been delayed on account of yesterday’s US Veteran’s Day holiday.</strong> Similarly, Wednesday’s usual EIA Inventory data release will be pushed back to 16:00 GMT Thursday. In terms of metals; <strong>Gold</strong> prices are marginally softer and tentative ahead of President Trump’s speech. Elsewhere, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>Iron</strong> <strong>Ore</strong> prices were sent higher during overnight trade on the news of an outlook cut from Vale, which implies a decline in sales of at least 14.7% in 2019. <strong>Copper</strong>, meanwhile, fell as EU players arrived at their desks, breaking through resistance at the USD 2.6500/lbs level to a low of around 2.6425/lb.</p>",

Furthermore, Tice added it was more likely that he and Farage would change their minds and reverse the decision not to run in Tory seats rather than pull out of more constituencies, according to ITV's Peston. (Twitter/ITV)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was slightly firmer and attempted to pick itself up from the pullback seen in the prior session, where it had fallen through its 50DMA at 98.29 amid gains in its European counterparts and with lighter volumes due to the quasi-holiday in US. Nonetheless, the greenback recovered some lost ground as <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated overnight and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> flat but well off yesterday’s best levels where it briefly tested 1.2900 to the upside after the Brexit Party announced it will not contest Tory seats in an effort to keep the pro-Brexit vote undivided and avert a hung parliament. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were mixed in light of the indecisive risk tone, while antipodeans were subdued by a weaker <strong>CNY</strong> reference rate, as well as further dovish policy calls in which JPMorgan now expect the RBA to instigate QE by the end of next year. Meanwhile, the losses in <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> were exacerbated on softer Inflation Expectations which subsequently led to a jump in the market pricing of a cut at tomorrow’s RBNZ meeting to nearly 80% from around 60% yesterday and spurred Westpac to revert to its recently dropped forecast for a cut at the looming announcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>New Zealand RBNZ 2yr Inflation Expectations (Q4) 1.80% (Prev. 1.86%).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices remained subdued following its recent breakdown attempt of the USD 1450/oz level with the precious metal restricted by a mild resurgence in the greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> nursed some of its recent losses amid early strength in Chinese commodity prices but with the rebound marginalized by the widespread indecision.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>Israel announced it struck the house of the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed wing in Gaza, while a residential building was also said to be hit during Israeli airstrikes in Damascus.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade relatively rangebound following a similar indecisive lead from Wall St where there was mild downside bias amid ongoing trade uncertainty, escalating Hong Kong violence and with volumes light due to Veterans Day. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) are mixed with Australia dragged by underperformance in the mining related sectors and with financials subdued after mixed results from the nation’s largest lender CBA, while the Japanese benchmark just about remains afloat with a mixed currency the main catalyst for price action. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are lacklustre after weaker than expected Chinese financing data and with the efforts to recoup some of the prior day’s hefty losses in Hong Kong, thwarted by resistance around the 27000 level and continued unrest in the city.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer and attempts to pick itself up from the pullback seen in the prior session, where it had fallen through its 50DMA at 98.29 amid gains in its European counterparts and with lighter volumes due to the quasi-holiday in US. Nonetheless, the greenback has recovered some lost ground as EUR/USD consolidates overnight and with GBP/USD flat but well off yesterday’s best levels where it briefly tested 1.2900 to the upside after the Brexit Party announced it will not contest Tory seats in an effort to keep the pro-Brexit vote undivided and avert a hung parliament. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed in light of the indecisive risk tone, while antipodeans underperform with NZD/USD leading the declines on softer Inflation Expectations and with AUD/USD dampened by a weaker CNY reference rate, as well as further dovish policy calls in which JPMorgan now expect the RBA to instigate QE by the end of next year.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued and have slipped below the 153.00 level after a lacklustre tone seen in Treasury futures which was hampered by the US bond market closure for Veteran’s Day, while the demand for JGBs is also restricted by a lack of buying from the BoJ with the central bank only in the market today for Treasury Discount Bills.</p>",
