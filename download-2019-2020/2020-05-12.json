Downside was extended once again in late trade with little new newsflow. Treasuries are bull-flattening amid conflicting signals on risk; the Treasury sold 10-year notes in a record sized offering, and demand is certainly clear even at these low yield levels, with the auction stopping through the screens and seeing decent internals. Oil picked up on further supply side supportive factors, while gold continues to consolidate around USD 1700. In Fedspeak, officials have generally pushed back against the notion of negative rates, and attention will be on Fed Chair Powell’s remarks due on Wednesday morning. CPI data missed to the downside, in another sign that the macro data is grim; while this won’t change the narrative at this moment in time, these data will be eyed more closely in the coming months to see how reopenings are affecting the data. Stimulus headlines have had a muted impact, as Democrats in the House present a USD 3trln Bill, including more direct payments to Americans, USD 1trln support for states and local government, and USD 75bln for testing and tracing; the Republicans have heavily leaned back against the package, suggesting it would not clear the Senate. Uber UBER) reportedly approached GrubHub (GRUB) with a takeover offer, according to sources, which note UBER proposed an all-stock merger and the two continue to discuss a potential tie-up. GRUB is said to seek 2.15 UBER shares for each GRUB share, although UBER said to only offer 2 shares. Boeing Company (BA) CEO expects passenger traffic will not return to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels by September, but perhaps towards 50% by the end of the year. However, CEO Calhoun does not expect traffic to return to normal for three years. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Musk tweeted that Tesla is restarting production against Alameda County rules with himself working alongside the employees. The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is reportedly accepting hotel reservations on its site from July 1st, according to Travel Weekly. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has been suggested by Elliott Advisors to explore a sale. Hyatt (H) announced it is to lay off up to 1300 workers and cut pay for senior management, board members, and employees in its restructuring move. SPX -2.1% at, NDQ -2% at 9112, DJIA -1.9% at 23,765.</p><p>The TPLEX traded firmer on Tuesday amid the duration bazooka Treasury supply, lacklustre risk appetite, and China risk. Treasuries had been richening ahead of the record size 10-year auction, supported by a 0.8% M/M decline in April CPI, in addition to equity downside as US futures struggled to break key resistance levels after the cash open. The USD 32bln 10-year auction stopped through the 0.712% WI by 1.2bps, covered 2.69x (vs average 2.46x), while dealers took just 20.52% (vs average 26.3%) – a successful all-round auction amid the new record refunding. Note that concession for the auction may have already taken place in prior sessions, in which the 10-year yield had risen from lows of 61bps on Friday to 70bps at the time of today’s auction. The Fed’s activeness in the market may have also limited pushing yields much further, despite the 30-year auction on Wednesday and the continued deluge of corporate deals; not to mention the new 20-year maturity arriving next week. Post the auction, duration continued to catch a bid after reports that GOP Senators had introduced new China sanctions legislation due to its treatment of Uighur Muslims. By settlement, the curve had firmly bull flattened. US T-note futures (M0) settled 10+ ticks higher at 138-30+.</p>",

Supply: </strong>US, UK, GE, IT</li></ul><h2><strong>MARKET WRAP</strong></h2><p>It has been another indecisive session, and stocks are trading with a negative bias due to US/China headlines, giving up earlier gains. Downside was extended once again in late trade with little new newsflow. Treasuries are bull-flattening amid conflicting signals on risk; the Treasury sold 10-year notes in a record sized offering, and demand is certainly clear even at these low yield levels, with the auction stopping through the screens and seeing decent internals. Oil picked up on further supply side supportive factors, while gold continues to consolidate around USD 1700. In Fedspeak, officials have generally pushed back against the notion of negative rates, and attention will be on Fed Chair Powell’s remarks due on Wednesday morning. CPI data missed to the downside, in another sign that the macro data is grim; while this won’t change the narrative at this moment in time, these data will be eyed more closely in the coming months to see how reopenings are affecting the data. Stimulus headlines have had a muted impact, as Democrats in the House present a USD 3trln Bill, including more direct payments to Americans, USD 1trln support for states and local government, and USD 75bln for testing and tracing; the Republicans have heavily leaned back against the package, suggesting it would not clear the Senate.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> Overnight, Fox reported US President Trump wants pension fund money invested in the Thrift Savings plan to pull investments out of Chinese equities; reports said that there were around USD 4.5bln of these investments in Chinese stocks, however, the more important takeaway is that the US administration is apparently looking at measures to restrict portfolio flows, and that is a risk desks have been keeping an eye out for as US/China rhetoric is ramped ahead of November elections. Meanwhile, GOP Senators and Lyndsey Graham introduced a China sanctions legislation in relation to the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims, the latest move likely to further impact relations between the two nations. Elsewhere, on trade, China released the second raft of tariff waivers for US goods that will be exempted from China’s trade war tariffs, effective next week and will last one year up to May 19th. A total of 79 products have been included – comprising of rare earth ores, semiconductor parts, aircraft radar equipment, medical equipment, chemical, petrochemical products, and some precious metals – albeit the imports values of the products were not disclosed. Importers need to apply within six months to be considered for the waivers – “Tariffs that have already been levied will be refunded,” the statement said. The first round of exclusions was announced back in September last year – these included agri such as soybean and pork alongside petrochemical goods.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>NEGATIVE FFR: </strong>Several Fed speakers came out in aversion to negative rates again on Tuesday, ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s scheduled speech on Wednesday at 0900 ET<strong>. </strong>Kashkari (voter, dove) said policymakers have been unanimous in opposing negative rates, reiterating that he does not want to say ‘never’, but there are other things the Fed would need to do first. Kaplan (voter) said he would be against negative rates, citing the impact on intermediaries and money market funds; he is sceptical that the benefits would outweigh the costs. Bullard (non-voter) said negative rates are not a good option for the US, noting that the next step for the US would be a more explicit return to QE; Bullard said interest rates are expected to stay low, with or without strategies like YCC. As the list of Fed officials grows larger warning against the policy the Fed Funds futures market has begun to fade some of its recent strength which had taken contracts as near as November above par last week – March ’21 is the closet contract above par currently. However, efforts from Fed officials to walk back NIRP expectations were thwarted, somewhat, today after President Trump tweeted that the US should benefit from the “gift” of negative interest rates – ramping up the political pressure on Powell for Wednesday.</p><p><strong>FED SPEAK: </strong>Kaplan (voter) called for the Fed’s actions to be complemented by more fiscal stimulus, arguing it will be necessary, echoing Chair Powell - and other Fed officials - in wake of the recent FOMC; Barkin (non-voter) made similar comments again today. Kaplan warned that some businesses will be lost during this crisis, including restaurants and service sector firms. Elsewhere, Fed’s Harker (voter) said banks should not be issuing large dividends at the moment. On the economy, Harker noted the recovery will be uneven, and Q2 will be painful but wants to ensure every sector has access to liquidity. Newswire regular Bullard (non-voter, dove) thinks that the shutdown could last around 120 days without further knock-on effects. Bullard said that the Fed’s balance sheet, at USD 10trln, sounds high, and he expects programmes to wind down as the crisis eases - for reference, the size of the balance sheet is around USD 6.7trln, and many analysts expect it to rise to between 8-10trln in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>BoE's Broadbent, when questioned about negative interest rates, stated the MPC is prepared to do what is needed, and the bank must consider if more harm than good would be done with NIRP. Broadbent added the bank keeps all policy tools under review. Broadbent stated the aim of QE is to help the Bank meet its inflation target and not finance the government.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 10+ TICKS HIGHER AT 138-30+</strong></p><p>The TPLEX traded firmer on Tuesday amid the duration bazooka Treasury supply, lacklustre risk appetite, and China risk. Treasuries had been richening ahead of the record size 10-year auction, supported by a 0.8% M/M decline in April CPI, in addition to equity downside as US futures struggled to break key resistance levels after the cash open. The USD 32bln 10-year auction stopped through the 0.712% WI by 1.2bps, covered 2.69x (vs average 2.46x), while dealers took just 20.52% (vs average 26.3%) – a successful all-round auction amid the new record refunding. Note that concession for the auction may have already taken place in prior sessions, in which the 10-year yield had risen from lows of 61bps on Friday to 70bps at the time of today’s auction. The Fed’s activeness in the market may have also limited pushing yields much further, despite the 30-year auction on Wednesday and the continued deluge of corporate deals; not to mention the new 20-year maturity arriving next week. Post the auction, duration continued to catch a bid after reports that GOP Senators had introduced new China sanctions legislation due to its treatment of Uighur Muslims. By settlement, the curve had firmly bull flattened.</p><p><strong>CREDIT: </strong>The NY Fed’s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCFF) today went operational in its purchases of corporate ETFs. As it stands, it is now quite clear if it actually purchased any ETFs today, but the announcement caught a lot of media attention, while the large US IG ETF (LQD) and US HY ETF (HYG) were both firmer on the session despite poor risk appetite, perhaps due to Fed purchases, or more likely, participants front-running expected Fed purchases, as has been the case since the facility’s announcement. The SMCFF <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200409a2.pdf\">term sheet</a> notes that it would “avoid purchasing shares of eligible ETFs when they trade at prices that materially exceed the estimated net asset value (NAV) of the underlying portfolio,” therefore, as both LQD and HYG currently trade slightly firmer than NAV, it remains to be seen if the Fed would currently be purchasing such ETFs, as well as what defines a price that “materially exceeds” NAV – it could be that the Fed would initiate its purchases in some of the less liquid ETFs that trade at discounts to the NAV, saving most of its ammo for times of acute stress, such as the March blowout.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY:</strong> The Treasury will auction USD 42bln 3-year notes (Mon), USD 32bln 10-year notes (Tue), and USD 22bln 30-year bonds (Wed). This week’s auction will be revealing, given the Treasury’s boosted refunding announcement last week. UBS notes that this week, around USD 86bln cash will fall due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and USD 29bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>PREVIEW - 30-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> A more significant concession might be appropriate, relative to the 10-year supply, BMO believes, noting within the 1.35-1.40% range, the 30-year sector has continued to underperform the balance of the curve, which has led to re-steepening particularly in 2s10s and 5s30s; BMO believes more steepening could be in store as a result of the front-end of the curve being anchored to monetary policy expectations, and the second wave of steepening is likely to occur when evidence of upward pressure on inflation is seen; for the time being, the probability of inflation expectations spiking any time soon is limited.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.325%, six-auction avg. 1.964%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.5bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.35x, six-auction avg. 2.40x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 22.6%, six-auction avg. 19.8%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 11.0%, six-auction avg. 16.5%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.8%)</li></ul><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI FUTURES (M0) SETTLES USD 1.64 HIGHER AT USD 25.78; WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 1.25 HIGHER AT USD 26.33; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 0.29 HIGHER AT USD 29.98</strong></p><p>Crude oil futures were firmer on Tuesday, particularly WTI, after finding support from constructive OPEC+ comments in addition to the latest EIA forecasts. Note that after Monday, where futures failed to sustain their bid after Saudi, Kuwait, and UAE announced they would be making additional cuts, futures managed to hold ground today, catching a spike higher on a sources piece hitting the tape that OPEC+ wants to keep oil production cuts of 9.7mln BPD beyond June, and not to scale back the cuts. Meanwhile, later session gains had been attributed to the EIA’s latest monthly report, which suggested inventories would begin drawing in July 2020 and continuing through the till the end of 2021. Separately, US President Trump tweeted that US energy companies are starting to look very good as oil prices are rising due to cuts from Saudi Arabia. However, Dallas Fed’s Kaplan said the Permian Basin output will shrink by a million BPD, and will see bankruptcies and restructuring – which he said could take until the end of 2021 to work off excess inventories. Participants now look ahead to this week’s US inventory reports, with the private data due later today, ahead of the EIA release on Wednesday; current expectations (bbls): crude +4.1mln, gasoline -2.2mln, distillates +2.9mln.</p><p><strong>EIA </strong>cut its 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 2.9mln BPD to 8.13mln BPD Y/Y decrease; 2021 world oil demand forecast cut by 580k BPD to 6.99mln BPD Y/Y increase. 2020 US crude output is to fall by 540k BPD (prev. 470k BPD) to 11.69mln BPD; 2021 US crude output is to fall by 790k BPD (prev. 730k BPD) to 10.90mln BPD.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US CPI: </strong>US consumer prices fell 0.8% M/M in April (in line with consensus, prev. -0.4%) and 0.3% Y/Y (slightly short of consensus, prev. 1.5%); the core measure fell by 0.2% M/M (exp. -0.2% M/M, prev. -0.1%) and 1.4% Y/Y (exp. 1.7% Y/Y, rev. 2.1%). It was the second straight negative M/M print. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the headline was weighed on by gas prices (which shaved 0.6ppts off the headline) though this was partially offset by the biggest rise seen in food prices in 46 years (+2.6% M/M), as meat prices surged amid reduced supply. The consultancy believes that core forecasts always looked too optimistic, given that March only captured the start of the lockdown. Within the details, it was notable that rent prices, which make up over 40% of the core CPI measure, rising by 0.2% M/M, short of the trend rate. Ahead, Pantheon notes that core inflation at 1.4% is down from 2.4% just two months ago, and it expects a further decline in the readings ahead, taking it to beneath 1.0% Y/Y by July, though it does not expect sustained deflation, explaining that the collapse in components like clothing prices, for example, will be limited by the rotation of seasonal inventory and the reopening of retail stores, while airline traffic and hotel occupancy rates are now gradually rising, albeit from incredibly depressed levels.</p><p><strong>CHINESE INFLATION (APR.): </strong>CPI YY rose 3.3% vs. Exp. 3.7%, down from the prior 4.3%. The easing price pressures were mainly a factor of increased food supply amid a post-virus recovery in production. Food prices rose 14.8% YY, down 3.5 ppts from March. Core CPI edged lower from 1.2% to 1.1%. Meanwhile, PPI fell 3.1% YY, a deeper fall than the forecast 2.6%, with the decline rate accelerating for the third month in a row- impacted by the declines in commodities in the international markets due to the pandemic. The data overnight was largely side-lined as focus shifted onto developments on the US-Sino trade front – with the metrics potentially proving obsolete should tensions between the nations ramp up.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -2.1% at, NDQ -2% at 9112, DJIA -1.9% at 23,765.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Real Estate -4.3%, Industrials -2.8%, Financials -2.7%, Energy -2.4%, Discretionary -2.3%, Technology -2.1%, Materials -1.6%, Health Care -1.5%, Utilities -0.9%, Staples -0.9%, Staples -0.9%, Communications -0.5%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Uber UBER) reportedly approached GrubHub (GRUB) with a takeover offer, according to sources, which note UBER proposed an all-stock merger and the two continue to discuss a potential tie-up. GRUB is said to seek 2.15 UBER shares for each GRUB share, although UBER said to only offer 2 shares. Boeing Company (BA) CEO expects passenger traffic will not return to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels by September, but perhaps towards 50% by the end of the year. However, CEO Calhoun does not expect traffic to return to normal for three years. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Musk tweeted that Tesla is restarting production against Alameda County rules with himself working alongside the employees. The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is reportedly accepting hotel reservations on its site from July 1st, according to Travel Weekly. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has been suggested by Elliott Advisors to explore a sale. Hyatt (H) announced it is to lay off up to 1300 workers and cut pay for senior management, board members, and employees in its restructuring move.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Simon Property Group (SPG) missed on EPS and revenue, although it announced it is planning to open half of its properties within the next week. Both Caesars (CZR) and Eldorado Resorts (ERI) missed on EPS and revenue, while CZR announced it plans to resume operations at some of its properties when it is allowed by those in charge of the reopening, although it notes it cannot accurately predict when consumers will return to normality. It also added that casinos in Louisiana could open as early as this weekend. DataDog (DDOG) beat on EPS and revenue while it also guided analyst expectations for both FY and Q2. Hertz (HTZ) missed on EPS and revenue, while also noting management may not be able to repay or refinance its debt facilities before maturities and it may not have enough cash from operations or liquidity to sustain its operating needs or meet obligations over the next year.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD, CNH: </strong>The dollar failed to hold onto gains and DXY tumbled back beneath the 100 mark from highs of 100.55 to lows of 99.65. The dollar sell-off was accompanied with lower yields while risk overall was cautious; equities flat/down, cyclicals mixed. The majority of Fed speakers leaned back against negative rates, although US President Trump is an advocate. China’s offshore yuan gave back gains against the dollar, amid more punchy rhetoric between the two nations, that has traders on edge once again ahead of Presidential elections in November. Attention will be on the PBOC’s yuan fixing overnight after news that some US Senators had introduced legislation to slap sanctions on the nation due to their treatment of minorities. On the data front, Chinese consumer prices missed expectations, which analysts have said bolsters the case for the central bank to add support.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>USDJPY reversed some of the gains seen on Monday due to the weakness in the greenback, although the continued punchy US/China rhetoric was adding JPY support and some desks continue to eye JPY as a US/China hedge. Elsewhere on yesterday’s upside, JPMorgan are not really sure this is the start of anything too impressive in the JPY market other than a reversal of the relative exuberance towards the JPY we have seen over the past week and remains on the sideline for now.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP): </strong>Cyclicals were hit on continued US/China rhetoric, although AUD was particularly lower overnight after China banned four Australian beef exporters signalling a further deterioration in the relationship between the two after Australia called for an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus, where China warned that this could see a Chinese consumer boycott. However, overnight losses were pared amid a falling dollar, and AUD seemed magnetic to 0.65 through US trade. NZD saw similar price action although fared better than its Antipodean counterpart given the rising tensions between China and Australia. GBP saw further downside today and resides around the 1.2275 mark at pixel time. Chancellor Sunak today announced they will be extending the furlough scheme from June to October and will continue to pay 80% of wages. The scheme is costing GBP 8bln a month, Sunak said, who added employers will be asked to share the cost of the scheme. On the monetary side, BoE’s Broadbent noted al policy tools are under review and when questions about NIRP he stated “the MPC is prepared to do what is needed”, seemingly not ruling out negative rates, but neither advocating for it.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (CAD, RUB, MXN): </strong>Overall petrocurrencies are mixed, both CAD and MXN failed to benefit from the weaker dollar and firmer oil prices, though the RUB did benefit. Oil settled firmer after a choppy session after its additional cut bid yesterday while it was further supported on sources that OPEC+ want to maintain level of current production cuts, rather than taper them down, while the latest EIA forecasts also supported the crude space. Despite oil gains/USD weakness, CAD was likely hampered by reports that retailers in Quebec reopening dates have been pushed back from this week until May 25th, while MXN may not be liking news that the military has been asked to return to the streets for the next five years, perhaps hampering consumer sentiment, with some holding opposition to the move stating soldiers and marines have frequently been accused of human rights violations, the Guardian reported. RUB held onto gains, albeit off best levels.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>EMFX was mixed, TRY, ZAR, and RUB were the outperformers as TRY continues its reversal from Friday and USDTRY now trades back beneath the 7.00 figure despite the ban on short selling from foreign banks being removed. Elsewhere, BRL underperformed once again despite BCB minutes signaling limits to the scope of further easing. However, in a further blow to President Bolsonaro reports note the Former Minister of Justice Lawyer noted the recording of the ministerial meeting confirms the statement from Bolsonaro that he wanted a new chief of police for personal reasons to “receive information and intelligence reports”. After accusations of the statement, the Attorney General stated if this was true, Bolsonaro has broken numerous laws.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The single currency benefitted from the dollar weakness today, while little has changed on the GCC court ruling, a judge noted that the message to the ECB was very mild, while ECB’s Stournaras noted markets do not seem to believe its decision will be a grave issue on monetary policy although a solution is needed to avoid serious consequences.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD, CNH</strong>: The dollar failed to hold onto gains and DXY tumbled back beneath the 100 mark from highs of 100.55 to lows of 99.65. The dollar sell-off was accompanied with lower yields while risk overall was cautious; equities flat/down, cyclicals mixed. The majority of Fed speakers leaned back against negative rates, although US President Trump is an advocate. China’s offshore yuan gave back gains against the dollar, amid more punchy rhetoric between the two nations, that has traders on edge once again ahead of Presidential elections in November. Attention will be on the PBOC’s yuan fixing overnight after news that some US Senators had introduced legislation to slap sanctions on the nation due to their treatment of minorities. On the data front, Chinese consumer prices missed expectations, which analysts have said bolsters the case for the central bank to add support.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>USDJPY reversed some of the gains seen on Monday due to the weakness in the greenback, although the continued punchy US/China rhetoric was adding JPY support and some desks continue to eye JPY as a US/China hedge. Elsewhere on yesterday’s upside, JPMorgan are not really sure this is the start of anything too impressive in the JPY market other than a reversal of the relative exuberance towards the JPY we have seen over the past week, and remains on the sideline for now.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP):</strong> Cyclicals were hit on continued US/China rhetoric, although AUD was particularly lower overnight after China banned four Australian beef exporters signaling a further deterioration in the relationship between the two after Australia called for an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus, where China warned that this could see a Chinese consumer boycott. However, overnight losses were pared amid a falling dollar, and AUD seemed magnetic to 0.65 through US trade. NZD saw similar price action although fared better than its Antipodean counterpart given the rising tensions between China and Australia. GBP saw further downside today and resides around the 1.2275 mark at pixel time. Chancellor Sunak today announced they will be extending the furlough scheme from June to October and will continue to pay 80% of wages. The scheme is costing GBP 8bln a month, Sunak said, who added employers will be asked to share the cost of the scheme. On the monetary side, BoE’s Broadbent noted al policy tools are under review and when questions about NIRP he stated “the MPC is prepared to do what is needed”, seemingly not ruling out negative rates, but neither advocating for it.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (CAD, RUB, MXN): </strong>Overall petrocurrencies are mixed, both CAD and MXN failed to benefit from the weaker dollar and firmer oil prices, though the RUB did benefit. Oil settled firmer after a choppy session after its additional cut bid yesterday while it was further supported on sources that OPEC+ want to maintain level of current production cuts, rather than taper them down, while the latest EIA forecasts also supported the crude space. Despite oil gains/USD weakness, CAD was likely hampered by reports that retailers in Quebec reopening dates have been pushed back from this week until May 25th, while MXN may not be liking news that the military has been asked to return to the streets for the next five years, perhaps hampering consumer sentiment, with some holding opposition to the move stating soldiers and marines have frequently been accused of human rights violations, the Guardian reported. RUB held onto gains, albeit off best levels.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EMFX was mixed, TRY, ZAR and RUB were the outperformers as TRY continues its reversal from Friday and USDTRY now trades back beneath the 7.00 figure despite the ban on short selling from foreign banks being removed. Elsewhere, BRL underperformed once again despite BCB minutes signaling limits to the scope of further easing. However, in a further blow to President Bolsonaro reports note the Former Minister of Justice Lawyer noted the recording of the ministerial meeting confirms the statement from Bolsonaro that he wanted a new chief of police for personal reasons to “receive information and intelligence reports”. After accusations of the statement, the Attorney General stated if this was true, Bolsonaro has broken numerous laws.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency benefitted from the dollar weakness today, while little has changed on the GCC court ruling, a judge noted that the message to the ECB was very mild, while ECB’s Stournaras noted markets do not seem to believe its decision will be a grave issue on monetary policy although a solution is needed to avoid serious consequences.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The TPLEX traded firmer on Tuesday amid the duration bazooka Treasury supply, lacklustre risk appetite and China risk. Treasuries had been richening ahead of the record size 10-year auction, supported by a 0.8% M/M decline in April CPI, in addition to equity downside as US futures struggled to break key resistance levels after the cash open. The USD 32bln 10-year auction stopped through the 0.712% WI by 1.2bps, covered 2.69x (vs average 2.46x), while dealers took just 20.52% (vs average 26.3%) – a successful all-round auction amid the new record refunding. Note that concession for the auction may have already taken place in prior sessions, in which the 10-year yield had risen from lows of 61bps on Friday to 70bps at the time of today’s auction. The Fed’s activeness in the market may have also limited pushing yields much further, despite the 30-year auction on Wednesday and the continued deluge of corporate deals; not to mention the new 20-year maturity arriving next week. Post the auction, duration continued to catch a bid after reports that GOP Senators had introduced new China sanctions legislation due to its treatment of Uighur Muslims. By settlement, the curve had firmly bull flattened...</p><p><strong>CREDIT: </strong>The NY Fed’s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCFF) today went operational in its purchases of corporate ETFs. As it stands, it is not quite clear if it actually purchased any ETFs today, but the announcement caught a lot of media attention, while the large US IG ETF (LQD) and US HY ETF (HYG) were both firmer on the session despite poor risk appetite, perhaps due to Fed purchases, or more likely, participants front-running expected Fed purchases, as has been the case since the facility’s announcement. The SMCFF <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200409a2.pdf\">term sheet</a> notes that it would “avoid purchasing shares of eligible ETFs when they trade at prices that materially exceed the estimated net asset value (NAV) of the underlying portfolio,” therefore, as both LQD and HYG currently trade slightly firmer than NAV, it remains to be seen if the Fed would currently be purchasing such ETFs, as well as what defines a price that “materially exceeds” NAV – it could be that the Fed would initiate its purchases in some of the less liquid ETFs that trade at discounts to the NAV, saving most of its ammo for times of acute stress, such as the March blowout.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> A more significant concession might be appropriate, relative to the 10-year supply, BMO believes, noting within the 1.35-1.40% range, the 30-year sector has continued to underperform the balance of the curve, which has led to re-steepening particularly in 2s10s and 5s30s; BMO believes more steepening could be in store as a result of the front-end of the curve being anchored to monetary policy expectations, and the second wave of steepening is likely to occur when evidence of upward pressure on inflation is seen; for the time being, the probability of inflation expectations spiking any time soon is limited.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.325%, six-auction avg. 1.964%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.5bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.35x, six-auction avg. 2.40x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 22.6%, six-auction avg. 19.8%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 11.0%, six-auction avg. 16.5%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.8%)</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, later session gains had been attributed to the EIA’s latest monthly report, which suggested inventories would begin drawing in July 2020 and continuing through the till the end of 2021. Separately, US President Trump tweeted that US energy companies are starting to look very good as oil prices are rising due to cuts from Saudi Arabia.

The sides reportedly agreed to work together to create a beneficial environment for carrying out the trade deal, while they agreed good progress was made to make deal a success and that both sides fully expect obligations to be met. Subsequently, SCMP reported that a Chinese Gov’t Adviser, on the US-China phone call, suggested that the fact that “the dialogue has now gone straight to ministerial level may indicate the problem is quite severe”. This was later followed by US President Trump noting he is having a hard time with China in regard to the deal, although no final decision has yet been made. NEC Director Kudlow held the same view, noting the relationship is complex, adding they have not been transparent and will be held accountable once the final results are in, although he did not say how. China has now also been called on by the US Chamber of Commerce to dramatically accelerate its US good purchases under the Phase One trade deal as China’s economy returns to normality.</p>",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Treasury to auction 3-year on Mon, 10-year on Tue, 30-year on Wed; bias is towards a steeper curve, analysts say",
        "content": "<p><strong>TACTICAL BIAS: </strong>Fed guidance on rates (staying at these low levels for the foreseeable), buying concentrated in the belly, and the possibility of yield curve control (YCC) is outweighing the flood of bill supply in the short-end of the curve, TD Securities argues, keeping rates anchored at low levels. Meanwhile, the long-end of the curve is under pressure as a result of rising Treasury supply. This should give the curve a steeper bias.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY:</strong> The Treasury will auction USD 42bln 3-year notes (Mon), USD 32bln 10-year notes (Tue), and USD 22bln 30-year bonds (Wed). This week's auction will be revealing, given the Treasury's boosted refunding announcement last week. UBS notes that this week, around USD 86bln cash will fall due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and USD 29bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.348%, six-auction avg. 1.189%)</li><li>Tail: 1.2bps (prev. , six-auction avg. 0.7bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.28x, six-auction avg. 2.44x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 40.5%, six-auction avg. 35.9%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 4.1%, six-auction avg. 13.9%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 55.4%, six-auction avg. 50.2%)</li></ul><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> There is still demand for 10-year even at slightly higher yields than present, analysts say, citing price action after Wednesday’s Treasury refunding announcement when 10-year yields closed 3-4bps higher, but rallied on Thursday back to within the 0.60-65% range (and respected the 0.78% top-end of its broader range). BMO argues, and that the liquidity advantages of Treasury auctions will continue to bring in buyers, and notes that sponsorship seen in recent auctions has come despite a dramatic repricing in yields, and we have seen several stop-throughs at record low yields, even with record auction sizes. BMO thinks this is an encouraging sign that the supply can be absorbed with little concession, and it does not expect the broader 0.54-0.78% 10-year Treasury yield range will be challenged as a result of this week’s supply. It does, however, think there is a risk the high-yield could stop-out above 0.70%.</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.782%, six-auction avg. 1.462%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.43x, six-auction avg. 2.46x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 27.6%, six-auction avg. 26.3%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 13.2%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 59.2%, six-auction avg. 59.6%)</li></ul><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> A more significant concession might be appropriate, relative to the 10-year supply, BMO believes, noting within the 1.35-1.40% range, the 30-year sector has continued to underperform the balance of the curve, which has led to re-steepening particularly in 2s10s and 5s30s; BMO believes more steepening could be in store as a result of the front-end of the curve being anchored to monetary policy expectations, and the second wave of steepening is likely to occur when evidence of upward pressure on inflation is seen; for the time being, the probability of inflation expectations spiking any time soon is limited.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.325%, six-auction avg. 1.964%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.5bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.35x, six-auction avg. 2.40x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 22.6%, six-auction avg. 19.8%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 11.0%, six-auction avg. 16.5%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.8%)</li></ul><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed Funds futures for the turn of the year rose above par last week, signalling a probability above zero that the Fed could lower rates into negative territory next year. The moves above par were modest, and pared back at the end of the week (Nov 2020 FF was above par early Friday, but only the Feb 2021 contract closed out the week at/above par). Goldman Sachs is surprised by market's implying negative yields (even if modest) given that Fed speakers have generally been averse to such moves. GS says that, while it is hard to rule out, the pricing in seems a bit aggressive given current expectations for the economy, and even if the Fed were to explore negative rates, it would likely be reluctant to go deep, given political issues with penalising cash. Other think the pricing of negative rates might be more technical in nature.</p><p><strong>JAPANESE BUYERS:</strong> Talk of Japanese buyers coming back into the market makes sense, and the yen depreciating while Treasuries were rallying is consistent with that thesis. FX-hedged Treasuries for Japanese investors are looking somewhat attractive. Japanese had been buyers of Treasuries on an unhedged basis recently, and now they are attractive again on a hedged basis, and BMO would expect to see inflows continue from one of the largest-holders of Treasuries. However, it remains to be seen at what levels investors want to buy 30-year debt at.</p>",

However, further gains were unwound vs most major counterparts and EM currencies amidst a swathe of Fed rhetoric adding weight to the argument against negative rates, but highlighting the rationale behind aggressive policy stimulus and actions taken to combat the effects of COVID-19. The <strong>DXY</strong> appears to have found support and underlying bids in to 99.500, but the index remains well off best levels between 100.440-99.653 extremes in choppy conditions ahead of Fed chair Powell’s speech on Wednesday and with President Trump repeating his penchant for NIRP.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>Prime beneficiaries of the Buck’s change of fortunes, with the Norwegian Crown quickly regrouping after a post-Q1 GDP wobble to resume its bull run with assistance from firm crude prices, while the Swedish Krona kept pace and both managed to outdo the Euro even though the single currency staged an impressive recovery from sub-1.0800 lows vs the Dollar before fading around 1.0885. Indeed, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have retested recent lows and key technical levels within 11.1855-11.0220 and 10.7100-10.5785 respective ranges, with the latter now eyeing inflation data tomorrow and expectations from Prospera on Thursday. Elsewhere, the Franc is now firmly over 0.9700 and still keeping the SNB on its toes in cross terms near 1.0500 before Swiss import and producer prices that may well turn more deflationary in the same vein as CPI.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/JPY</strong></p><p>Also taking advantage of ‘turnaround Tuesday’ for the Greenback, with the Kiwi and Aussie back on big figure levels at 0.6100 and 0.6500 vs lows under 0.6050 and sub-0.6450 overnight, but heading into big potential independent drivers in the form of the RBNZ policy meeting (preview available via our Research Suite or Headline Feed) and April jobs report. Meanwhile, the Yen has bounced from circa 107.70 to over 107.25 against the backdrop of bull re-flattening along the US Treasury curve and awaiting Japanese trade and current account data.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP</strong></p><p>Relative G10 underperformers, or more rangebound against the Usd, but the Loonie did get a fillip to cross 1.4000 on the back of reports that 4 OPEC+ members want to keep the reduced output cap beyond the May-June period currently agreed to, in contrast to Sterling that stayed under pressure following dovish/downbeat comments from BoE’s Broadbent. Cable never really looked comfortable on the 1.2300 handle and Eur/Gbp rebounded to 0.8830 from just shy of 0.8760 at one stage, with UK GDP due before the midweek EU (and Liffe) ‘open’.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad appreciation vs the Buck, but eye-catching for obvious reasons is the Lira continuing its comeback to reclaim 7.0000+ status despite the ban on foreign banks being lifted, while the Real took some note of BCB minutes highlighting less room for further easing and the Mexican Peso was relieved that IP was not as bad as anticipated or feared.</p>",

Market sentiment has stabilised as the Europeans arrived. However, SPX opened with marginal gains although gains which have since reversed to negative territory amid a further pushback on negative rates from Fed’s Bullard (Dove) and Kaplan (voter), joining Evans and Bostic, with eyes on Powell tomorrow. Yields are moving lower, and the curve is flattening ahead of 10-year supply; the DXY is slightly down around 40bps, while gold continues to consolidate around USD 1,700. Oil is higher with desks attributing yesterday’s announcements from Saudi/Kuwait/UAE on additional supply curbs, although it failed to sustain gains at the time. &nbsp;SECTORS: The majority of sectors initially opened in positive territory although many are now in negative after a move lower in equities overall. Defensives (Staples, Health Care, Utilities) lead the way, although Materials among those led by post earnings gains in International Flavours and Fragrance (IFF) and Amcor (AMCR). Elsewhere, Real Estate is the laggard despite the announcement from SPG that it is planning to reopen half of its stores within a week. Health care is flat and Technology in the red after a solid day of gains yesterday. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFCS: </strong>Boeing Company (BA) CEO expects passenger traffic will not return to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels by September, but perhaps towards 50% by the end of the year. However, CEO Calhoun does not expect traffic to return to normal for three years. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Musk tweeted that Tesla is restarting production against Alameda County rules with himself working alongside the employees. The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is reportedly accepting hotel reservations on its site from July 1st, according to Travel Weekly. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) have been suggested by Elliott Advisors to explore a sale. Hyatt (H) announced it is to lay off up to 1300 workers and cut pay for senior management, board members, and employees in its restructuring move.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Simon Property Group (SPG) missed on EPS and revenue, although it announced it is planning to open half of its properties within the next week. Both Caesars (CZR) and Eldorado Resorts (ERI) missed on EPS and revenue, while CZR announced it plans to resume operations at some of its properties when it is allowed by those in charge of the reopening, although it notes it cannot accurately predict when consumers will return to normality. It also added that casinos in Louisiana could open as early as this weekend. DataDog (DDOG) beat on EPS and revenue while it also provided guidance above analyst expectations for both FY and Q2. Hertz (HTZ) missed on EPS and revenue, while also noting management may not be able to repay or refinance its debt facilities prior to maturities and it may not have enough cash from operations or liquidity to sustain its operating needs or meet obligations over the next year. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>TOP STORIES:</strong> <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-fed-to-buy-corporate-debt-via-etfs-us-ig-bonds-likely-to-outperform-treasuries-capital-economics-says-12-05-2020\">NY Fed said</a> it would begin buying US corporate debt ETFs.

It will consider several factors in determining which ETFs to purchase, including the composition of IG and non-IG rated debt, the management style, the amount of debt held in depository institutions, the average tenor of underlying debt, the total assets under management, the average daily trading volume, and leverage, if any. Note that in its term sheet it said it would not purchase ETFs with market prices that \"materially exceed\" their NAV. This should provide a further tailwind for corporate bonds, analysts believe. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-fed-to-buy-corporate-debt-via-etfs-us-ig-bonds-likely-to-outperform-treasuries-capital-economics-says-12-05-2020\">Full analysis here. &nbsp; &nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> Despite some <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-hawkish-china-voices-call-for-termination-of-us-phase-one-deal-11-05-2020\">sourced articles</a> in recent days calling into question whether China should abide by the Phase One trade deal, the official line from China remains that the deal should implemented, according to headlines today. However, the question may be more about whether it remains feasible. Goldman Sachs notes that the USD 200bln purchase agreement looks increasingly challenging due to COVID-19 and low energy prices, and that November’s Presidential Election may make it harder for US policymakers to strike a conciliatory tone on China given public opinion in the US has turned more negative towards the nation. But for now, these trade tensions appear to be a secondary focus, GS says citing its proprietary US/China trade tension indicators, which suggests that China-related assets have not been driven much by risk related to trade tensions. And similarly, the bank notes that the correlation of Mainland China risk proxies with its Risk Appetite Indicator has fallen significantly. But GS still thinks that the renewed US-China trade tensions could represent an additional source of negative shocks. “Our China equity strategists' trade tensions barometer suggests markets are still factoring in a relatively benign outcome for the bilateral trade relationship; in equities, Kospi and HSCEI implied volatility is near historical lows compared to the S&amp;P 500 and could be an attractive hedge to this risk.” &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>AAPL:</strong> UBS Evidence Lab team thinks that there could be pent-up demand for AAPL products with consumers’ purchase intent improving, and consumers having more discretionary spend available (fewer vacations, dining out, etc.). Its Asia supply chain work suggests improvement in build plans for the June quarter, and besides a replacement cycle driven upgrade cycle, it believes 5G could also play a role , and says it is comfortable with its C21 iPhone unit estimate of roughly +25% Y/Y). UBS smartphone survey of 7k consumers across five countries showed strong improvement in purchase intent, and improving intent for Apple in all regions. It also notes that services is becoming more material part of Apple's gross profit, and given the recurring nature of the business, it suggests that it should help AAPL’s stock multiple - accounted for 39% of gross profit in March quarter, and though March is a seasonally weak quarter for products, for the FY it expects services to account for 35% of gross profit, and is forecasting services gross profit mix to be higher than 41% on an annual basis over the next five years. UBS explains its PT is based on around 20x its calendar 2021 estimated EPS of USD 16.22. AAPL is trading at around 22x forward EPS and above the 5-year to 10-year average of around 14x, UBS says, and it is trading at a 6% premium to S&amp;P versus its 1-year average of 7%. “We believe a slight premium to history is justified given possibly stronger 2021 and long-term opportunities from 5G/foldable phones, wearables, and new services.”</p>",

A total of 79 products have been included – comprising of rare earth ores, semiconductor parts, aircraft radar equipment, medical equipment, chemical, petrochemical products, and some precious metals – albeit the imports values of the products were not disclosed.</li></ul><h2>DOW JONES</h2><ul><li><strong>Apple Inc. (AAPL)</strong> (Information Technology/Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals) UBS Evidence Lab team thinks that there could be pent-up demand for AAPL products with consumers’ purchase intent improving, and consumers having more discretionary spend available (fewer vacations, dining out, etc.). Its Asia supply chain work suggests an improvement in build plans for the June quarter, and besides a replacement cycle driven upgrade cycle, it believes 5G could also play a role, and says it is comfortable with its C21 iPhone unit estimate of roughly +25% Y/Y). UBS smartphone survey of 7k consumers across five countries showed strong improvement in purchase intent, and improving intent for Apple in all regions. It also notes that services are becoming more material part of Apple’s gross profit, and given the recurring nature of the business, it suggests that it should help AAPL’s stock multiple - accounted for 39% of gross profit in March quarter, and though March is a seasonally weak quarter for products, for the FY it expects services to account for 35% of gross profit and is forecasting services gross profit mix to be higher than 41% on an annual basis over the next five years. UBS explains its PT is based on around 20x its calendar 2021 estimated EPS of USD 16.22. AAPL is trading at around 22x forward EPS and above the 5-year to 10-year average of around 14x, UBS says, and it is trading at a 6% premium to S&amp;P versus its 1-year average of 7%. “We believe a slight premium to history is justified given possibly stronger 2021 and long-term opportunities from 5G/foldable phones, wearables, and new services.”</li><li><strong>Boeing Company (BA) </strong>(Industrials/Aerospace &amp; Defense) CEO expects passenger traffic will not return to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels by September, but perhaps towards 50% by the end of the year.

However, no formal announcement has been made.</li><li><strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> (Consumer Staples/Hypermarkets &amp; Super Centers) – UBS expects to see SSS of 7% for the full quarter, consisting of a 3% core SSS in February, 18% in March and 6% in April as stay-at-home orders went into effect. The desk writes, in almost any scenario, the retail giant should emerge in a better position than it was before the pandemic, noting how a change in consumer behaviour will benefit WMT in areas of low prices, omnichannel shopping, trip consolidation, and only groceries.</li></ul><h2>NASDAQ 100</h2><ul><li><strong>Tesla (TSLA) </strong>(Consumer Discretionary/Automobiles) CEO Musk tweeted that Tesla is restarting production against Alameda County rules with himself working alongside the employees.</li><li><strong>United Continental Holdings (UAL)</strong> (Industrials/Airlines) announced it has named executive and Chief Administrative Officer, Brett Hart, as president of the company.</li></ul><h2>S&amp;P 500</h2><ul><li><strong>Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)</strong> (Health Care/Biotechnology) have been suggested by Elliott Advisors to explore a sale.</li><li><strong>Amcor plc (AMCR)</strong> (Materials/Paper Packaging) Q3 20 (USD): EPS 0.10 (exp. 0.16), Revenue 2.31bln (exp. 3.22bln).</li><li><strong>Ameren Corp (AEE) </strong>(Utilities/Multi-Utilities)<strong> </strong>Q1 20 (USD): EPS 0.59 (exp. 0.70), Revenue 1.44bln (exp. 1.6bln).

Of note in particular, the Antipodes and Scandis are gleaning impetus from the Greenback’s retreat amidst renewed risk appetite, with EM currencies also taking advantage and the Turkish Lira back above 7.0000. However, sentiment and price action is whippy and prone to change abruptly on breaking news and headlines. Back to debt markets, Gilts carved out another new Liffe high at 137.49 before fading again, while Bunds slipped to a slightly deeper Eurex base at 172.91 and USTs are holding in range with a flatter bias.</p>",

It will consider several factors in determining which ETFs to purchase, including the composition of IG and non-IG rated debt, the management style, the amount of debt held in depository institutions, the average tenor of underlying debt, the total assets under management, the average daily trading volume, and leverage, if any. Note that in its term sheet it said it would not purchase ETFs with market prices that \"materially exceed\" their NAV. This should provide a further tailwind for corporate bonds, analysts believe.

However, the question may be more about whether it remains feasible. Goldman Sachs notes that the USD 200bln purchase agreement looks increasingly challenging due to COVID-19 and low energy prices, and that November’s Presidential Election may make it harder for US policymakers to strike a conciliatory tone on China given public opinion in the US has turned more negative towards the nation. But for now, these trade tensions appear to be a secondary focus, GS says citing its proprietary US/China trade tension indicators, which suggests that China-related assets have not been driven much by risk related to trade tensions. And similarly, the bank notes that the correlation of Mainland China risk proxies with its Risk Appetite Indicator has fallen significantly. But GS still thinks that the renewed US-China trade tensions could represent an additional source of negative shocks. “Our China equity strategists' trade tensions barometer suggests markets are still factoring in a relatively benign outcome for the bilateral trade relationship; in equities, Kospi and HSCEI implied volatility is near historical lows compared to the S&amp;P 500 and could be an attractive hedge to this risk.”</p><p><strong>AAPL:</strong> UBS Evidence Lab team thinks that there could be pent-up demand for AAPL products with consumers’ purchase intent improving, and consumers having more discretionary spend available (fewer vacations, dining out, etc.). Its Asia supply chain work suggests improvement in build plans for the June quarter, and besides a replacement cycle driven upgrade cycle, it believes 5G could also play a role , and says it is comfortable with its C21 iPhone unit estimate of roughly +25% Y/Y). UBS smartphone survey of 7k consumers across five countries showed strong improvement in purchase intent, and improving intent for Apple in all regions. It also notes that services is becoming more material part of Apple's gross profit, and given the recurring nature of the business, it suggests that it should help AAPL’s stock multiple - accounted for 39% of gross profit in March quarter, and though March is a seasonally weak quarter for products, for the FY it expects services to account for 35% of gross profit, and is forecasting services gross profit mix to be higher than 41% on an annual basis over the next five years. UBS explains its PT is based on around 20x its calendar 2021 estimated EPS of USD 16.22. AAPL is trading at around 22x forward EPS and above the 5-year to 10-year average of around 14x, UBS says, and it is trading at a 6% premium to S&amp;P versus its 1-year average of 7%. “We believe a slight premium to history is justified given possibly stronger 2021 and long-term opportunities from 5G/foldable phones, wearables, and new services.”</p>",

Italy’s FTSE MIB (+0.7%) outperforms the region as banks continue to feel tailwinds from yesterday’s reports that Italy’s Gov’t is said to be mulling state guarantees for up to EUR 15bln of bonds issued by banks. Sectors are mixed, but defensives broadly outperform cyclicals; with the breakdown painting a similar picture. Telecom names stand as the marked outperformer as earnings from giant Vodafone (+8.1%) bolster the sector. Vodafone’s stellar FY prelim results see a YY rise across group revenue, adj. EBITDA, and operating profit, whilst Q4 organic services revenue topped forecasts and FY guidance for Adj. EBIT and Capex were raised on account of its UK assets merger with Liberty Global. Peers Orange (+1.2%) and Telecom Italia (+2.2%) rise in tandem, albeit gains are less pronounced in BT (+0.2%) shares amid its direct competitor's solid results. The sector also sees tailwinds from ProseibenSat (+11.5%) whose shares were propelled to the top of the Stoxx 600 after KKR acquired ~5.2% stake in the Co, with 3.21% in shares and 2.0% through financial instruments. KKR believes that the Co. is undervalued. Turning to other movers; Thyssenkrupp (-9.0%) holds onto post-earning losses on the back of deteriorating Q2 net, deeper negative EPS, and debt almost doubling YY. The Co. also said it cannot rule out Q3 loss of up to EUR 1bln.

Note also, mixed survey news for the Aussie to digest via NAB’s April business survey as sentiment improved, but conditions deteriorated further awaiting Thursday’s labour data.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF - </strong>The Pound is looking precarious again across the board, and perhaps the mere mention of negative UK rates from BoE’s Broadbent may have rattled a few longs with Cable just maintaining 1.2300+ status and Eur/Gbp hovering a few pips below 0.8800 even though the single currency has retreated against the Dollar around the 1.0800 handle where more decent option expiries reside (1.4 bn from the round number to 1.0805). Moreover, the Euro continues to unwind recovery gains vs the Franc towards 1.0500, while Usd/Chf drifts back from 0.9750 to eye 0.9700 again as the Greenback loses momentum in general. Indeed, the DXY has topped out within a 100.440-020 range despite more Fed push backs on NIRP before FOMC chair Powell speaks on Wednesday and CPI in the iterim.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD -</strong> Both rangy and narrowly mixed against the Buck, with the Yen paring some losses either side of 107.50 and Loonie bouncing to within a whisker of 1.4000 from 1.4060+ against the backdrop of mildly firm crude prices in the run up to Canada’s leading index for April due at the same time as US NFIB.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> In contrast to yesterday’s inflation beats, Norwegian GDP was weak and accompanied by significant upward revisions to 2020 deficit and spending forecasts, but the Nok has reversed initial or knee-jerk declines to around 11.1850 alongside the Sek to resume uptrends vs the Eur. Similarly, no sign of a turnaround Tuesday for the Try as it stages an encouraging effort to sustain retracement from record lows vs the Usd and almost revisited the 7.0000 mark.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: 1.0790 (500M), <strong>1.0800-05 (1.4BLN)</strong>, 1.0835 (250M), <strong>1.0870-75 (1BLN)</strong></p><p>China imposed an import ban on 4 Australian abattoirs.

However, bears remain poised into upticks and the debt future is back in negative territory from a fresh 137.45 Liffe high (+9 ticks vs -32 ticks at the trough) alongside <strong>Bunds</strong> that remain just a few ticks above 173.00 and a bit more divergent from the periphery in wake of another ECB member talking about the possibility of increasing the PEPP. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are still outperforming EU equivalents with the curve flipping back to marginal flattening ahead of CPI, 10 year supply and Fed chair Powell tomorrow, and with little rection to a fall in NFIB business confidence on the basis that it was on the cards.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> futures eked mild gains early doors and extended on gains after a relatively contained APAC session after participants digested over-compliance from Saudi, Kuwait, and UAE. News-flow has once again been light for the complex throughout the first half of European trade, although participants will be eyeing the US-Sino trade saga after China released a second list of tariff waivers for US goods. Traders will also be eyeing airlines’ revised schedules to gauge the demand on that front, with Ryanair today stating that it plans to restore some 40% of scheduled flights from July 1st. Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco reported its earnings – although more stock-specific and backward-looking, the group expects demand decline and oil prices to weigh on FY20 earnings. WTI June towards the top of today’s USD 24.22-25.35/bbl band whilst Brent July sees itself between a USD 29.62-30.40/bbl intraday parameter. <strong>Spot gold</strong> meanwhile derives its price action from the Dollar index – the yellow metal fluctuates on either side of USD 1700/oz.<strong> Copper</strong> prices track stocks and sentiment lower, although the red metal resides firmly north of USD 2.30/lb</p><p><strong>Saudi Aramco (2222 SR) - </strong>Q1 net income USD 16.7bln, FCF USD 15bln.

However, bears remain poised into upticks and the debt future is back in negative territory from a fresh 137.45 Liffe high (+9 ticks vs -32 ticks at the trough) alongside Bunds that remain just a few ticks above 173.00 and a bit more divergent from the periphery in wake of another ECB member talking about the possibility of increasing the PEPP. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are still outperforming EU equivalents with the curve flipping back to marginal flattening ahead of CPI, 10 year supply and Fed chair Powell tomorrow, and with little rection to a fall in NFIB business confidence on the basis that it was on the cards.</p>",

Note also, mixed survey news for the Aussie to digest via NAB’s April business survey as sentiment improved, but conditions deteriorated further awaiting Thursday’s labour data.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>The Pound is looking precarious again across the board, and perhaps the mere mention of negative UK rates from BoE’s Broadbent may have rattled a few longs with Cable just maintaining 1.2300+ status and Eur/Gbp hovering a few pips below 0.8800 even though the single currency has retreated against the Dollar around the 1.0800 handle where more decent option expiries reside (1.4 bn from the round number to 1.0805). Moreover, the Euro continues to unwind recovery gains vs the Franc towards 1.0500, while Usd/Chf drifts back from 0.9750 to eye 0.9700 again as the Greenback loses momentum in general. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> has topped out within a 100.440-020 range despite more Fed push backs on NIRP before FOMC chair Powell speaks on Wednesday and CPI in the iterim.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Both rangy and narrowly mixed against the Buck, with the Yen paring some losses either side of 107.50 and Loonie bouncing to within a whisker of 1.4000 from 1.4060+ against the backdrop of mildly firm crude prices in the run up to Canada’s leading index for April due at the same time as US NFIB.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to yesterday’s inflation beats, Norwegian GDP was weak and accompanied by significant upward revisions to 2020 deficit and spending forecasts, but the Nok has reversed initial or knee-jerk declines to around 11.1850 alongside the Sek to resume uptrends vs the Eur. Similarly, no sign of a turnaround Tuesday for the Try as it stages an encouraging effort to sustain retracement from record lows vs the Usd and almost revisited the 7.0000 mark.</p>",

This should provide a further tailwind for corporate bonds, analysts think.</li><li>Noting the recent outperformance of US IG bonds, Capital Economics sees them outperforming Treasuries over the next couple of years, it observes that although they have fallen back a long way since mid-March, corporate credit spreads are still very high by past standards, and since the turn of the century, they have only been higher during the GFC, the worst stages of the Eurozone crisis, and the dot com collapse.</li><li>CapEco admits that although the past relationships will not necessarily prove a reliable guide to the future, since the start of the coronavirus crisis, the Fed has launched corporate credit facilities which allow it to purchase up to about 8% of the entire US corporate bond market, and has revived its commercial paper funding facility (whose health is closely related to that of the corporate bond market).</li><li>\"The anticipation of those purchases seemed to help unthaw the market after a brief freeze in mid-March, and issuance has been extremely strong since, with even firms in the sectors worst-affected by lockdowns able to sell long-term bonds.\" CapEco also argues that the Fed’s actions so far also point to a willingness to do more if required. \"It has expanded the initial criteria of its corporate credit programs (to include sub-investment-grade bonds), and of its municipal bond program, for example, and the size of the programs could presumably be increased too if market conditions deteriorated, albeit with the Treasury providing more equity.\"</li><li>While it is hard to quantify how much difference such purchases and the possibility of more to come, have made or will make, CapEco says the example of Japan could provide clues: \"The central bank there had large holdings of corporate bonds and commercial paper prior to the coronavirus, and there was probably an assumption (recently proven correct) that it would do much more if needed. This may be one reason why spreads there have been far lower than elsewhere for years, even adjusting for different credit ratings and maturities.\"</li></ul>",

        "subject": "PRIMER: US April CPI due at 0830 ET/1330 BST; consensus expects a second consecutive negative M/M reading",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>Consensus is for -0.8% M/M in April (prev. -0.4%) and 0.4% Y/Y (prev. 1.5%); the core measure is seen at -0.2% M/M (prev. -0.1%) and 1.7% Y/Y (prev. 2.1%). If the consensus is realised, it would be the second straight negative M/M read, which has not been seen since Nov'14 to Jan'15, when three straight months of negative inflation was registered.</li><li><strong>THE DEBATE: </strong>Analysts are watching CPI data to determine whether the disinflationary pressures are transitory, or whether it becomes more persistent; this is not, of course, unlikely to be resolved in today’s data, and will only become clear in the coming months. It will also depend on how the recovery/normalisation unfolds.</li><li><strong>APRIL'S DATA: </strong>UBS thinks we are likely to see a repeat of March, where plunging gasoline, hotels and airfares more than offset any strength in food prices, electronics and medical care. However, in contrast to last month. \"With prices for lodging and gasoline appearing to have reached their bottom in the past couple of weeks, we project that the big declines in the CPI will be behind us following the release of the April data,\" UBS writes, \"that said, we expect the trend in the CPI in coming months will be below the trend prior to the virus-induced economic slowdown.\"</li><li><strong>MEDIUM-TERM: </strong>BMO's base case is for near-term downward pressure on inflation in the near-term, but once the economy is re-engaged, monetary and fiscal stimulus result will push CPI higher. That does imply a significant drop in the unemployment rate, though a quick drop in the jobless rate is not a universal view, with some suggesting it could be quarters rather than months before the labour market has normalised. While the data will be a result of the lockdown, it will also add to fuel to the debate on whether the US will face a deflationary spiral; BMO doubts the 'Japanification' of the economy will go that far, but a period of downward pressure on consumer prices is a foregone conclusion at this stage -- if for no other reason than the slide in energy prices.</li><li><strong>MARKET REACTION:</strong> BMO notes that both 5-year and 10-year breakevens are historically low, and argues that even if inflation recovered into the neighbourhood below the Fed's target, it may still present bearish impulses to the longer-end of the curve, and given where policy is, that would likely translate into a steeper curve. BMO is slightly sceptical of a classic bearish impulse in the belly of the curve, stating that if we saw inflationary pressure, it may be real yields that push lower since the nominal curve is anchored on Fed Funds expectations going forward, and that inflation compensation would likely manifest in lower real yields rather than higher nominal ones.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/3c245eff-9717-4021-b7ba-f2744b5cd64c.jpg\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/a0f352ef-e540-4c14-af63-a45312da3072.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: China released the second raft of tariff waivers for US goods that will be exempted from China’s trade war tariffs, effective next week and will last one year up to May 19th. A total of 79 products have been included – comprising of rare earth ores, semiconductor parts, aircraft radar equipment, medical equipment, chemical, petrochemical products, and some precious metals – albeit the imports values of the products were not disclosed. Importers need to apply within six months to be considered for the waivers – “Tariffs that have already been levied will be refunded,” the statement said. The first round of exclusions was announced back in September last year – these included agri such as soybean and pork alongside petrochemical goods.</p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The latest announcement comes amid heated tensions between the two sides – source reports via Global Times yesterday highlighted hawkish voices emerging from China calling for a re-negotiation of the Phase One deal to be better leveraged towards China’s interests. Yesterday’s piece notes of Chinese dissatisfaction amid compromises the side made to press ahead with Phase One. Officials are angered over US President Trump’s “cover-up” of his handling of the pandemic – thus advisers have been floating the possibility of voiding the trade pact.</p><p><strong>24HR DEVELOPMENTS:</strong> Following the Global Times’ report, US President Trump stated he is not happy with China and that he is not interested in reopening the US-China trade deal. At today’s press conference, Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman said both nations should implement the deal with “equality and mutual respect” – reiterating that both sides can reap benefits from the deal. Chinese analysts have downplayed a threat to the trade deal but added that there should be room to manoeuvre given the impact of the pandemic. However, a government-linked think-tank noted a feeling in China that the deal with the US is not reciprocal – chiming with the Global Times report.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: China has suspended imports from four Aussie abattoirs days after it announced plans of imposing an 80% tariff on Australian barley. The rising tensions come amid Australian PM Morrison’s surprising call for an independent international investigation into the origins of the pandemic in China. Australian Trade Minister Birmingham believes Australian meat exports are having minor technical breaches with China, while he sees the suspension as unrelated to coronavirus inquiry and added that there should be a thorough investigation regarding the coronavirus. China's Foreign Ministry also said China's suspension of beef imports from Australia are not linked to the investigations into the pandemic's origin.</p><p><strong>WHY THIS MATTERS:</strong> China is Australia’s largest trading partner. China accounts for around 35% of Australian beef exports (AUD 5bln of exports p/a) and is also Australia’s largest market for barley (around 70% of exports between 2015-18). The tariff increases on barley coupled with the suspension of red meat imports (the four abattoirs process over 1/5th of Aussie beef export to China) would present significant impacts on producers alongside GDP.</p><p><strong>WHAT’S NEXT:</strong> The tariffs themselves would be a result of a 2018 anti-dumping investigation, initiated by China into barley exported from Australia. At the start of the investigation, China’s barley industry proposed anti-dumping tariffs of just over 56%, which was then raised to 73.6%. The Australian government has been given 10 days from 11th May to respond, whilst China is to finalise its investigation by May 19th. In terms of the suspension of abattoirs, The Australian Trade Minister downplayed the issue and believes the two sides can resolve the issue, albeit some believe this could be a threat of potential Chinese boycott.</p><p><strong>WHAT CAN AUSTRALIA DO?:</strong></p><ul><li>Australia can challenge the barley tariffs using the WTO dispute mechanism – but this would take years to process. Desks note that even if Australia wins the dispute, China can open a reinvestigation that could maintain the original decision.</li><li>Others say Australia could mull gradual relaxation of travel restrictions on China – another sticking point in relations.</li><li>Aussie press notes that Australia’s 5G position should be revised and instead focus on risks associated with 5G equipment as opposed to the 5G nationality – which would signal a strong will to repair the relationship.</li></ul>",

However, the psychological -50 bp cash yield may yet prove more difficult to overcome ahead of looming issuance, especially after an unusually strong Bobl auction last time out and EU equities seen opening on the back foot amidst the ongoing COVID-19 vigil that is keeping broad risk sentiment volatile. Back to Bunds, the big figure is just holding for now within a 173.36-01 range vs yesterday’s 173.53 close, while the periphery is holding up better even though Austria’s Finance Minister has reiterated his opposition against joint debt as a means to help the likes of Italy pay for crisis measures.</p>",

(-0.6%)</strong> were also lacklustre due to the increased trade concerns surrounding China but with downside in the mainland cushioned by recent stronger than expected lending data. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher after prices found support around 152.15 and amid the cautious tone in stocks, while the gains also coincided with a rebound in T-notes from the losses in the prior session that were partly triggered by heavy supply and following mostly better received 10yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net neutral on the day.

(FT)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> extended on gains above the 100.00 level as it benefitted from the cautiousness triggered by the calls from China to renegotiate the trade agreement and following comments from Fed speakers in which Fed’s Bostic and Fed’s Evans both spoke against the idea of negative rates for the US. The gains in the greenback weighed on its transatlantic peers which dragged <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly below the 1.0800 and 1.2300 handles respectively, with Brexit uncertainty adding to the woes as UK negotiators will reportedly tell the EU that a new fisheries agreement cannot be part of a free trade agreement. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were dampened by the cautious sentiment which also weighed on the risk-sensitive antipodean currencies, with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> further pressured by the deteriorating Sino-Aussie ties, softer Chinese CPI data and weak Australian Business Confidence.</p><p>China imposed an import ban on 4 Australian abattoirs. There were later comments from the Australia Trade Minister Birmingham that he believes Australian meat exports are having minor technical breaches with China and should be able to resolve the issues, while he sees the suspension as unrelated to coronavirus inquiry and added that there should be a thorough investigation regarding the coronavirus.

(Newswires) Australian NAB Business Conditions (Apr) -34 (Prev. -21)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> crude futures took a breather after the price fluctuation seen yesterday upon the announcement of an additional 1mln bpd voluntary cut by Saudi and with UAE and Kuwait also joining in with a respective 100k bpd and 80k bpd additional reductions on top of their OPEC+ commitments. Nonetheless, the gains were short-lived as markets eventually viewed the cuts as underwhelming given the large drop in the demand and as reports last month had touted a potential 2mln bpd of additional cuts. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were flat with price action contained around the USD 1700/oz level and <strong>copper</strong> was also kept subdued due to the cautious risk tone triggered by the resurfacing of trade concerns.</p><p>Saudi Arabia said the additional cuts in output are designed to support rebalancing the market and encourages other producers to make further voluntary cuts, while they would be more than surprised if by the next OPEC+ meeting in June the picture is not brighter. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX sold off on Monday amid a chunky supply pipeline and strength in equities. Yields had been heading modestly lower in European trade as equity futures reversed their strength set at the open on Sunday, however, a pick-up in equities, led by the NQ, saw duration come under pressure. Furthermore, participants had, and still have, a slew of supply to digest this week, where the US sold USD 42bln of three-year notes as part of its refunding today (stopped through the 0.233% WI by 0.3bps, covered 2.54x and Dealers took 32.59%). At the same time, the Dollar corporate issuance continued to churn post Q1 earnings, with today’s big deals pricing include Disney’s USD 11bln six-trancher and PayPal’s USD 4bln four-trancher. By settlement, yields were up between 3-6bps (3 on the short-end, 6 on the long-end) and the curve had bear-steepened. US T-note futures (M0) settled 10+ ticks lower at 138-20.</p><p><strong>NY Fed said the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will begin purchases of ETFs today which may purchase US-listed ETFs</strong> whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for US corporate bonds, Furthermore, it added the majority of ETF holdings will be on those focused on exposure to US investment grade corporate bonds and remaining will be those with primary exposure to US high-yield corporate bonds. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed’s Quarles (voter, hawk)</strong> said banks are well-positioned to be a source of strength not strain in the current crisis, while he reiterated the view from other members that the Fed may be required to do more before the end of the crisis. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bostic (non-voter, dov</strong>e) said he is not a \"big fan\" of negative rates and considers it among the weaker tools in the tool kit, while he does not believe the Fed would be inclined to buy equities. Bostic added that inflation could come one day, but not in the next six to twelve months and that the Fed would respond \"accordingly\" if it were to come. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Evans (non-voter, dove)</strong> said he does not anticipate negative rates would be used as a tool in the US but sees rates near zero for quite some time. Evans added that a return-to-growth scenario in H2 2020 is only \"a bit\" more likely than the more pessimistic scenarios and added that while there is evidence that recent monetary and fiscal policy is cushioning the blow, more stimulus will be needed.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade cautious following the indecisive performance of their Wall St peers as US-China trade concerns resurfaced after reports of some Chinese officials were calling for new negotiations on the Phase One trade deal and may consider invalidating the agreement, with President Trump later noting he was not interested in renegotiating. ASX 200 (-1.5%) suffers broad losses with defensives such as healthcare and consumer staples the only sectors to weather the slump, while weak business confidence and escalating tensions with China added to the glum after Australia’s largest trading partner imposed an import ban on 4 Australian abattoirs which is seen to be retaliation for PM Morrison’s calls for an independent inquiry to the coronavirus outbreak. Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) was subdued by unfavourable currency flows but with losses stemmed amid earnings releases which have so far mostly been from mid-cap names ahead of results from automakers Toyota and Honda. Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are also lacklustre due to the increased trade concerns surrounding China but with downside in the mainland cushioned by recent stronger than expected lending data.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY extends on gains above the 100.00 level as it benefits from the cautiousness triggered by the calls from China to renegotiate the trade agreement and following comments from Fed speakers in which Fed’s Bostic and Fed’s Evans both spoke against the idea of negative rates for the US. The gains in the greenback weighed on its transatlantic peers which dragged EUR/USD below 1.0800 and pressured GBP/USD to briefly give up the 1.2300 handle, with Brexit uncertainty adding to the woes as UK negotiators will reportedly tell the EU that a new fisheries agreement cannot be part of a free trade agreement. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are dampened by the cautious sentiment which has pressured the risk-sensitive antipodean currencies, with AUD/USD also dragged by the deteriorating Sino-Aussie ties, softer Chinese CPI data and weak Australian Business Confidence.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher after prices found support around 152.15 and amid the cautious tone in stocks, while the gains also coincided with a rebound in T-notes from the losses in the prior session that were partly triggered by heavy supply. Nonetheless, the gains in benchmark JGBs are only marginal with participants now awaiting the results from this month 10yr auction due later.&nbsp;</p>",
