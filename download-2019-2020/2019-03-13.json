Brexit Amendment A was also accepted by 312 for vs. 308 (margin of 4) which rejects the UK leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship, removing any reference to the default position of a no-deal Brexit, while the “Malthouse Plan B” Amendment F was rejected by 164 for vs. 374 against (margin of 210), which ITV's Political Editor Peston suggested shows remainers are taking hold of Brexit. (Newswires)</p><p>UK PM May said the house has provided a clear majority against leaving without a deal and the onus is now on us in the house to find a solution, while the legal default position remains that UK will leave without a deal unless something else is agreed. PM May further commented that the options remain the same in which we could have a second referendum but that would risk no Brexit at all and that the EU has been clear this is the only deal available, while she adds that without getting a consensus on a deal in the coming days there will need to be a longer extension which would require the UK to take part in EU elections. (Newswires)</p><p>UK House Speaker said Government extension motion for tomorrow proposes extension until June 30th. In related news, there were earlier reports that Government Officials are making contingency plans for European Elections if Brexit is delayed according to the Guardian’s Political Correspondent. (Newswires/Guardian)</p><p>Some ERG MPs are reportedly saying they will support PM May's deal in a 3rd meaningful vote on the condition PM May resigns, according to BuzzFeed senior political correspondent Wickham, although ERG's Baker said we will keep voting down UK PM May's deal and ERG’s Francois also said he would not back PM May’s deal. UK PM May office said PM May is not mulling resigning and that the default position remains that the UK is to leave the EU on 29 March.

Take-Two (TTWO) surged following takeover chatter; competitors Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) also traded higher. AT&amp;T (T) announced plans to slash several channels from its DirecTV Now packs, channels from competitors including Viacom (VIAB) and Discovery (DISCA), which both nosedived; CBS (CBS) also underperformed. Carnival (CCL) pushed higher after an upgrade at Goldman. General Dynamics (GD) drifted higher, supported a USD 500mln IT contract. Boeing (BA) and Southwest (LUV) sold off further after President Trump ordered the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets in the US. Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) helped rise the tech sector in what was a risk on day. SPX +0.70% at 2811, NDX +0.77% at 7257, DJI +0.58% at 25703.</p><p>Treasury futures were in the red as US traders got to their desks in the morning’s risk on sentiment but pared back losses as the session progressed. The T-plex got off on a downward path as CTAs and real money reportedly pared long positions in the front-end through the belly while the leveraged accounts weighed down the long-end. The long-end of the curve sold off going into the Treasury auction for USD 16bln of 30-yr bonds today, which saw a high yield of 3.014%, the lowest yield since July last year and tailing the WI by 0.8bps. Domestic demand was a little disappointing with directs taking a small share and dealers taking a large share, although indirects took a fair chunk too. Going into settlement, there was steepening across the curve with the front-to-long end being the most pronounced, 2s/30s widened by 1.8bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled half a tick lower at 122-27+.</p>",

        "subject": "FX ANALYSIS: GBP higher after lawmakers vote against no deal Brexit (GBP, USD, BRL, AUD, NZD)",
        "content": "<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Brexit negotiations took a strong turn against no-deal as the amended UK Government motion rejecting a no-deal was accepted by a margin of 43. This had a tumultuous voting session which saw the Govt. turn on their heels in the final vote and whip MPs to vote against their original proposition so as to keep a no-deal on the table after the narrow acceptance of amendment A. This saw some marginal upside for the GBP due to the vehement rejection of a no-deal increasing the likelihood of a softer exit, but these moves were faded immediately as resignations were abound following the Government’s insistence of whipping its MPs against their will. Also, whilst the motion acceptances provide intentions of the house, it does not legally bind the UK to avoid a no-deal, and this was also judged to have added to the pressure to Sterling, and kept GBP confined within a tight range throughout the voting period around 1.3250. As such, the upcoming votes on Thursday on an extension to the Brexit timeframe become more pivotal due to the necessity to negotiate further on the current deal, as do the responses from the EU on a request for an extension should this come to pass (as is expected). For analysts at ING, this timeframe extension increases the likelihood of a softer Brexit as it would allow for more time for negotiation with the EU, assuming acceptance from the EU side should the rationale be judged as “convincingly justified”. UK PM May spoke in the fallout of the voting and stated that a short limited technical extension is the Govts. intention, whilst also stating that the responsibility falls on the Govt. to find a solution within this period to avoid a no-deal.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Dollar Index is on course to print the fourth day of losses. The folks at HSBC reiterated that they remain long the USD vs the CAD and AUD, arguing that the dollar could benefit as fresh doubts surface over global trade. The bank adds that with G10 FX volatility low, and central banks on hold, the USD's attractive yield level will likely be a dominant driver (one-year yields around 2.5%). \"If G10 central banks have manoeuvred themselves into a position of policy inaction for the foreseeable future, the relative level of interest rates matters more than ever,\" HSBC says, \"markets, so often fixated on the likely change in rate expectations, instead have to focus on the level of yield on offer.\" The bank also notes that low historical volatility across most G10 pairings reinforces the allure of the USD's positive carry, and while it is \"true, the USD cannot match the yield offerings from segments of EMFX, but within G10 FX, the USD provides an unusual combination of high yield and safe haven characteristics.\"</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The Brazilian real was hit after industrial production data surprised to the downside. This was a weak report, and the underlying trend is weakening, some desks noted. The report also suggests that Q1 could be challenging for the Brazilian economy, and will ramp up pressure on new President Bolsonaro to press ahead with reforms to boost the economy. However, there does seem to be some optimism, signalled by the survey data, as well as improvements in some of the hard economic data. More immediately, attention now moves on to Friday, when the government plans to auction 12 airports, followed by railroads and other ports later in the month. Some analysts note that a successful auction will bolster new President Bolsonaro's pro business credentials, supporting the BRL.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Overnight, the data continued to paint a picture of an Aussie economy which is facing challenges. This time, consumer confidence fell by around 5 points to 98.8, offsetting February's 4.2 point rise, and now signalling a downtrend which started in the middle of last year. \"That fits with other data we've seen that suggests the Australian economy was strong in H1 2018, and has been slowing since,\" UBS writes, \"The level remains okay, and better than the recent trend in retail sales.\" However, the bank notes that the outlook is shifting bearish, pointing out that the largest declines in the survey were for the forward-looking components: family finances one-year ahead -6.4pts to 101.4, economy one-year ahead -7.1pts to 95.9, economy five-years ahead -5.6pts to 94.6, while 'time to buy a major household item' -0.7pts to 117.9.</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> The other Antipode saw its own soft economic data, with NZ housing transactions falling at a rate of 9.5% YY in Feb. \"This isn't the entire story, though,\" UBS said, \"Both the New Zealand and New Zealand ex-Auckland house price indices rose 1.6% m/m, taking both series to a new all-time high. Prices are at a record high in eight of the 12 New Zealand regions.\" Part of the reason for price pressure, the data-compiler explained, was the decline of inventories, and that will continue to be a concern for the industry, with the ongoing pressure on inventory set to result in price increases in these regions.</p>",

UK PM May spoke in the fallout of the voting and stated that a short limited technical extension is the Govts. intention, whilst also stating that the responsibility falls on the Govt. to find a solution within this period to avoid a no-deal.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>As time presses on and still little clarity given on the timing of a US-China trade summit or deal, US President Trump said on Wednesday afternoon that there is a very good chance there will be a deal, although he is in no rush, but it is going along very nicely. He added that it does not matter whether a deal is made at or before a summit, previously guided to be in Mar-A-Lago at the end of March or early April; Trump also warned that China President Xi has seen that he can walk away from deals.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS: </strong>January durable goods orders saw a 0.4% increase, against the expected decrease of 0.4%, but still a cooling from December’s 1.2% rise, with net revision to the headline orders figure rising 0.1%. “Headline orders were boosted by a third straight increase in the civilian aircraft component, which offset a dip in the autos component. Aircraft orders are volatile and now stand at the top of their recent range, so they likely will be a drag on the headline number over the next couple of months”, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics note, after breaking down the sub figures where orders ex-transportation decreased by 0.1%, compared to the expected 0.1% rise, helped by the orders for non-defence capital goods, ex aircraft figure rising by 0.8%. “Core capex orders fell at a 5.3% annualized rate in the three months to January, compared to the previous three months, the worst performance since mid-2016. The dramatic weakening in Chinese manufacturing import orders points to sustained further declines ahead.”</p><p><strong>* US CONSTRUCTION SPENDING:</strong> US construction spending rose by 1.3% in January, the largest monthly gain seen in nine-months. Construction spending started 2019 on a firm footing, Wells Fargo said, with outlays for commercial projects and highway road works leading the way. Milder than usual weather appears to have boosted construction activity in January, Wells says, adding that the recent jobs data confirm the jump in highway work in January, but winter returned with a vengeance in February and reversed those gains, suggesting we will see outlays fall back next month.</p><p><strong>* US PPI: </strong>February’s producer price index rose by 0.1%, in both the headline and the ex-food/energy figure, both just shy of their expected 0.2% rise. Analysts at Pantheon Economics highlight, “The core was held down by a 0.4% dip in the trade services component, which measures retail and wholesale profit margins and accounts for 31% of the index. It’s volatile, and the Feb decline followed a 0.8% Jan jump.” Pantheon notes that the “culprit” is the more ominous China PPI figures, which is seeping through to the US.</p><p><strong>* UK BUDGET: </strong>There was no major departure from UK Chancellor Hammond's fiscal plans, which still point to stimulus injections in 2019/20. While the OBR forecasts were more or less unchanged, there was a significant cut to immediate growth forecasts (2019 cut to 1.2% vs 1.6%), though desks point out that the cumulative growth profile over the next five years remains unchanged. There was a lowering of expectation of public sector net borrowing in the fiscal year (GBP 29.3bln vs GBP 31.8bln), and the cumulative profile over through 2023 was trimmed by around GBP 30bln, taking it to GBP 119bln, which reflects an upward revision to the forecast for income tax receipts and a reduction in the forecast for debt interest payments, following the recent fall in UK yields, Pantheon Macroeconomics said.</p><p><strong>* GILT ISSUANCE: </strong>UK Gilt issuance to rise in 2019/20, but net issuance will be at the lowest in 16 years. Gross gilt issuance in FY19/20 will be £114.1bn with a further £4.0bn contribution from bill sales. Gilt issuance&nbsp; for FY19/20 is broken down as follows: Shorts: GBP 29.4bn (10 auctions), Mediums: GBP 24.8bn (9 auctions), Longs: GBP 17.8bn (8 auctions) + GBP 13bn via syndications (3 operations), Index-linked: GBP 13.8bn (10 auctions) + GBP 8.0bn via syndications (2 operations), GBP 7.3bn unallocated issuance. Barclays says that while the growth forecast for 2019 is now lower (1.2% YY vs 1.6% in October), growth for 2021-2023 has been revised higher by 0.2ppts to 1.6% YY. \"By the end of the forecast period, headline PSNBx is GBP 13.5bln (0.5% GDP), some GBP 6.3bln lower than the Autumn 2018 Budget,\" and that \"cumulatively, the PSNBx forecast is GBP 25.9bn lower than the profile published at the Autumn Budget.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLED USD 1.39 HIGHER AT USD 58.26/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.88 HIGHER AT USD 67.55/BBL. </strong>The energy complex marched higher on Wednesday, fuelled primarily by bullish inventory data. Prices got off to a strong foot overnight and into the morning on the back of the API printing a surprise draw of 2.6mln bbls in crude stocks; RBOB futures also surged on API printing a larger than expected draw of 5.8mln bbls, a second consecutive week of large draws. A second wind was felt on Wednesday’s official DOE inventory data which recorded crude stocks drawing 3.9mln bbls, compared to the expected 2.7mln bbl build and a larger build than the API recorded; Cushing recorded a surprise draw of 0.67mln bbls; gasoline drew larger than expected at 4.6mln bbls; distillates was the only build at 0.38mln bbls, a 1.8mln bbls draw was expected; US crude production ticked down from record highs to 12mln BPD. Other factors underpinning the gains include, “the latest evidence that Russia is moving toward its OPEC+ production target, Saudi Arabian determination to hold output even below its official allocation, uncertainty over Venezuela’s ability to maintain output, and US determination “punish bad actors,” at least some of whom produce crude oil”, Citi analysts note. Elsewhere, PVM analysts highlighted, “adding to the upswing in buying pressures is belligerent rhetoric from Iran. The OPEC nation warned of a tough response if Israel’s navy acted against its oil shipments. This came as the US ally threatened to combat alleged clandestine measures used by Iran to ship its oil.”</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.70% at 2811, NDX +0.77% at 7257, DJI +0.58% at 25703.

Carnival (CCL) pushed higher after an upgrade at Goldman. General Dynamics (GD) drifted higher, supported a USD 500mln IT contract. Boeing (BA) and Southwest (LUV) sold off further after President Trump ordered the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets in the US. Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) helped rise the tech sector in what was a risk on day.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED HALF A TICK LOWER AT 122-27+. </strong>Treasury futures were in the red as US traders got to their desks in the morning’s risk on sentiment but pared back losses as the session progressed. The T-plex got off on a downward path as CTAs and real money reportedly pared long positions in the front-end through the belly while the leveraged accounts weighed down the long-end. The long-end of the curve sold off going into the Treasury auction,<strong> </strong>where the US Treasury sold USD 16bln of 30-yr bonds today, which saw a high yield of 3.014%, the lowest yield since July last year and tailing the WI by 0.8bps. Domestic demand was a little disappointing with directs taking a small share and dealers taking a large share, although indirects took a fair chunk too. Going into settlement, there was steepening across the curve with the front-to-long end being the most pronounced, 2s/30s widened by 1.8bps.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Dollar Index is on course to print the fourth day of losses. The folks at HSBC reiterated that they remain long the USD vs the CAD and AUD, arguing that the dollar could benefit as fresh doubts surface over global trade. The bank adds that with G10 FX volatility low, and central banks on hold, the USD's attractive yield level will likely be a dominant driver (one-year yields around 2.5%). \"If G10 central banks have manoeuvred themselves into a position of policy inaction for the foreseeable future, the relative level of interest rates matters more than ever,\" HSBC says, \"markets, so often fixated on the likely change in rate expectations, instead have to focus on the level of yield on offer.\" The bank also notes that low historical volatility across most G10 pairings reinforces the allure of the USD's positive carry, and while it is \"true, the USD cannot match the yield offerings from segments of EMFX, but within G10 FX, the USD provides an unusual combination of high yield and safe haven characteristics.\"</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The Brazilian real was hit after industrial production data surprised to the downside. This was a weak report, and the underlying trend is weakening, some desks noted. The report also suggests that Q1 could be challenging for the Brazilian economy, and will ramp up pressure on new President Bolsonaro to press ahead with reforms to boost the economy. However, there does seem to be some optimism, signalled by the survey data, as well as improvements in some of the hard economic data. More immediately, attention now moves on to Friday, when the government plans to auction 12 airports, followed by railroads and other ports later in the month. Some analysts note that a successful auction will bolster new President Bolsonaro's pro business credentials, supporting the BRL.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Overnight, the data continued to paint a picture of an Aussie economy which is facing challenges. This time, consumer confidence fell by around 5 points to 98.8, offsetting February's 4.2 point rise, and now signalling a downtrend which started in the middle of last year. \"That fits with other data we've seen that suggests the Australian economy was strong in H1 2018, and has been slowing since,\" UBS writes, \"The level remains okay, and better than the recent trend in retail sales.\" However, the bank notes that the outlook is shifting bearish, pointing out that the largest declines in the survey were for the forward-looking components: family finances one-year ahead -6.4pts to 101.4, economy one-year ahead -7.1pts to 95.9, economy five-years ahead -5.6pts to 94.6, while 'time to buy a major household item' -0.7pts to 117.9.</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> The other Antipode saw its own soft economic data, with NZ housing transactions falling at a rate of 9.5% YY in Feb. \"This isn't the entire story, though,\" UBS said, \"Both the New Zealand and New Zealand ex-Auckland house price indices rose 1.6% m/m, taking both series to a new all-time high. Prices are at a record high in eight of the 12 New Zealand regions.\" Part of the reason for price pressure, the data-compiler explained, was the decline of inventories, and that will continue to be a concern for the industry, with the ongoing pressure on inventory set to result in price increases in these regions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

NOTE: this vote would not change anything unless a subsequent decision was taken -- such as extending the Article 50 process on Thursday, and that being agreed to by all EU members, likely on 21 March -- merely stating that a no-deal Brexit is an undesirable outcome is not sufficient in avoiding that scenario</p><p><strong>* SCHEDULE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1900 GMT (1500 EDT/2000 CET) - Vote on selected amendments (A &amp; F)</p><p>1945-2030 GMT (1545-1630 EDT/2045-2130 CET) - Vote on the no-deal motion</p><p><strong>* AMENDMENTS TO TODAY'S VOTE:</strong></p><p><strong>(A) COOPER-BOLES-LETWIN-SPELMAN-DROMEY</strong>: <i>Rejects the UK leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship, removing any reference to the default position of a no-deal Brexit. </i>In January, Spelman and Dromey tabled another amendment ruling out no-deal back which was passed by the Common, hence there is a majority in favour of it. It is worth noting, however, that Caroline Spelman will not be supporting her own amendment, and sources have suggested that the Government is looking for her to pull it as they fear having to sack Tory party members should they defy the Governments whip on votes. This was later confirmed in the House as an attempt was made by Spelman to pull her amendment, but this was stopped by the Speaker as this would require approval by all signatories. Thus, Zeffman of The Times believes there is \"less likely majority for it\" –<i> <strong>LIKELINESS OF PASSING FALLING AFTER SPELMAN'S ATTEMPTED PULL </strong></i><strong>[FREE VOTE NOT ALLOWED]</strong></p><p><strong>(F)</strong> <strong>MALTHOUSE (DODDS-MOGG-MORGAN-GREEN-IDS)</strong>: <i>Proposes the government to take steps to minimise no deal disruptions by publishing Day One Tariff Schedule immediately. Extend Article 50 to 22:59 GMT May 22nd, and standstill agreement with the EU until December 30th, 2021. Government should unilaterally guarantee rights of EU citizens in the UK</i>. – <i><strong>LESS LIKELY TO PASS &nbsp;</strong></i><strong>[FREE VOTE ALLOWED]</strong></p><p><strong>* WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:</strong> If the motion passes, as it is expected to do, focus then shifts onto Thursday's vote on extending the Article 50 process. It remains unclear how long this extension would be for (see below). However, European policymakers have been clear that there should be a convincing justification for any delay. It is likely that EU members would vote to approve any extension at next week's summit (29 March). A memo reportedly says EU is to advise that extending Article 50 only makes sense in 3 scenarios: 1) to prepare for no deal, 2) complete ratification of a deal, or 3) if the UK decides to hold an election or referendum.</p><p><strong>* POSSIBLE ARTICLE 50 EXTENSION</strong> – 18/APR? 23/MAY? 23/Jun?/or beyond: As things stand, if MPs vote to extend the Article 50 process, in addition to the UK’s approval, every EU member would be required to agree. The message from the EU has been mixed; while some think it is a sensible idea, others say the process should only be extended if there is a good reason for it. Assuming that the EU agrees, the process could be pushed from the UK’s current Brexit leave date 29 March, to 18 April – the last day that the European Parliament can vote before breaking up ahead of May’s elections; the European Parliament has yet to even debate the Brexit deal, and has therefore not yet voted on it. It is likely, however, that if the UK votes for what is available, EU lawmakers will likely follow suit. The current exit date is enshrined into UK law, and that would need to be changed; BBC says a push to 23 May has emerged as a possible new Brexit day to allow the UK two months to fully prepare itself for leaving, and this would also mean the UK departs ahead of the 23-26 May European Parliament elections. IF no agreement between the UK and EU on the backstop is seen, a longer delay to exit becomes possible. A push to the end of June – 23rd is capturing imaginations since it would coincide with the Brexit referendum anniversary – would be an admission that more time is needed, though new MEPs take their place in Parliament in early July, suggesting that nothing could be voted on until then at the very earliest, a scenario that will not be ideal for either UK or EU. If the process cannot be wrapped up by July, then scenarios of 2021 come into focus (EU officials are said to have mulled a delay until then, BBC reported), though this may not be palatable for Brexiteers, and thus, may split the government and lead to another strategy before then.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The energy complex marched higher on Wednesday, fuelled primarily by bullish inventory data. Prices got off to a strong foot overnight and into the morning on the back of the API printing a surprise draw of 2.6mln bbls in crude stocks; RBOB futures also surged on API printing a larger than expected draw of 5.8mln bbls, a second consecutive week of large draws. A second wind was felt on Wednesday’s official DOE inventory data which recorded crude stocks drawing 3.9mln bbls, compared to the expected 2.7mln bbl build and a larger build than the API recorded; Cushing recorded a surprise draw of 0.67mln bbls; gasoline drew larger than expected at 4.6mln bbls; distillates was the only build at 0.38mln bbls, a 1.8mln bbls draw was expected; US crude production ticked down from record highs to 12mln BPD. Other factors underpinning the gains include, “the latest evidence that Russia is moving toward its OPEC+ production target, Saudi Arabian determination to hold output even below its official allocation, uncertainty over Venezuela’s ability to maintain output, and US determination “punish bad actors,” at least some of whom produce crude oil”, Citi analysts note. Elsewhere, PVM analysts highlighted, “adding to the upswing in buying pressures is belligerent rhetoric from Iran. The OPEC nation warned of a tough response if Israel’s navy acted against its oil shipments. This came as the US ally threatened to combat alleged clandestine measures used by Iran to ship its oil.”</p>",

No Fed add-ons.</p><p><strong>* RECENT PERFORMANCE:</strong> The uncertain outlook, risk asset jitters, and the prospect of no Fed hikes on the horizon has supported front-end of the Treasury curve recently; the market prices no hikes this year, with pricing tilting towards cuts in 2020. TD Securities expects this week’s auctions to go well given their expectation for no further coupon auction size increases ahead, and the fact that rates have remained relatively stable.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION (USD 16bln, Wednesday 1300 EDT/1700 GMT): </strong>The previous 30-year auction in February stopped on the screws, with cover in-line with recent averages. The recent steepening of the curve might provide some support for the auction, analysts said. Foreign investors’ participation was higher (10% vs 4% at the January auction), and domestic participation slipped to 61% from the record high of 67%. “However, looking through the month-to-month volatility, domestic investors accounted for 63% over the past three months, versus 60% over the past year,” Barclays points out, adding that “On-the-run 30s are trading at a liquidity discount to old 30s (Nov 2048) in the forward space, which we think is justified, given that the latter is a CTD in deferred WN contracts.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/2bddc465-2de8-4a8a-b9a4-a2311d50fca7.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The DXY is now just off a fresh session low of 97.713 and in danger of a deeper pull-back from recent 97.000+ highs having crosses another Fib support (96.764 – represents 50% of a prior move from 97.711-95.817), with the next downside chart level just above 96.500 at the 30 DMA (96.584).</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound seems almost impervious to any set-backs or potentially negative Brexit developments, as Cable retained a firm bid and extended gains beyond 1.3100 to 1.3200+ after another one-sided vote to reject UK PM May’s WA, with EU add-ons. Similarly, Eur/Gbp nudged through the bottom of a 0.8645-0.8570 range towards 0.8560 in the face of a relatively strong single currency vs the Buck, as attention turned to the 2nd of a possible (if not probable) 3 consecutive Parliamentary votes, and this time on the issue of no deal, alongside amendments (A and F selected by the Speaker). The decision whether to back or oppose the motions will determine whether the final vote goes ahead on Thursday and that centres on going back to the EU to request an Article 50 extension. Note, for a more detailed and up to date summary of the situation please check our headline feed.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Loonie is vying with the Scandi Crowns to claim next best G10 currency after Sterling, and a more pronounced rebound in oil prices has fuelled the Cad and Nok rally to circa 1.3310 cs the Usd and 9.7070 against the Eur respectively. However, the Sek tagged along and recovered from early wobbles following moderately softer Swedish inflation expectations via the latest Prospera survey with the Eur cross down to around 10.5280 from just over 10.5800.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the single currency also benefited from broad Dollar weakness and after clearing some upside chart obstacles ahead of 1.1300 (including the 200 HMA and 10 DMA at 1.1290 and 1.1294) the headline pair hit the NY cut right on option expiries from 1.1300-10 in 2.1 bn before eclipsing yesterday’s session peak and then touching the 21 DMA at 1.1313.</p><p><strong>JPY/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Ending Wednesday’s EU session as the major laggards as Usd/Jpy hovers just below a new recent range high of 111.45 or so, while Aud/Usd meanders between 0.7082-50 following the latest in a long line of bleak macro releases (Westpac consumer sentiment overnight). However, the Kiwi is underperforming in the run up to NZ Q4 GDP next week, with Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6850 and the cross looking firmer having rebounded from just below 1.0300.</p>",

Sectors are mixed, with outperformance seen in energy names as the oil complex is higher by around 0.8%. Notable movers include, Stoxx 600 heavyweight Nestle (+0.4%) in the green after the Co. are said to have selected second round bidders for their skin care unit, which may be valued as high as USD 10bln. Separately, and towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are Pandora (+1.5%) as the Co. are to initiate preparations to identify a new chairman at their annual general meeting today. Elsewhere, and lagging the Stoxx 600 are Inditex (-4.0%) as their FY figures missed on some analysts’ expectations, and in spite of the Co. lifting their dividend by 17%. Adidas (-3.9%) are similarly underperforming as the Co. expect H1 to be impacted by supply chain problems, particularly in the US, may have a 1-2% impact on 2019 sales growth. Finally, Wirecard (-4.9</p><p>On the pre-market front Spotify (SPOT) have filed a complaint against Apple (AAPL) stating that Apple abuses its market dominance and engages in anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - Sterling continues to withstand Brexit-related bearish impulses/knocks and has staged another impressive looking comeback from lows vs the Usd and Eur in wake of a 2nd big defeat for UK PM May on the Withdrawal Agreement, even with legally binding assurances from the EU. In fact, the Pound sits proud at the top of the G10 rankings with Cable back above 1.3100 and briefly through technical resistance in the form of a 50% Fib (1.3148) and the psychological 1.3150 level, while Eur/Gbp has reversed from circa 0.8650 through 0.8600 again.</p><p>DXY - The broad Dollar and index remain on the back foot following yesterday’s benign US CPI release, as the data focus switches to PPI, durable goods and construction spending, while the Gbp resilience noted above along with similar resistance in other rival currencies is also impacting. The DXY has subsequently slipped back from 97.000+ yet again and is currently just off a 96.839 base, eyeing chart support at 96.764 (also a 50% retracement) having breached 96.987 (38.2% Fib).</p><p>CAD/AUD/NZD - The non-US Dollars are bucking the overall trend of gains vs the Greenback, albeit to varying degrees as the Loonie continues to hold up better around 1.3350 against the backdrop of firmer crude prices. Conversely, the Aussie and Kiwi are underperforming, with Aud/Usd slipping back towards 0.7050 following downbeat Westpac consumer sentiment overnight, and Nzd/Usd retreating through 0.6850 ahead of NZ GDP data that may miss consensus and the RBNZ’s forecast, according to Westpac. However, the Aud/Nzd cross remains weak after a sub-1.0300 dip at one stage.</p><p>CHF/EUR/JPY - The Franc has marginally extended recovery gains vs the Dollar to just shy of 1.0050, while the single currency has crossed 1.1300 with the aid of firmer than expected Eurozone IP and bullish near term technical impulses as the headline pair clears 200 hourly a 10 daily MAs (1.1290 and 1.1294 respectively). However, Tuesday’s 1.1305 peak remains (just) intact and the 21 DMA comes in at 1.1313, while decent expiry options sit between 1.1300-10 (2.1 bn). The Jpy has been hampered somewhat by disappointing Japanese data in the form of machinery orders and is currently close to the bottom of a 111.15-38 band.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Supply and data may have been catalysts or at least valid rational for a bit more downside in debt futures, while Gilts may have noted vague talk about Cox having more in his legal capacity to convey on the revised WA that could yet coral support for UK PM May’s deal. Regardless, core bonds and Italian BTPs have extended losses and recoiled a little further from best levels with Bunds down to 164.39 (-15 ticks vs +14 ticks at one stage), the 10 year UK benchmark at 127.10 (-21 ticks vs +2 ticks fleetingly) and the latter trying to regroup after a retreat to 128.41 from 128.88 vs yesterday’s 128.80 close. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are just off new overnight session troughs, and with the curve steeper into long bond issuance, PPI, durable goods and construction spending data.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>WTI and Brent futures are marginally firmer on the day but remain in within the March range of just over USD 3.0/bbl. WTI futures are approaching the March high of USD 57.86/bbl whilst Brent is also around USD 0.50 from this month’s highs. In terms of production numbers, Russia oil output has reportedly fallen to 11.307mln vs. 11.336mln in February. As a reminder, under the OPEC+ deal, Russia agreed to curb output by 228K BPD in Q1 2019 from the October baseline of 11.418mln. Traders will be eyeing the release of the weekly DoE inventory data which will be released at 1430GMT due to the US clock change.</p><p>Metals markets are higher across the board as the complex benefits from the pullback in the Greenback. Gold hit a two week high and reclaimed USD 1300/oz to the upside whilst breaching its 50 DMA at USD 1303/oz whilst copper gains more ground above its 100 WMA (USD 2.8993/lb). Finally, zinc prices hit levels last seen eight months ago (USD 2848.50/tonne) as concern grows about an tight market for the metal.</p><p>Kazakhstan is committed to produce 1.860mln BPD of oil under the Global Oil Prodction deal, Feb production 1.893mln BPD vs. 1.885 in Jan.

Nomura believes it is too early to say whether CTAs have switched to buying US equities, but we do believe they are shifting to “wait-and-see” mode to judge whether the current US stock market uptrend is sustainable.\"</li><li>Nomura also says that in addition to the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ, there are other markets where stock prices have recovered to levels above triggers or critical points to induce CTAs systematic selling, such as the Hong Kong HSI (where Nomura believes the breakeven level for CTAs existing long position is ~28,350), HSCEI index (around ~11,330 breakeven), Nikkei225 (around ~21,250).</li><li>Nomura says considers the following three factors as plausible gauges of shortterm supply/demand conditions: (1) systematic trend followers like CTAs have not built up excessive long positions in each stock market, and thus current selling pressure for cutting 'loss-making' positions has remained relatively light. (2) the deterioration of equity sentiment globally was short-lived, as there is shortage of negative headlines/drivers based on fundamentals. (3) risk parity investors may have mechanically increased their portfolio leverage ratio since the volatility of each major asset class has been subdued.</li><li>On the second point, the bank had estimated that its global equity market sentiment index has risen out of negative territory and was at +0.6 points as of yesterday. \"Some on the Street believe that the US retail sales data released on Monday have led to a sense of security on the US economy, but a more fundamental factor could be the continued optimism over a US-China trade agreement,\" The bank says, \"bearish players must have found it difficult to sell in equity markets and likely will wait until such a premise (i.e., hope for US-China trade agreement), which has been a big driver of the risk market rally over the past few months, is no longer valid.\"</li><li>Nomura notes that the political issues are not predictable, and most hedge funds have maintained a cautious stance. \"However, some of medium- and long-term investors might have hastily started to buy global equities on dips via ETFs.\"</li></ul>",

Finally, zinc prices hit levels last seen eight months ago (USD 2848.50/tonne) as concern grows about an tight market for the metal.</p>",

In fact, the Pound sits proud at the top of the G10 rankings with Cable back above 1.3100 and briefly through technical resistance in the form of a 50% Fib (1.3148) and the psychological 1.3150 level, while Eur/Gbp has reversed from circa 0.8650 through 0.8600 again.</p><p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and index remain on the back foot following yesterday’s benign US CPI release, as the data focus switches to PPI, durable goods and construction spending, while the Gbp resilience noted above along with similar resistance in other rival currencies is also impacting. The DXY has subsequently slipped back from 97.000+ yet again and is currently just off a 96.839 base, eyeing chart support at 96.764 (also a 50% retracement) having breached 96.987 (38.2% Fib).</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The non-US Dollars are bucking the overall trend of gains vs the Greenback, albeit to varying degrees as the Loonie continues to hold up better around 1.3350 against the backdrop of firmer crude prices. Conversely, the Aussie and Kiwi are underperforming, with Aud/Usd slipping back towards 0.7050 following downbeat Westpac consumer sentiment overnight, and Nzd/Usd retreating through 0.6850 ahead of NZ GDP data that may miss consensus and the RBNZ’s forecast, according to Westpac. However, the Aud/Nzd cross remains weak after a sub-1.0300 dip at one stage.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>The Franc has marginally extended recovery gains vs the Dollar to just shy of 1.0050, while the single currency has crossed 1.1300 with the aid of firmer than expected Eurozone IP and bullish near term technical impulses as the headline pair clears 200 hourly a 10 daily MAs (1.1290 and 1.1294 respectively). However, Tuesday’s 1.1305 peak remains (just) intact and the 21 DMA comes in at 1.1313, while decent expiry options sit between 1.1300-10 (2.1 bn). The Jpy has been hampered somewhat by disappointing Japanese data in the form of machinery orders and is currently close to the bottom of a 111.15-38 band.</p>",

However, today’s vote on ‘no deal’ looks far more clear cut, and confirmation of that scenario being ruled by Parliament means an extension to Article 50 is likely to become a reality rather than tactical change in strategy given time elapsing before March 29 and next week’s EU Summit. The Pound certainly seems to be trading on this premise or merely dismissing any bearish impulses arising from a 2nd resounding defeat for PM May, and the 10 year debt future is on the defensive within a 127.17-33 range vs Tuesday’s 127.31 Liffe settlement in contrast to a steadier tone along the 3 month strip, so farm between 0.5 and 1.5 ticks either side of the unchanged line. In the run up to tonight’s vote, yet more headline watching and perhaps some non-Brexit independent impetus from the upcoming Budget, though like BoE policy the Chancellor’s fiscal plans are highly if not wholly contingent on the former.</p>",

Bunds opened tentatively at 164.56 vs yesterday’s 164.54 Eurex close and climbed to a high of 164.68, but have subsequently revisited near term support around 164.47 having dipped to 164.43. From a fundamental perspective, EU ip data looms along with a couple of ECB speakers and supply from Germany alongside Italy and Portugal. Back to the charts, a clear breach of 164.47 exposes 164.33-31 per technical analysis from a contact and subscriber.</p>",

Elsewhere, a spokesperson said PM May has not discussed resigning which followed reports that some Tory lawmakers were said to be mulling approaching UK PM May in a delegation to ask her to resign, while it was also reported that <strong>May will hold an emergency cabinet meeting at 0800GMT today</strong>. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p><strong>Brexiteers were considering laying down a Malthouse Plan B amendment for the no-deal motion, according to ERG’s Baker.</strong> It was then later reported that the group of UK lawmakers proposed an amendment for today’s vote that the government should seek Article 50 extension until May 22 in order to prepare for a no-deal exit and that the government should offer mutual standstill agreements with the EU for an agreed period finishing by end-2021 at the latest.

The declines in the currency began long before the parliamentary vote as the key findings from the Attorney General on the legally binding changes that PM May secured in her 11th hour dash to Strasbourg, failed to appease the ERG and DUP. Nonetheless, the actual results of the vote saw a positive knee-jerk reaction for <strong>GBP</strong> which was attributed to the implication that a cliff-edged Brexit was less likely with parliament to vote on a no-deal Brexit today and on an Article 50 extension tomorrow, although the support was only brief amid the mass uncertainty. Furthermore, MPs have already proposed amendments for today’s vote including a Malthouse Plan B amendment for the government to seek an Article 50 extension until May 22 in order to prepare for a no-deal exit and which calls for mutual standstill agreements with the EU until December-2021 at the latest, while there was also an amendment from the remain camp calling for a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out. Elsewhere, the <strong>DXY</strong> traded uneventful overnight with price action stuck at the 97.00 level as <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> flatlined, and risk-sensitive pairs were mostly dictated by the lacklustre sentiment which kept <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> pressured for most the session before finding support near Tuesday’s lows. Antipodeans were also pressured due to their high-beta characteristics with <strong>AUD</strong> dampened from another round of disappointing data, although Commerzbank is anticipating a recovery for the currency and there were also forecasts from ANZ which defied the recent dovish views as it sees the RBA on hold for this year and next.</p><p>Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence Index (Mar) 98.8 (Prev. 103.8).

Additionally, one trader noted that banks were said to be receiving in size, and corporate issuance was being swapped into floating rates, with the perception that yields will continue to fall. 10-year yields dropped beneath 2.60% - we haven't had a close beneath that level since early January.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower following the mixed lead from Wall St and after UK PM May’s Brexit deal was voted down in parliament, while soft data releases also contribute to the subdued tone. ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) declined at the open with broad weakness and poor Westpac Consumer Confidence data weighing on Australia, while the Japanese benchmark underperforms on currency effects and after a larger than expected contraction in Machine Orders. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) conform to the negative tone but with losses initially stemmed as the region digested some corporate updates with Ping An Insurance shares the biggest gainer in Hong Kong after it beat on FY earnings and announced a share repurchase.</p><p>In FX markets, GBP/USD has stabilized below 1.3100 following yesterday’s Brexit-related pandemonium in which PM May’s Brexit deal was rejected via 391 vs. 242 votes or by a 149 margin. The declines in the currency began long before the parliamentary vote as the key findings from the Attorney General on the legally binding changes PM May secured in her 11th hour dash to Strasbourg, failed to appease the ERG and DUP. Nonetheless, the actual results of the vote saw a positive knee-jerk reaction for GBP which some attributed to the implication that a cliff-edged Brexit was less likely with parliament to vote on a no-deal Brexit today and on an Article 50 extension tomorrow, although the support was only brief amid the mass uncertainty. Furthermore, MPs have already proposed amendments for today’s vote including one which stated the government should seek Article 50 extension until May 22 in order to prepare for a no-deal exit and should offer mutual standstill agreements with EU for an agreed period ending by end-2021 at the latest, as well as an amendment from the remain camp calling for a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out. Elsewhere, the DXY is uneventful overnight with price action stuck at the 97.00 level and EUR/USD is also unchanged, while risk-sensitive pairs are dictated by the lacklustre sentiment with USD/JPY pressured and AUD/USD taking a hit from another round of disappointing Australian data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track recent moves in T-notes which were lifted after soft US CPI numbers, with prices also supported on safe-haven demand and the BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 710bln of JGBs with maturities in the belly to the super long-end.</p>",
