Treasuries were little changed ahead of large issuance this week - the 2-year auction was decent on Monday - in addition to month-end rebalancing flows into the complex. The crude benchmarks edged higher, benefitting from the China-trade induced risk appetite, which meanwhile saw havens XAU and JPY fare worse. Elsewhere in FX, cable was an outperformer following weekend polls indicating a further lead for incumbent PM Johnson. The risk appetite saw the cyclical tech sector lead the pack, boosted by the semiconductors (SOX), with NVDA also surging on an upgrade at Morgan Stanley. \"Merger Monday\" was very much in play, with confirmation on the SCHW-AMTD, TIF-LVMH and MDCO-NOV deals, in addition to EBAY selling its StubHub unit. The NY Fed carried out its first term repo through year-end on Monday, which was oversubscribed as primary dealers seized the opportunity to lock in low rate financing ahead of expected year-end funding pressures. Participants now look to Fed Chair Powell's speech later on Monday evening, in addition to earnings from A, HPE, PANW.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA</strong>: Over the weekend, China said it would seek to raise penalties for IP violations and lower the thresholds for criminal punishments as a result of technology theft -- seemingly a concession in trade talks with the US -- according to a State Council and Communist Party’s Central Office opinion document. The opinion states that progress should be seen by 2022, and by 2025 a better system for protection will be in place. Intellectual property rights and enforcement has been a key US demand in trade talks but is not expected to be part of the phase one trade deal. However, with US/China negotiators reportedly to meet this week, it may lower the bar for a conclusion of the phase one deal, which could see a partial rollback of tariffs and a postponement/cancelling of further tariffs due to come into effect on 15th December. Although the news was being framed by analysts as a concession in trade talks with the US, other reports note China said talks on a 'phase 2' deal would take place only after the US Presidential elections in November 2020, essentially pushing any real negotiating into 2021, some analysts said. However, the China Global Times -- often seen as a mouthpiece for the China state -- reported that contrary to negative media reports, China and the US were very close to the phase one agreement, and China remains committed to continuing talks for a phase two or even a phase three deal with the US, citing experts close to the Chinese government.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FED'S POWELL: </strong>Set to speak at 0000 GMT/1900 ET, Fed Chair Powell is likely stick to the script and repeat recent remarks that the Fed policy stance \"likely to remain appropriate\" as long as incoming data was consistent with the Fed's outlook, and if developments cause a material re-assessment in the Fed's outlook, it will respond accordingly. Powell will likely retain his upbeat on the US economy, seeing a favourable baseline where a sustained expansion of activity, strong labour markets and inflation is near its symmetric 2.0% goal. The Fed chair will likely allude to noteworthy risks given sluggish global growth and trade developments still pose risks, while he may again also warn on persistent below-target inflation weighing on longer-term inflation expectations.</p><p><strong>* TERM REPO: </strong>The NY Fed conducted its first term repo operation extending into the new year on Monday. Primary dealers (PDs) were keen to take up the offer with the USD 25bln offered receiving USD 49bln in bids, a significant oversubscription for the 42-day agreement; meanwhile, the overnight operations remained undersubscribed on Monday. With year-end repo rates priced at just shy of 3.5% (according to ICAP data), PDs were keen to take advantage of the current 1.6% rate for funding through the period. Ahead of Monday’s operations, Deutsche Bank’s analysts noted that it would be a warning sign if the term operation were undersubscribed, as it could indicate the Fed’s operations are ineffective at aiding the distribution of liquidity across the financial system around year-end, citing G-SIB banks perhaps being incentivised to avoid repo trades to avoid rising into higher G-SIB buckets or European banks wanting to avoid higher capital charges from a higher leverage ratio. Ad-hoc analysis suggests these fears are yet to materialise given the oversubscription, but participants now look towards next Monday for the next term repo operation through year-end. Additionally, with the Thanksgiving holiday at the tail-end of this week, month-end flows and Treasury settlement - not to mention the Treasury issuance this week - the overnight and short-term repo markets could face some pressures.</p><p><strong>* US BUDGET: </strong>House and Senate negotiators late Friday reached a deal on top-line spending figures for the FY 2020 budget (a key sticking point that had prevented any final deal being reached), according to sources quoted by The Hill, following days of behind-the-scenes negotiations. Congress last week passed a stopgap spending bill this week, giving lawmakers until 20th December to prevent a shutdown, and in order to achieve that, it will need to pass either an agreement, or another continuing resolution. The Hill speculates that lawmakers have around 15 session dates to iron out details and pass the bill in both the House and the Senate.</p><p><strong>* US ELECTIONS: </strong>Former NY mayor Michael Bloomberg announced on the weekend he will enter the Presidential race, seeking the Democrat nomination. Bloomberg enters the race late, just three months before the first of the state-by-state party nominating contests, and reportedly reflects his scepticism that any of the other Democratic candidates can unseat US President Trump. Bloomberg News said on Sunday it will not investigate its Michael Bloomberg, continuing its policy of limiting coverage of its top executive, though would still do initiative and investigative reporting on US President Trump, though has said it would revisit its policy on Michael Bloomberg if he wins the primaries.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG</strong>: Pro-democracy groups made large gains in district council elections, with 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Voting went ahead peacefully, despite fears it might have been cancelled due to unrest. Some had viewed the election as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, BBC reported, the government and Beijing had been hoping the election would show support from the so-called \"silent majority\", but that did not materialise; on the contrary, pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats. Meanwhile, as US President Trump is yet to announce action on whether he will sign the Hong Kong Bill that was recently passed by Congress -- which would require periodic reviews of HK's special trading status -- China ratchet-up criticism of the US, accusing it of meddling in China's domestic affairs.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> Weekend polling (with the survey period covering the end of last week) showed Conservatives leading Labour by between 10-19% (from around 10-18% versus the previous weekend, though the 19ppts lead reported by Opinium is the largest lead since campaigning began). Much of the Tories gains were at the expense of the Brexit Party, while there have been some positive moves in the support for the LibDems. An analysis in the Sunday Times suggested that if polls stay at current levels, it would imply a majority of around 50 seats for the Conservatives.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Lane stated the ECB will be in the bond market for a long time, adding ECB is signalling quantitative tightening but far in the future. When asked what the ECB would do if the inflation outlook worsens, says the best guide could be what the ECB did in September, namely, a little bit of everything. Lane also spoke yields, noting the recent rise in yields suggests that investors are a little less pessimistic about the economy, noting the yield curve plays a key role for the transmission of monetary policy, under both standard and non-standard policy measures.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLES 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 1929-16+. </strong>The T-note<strong> </strong>edged higher on Monday with a strong US equity market performance putting constraint on the bid for havens. Participants also could be cautious on US debt markets given the large Treasury supply this week, although month-end rebalancing out of equities and into Treasuries is also likely providing support. The shape of the curve was little changed at settlement with yields lower between one and two basis points.</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR REVIEW: </strong>The US sold USD 40bln in 2-year notes at 1.601%, stopping through the WI by 0.4bps and covered at the average ratio in what was a decent auction. Directs took approximately 29%, well above the average, whilst indirects took just under their average and dealers took a haircut on their average.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The Treasury will this week sell a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Monday), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Tuesday), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Wednesday). Analysts at UBS say that the Treasury will give some USD 92bln in cash redemptions and coupon payments this week, implying net cash flows of around 21bln.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Last month's auction saw decent demand from investment funds. The current 5s note appears to be trading fair in asset swap vs older 5s, SocGen says, while it appears to be slightly cheap on the curve against 2s and 10s. SocGen argues that the auction appears to be cheap on an outright basis, given that the current WI is trading above all stop out rates of the last three auctions. Additionally, the bank says that relatively low dealer holdings in the 3 to 6-year bucket should also support demand at the auction. The bank holds a positive bias into the sale.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLES USD 0.24 HIGHER AT USD 58.01/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLES USD 0.26 HIGHER AT USD 63.35/BBL. </strong>Crude markets finished the day slightly higher, after a choppy session during which the complex largely failed to emulate the equity market’s strong performance. The complex derived some impetus after Marathon Petroleum’s (MPC) Los Angeles, California refinery (363k BPD) reported an unplanned breakdown and flaring but was unable to break out of the day’s range. It is also worth noting that a shortened week in the US means that month-end factors could also have been contributing to the choppiness. In separate crude-specific news; Iraq’s Southern oil fields, run by state-owned Basrah Oil, production has been operating at a 25% capacity for the majority of November as Baghdad works towards complying with its OPEC production limit, reported Argus. Finally, in separate supply related news, Libya’s El Sharara oil field is reportedly producing at a clip of close to its 310k BPD capacity.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.8% at 3134, NASDAQ-100 1.2% at 8372, Dow Jones 0.7% at 28067</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.9%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.2%, Energy&nbsp; 0.2%, Financials&nbsp; 0.7%, Health Care&nbsp; 1.1%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.7%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1.4%, Materials&nbsp; 0.6%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.1%, Utilities&nbsp; -0.4%</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Tiffany (TIF) surged after it reached an agreement for LVMH (MC FP) to acquire it for USD 135 in cash, or USD 16.2bln. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) also made strong gains after it confirmed it would be acquired by Charles Schwab (SCHW) for USD 26bln. Medicines Co (MDCO) made gains of over 20% after Novartis (NOVN SW, NOV) agreed to acquire it for USD 9.7bln, or USD 85/share. eBay (EBAY) opened higher, although did pare back, as it announced it would be selling its StubHub for USD 4.05bln to Viagogo. Kirkland Lake Gold (KL) traded lower after it agreed to buy out Detour Gold for just shy of CAD 5bln. Meanwhile, HP Inc (HPQ) has again rejected Xerox (XRX) after its latest acquisition offer.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) pared back some recent losses after CEO Musk tweeted impressive order figures for its Cybertruck. Uber Inc (UBER) took a hit following London removing its license to operate. Nvidia (NVDA) led semiconductors amid an upgrade at Morgan Stanley on anticipation of stronger gaming revenue in 2020. Netflix (NFLX) opened on the backfoot post a downgrade to Underperform at Morgan Stanley, but reversed course through the session as major bourses pushed to new ATHs. CVS Health (CVS) saw a late session bounce on a WSJ report stating Starboard value has taken a stake and the two have held amicable talks.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>traded relatively flat today with DXY trading in a a range of 98.17 at the lows to highs of 98.38. The buck managed to remain relatively stable despite yields falling slightly, appearing it to be propped up on haven outflows following positive US China trade rhetoric, which supported CNH. Early month end re-balancing may also be contributing to price action in the buck given the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of the week. <strong>Havens</strong> were generally weaker, particularly XAU and JPY, although CHF was rather flat. <strong>XAU </strong>traded in an 8-buck range with lows at 1454, where it resides heading into the overnight session<strong>. </strong>USDJPY was firmer on updates on US &amp; China, where the cross found resistance spot on its 200dma at 108.97, a level which it floats within a whisker of heading into Asia-Pac trade. CHF flat against both EUR &amp; USD. <strong>GBP</strong> a strong performer today following weekend polls where one poll had the market friendly conservatives hold a lead above labour as high as 19ppts. Cable initially crossed above the 1.29 handle, however fell back beneath the key level aided by a new ICM poll putting the Tory’s at just a seven-point lead. However, the move was short lived and the cross pared back to trade around the 1.29 handle towards the end of the session. <strong>EUR </strong>traded relatively rangebound against the greenback to start the week with lows at 1.10 and highs of 1.1032, the single currency failed to find impetus from this morning’s German IFO data which was in line with expectations, although Expectations slightly missed, but still picked up from the prior. The <strong>Antipodeans</strong> sold off once the US session went underway mainly as a function of a slightly stronger Dollar and now look set to end the US session modestly softer after its APAC impetus petered out. AUD/USD hovers just above session lows having tested 0.6800 to the upside overnight (vs. low 0.6769) whilst its Kiwi counterpart fell back below its 100 DMA at 0.6425 and looks to end the US session ~0.6400. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker across the board, with Lira falling after reports stated it begun testing the radar on the S-400 missile defence system. BRL also lower, Brazil’s FGV Consumer Confidence data fell from the prior print. MXN still weaker against the greenback, although less so than EM currencies following a strong economic activity data, although GDP Q/Q fell 0.1% short of expectations, although Y/Y was 0.1% stronger than the consensus. ZAR weaker amid comments from the IMF highlighting growth in the nation is to remain sluggish in 2021. The Rand also taking its cues from another poor credit rating, where S&amp;P affirmed its rating, but revised its outlook to negative.</p>",

It is also worth noting that a shortened week in the US means that month-end factors could also have been contributing to the choppiness. In separate crude-specific news; Iraq’s Southern oil fields, run by state-owned Basrah Oil, production has been operating at a 25% capacity for the majority of November as Baghdad works towards complying with its OPEC production limit, reported Argus. Finally, in separate supply related news, Libya’s El Sharara oil field is reportedly producing at a clip of close to its 310k BPD capacity.</li></ul>",

Analysts at UBS say that the Treasury will give some USD 92bln in cash redemptions and coupon payments this week, implying net cash flows of around 21bln. UBS also notes that it will be a big week for the short-end of the curve, with the first Fed repo operation over the turn as well as the Thanksgiving Holiday on Thursday, monthend on Friday, and the bank adds that we should expect a volatile week, with the landscape for the year-end turn to be clear once this week’s events are out of the way. For the 2-year auction, specifically, analysts at BMO say that the strength of the bid will likely continue to come from the domestic investor base, with m ore interest development being the extent of any concession heading into the truncated schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECENT 2-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>• High-yield: (prev. 1.594%, six-auction avg. 1.728%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Tail: (prev. -1.2bps, six-auction avg. -0.9bps)&nbsp;</p><p>• Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.70x, six-auction avg. 2.64x)&nbsp;</p><p>• Dealers: (prev. 31.2%, six-auction avg. 29.3%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Direct: (prev. 14.0%, six-auction avg. 21.1%)&nbsp;</p><p>• Indirect: (prev. 54.8%, six-auction avg. 49.6%)&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Stellar Sterling performance, Lira loses and DXY wobbles",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The broad USD and Index initially staged a comeback as it rebounded off Asia-Pac lows - potentially influenced by early month-end rebalancing amid the holiday-shortened trading week. Overnight trade saw a softer Dollar after the Chinese government vaguely tightened its IP guidance, seemingly a concession. Trade developments remained quiet throughout the EU session, albeit a Global Times article did the rounds on US and China basically reaching broad consensus on Phase One, which employed very similar language to one posted over the weekend. DXY looks to end the EU session on a firmer footing and closer to the top of today’s 98.17-38 range having taken out its 50 DMA at 98.22 earlier in the session. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Powell scheduled to speak at midnight UK-time is unlikely to provide much by way of new substance given the high volume of Fed-speak in recent weeks. Meanwhile, USD/CNH remains heads into the end of the session modestly in the red and towards the middle of its intraday 7.0280-0420 band having tested resistance at its 21 WMA (7.0414) in overnight trade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling remains the top performer amongst G10 peers as it mimics gains seen last week from weekend polls showing a steady uptrend in the Conservative’s lead over the Labour party. Furthermore, analysis on YouGov data could be underpinning the currency as it projects the market-friendly Tory party with a parliamentary majority of 48. Meanwhile, the much-awaited YouGov MRP model is set to be released at 2200GMT on Wednesday, which successfully predicted a hung parliament in the run up to the 2017 general election. Cable topped its 21 DMA at 1.2879 to a high just north of 1.2900 before stabilising around the round figure. Meanwhile, EUR/USD was little impacted by the Ifo Survey which printed a modest improvement in the three metrics but was caveated by cautious comments from the institute, who noted that it is too early to speak of a German economic turnaround. EUR/USD heads into the EU close just north of 1.1000 having traded within a daily band of 1.1005-30 with touted support around 1.0990-94 should the round figure be breached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, JPY</strong></p><p>The Antipodeans have reversed earlier gains but mainly as a function of the stronger Dollar and now look set to end the European day modestly softer after its APAC impetus petered out. AUD/USD hovers just above session lows having tested 0.6800 to the upside overnight (vs. low 0.6772) whilst its Kiwi counterpart fell back below its 100 DMA at 0.6425 and looks to end the EU session ~0.6400. Elsewhere, safe-haven outflow coupled with a firmer USD sees USD/JPY inching closer to the 109.00 mark having topped its 21 DMA at 108.76 and clocking in a 30-pip intraday range heading into the EU close. Risk currencies see little by way of pertinent scheduled events throughout the US and APAC sessions and thus will be on headline watch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Losses for the Lira amid sanction jitters following reports that Turkey has begun testing the radar on the Russian-made S-400 system it acquired earlier this year. Washington has previously moved its red lines on the imposition of CAATSA sanctions to the “activation” of the defence system from the “delivery”, but the testing of the radar equipment could risk provoking US lawmakers. USD/TRY extended on earlier upside and eclipsed 5.7500 to the upside (to a high of 5.7525 vs. a low of 5.7035) having surpassed its 100, 200 and 21 DMAs at 5.7099, 5.7164 and 5.7315 respectively.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The USD and Index kick-start a new week relatively directionless amid consolidation from Friday’s advances. The Dollar succumbed to slight pressure in APAC/early EU hours from trade developments over the weekend after vague reports that China will tighten laws around IP theft, which is seen as a step to appease the US amid stumbling blocks in Phase 1 talks. DXY remains above the 98.00 mark and around recent highs (98.30) and having sound support at its 50 DMA at 98.22. Meanwhile, the CNH feel some reprieve amid the China steps coupled with a firmer-than-forecast PBoC fixing. USD/CNH hovers around 7.0300 having gapped lower at the open last night, currency nearer to the bottom of the 7.0280-0420 daily band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling stands as the marked outperformer thus far and stages similar gains to last Monday as some weekend polls show a steady uptrend in the Conservative’s lead over the Labour party. Furthermore, analysis on YouGov data could be adding further fuel to the bullish fire as it projects the market-friendly Tory party with a parliamentary majority of 48. Cable has reclaimed 1.2850+ status having currently clocked in a range of 1.2842-85 as it eclipses its 21 DMA at 1.2878. Meanwhile, the Single Currency remains relatively uneventful and little swayed by the German Ifo Survey which printed a modest improvement in the three metrics but was caveated by cautious comments from the institute, who noted that it is too early to speak of a German economic turnaround. EUR/USD stay afloat just above 1.1000 with touted support around 1.0990-94 should the round figure be breached with ECB’s Mersch and Lane the EZ highlights post-Ifo, although some calendars also highlight hawk Holzmann on the docket.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, JPY</strong></p><p>All moving according with risk, albeit antipodeans have drifted off highs (amid a firming Buck) following an upbeat APAC performance due their China exposure and in light of the aforementioned China IP announcement, seemingly a concession in trade talks with the US. Further, Hong Kong saw a more peaceful weekend as local elections went underway – which concluded with a landslide win for the pro-democratic candidates and hopes of calm in the region in the aftermath. AUD/USD trades flat intraday having tested 0.6800 to the upside overnight (with AUD 800mln in options expiring between strikes 0.6780-90), although pressure on the Aussie could also stem from the AUD/NZD cross which backed off after failing to breach 1.06 to the upside. The cross also keeps the Kiwi buoyed and still above 0.6400 vs. the USD, having traded within a 20-pip range thus far. Elsewhere, USD/JPY hovers near session highs after printing a high of 108.90 in early trade after surpassing its 21 DMA at 108.76 with added upside in the pair as the Dollar gains traction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira experiences renewed pressure amid reports that Turkey is testing the radars on the Russian made S-400 missile systems, thus potentially prompting backlash from US lawmakers who have threatened CAATSA sanctions should the system be activated. The news of the tests largely overshadows reports of Turkey ceasing military operations in Northern Syria as per its agreement with Russia. USD/TRY topped its 100 and 21 DMAs (5.7100 and 5.7317 respectively) ahead of potential resistance at its 50 DMA (5.7500) with eyes now on any action from US Congress.</p>",

Additionally, China are to increase IP theft penalties, a positive sign given this has been one of the sticking points throughout negotiations; although, reports noted this commitment is vague. Turning to price action Bunds are rangebound within relatively tight parameters around the 171.0 mark. Today’s highlight thus far has been the German Ifo survey which printed broadly in-line, spurring little Bund reaction, with ING noting this adds to the evidence of a bottoming out for the European powerhouse but caveating that it does not equate to a recovery. From a technical perspective, 171.35 and 170.26 may present resistance and support respectively in the event of a break from ranges. Elsewhere, from a UK perspective Gilts are flat this morning and in close proximity to opening levels, with some initially downside in the bond on weekend polling showing the Conservative party maintains a significant lead (as much as 19pp above Labour) and are projected by some to win a comfortable circa 50 seat majority. Looking ahead and to the States where the schedule is sparse at the starts of a holiday week with no data points, but Fed’s Powell is to speak at 00:00GMT/19:00ET for the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. Note, the US curve is currently bear steepening.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led higher by the trade sensitive sectors such as tech and materials although financials lagged amid continued losses in Westpac due to the AUSTRAC breaches which prompted its Chairman Maxsted to put CEO Hartzer on notice that he could be fired if the scandal continues to destabilise the reputation of the bank, while Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) was underpinned by a weaker currency and with commodity-related sectors front running the advances. Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) conformed to the optimism after China’s steps to increase penalties on IP theft, which despite being vague in its promise, is still seen as an effort to appease the US side. In addition, Hong Kong was buoyed following the District Council elections where protests quietened to avert the risk of a cancellation and in which the pan-democratic camp won more than six-folds the number of seats than the pro-Beijing establishment, although gains in the mainland were to a lesser extent following a substantial CNY 180bln net liquidity drain by the PBoC.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>BHP (BHP LN) – </strong>Co. reportedly intend to increase their stake in SolGold according to sources.

In addition, Hong Kong was buoyed following the District Council elections where protests quietened to avert the risk of a cancellation and in which the pan-democratic camp won more than six-fold the number of seats than the pro-Beijing establishment, although gains in the mainland were to a lesser extent following a substantial CNY 180bln net liquidity drain by the PBoC.

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was lifted by the risk appetite and broke through several shorter-term DMAs as it closes in on the 200DMA at 108.94, while antipodeans mildly benefitted from the risk appetite and somewhat improved trade optimism due to their high-beta properties and China exposure.</p><p>SNB Economist Lenz says that it is too early to tell when the deposit rate will move back above, zero, adding that rates could be cut further, albeit, they cannot fall on an indefinite basis.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was lacklustre around the USD 1460/oz level amid a lack of safe-haven demand and as the greenback held on to recent gains, while <strong>copper</strong> conformed to the quiet tone in commodities and only eked minimal gains despite the improved US-China trade headlines.</p><p><strong>Baker Hughes Rig Count (22 Nov): Oil rigs -3 at 671, natgas rigs unchanged at 129, total rigs -3 at 803</strong>.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week on a positive note with sentiment underpinned by encouraging reports from the Greater China region in which Beijing released fresh guidelines to increase penalties on IP theft and after protesters eased tensions in Hong Kong for elections where pro-Democracy candidates are set for a landslide victory. ASX 200 (+0.3%) is led higher by the trade sensitive sectors such as tech and materials although financials lag amid continued losses in Westpac due to the AUSTRAC breaches which prompted its Chairman Maxsted to put CEO Hartzer on notice that he could be fired if the scandal continues to destabilise the reputation of the bank, while Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) is underpinned by a weaker currency and with commodity related sectors front running the advances. Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) conform to the upbeat tone after China’s steps to increase penalties on IP theft which despite being vague in its promise, is still seen as an effort to appease the US side. In addition, Hong Kong is buoyed following the District Council elections where protests quietened to avert the risk of a cancellation and in which the pan-democratic camp were set to win more than six-folds the number of seats than the pro-Beijing establishment, although gains in the mainland were to a lesser extent following a substantial CNY 180bln net liquidity drain by the PBoC.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady and holds near last week’s highs where it had been spurred by stronger than expected US PMI data and weakness across its European counterparts due to their less-encouraging PMI releases. Nonetheless, EUR/USD has found some respite with 1.1015 level providing a floor for the currency and GBP/USD partially nurses losses after the latest Opinium poll showed Conservatives widened their lead to 47% (+3) vs. Labour at 28% (Unch.), with the Datapraxis analysis on YouGov surveys also projecting the Conservatives are set for a majority win of 349 seats. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is lifted by the risk appetite and has broken through several shorter-term DMAs as it homes in on the 200DMA at 108.94, while antipodeans mildly benefit from the risk appetite due to their high-beta properties and the somewhat improved trade optimism.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively uneventful with demand subdued by the heightened risk appetite but with downside pressure also alleviated by the BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 890bln of JGBs with varying maturities.</p>",
