The FOMC rate decision passed as expected (analysis below), although the Fed removed any references in its statement to specific dollar amounts for asset purchases, which was taken as a dovish, although the statement did not provide any explicit forward guidance, which caused some jitters among traders. The Powell presser was as expected, revealing little by way of new information; Powell, however, did not provide too many hints of any upcoming YCC policies, which we had an eye out for. Boeing (BA) missed on EPS and revenue and announced it plans to cut staff, 737 Max production will resume at low rates in 2020; production will increase gradually to 31/month in 2021. 787 production rates to be gradually reduced to 7/month by 2022 (was expected to rise to 10/month in 2021). Alphabet Google (GOOG) missed on EPS although beat on revenue and ad revenues topped expectations; CFO said there were no plans to change its share repurchase programme. AMD (AMD) figures were in line with expectations, although guidance was cut. Ford (F) printed a deeper loss per share than expected while revenue beat. Starbucks (SBUX) missed on EPS but beat on revenue while SSS also missed. It does assume a substernal recover in China by the end of the year and sees 90% of its US stores reopening in early June. General Electric (GE) missed on EPS and revenue and noted a USD 1bln hit on its cash flow while expecting Q2 results to “decline sequentially”. SPX +2.66% at 2940, NDX +3.52% at 8983, DJIA +2.2% at 24,629.</p><p>The T-PLEX had a choppy session, albeit tight ranges, after ultimately reversing earlier gains following the FOMC rate decision, which lacked some details that had been sought after. While equities had made solid gains post the remdesivir announcements, The T-Note’s kneejerk losses were quickly reversed in anticipation of the FOMC, where there had been some expectation of some sort of yield curve control as well as forward guidance. However, upon the release of the statement, no such details were specified, and duration was offered. Although as the Fed Chair Powell press conference got underway, the initial rate backup was pared, perhaps as participants digested the lack of limits to the Fed’s asset purchases, and as Powell stressed the Fed would still be needed to do more – one could cherry-pick several comments for the renewed Treasury strength. By settlement, yields were mixed, although major curve spreads were steeper, with the 10-year yield gravitating around the 62bps area. US T-note futures (M0) settled 1+ ticks lower at 138-31.</p>",

Equities firmed, the curve steepened, the dollar was lower, while gold was flat. The FOMC rate decision passed as expected (analysis below), although the Fed removed any references in its statement to specific dollar amounts for asset purchases, which was taken as a dovish, although the statement did not provide any explicit forward guidance, which caused some jitters among traders. The Powell presser was as expected, revealing little by way of new information; Powell, however, did not provide too many hints of any upcoming YCC policies, which we had an eye out for. On the corporate front, earnings over the last couple of days have not done anything to dent risk appetite; after market, titans MSFT and FB are on the slate, ahead of AAPL and AMZN, alongside the ECB, on Thursday.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Wednesday (via state official health departments) against Tuesday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US</strong>: cases rise to 1,005,147 (prev. 981,246), death toll rises to 57,505 (prev. 55,258)</li><li><strong>NEW YORK</strong>: Cases +1.6% at 299,691 (Prev. +1.1% at 295,106); death toll +1.9% at 17968 (prev. +1.9% at 17,638)</li><li><strong>ITALY: </strong>cases rise to 203,591 (prev. +1.1% at 201,505), death toll rises to 27,682 (prev. +1.4% at 27,359)</li><li><strong>UK: </strong>death toll rises to 26,097; deaths rise by 765 (578 hospital vs. yesterday’s 586).</li></ul><p><strong>GILEAD</strong> announced results from its own SIMPLE study of Remdisivir used in severe COVID-19 patients, which showed similar effects for 5-day treatment against 10-day; additionally it announced that it is aware that the drug had met its primary endpoint from the government (NIAID) study (results due Wednesday at 1700 ET). The announcements, akin to prior Remsidivir updates, saw equity bourses rally, although discussion revolves around whether the optimism is premature. Firstly, the severe patients study success will only be constructive if the drug passes on a safety and efficacy basis – something which the government (NIAID) study should provide some insight on, although as of yet, it is not quite clear if the study is testing for both bases. If the government study proves that the drug fails on safety/efficacy, then the difference between 5-day and 10-day treatment will be meaningless, but on the contrary, if the drug passes, then today’s results would mean greater supply available as patients would require less of the treatment, hence optimising its availability. Sceptics also draw attention to the fact that the Gilead trial results announced today had a 9% fatality rate, or 39 deaths, which appears only a moderate improvement to the natural death rate from the virus, although the sample size is small and thus drawing conclusions in general from the results are difficult. Instead, the wider government study to be released tonight should provide a greater understanding, and optimist on the drug allude to the fact that White House officials, including President Trump, have pre-announced that the results will be released and drawn attention to the study – see Fauci comments below – which could be indicative of success in the trial.</p><p><strong>NIH DIRECTOR FAUCI</strong> said preliminary Remdesivir results indicate patients who received the drug had a 31% faster recovery time than those with a placebo (note that the statistical significance of such claims remain cloudy). Fauci said it showed Remdesivir accelerated recovery from advanced COVID-19 cases. The preliminary results suggested a survival benefit with a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving Remdesivir vs 11.6% for those with a placebo. Median recovery times was 11 days for those with Remdesivir, compared to 15 days for those who received a placebo, Fauci said.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FOMC: </strong>The Fed’s rate decision came in broadly as expected; the federal funds rate target and the interest on excess reserves were left unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and 0.10% respectively. The Fed reiterated its commitment to keep rates at current low levels until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its inflation and labour market goals. One key omission was the removal of references to specific amounts of asset purchases (previously it indicated that it would buy “at least” USD 500bln of Treasuries and at least USD 200bln of MBS); instead, it said it would purchase in amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which an be taken as a pledge for limitless QE. Some traders were disappointed by the lack of explicit forward guidance within the statement. At the press conference, Chair Powell reiterated that rates are to remain at low levels until the economy has weathered the COVID impact. On the economy, Powell said that economic activity would drop at an “unprecedented rate” in Q2, and the jobless rate will likely next week rise into double digits; he added that we will see economic data in Q2 that is worse than anything we have seen, and while he thinks Q3 might see substantial growth, there was still the risk that the virus resurges. Powell played down that the Fed’s policy action could prevent the downside in activity, stating that the downturn will hinge on the broad policy response – preserving the supply of credit to the real economy was essential to set the stage for the recovery. On asset purchases, Powell said that the Fed’s bond buys will foster more accommodative financial conditions, and that the central bank would continue to use tools as long as needed to ensure when the economy begins recovering, that recovery will be robust as possible; on the removal of the dollar amount of asset purchases within that statement, he said the policy stance on asset purchases remains appropriate for now, and the Fed was waiting for see how economic conditions evolve before changing that view, given the difference paths that the economy might take. When asked about deflation threats, Powell said that as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, the US should not see deflation. For companies specifically, Powell said a corporate credit facility was near being finalised, and that it would be shaped and expanded after it begins. Looking ahead, Powell suggested that the Fed and the government may need to do more to ensure that the recovery is robust. In terms of the outlook, Powell identified medium-term risks: the virus and bringing it under control; the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy; the global dimension, where negative data abroad can weigh on the US; Powell believes that the Fed has the policies to address these, but not perfectly. The Fed chair said activity would begin to increase as re-openings begins, but will take time to get to more normal levels of unemployment, but the Fed was in no hurry to withdraw support for the economy. Notably, the press conference gave no hints about future YCC policies.</p><p><strong>ECB PREVIEW: </strong>The ECB is expected to stand pat on rates this week with focus instead likely to fall on the Bank’s balance sheet and how it views monetary and fiscal actions taken thus far. On the balance sheet, consensus leans in favour of the GC needing to expand the current scope of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). Views are mixed on whether such an adjustment will be made this week or Lagarde will invoke strong rhetoric on the Bank’s preparedness to do more and defer the decision until June when lockdown measures have been eased across the Eurozone. As has been a common theme throughout Lagarde’s tenure, the President will likely use the press conference as a forum to call for further support from fiscal authorities. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24387/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US STIMULUS:</strong> Treasury Secretary Mnuchin noted there had been no discussions yet regarding another replenishment of PPP loans, adding USD 259bln in unallocated COVID-19 capital will be used to supplement or create new Federal Reserve lending programmes, which Mnuchin stated should be broad-based and not industry-focused. After the airlines received an extra USD 9.5bln in payroll support, he noted there are currently no plans for additional money for airlines at this time. Elsewhere, an article from Argus noted US President Trump’s administration is close to rolling out new lending facilities to help oil and gas companies struggling from a collapse in prices brought on by Covid-19. The journalist, citing comments from Energy Secretary Brouillette noted the program, which is still under development, would primarily consist of the Treasury offering “bridge loans to help the industry through this pandemic” and the Federal Reserve offering emergency lending under the so-called “section 13(3)” programme.&nbsp; Brouillette also added the lending facilities were not meant for “big players” in the sector that have other sources of capital.</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLES 2.72 HIGHER AT USD 15.06/BBL; WTI (N0) SETTLES 1.52 HIGHER AT 19.12/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES USD 2.08 HIGHER AT 22.54/BBL, BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 1.49 HIGHER AT 24.23/BBL.</strong></p><p>Solid gains for crude oil futures on Wednesday, although fears around global storage difficulties still remain; however, the current daily choppiness in oil prices makes it difficult to read too much into intraday moves. Further chunky builds in US inventories were reported, as expected; crude stocks +9mln, with Cushing +3.6mln (stocks at the highest levels since November 2017), gasoline -3.7mln, distillates +5.1mln. The EIA also reported production falling 100k BPD to 12.1mln BPD, while refinery utlilisation rose by 2%. The energy desk at Citi noted that some of today’s strength could be a function of the declining rate of increases of US inventories, as well as potentially some late short-covering in June Brent which expires on Thursday; Citi also highlights the potential for relief in June WTI after pressure eases from exiting ETF positions (USO). Evidence of the supply glut and storage woes continues to filter through, where sources reported that US buyers of Saudi crude have cancelled at least seven April-loading VLCCs amid rising freight costs. Nigeria deferred seven May-loading crude oil cargoes of Erha, Usan, Yoho and Zafiro grades to June.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 1+ TICKS LOWER AT 138-31.</strong></p><p>The T-PLEX had a choppy session, albeit tight ranges, after ultimately reversing earlier gains following the FOMC rate decision, which lacked some details that had been sought after. While equities had made solid gains post the remdesivir announcements, The T-Note’s kneejerk losses were quickly reversed in anticipation of the FOMC, where there had been some expectation of some sort of yield curve control as well as forward guidance. However, upon the release of the statement, no such details were specified, and duration was offered. Although as the Fed Chair Powell press conference got underway, the initial rate backup was pared, perhaps as participants digested the lack of limits to the Fed’s asset purchases, and as Powell stressed the Fed would still be needed to do more – one could cherry-pick several comments for the renewed Treasury strength. By settlement, yields were mixed, although major curve spreads were steeper, with the 10-year yield gravitating around the 62bps area.</p><p><strong>MONTH-END:</strong> UBS notes large Treasury extension (0.14yrs) for the end-April rebalancing. UBS says this is higher than its 3-year end-April average (0.07yrs) and historical 3-month, 6-month, 12-month averages. “It is worth noting that this unusual large extension is a result of temporary change in the rebalancing rule last month and hence incomparable to historical extension.” The bank also estimates that month-end pension rebalancing could see USD 75-115bln equities sold, and reinvested into bonds, UBS says. Model predicts USD 90-140bln of US equity selling, versus USD 15-25bln of international equity buying.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +2.66% at 2940, NDX +3.52% at 8983, DJIA +2.2% at 24,629.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy +7.4%, IT +4.2%, Financials +3%, Materials +2.6%, Consumer Discretionary +2.3%, Industrials +1.9%, Communications Svs. +1.8%, Health Care +0.7%, Real Estate +0.4%, Consumer Staples -0.4%, Utilities -0.9%</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Boeing (BA) missed on EPS and revenue and announced it plans to cut staff, 737 Max production will resume at low rates in 2020; production will increase gradually to 31/month in 2021. 787 production rates to be gradually reduced to 7/month by 2022 (was expected to rise to 10/month in 2021). Alphabet Google (GOOG) missed on EPS although beat on revenue and ad revenues topped expectations; CFO said there were no plans to change its share repurchase programme. AMD (AMD) figures were in line with expectations, although guidance was cut. Ford (F) printed a deeper loss per share than expected while revenue beat. Starbucks (SBUX) missed on EPS but beat on revenue while SSS also missed. It does assume a substernal recover in China by the end of the year and sees 90% of its US stores reopening in early June. General Electric (GE) missed on EPS and revenue and noted a USD 1bln hit on its cash flow while expecting Q2 results to “decline sequentially”.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Gilead (GILD) provided a Remdesivir update where it noted it is aware of positive data emerging from the NIAID study and understand the trial met its primary endpoint. Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) Phase 1/2 a trial evaluating its MERS-CoV DNA vaccine candidate, INO-4700 saw strong antibody and T cell immune responses while being well tolerated with no vaccine related severe adverse events were seen. The SEC is investigating Luckin Coffee (LK) regarding the disclosure that some of its employees fabricated sales last year, according to WSJ citing sources.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>US GDP (Q1):</strong> US growth declined by 4.8% annualised in Q1, deeper than the -4.0% the street was modelling. With that said, the range of forecasts was so dispersed that minor deviation versus the consensus view can be ignored. Accordingly, the expansion that began in Q3 2009 ended in Q1 2020 after the COVID-19 fallout.</p><p><strong>CONSUMPTION:</strong> In terms of the details, consumption was horrific, falling by 7.6% in the quarter; Pantheon Macroeconomics infers, that assuming there are no revisions to January and February data, it implies consumption fell by 6.8% M/M in March (the March data will be released on Thursday, and the consensus expects -5.7%).</p><p><strong>BUSINESS INVESTMENT</strong> was also grim, falling by 8.6%; Pantheon now expects Q2 business investment levels to plunge by 30%, though a healthy rise in housing investment will offset that.</p><p><strong>Q2 GROWTH:</strong> There is a justified assumption that Q1 will lay the foundation for a technical recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth); ING believes that Q2 output might contract by a whopping 40% annualised (-10% Q/Q), and if realised, the bank says it would mean that US economic output will be down 13% peak to trough. “This is on a par with the downturn experienced as World War II concluded, but that occurred over three years, not two quarters as is happening today.” Fed Chair Powel in his press conference used similar rhetoric, suggesting the decline will be “unprecedented”.</p><p><strong>SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY:</strong> ING does not think a V-shape recovery will be seen, arguing that the legacy of the crisis and the potential for long term structural changes mean at best it currently thinks the lost output in 1Q and 2Q won’t be fully regained until late 2022. “This is all quite gloomy, but with the Federal Reserve and the government continuing to offer support and with Covid-19 containment measures likely to ease further in the second half of the year – particularly if work on a vaccine makes substantial progress - the news flow for the economy should be much improved for 3Q and 4Q.” The bank argues, that in order to regain the lost output by late 2022, additional fiscal stimulus will be required and looks very likely, and this may be a key theme in the US Presidential election campaigns.</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD SELL OFF AMID POSITIVE RISK SENTIMENT EXACERBATED POST FED</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The dollar continued to lose ground as sentiment improves, taking its cues from risk. There was also likely a factor of caution ahead of the FOMC meeting which resulted in selling pressure for the buck as the reference to specific dollar amounts of asset purchases was removed, suggesting the Fed is open to more largesse, a point that was echoed in the press conference.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency traded slightly firmer today, shrugging-off data which saw Industrial and service sentiment falling further, while consumer confidence remained at -22.7. German CPI however picked up to 0.3% M/M, although the pace slowed to 0.8% Y/Y from 1.4%, which was above the expectations of a 0.6% print. Overnight, Italy was downgraded at Fitch, though still remains at Investment Grade, although even with risk of a further downgrade the ECB will still accept Italy debt as collateral given its recent changes to accept debt which was eligible on April 7th. With the EZ one of the hardest hit areas from COVID-19, promising updates on Remdesivir are likely supporting the currency.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen also benefitted from a weaker dollar today, and USDJPY saw a technical break beneath 106.90/00 support. JPMorgan said that its observed flows remain muted and “would struggle to say the market is anywhere near overly long JPY at this juncture” and is looking for a re-test of the 105.00/25 in the coming sessions.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP, CAD):</strong> In line with risk sentiment the cyclicals performed well once again although GBP was rather lacklustre in comparison. ING highlights that GBP has failed to fully cash-in on the dollar weakness as Brexit headlines resurface, and the end-June deadline to request an extension to the transition period approaches. The UK government is so far sticking to its guns and seems determined not to request an extension. NZD outperformed along with the Aussie following decent trade data, which saw a surplus in March of 672mln while exports rose to 5.81bln. The Aussie is also performing well after firmer CPI which printed 2.2%, picking up from the prior 1.8% and above expectations for a 2.0% print. CAD saw solid gains aided by the risk sentiment, weaker dollar and decent gains in crude. The trifecta of catalysts saw USDCAD fall beneath 1.40 to lows just above 1.39.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (RUB, MXN):</strong> With a nice bounce in the crude complex today both RUB and MXN saw a direct benefit while a weaker dollar only supported the currencies. The TRY was slightly firmer against the falling buck, although given it is a net importer of oil it was a relative underperformer across EM’s.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> The improved risk sentiment/weaker dollar aided by a positive Remdesivir trial update saw EMs firm across the board, with outperformance seen in the ZAR&nbsp; and BRL despite ongoing issues in both countries, with both largely taking cues from the risk appetite after recent currency depreciation which saw the BRL hit record lows against the buck.</p><p><strong>FX WINNERS &amp; LOSERS:</strong> Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir experimental COVID-19 vaccine had preliminary trial data released today, which saw a positive response from many officials, including Dr. Fauci. Initially the time frame for a vaccine to treat COVID-19 was between 12-18 months, with some noting the faster a vaccine can be reached, the more supportive it would be towards a recovery. HSBC lay out their EM FX winners and losers in each type of scenario, where the ! represents a second round of downward growth.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD:</strong> The dollar continued to lose ground as sentiment improves, taking its cues from risk. There was also likely a factor of caution ahead of the FOMC meeting which resulted in selling pressure for the buck as the reference to specific dollar amounts of asset purchases was removed, suggesting the Fed is open to more largesse, a point that was echoed in the press conference.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency traded slightly firmer today, shrugging-off data which saw Industrial and service sentiment falling further, while consumer confidence remained at -22.7. German CPI however picked up to 0.3% M/M, although the pace slowed to 0.8% Y/Y from 1.4%, which was above the expectations of a 0.6% print. Overnight, Italy was downgraded at Fitch, though still remains at Investment Grade, although even with risk of a further downgrade the ECB will still accept Italy debt as collateral given its recent changes to accept debt which was eligible on April 7th. With the EZ one of the hardest hit areas from COVID-19, promising updates on Remdesivir are likely supporting the currency.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The Yen also benefitted from a weaker dollar today, and USDJPY saw a technical break beneath 106.90/00 support. JPMorgan said that its observed flows remain muted and “would struggle to say the market is anywhere near overly long JPY at this juncture” and is looking for a re-test of the 105.00/25 in the coming sessions.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP, CAD): </strong>In line with risk sentiment the cyclicals performed well once again although GBP was rather lacklustre in comparison. ING highlights that GBP has failed to fully cash-in on the dollar weakness as Brexit headlines resurface, and the end-June deadline to request an extension to the transition period approaches. The UK government is so far sticking to its guns and seems determined not to request an extension. NZD outperformed along with the Aussie following decent trade data, which saw a surplus in March of 672mln while exports rose to 5.81bln. The Aussie is also performing well after firmer CPI which printed 2.2%, picking up from the prior 1.8% and above expectations for a 2.0% print. CAD saw solid gains aided by the risk sentiment, weaker dollar and decent gains in crude. The trifecta of catalysts saw USDCAD fall beneath 1.40 to lows just above 1.39.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (RUB, MXN):</strong> With a nice bounce in the crude complex today both RUB and MXN saw a direct benefit while a weaker dollar only supported the currencies. The TRY was slightly firmer against the falling buck, although given it is a net importer of oil it was a relative underperformer across EM’s.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> The improved risk sentiment/weaker dollar aided by a positive Remdesivir trial update saw EMs firm across the board, with outperformance seen in the ZAR&nbsp; and BRL despite ongoing issues in both countries, with both largely taking cues from the risk appetite after recent currency depreciation which saw the BRL hit record lows against the buck.</p><p><strong>FX WINNERS &amp; LOSERS: </strong>Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir experimental COVID-19 vaccine had preliminary trial data released today, which saw a positive response from many officials, including Dr. Fauci. Initially the time frame for a vaccine to treat COVID-19 was between 12-18 months, with some noting the faster a vaccine can be reached, the more supportive it would be towards a recovery. HSBC lay out their EM FX winners and losers in each type of scenario, where the ! represents a second round of downward growth.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/c0644cac-a6a4-4407-9fc0-c4d59492919f.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>At the press conference, Chair Powell reiterated that rates are to remain at low levels until the economy has weathered the COVID impact. On the economy, Powell said that economic activity would drop at an “unprecedented rate” in Q2, and the jobless rate will likely next week rise into double digits; he added that we will see economic data in Q2 that is worse than anything we have seen, and while he thinks Q3 might see substantial growth, there was still the risk that the virus resurges. Powell played down that the Fed’s policy action could prevent the downside in activity, stating that the downturn will hinge on the broad policy response – preserving the supply of credit to the real economy was essential to set the stage for the recovery. On asset purchases, Powell said that the Fed’s bond buys will foster more accommodative financial conditions, and that the central bank would continue to use tools as long as needed to ensure when the economy begins recovering, that recovery will be robust as possible; on the removal of the dollar amount of asset purchases within that statement, he said the policy stance on asset purchases remains appropriate for now, and the Fed was waiting for see how economic conditions evolve before changing that view, given the difference paths that the economy might take. When asked about deflation threats, Powell said that as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, the US should not see deflation. For companies specifically, Powell said a corporate credit facility was near being finalised, and that it would be shaped and expanded after it begins. Looking ahead, Powell suggested that the Fed and the government may need to do more to ensure that the recovery is robust. In terms of the outlook, Powell identified medium-term risks: the virus and bringing it under control; the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy; the global dimension, where negative data abroad can weigh on the US; Powell believes that the Fed has the policies to address these, but not perfectly. The Fed chair said activity would begin to increase as re-openings begins, but will take time to get to more normal levels of unemployment, but the Fed was in no hurry to withdraw support for the economy.</p>",

Further chunky builds in US inventories were reported, as expected; crude stocks +9mln, with Cushing +3.6mln (stocks at the highest levels since November 2017), gasoline -3.7mln, distillates +5.1mln. The EIA also reported production falling 100k BPD to 12.1mln BPD, while refinery utlilisation rose by 2%. The energy desk at Citi noted that some of today’s strength could be a function of the declining rate of increases of US inventories, as well as potentially some late short-covering in June Brent which expires on Thursday; Citi also highlights the potential for relief in June WTI after pressure eases from exiting ETF positions (USO). Evidence of the supply glut and storage woes continues to filter through, where sources reported that US buyers of Saudi crude have cancelled at least seven April-loading VLCCs amid rising freight costs. Nigeria deferred seven May-loading crude oil cargoes of Erha, Usan, Yoho and Zafiro grades to June.</li></ul>",

The Fed reiterated its commitment to keep rates at current low levels until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its inflation and labour market goals. One key omission was the removal of references to specific amounts of asset purchases (previously it indicated that it would buy \"at least\" USD 500bln of Treasuries and at least USD 200bln of MBS); instead, it said it would purchase in amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which an be taken as a pledge for limitless QE until the economy is back in line with its mandate. Some traders were disappointed by the lack of explicit forward guidance within the statement, which chair Powell will no doubt be asked about in his press conference at 1430 ET. Also in that press conference, the desk will be watching out for any references to yield curve control, which the Fed may use in combination with its pledge to keep rates at low levels, keeping shorter-dated Treasury yields anchored, although most analysts expect updates on this at the June FOMC.&nbsp;</p>",

However, the <strong>DXY </strong>remains rangebound between 99.500-100.000 parameters as the clock ticks down to the Fed and Chair Powell’s presser even though broader risk sentiment has been boosted by an encouraging, if not conclusive update from Gilead on the anti-coronavirus remdesivir drug along with the ongoing recovery in crude.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie are both off best levels carved out vs their US counterpart after supportive overnight data in the form of a record rise in exports and CPI surpassing forecasts. Nzd/Usd is back around 0.6100 ahead of NBNZ business indicators and Aud/Usd is just below 0.6550 in advance of AIG’s manufacturing PMI, while the Loonie may derive more momentum from the aforementioned rebound in oil prices following weekly EIA inventories showing a smaller than anticipated build in US crude stocks, as Usd/Cad hovers in the low 1.3900 area.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>Aside from some volatility around the early US data that was completely misreported by one major newswire that seemingly got its +/- signs mixed up, the Euro. Yen and Franc have not deviated far from 1.0850, 106.50 and 0.9730-40 respectively. Nevertheless, Usd/Jpy did breach a key chart level at one point (106.45) and Eur/Usd got close to triggering an expiry at 1.0865 having bounced ahead of similar sized option interest between 1.0815-20 and absorbing bad news, like Italy’s downgrade by Fitch and deteriorating Eurozone sentiment. In contrast, Sterling failed to fully weather a push-back by the UK on the prospect of COVID-19 restrictions being lifted ‘early’ or intermittent RHS demand in Eur/Gbp, especially around fix times that lifted the cross back through the 200 DMA (0.8733) temporarily and Cable under 1.2400 to test the 200 HMA (1.2397).</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The firmer bounce in crude noted above has helped the Norwegian Crown resume its rally, while also giving the Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso more fuel, but strength in the SA Rand and Brazil’s Real is less easy to fathom given well documented negative factors like political turmoil in the case of the latter heightened by the Supreme Court suspending the proposed appointment of a new Federal Police Chief.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MARKET SNAPSHOT:</strong> Asia had an upside bias, European equity bourses are mixed, but US futures are higher after encouraging updates from some corporate earnings with a boost from a positive remdesivir update, although we are off the highs. There is a mixed tone in Europe, with healthcare names weighing, although auto names are firmer after higher than expected profit view from Daimler (DAI GY), while VW (VOW GY) also sees a profit in the FY. DBK GY and BARC numbers were decent, particularly the latter’s trading revenue, while sensor maker AMS said consumer solutions and programs for smartphone makers remained drivers of high demand despite the pandemic. The dollar is lower ahead of FOMC meeting this afternoon and after US GDP declined 4.8%. Oil is paring back some recent losses after API data on Tuesday showed a smaller than expected build, and a 2.5mln build at Cushing (if this is seen in the official DOE data, it would be the smallest weekly Cushing build since March), as well as some constructive comments from Russia on production (might be -15% this year). Treasury yields are higher, although major curve spreads are mixed, but not too far from neutral.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Most US equity sectors have opened in positive territory, with gains in Energy and Communication Services with the latter benefitting after earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL). Defensives are underperforming, with Consumer Staples the only sector in negative territory, while Health Care and Utilities are only marginally firmer. Staples likely weighed on after positive Remdesivir headlines, since many staples benefitted from stockpiling amid COVID-19, while Mondelez (MDLZ) earnings also likely weighing.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Boeing (BA) missed on EPS and revenue and announced it plans to cut staff, 737 Max production will resume at low rates in 2020; production will increase gradually to 31/month in 2021. 787 production rates to be gradually reduced to 7/month by 2022 (was expected to rise to 10/month in 2021). Alphabet Google (GOOG) missed on EPS although beat on revenue, and ad revenues topped expectations; CFO said there were no plans to change its share repurchase programme. AMD (AMD) figures were in line with expectations, although guidance was cut. Ford (F) printed a deeper loss per share than expected while revenue beat. Starbucks (SBUX) missed on EPS but beat on revenue while SSS also missed. It does expect a substernal recover in China by the end of the year and sees 90% of its US stores reopening in early June.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Gilead (GILD) provided a Remdesivir update where it noted it is aware of positive data emerging from the NIAID study and understand the trial met its primary end point. Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) Phase 1/2 a trial evaluating its MERS-CoV DNA vaccine candidate, INO-4700 saw strong antibody and T cell immune responses while being well tolerated with no vaccine related severe adverse events were seen. Luckin Coffee (LK) is being investigated by the SEC in regard to the disclosure that some of its employees fabricated sales last year, according to WSJ citing sources familiar with the matter.</p><p><strong>FED AHEAD:</strong> No major announcements are expected; rates are seen unchanged at the ELB of 0-0.25%. There will be focus on the updated statement that reflects incoming information, as well as the Committee’s judgement on how its new facilities are evolving. The FOMC will likely reiterate pledges to do more if necessary. Traders will also be looking for clues about forward guidance changes, and other new policies in the pipeline, like yield curve control.

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Q1 GROWTH: </strong>US growth declined by 4.8% annualised in Q1, deeper than the -4.0% the Street was modelling. With that said, the range of forecasts was so wide, that minor deviation versus the consensus view can be ignored. Accordingly, the expansion that began in Q3 2009 ended in Q1 2020 after the COVID-19 fallout.</li><li><strong>CONSUMPTION: </strong>In terms of the details, consumption was horrific, falling by 7.6% in the quarter; Pantheon Macroeconomics infers that, assuming there are no revisions to January and February data, it implies consumption fell by 6.8% M/M in March (the March data will be released on Thursday, and the consensus expects -5.7%).</li><li><strong>BUSINESS INVESTMENT: </strong>Business investment was also grim, falling by 8.6%; Pantheon now expects Q2 business investment levels to plunge by 30%, though that will be offset by a healthy rise in housing investment.</li><li><strong>Q2 GROWTH:</strong> There is a justified assumption that Q1 will lay the foundation for a technical recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth); ING believes that Q2 output might contract by a whopping 40% annualised (-10% Q/Q), and if realised, the bank says it would mean that US economic output will be down 13% peak to trough. “This is on a par with the downturn experienced as World War II concluded, but that occurred over three years, not two quarters as is happening today.”</li><li><strong>SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY: </strong>ING does not think a V-shape recovery will be seen, arguing that the legacy of the crisis and the potential for long term structural changes mean at best we currently think the lost output in 1Q and 2Q won’t be fully regained until late 2022. “This is all quite gloomy, but with the Federal Reserve and the government continuing to offer support and with Covid-19 containment measures likely to ease further in the second half of the year – particularly if work on a vaccine makes substantial progress - the news flow for the economy should be much improved for 3Q and 4Q.” The bank argues that, in order to regain the lost output by late 2022, additional fiscal stimulus will be required and looks very likely, and this may be a key theme in the US Presidential election campaigns.</li></ul>",

Hence, a flurry of movement in bond and currency markets awaiting confirmation of the true Q1 GDP outcome and a correction from vendor that got the figure completely wrong. However, debt futures have now settled down off best levels, but still firm, while the Dollar remains under pressure, albeit off lows after Usd/Jpy knee-jerked higher towards 106.90 peaks and then faded. Conversely, equities rallied on Gilead and are building momentum into the Wall Street open, perhaps on the basis that the 4.8% contraction could have been even worse given estimates as weak as -15%, though Q2 will be a quite different story of course.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>MARKET SNAPSHOT:</strong> Asia had an upside bias, European equity bourses are mixed, but US futures are higher after encouraging updates from some corporate earnings. There is a mixed tone in Europe, with healthcare names weighing, although auto names are firmer after higher than expected profit view from Daimler (DAI GY), while VW (VOW GY) also sees a profit in the FY. DBK GY and BARC numbers were decent, particularly the latter’s trading revenue, while sensor maker AMS said consumer solutions and programs for smartphone makers remained drivers of high demand despite the pandemic. The dollar is lower ahead of the US GDP data and FOMC meeting this afternoon. Oil is paring back some recent losses after API data on Tuesday showed a smaller than expected build, and a 2.5mln build at Cushing (if this is seen in the official DOE data, it would be the smallest weekly Cushing build since March), as well as some constructive comments from Russia on production (might be -15% this year). Treasury yields are higher, although major curve spreads are mixed, but not too far from neutral.</li><li><strong>US EARNINGS: </strong>Earnings season is in full swing, and Wednesday/Thursday will be the ‘peak’ days for US earnings. Last night, GOOG missed on EPS, beat on revenue, and reported better than expected ad sales; YUM is making progress on SSS in China, while SBUX also sees china sales back to pre-crisis levels by Q3, and 90% of US stores open by June. AMD cut its outlook, however. And today, MA reported better than Street expectations, and is seeing signs of stability in spending trends, though suspended its share buybacks. Later today, we get reports from some big hitters after market, including <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/key-metrics-facebook-fb-to-report-q1-2020-at-1605-et-2105-bst-29-04-2020\">FB</a>, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/key-metrics-microsoft-msft-to-report-q3-2020-at-1620-et-2120-bst-29-04-2020\">MSFT</a> and <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/key-metrics-tesla-tsla-to-report-q1-2020-at-1615-et-2115-bst-29-04-2020\">TSLA</a>.</li><li><strong>US Q1 GDP AHEAD: </strong>The Street is modelling GDP will contract by 4.0% in Q1’s advanced report, although the range of forecasts notes the uncertainty around the print, with the low forecast looking for -15.0%, and the high forecast looking for +1.0%. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-q1-advanced-gdp-data-released-at-0830-et-1330-bst-street-looks-for-4-0-and-q2-will-likely-be-worse-29-04-2020\">Full primer here</a>.</li><li><strong>FED AHEAD: </strong>No major announcements are expected; rates are seen unchanged at the ELB of 0-0.25%. There will be focus on the updated statement that reflects incoming information, as well as the Committee’s judgement on how its new facilities are evolving. The FOMC will likely reiterate pledges to do more if necessary. Traders will also be looking for clues about forward guidance changes, and other new policies in the pipeline, like yield curve control. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/re-post-preview-fomc-rate-decision-due-at-1400-et-1900-bst-powell-press-conference-at-1430-et-1930-bst-29-04-2020\">Full preview here</a>.</li><li><strong>BAD BREADTH:</strong> Jefferies analysts note that the recovery in global share prices from the March lows has not been accompanied by an expansion in market breadth. \"Unlike turning points for markets and earnings at the bottom, there is no clear evidence on how the technical picture should evolve,\" the bank writes, and \"the current rally suggests that conviction levels are low in our view.\" Jefferies notes that in December, when market breadth was similarly poor, equity share prices were closing in on new highs. \"Indeed, the five largest US stocks account for just under 18% of the US total market cap but this is still below the peak of 22% seen in early March,\" it writes, \"and other indicators are also pointing to a poor technical picture. \"For instance, market breadth is still lacklustre across both DM and EM indices while the number of stocks above their 260-day moving average is still very low, and equally, the number of stocks making new highs versus new lows is about equal.\"</li></ul>",

(Full expectations can be found on our live economic calendar, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/calendar_events/list?time_zone=&amp;search%5Btext_query%5D=&amp;search%5Bby_day%5D=2020-04-29\">here</a>)</li><li><strong>CONSUMPTION: </strong>Desks note that there has been limited monthly data on services spending released so far, however, and Citi says the uncertainty around consumption estimates is greater than usual and two-sided. RBC, meanwhile, is looking for a better-than consensus -1.5%, says the downside will be driven by weak personal consumption in the tail-end of March. “We see real spending on the quarter slipping -3.5% annualised and subtracting about -2.5ppts from the headline, but there should be some offsets from residential investment (housing looked quite good up until very recently) and trade.”</li><li><strong>BUSINESS INVESTMENT: </strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics is looking for clear declines in business investment, which was softening even before the COVID-19 fallout. \"The trade war is likely to blame for the weakness in capex through mid-March, but the numbers since then are dominated by the impact of the virus.\"</li><li><strong>AHEAD: </strong>In terms of the market focus, the Q2 GDP data will be of far more interest (some expectations of a -30% annualised reading), and desks have suggested that it will be easy to look through the Q1 data. \"With such a grim end to the first quarter and a similarly terrible start to the second, it will be very hard to avoid a huge annualised decline across Q2 as a whole,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"even if spending rebounds by 2% month-to-month in both May and June as lockdowns are eased, the quarterly drop would be about 22%. And that's our best case scenario; our central forecast is -35%.\"</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Overall uninspiring trade in the equity sphere thus far (Euro Stoxx 50 Unch)</strong> as the region mimics a similar performance seen in Asia-Pac ahead of key US Q1 GDP, FOMC, and as participants digest a slew of earnings. SMI (-0.4%) sees modest underperformance on the back of large-cap stocks in the red, including Pharma-giants Roche (-1.0%) and Novartis (-0.8%) – which collectively account for just under 40% of the index, and thus pressure is also seen in the pharma sector. Other sectors are mostly mixed and do not reflect a clean risk sentiment. Energy tops the charts amid gains in the oil complex. The sector breakdown also paints the same mixed picture, with Oil &amp; Gas at the top whilst Healthcare lags; Travel &amp; Leisure sees itself in modest positive territory. As mentioned above, the morning saw a flurry of earnings; Airbus (+0.8%) rises despite dismal COVID-impacted numbers including a net loss of EUR 481mln, with potential upside attributed to French Finance Minister alluding to a safety net for the company if needed. Deutsche Bank (+2.2%) sees support from in-line numbers alongside FIC trading topping forecasts. Barclays (+6%) was bolstered at the open as its Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) revenue came in at almost GBP 1bln above forecasts. Other earnings-related movers include: Volkswagen (+2.5%), Daimler (+2.2%), AstraZeneca (+0.8%), AMS (+18.8%) and Nordea Bank (+4.5%). Elsewhere, Wirecard (-4.3%) shares fell 10% at one point after activist Hohn called on the Co. to remove its CEO following the KPMG audit.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD -</strong> Notwithstanding the underlying or overall sell US Dollar dynamic for portfolio rebalancing that is gathering momentum via more bank models signalling the same mantra (US and Canadian indices the latest to join the chorus along with UK and Japanese trackers), the Kiwi derived independent impetus from NZ data overnight revealing record exports in March, while the Aussie has rallied in wake of firmer than expected Q1 inflation metrics. Nzd/Usd is hovering just off 0.6100+ peaks and Aud/Usd got to within a whisker of 0.6550 before waning as Aud/Nzd pivots 1.0700 ahead of the NBNZ business survey for April and the DXY holds just above 99.500 within a relatively confined 99.524-884 range in advance of preliminary Q1 US GDP and the Fed.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/JPY/CHF/GBP -</strong> All benefiting at the expense of the Greenback, but to varying degrees. The Euro remains toppy on approach towards 1.0900 amidst contrasting Eurozone economic indicators, German state CPIs inferring an upward bias to consensus for the national number and Italy suffering a ratings downgrade at the hands of Fitch having evaded the same fate from S&amp;P. Note also, Eur/Usd has an array of decent option expiries to navigate pre-FOMC and the ECB on Thursday, with 1 bn at the 1.0800 strike, 1 bn between 1.0815-20 and 1.1 bn at 1.0865 rolling off today. Elsewhere, the Loonie continue to draw encouragement from comparative stability in crude prices and is inching closer to 1.3900, while the Yen has extended its break through 107.00 beyond 106.50 and briefly over a key 50% retracement level at 106.45, albeit in thinner volumes due to Japan’s Showa Day holiday. Meanwhile, the Franc has rebounded further from recent lows and is now eyeing 0.9700, but the Pound is lagging after failing to revisit 1.2500+ highs and maintaining its recovery vs the single currency as Eur/Gbp bounces from sub-0.8700 to circa 0.8745 and back over the 200 DMA in time for the 9 am fix and with month end RHS demand likely to persist.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> The Swedish and Norwegian Krona have both lost a bit of traction, though remain in bullish mode despite Riksbank rhetoric reiterating that ZIRP is not the lower bound and NIER slashing its 2020 GDP estimate to -7% from -3.2% previously, while the latest Norges Bank survey portrays a bleaker picture for Q2 vs Q1 with most respondents reporting weaker activity, and for some a dramatic decline. Conversely, EM currencies are broadly bid on the back of the flagging Buck and Rub due to the aforementioned calmer waters in oil as Russia’s Energy Minister Novak confirms full compliance with the OPEC+ production pact. However, the Try is still underperforming near the 7.0000 handle that is being staunchly defended by the CBRT after a slump in Turkish economic sentiment.</p><p><strong>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: <strong>1.0800 (1BLN),</strong> 1.0810 (400M), <strong>1.0815-20 (1BLN), 1.0865 (1.1BLN)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUD/USD: 0.6435 (800M), <strong>0.6450 (1.8BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>Australian CPI (Q1) Q/Q 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.7%).

However, Italian bonds continue to flounder following Tuesday’s downgrade that pulls the sovereign down another rung just above junk and the ECB’s lower bound.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures </strong>continue their rebound from yesterday’s volatile session, with some desks citing short covering as a potential catalyst. Underlying fundamentals remain unchanged, although firms have been cutting exposure to the front-month contracts amid fears of similar price action in the run-up to the WTI May contract expiry. Yesterday’s API printed another substantial 10mln barrels build in US inventories, but below market expectations. Cushing also showed a lower build than the prior which could provide short-term relief regarding the pace of dwindling storage at the WTI delivery hub. The weekly DoEs will be eyed for confirmation of this. In terms of OPEC, Russian Energy Minister Novak reaffirmed Moscow’s commitment to the output pact but noted that Russian energy firms will be cutting output by around 19% from February levels. Assuming the 11.29mln BPD February output reported by IFAX – this would take production to just over 9mln BPD vs. the 8.5mln BPD output cap agreed with Saudi. Although, Novak added that smaller oil firms will also cut output, which may take production to the threshold. WTI (June) meanders around USD 14/bbl having printed a base at USD 12.67 and a high of USD 14.50/bbl, whilst Brent (July) also trades on a firmer footing, albeit to a much lesser extent, and resides around the middle of its current USD 22.73-23.77/bbl range. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold </strong>trades flat within a tight band just north of USD 1700/oz and remains relatively uneventful ahead of US GDP and the FOMC monetary policy decision. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile benefits from the weaker Buck and reclaimed USD 2.35/lb to the upside. <strong>Zinc</strong> prices continued advancing in overnight trade amid supply woes induced by COVID-19 alongside improving Chinese demand.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks + 10.0mln vs. Exp. +10.6mln (Prev. +13.2mln</strong>).

SMI (-0.4%) sees modest underperformance on the back of large-cap stocks in the red, including Pharma-giants Roche (-1.0%) and Novartis (-0.8%) – which collectively account for just under 40% of the index, and thus pressure is also seen in the pharma sector. Other sectors are mostly mixed and do not reflect a clean risk sentiment. Energy tops the charts amid gains in the oil complex. The sector breakdown also paints the same mixed picture, with Oil &amp; Gas at the top whilst Healthcare lags; Travel &amp; Leisure sees itself in modest positive territory. As mentioned above, the morning saw a flurry of earnings; Airbus (+0.8%) rises despite dismal COVID-impacted numbers including a net loss of EUR 481mln, with potential upside attributed to French Finance Minister alluding to a safety net for the company if needed. Deutsche Bank (+2.2%) sees support from in-line numbers alongside FIC trading topping forecasts. Barclays (+6%) was bolstered at the open as its Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) revenue came in at almost GBP 1bln above forecasts. Other earnings-related movers include: Volkswagen (+2.5%), Daimler (+2.2%), AstraZeneca (+0.8%), AMS (+18.8%) and Nordea Bank (+4.5%).

Elsewhere, the Loonie continue to draw encouragement from comparative stability in crude prices and is inching closer to 1.3900, while the Yen has extended its break through 107.00 beyond 106.50 and briefly over a key 50% retracement level at 106.45, albeit in thinner volumes due to Japan’s Showa Day holiday.

However, Italian bonds continue to flounder following Tuesday’s downgrade that pulls the sovereign down another rung just above junk and the ECB’s lower bound.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures continue their rebound from yesterday’s volatile session, with some desks citing short covering as a potential catalyst. Underlying fundamentals remain unchanged, although firms have been cutting exposure to the front-month contracts amid fears of similar price action in the run-up to the <strong>WTI</strong> May contract expiry. Yesterday’s API printed another substantial 10mln barrels build in US inventories, but below market expectations. Cushing also showed a lower build than the prior which could provide short-term relief regarding the pace of dwindling storage at the <strong>WTI</strong> delivery hub. The weekly DoEs will be eyed for confirmation of this. In terms of OPEC, Russian Energy Minister Novak reaffirmed Moscow’s commitment to the output pact but noted that Russian energy firms will be cutting output by around 19% from February levels. Assuming the 11.29mln BPD February output reported by IFAX – this would take production to just over 9mln BPD vs. the 8.5mln BPD output cap agreed with Saudi. Although, Novak added that smaller oil firms will also cut output, which may take production to the threshold. <strong>WTI</strong> (June) meanders around USD 14/bbl having printed a base at USD 12.67 and a high of USD 14.50/bbl, whilst <strong>Brent</strong> (July) also trades on a firmer footing, albeit to a much lesser extent, and resides around the middle of its current USD 22.73-23.77/bbl range. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> trades flat within a tight band just north of USD 1700/oz and remains relatively uneventful ahead of US GDP and the FOMC monetary policy decision. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile benefits from the weaker Buck and reclaimed USD 2.35/lb to the upside. <strong>Zinc</strong> prices continued advancing in overnight trade amid supply woes induced by COVID-19 alongside improving Chinese demand.</p>",

Ahead, more hefty DMO issuance, but still no reason to assume anything other than ample investor demand even though the supply pipeline is set to get bigger. On that note, details of the May-July schedule are due tomorrow at 7.30BST, and the Gbp180 bn remit will be front-loaded according to the debt office.</p>",

However, a weak start to the midweek session for EU stocks may give the 10 year German debt future more impetus to really test the big figure and chart resistance just above given supportive month-end factors like a long index extension for Eurozone debt and asset rebalancing models showing hefty equity sales in favour of bonds. More immediately, a raft of data is slated ahead of the FOMC, plus Italian and German issuance that could prompt a bit more concession even though the ECB has pre-empted sovereign downgrades to BB.</p>",

A positive risk tone in the European session kept yields slightly elevated, although as US participants stepped in, the bid made headway. The UST strength was likely a function of equity bourses coming off their highs as well as participants taking advantage of Treasury supply out the way and higher yields ahead of the FOMC, where there is a chance the Fed could hint at some form of YCC and tweak its current programmes; however, the base case is for the Fed to announce such measures at the June meeting instead. Additionally, another chunky fall in LIBOR saw the front-end lead the rally, particularly white pack Eurodollars, as market participants continue to lower their forecasts for funding costs to that of a level closer to the FFR. By settlement, the yield curve had flattened: 2s -2bps at 0.21%, while both 10s and 30s fell by 4.5bps to 0.61% and 1.20%, respectively.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher and US equity futures also recover from the tech-led declines on Wall St, with the US tech giants making atonement after-hours following Alphabet earnings which missed on EPS but topped revenue forecasts. ASX 200 (+1.3%) is lifted by outperformance in energy after a rebound in oil prices and as the top-weighted financials sector also notches firm gains, while KOSPI (+1.0%) is underpinned by strong data including a surprise expansion in Industrial Production with participants also digesting earnings including Samsung Electronics which fell short of estimates for Q1 net, although operating profit printed inline and revenue beat forecasts. Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) are positive amid a heavy slate of earnings including 3 of the big 4 banks which all showed an improvement from a year ago, with sentiment in Hong Kong also jubilant ahead of the extended weekend. There were also reports the National People’s Congress will begin from May 22nd after conditions for holding the annual parliament meeting were met amid improved control and prevention of the coronavirus outbreak and where officials are anticipated to announce a new stimulus package and set this year’s growth targets. As a reminder, Japan is shut today for Showa Day, while Hong Kong and South Korea will begin an extended weekend after today’s close.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains softer following the recent decline below the 100.00 level which later acted as resistance, with participants also kept tentative heading into month-end and with US GDP and the FOMC announcements scheduled later today. This has benefitted the greenback’s major counterparts with EUR/USD breaking above its 200-Hour MA to test 1.0850 despite the sovereign rating cut by Fitch on Italy to the lowest investment grade of BBB-; Outlook Stable, and GBP/USD also strengthened with the pair undeterred by BRC data which showed UK retailers reduced non-food prices Y/Y by the most on record. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is on the backfoot amid the USD-woes and the absence of Japanese participants, while antipodeans are buoyed by the risk appetite, rebound in oil and after encouraging data including relatively inline New Zealand Trade figures and firmer than expected Australian CPI which showed headline Y/Y inflation increased to 2.2% from 1.8% although the RBA’s preferred Trimmed Mean CPI of 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.6% remained below the central bank’s 2%-3% target.</p>",
