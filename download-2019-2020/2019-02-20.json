The minutes also stated many Fed officials were unsure what rate moves may be needed this year and that several officials see a 2019 rate hike if the economy remains on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, officials signalled concern on trade, fiscal policy and the government shutdown, while they noted some downside risks had increased and business investment had moderated but also mentioned there was a strong labour market, inflation is near target and recent household data has been strong.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&rsquo;s demand for stable yuan to end US-China trade war is &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; to Beijing.

Furthermore, UK PM May and EC President Juncker said Brexit talks were constructive and the two discussed what guarantees could be provided to give reassurance Irish backstop was temporary in nature. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Tory MPs Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston resigned from the Conservative Party and joined the Independent Group, while they stated that there will be times when they support the Government and cited Brexit as the reason for leaving.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said global growth deceleration is likely to continue and that the Fed should pause rate hikes in order to see how economic uncertainty looks. Kaplan further commented that the weaker business outlook is the reason for his caution on rates and that the yield curve is signalling sluggish expectations for growth. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CVS Health (CVS) nosedived after reporting a miss on revenue estimates as well as lowering FY19 guidance; competitor Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) also dipped. Concho Resources (CXO) slipped on a miss on top and bottom line. Garmin (GRMN) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates and raising guidance. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Devon Energy (DVN), Host Hotels (HST) and Analog Devices (ADI) all outperformed after reporting earnings. Walmart (WMT) traded lower after reports its UK supermarket Asda could have its merger with Sainsbury&rsquo;s blocked by UK regulators. Broker moves saw CenturyLink (CTL), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Ecolab (ECL) all open lower following downgrades at RBC, UBS and JPMorgan respectively. Tesla (TSLA) underperformed on news that its General Counsel Butswinkas has left the firm after just two months in the position. Southwest Airlines (LUV) was in the red after cutting its guidance, also suffering from a downgrade at Goldman Sachs. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) continued its rally on a bullish copper outlook. Altria (MO) traded higher after reaffirming guidance at the CAGNY conference. In later trade, Constellation Brands (STZ) fell off on it reporting guidance for its beer business at the CAGNY conference. SPX +0.18% at 2785, NDX -0.06% at 7062, DJI +0.25% at 25956.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At settlement, the Treasury curve was slightly negative, with newswires attributing the moves to comments in the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes that signal 21019 rate hikes are still possible. Earlier in the session there was some focus on a 10s30s steepening trade (18k in the TYH9 vs 4k in the ultra longs). At settle, the curve was slightly steeper, with analysts noting 2s10s spread seems to be capped by its 50 day moving average. Some had also attributed higher yields to a slate of investment grade corporate supply, which pressured the long-end. US T-note futures (H9) settled 2 ticks lower at 122-05.</p>\r\n",

The committee wanted to make clear it was flexible in its approach to normalising the balance sheet, and Fed staff gave options for ending the balance sheet runoff in H2 2019. Almost all Fed officials wanted to halt runoff later this year. The minutes said the labour market remained strong, inflation was near target, recent household data was been strong, although Fed officials note business investment had moderated. With that said, it still sees continued sustained expansion. Officials said that a patient approach would allow time for a clear picture. Officials cited concerns on trade, fiscal policy and the govt shutdown, noting some downside risks had increased. IT said that it was important to continue monitoring financial market conditions. On rates, several officials see a 2019 rate hike if the economy remains on track, while many Fed officials unsure what rate moves may be needed this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ANALYSIS: FOMC MEETING MINUTES:</strong> The FOMC&#39;s January meeting minutes were released directly on the Fed&#39;s website, and not a media lock-up due to weather conditions. It made the release an awkward affair, with fragmented headlines crossing as the market looked ot the minutes directly. Accordingly, analysts may also be delayed in providing their assessment of hte minutes. At first glance, the release seems to be a touch hawkish, if judged on market reaction (ES fluctuated to HOD and near LOD within a short frame of time before going to unchanged levels vs pre-release of the minutes; Treasuries were lower and the USD index firmed). As the minutes were digested, the dovish elements were highlighted, and risk assets found some cautious bids. With regards to the minutes themselves, the initial assessment is that they seem to confirm some of the dovish remarks officials have made as of late, though this will be of little surprise given the 180 since December. The significant new development, however, was that officials are tilting towards ending the balance sheet run-off in 2019, as some officials had recently suggested. However, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot that hinted the FOMC was on the cusp of easing policy any time soon, with the central bank noting that the labour market was strong, inflation was near target, and recent household data was strong, although it was noted that business investment had moderated. Indeed, the minutes stated that several officials saw a 2019 rate hike if the economy remains on track. The minutes once again highlighted the risks the Fed was facing at the January meeting (government shutdown, trade, fiscal policy) and the FOMC stated that some downside risks had increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Vice Chair Clarida (voter) does not think that a change in Fed policy statements represents a U-Turn, and the December rate hike was not a mistake; says it is unclear how much of a US growth slowdown we are seeing. Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said the Fed should pause rate hikes in order to see how economic uncertainty looks, citing the weaker business outlook is the reason for his caution; also saying global growth deceleration is likely to continue and the yield curve signalling sluggish growth expectations too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump said he will hit the EU with auto tariffs if no deal can be reached. Trump said talks were ongoing and EU was a tough negotiator. Trump reiterated he is trying to do a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May and EC President Juncker says Brexit talks were constructive; the two discussed what guarantees could be provided to give reassurance Irish backstop was temporary in nature; May added that she underlined the need for legally binding changes to the backstop to EU&#39;s Juncker. Elsewhere, EU&#39;s Tusk says delay of Brexit is better than no deal Brexit, adds that he hopes UK realises no deal Brexit is unacceptable. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Borrell brought the market optimistic comments on Wednesday where he said a Brexit accord is being &ldquo;hammered out&rdquo; in Brussels, reiterating that the EU doesn&rsquo;t want the agreement re-opened but it &ldquo;can be interpreted, or complemented with explanations&rdquo;. UK PM May arrived in Brussels for talks today, her and EU Commission President Tusk said Brexit talks were constructive; the two discussed what guarantees could be provided to give reassurance that the Irish backstop was temporary in nature, however there was no material breakthroughs. It was reported that the EU wants proof that UK MPs are willing to back the revised deal before EU leaders sign off on deal changes, indicating that the EU is taking PM May&rsquo;s proposed changes seriously. Although cable saw this as a positive, it&rsquo;s worth highlighting that parliament is as divided as ever, with four Tory MPs resigning this morning &ndash; with more rumoured to follow suit - to join the several opposition Labour MPs who resigned yesterday, forming the Independent Group, also May lost a vote of approval for her Brexit deal just last week in parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EZ CONSUMER SENTIMENT: </strong>The Eurozone prelim consumer sentiment data for February was better-than-expected, coming in at -7.4 from a prior -7.9 (consensus -7.8). &quot;We&rsquo;ll take the wins when we can at the moment in the EZ data, and this headline counts as one even though it is a rather small victory in light of last month&rsquo;s downward revision,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics said. The consultancy notes that political uncertainty remains a drag on household confidence, but other fundamentals are improving. &quot;Real wage growth likely is rising thanks to lower headline inflation, and tax cuts and higher minimum wages are helping in France and Spain.&quot; After a decent ZEW survey this week (the forward-looking components were encouraging), and an upside surprise with consumer sentiment, traders will be looking for a confirmation of these positive signs in tomorrow&#39;s round of PMIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SOUTH AFRICA BUDGET:</strong> Headline deficit numbers disappointed, but SOE announcements and wage bill cut surprise positively on net, Goldman Sachs said. Budget showed deterioration in near-term fiscal and growth forecasts, left medium-term projections and debt trajectory roughly unchanged. &quot;These headline fiscal announcements came as a disappointment to our and &ndash; judging from the initial market reaction &ndash; market expectations,&quot; Goldman Sachs said, &quot;however, news relating to National Treasury&#39;s financial support package for Eskom appears to have come as a positive surprise to market expectations, given South African asset prices retraced their initial losses and, on net, strengthened.&quot; Finance Minister Mboweni said Eskom would receive capital injections over a three-year period amounting to ZAR 69bln, but added that the government would refrain from any outright nationalisation of Eskom&#39;s debt. Mboweni also announced an independent Chief Reorganisation Officer would be appointed at Eskom in the coming weeks, with a mandate to deliver on recommendations from the Presidential task force on Eskom, and any financial support would be contingent on this appointment. &quot;Minister Mboweni&#39;s broader message on SOEs &ndash; of limited further sovereign support, and the need to rethink SOE policy and incorporate private participation &ndash; also surprised market expectations positively,&quot; and Goldman thinks the credibility of the broader turnaround plan will hinge on upcoming announcements relating to the firm&#39;s reorganisation and efforts to address costs. &quot;In our base case scenario, this plan will be sufficiently credible for Moody&#39;s to refrain from shifting its outlook on the sovereign credit rating to negative at its upcoming review on March 29,&quot; GS wrote, adding that &quot;the risk to this view is that execution and sequencing of the turnaround plan may be complicated by the upcoming election (scheduled for May 8).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BRAZIL: </strong>In recent weeks, there have been notable inflows into Brazilian assets in the hope that new Brazil President Bolsonaro will deliver meaningful pension reform to ensure Brazil can meet its pension obligations (something which would become problematic in 2021 absent of reform) as well as get its public finances in order. Bolsonaro today presented his reform bill, which aims to lift the retirement age for men to 65 and for women to 62 (as was flagged in news reports last week). Hi plan would save some BRL 1trln over a ten year horizon, he suggested. The process has now begun, and will need to be voted on by lawmakers; since it is a constitutional bill, it means it will need to be voted on twice in the Lower House (Chamber of Deputies) and the Upper House (Senate) with a 60% majority each time. The implication is that it would need 308 of the 513 lawmakers in Congress to back the legislation, although current polling suggests only around 250 support the measure. Accordingly, there are now fears that the bill could be watered down to ensure its passage through Congress. Bolsonaro&#39;s ability to push through reforms has come into question this week, after the President sacked a key cabinet member. However, analysts reason that markets would be happy with savings over BRL 700bln, and would be disappointed with any figure below BRL 500bln, with the final figure seen somewhere between BRL 500-600bln, according to Goldman Sachs. RBC analysts see the bill clearing the Lower House in June, before going through the Upper House in August. Analysts have argued that if Bolsonaro is successful, it could pave the way for Brazil to regain its investment grade rating, which it lost in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) settles $0.71 higher at $57.16/bbl, Brent (J9) settles $0.63 higher at $67.08/bbl. </strong>Oil prices drifted lower in early trade on Wednesday before reversing losses and rallying into and through the US session ahead of the FOMC meeting minutes. The supply side of the equation provided a tailwind for the market with reports on the OPEC+ deal and Nigerian supply cuts, whilst an absence of US-China trade updates removed headline risk. Additionally, analysts at Citi note &ldquo;with March WTI crude oil expiring, book squaring via associated outright trade flows and spread relationships&rdquo; were a component of today&rsquo;s trade. Breaking down the supply factors, Nigerian President Buhari said today that Nigeria is willing to cut oil production in order to secure higher prices. These comments come ahead of the national elections scheduled for this weekend (after a delay from last weekend) wherein Buhari is marginally leading in polls; this is also amid suggestions that the Niger Delta Avengers are to &quot;cripple the economy&quot; &ndash; by targeting pipelines - if Buhari is re-elected. Elsewhere, an OPEC+ technical committee sees January compliance with the deal at 83%, this is compared to an expected 70% according to a Reuters poll from January 31st. After the close on Wednesday the delayed weekly APIs will be released, where crude inventories are seen building 3.2mln barrels, distillates drawing 1.7mln, gasoline drawing 1.1mln; Genscape&rsquo;s forecast for Cushing stocks was reportedly a build of 0.8mln barrels. Analysts at PVM highlight crude stockpiles are currently above the year-ago level as well as the five-year average, causing more downward pressure on WTI compared to its European counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.18% at 2785, NDX -0.06% at 7062, DJI +0.25% at 25956. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.44%, Materials +1.70%, Industrials +0.50%, Cons Discretionary +0.15%, Cons Staples -0.07%, Healthcare -0.12%, Financials +0.59%, Tech +0.04%, Telecoms -0.06%, Utilities +0.46%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>CVS Health (CVS) nosedived after reporting a miss on revenue estimates as well as lowering FY19 guidance; competitor Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) also dipped. Concho Resources (CXO) slipped on a miss on top and bottom line. Garmin (GRMN) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates and raising guidance. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Devon Energy (DVN), Host Hotels (HST) and Analog Devices (ADI) all outperformed after reporting earnings. Walmart (WMT) traded lower after reports its UK supermarket Asda could have its merger with Sainsbury&rsquo;s blocked by UK regulators. Broker moves saw CenturyLink (CTL), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Ecolab (ECL) all open lower following downgrades at RBC, UBS and JPMorgan respectively. Tesla (TSLA) underperformed on news that its General Counsel Butswinkas has left the firm after just two months in the position. Southwest Airlines (LUV) was in the red after cutting its guidance, also suffering from a downgrade at Goldman Sachs. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) continued its rally on a bullish copper outlook. Altria (MO) traded higher after reaffirming guidance at the CAGNY conference. In later trade, Constellation Brands (STZ) fell off on it reporting guidance for its beer business at the CAGNY conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 2 TICKS LOWER AT 122-05. </strong>At settlement, the Treasury curve was slightly negative, with newswires attributing the moves to comments in the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes that signal 21019 rate hikes are still possible. Earlier in the session there was some focus on a 10s30s steepening trade (18k in the TYH9 vs 4k in the ultra longs). At settle, the curve was slightly steeper, with analysts noting 2s10s spread seems to be capped by its 50 day moving average. Some had also attributed higher yields to a slate of investment grade corporate supply, which pressured the long-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Not a great deal of deviation from early EU session ranges for USD/major pairings, Indeed, the DXY is locked in a tight 96.280-96.647, with focus on the key technical level at 96.525, a level we rose to in wake of the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>USDCAD heads into APAC trade near the bottom of its daily range, outpacing its G10 counterparts largely due to the Greenback&rsquo;s retracement and holding recovery gains through 1.3200, as the Loonie decouples somewhat from oil that remains in consolidation following the recent rebound to fresh ytd highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, JPY, NZD:</strong> Cable stalled and drifted back towards 1.3000 from a circa 1.3075 peak in wake of three more defections to the newly formed Independent Group in Parliament, and this time from UK PM May&rsquo;s Tory party. Moreover, the Pound succumbed to some profit-taking and caution going in to the Premier&rsquo;s Brexit meeting with EU&rsquo;s Juncker, with Eur/Gbp back around 0.8700 vs almost 0.8675 at one stage before reports from Spain alluded to an agreement being hammered out gave Sterling another boost. Conversely, the Jpy has pared some losses from just shy of 111.00 lows vs the Usd after disappointing Japanese trade data overnight (exports especially weak) and BoJ Governor Kuroda&rsquo;s dovish insinuations earlier in the week, and the Kiwi has also regained composure partly at the expense of its US peer to hover closer to the top of its 0.6885-50 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, EUR, AUD: </strong>Narrowly mixed vs the Buck, and the Franc now turning full circle from recent lows around 1.1000 to through parity, while the single currency appears to have established a better foothold above 1.1300 in the face of more dovish ECB rhetoric just ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s minutes and Italian political divergence over the 2019 budget (Salvini not inclined to revisit the statement/projections, but Tria holding out until the official review in April). Elsewhere, Aud/Usd has also based and eyeing the upper end of a 0.7180-40 trading band after initial declines on the back of sub-consensus Aussie wage data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> The rand initially dumped on news that South Africa would inject less funds into ailing utility Eskom, however, it turned around and then moved positive on the day, with analysts noting that despite he combination of lower growth and larger borrowing requirements, the Eskom injection would put less pressure on public finances than previously expected (ZAR 100bln was hoped for, though Eskom only got ZAR 69bln over a three year period), and diminishes fears of an immediate sovereign downgrade. However, downside risks still remain, and the key takeaway from the Budget seems to be a message of &#39;lower growth and higher borrowing&#39;. USDZAR initially rose to 14.37 after the announcement, rising to January highs, before dropping below the 14.00 figure as the details were digested. (See above for analysis)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BRL: </strong>the Real also netted a gain (through 3.7000 at best) after Brazil&rsquo;s pension reform bill marginally raised the bar for planned savings, but the BRL couldn&rsquo;t remain beneath that level, as traders noted that there remain obstacles to passing pension reform, and any final deal is likely to be watered down vs what the government presented today. (See above for analysis)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The FOMC&#39;s January meeting minutes were released directly on the Fed&#39;s website, and not a media lock-up due to weather conditions. It made the release an awkward affair, with fragmented headlines crossing as the market looked ot the minutes directly. Accordingly, analysts may also be delayed in providing their assessment of hte minutes. At first glance, the release seems to be a touch hawkish, if judged on market reaction (ES fluctuated to HOD and near LOD within a short frame of time before going to unchanged levels vs pre-release of the minutes; Treasuries were lower and the USD index firmed). As the minutes were digested, the dovish elements were highlighted, and risk assets found some cautious bids. With regards to the minutes themselves, the initial assessment is that they seem to confirm some of the dovish remarks officials have made as of late, though this will be of little surprise given the 180 since December. <strong>The significant new development, however, was that officials are tilting towards ending the balance sheet run-off in 2019, as some officials had recently suggested. </strong>However, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot that hinted the FOMC was on the cusp of easing policy any time soon, with the central bank noting that the labour market was strong, inflation was near target, and recent household data was strong, although it was noted that business investment had moderated. Indeed, the minutes stated that several officials saw a 2019 rate hike if the economy remains on track. The minutes once again highlighted the risks the Fed was facing at the January meeting (government shutdown, trade, fiscal policy) and the FOMC stated that some downside risks had increased.</p>\r\n",

The supply side of the equation provided a tailwind for the market with reports on the OPEC+ deal and Nigerian supply cuts, whilst an absence of US-China trade updates removed headline risk. Additionally, analysts at Citi note &ldquo;with March WTI crude oil expiring, book squaring via associated outright trade flows and spread relationships&rdquo; were a component of today&rsquo;s trade. Breaking down the supply factors, Nigerian President Buhari said today that Nigeria is willing to cut oil production in order to secure higher prices. These comments come ahead of the national elections scheduled for this weekend (after a delay from last weekend) wherein Buhari is marginally leading in polls; this is also amid suggestions that the Niger Delta Avengers are to &quot;cripple the economy&quot; &ndash; by targeting pipelines - if Buhari is re-elected. Elsewhere, an OPEC+ technical committee sees January compliance with the deal at 83%, this is compared to an expected 70% according to a Reuters poll from January 31st. After the close on Wednesday the delayed weekly APIs will be released, where crude inventories are seen building 3.2mln barrels, distillates drawing 1.7mln, gasoline drawing 1.1mln; Genscape&rsquo;s forecast for Cushing stocks was reportedly a build of 0.8mln barrels. Analysts at PVM highlight crude stockpiles are currently above the year-ago level as well as the five-year average, causing more downward pressure on WTI compared to its European counterpart.</p>\r\n",

Mboweni also announced an independent Chief Reorganisation Officer would be appointed at Eskom in the coming weeks, with a mandate to deliver on recommendations from the Presidential task force on Eskom, and any financial support would be contingent on this appointment. &quot;Minister Mboweni&#39;s broader message on SOEs &ndash; of limited further sovereign support, and the need to rethink SOE policy and incorporate private participation &ndash; also surprised market expectations positively,&quot; and Goldman thinks the credibility of the broader turnaround plan will hinge on upcoming announcements relating to the firm&#39;s reorganisation and efforts to address costs. &quot;In our base case scenario, this plan will be sufficiently credible for Moody&#39;s to refrain from shifting its outlook on the sovereign credit rating to negative at its upcoming review on March 29,&quot; GS wrote, adding that &quot;the risk to this view is that execution and sequencing of the turnaround plan may be complicated by the upcoming election (scheduled for May 8).&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>In recent weeks, there have been notable inflows into Brazilian assets in the hope that new Brazil President Bolsonaro will deliver meaningful pension reform to ensure Brazil can meet its pension obligations (something which would become problematic in 2021 absent of reform) as well as get its public finances in order. Bolsonaro today presented his reform bill, which aims to lift the retirement age for men to 65 and for women to 62 (as was flagged in news reports last week). Hi plan would save some BRL 1trln over a ten year horizon, he suggested. The process has now begun, and will need to be voted on by lawmakers; since it is a constitutional bill, it means it will need to be voted on twice in the Lower House (Chamber of Deputies) and the Upper House (Senate) with a 60% majority each time. The implication is that it would need 308 of the 513 lawmakers in the Chamber to back the legislation, although current polling suggests only around 250 support the measure. Accordingly, there are now fears that the bill could be watered down to ensure its passage through Congress. Bolsonaro&#39;s ability to push through reforms has come into question this week, after the President sacked a key cabinet member. However, analysts reason that markets would be happy with savings over BRL 700bln, and would be disappointed with any figure below BRL 500bln, with the final figure seen somewhere between BRL 500-600bln, according to Goldman Sachs. RBC analysts see the bill clearing the Lower House in June, before oing through the Upper House in August. Analysts have argued that if Bolsonaro is successful, it could pave the way for Brazil to regain its investment grade rating, which it lost in 2015.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>G10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a great deal of deviation from early EU session ranges for Usd/major pairings, as the focus remains largely on events to come, including the latest instalment of the UK-EU Brexit saga from Brussels and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the DXY is locked in a tight 96.647-437 range and currently sitting just above a key technical level at 96.525, awaiting more fundamental direction from the aforementioned account of the Fed&rsquo;s last policy meeting, and with most expecting to see confirmation of the switch to pause and patient mode, plus any more deliberations/guidance about curtailing balance sheet run-offs sooner than previously flagged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off best levels, but still outpacing its G10 counterparts largely due to the Greenback&rsquo;s retracement and holding recovery gains through 1.3200, as the Loonie decouples somewhat from oil that remains in consolidation following the recent rebound to fresh ytd highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable stalled and drifted back towards 1.3000 from a circa 1.3075 peak in wake of 3 more defections to the newly formed Independent Group in Parliament, and this time from UK PM May&rsquo;s Tory party. Moreover, the Pound succumbed to some profit-taking and caution going in to the Premier&rsquo;s Brexit meeting with EU&rsquo;s Juncker at 17.30GMT, with Eur/Gbp back around 0.8700 vs almost 0.8675 at one stage before unconfirmed or substantiated reports from Spain alluding to an agreement being hammered out gave Sterling another boost. Conversely, the Jpy has pared some losses from just shy of 111.00 lows vs the Usd after disappointing Japanese trade data overnight (exports especially weak) and BoJ Governor Kuroda&rsquo;s dovish insinuations earlier in the week, and the Kiwi has also regained composure partly at the expense of its US peer to hover closer to the top of its 0.6885-50 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed vs the Buck, and the Franc now turning full circle from recent lows around 1.1000 to test parity, while the single currency appears to have established a better foothold above 1.1300 in the face of more dovish ECB rhetoric just ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s minutes and Italian political divergence over the 2019 budget (Salvini not inclined to revisit the statement/projections, but Tria holding out until the official review in April). Elsewhere, Aud/Usd has also based and eyeing the upper end of a 0.7175-40 trading band after initial declines on the back of sub-consensus Aussie wage data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but certainly not least in terms of price action, volatility and in the case of the Rand a really dramatic change in fortunes. Indeed, Usd/Zar rallied from around 14.1400 as the 2019 SA budget showed downgrades to growth forecasts and higher budget deficit/borrowing projections, reaching 14.3700 at one stage, but then reversed all and more of the move to trade under 14.0000 on reflection and as some comfort was derived from the fact that the Government did not underwrite Eskom to the tune of Rand 100 bn, providing a more reserved/measured Rand 69 bn over 3 years instead. Elsewhere in the region, the Real also netted a gain (through 3.7000 at best) after Brazil&rsquo;s pension reform bill marginally raised the bar for planned savings, but the Lira failed to sustain moves above 5.3000 after Turkish current account data revealed a record shortfall.</p>\r\n",

Some suggest progress will be limited ahead of the Carnival on 6 March.</li>\r\n  <li>Informa suggests that there are three themes to watch: Will the reform speed up convergence of public and private sector retirement rules?

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were mixed with Australia dragged lower by continued underperformance in Consumer Staples after Woolworth shares slumped more than 5% post-earnings, while Tokyo stocks were propped up as the impact of a weaker currency eclipsed the concerns from the steepest decline in Japanese Exports for more than 2 years. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) were also varied as the mainland lagged despite the PBoC announcement of its first liquidity injection since before the Lunar New Year, as the amount was a relatively paltry CNY 20bln and with participants also kept tentative ahead of upcoming senior level trade discussions between US and China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with price action contained by an indecisive risk tone in the region and after having recently hit resistance at 153.00, while the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributed to the lacklustre trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7558 (Prev. 6.7642)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Premier Li states that China has not and will not change monetary policy; will not resort to &#39;flood-like&#39; stimulus. RRR cut in January reflected that there is sufficient room for cuts. Adding that increasing bill financing and short-term loans may create the potential for risks.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PM May is reportedly to present the EU with fresh legal proposals to break the Irish backstop deadlock and which will hopefully convince Brexiteers to support her deal. In related news, a spokesperson said PM May and Brexit Ministers updated cabinet on Brexit and that the UK is still looking to reopen the withdrawal agreement. (Telegraph/Guardian/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Tory MPs Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston have resigned from the Conservative Party and joined the Independent Group; talkRadio&#39;s Kempsell confirms. Prior to this, ITV&#39;s Peston tweets that if, as he expects, four Tory MPs quit the party today to become independent, PM May&#39;s minority government will become even more of a minority, with less grips on the Commons, so a general election moves nearer. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would be mutual calamity for UK and EU, while he also noted that the most urgent task is to reach an agreement that will protect trading relationship with EU. Furthermore, Hammond said the Malthouse initiative is a valuable effort to allay backstop concerns in the future but added that EU will not consider a replacement to the backstop now. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sky&rsquo;s Political Correspondent McCann tweeted that UK&#39;s new legal proposals may not be presented to the EU on Wednesday and could instead be on Thursday or Friday. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutch MPs warned EU to prepare for the worst regarding Brexit as they were left with the impression UK politics is &quot;locked in the mother of all chicken games&quot; and &quot;a mess&quot; following a visit to Westminster.

Adding that forming a European Parliament involving the coalition parties 5SM and League would be a &quot;good idea&quot; and is looking to create a strong &quot;euro-critic&quot; group, and that the League party is not considering forming a single group with 5 star at the European Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major indices in Europe have somewhat waned off earlier highs [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%] following a relatively indecisive Asia-Pac session. Sectors are mixed with outperformance in industrials given the price action in the base metal complex, while energy names marginally lag their peers. In terms of notable movers, Sainsbury&rsquo;s (-15.6%) shares plumbed the depths after the supermarket was dealt a blow by the UK CMA, which stated that the proposed Sainsbury&rsquo;s-Asda has extensive competition concerns, whilst adding that the two companies will have to shut a significant number of stores or face rejection. The companies now have until 13th March to respond to the CMA&#39;s findings, with a final report by the CMA to be issued by 30th April. Elsewhere, Swedbank (-11.8%) has become the latest financial institute embroiled in the Danske Bank (-1.2%) money laundering scandal, following reports of the Co. being linked to USD 4.3bln in illicit transfers. Finally, regarding earnings-driven stocks, Glencore (-1.2%) gave up initial gains as indices came off highs, while Lloyds (+4.1%) maintained its positive at the top of the FTSE amid a GBP 1.75bln share buyback programme alongside a dividend hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD -The Greenback has regained some poise after its relatively pronounced downturn late yesterday amidst uncharacteristically dovish comments from Fed&rsquo;s Mester regarding balance sheet run-offs, as she intimated a willingness to back an end to QT by or even before the end of 2019, albeit keeping options open for a 25 bp hike later this year. However, the index remains depressed and not far off sub-96.500 lows in anticipation that the upcoming FOMC minutes will reiterate the shift in policy guidance to a pause in normalisation and patience before any further adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY/NZD/GBP - All on the backfoot vs the Usd, or paring gains to be more precise, as Aud/Usd eases back towards 0.7150 from circa 0.7175 at best in wake of moderately softer than forecast Q4 Aussie wage data overnight. Meanwhile, a bigger than expected Japanese trade deficit due to the worst export showing since October 2016 compounded post-BoJ Governor Kuroda Jpy weakness as it slips a bit further towards 111.00, but again could glean some traction from option expiry interest given 1.1 bn rolling off between 110.75-85 at the NY cut. Indeed, the Kiwi and Pound are marginally underperforming as Nzd/Usd hovers near the bottom end of a 0.6885-63 range and the Aud/Nzd cross consolidates recovery gains above 1.0400, while Cable runs out of steam ahead of 1.3100 having spiked from sub-1.2900 through 1.3000 in double quick time on Tuesday and topping out around 1.3075 ahead of today&rsquo;s UK PM May-EU Juncker showdown later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR - The Loonie continues to reap the most from pre-Fed minutes US Dollar defensive positioning and remains close to multi-week peaks above 1.3200 even though crude prices have encountered more offers/resistance around 2019 highs, while the single currency has formed a firmer base over 1.1300 having closed above a 1.1313 Fib and now eyeing another resistance level at 1.1362 for a stronger bullish technical signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Contrasting performances for the Yuan and Rand, as the former draws momentum from a stronger PBoC fix, fresh liquidity and positivity surrounding US-China trade talks to test 6.7200 levels vs the Usd, but pre-budget jitters hit the latter with the Zar down to 14.1500 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for core debt, as Bunds and Gilts both extend gains after several dips and periods of sideways trade, albeit with latest peaks not quite as lofty vs Tuesday&rsquo;s session highs. The Eurex and Liffe pinnacles currently stand at 166.69 and 124.18 respectively, with the core Eurozone bond bolstered by a solid Bobl auction even though the 5-year future is underperforming amidst post-sale hedge unwinding. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remains firm and nearer overnight highs with the curve flatter in the run up to FOMC minutes and with short end supply to absorb in the form of Usd18 bn 2-year FRNs. Note also, Fed speakers on tap via Kaplan, Bullard and Daly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.4%) and WTI (-0.3%) prices are subdued after being rangebound throughout the Asia session where WTI reached 2019 highs of USD 56.39.bbl, as markets await today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes and the beginning of high-level US-China trade talks tomorrow with USTR Lighthizer. The EIA forecasts that US total shale regions oil production will average 8.3938mln barrels in March, which is 84mln barrels above February&rsquo;s estimate of 8.31mln barrels. Separately, there have been reports of a fire at a PDVSA crude pumping station, which has a 300k BPD capacity; although, as details surrounding the fire are sparse the impact on production is currently unclear. Looking ahead, API&rsquo;s weekly inventory numbers are to be released today due to the US market holiday on Monday, market expectations are that US crude oil inventories increased over the prior week by 3.1mln barrels. Note, some abnormality may be observed today in WTI trading due to the expiration of the March WTO contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is trading within a thin USD 5/oz range, as the yellow metal follows cautiousness seen in the dollar ahead of today&rsquo;s FOMC. Elsewhere, spot-Palladium has convincingly moved above the USD 1500/oz level reaching USD 1504.46/oz; as the metals 7-month rally, which has been driven by a supply shortage, continues. Separately, German inspection frim TUV SUD has stated that it will no longer certify Vale owned tailings dams, following a Vale owned dam bursting last month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keystone oil pipeline has restarted with 20% pressure reduction, according to US regulator PHMSA.

Note also, Fed speakers on tap via Kaplan, Bullard and Daly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.4%) and WTI (-0.3%) prices are subdued after being rangebound throughout the Asia session where WTI reached 2019 highs of USD 56.39.bbl, as markets await today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes and the beginning of high-level US-China trade talks tomorrow with USTR Lighthizer. The EIA forecasts that US total shale regions oil production will average 8.3938mln barrels in March, which is 84mln barrels above February&rsquo;s estimate of 8.31mln barrels. Separately, there have been reports of a fire at a PDVSA crude pumping station, which has a 300k BPD capacity; although, as details surrounding the fire are sparse the impact on production is currently unclear. Looking ahead, API&rsquo;s weekly inventory numbers are to be released today due to the US market holiday on Monday, market expectations are that US crude oil inventories increased over the prior week by 3.1mln barrels. Note, some abnormality may be observed today in WTI trading due to the expiration of the March WTO contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is trading within a thin USD 5/oz range, as the yellow metal follows cautiousness seen in the dollar ahead of today&rsquo;s FOMC. Elsewhere, spot-Palladium has convincingly moved above the USD 1500/oz level reaching USD 1504.46/oz; as the metals 7-month rally, which has been driven by a supply shortage, continues. Separately, German inspection frim TUV SUD has stated that it will no longer certify Vale owned tailings dams, following a Vale owned dam bursting last month.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has regained some poise after its relatively pronounced downturn late yesterday amidst uncharacteristically dovish comments from Fed&rsquo;s Mester regarding balance sheet run-offs, as she intimated a willingness to back an end to QT by or even before the end of 2019, albeit keeping options open for a 25 bp hike later this year. However, the index remains depressed and not far off sub-96.500 lows in anticipation that the upcoming FOMC minutes will reiterate the shift in policy guidance to a pause in normalisation and patience before any further adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY/NZD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All on the backfoot vs the Usd, or paring gains to be more precise, as Aud/Usd eases back towards 0.7150 from circa 0.7175 at best in wake of moderately softer than forecast Q4 Aussie wage data overnight. Meanwhile, a bigger than expected Japanese trade deficit due to the worst export showing since October 2016 compounded post-BoJ Governor Kuroda Jpy weakness as it slips a bit further towards 111.00, but again could glean some traction from option expiry interest given 1.1 bn rolling off between 110.75-85 at the NY cut. Indeed, the Kiwi and Pound are marginally underperforming as Nzd/Usd hovers near the bottom end of a 0.6885-63 range and the Aud/Nzd cross consolidates recovery gains above 1.0400, while Cable runs out of steam ahead of 1.3100 having spiked from sub-1.2900 through 1.3000 in double quick time on Tuesday and topping out around 1.3075 ahead of today&rsquo;s UK PM May-EU Juncker showdown later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to reap the most from pre-Fed minutes US Dollar defensive positioning and remains close to multi-week peaks above 1.3200 even though crude prices have encountered more offers/resistance around 2019 highs, while the single currency has formed a firmer base over 1.1300 having closed above a 1.1313 Fib and now eyeing another resistance level at 1.1362 for a stronger bullish technical signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting performances for the Yuan and Rand, as the former draws momentum from a stronger PBoC fix, fresh liquidity and positivity surrounding US-China trade talks to test 6.7200 levels vs the Usd, but pre-budget jitters hit the latter with the Zar down to 14.1500 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa&rsquo;s budget deficit is around 4% of GDP while government debt is just under 60% of GDP. Given the country&rsquo;s low economic growth and slow recovery, the debacle regarding state-owned utility company Eskom throws a spanner in the works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eskom</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market expects the Finance Minister to announce a bailout for cash-strapped Eskom in the wake of several weeks of controlled and rotating power outages which, Commerzbank analysts note, &ldquo;has increased concerns about the economy&rdquo;. &nbsp;As a recap, SA President Ramaphosa, in his State of Nation Address, announced that the government will &ldquo;support Eskom&rsquo;s balance sheet&rdquo;, adding that the Finance Minister will provide further details in the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to years of low economic growth (January inflation figures released this morning saw the headline cool to 4.0% from 4.5%, below analyst forecasts of 4.3%), alongside woes over the country&rsquo;s debt/GDP ratio and further tax collection shortfalls, would mean Mboweni has less wiggle room to support Eskom, which asked for ZAR 100bln in government support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, Commerzbank sees a risk that the government will not be able to set-aside enough cash to support the utility company, hence &ldquo;the downside trend of the rand that started at the beginning of this month is likely to continue.&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tax</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regard to tax hikes, the former Finance Minister stated that VAT would be increased from 14% to 15% which would mark the first increase in two decades. Although, economists at Momentum Investments note that a VAT hike will be difficult in the current economic environment, Bloomberg News analyst expect Mboweni to announce a tax increase in one form or another, especially in light of the expected tax collection shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other factors to watch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public sector wage bill - As the SA government seeks cost savings, some have proposed that the state may announce measures to roll back its public sector wage bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growth incentives - In light of the aforementioned below-par economic growth, the Finance Minister will have to lay out a plan for boosting growth. World Bank projections show the country&rsquo;s economy will be among the worst performers in the region this year, expanding only by around 1.3%, well below the forecast 4.2% growth rate of its EM peers. SocGen recommends buying dips in USD/ZAR as the budget is released.</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds remain relatively well bid/underpinned on pull-backs, while eyeing BTP moves and EU stocks ahead of FOMC minutes that are closely followed by the ECB&rsquo;s full account of January&rsquo;s policy meeting tomorrow, which are both expected to underscore recent tweaks to more dovish guidance. Looking at Eurex price action in more detail, the core bond opened at 166.45 and then meandered between 166.35-55 against yesterday&rsquo;s 166.42 close before nudging to a fresh high of 166.59 in more recent trade as Italian bonds retreat a bit further amidst comments from ECB&rsquo;s Praet playing down prospects of another TLTRO as soon as the next policy convene in March.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) were mixed with Australia dragged lower by continued underperformance in Consumer Staples after Woolworth shares slumped more than 5% post-earnings, while Tokyo stocks were propped up as the impact of a weaker currency eclipsed the concerns from the steepest decline in Japanese Exports for more than 2 years. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were also varied as the mainland lagged despite the PBoC announcement of its first liquidity injection since before the Lunar New Year, as the amount was a relatively paltry CNY 20bln and with participants also kept tentative ahead of upcoming senior level trade discussions between US and China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with price action contained by an indecisive risk tone in the region and after having recently hit resistance at 153.00, while the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributed to the lacklustre trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-day reverse repos.

In separate reports, the US is said to be pushing for a stable yuan and is wielding the tariff threat if this is violated.

In related news, a spokesperson said PM May and Brexit Ministers updated cabinet on Brexit and that the UK is still looking to reopen the withdrawal agreement. (Telegraph/Guardian/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would be mutual calamity for UK and EU, while he also noted that the most urgent task is to reach an agreement that will protect trading relationship with EU. Furthermore, Hammond said the Malthouse initiative is a valuable effort to allay backstop concerns in the future but added that EU will not consider a replacement to the backstop now. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Barclay was said to have confirmed new legal proposals prepared by Attorney General Cox will be taken to the EU on Wednesday and that the Malthouse Compromise alternative arrangements will be a part of future relationship discussions, while Barclay also stressed the need to avoid a no-deal Brexit and is confident that new proposals will lead to progress, according to Sky Political Correspondent Kate McCann. However, McCann later tweeted that UK&#39;s new legal proposals may not be presented to the EU on Wednesday and could instead be on Thursday or Friday. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Brexit Negotiator Barnier said there is a &quot;clear and strong&quot; unity of EU27 leaders to preserve the Withdrawal Agreement in &quot;all its dimensions, including on Ireland&quot;, while there were comments from EU Commission President Juncker that he expects &quot;friendly&quot; talks with UK PM May today and that no EU member will oppose a UK request for an extension. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutch MPs warned EU to prepare for the worst regarding Brexit as they were left with the impression UK politics is &quot;locked in the mother of all chicken games&quot; and &quot;a mess&quot; following a visit to Westminster.

Elsewhere, JPY weakened in the aftermath of disappointing trade data in which Japanese Exports declined by the most since October 2016, while AUD/USD eventually shrugged off early pressure from softer than expected Wage Prices amid a subdued greenback and as the PBoC also strengthened its reference rate accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Wage Price Index (Q4) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%).

Elsewhere, gold prices took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s advances which was on the back of the recent USD-woes, while copper was also steady amid the cautiously optimistic risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keystone oil pipeline has restarted with 20% pressure reduction, according to US regulator PHMSA. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no pressing time schedule for the denuclearisation of North Korea provided that no nuclear testing is carried out, while the US State Department said sanctions on North Korea to be maintained until US has achieved the final result of full verified denuclearisation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China officially warned citizens on travel to New Zealand in which it said to expect robberies, dangerous driving and a police force with a patchy response record. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were down by 0.5-2.4bps across the curve, with steepening in the belly being seen ahead of the FOMC minutes, which are expected to continue the dovish rhetoric seen out of the central bank in 2019. The complex settled off highs, which newswires attributed to talks between the US and China nearing their deadline (on 1 March). US T-note futures (H9) settled 5+ ticks higher at 122-07.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The press lockup for the FOMC minutes has been cancelled as the Fed announced Washington offices will be closed today due to weather, although the minutes will still be released as scheduled at 1400EST. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Hawk) said would need a different outlook for inflation or growth to back further rate hikes and that monetary policy is where it should be with rates around neutral, while he added that current data is a strong argument for taking some time on rates. Furthermore, Williams sees balance sheet reserves falling to USD 1trln &#39;or somewhat more&#39; vs around USD 1.6trln now and expects to be drawing down balance sheet for some time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Non-Voter, Hawk) said she would be comfortable ending balance sheet runoff before year end and doesn&#39;t think it would have a material effect on the economy, while she also thinks a rate increase could be needed later this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney said President Trump is working on drug pricing, trade and deregulation and is also spending a lot of time preparing for his North Korean summit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Economic Advisor Hassett sees another 3%+ growth in 2019 and doesn&#39;t see a recession this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded somewhat indecisive following the cautious gains seen on Wall St. ahead of this week&rsquo;s key events including FOMC minutes and US-China trade talks. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) were mixed with Australia dragged lower by continued underperformance in Consumer Staples after Woolworth shares slumped more than 5% post-earnings in which it met expectations but saw a more subdued consumer environment for the foreseeable future, while Tokyo stocks were propped up as the impact of a weaker currency eclipsed the concerns from the steepest decline in Japanese Exports for more than 2 years. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were also varied as the mainland lagged despite the PBoC announcement of its first liquidity injection since before the Lunar New Year, as the amount was a relatively paltry CNY 20bln and with participants also kept tentative ahead of upcoming senior level trade discussions between US and China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with price action contained by an indecisive risk tone in the region and after having recently hit resistance at 153.00, while the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributed to the lacklustre trade.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) are mixed with Australia dragged lower by continued underperformance in Consumer Staples after Woolworth shares slumped around 5% post earnings in which it met expectations but saw a more subdued consumer environment for the foreseeable future, while Tokyo stocks are firm as the impact of a weaker currency eclipsed the concerns from the steepest decline in Japanese Exports for more than 2 years. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are higher but with the mainland lagging despite the PBoC announcement of its first liquidity injection since before the Lunar New Year, as the amount was a relatively paltry CNY 20bln and with participants also kept tentative ahead of upcoming senior level trade discussions between US and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY languishes after the prior day&rsquo;s slide from the 97.00 level and amid cautiousness heading into today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes, while its major counterparts eke further gains overnight with EUR/USD and GBP/USD trading with a firm grip on the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles respectively. Elsewhere, JPY weakened in the aftermath of disappointing trade data in which Japanese Exports declined by the most since October 2016, while AUD/USD eventually shrugged off early pressure from softer than expected Wage Prices amid a subdued greenback and as the PBoC also strengthened its reference rate accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price action contained by an indecisive risk tone in the region and after having recently hit resistance at 153.00, while the absence of the BoJ in the market also contributes to the uneventful trade.</p>\r\n",
