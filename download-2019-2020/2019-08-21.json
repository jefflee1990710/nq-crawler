Tesla (TSLA) was lower after reports it is being sued by Walmart (WMT) over allegedly failing to live up to industry standards in its installation of solar panels on top of hundreds of stores, which resulted in multiple fires across the US. Toll Brothers (TOL) fell despite earnings beat, with disappointing decline in unit orders.

In wake of the minutes, there was more modest flattening; the minutes themselves were mostly as expected, although it did make a reference to the 3-month/10-year part of the curve (policymakers concerned over the persistent inversion). Interestingly, the \"mid-cycle adjustment\" comment made its way into the minutes, suggesting it was not an off-the-cuff remark by Chair Powell at the July presser. The 2s10s part of the curve narrowed modestly in wake of the minutes, but at settlement, had just about avoided entering inversion again. Attention now shifts to Thursday's ECB minutes, survey data, and the start of the Jackson Hole conference, all ahead of the weekend's G7 meeting; traders will be looking to policymakers for clues about both monetary and fiscal policy easing (and any indication of a quasi-coordinated effort). US T-note futures (U9) settle 6+ ticks lower at 130-17.</p>",

Nonetheless, markets reversed from yesterday’s risk off tone amid no real catalyst, however some desks note Tuesday’s sell-off was driven by a lack of volume in the European market. Positive earnings from retailers Target (TGT) &amp; Lowe’s (LOW) also added to positive sentiment at the open, showing even further signs consumers are still active after Walmart’s (WMT) stellar earnings report last week. Gains were capped post FOMC as the 2s10s curve briefly inverted once again. Now that the backward-looking FOMC minutes have been dispatched with, the market’s focus is on comments due from Fed Chair Powell on Friday, though Thursday’s ECB minutes and PMI data should contribute to the global growth theme. And after Powell, on the weekend’s G7 summit. And in wake of those events, traders will take stock of how global monetary and fiscal authorities will support growth, in perhaps a quasi-coordinated fashion. This week, desks have warned of risks of disappointment from these events, so the reaction in the early part of next week will be key in determining the tone of how risk assets will trade in the weeks’ ahead.</p><p><strong>* FOMC MINUTES: </strong>Minutes for the July FOMC stated that a couple of policymakers would have preferred a 50bps rate cut instead of 25bps in order to address low inflation. Most saw a 25bps rate cut as part of a \"recalibration\" of its policy stance, or a mid-cycle adjustment, in response to the recent outlook changes. Of those who favoured a rate cut, they noted a decelerating economy, elevated risks on the global economy, trade risks, and the outlook for US inflation. Several favoured holding rates. Interestingly, the minutes revealed that policymakers pursued a policy approach that avoids giving the impression that the central bank is on a pre-set course. The key from the minutes, traders said, was that the phrase mid-cycle adjustment made an appearance in the release; that suggests that Fed Chair Powell's use of the phrase was not an off-the-cuff remark at the post-meeting press conference. As such, traders said this would likely continue putting pressure on the 2s10s part of the curve, into inversion once again. In wake of the minutes, Fed funds futures see a 98% chance of a 25bps cut (vs 93% before the meeting); for the September meeting specifically, money markets price around 27bps of easing at the September meeting (a 25bps rate cut remains fully priced) versus around 30bps at the end of last week; markets price 110bps of easing through the end of 2020 (unch vs end of last week).</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> San Francisco Fed President Daly late Tuesday penned a post where she said incoming economic data points to continued economic expansion, citing solid labour markets and consumer spending. Daly explained that her vote to cut rates in July was to counter economic headwinds, but not because she feared an imminent recession. She warned however, that a recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy if headwinds from weaker global growth and trade uncertainties continue to linger. Fed’s Kashkari (non-voter, Dove) wrote an op-ed in the FT, pushing the argument that the Fed should implement forward guidance. Kashkari said the Fed should use forward guidance now, and that it can also provide stimulus by signalling that overnight rates will be low in the future. Kashkari made the point that it was better to use forward guidance now, before rates hit the lower bound, since if a central bank cuts rates to zero in response to a downturn and then announces that it plans to keep rates low, that can actually be perceived as a sign of weakness rather than strength. Kashkari said that, at minimum, the Fed should commit to not hiking again until core inflation reaches 2% on a sustainable basis. Elsewhere, Kashkari said he'd argue for rate cuts at the September FOMC.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP:</strong> US President Trump largely reiterated remarks he has made recently; once again, he attacked the Fed, intimating that the central bank was holding back the economy. On the payrolls tax, he said he was not looking at cutting this tax right now, because the economy is strong, and does not need one. Analysts have suggested that Trump has shown signs of relenting recently. Recent instances of a potential Trump relent include: 1) a conference call between Trump and bank chiefs last week regarding the stock market on Wednesday, 2) Friday's Treasury announcement that it was mulling additional ultra-long issuance, and 3) this week's news that a payroll tax cut is being considered by the administration. UBS says that \"while one can't be certain all of these came directly from Trump himself, it would certainly seem consistent with a Trump that is becoming increasingly anxious about the potential for an economic slowdown right ahead of elections.\" However, on the China front, UBS says that Trump is being politically rewarded for being hawkish, and therefore, we should not expect a capitulation on trade, with UBS arguing that he will instead rely on other levers first. Payroll tax cuts, however, do not seem likely to be one of those levers, UBS says, since they fund social security and Medicare, and the Democrats in the House would therefore likely oppose. But UBS says we should keep an eye out for other propositions in the coming weeks and months. \"Ultimately the signs are increasing that the Trump put strike is approaching at-the-money,\" UBS says, \"it may then follow then that the Fed may feel even less pressure to meet market expectations for a more aggressive path of rate cuts.\"</p><p><strong>* 2019 CES PRELIMINARY BENCHMARK REVISION</strong>: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced its preliminary estimate of the upcoming annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey employment series; the update means that the US created 501k fewer jobs in the last year than was previously reported. The final benchmark revision will be issued in February 2020, with the publication of the January 2020 Employment Situation news release.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES</strong>: The July print rose from the prior revised 5.29mln to 5.42mln, beating expectations of 5.39mln. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the rise was not as large as implied by the June pending sales index, which pointed to a 5.55mln reading, although it is a step in the right direction, and points to a rise in sales in the early part of autumn. The inventory stood at 4.2months worth which equates to 1.89mln units; Pantheon said the inventories were stabilising and expect price gains to firm over the next few months too.</p><p><strong>* CANADA CPI</strong>: Consumer prices rose to 2.0% Y/Y, above expectations for a deceleration to 1.7% from 2.0%; the M/M measure rose by 0.5% (prev. -0.2%), also beating expectations for 0.2%. Analysts at RBC noted that the increase in inflation is down to a surge in July airfares increasing 14% M/M, however, energy still accounted for a large portion of the gains, as energy prices rose 1.9% M/M following the prior months' decline. The three BoC measures averaged 2.03%, unchanged from the prior month and in line with BoC’s inflation target. RBC mentions that the odds of BoC entering an easing cycle like the Fed and other global central banks has recently intensified, with risks tilted to an earlier move than the 25bps cut in early 2020 which is pencilled in. RBC highlights this report did little to change the narrative that near-term price and economic growth trends still look too strong for the BoC to justify a rate cut immediately. Prior to the release markets were pricing in 26bps worth of easing by December, however following today’s inflation readings pricing has lowered to just shy of 25bp priced in by December, and 33.78bp by January 2020.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Ahead of the meeting tomorrow between French President Macron and UK PM Johnson, a French official said that, in view of UK PM Johnson's position on the Irish backstop, the baseline scenario now seems to be a no-deal Brexit; even in the case of a no-deal, the EU will consider Brexit bill to be due. EU would probably accept to grant UK a delay on Brexit to hold new election, the official said, but added that the UK should have no doubt France, Germany and other EU countries are totally united, and that the EU will not cave it to pressure from US President Trump. Macron stated he can’t see a reason to grant a Brexit delay if there is no big change in the political situation, such as an election or referendum. He added, the renegotiation of Brexit deal on Johnson’s terms is not workable and that the US could not offset the cost of a no deal for Britain. UK PM Johnson’s meeting with German Chancellor Merkel has not yielded any meaningful Brexit breakthrough (at pixel time), despite some constructive remarks from Merkel on Tuesday (she called for practical solutions to be found on the backstop issue; though she did suggest that this should be in the framework of the political declaration, not the withdrawal agreement). In the press conference, she also mentioned she sees “possibilities” for a solution to the Irish backstop, but it would require hard work adding maybe we can find a solution in “maybe the next two years, maybe we can find it in the next 30 days”. Merkel and Johnson tended to reiterate familiar arguments at the press conference. Given the Johnson administration has already imposed a ‘red line’ (backstop must be jettisoned from the withdrawal agreement, or the UK/EU cannot reach a Brexit deal), the dial is once again little changed. Johnson will meet French President Macron on Thursday, ahead of his attendance at this weekend’s G7 meeting, and that meeting is probably worth paying more attention to, SocGen says, noting that President Macron has been the flag bearer with EU Council President Tusk for opposing new negotiations, and standing by 31st October as the firm and final deadline. Expectations for that Johnson/Macron meeting are low. Elsewhere, in domestic Brexit preparations, the UK Treasury announced it will automatically enrol 88k UK exporting companies in a key customs-tracking system, allowing trade with the EU to continue after 31st October, the date where the UK is scheduled to officially leave the EU.</p><p><strong>* TAIWAN: </strong>China has threatened sanctions over the deal for the US to sell F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan, in an USD 8bln deal for 66 jets. Beijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory, and has regularly criticised US/Taiwan arms deals. China said it will take all necessary measures to safeguard its own interests.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iranian President Rouhani said if Iran’s oil exports are brought down to zero, international waterways will not have the same security as before; reiterating that Iran has reduced commitments in the nuclear deal and will not accept others not delivering on theirs. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif (a noted “dove” of the Iranian regime) said on Wednesday that he had held productive meetings with Scandinavian officials – including Sweden’s PM - on issues of mutual interest and on ways to meaningfully preserve the 2015 nuclear pact; earlier saying Iran would revert to the pact if Europe makes its commitments, even if the US does not. French President Macron later said he will hold talks with Iranian officials ahead of the G7 to make proposals, adding that he previously proposed some sanction relief or a compensation mechanism, but in return Iran must fully commit to the nuclear pact and broader negotiations on other issues. It was also reported on Wednesday that another US drone was shot down in the region on Tuesday - in Yemen - by the Houthi rebels, a group known to be backed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</p><p><strong>* TREASURIES: US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-17.</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve flattened on Wednesday; major curve spreads were mixed/little changed in the early part of the session, as traders awaited the FOMC's July meeting minutes. In wake of the minutes, there was more modest flattening; the minutes themselves were mostly as expected, although it did make a reference to the 3-month/10-year part of the curve (policymakers concerned over the persistent inversion). Interestingly, the \"mid-cycle adjustment\" comment made its way into the minutes, suggesting it was not an off-the-cuff remark by Chair Powell at the July presser. The 2s10s part of the curve narrowed modestly in wake of the minutes, but at settlement, had just about avoided entering inversion again. Attention now shifts to Thursday's ECB minutes, survey data, and the start of the Jackson Hole conference, all ahead of the weekend's G7 meeting; traders will be looking to policymakers for clues about both monetary and fiscal policy easing (and any indication of a quasi-coordinated effort)</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 0.45 LOWER AT USD 55.68; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 0.27 HIGHER AT USD 60.30.</strong></p><p>Crude prices are lower on the day after a net bearish EIA report saw benchmarks decouple from the improved risk appetite. EIA reported crude stocks drawing 2.7mln bbls (less than the API reported -3.5mln, but larger than the expected -1.9mln), however the products were more bearish (distillates +2.6mln vs. exp. +0.3mln; gasoline +0.3mln vs. exp. +0.17mln), which saw a net build (crude + products) of 190k, and benchmarks consequentially headed lower through to settlement. Elsewhere in the EIA report, production remained unchanged at 12.3mln BPD; Cushing reported another large draw (-2.5mln bbls) amid the de-bottlenecking of supply out of the Permian Basin; refinery utilisation remained elevated (1.1% vs. exp. 0.1%) which will have been a factor in rising product stocks. Elsewhere, Canadian Trans Mountain announced it had re-started construction on the Trans Mountain expansion project, which will bring capacity to 890k BPD from 300k once complete.</p><p><strong>*ITALY:</strong> After PM Conte resigned on Tuesday, the question of whether we will get an alternative Italian government, or whether Italians will go to the polls (October/November has been suggested as the ‘window’) remains unresolved. A coalition between PD and 5SM could be given a mandate to attempt to form a government in order to push through the Italian budget in the autumn, but desks are not ruling out the more market-unfriendly snap elections, where polling data highlights the possibility that populist Salvini’s Lega could win a majority.</p><p><strong>*GEOPOLITICS:</strong> China has threatened sanctions over the deal for the US to sell F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan, in an USD 8bln deal for 66 jets. Beijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory, and has regularly criticised US/Taiwan arms deals. China said it will take all necessary measures to safeguard its own interests.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 0.8% AT 2924, NASDAQ-100 0.9% AT 7733, DOW JONES 0.9% AT 26204.</strong></p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 1.8%, Consumer Staples 0.3%, Energy 0.8%, Financials 0.5%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 0.7%, Information Technology 1.2%, Materials 0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 0.7%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW) reported solid earnings, both beating on top and bottom line; TGT raised FY EPS guidance and forecast SSS to increase 3.4% for FY19. LOW reported SSS +2.3% and affirmed its FY19 EPS guidance. The decent earnings boosted other retailers, with Kohl’s (KSS), Gap (GAP) and Nordstrom (JWN) among the outperformers in the SPX. On the flipside, Aflac (ALF) was an underperformer on reports it mis-sold insurance policies in Japan. Tesla (TSLA) was lower after reports it is being sued by Walmart (WMT) over allegedly failing to live up to industry standards in its installation of solar panels on top of hundreds of stores, which resulted in multiple fires across the US. Toll Brothers (TOL) fell despite earnings beat, with disappointing decline in unit orders. Alliance Data Systems (ADS) was higher after it announced its final results of its modified Dutch auction tender offer; roughly 12,100,000 shares of common stock were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below the purchase price of USD 162.00 per share.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>DX</strong> pared mild losses post-FOMC minutes ahead of the Jackson Hole Symposium. <strong>CAD</strong> outperformed following firm CPI data however USDCAD pared back some of its gains as oil prices continued to slide post DOE inventories. <strong>EURUSD</strong> traded rangebound all day as EUR tracked the dollar ahead of key events and remained relatively resilient given ongoing Italian and Spanish politics. <strong>Havens (JPY, CHF)</strong> were lower on the day as risk sentiment took a turn from yesterday. <strong>EMFX:</strong> Amidst a general recovery mission vs the Buck, the Rand managed to overcome soft inflation data as it still remains within the SARB inflation band, and further justifies the recent rate cut. The CPI was also driven by softer transport prices which are not expected to repeat as petrol prices have been rising in August and also expected to in September. The Argentine Peso lagged again, and its Mexican rival was hampered by softer than forecast Mexican retail sales data and rather downbeat Banxico rhetoric, albeit still stronger against USD.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NOK/SEK/CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are (aptly) sitting at the head of the major table amidst a robust recovery in risk appetite that is also feeding into crude and fuelling gains in the Norwegian Krona and Canadian Dollar especially. Hence, Eur/Nok has pulled-back sharply from 10.0000 again, and closer to 9.9200, while Usd/Cad is testing bids said to be sitting just under Monday’s low at 1.3250 vs 1.3251 after stronger than forecast Canadian inflation data that has trimmed the probability of a BoC cut for September to sub-20% from a whisker above 25% pre-release, accordingly and naturally. Similarly, the Aussie has crept closer to 0.6800 again vs its US counterpart and touched 1.0600 on the Kiwi cross due to relative near term policy outlooks/guidance from the RBA compared to the Fed and RBNZ. Note, Nzd/Usd continues to hover precariously above 0.6400.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>More late drama for the Pound, but this time a bout of weakness prompted by French comments on Brexit that are broadly negative in contrast to Germany’s Merkel yesterday. In short, UK PM Johnson’s position on the Irish border backstop means that the base scenario now appears to be no deal, and even in that event the EU expects Britain to foot the bill for leaving. Cable retreated further from near 1.2200 in response, but is holding just above 1.2100 and the 10 DMA (1.2103) awaiting tonight’s dinner date between Johnson and Merkel, ahead of his meeting with France’s Macron on Thursday that looks set to be less cordial. Back to Sterling, Eur/Gbp has rebounded through 0.9150 and from a technical perspective could also test a DMA that resides up at 0.9208 and aligns with a Fib retracement level (vs the 30 DMA down at 0.9105).</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>Somewhat mixed fortunes for the non-US Dollar safe-havens as the Franc and Yen traded mostly weaker around 106.50 and 0.9800 respectively, but the single currency continued to pivot 1.1100 (like Gold on the Usd1500/oz axis) amidst the upturn in risk sentiment noted above. The Euro remains resilient (if not complacent) to potential heightened political upheaval on the Eurozone margins via Italy and Spain, or simply tracked muted moves in the Greenback pre-FOMC minutes as the <strong>DXY</strong> meandered rather aimlessly between 98.139-302.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Amidst a general recovery mission vs the Buck, the Rand managed to overcome soft and SARB rate cut inducive SA inflation data on the premise that sub-target CPI is good for the economy as a whole, but the Argentine Peso lagged again and its Mexican rival was hampered by softer than forecast Mexican retail sales data and rather downbeat Banxico rhetoric.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Recent instances of a potential Trump relent include: 1) a conference call between Trump and bank chiefs last week regarding the stock market on Wednesday, 2) Friday's Treasury announcement that it was mulling additional ultra-long issuance, and 3) this week's news that a payroll tax cut is being considered by the administration.</li><li>UBS says that \"while one can't be certain all of these came directly from Trump himself, it would be certainly seem consistent with a Trump that is becoming increasingly anxious about the potential for an economic slowdown right ahead of elections.\"</li><li>However, on the China front, UBS says that Trump is being politically rewarded for being hawkish, and therefore, we should not expect a capitulation on trade, with UBS arguing that he will instead rely on other levers first. Payroll tax cuts, however, do not seem likely to be one of those levers, UBS says, since they fund social security and Medicare, and the Democrats in the House would therefore likely oppose.</li><li>But UBS says we should keep an eye out for other propositions in the coming weeks and months. \"Ultimately the signs are increasing that the Trump put strike is approaching at-the-money,\" UBS says, \"it may then follow then that the Fed may feel even less pressure to meet market expectations for a more aggressive path of rate cuts.\"</li></ul>",

Or maybe the 10 year debt future has actually benefited from curve displacement and long end underperformance via curve re-positioning in wake of the 2050 launch? Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain weak and the curve steeper albeit off overnight extremes in outright and spread terms, largely shrugging off loud policy calls from Fed uber-dove Kashkari ahead of FOMC minutes and housing data.</p>",

The pricing function in equity markets needs to incorporate information other than macroeconomic indicators, which makes equity market sentiment inherently susceptible to divergence from actual economic conditions toward excessive optimism. <strong>\"If expectations for stimulus measures to boost economic momentum end in disappointment, the gap between equity sentiment and bond sentiment could narrow once again.\"</strong></li><li>The bank says that <strong>investors are on watch for a rise in bond volatility </strong>at present. \"However, this appears to be heavily based on buyers pushing up volatility in a flight to quality in the bond markets, a situation we ascribe to concerns about a global economic slowdown manifesting in an undercurrent of panic buying.\"</li><li>The bank says it is hearing a lot from clients about higher bond volatility leading to bond sell-offs by CTAs, risk-parity funds, and other systematic players; However, Nomura thinks this rationale is flawed. \"We think it likely that the strong performance of systematic players since the start of the year is owing to bond long positions for both CTAs and risk-parity funds. At the same time, market participants are likely raising their leverage on bond positions, such that any sudden sharp market swing would tend to occasion a surge in position risk.\"</li><li>But Nomura notes that risk-parity funds and CTAs have not turned net sellers of bonds to any large extent. \"First, risk-parity funds aim to maintain overall portfolio risk at a certain level.</li><li>The bank notes that risk parity funds allocate on a systematic basis, with the funds not only taking into account the absolute level of bond volatility, but also volaility across all asset classes. As a result, risk-parity funds will not necessarily rush to deleverage risk across their entire portfolios if stock prices and bond prices maintain their diametric relationship as typical in the past, and when equity and commodity volatility are also rising, as at present. Additionally, trend-following CTAs continue to add longs in bond futures of major sovereign bonds. \"Rising bond volatility is acting as a cap on CTAs' leverage, but with conspicuous upward momentum in futures for various sovereign bonds, we think CTAs are choosing to hold to a course of moderate net purchasing,\" Nomura says.</li></ul>",

President Mattarella will now begin talks with Parliamentary groups in search of a new coalition</strong>. If a new coalition is not formed, Italy could see the appointment a technocratic government with the goal of passing the Autumn 2020 budget in order to avoid an automatic 3% VAT tax hike. Failing that, the President will have to dissolve Parliament three and a half years ahead of schedule to pave the way for a general election in October or November.</p><p><strong>*CARETAKER GOVERNMENT: </strong>President Mattarella has already approached Conte to remain as caretaker PM. Citi sees two possible governments of scope:</p><ul><li>Technocratic Government – A group with a set goal to pass the Autumn 2020 budget to avoid a tax hike.</li><li>5SM-led Government – Supported by PD and other MPs. This scenario seems less likely given the political difference between the 5SM and PD. Citi adds that such a coalition will not bode well with voters.</li></ul><p><strong>*ELECTIONS</strong>: League Leader Salvini said he will not resign and will remain as Interior Minister, while he will ask President Mattarella for early elections and stated there is no plan B besides an early vote. <strong>The timing of an election is subject to the Parliamentary reform </strong>which aims for a reduction in MPs (see schedule below), which HSBC says would mean elections could not take place for another five to six months at least, due to the need to allow a possible referendum to be called, and to re-draw the electoral boundaries. Analysts at ING believe that an election remain the most likely option: “The possibility of new elections and the threat of an extended period of political uncertainty continues to hint at downside risks for the Euro, alongside the possible dampening effect of the ECB's easing package to be delivered in September”, it said.</p><p><strong>*LATEST POLLING:</strong> Comparing the 2018 general election results to current polls: League currently leads polls at 37% (it currently has 17.4% of the seats in the Lower House), PD follows in the polls with 23% (vs current 18.8%) and 5SM with 18% (vs current 32.7%). In terms of the smaller parties, Brothers of Italy poll at 7% (vs 4.4% in Parliament) and Forza Italia is polling at 6% (vs. current 14%)</p><p><strong>*SCHEDULE:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>21st AUG</strong> - The President will begin <strong>consultation with minor groups at 1500 BST/1000 ET</strong>.</li><li><strong>22nd AUG</strong> - Mattarella is expected to <strong>hold talks with the main parties</strong>, concluding with the 5SM at <strong>1600 BST/1100 ET</strong>. Tomorrow will also see the Lower House’ vote on the Fraccaro law, i.e. the proposal to see the number of MPs in both houses cut from 945 to 600. The <strong>approval of the law will prevent Italy from having elections until at least June 2020</strong>, Citi says.

However, supply may also be a factor today given the new 2050 Bund launch in Eur2 bn and with little else on the agenda until the after hours FOMC minutes that kick off a busy run in to the weekend.</p>",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) underperforms with broad losses seen across its sectors and with heavy losses seen in Iluka Resources, Stockland and WorleyParsons post-earnings, although APA Group and Seven Group Holdings are at the other end of the spectrum due to better FY results. Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is also lower but off worse levels as exporters find some solace from a gradually weakening currency, while Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are indecisive after the PBoC’s quasi liquidity efforts resulted to another net daily drain and amid ongoing trade uncertainty as US President reiterated he is currently not ready to make a trade deal with China but also suggested something will happen maybe sooner or maybe later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, DXY is lacklustre after the prior day’s losses although remains above the 98.00 level with downside limited as participants await the latest clues from the Fed beginning with today’s FOMC minutes and Fed Chair Powell’s remarks on Friday. In addition, a non-committal tone is also seen in the greenback’s major counterparts with EUR/USD contained just below the 1.1100 handle amid political uncertainty in the bloc’s periphery in which Italy PM Conte submitted his resignation following the breakdown of the ruling coalition and after acting Spanish PM Sanchez failed in his first attempt to form a new government amid differences between his Socialists and the Podemos party. GBP/USD is quiet as it holds on to the recent gains spurred by comments from German Chancellor Merkel regarding practical solutions to the backstop and reports that some in the EU are said to have hinted at concessions on the backstop in back channels, although the upward momentum has dissipated as Merkel noted her comments concerned the political declaration on future ties not the withdrawal agreement and as sides continue to point the finger of blame at each other. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses rebound on a resumption of this week’s price swings, while antipodeans are choppy as support following a firmer than expected PBoC reference rate setting is counterbalanced by their high beta properties.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with initial upside from the cautious risk tone later faded after hitting resistance at the 155.00 level and near its record highs, with the BoJ only in the market today for Treasury Discount Bills.</p>",
