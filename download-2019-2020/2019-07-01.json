To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US MARKET WRAP 1st July 2019: Traders fade G20 optimism</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong> Equites up, Treasuries down, dollar up, crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>Favourable G20 outcome sees risk assets rally; OPEC+ to extend supply curb pact; mixed manufacturing ISM.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> Data: German Retail Sales, UK Construction PMI, Canadian Manufacturing PMI. Event: RBA Rate Decision, OPEC+ Meeting. Speakers: RBA’s Lowe, Fed’s Williams &amp; Mester, BoE’s Carney. Auctions: Japanese JPY 2.1trl 2029, UK GBP 3bln 0.625% 2025.</p><p><strong>* MARKETS: </strong>It appears as though traders have ‘sold the fact’ of both the G20, as well as the OPEC+ supply curb extension. Stocks gapped higher at the open, shortly printing fresh intraday record highs, though have been gradually grinding lower since. Similarly, the crude complex rallied early doors on the G20 outcome, and as OPEC and its partners reportedly agree to a nine month supply cut extension, though prices plateaued in the US pre-market, before falling to settle slightly higher, but well off-highs. The Treasury curve shape was largely unchanged, however, yields rose across the curve, slightly bear-flattening. The USD reigned supreme, which made it tough for other FX to make any headway, while havens saw outflows after one major market hurdle is now out of the way. Attention now moves on to the OPEC+ meeting on Tuesday, and jobs data at the end of the week, bookending the US Independence Day Holiday on Thursday.</p><p><strong>* G20: </strong>Risk was on after the US and China on the weekend agreed to resume trade talks and suspend any further tariff hikes (existing tariff settings remain unchanged for now), as had been expected. However, a gulf remains between the two sides; Chinese press played down the prospects of a full trade deal, stressing that the 10% of the deal remaining to be negotiated still carried substantial differences (this includes issues around IP theft). Additionally, specifics of the meeting are still unclear, however, President Trump did state that US companies would be able to sell their equipment with no national security issues to Huawei. However, some have suggested that the lack of detail is still keeping some traders cautious, particularly since the relationship is still fragile, a deal is far from being reached, and as seen in the past, until the dotted line has been signed, the prospect of a breakdown in talks always remains.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLED USD 0.62 HIGHER AT USD 59.09; BRENT (U9) SETTLED USD 0.32 HIGHER AT USD 65.06: </strong>Oil traded on the front-foot earlier in the session after Russia said it would support an extension of the supply curb agreement at current levels for 6- to 9-months at current levels (Iran seems to have an issue with when the agreement with OPEC+ comes into effect, reportedly), with the G20 outcome also supporting the demand-side of the equation, however prices reversed course heading into settlement, with a sell off in equity markets and a stronger dollar not providing any favours. The door is now open for OPEC to rubber stamp the agreement on Tuesday (monitoring committee favours a 9-month extension). While this emboldens the view of oil bulls, some desks have warned that the crude complex could be subject to some profit-taking, which seems to have been playing out in the US afternoon. Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih said he believes compliance will be better in H2, and that oil demand is increasing but it is not necessarily looking firm for 2020, but added that he sees a large amount of the supply overhang drawing down at the same time. Looking ahead to the API and EIA US energy inventory reports for the most recent week, current expectations see draws across the board, with crude -2.5mln bbls, distillates -1.2mln bbls, and gasoline -2.2mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING ISM:</strong> fell to 51.7 in June from 52.1 in May but did beat the expected 51.0, a decent headline, especially when taken in the context of weak Fed regional surveys in June. However, the other components were more ominous with the prices component falling into contraction at 47.9, significantly missing the expected 53.0. Construction spending also disappointed at -0.8% month-on-month. Although production and employment rose, new orders dropped to the lowest since December 2015, and sits on the neutral line. “We hope for a modest rebound over the next months, though, assuming progress is made on the China trade negotiations and the fitful recovery in China’s business cycle gathers a bit of momentum,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “in the meantime, manufacturing is soft, but it’s not soft enough to make a big difference to the overall pace of economic growth.”</p><p><strong>* MANUFACTURING PMI SURVEYS: </strong>The official China manufacturing PMI remained at 49.4. Sub-indexes suggest weaker growth momentum in the manufacturing sector, though lower price inflation might have added downward bias, Goldman Sachs said. The Eurozone manufacturing PMI was revised lower, slightly missing consensus; new orders fell for the ninth straight month. UK manufacturing PMI sees back-to-back sub-50 readings for the UK manufacturing PMI since 2013, as the effect from continued Brexit-related stockpiling unwinds, while the fall in new orders does nothing to mitigate the headline.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Iran's enriched uranium stockpile has surpassed the 300kg limit, according to the IAEA, which puts the country in violation of the 2015 Nuclear Pact. This comes after the efforts made at the end of last week for the remaining signatories of the nuclear deal to reach an agreement, where although a new trade vehicle with the Europeans was established that could technically facilitate trade with Iran, whilst averting US sanctions, an Iranian official said that this was probably not enough for Iran to not break some of the pact’s components, as the EU would have to actually use the vehicle to trade (something that the US said would result in sanctions if used).</p><p><strong>* RBA PREVIEW: </strong>RBA will announce its latest rate decision on Tuesday morning, where the central bank is expected to lower its Cash Rate Target for a second straight meeting; ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures signal a 70% probability of a 25bps rate cut to a fresh record low of 1.00%, although this has fallen from highs around 89% last week, while the implied yield curve suggests rates could decline even further to 0.75% as early as November. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22192/download\">Click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Now that the G20 risk has passed, desks will be looking to Fed speak to see how much scope remains for an emergency rate cut, potentially at the July meeting. How much of that we get ahead of this week’s payrolls report remains to be seen, with the Fed in data-dependant mode. There was nothing new in remarks from Fed Vice Chair Clarida; some desks had hoped he would be more decisive on where he stood on a 50bps July rate cut, after uber dove Bullard last week pushed back on the notion.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> Mersch on the weekend repeated his warning that downside risks to growth remain and toed the ECB’s line in pledging to keep rates steady through Summer of 2020. Rehn, who is in the frame for the ECB President role when Draghi steps down, said he’d be willing to tweak all tools as necessary. ECB's chief economist Lane said the central bank must pay attention to market-based inflation expectations, adding that the anchoring of inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. ECB’s Knot acknowledged that expectations for Q2 and Q3 are less favourable than Q1, toeing the line that the bank is ready to act in adverse scenarios.</p><p><strong>* BOJ TANKAN: </strong>Overnight, the large manufacturers Tankan index fell to 7 in Q2 from 12 in Q1 (consensus 9); the outlook component fell to 7 from 8.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.8% AT 2964, NASDAQ-100 1.3% AT 7768, DOW JONES 0.4% AT 26717. SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; 1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; 1.5%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; 0.7%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; -0.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCKS:</strong> Semiconductors soared on the open after Trump eased some of the restrictions on China’s Huawei. Gaming names such as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) outperformed on strong Macau region casino revenue. Apple (AAPL) was an upward force on indices due to the G20 outcome being favourable for its China operations. Genesee &amp; Wyoming (GWR) jumped after Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) agreed to buyout the railroad co. for USD 8.4bln. Boeing (BA) underperformed amid fresh subpoenas from the DoJ over its production of the 787 Dreamliner. Coty (COTY) nosedived after announcing restructuring plans that wold include a USD 3bln write down. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) gave a profit warning for its next earnings release, seeing the share price tumble. L3Harris Technologies (LHX), the L3 plus Harris merger, spent its first day of trade in the red.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (U9) FUTURES SETTLE 9 TICKS LOWER AT 127-22: </strong>Overnight, weak China PMIs did not see a move into Treasuries, with markets largely focussing on the favourable outcome of the G20 talks. However, support for FI in early European trade came from a weak Eurozone PMI, which strengthened the Bund (and the T-Note in sympathy). But as the US got to their desks, the complex was sold, though there was brief buying after a mixed ISM report. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, but not changing by more than 1bps.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> was king, and the bid in havens unwound after the outcome of the G20, with <strong>JPY, CHF</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> seeing outflows; JPY capped by 108.50, XAU sub-USD 1400. <strong>EUR</strong> saw downside, accordingly, falling below its 200dma (@ 1.1342) in early trade after Bund/Treasury rate differentials moved in favour of the buck, and EUR stayed sub-200dma after the weak PMI report. <strong>GBP</strong> was a function of USD strength for the most part, though the manufacturing PMI highlights the challenges the economy is facing, and additionally, the Speaker of the House Bercow has not selected the Grieve/Beckett amendment (that would have tried to curb the government’s spending powers in the event of a no-deal exit), which would have attempted to avoid a no-deal scenario. <strong>AUD</strong> is among the worst performers in G10 FX, and some desks have suggested that the weak China PMI has enhanced the prospects that the RBA will cut rates by 25bps at its meeting overnight, although others have said that back-to-back cuts may give the impression of panic; additionally, Governor Lowe pushed back on the efficacy of the rate channel at a time when many cbanks are in dovish mode. The <strong>TRY</strong> rallied as the US suggested it would not slap sanctions on Turkey after its purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system. After two decades of negotiations, EU and South American Mercosur nations (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay) agreed to a trade deal at the end of last week, which will see tariffs between the two blocs substantially cut; <strong>BRL</strong> is higher, and traders will be looking to see a committee in the Lower House will vote on pension reform this week (keep an eye on the savings amount: the consensus appears to be around BRL 800bln of savings over a 10-year horizon). Meanwhile, the <strong>KRW</strong> (a great gauge of Asian risk sentiment) was lower against the USD overnight, not managing to garner much upside after the handshake between NK’s Kim and US President Trump.</p>",

The door is now open for OPEC to rubber stamp the agreement on Tuesday (monitoring committee favours a 9-month extension). While this emboldens the view of oil bulls, some desks have warned that the crude complex could be subject to some profit-taking, which seems to have been playing out in the US afternoon. Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih said he believes compliance will be better in H2, and that oil demand is increasing but it is not necessarily looking firm for 2020, but added that he sees a large amount of the supply overhang drawing down at the same time. Looking ahead to the API and EIA US energy inventory reports for the most recent week, current expectations see draws across the board, with crude -2.5mln bbls, distillates -1.2mln bbls, and gasoline -2.2mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback has regained composure after a bout of early pm selling pushed the <strong>DXY</strong> down to fresh session lows of 96.275, and an upward revision to Markit’s final June manufacturing PMI prompted the revival. However, the index failed to extend recovery gains on a headline ISM beat as some sub-components were weak, especially prices paid and new orders (former tumbling below 50 and latter only just holding. Nevertheless, the Buck remains bid vs all major counterparts following the weekend G20 meeting and agreement between US and Chinese Presidents Trump and Xi to resume trade talks, and the DXY is holding just shy of a 96.650 high.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The clear G20 laggard and underperformer due to multiple bearish factors, including sub-forecast Swiss data (retail sales), survey news (manufacturing PMI deeper below 50), a general post-G20 upturn in risk sentiment and a degree of first day investor jitters as Swiss equities began trading without EU recognition. Usd/Chf is hovering closer to circa 0.9850 highs and Eur/Chf extended to 1.1160 before easing back a few pips.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie is the next biggest major loser, and also in part due to weak manufacturing sector activity, but Chinese rather than Australian, as Aud/Usd slipped further below 0.7000 to sub-0.6980 and through 1.0450 vs the Kiwi that held up a bit better vs the Buck within a 0.6730-0.6685 range ahead of NZIER Q2 sentiment, capacity and building approvals later tonight. However, the big Antipodean event will be the RBA policy meeting overnight that is widely tipped to see another 25 bp ease on top of the ¼ point cut in June that will push the OCR to a fresh all time low of 1%, if confirmed – probability currently stands around 82% and a full preview has been posted on our Research Suite via the headline feed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound lost ground in wake of a bleak UK manufacturing PMI, as the headline contracted faster than expected and output lost grip of the 50 handle to post its worst reading since the start of Q3 2012. Cable hit lows of 1.2633 from 1.2707 at one stage after declining through a pseudo triple bottom between 1.2665-63 and a Fib at 1.2646, while Eur/Gbp spiked towards 0.8980 from 0.8925 at the low. Elsewhere, a disappointing Japanese Tankan hardly helped the Yen, but in truth the mostly firmer tone between 108.10-53 trading parameters was due to safe-haven unwinding on the perceived positive G20 developments, while the single currency saw choppy trade on disappointing Eurozone PMIs and technicals within a 1.13374-12 band, and after some due attention paid to decent option expiries in the 1.1320-35 zone (1.6 bn).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Norwegian Krona both benefited from a bounce in crude prices to an extent, as Usd/Cad remained tethered around 1.3100 and Eur/Nok straddled 9.6800 vs Eur/Sek that failed to sustain post-Swedish manufacturing PMI momentum down to 10.5260 at one stage.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Swedish Crown, Turkey’s Lira derived more support to compound a recovery of sorts in the manufacturing PMI from the absence of a specific reference to sanctions from US President Trump after his weekend get together with Erdogan, and Usd/Try fell through 5.6250 from 5.7910 in response. Similarly, the Real gleaned impetus from a better Brazilian manufacturing PMI to trade firmer vs the Dollar and Usd/Brl briefly dipped below 3.8100.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc has slumped across the board and only in part on a loss of safe-haven demand after the US-China trade truce forged on Saturday, as Swiss retail sales and manufacturing PMI both misses consensus by considerable margins, and the SMI kicks off H2 on its own after the EU severed links with the Swiss bourse. Usd/Chf is back up near 0.9850 and Eur/Chf has rebounded further above 1.1100 to just over 1.1150 vs recent lows of sub-1.1000 and circa 1.1055 respectively.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has also succumbed to all round selling in wake of the latest UK manufacturing PMI that was weaker than forecast and deeper in contraction territory, while output fell sharply from 50.3 to 47.2 and the worst level since October 2012. Cable recoiled from around 1.2707 at best through 1.2665-63 support that held several times in late June before breaching 1.2650 and a 1.2646 Fib on its way to a 1.2635 base, while Eur/Gbp has jumped towards 0.8970 from close to 0.8925 at one stage even though the single currency was pressured by disappointing Eurozone manufacturing PMIs as well.</p><p><strong>JPY/AUD/EUR</strong></p><p>The Yen has succumbed to the broad post-G20 recovery in risk sentiment, but not to the same extent as the Franc noted above, with 108.50 vs the Greenback tested and marginally topped before a relatively deep pull-back towards 108.25. A decent 1 bn option expiry may have capped the headline pair, while the <strong>DXY</strong> also faded after edging above 96.600 and a lack of follow-through buying to test near term resistance at 96.711 (June 21 peak). However, the Aussie remains on the backfoot just under 0.7000 ahead of Tuesday’s RBA policy meeting with a firm majority anticipating back-to-back 25 bp rate cuts, and the Euro is holding near the bottom of a hefty expiry zone from 1.1320 to 1.1335 (1.6 bn) having lost grip of the 200 DMA (a few pips below 1.1350) in the run up to the aforementioned poor PMIs and then breaching the 10 DMA (at 1.1328) to a 1.1315 low.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Kiwi are both down vs their US counterpart, but holding up better than most major rivals, bar the Scandi Crowns, with Usd/Cad only just above 1.3100 and Nzd/Usd hovering close to 0.6700. A firm rebound in oil prices is impacting, and also boosting the Nok (through 9.7000 vs the Eur), while the Kiwi is eyeing the impending NZIER Q2 survey for independent impetus. Note, Eur/Sek is back below 10.5500 in response to a rare manufacturing PMI beat from Sweden that will likely keep the Riksbank in hawkish mood on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira has extended gains made on the back of a relatively cordial meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and his US peer Trump on the G20 sidelines that assuaged concerns about sanctions over Russia’s imminent S-400 delivery with additional momentum coming in the form of a less contractionary manufacturing PMI. Usd/Try reversed from 5.7910 to 5.6735 in response before settling around 5.6950.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began H2 with gains across the board as global sentiment was buoyed following the US-China trade truce at the G20 in which the US agreed to not impose additional tariffs on China and with the sides to resume trade discussions, while President Trump also met with North Korea leader Kim at the Demilitarized Zone and became the first sitting US President to step into North Korean territory. ASX 200 (+0.5%) is lifted by the trade sensitive sectors, as well as energy names after oil prices were buoyed by news Russia and Saudi agreed to a 9-month extension of the output cut deal. Advances in Nikkei 225 (+1.8%) were exacerbated by favourable currency moves and the KOSPI (+0.1%) is also higher but with gains capped by tech weakness amid a dispute with Japan related to wartime force labour in which the latter is to restrict chip material exports to South Korea. Elsewhere, the Shanghai Comp. (+2.1%) is lifted due to the US-China trade truce and after President Trump commented that US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei, as long as the transactions won't present a great, national emergency problem. This has underpinned tech and telecom stocks with mainland China markets outperforming their regional peers despite the miss in Chinese Manufacturing PMI data and absence of Hong Kong participants for holiday.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer following the positive trade developments over the weekend and as its major counterparts trade mixed with EUR/USD subdued as it tests near-term support at 1.1350 where the 10DMA and 200DMA linger in close proximity, and with GBP/USD little changed as price action is stuck around the 1.2700 level. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was spurred by the US-China truce and reclaimed the 108.00 handle to the upside but has pulled back from intraday highs after running into resistance at 108.50, while antipodeans have failed to hold on to early gains with AUD/USD barely holding onto the 0.7000 handle after Chinese Official Manufacturing and Caixin Manufacturing PMI data both showed a contraction and amid wide expectations for another rate cut by the RBA in tomorrow’s meeting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they mirror the slump seen in T-notes and heavy losses across safe-havens, while the BoJ had announced its bond buying intentions last week in which it reduced its buying amounts of JGBs with 3yr-5yr and 10yr-25yr maturities.</p>",
