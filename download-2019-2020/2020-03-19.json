The selling pressures also abated in the government bond complex too, with the TPLEX bull steepening.

Event: China LPR (1 &amp; 5 year)</li></ul><h2>MARKET WRAP:</h2><p>Stocks made gains after recent sell-offs, meanwhile, the Dollar’s rally continued, with the DX rising above 102. Following a severe drop off on Wednesday, WTI posted its largest-ever percentage price gain, rebounding with risk appetite, for the time being, and also finding support from the US SPR moving forward with its purchasing plans, furthermore, Texas is reportedly gearing up to curtail production in what would be the first time in decades. The selling pressures also abated in the government bond complex too, with the TPLEX bull steepening. Aside from selling reprieve, desks noted the latest monetary stimulus measures, and anticipation of large fiscal measures, as supporting appetite for assets that aren’t just the US dollar: ECB announced EUR 750bln QE package; BoE cut its interest rate to effective lower bound and initiated fresh QE; Fed announces extended swap lines and new mutual fund backstop funding facility; RBA cut. Meanwhile, the US is soon to get confirmation on the latest stimulus package which is said to be more than USD 1.0trln, while UK Chancellor Sunak is set to announce even further measures on Friday. The stimulus will be much appreciated given the cliff the global economy is currently falling off, note that weekly jobless claims ramped higher, in what is expected to be the first of many chunky prints, while the Philly Fed posted its largest-ever drop.</p><h2>COVID-19:</h2><p><strong>US MEASURES: </strong>Senator Majority Leader McConnel is set to announce the Phase 3 stimulus package later on Thursday. The figure floating around is that it will be worth USD 1.3trln, with USD 300bln of that composed of delayed tax payments to the IRS. US President Trump tweeted that he only signed the Defense Production Act (DPA) to combat the “Chinese Virus” should the US need to invoke it in a worst-case scenario in the future, although he added that hopefully there will be no need. House Speaker Pelosi later said that she hopes he enforces the act as the US faces a large medical supply shortage.</p><p><strong>LONDON / UK: </strong>UK Chancellor Sunak is expected to announce an ‘unprecedented’ support package, including wage subsidies and tax cuts, on Friday, in addition to the already announced GBP 20bln support and GBP 330bln loan guarantee scheme, according to the FT. PM Johnson’s spokesperson announced that there is “zero” prospect of any restriction being place on travel in or out of London. Meanwhile, Whitehall sources, cited by Sky News, said most shops could close and transport could be restricted in London by the weekend under plans being considered by UK Government. Furthermore,<strong> </strong>Transport for London is adjusting its service operations in which it will shut the Waterloo &amp; City Line and close up to 40 stations, as well as suspend the night tube and night overground although night buses will still operate for essential journeys. The UK has also put the military on standby amid coronavirus; supermarkets are also expected to receive police support when London is placed into a lockdown, sources reported.<strong> </strong>Regarding<strong> </strong>fiscal support, some UK Senior Tory MPs (Duncan Smith/Jenkin/Clarke) are demanding immediate government action on pay/jobs support, against criticism that the Government’s announced measures will take too long to become effective.<strong> </strong>Later in the session, the UK Health official said the pressure on the health service in London will increase, where intensive care units will be first to see the pressure.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN MEASURES: </strong>German Ministers are yet to sign off on the EUR 40bln support package for small/medium Co's, could be in excess of EUR 40bln, according to Gov't sources.<strong> </strong>Furthermore, Handelsblatt's sources reported the German government wants to apply an exception to the debt brake rule that could happen at the Cabinet meeting on Monday. The Decision must be granted by the majority of Bundestag members, however. The article also mentioned that for small businesses, equipment aids worth several thousand Euros are being discussed. Italy announced it is to extend virus lockdown measures, with an extension of school closures beyond April 3rd. French Interior Minister says the Government will extend the lockdown period if it is necessary.</p><p><strong>SHORT SALE BANS: </strong>As several European exchanges implement short sale bans, regulator Bafin announced Stoxx 50 &amp; 600, MSCI Europe and MSCI EU are all exempt from short-selling prohibitions; restrictions apply to index-related instruments only if shares covered by prohibitions exceed respective demand thresholds expressed as a % of their weight; instruments related to index Euro Stoxx banks are also exempt from short-selling prohibitions.</p><p><strong>CHINA: </strong>China to step up fiscal stimulus including infrastructure investment (such as 5G networks) and is considering plans to cut its 2020 growth target to as low as 5% from 6% agreed in Dec</p><p><strong>CASE COUNT</strong> – figures provided today against previous provided Thursday: <strong>US </strong>total cases 10,442 (prev. 7,038), death toll 150 (prev. 97); NY State cases 4,152 (prev. 2,914). <strong>UK </strong>total cases 3268 (prev. 2,689), death toll 144 (prev. 99). <strong>ITALY</strong> total cases 41,035 (prev. 35,713), death toll 3405 (prev. 2978). <strong>FRANCE</strong> total cases 10,995 (prev. 9,134), death toll 372 (prev. 264). <strong>GERMANY</strong> total cases 13,944 (prev. 9,257). <strong>SPAIN</strong> total cases 17,147 (prev. 13,716); death toll 767 (prev. 558). <strong>NETHERLANDS</strong> total cases 2,460 (prev. 2051). <strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 8,565 (prev. 8,413); death toll 91 (prev. 84).</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED USD SWAP LINES: </strong>The Fed announced the establishment of temporary US dollar swap lines to an extended group of central banks. Supporting the provision of up to USD 60bln each for Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank. While offering USD 30bln each to the Danmarks Nationalbank, the Norges Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The Fed notes that these liquidity arrangements will be in place for six months; the existing swap lines with the BoC, BoE, BoJ, ECB and SNB remain. The move comes amid the global scramble for dollars, exhibited in the likes of xccy basis swaps widening, amongst other indicators, which has seen many amplify their calls on the Fed to increase the scope of its swap line agreements, which theoretically, should see funding pressures in global markets ease.</p><p><strong>FED MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND LIQUIDITY FACILITY:</strong> Otherwise known as MMLF, was announced overnight. The facility (previously used in the 2008/09 crisis) will provide loans to financial institutions secured by high-quality assets purchased by the financial institutions from money market mutual funds. This latest facility is aimed at supporting funds amid the market turmoil which will assist them in meeting redemption demand from households and other investors. Furthermore, the Treasury will provide USD 10bln, from its Exchange Stabilization Fund, of credit protection to the Fed.</p><p><strong>NY FED OPERATIONS: </strong>All<strong> </strong>USD 12.5bln bids in the 14-day Term repo operation (45bln offered) were accepted, meanwhile both the O/N operations were significantly undersubscribed too. As GC rates remain subdued, the lack of take up in Fed’s operation makes sense given PDs can access funding markets at rates within the Fed’s target range – likely a result of the Fed’s aggressive actions in credit markets.</p><p><strong>ECB PEPP: </strong>ECB announced EUR 750bln Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in which it will launch a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities to counter serious risks to monetary policy transmission mechanism. Purchases will be conducted until the end of 2020 and will include all the asset categories eligible under the existing asset purchase programme (APP). Furthermore, the GC said it is fully prepared to raise the size of programmes, as well as adjust composition by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. A waiver of the eligibility requirements for securities issued by the Greek government will be granted for purchases under PEPP. Elsewhere, ECB TLTRO3 3rd allotment had a strong take-up of EUR 115bln (prev. EUR 97.7bln).</p><p><strong>ECB'S LAGARDE</strong> said extraordinary times require extraordinary action, while she added there are no limits to our commitment to the Euro and are determined to use full potential of all our tools within our mandate.</p><p><strong>ECB’S VILLEROY </strong>said ECB is absolutely determined to fight fragmentation risk between Eurozone countries and noted it will buy more bonds if needed in this exceptional period, while he also stated that French banks are solid and do not need nationalisation.</p><p><strong>BANK OF ENGLAND CUTS BANK RATE TO 0.1% FROM 0.25%</strong> in a unanimous emergency move; increasing govts bonds and corp bond holding by GBP 200bln to GBP 645bln, saying COVID will result in economic shock that is sharp and large. It, therefore, voted unanimously to increase the Bank of England’s holdings of UK government bonds and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds by £200 billion to a total of £645 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Voted unanimously that the Bank of England should enlarge the TFSME scheme, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. The majority of additional asset purchases will comprise UK government bonds; will be completed as soon as it is operationally possible.</p><p><strong>BOE GOVERNOR BAILEY</strong> said the bank has scope to move further if required; time to act was now; rejects criticism that the move was monetary financing. Bailey said it is important that it has not scheduled anymore QE, and to move when needed. Adding that global central bankers are in very close contact. Bailey also stressed that negative interest rates not compatible with getting banks to lend.</p><p><strong>SNB LEFT POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT -0.75%</strong> as expected, CHF is “even more highly valued” vs. Prev. “highly valued”; SNB is intervening even more in FX markets. SNB is raising the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system. The threshold factor will increase from 25 to 30. SNB is examining whether a relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer would be possible despite the risks on the mortgage and real estate markets. The SNB will take additional steps to ensure liquidity as necessary. Even under this assumption, however, GDP growth is likely to be negative for the year as a whole. The return to normality from the second half of the year onwards could thereafter be reflected in strong positive growth in 2021.</p><p><strong>SNB GOVERNOR JORDAN:</strong> SNB can cut interest rates further in the future but it is unfavourable at the moment, Switzerland is not a currency manipulator; SNB does not intervene to get an advantage vs. other countries. Notes, there is no co-ordinated measures with other central banks. Talks are ongoing with Swiss Govt but its too early to give details of further supportive steps.</p><p><strong>RBA LOWERED CASH RATE TARGET BY 25BPS</strong> to 0.25% and announced to buy government bonds in the secondary market as speculated, which will commence on Friday. Furthermore, the RBA announced to offer 3yr funding (TFF) to authorized deposit-taking institutions with the facility valued at least AUD 90bln, while it stated that banks will have access to additional low-cost funding if they expand lending to businesses.</p><h2>DATA:</h2><p><strong>JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>rose to 281K from 211K, above the expected 220K and above the forecast range. Pantheon notes next week’s numbers will be an “order of magnitude worse” with this week’s figures taking a hit from the closures of bars and restaurants. “Our tentative forecast for next week is two-to-three million claims. We hope that will be the single worst week, but we can’t be sure. Even if we’re right, the drop in April nonfarm payrolls is likely to be of the order of five million,” the consultancy adds, noting that the shock will be so great that fiscal stimulus will be inevitable, suggesting a USD 2trln package aimed at households and SMEs.</p><p><strong>PHILLY FED INDEX </strong>tumbled lower to -12.7 from +36.7, below the expected +8.0, marking the survey’s largest ever one month drop<strong>. </strong>New orders fell to -15.5 from +33.6, while unemployment fell to +4.1 from +9.8, which Pantheon highlights will be followed by a “huge collapse” in April, with the sector in a deep recession for the foreseeable future.</p><p><strong>GERMAN IFO</strong> Prelim Business Climate Index (Mar) 87.7 (Prev. 96.1, Rev. 96.0); Current Conditions 93.8 (Prev. 98.9, Rev. 99.0); Expectations 82 (Prev. 93.4, Rev. 93.2) - Ifo notes that German economy is falling into recession.</p><p><strong>GERMAN DIW INSTITUTE</strong> said the virus outbreak is to massively impact the German economy in the next two quarters at lease, could turn out to be much more severe if uncertainty persists, German economy to shrink 0.1% in 2020 assuming optimistic V-shaped recovery.</p><h2>EQUITIES:</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.66% at 2,414, NDX +1.58% at 7,289, DJIA +0.95% at 20,087.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy +6.75%, Cons Disc +3.4%, Financials +2.25%, Materials +2.22%, Communication Svs +1.66%, Technology +1.11%, Industrials +0.33%, Real Estate -1.35%, Health -1.87%, Cons Stpl -2.91%, Utilities -5.47%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> On a broader theme, US President Trump said he does not want government aid to go to buybacks, noting he is not happy with buybacks.&nbsp; Trump later added that he would support the government an equity stake in some companies, saying aid is coming to airlines, cruise operators and hotels. Gilead (GILD) saw choppy trade amid US President Trump's coronavirus briefing which saw the name fall slightly as Trump made suggestions to other drugs being potentially used to help treat coronavirus patients, although quickly spiked on comments of promising therapies produced by GILD, albeit gains were short-lived. Moderna (MRNA) sunk after the FDA announced a vaccine trial is to take 1 year.&nbsp; Uber (UBER) saw heavy gains after comments from its CEO that it expects to have USD 6bln cash in hand by the end of the year with a USD 2bln revolving credit facility. CEO Khosrowshai, however, did note that its rides segment is seeing a 60-70% decline in the areas hit the worst from coronavirus, although it has plenty of cash to get through the crisis. WSJ sources noted Boeing (BA) is considering a dividend cut and possibly layoffs at its jetliner plans as it deals with the airline pressure from COVID-19. Meanwhile, CNBC noted lawmakers are reportedly wary of bailing out Boeing. Accenture (ACN) saw solid gains after a reporting solid revenue, while EPS was in line. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) managed to hold onto gains as oil prices bounce from prior day losses despite a debt downgrade to Junk from Moody’s. Tiffany’s (TIF) surged in late trade after reports suggested LVMH (MC FP) is to consider purchasing TIF shares on the open market.&nbsp;</p><h2>CRUDE:</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: </strong>WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 4.85 HIGHER (+23.81%) AT USD 25.22/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLES USD 3.59 HIGHER (+14.43%) AT USD 28.47/BBL.</p><p>Crude benchmarks bounced from the prior day declines where WTI outperformed Brent seeing the Arb narrow to just over 2 dollars from 5 the prior day - also marking WTI's largest ever one-day percentage gain. The crude complex found some support from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who stated the DoE is looking to purchase between USD 10-20bln worth of oil at low prices; more specifically, the DoE said it would buy 30mln bbls of crude by March 26th to add to the SPR while oil prices are low and it is to add the remainder of the 77mln bbls at a later date. Meanwhile, Shell (RDSA. LN) chartered a second supertanker at sea to store another 2mln bbls of oil to take advantage of the steeper contango across the term structure. Risk sentiment improved somewhat following the steep declines yesterday with equities trading in positive territory with gains being led by energy companies. Saudi Aramco stated it will carry on reducing operation levels at local refineries in April and May to bolster its export potential. Meanwhile, the Algeria Energy Minister stated there are signs oil demand will improve during H2 which will lift oil prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts at Citi highlight that although a bounce was seen today, it remains fragile, and the desk believes policy measures from monetary and fiscal side are welcome but “policymakers may simply lack the precision tools required to address the specific impact of the crisis”, highlighting lower US gasoline retail sales even before travel restrictions. The desk notes none of the proposals would directly put drivers back on the road.</p><p><strong>POST SETTLEMENT: </strong>Texas was reportedly mulling the curtailment of oil production for the first time in decades, according to WSJ citing sources.</p><h2>BONDS</h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 1 POINT 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 135-07.</strong></p><p><strong>THE TPLEX BULL STEEPENED </strong>after a recent acute sell-off in duration, alongside a bounce in equities. Desks note the improved risk sentiment and incoming fiscal and monetary stimulus has likely put a pause in forced liquidations in DM bonds. Furthermore, the Fed has been ramping up its Treasury purchases – with USD 100bln scheduled for purchase across Thursday and Friday. A large deluge of IG corporate supply didn’t buck the trend either after recent dry spells.

Citi notes it continues to expect a significant response in the Eurozone, while the ball is now in the hands of the fiscal government. JPY continued to weaken against the greenback amid broad dollar strength. Meanwhile, the BoJ purchased JPY 1trln JGB’s to stem the rising bond yields in an unscheduled purchase. As risk appetite fared better on Thursday&nbsp;<strong>AUD &amp; NZD were slightly firmer against a surging buck</strong>&nbsp;amid a 25bps rate cut from the RBA as expected while also initiating YCC (as inferred by Governor Debelle’s recent speech) by targeting the 3-year yield at 0.25%. The RBA decision saw limited reaction, although the Aussie and Kiwi benefited after the Federal Reserve expanded its US dollar swap line to RBA and RBNZ among others helping the Banks fund its dollar needs; It was also expanded to Norges Bank, Riksbank, BoK, Banxico, BCB, Danish and Singapore Central Bank.&nbsp;<strong>NOK traded firmer after the central bank announced it may intervene in FX markets</strong>&nbsp;following “historically large” weakness in the NOK, while noting it is continuously considering whether there is a need to intervene in the market by purchasing NOK.&nbsp;<strong>EURSEK weaker amid the fall in the single currency and from the US dollar swap line expansion</strong>.

Whereas <strong>RUB outperformed EMFX</strong> counterparts and is back beneath 80.00 against the greenback. <strong>TRY however fell victim</strong> to the rising oil prices<strong>. ZAR weakened</strong> after its deeper than expected unanimous 100bps rate cut, while also announcing it expects GDP to contract 0.2% in 2020 from its prior estimate of +1.2%. <strong>USDBRL saw choppy trade</strong> where the BCB unanimously cut its Selic rate by 50bps, deeper than the 25bps expected which saw USDBRL gap higher at the open, although trended lower to flat levels as trade progressed.&nbsp;</p>",

The crude complex found some support from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who stated the DoE is looking to purchase between USD 10-20bln worth of oil at low prices; more specifically, the DoE said it would buy 30mln bbls of crude by March 26th to add to the SPR while oil prices are low and it is to add the remainder of the 77mln bbls at a later date. Meanwhile, Shell (RDSA. LN) chartered a second supertanker at sea to store another 2mln bbls of oil to take advantage of the steeper contango across the term structure. Risk sentiment improved somewhat following the steep declines yesterday with equities trading in positive territory with gains being led by energy companies. Saudi Aramco stated it will carry on reducing operation levels at local refineries in April and May to bolster its export potential. Meanwhile, the Algeria Energy Minister stated there are signs oil demand will improve during H2 which will lift oil prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts at Citi highlight that although a bounce was seen today, it remains fragile, and the desk believes policy measures from monetary and fiscal side are welcome but “policymakers may simply lack the precision tools required to address the specific impact of the crisis”, highlighting lower US gasoline retail sales even before travel restrictions. The desk notes none of the proposals would directly put drivers back on the road.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>Almost a classic tale of 2 halves for the Aussie and Kiwi that are back on or near the 0.5900 handle vs their US counterpart, and well off overnight lows around 0.5508 and 0.5472 respectively. A broad upturn in risk sentiment (albeit ultimately after latest wild fluctuations) has helped the Antipodean Dollars claw back more of their recent losses, and Wednesday’s especially hefty declines, but the real game-changer appeared to be the Fed extending and expanding swap lines to the likes of the RBA and RBNZ. Similarly, the Norwegian and Swedish Krona are benefiting from direct Usd funding facilities and indirectly from the Euro’s demise, while signals from the Norges Bank about potential intervention on top of larger daily foreign currency purchases for budget purposes plus a decent rebound in oil prices are also supporting the Nok. Elsewhere, the Pound was already on the comeback trail after a woeful Wednesday, but Cable hit near 1.1800 recovery peaks and Eur/Gbp recoiled to circa 0.9124 even though the BoE held another extraordinary policy meeting to lower the Bank rate from 0.25% to 0.1% (base for the MPC) and unveil an extra Gbp200 bn APF. Meanwhile, the aforementioned recovery in crude has cushioned the Loonie from the worst of the Greenback’s ongoing rally as Usd/Cad consolidates around 1.4500 despite the <strong>DXY</strong> climbing briefly crossing 102.5000.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to all the above, Euro, Yen and Franc depreciation has accelerated throughout Thursday’s EU session, with Eur/Usd now sub-1.0700, Usd/Jpy clearly through 110.00 and Usd/Chf over 0.9850. The single currency has been undermined independently by the ongoing spread of nCoV across the bloc and yet more economic evidence of its toll via Ifo and drastic downgrades to GDP projections, while the BoJ continues to increase ETF purchases and the SNB raised its assessment of the Franc to even more highly valued after maintaining benchmark rates, but lifting NIRP exemptions for banks and stating that it has been compelled to intervene more.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Aside from all else, the Rand has had digested aggressive SARB action in the form of a full point rate cut vs -50 bp expected, but the Rouble has gleaned traction from a Brent revival and CBR intervention. Hence, Usd/Zar surpassing 17.5000 at one stage, while Usd/Rub has drifted back from around 81.9080.</p>",

However, the real catalyst seemed to be the Fed rolling out more swap lines to smooth Usd funding and liquidity strains with notable rebounds in the Aud and Nzd that nudged the DXY back below 102.000. Nevertheless, trade remains extremely erratic and fluid across the asset and currency spectrum, with Bunds now succumbing to a fresh bout of selling as more German Government officials indicate a suspension of the debt brake on the grounds of extenuating coronavirus circumstances.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed announced to launch mutual money market fund facility to lend to financial institutions which it said will help meet demands for redemptions by households and other investors to enhance credit provisions throughout the economy.&nbsp; Furthermore, the program includes USD 10bln of credit protection from US Treasury Exchange Stabilization Fund. (Newswires)</strong></p><p><strong>New York Fed plans to purchase USD 100bln in Treasury purchases over Thursday and Friday. (Newswires)</strong></p><p><strong>SNB left Policy Rate unchanged at -0.75% as expected, CHF is “even more highly valued” vs. Prev. “highly valued”; SNB is intervening even more in FX markets</strong>. <strong>SNB is raising the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system. The threshold factor will increase from 25 to 30.</strong> SNB is examining whether a relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer would be possible despite the risks on the mortgage and real estate markets. The SNB will take additional steps to ensure liquidity as necessary. Even under this assumption, however, GDP growth is likely to be negative for the year as a whole. The return to normality from the second half of the year onwards could thereafter be reflected in strong positive growth in 2021. (SNB)</p><p><strong>SNB Governor Jordan</strong>: <strong>SNB can cut interest rates further in the future but it is unfavourable at the moment, Switzerland is not a currency manipulator</strong>; SNB does not intervene to get an advantage vs. other countries. Notes, there is <strong>no co-ordinated measures </strong>with other central banks. <strong>Talks are ongoing with Swiss Govt but its too early to give details of further supportive steps</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Norges Bank state that, due to the recent moves in the NOK, they may intervene in the market via the purchase of NOK</strong>; are to offer extraordinary F-loans to banks, as of March 19th; will have a 1-week, 1-month, 3, 6 &amp; 12 month maturities; all will be fully allotted (Norges Bank)</p><p><strong>RBA lowered Cash Rate Target by 25bps to 0.25% and announced to buy government bonds in secondary market as speculated, which will commence on Friday. Furthermore, the RBA announced to offer 3yr funding (TFF)</strong> to authorized deposit taking institutions with the facility valued at least AUD 90bln, while it stated that banks will have access to additional low-cost funding if they expand lending to businesses. (Newswires)</p><p>BoJ January Meeting Minutes noted that most members stated they must be mindful of downside risks to the economy but momentum for hitting price target is sustained. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets extended on losses with price action turbulent as ongoing coronavirus fears and disruptions</strong>, which now threatens to lockdown New York and London, offset the various global policy efforts to tackle the fallout including the ECB announcement of a EUR 750bln Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and RBA rate cut with QE. <strong>The announcement by the ECB initially boosted US equity futures and propelled Euro Stoxx 50 futures higher by over 3%, although the momentum then waned</strong> which fully wiped out the earlier gains. <strong>ASX 200 (-3.4%)</strong> swung between gains and losses heading into the off-schedule RBA monetary policy announcement which despite the RBA actions, did little to support the Australian benchmark which was heavily pressured by a collapse in the real estate sector, energy and financials. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.0%)</strong> also gave back opening gains with Tokyo exporters weighed by the safe haven flows into the domestic currency and with participants diminishing risk ahead of tomorrow’s holiday closure. <strong>Hang Seng (-2.6%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%)</strong> were subdued as the coronavirus jitters continue to ruffle markets and as earnings also entered the fray including Hong Kong heavyweight Tencent which missed on its Q4 net. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued and continued to test support at 151.00 where prices have found a base. The BoJ were also active in the market today in which it announced 2 unscheduled special operations to purchase a total of JPY 1.3tln of JGBs although this only briefly underpinned prices, while Japanese CPI data and outdated BoJ minutes from the January meeting were largely ignored given that the data was mixed and meeting was prior to the blow up of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.0522 vs. Exp. 7.0486 (Prev. 7.0328)</strong></p><p>Japanese National CPI (Feb) Y/Y 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.7%).

Fresh Food &amp; Energy (Feb) Y/Y 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.8%)</p><p>Japanese Bank lobby head said the economy has been impacted more seriously by the coronavirus than was expected. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>Whitehall sources said most shops could close and transport could be restricted in London by the weekend under plans being considered by UK Government. (Sky News)</p><p>Transport for London adjusted its service operations in which it will shut the Waterloo &amp; City Line and close up to 40 stations, as well as suspend the night tube and night overground although night buses will still operate for essential journeys.

UK’s FTSE 100 (-1.7%) lags despite the GBP weakening to multi-decade lows, as the announced European package failed to reverberate into the sentiment across the channel. Meanwhile the DAX 30 (-0.6%) lost steam amid a bleak Ifo Survey and a string of downbeat economic forecasts from various institutes, all forecasting a 2020 German recession. Italy’s FTSE MIB (+2.1%) remains underpinned by the 3-month long short ban sale coupled with the ECB announcement. European sectors are all higher and largely reflect risk appetite, although Consumer Staples and Telecoms outperform given as the ongoing lockdown prompts additional broadband usage and stockpiling of staple goods. Swiss Banks meanwhile received a fleeting boost in light of the SNB monetary policy announcement in which it sweetened its tiering terms to a multiple of 30x from 25x, Swiss Banks remain supported with UBS higher to the tune of 7%.

Indeed, the DXY has just posted a new ytd peak at 102.020 and closer to the next bullish technical objective at 102.260.</p><p>NZD/JPY/EUR/AUD/CHF/GBP - All trailing further behind the Buck, as the Kiwi lags within a gaping 0.5472-0.5748 range and Yen loses even more of its safe-haven premium alongside Gold between 109.55-107.87 parameters. Meanwhile, the Euro is testing bids/support around the 1.0800 handle in wake of another bleak German business survey (Ifo echoing downbeat ZEW sentiment readings) and multi GDP downgrades via economic institutes, and the Aussie is languishing just above 0.5700 after RBA QE and more emergency funding, albeit off worst levels close to 0.5500 at one stage overnight. Elsewhere, the Franc is still mixed around 0.9750 and 1.0550 against the single currency following the SNB maintaining policy and only reinforcing NIRP intentions alongside stronger FX interventions despite upgrading its valuation of the unit to even more high from high. Last, but by no means least, scant reprieve for Sterling as Cable only clambers back from circa 1.1475 lows to 1.1500 awaiting a probable London lockdown and a likely further delay to Brexit negotiations resuming given that the EU’s chief representative Barnier contracting COVID-19.</p><p>CAD/SCANDI/EM - The Loonie is doing better than most to resist its US peer’s advances, but still prone either side of 1.4500 if oil prices tank again and/or risk aversion really picks up, in the same vein as the Norwegian and Swedish Crowns as the former has only gleaned a degree of support from the Norges Bank hinting an direct intervention to supplement increased regular daily foreign currency purchases announced yesterday.

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>In spite of concerted if not quite coordinated attempts to intervene, the Greenback remains on an upward trajectory and extending gains vs all G10 counterparts plus the bulk of EM currencies, with very few exceptions, like the Rouble that has clawed back some losses following CBR buying aimed at preventing Brent and Ural crude from caving too far below Usd25/brl. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> has just posted a new ytd peak at 102.020 and closer to the next bullish technical objective at 102.260.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/EUR/AUD/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>All trailing further behind the Buck, as the Kiwi lags within a gaping 0.5472-0.5748 range and Yen loses even more of its safe-haven premium alongside Gold between 109.55-107.87 parameters. Meanwhile, the Euro is testing bids/support around the 1.0800 handle in wake of another bleak German business survey (Ifo echoing downbeat ZEW sentiment readings) and multi GDP downgrades via economic institutes, and the Aussie is languishing just above 0.5700 after RBA QE and more emergency funding, albeit off worst levels close to 0.5500 at one stage overnight. Elsewhere, the Franc is still mixed around 0.9750 and 1.0550 against the single currency following the SNB maintaining policy and only reinforcing NIRP intentions alongside stronger FX interventions despite upgrading its valuation of the unit to even more high from high. Last, but by no means least, scant reprieve for Sterling as Cable only clambers back from circa 1.1475 lows to 1.1500 awaiting a probable London lockdown and a likely further delay to Brexit negotiations resuming given that the EU’s chief representative Barnier has contracted COVID-19.</p><p><strong>CAD/SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Loonie is doing better than most to resist its US peer’s advances, but still prone either side of 1.4500 if oil prices tank again and/or risk aversion really picks up, in the same vein as the Norwegian and Swedish Crowns as the former has only gleaned a degree of support from the Norges Bank hinting an direct intervention to supplement increased regular daily foreign currency purchases announced yesterday. As noted above, the Rub is the notable ‘outperformer’, though not before more pronounced weakness that triggered CBR action, while the Zar is trading defensively in the run up to the SARB that is expected to cut rates by 50 bp.</p>",

Perhaps the onerous anti-coronavirus rescue plan put together by the Chancellor is still hampering UK bonds ahead of DMO issuance in the form of Gbp3.25 bn 2025 supply, or simply a preference to wait and what else the BoE has in store next week. Meanwhile, Short Sterling contracts are mixed, with the long end outperforming on the basis that the MPC has signalled only 15 bp lies between the current benchmark rate and lower bound.</p>",

The announcement by the ECB initially boosted US equity futures and propelled Euro Stoxx 50 futures higher by over 3%, although the momentum then waned which fully wiped out the earlier gains. ASX 200 (-1.0%) swung between gains and losses heading into the off-schedule RBA monetary policy announcement which despite the RBA actions, did little to support the Australian benchmark which was heavily pressured by a collapse in the real estate sector, energy and financials. Nikkei 225 (-2.5%) also gave back opening gains with Tokyo exporters weighed by the safe haven flows into the domestic currency and with participants diminishing risk ahead of tomorrow’s holiday closure. Hang Seng (-3.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) were subdued as the coronavirus jitters continue to ruffle markets and as earnings also entered the fray including Hong Kong heavyweight Tencent which missed on its Q4 net, while the biggest mover was the Philippines PSEi which dropped as much 24% on resumption from a 2-day halt due to coronavirus concerns and with its capital city currently on lockdown. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued and continued to test support at 151.00 where prices have found a base. The BoJ were also active in the market today in which it announced 2 unscheduled special operations to purchase a total of JPY 1.3tln of JGBs although this only briefly underpinned prices, while Japanese CPI data and outdated BoJ minutes from the January meeting were largely ignored given that the data was mixed and meeting was prior to the blow up of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>Prudential (PRU LN) – </strong>Are to acquire FWD’s Thai Insurance Unit for USD 754mln.

(-1.4%)</strong> were subdued as the coronavirus jitters continue to ruffle markets and as earnings also entered the fray including Hong Kong heavyweight Tencent which missed on its</p><p>Q4 net, while the biggest mover was the Philippines PSEi which dropped as much 24% on resumption from a 2-day halt due to coronavirus concerns and with its capital city currently on lockdown. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued and continued to test support at 151.00 where prices have found a base. The BoJ were also active in the market today in which it announced 2 unscheduled special operations to purchase a total of JPY 1.3tln of JGBs although this only briefly underpinned prices, while Japanese CPI data and outdated BoJ minutes from the January meeting were largely ignored given that the data was mixed and meeting was prior to the blow up of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

(Sky News)</p><h2>FX</h2><p>In FX, the <strong>DXY</strong> remained firm and above the 101.00 handle amid higher yields and as the panic selling across asset classes spurred a demand for cash, while its major counterparts were subdued in which <strong>EUR/USD</strong> languished around the 1.0900 level after the prior day’s walloping it took against the greenback was eventually eased by support at 1.0800, and the pair also found some brief reprieve from news of the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. <strong>GBP/USD</strong> remained subdued around 1.1500 after having slipped to its lowest levels in around 35 years as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to shutdown London. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> was higher and momentarily broke above 109.00 which was due to the strength of the greenback as most JPY-crosses succumbed to the safe haven flows. Antipodeans nosedived in which <strong>AUD/USD</strong> and <strong>NZD/USD</strong> both slipped to test the 0.5500 level amid the spooked risk tone, recent slump in commodities and heading into the RBA decision where it cut rates and announced to conduct QE for the first time as widely speculated. Furthermore, <strong>AUD/NZD</strong> recently fell below parity for the first time since its float, while better than expected Australian Employment Change and a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.1% from 5.3% was largely ignored with participants preferring to focus on the March numbers given the recent substantial industry lay-offs due to coronavirus.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment Change (Feb) 26.7k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 13.5k).

(Newswires)</p><h2>COMMODITIES</h2><p><strong>Commodities were mostly weaker</strong> amid the continued sell-off across global markets as investors ploughed into the greenback which saw <strong>gold</strong> prices slip further away from the USD 1500/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> also took a hit overnight on the spooked risk sentiment and amid heavy selling of commodities as Shanghai metals trade got underway in which Shanghai front month copper prices declined around 9% at the open. Conversely, <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures saw some reprieve overnight with gains of nearly 12%, although it still has far to go to recoup the prior session’s 24% drop in prices to its lowest since 2002 where it briefly tested USD 20/bbl amid the panic selling across markets and reports that Saudi’s Energy Minister directed Aramco to continue supplying crude at a rate of 12.3mln BPD over the coming month.</p><h2>US</h2><p>The TPLEX continued its bear steepener amid a flight to cash seen across all major assets. The offer was most severe in APAC trade as US equity futures hit their limit down. The lift in equities after the US cash open also saw some support for the TPLEX, although ultimately proved short-lived. In the background participants are digesting the mass global fiscal stimulus packages being proposed, which will ramp-up supply. Furthermore, desks note the continued unwind of relative value and basis trades that have been blown up lately, in addition to wider profit-taking in the context of the pronounced drop in rates in the wake of the virus outbreak. By settlement, 2s/10s +7bps to around 63bps, levels not seen since 2018, with the 10-year yield +16bps to 1.16%; note that the 30-year yield reached close to 2% at one point. T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point 22 ticks lower at 134-12.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower with price action turbulent as ongoing coronavirus fears and disruptions, which now threatens to lockdown New York and London, has offset the various global policy efforts to tackle the fallout including the latest by the ECB which unveiled a EUR 750bln Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. The announcement initially boosted US equity futures and propelled Euro Stoxx 50 futures higher by over 3%, although the momentum has since waned and the earlier gains fully retraced. ASX 200 (-1.9%) swung between gains and losses as the looming off-schedule RBA monetary policy announcement added to the cautiousness. Nikkei 225 (-2.5%) also gave back opening gains as it was weighed by the safe haven flows into the domestic currency and with participants paring risk ahead of tomorrow’s holiday closure. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-5.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.6%) are subdued as the coronavirus jitters continue to ruffle markets and with earnings also entering the fray including Hong Kong heavyweight Tencent which missed on its Q4 net, while the biggest mover was the Philippines PSEi which dropped as much 24% on resumption from a 2-day halt due to coronavirus concerns and with its capital city currently on lockdown.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firm and above the 101.00 handle amid higher yields and as the panic selling across asset classes spurred a demand for cash, while its major counterparts are subdued as EUR/USD is flat around the 109.00 level after the prior day’s walloping it took against the greenback was eventually eased by support at 1.0800, and the pair also found some brief reprieve from news of the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. GBP/USD remains subdued around 1.1500 after having slipped to its lowest levels in around 35 years as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to shutdown London. USD/JPY is higher and broke above 109.00 which is due to the strength of the greenback as most JPY-crosses succumb to the safe haven flows. Antipodeans nosedived in which AUD/USD and NZD/USD both slipped to test the 0.5500 level amid the spooked risk tone, recent slump in commodities and ahead of a potential RBA rate cut and/or unprecedented QE announcement. Furthermore, AUD/NZD fell below parity for the first time since its float, while better than expected Australian Employment Change and a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to 5.1% from 5.3% was largely ignored ahead of the RBA and with participants preferring to focus on the March numbers given the recent substantial industry lay-offs from the coronavirus fallout.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued but off lows after finding support at 151.00 and with the BoJ also announcing an unscheduled Rinban operation of JPY 1tln, with price action relatively stable after mixed CPI data and outdated BoJ minutes from the January meeting which was prior to the blow up of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>",
