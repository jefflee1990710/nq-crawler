The abatement in scrambling for dollars is likely supporting credit markets too, where CDX IG has tightened beneath 100bps (this was above 150bp a few sessions ago and debt-driven ETFs (such as LQD, HYG, JNK, MUB, etc.), are all meaningfully off their lows (especially MUB); IFR noted that high-grade borrowers are expected to make a new weekly primary volume record as the figure is set to rise above USD 90bln.

US House Majority Leader Hoyer's office stated the House will convene at 0900EDT on Friday to consider the bill and it expected the bill will pass by voice vote, while there were also comments from House Speaker Pelosi that she is optimistic the bill will pass in the House and suggested there will be further legislation from Congress to address the coronavirus. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, in a CNBC interview, said direct deposits to Americans will take place within three weeks, urging the House to pass the bill as soon as possible.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED CHAIR POWELL </strong>said the Fed has the ability to use emergency lending, there is unlimited authority to lend; Powell said there could be a good rebound, and Fed is trying to ensure rebound is vigorous. US may already be in a recession; not a blank cheque, but Fed will lend aggressively, does not see risks around the Fed's recent actions, and says the Fed will not run out of ammunition when it comes to upcoming lending.</p><p><strong>ECB </strong>stated that the self-imposed issuer limits used in QE will not apply to the temporary pandemic emergency purchase programme, according to the legal text. Subsequently, <strong>ECB'S VASILIAUSKAS</strong> said OMT is part of the ECB's toolbox and could be used. Additionally, ECB begun purchases under the emergency programme, PEPP, on Thursday.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>There was little by way of new takeaways from the MPC's latst rate decision. Policy settings were unanimously kept unchanged (rates at 0.1%, total stock of asset purchases at GBP 645bln), and the Bank indicated a willingness to boost asset purchases further if needed (Governor Bailey has previously indicated a reticence to take rates negative). Commentary around the virus outbreak was striking: the MPC said the economic consequences of covid were becoming more apparent, and that there was risk of longer-term damage to the economy. It also said it has little evidence to assess the precise magnitude of the economic shock. However, it did state that the virus shock will prove temporary, particularly if job losses and business failures can be minimised. Pantheon Macroeconomics said investors may be slightly disappointed that the BOE did not follow the FOMC by committing to open-ended asset purchases of government bonds. The consultancy argues that the MPC has not formally adopted a policy of yield curve targeting, but implicitly it stands ready to step up the pace or ultimate size of its gilt purchases, if yields surge again. \"Granted, the Committee seems to expect a V-shaped recovery from the virus, and it expects that sterling’s depreciation will lift CPI inflation above the 2% target next year, but for now, the Committee remains focussed on the crisis immediately before it; its expectations for rebounds in GDP and inflation won’t cause it to hold back in the near-term.\" Pantheon believes that QE will be escalated, should financial conditions deteriorate again, and the MPC likely will not wait until its next meeting on 7th May, if swifter action is required.</p><p><strong>RIKSBANK</strong>, in an emergency move, said it is initiating purchases of commercial paper, and will temporarily enlarge counterparties list, to improve credit supply to companies. On April 2nd, it will purchase SEK 4bln of CP issued in SEK issued by non-financial contributions.</p><h2>REST OF WORLD</h2><p><strong>G7 FOREIGN MINISTERS </strong>failed to agree on a statement on Wednesday as the Trump administration insisted on referring to the coronavirus outbreak as the Wuhan virus, something it could not find support for from the group.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US JOBLESS CLAIMS</strong>: As was widely expected, US initial jobless claims surged to a record high 3.28mln, topping te 695k claims seen in October 1982. The true picture could be much worse, according to Capital Economics, which noted that there are good reasons to believe that understandable constraints on the capacity of offices to process claims. The consultancy cites the California data, which showed less than 200k claims last week, whereas CapEco's own tracking information suggests that claims have already reached 1mln. \"Based solely on the historical relationship between claims and the unemployment rate, 3,283,000 equates to an unemployment rate of somewhere between 30% and 40%,\" CapEco writes, \"we are not suggesting the latter will rise to those levels, but we would be amazed if it didn’t exceed 10% by May, if not April.\" It also says that there will be a very significant drop back in unemployment when the number of new coronavirus infections fall and the economy begins to reopen, but it won’t reverse all of these losses. \"The unemployment rate could remain elevated for years.\"</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 1.89 LOWER AT USD 22.60/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 1.05 LOWER AT USD 26.34/BBL.</strong></p><p><strong>CRUDE FUTURES TRUNDLED LOWER AFTER SPR BUYING PLAN BREAKS DOWN</strong>, failing to benefit from the pick up in equities. Note the losses were most acute in WTI following the US DoE pulling its plan to buy American oil through the SPR after the latest stimulus bill did not include such funding; although the DoE later said it still has funds for oil purchases and is in dialogue with Congress to work something out. The prospect of the SPR buying US oil had helped provide some support to the battered energy complex in recent weeks, although with this feature now seemingly evaporated, it takes the market into an even more dire environment as participants face a drop off in global demand, in addition to the ongoing supply glut. Hammering home the point, industry sources were cited on Thursday suggesting that Saudi is struggling to find buyers for its crude exports amid the demand fall off and raised freight costs. Highlighting such woes also on Thursday was IEA’s Birol, who expects a significant decline in oil demand in Q1 and even larger in Q2, suggesting global oil demand could fall by as much as 20mln BPD (20%), where a recovery would be neither easy or quick; Birol also noted that global oil storage capacity may be full very soon. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs forecasts oil demand to to fall by 10.5mln BPD in March and 18.7mln BPD in April, adding that a demand shock of this magnitude will overwhelm any supply response including core-OPEC freeze or cut.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 12+ TICKS HIGHER AT 137-23+.</strong></p><p>THE TPLEX BULL STEEPENED as front-end Bills continued to decline into negative territory. The Fed’s monetary bazooka continues to alleviate funding pressures as O/N collateral rates remained low and minimal take-up in the repo operations, while demand in the reverse repo op continues to balloon - the negative yields in Bills are supporting Dealers’ move to park cash at the Fed. The negative front-end is also likely pushing participants further out the curve in search of yield. Elsewhere, the Treasury’s 7-year note auction was well-received, stopping through the 0.707% WI by 2.7bps, covered 2.76x (more than the six-auction average of 2.45x), and consistent with other recent auctions, dealers continue to take more than usual. By settlement, 2s10s +0.5bps at 54bps; 2-year -5bps at 0.281% and 10-year -3bps at 0.827%.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> </strong>+5.94% at 2623, NDX +5.72% at 7897, DJIA +6.24% at 22,523</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Utilities +8.39%, Real Estate +7.81%, Health +6.98%, Financials +6.43%, Industrials +6.41%, Technology +6.35%, Energy +6.24%, Communication Svs +6.05%, Cons Stpl +5.67%, Materials +4.94%, Cons Disc +4.3%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, as according to WSJ sources, has indicated that the US would take stakes in airline names, in return for billions worth of direct grants, as part of the USD 2trln stimulus package. Airlines were strongly bid after the stimulus bill, which contains USD 58bln in aid for the industry, passed the Senate; Boeing (BA) made more double digit gains off of this. Bristol Myers (BMY) was bid on a multiple sclerosis treatment receiving FDA approval. Micron (MU) made decent gains after its strong earnings report and guidance, although analysts remain cautious. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) announced it will not make rent payments in April as its cash flow dives lower.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p>As month-end approaches, JPMorgan says navigating the next four trading days will not be easy; the bank notes that liquidity is coming at a premium and intraday ranges are significant without a great deal of news driving price action and advises traders to size accordingly.</p><p><strong>USD:</strong> While bank's rebalancing models point towards USD buying into month/quarter-end, the dollar has seen downside on Thursday, as lawmakers in the Senate approved the fiscal stimulus bill, ahead of a House vote on Friday. Additionally, a record high jobless claims print gave the dollar a further kick down, though we were heading in that direction anyway. Desks have noted that central bank liquidity measures are working, and as a result, demand for dollars is easing, as seen in the narrowing of major cross currency basis. The DXY gave up the 100.00 handle in European trade, and later broke through 99.50.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> Further desks note that Japan's GPIF is reportedly raising its allocation target for foreign bonds, from 15% to 25%; and it could be as high as 31% as it also widens the permissible range of deviation from the allocation target. Although it saw little reaction in the JPY, RBC says it brings another source of buyers for international bonds, the hedging decisions mean the currency impact may be negligible. Changes are not showing up yet in the data yet, and the weekly portfolio data overnight, showed net foreign bond purchases were close to flat for a second week running. Separately, analysts are watching yen cross-currency basis, as the USD tightness continues to ease basis has narrowed; this could impact fixed income hedging behaviour, as it becomes cheaper to hedge dollars.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Month-end factors may play a role in the days ahead, some analysts have argued; in particular, JPMorgan said Friday is the 'value month-end' which can often signify supply of EURUSD, and it told its clients that fading rallies today at around 1.10 would seem sensible enough, although the pair sits above the figure heading into APAC trade.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> The BoE meeting did little for the pound, which is on course for a third straight day of gains against the EUR and the USD. Since Tuesday, GBPUSD has for the most part been straddling 1.1830 region (23.6% of March fall), and today's dollar weakness allowed cable to move just below 1.2200.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> Risk currencies had a bid tone, largely sponsored by the USD downside after lawmakers made progress on fiscal stimulus. While the dollar basis has eased in major FX like EUR and JPY, it is less so with the Aussie, which technicians say may be a reason why AUD has not vaulted the 0.6075-0.6150 resistance area.</p>",

The prospect of the SPR buying US oil had helped provide some support to the battered energy complex in recent weeks, although with this feature now seemingly evaporated, it takes the market into an even more dire environment as participants face a drop off in global demand, in addition to the ongoing supply glut. Hammering home the point, industry sources were cited on Thursday suggesting that Saudi is struggling to find buyers for its crude exports amid the demand fall off and raised freight costs. Highlighting such woes also on Thursday was IEA’s Birol, who expects a significant decline in oil demand in Q1 and even larger in Q2, suggesting global oil demand could fall by as much as 20mln BPD (20%), where a recovery would be neither easy or quick; Birol also noted that global oil storage capacity may be full very soon. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs forecasts oil demand to to fall by 10.5mln BPD in March and 18.7mln BPD in April, adding that a demand shock of this magnitude will overwhelm any supply response including core-OPEC freeze or cut.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 12+ TICKS HIGHER AT 137-23+.</strong></p><p>THE TPLEX BULL STEEPENED as front-end Bills continued to decline into negative territory. The Fed’s monetary bazooka continues to alleviate funding pressures as O/N collateral rates remained low and minimal take-up in the repo operations, while demand in the reverse repo op continues to balloon - the negative yields in Bills are supporting Dealers’ move to park cash at the Fed. The negative front-end is also likely pushing participants further out the curve in search of yield. Elsewhere, the Treasury’s 7-year note auction was well-received, stopping through the 0.707% WI by 2.7bps, covered 2.76x (more than the six-auction average of 2.45x), and consistent with other recent auctions, dealers continue to take more than usual. By settlement, 2s10s +0.5bps at 54bps; 2-year -5bps at 0.281% and 10-year -3bps at 0.827%.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> </strong>+5.94% at 2623, NDX +5.72% at 7897, DJIA +6.24% at 22,523</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Utilities +8.39%, Real Estate +7.81%, Health +6.98%, Financials +6.43%, Industrials +6.41%, Technology +6.35%, Energy +6.24%, Communication Svs +6.05%, Cons Stpl +5.67%, Materials +4.94%, Cons Disc +4.3%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, as according to WSJ sources, has indicated that the US would take stakes in airline names, in return for billions worth of direct grants, as part of the USD 2trln stimulus package. Airlines were strongly bid after the stimulus bill, which contains USD 58bln in aid for the industry, passed the Senate; Boeing (BA) made more double digit gains off of this. Bristol Myers (BMY) was bid on a multiple sclerosis treatment receiving FDA approval. Micron (MU) made decent gains after its strong earnings report and guidance, although analysts remain cautious. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) announced it will not make rent payments in April as its cash flow dives lower.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p>As month-end approaches, JPMorgan says navigating the next four trading days will not be easy; the bank notes that liquidity is coming at a premium and intraday ranges are significant without a great deal of news driving price action and advises traders to size accordingly.</p><p><strong>USD:</strong> While bank's rebalancing models point towards USD buying into month/quarter-end, the dollar has seen downside on Thursday, as lawmakers in the Senate approved the fiscal stimulus bill, ahead of a House vote on Friday. Additionally, a record high jobless claims print gave the dollar a further kick down, though we were heading in that direction anyway. Desks have noted that central bank liquidity measures are working, and as a result, demand for dollars is easing, as seen in the narrowing of major cross currency basis. The DXY gave up the 100.00 handle in European trade, and later broke through 99.50.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> Further desks note that Japan's GPIF is reportedly raising its allocation target for foreign bonds, from 15% to 25%; and it could be as high as 31% as it also widens the permissible range of deviation from the allocation target. Although it saw little reaction in the JPY, RBC says it brings another source of buyers for international bonds, the hedging decisions mean the currency impact may be negligible. Changes are not showing up yet in the data yet, and the weekly portfolio data overnight, showed net foreign bond purchases were close to flat for a second week running. Separately, analysts are watching yen cross-currency basis, as the USD tightness continues to ease basis has narrowed; this could impact fixed income hedging behaviour, as it becomes cheaper to hedge dollars.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Month-end factors may play a role in the days ahead, some analysts have argued; in particular, JPMorgan said Friday is the 'value month-end' which can often signify supply of EURUSD, and it told its clients that fading rallies today at around 1.10 would seem sensible enough, although the pair sits above the figure heading into APAC trade.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> The BoE meeting did little for the pound, which is on course for a third straight day of gains against the EUR and the USD. Since Tuesday, GBPUSD has for the most part been straddling 1.1830 region (23.6% of March fall), and today's dollar weakness allowed cable to move just below 1.2200.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> Risk currencies had a bid tone, largely sponsored by the USD downside after lawmakers made progress on fiscal stimulus. While the dollar basis has eased in major FX like EUR and JPY, it is less so with the Aussie, which technicians say may be a reason why AUD has not vaulted the 0.6075-0.6150 resistance area.</p>",

Note the losses were most acute in WTI following the US DoE pulling its plan to buy American oil through the SPR after the latest stimulus bill did not include such funding; although the DoE later said it still has funds for oil purchases and is in dialogue with Congress to work something out. The prospect of the SPR buying US oil had helped provide some support to the battered energy complex in recent weeks, although with this feature now seemingly evaporated, it takes the market into an even more dire environment as participants face a drop off in global demand, in addition to the ongoing supply glut. Hammering home the point, industry sources were cited on Thursday suggesting that Saudi is struggling to find buyers for its crude exports amid the demand fall off and raised freight costs. Highlighting such woes also on Thursday was IEA’s Birol, who expects a significant decline in oil demand in Q1 and even larger in Q2, suggesting global oil demand could fall by as much as 20mln BPD (20%), where a recovery would be neither easy or quick; Birol also noted that global oil storage capacity may be full very soon. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs forecasts oil demand to to fall by 10.5mln BPD in March and 18.7mln BPD in April, adding that a demand shock of this magnitude will overwhelm any supply response including core-OPEC freeze or cut.</li></ul>",

In fact, many suspect that the real tally could be even higher given the confinement constraints imposed to contain COVID-19 and closure of offices collating and processing benefit applications, so next Thursday’s number could be similar if not bigger. The index was already looking vulnerable to a deeper retreat and duly lost grip of the psychological century handle on the way through technical support at 99.800 (38.2% Fib retracement of the 94.650-102.990 move from ytd base to apex), plus 99.667 (former peak from October 2019) to leave 99.500 exposed.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/NZD/AUD/EUR/CHF/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All extending gains vs the Greenback, as Cable rebounds further from last week’s pre-2000 lows just pips away from 1.1400 to circa 1.2130, albeit from a loftier sub-1.1800 platform and not really gleaning much from the BoE or UK retail sales data. For the record, the MPC let policy alone after 2 emergency meetings to cut rates and also increase the APF at the latter one when the Bank rate was reduced to the lower bound, while headline consumption was considerably weaker than forecast, but consigned to the pre-nCoV pile of economic indicators. Elsewhere, the Yen ignored a decent upturn in risk sentiment in stocks if not all assets to probe above 109.50, with Buck weakness overshadowing any loss of safe-haven appeal. On that note, the previously underperforming non-US Dollars took advantage of their counterpart’s ongoing demise as the Kiwi and Aussie recovered from around 0.5780 and 0.5870 respectively to 0.5950+ and 0.6060+, while the Loonie resumed its revival to test offers/resistance close to 1.4000. Returning to Europe, round numbers were breached by the Euro and Franc, at 1.1000 and 0.9700, with the latter also scaling 0.9650 at one stage.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned accelerated Usd reversal coupled with renewed risk appetite came to the rescue of Scandinavian Crowns and regional currencies that were floundering, including the Czk irrespective of the CNB’s more aggressive than envisaged rate cut (-75 bp vs -50 bp consensus) and dovish policy guidance. Note, Governor Rusnok revealed that there is a covert level for FX intervention, but refused to air what the line in the sand is.</p>",

The consultancy cites the California data, which showed less than 200k claims last week, whereas CapEco's own tracking information suggests that claims have already reached 1mln. \"Based solely on the historical relationship between claims and the unemployment rate, 3,283,000 equates to an unemployment rate of somewhere between 30% and 40%,\" CapEco writes, \"we are not suggesting the latter will rise to those levels, but we would be amazed if it didn’t exceed 10% by May, if not April.\" It also says that there will be a very significant drop back in unemployment when the number of new coronavirus infections fall and the economy begins to reopen, but it won’t reverse all of these losses. \"The unemployment rate could remain elevated for years.\"</p>",

It also said it has little evidence to assess the precise magnitude of the economic shock. However, it did state that the virus shock will prove temporary, particularly if job losses and business failures can be minimised.&nbsp;</li><li>Pantheon Macroeconomics said investors may be slightly disappointed that the BOE did not follow the FOMC by committing to open-ended asset purchases of government bonds. The consultancy argues that the MPC has not formally adopted a policy of yield curve targeting, but implicitly it stands ready to step up the pace or ultimate size of its gilt purchases, if yields surge again. \"Granted, the Committee seems to expect a V-shaped recovery from the virus, and it expects that sterling’s depreciation will lift CPI inflation above the 2% target next year, but for now, the Committee remains focussed on the crisis immediately before it; its expectations for rebounds in GDP and inflation won’t cause it to hold back in the near-term.\"&nbsp;</li><li>Pantheon believes that QE will be escalated, should financial conditions deteriorate again, and the MPC likely will not wait until its next meeting on 7th May, if swifter action is required.</li></ul>",

However, Eur/Usd has now breached resistance ahead of 1.0900 to test 1.0950 before the next set of upside chart levels at 1.0964 and 1.0981 that are protecting 1.1000 where 1 bn option expiries roll off.

Elsewhere, the Pound has been choppy again as Cable settles down around the 1.1900 handle having been up to circa 1.1960 from sub-1.1800 lows at one stage and now waiting for the BoE after largely shrugging off UK retail sales given that the reported figures pre-dated nCoV.

WTI futures lurk under USD 24/bbl while its Brent counterpart eyes 26.50/bbl to the downside, with both benchmarks around session lows at the time of writing. Participants will be closely watching today’s G20 call; sources expect the oil market to be discussed, at least as part of the wider economy, although an outright oil market discussion was rebuffed by Russia’s Kremlin. The Trump Administration also reportedly asked Saudi Arabia to hold off on plans to ramp up production to 12.3mln BPD in April (vs. 9.7mln BPD in March), whilst also asking the Kingdom to bring oil prices back to levels before the crude crash – a sign that US suppliers cannot tolerate prolonged periods of sub-30/bbl prices. The sources added that Saudi has no intention of changing course at the moment as it attempts to force Russia’s hand into production curtailments. Interestingly, in 1986 the US attempted to convince Saudi to abandon the price war at the time, an attempt that proved to be futile and the price war continued for another six months. Elsewhere<strong>, spot gold</strong> remains subdued and meanders around the USD 1600/oz – with investors favouring govt debt and haven FX in flights to safety given the yellow metal’s recent liquidity-induced selloff. <strong>Copper </strong>prices move in tandem with the risk aversion and almost reversed yesterday’s gains, albeit the red metal keeps its head above 2/lb.</p><p>CME raised COMEX 5000 silver futures maintenance margins by 12.5% to USD 9000/contract and raised palladium futures NYMEX margins by 13.2% to USD 43000/contract from USD 38000/contract.

Finally, <strong>Barclays (-2.2%)</strong> experiences headwinds from lower yields and mounting doubts regarding its promised GBP 1.03bln dividend pay-out next week.</p><p><strong>FX</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY</strong> - A marked change of fortunes amidst yet another twist in the risk roller-coaster has propelled the Yen back to the top of the major ranks and dragged Usd/Jpy down from 111.50+ peaks through 111.00 on the way towards 109.80, with Yen crosses also retreating even though other G10 currencies are benefiting from a more pronounced pull-back in the Greenback and DXY in return (index now hovering near the base of a new, lower 101.020-100.330 range).</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong> - The single currency continues to track broader Buck and overall sentiment movements rather than COVID-19 Eurozone economic contagion evident most recently in a much more pronounced deterioration in Gfk German consumer confidence and the IW institute warning that GDP could contract by 10% at worst. However, Eur/Usd has now breached resistance ahead of 1.0900 to test 1.0950 before the next set of upside chart levels at 1.0964 and 1.0981 that are protecting 1.1000 where 1 bn option expiries roll off. Similarly, the Franc is eyeing higher ground vs the Dollar at 0.9700, while keeping pace with the Euro as the cross meanders between 1.0653-20.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD/GBP</strong> - All firmer against the Usd, albeit less so and more wary about renewed risk aversion, with the Kiwi cresting 0.5850, Loonie testing 1.4150 and Aussie capped into 0.6000. Elsewhere, the Pound has been choppy again as Cable settles down around the 1.1900 handle having been up to circa 1.1960 from sub-1.1800 lows at one stage and now waiting for the BoE after largely shrugging off UK retail sales given that the reported figures pre-dated nCoV. Note, our full preview of the March MPC policy meeting is available via the Research Suite.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong> - Some loss of bullish momentum due to further erosion of risk appetite and a downturn in crude alongside other commodities, but the Swedish Krona has also had to contend with worrying declines in industrial and consumer morale, while the Czech Koruna is conscious that the CNB is widely tipped to lower rates by another 50 bp on top of the emergency ease of the same magnitude, and may even signal QE.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core bonds remain bid, albeit off peaks as the Eurozone periphery and French OATs continue to outperform on ECB PEPP factors, as debt markets await words from the FOMC chair before the spotlight switches to the UK for the official March policy confab. However, <strong>Gilts</strong> did forge a fresh 135.82 Liffe peak prior to easing back and market contacts note a bullish <strong>Short</strong> <strong>Sterling</strong> futures trade via options in advance of midday with the Jun20 99.875 middle butterfly netted for 1.25 and 1.5 ticks in 25k lots. Looking a bit further ahead, US weekly claims will be the pm data highlight amidst ramped up COVID-19 expectations, but Usd32 bn 7 year supply also rounds off this week’s <strong>Treasury</strong> issuance remit.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures continue to bleed as sentiment ticks back into broad risk aversion and with underlying fundamentals still bearish for both the demand and supply side of the equation. <strong>WTI</strong> futures lurk under USD 24/bbl while its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart eyes 26.50/bbl to the downside, with both benchmarks around session lows at the time of writing. Participants will be closely watching today’s G20 call; sources expect the oil market to be discussed, at least as part of the wider economy, although an outright oil market discussion was rebuffed by Russia’s Kremlin. The Trump Administration also reportedly asked Saudi Arabia to hold off on plans to ramp up production to 12.3mln BPD in April (vs. 9.7mln BPD in March), whilst also asking the Kingdom to bring oil prices back to levels before the crude crash – a sign that US suppliers cannot tolerate prolonged periods of sub-30/bbl prices. The sources added that Saudi has no intention of changing course at the moment as it attempts to force Russia’s hand into production curtailments. Interestingly, in 1986 the US attempted to convince Saudi to abandon the price war at the time, an attempt that proved to be futile and the price war continued for another six months. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> remains subdued and meanders around the USD 1600/oz – with investors favouring govt debt and haven FX in flights to safety given the yellow metal’s recent liquidity-induced selloff. <strong>Copper</strong> prices move in tandem with the risk aversion and almost reversed yesterday’s gains, albeit the red metal keeps its head above 2/lb.</p>",

Meanwhile, the Short Sterling strip is fractionally above parity and marginally steeper awaiting the official March BoE policy meeting to see if the MPC delivers anything else in the form of stimulus, albeit probably not anticipating much given that rates have already been slashed to the lower bound and APF reinstated. On that note, the next 3 buy-back tranches are due in the pm and have been mostly supportive for the 10 year benchmark.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he approved disaster declarations by various states and said probably some sections of the country can return to work before other sections</strong>. President Trump also stated Congress is very close to passing stimulus bill and that he will sign coronavirus relief bill as soon as it reaches his desk, while he added they are open to more stimulus and suggested they will go back for more money if needed. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US House Majority Leader Hoyer's office stated the House will convene at 0900EDT on Friday to consider the bill</strong> and it expected the bill will pass by voice vote, while there were also comments from House Speaker Pelosi that she is optimistic the bill will pass in the House and suggested there will be further legislation from Congress to address the coronavirus.

In related news, China and US are expected to set aside their coronavirus blame game and focus on the challenges of the pandemic when G20 leaders hold a video conference today. (Washington Post/Twitter/SCMP)</p><p><strong>Italy COVID-19 total cases rose to 74,386 (prev. 69,176) and the death toll rises to 7,503 (prev. 6,820).</strong> There were also comments from Italian PM Conte that the government is working on extra measures to support the economy on the same scale as the EUR 25bln already announced.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asia equity markets traded cautiously amid headwinds from the US where most major indices finished in the green although pulled back heading into the Wall St. close</strong> after the USD 2tln coronavirus relief bill hit a snag at the Senate. This follows reports GOP Senators Graham, Sasse and Scott noted they won't speed up the bill until a drafting error in the stimulus bill is addressed which otherwise could provide an incentive for employees to be laid off, while Democrat Senator Sanders threatened he will demand restrictions on USD 500bln fund for corporates if the 3 Republican Senators do not drop their objections to unemployment insurance expansions. Nonetheless, the bill was eventually passed via unanimous vote which gets sent to the House for a vote on Friday. <strong>ASX 200 (+2.3%)</strong> gained as the RBA remained active in its QE efforts and with notable outperformance in tech and defensive sectors such as healthcare and utilities. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-5.0%)</strong> was heavily pressured as exporters including index heavyweight Fast Retailing staggered on the detrimental currency flows and with SoftBank also among the worst hit after its credit rating was downgraded 2 notches and deeper into junk status by Moody’s, while participants were also ruffled by the Tokyo Governor’s requests for residents to stay at home during the weekend to curb the spread of COVID-19. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.9%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%)</strong> were indecisive as focus also shifted to earnings including the upcoming releases by the Big 4 banks which are set to begin announcing their results from today. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher due to the underperformance of risk sentiment in Japan and following similar rebound in T-notes, with weaker results at the latest 40yr JGB auction doing little to stall the overnight bond rally.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and sold CNY 10bln of 6-month bills in Hong Kong.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> softened and retreated back below the 101.00 level amid the brief stimulus bill snag at the Senate. Nonetheless, the greenback’s losses were limited amid mixed price action in its major counterparts and ahead of today’s US GDP and jobless claims data, as well as Fed Chair Powell’s rare televised interview at 0705EDT. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> extended on its gains but was off its highs as it battled to hold on to the recently reclaimed 1.0900 handle and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated after a failed attempt at 1.1900. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped firmly below 111.00 owing to the continued USD-reversal although eventually found a base around 110.50, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were choppy as the ill-effects to the high beta currencies from the indecisive risk tone was offset following a surprise firmer fixing by the PBoC and the unanimous passage of the record stimulus bill at the US Senate.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were subdued amid the indecisive risk tone overnight which kept <strong>oil</strong> prices rangebound around USD 24.00/bbl after the prior session’s choppy performance where the latest EIA inventory report showed a narrower than expected build, albeit still at an increase compared to the surprise draw seen in the latest private sector inventories. Furthermore, there were mixed comments overnight from Goldman Sachs which suggested the significant expected drop to demand this and next month would overshadow any action by OPEC, but also suggested risks of a potential sharper rebound for Brent crude in Q4. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were stuck around the USD1600/oz level and failed to benefit from the pull back in USD, while <strong>copper</strong> conformed to the lacklustre tone across the complex amid the mixed risk tone and weakness in its largest purchaser China.</p><p>CME raised COMEX 5000 silver futures maintenance margins by 12.5% to USD 9000/contract and raised palladium futures NYMEX margins by 13.2% to USD 43000/contract from USD 38000/contract. (Newswires)</p><p>Goldman Sachs forecasts oil demand to fall by 10.5mln bpd in March and 18.7mln bpd in April, while it suggested that a demand shock of this magnitude will overwhelm any supply response including core-OPEC freeze or cut. However, Goldman Sachs also noted it is seeing increasingly risks of a price rebound to be sharper than its base-case rally back to USD 40/bbl for Brent by Q4 2020. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>There were reports of explosions in Baghdad's Green Zone in Iraq and that sirens are sounding at the US Embassy, while other reports noted that 2 rockets were launched at the Green Zone area. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX bull steepened on Wednesday, likely catching momentum from the short-end, where some Bills crossed into negative rates. With a strong take-up in the Fed’s reverse repo operation, and low overnight collateral rates, dealers have enough cash for the time being, which is potentially pushing them into Bills. Furthermore, the Treasury’s 5-year note auction was well received, stopping through the 0.55% WI by 1.5bps, while covering 2.53x (above the six-auction average of 2.42x), dealers took a larger share than usual, but one desk notes the strong takeup as not a “hot-potato toss”, but rather a desire for the notes, instead of immediately selling them. Meanwhile, the belly to long-end likely saw less of a bid due to the equity rally, as well as the increased corporate supply. By settlement, 3m -6bps at -0.0457%, 2s -4.5bps at 0.332%, 10s +3.5bps at 0.853%, 30s +4.5bps at 1.414%. Spreads: 2s10s +4.4bps at 51bps, 2s30s +6.5bps at 108bps; 3-month FRA-OIS +5bps at 106bps. T-note (M0) futures settled 3+ ticks lower at 137-11.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade cautious amid headwinds from the US where most major indices finished in the green although pulled back heading into the close after the USD 2tln coronavirus relief bill hit a snag at the Senate. This follows reports GOP Senators Graham, Sasse and Scott noted they won't speed up the bill until a drafting error in the stimulus bill is addressed which otherwise could provide an incentive for employees to be laid off, while Democrat Senator Sanders threatened he will demand restrictions on USD 500bln fund for corporates if the 3 Republican Senators do not drop their objections to unemployment insurance expansions. ASX 200 (+1.9%) is led higher as the RBA remain active in its QE efforts and with notable outperformance in tech and defensive sectors such as healthcare and utilities, while Nikkei (-3.8%) is heavily pressured as exporters including index heavyweight Fast Retailing stagger on the detrimental currency flows and with SoftBank also among the worst hit after its credit rating was lowered 2 notches and deeper into junk status by Moody’s. Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were also indecisive as focus also shifts to earnings including the upcoming releases by the Big 4 banks which are set to begin announcing their results from today.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY softened and has retreated back below the 101.00 level amid the stimulus bill snag at the Senate and with the recent stronger than expected headline Durable Goods data doing little to spur the currency. Nonetheless, the greenback’s losses are limited amid mixed price action in its major counterparts with EUR/USD off its highs as it struggles to hold on to the recently reclaimed 1.0900 handle and with GBP/USD consolidating after a failed attempt at 1.1900. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped firmly below 111.00 owing to the continued USD-reversal although eventually found a base around 110.50, while antipodeans are choppy alongside the indecisive risk tone and following a surprise firmer fixing by the PBoC.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher due to the underperformance of risk sentiment in Japan and following similar rebound in T-noted, but with gains capped ahead of a 40yr auction later.</p>",
