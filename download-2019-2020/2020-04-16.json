Futures before the US cash open had indicated strength, although downside was felt shortly after the open, particularly in value-oriented sectors such as Industrials, Energy and Financials (MS, like other large US banks, missed estimates as it grew its credit provisions) leading the losses, and remaining the underperformers as indices retraced ground in the latter part of the session; note, heavy losses in Boeing (BA) saw the DJIA underperform the SPX, while strong gains in momentum/growth names (primarily located in the tech/telecoms sector) saw the NDQ outperform, particularly as Amazon’s (AMZN) COVID-induced rally continued. Morgan Stanley (MS) earnings missed expectations although its sales and trading revenues were solid, particularly FICC which came in at 2.2bln, much firmer than expectations. Blackrock (BLK) beat on EPS and revenue although AUM missed, BLK also raised its dividend. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) saw solid EPS &amp; revenue beats while it only had 169mln in credit provisions. Elsewhere, Abbott ABT) beat on EPS, revenue was in-line, it suspended FY guidance but say Worldwide Medical Device sales grew 1.4% and FreeStyle Libre worldwide sales +49.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) saw a solid report. SPX +0.59% at 2800, NDX +1.93% at 8758, DJIA +0.14% at 23538.</p><p>The Treasury bid continued as equities slumped lower in recent ranges, with the shape of the curve bull-flattening; the Treasury Bond June future move over one-and-a-half points upwards, while the 2-year futures were little changed. By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3.5bps at 0.60%, and 30s -7bps at 1.20%. Similar to Wednesday, the lions’ share of strength came in the European session before the upward trajectory levelled-off in later trade, with real money accounts reportedly still heavy sellers into the Fed’s buyback operations. Further, as yields hit two-week lows, investors were likely cautious about extending the move. For instance, 2-year yield secular low was 0.143% on 9/20/2011, today’s low print of 0.187% is the lowest of this recent rally, a mere 4bps, or 2+/32, off the lows. More broadly, some Bond market participants have likely been enticed into longs given recent dismal data points, while value proxies in the equity market lead losses. In credit, Lipper data showed USD 5.184bln of inflows into investment grade rated funds in the latest week, the first inflow in six weeks, while HY rated funds saw their third week of inflows, a sign of stabilisation in the market, no doubt the Fed’s latest Primary/Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities will be reinvigorating investors as the bank has shown its commitment to backstopping credit markets. It is worth noting also that FRA-OIS spreads widened slightly amid USD LIBOR rose after eight consecutive declines; white strip Eurodollars were offered. US T-note futures (M0) settled 2+ ticks higher at 139-07+.</p>",

Futures before the US cash open had indicated strength, although downside was felt shortly after the open, particularly in value-oriented sectors such as Industrials, Energy and Financials (MS, like other large US banks, missed estimates as it grew its credit provisions) leading the losses, and remaining the underperformers as indices retraced ground in the latter part of the session; note, heavy losses in Boeing (BA) saw the DJIA underperform the SPX, while strong gains in momentum/growth names (primarily located in the tech/telecoms sector) saw the NDQ outperform, particularly as Amazon’s (AMZN) COVID-induced rally continued. Meanwhile, The TPLEX’s bull-flattening continued, with debate growing on whether stocks and bonds have resumed their pre-COVID correlation, or if the bond market knows something the equity market doesn’t. The Dollar strengthened as activity currencies gave back recent strength. Meanwhile, crude futures gyrated to the rhythm of equity appetite, although found some additional strength on some Saudi and Russia jawboning just prior to the US cash equity close.</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Thursday (via state official health departments) against Wednesday:</strong></i></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>US </strong>cases rise 4.5% to 632,548 (prev. +4.6% at 605,390), death toll rises 9.9% to 27,012 (prev. +10.5% at 24,582).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NEW YORK</strong> death toll rises 5% to 12,192 (prev. +6.9% at 11,586).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SPAIN </strong>cases rise to 182,816 (prev. 177,633), death toll rises to 19,130 (prev. 18,579).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY </strong>cases +2.3% to 168,941 (Prev. +1.6% at 165,155); death toll 2.4% to 22,170 (prev. +2.7% at 21,645).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>GERMANY </strong>cases rise to 130,450 (+2,866) deaths stand at 3,569 (+315).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FRANCE </strong>cases rise +2.5% to 108,847 (prev. +5.5% to 106,206), death toll rises 4.4% to 17,920 (prev. +9.1% at 17,167).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK </strong>cases rise to 103,093 (prev. 98,476), death toll rises 6.69% to 13,729 (prev. +6.29% at 12,868).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CANADA </strong>cases rise to 28,899 (prev. 27,540), death toll rises to 1,048 (prev. 954).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>cases rise to 26,732 (prev. 26,336), death toll rises to 1,017 (prev. 973).</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Eleven Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats made dangerous and harassing actions against six US naval ships in international waters in the North Arabian Gulf, while US crews took action deemed appropriate to avoid a collision. Elsewhere, Chinese Foreign Ministry says that the US’ false accusations regarding nuclear testing are not worth refuting.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The SBA said it is currently unable to enrol a new Paycheck Protection Program at this time. The USD 350bln of PPP had been depleted earlier on in the session, as was widely touted at in recent sessions. The Democrats and Republicans are still negotiating, and some had hoped they would come to an agreement on Friday. However, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated both sides are still far apart, and to deepen the woes, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said there has been “absolutely no progress” among lawmakers to come to an agreement. Top House GOP McCarthy said today that he sees no reason to offer a “fig leaf” to the Democrats on the small business funding bill. Trump tweeted that the Democrats are blocking funding for the PPP and calls on them to support refilling funds. Note, some banks, such as Wells Fargo, stated they would continue to prepare for SBA loans.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump said the aggressive strategy is working and data suggests the nation has passed the peak on new coronavirus cases. Furthermore, President Trump added he will be announcing new guidelines on reopening the economy on Thursday at 1800 ET / 23:00 GMT.</p><p><strong>TRUMP SENATE NOMINEES:</strong> Trump urged the Senate to confirm his nominees to vacancies across the administration or formally adjourn and threatened to use executive powers to try and force both chambers of Congress to adjourn, while Senate Majority Leader McConnell later spoke with President Trump and pledged to find ways to confirm Trump nominees critical to fighting coronavirus although noted it will require consent from the Democratic leader.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED:</strong> The NY Fed will begin a regular publication of its Weekly Economic Index (WEI) from Thursday, which will provide timely information on the state of the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>PBOC</strong> said that it will maintain the normalisation of monetary policy for as long as possible and will keep room for monetary policy adjustments. The bank will also continue to guide credit funds to support smaller firms through RRR targeted cuts, re-lending and other measures.</p><p><strong>ECB</strong> provided a temporarily relief for capital requirements for market risk, which temporarily allows lower capital requirements with the aim of maintaining market making activities and liquidities; the ECB will review the decision in six months.</p><p><strong>ECB PRESIDENT LAGARDE</strong> said the bank is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. It will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy. Assessing further requests for Euro swap lines. ECB’s <strong>Schnabel</strong> said that a rate cut would not have helped at a time (March 12th) when profits at banks were already under pressure.</p><p><strong>RBNZ GOVERNOR ORR</strong> said negative interest rates have not been ruled out, while he added that they are at the end of the beginning regarding monetary stimulus and suggested negative rates remain on the table as well as direct financing.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> French President Macron said EU countries have no choice but to set up a fund that could issue common debt with a common guarantee, the FT reported. Macron added that the fund would allow member states to finance according to their needs, rather than size of their economies. Italy will “never” activate the ESM bailout fund but might agree to use it if the EU summit (April 23rd) decides to remove conditions on its use, according to the Industry Minister cited by ANSA. Meanwhile, Italy reportedly expects its 2020 budget deficit at 9-10% of GDP, according to a government source, who added the forecast includes the deficit impact of the stimulus package set to be approved this month. Later in the session, Eurogroup Chief Centeno said Europe needs to be more imaginative to tackle the virus, and is mulling EU-wide taxation.</p><p><strong>UK</strong> has extended its lockdown measures for another three weeks, as was expected following the government’s COBRA meeting today. Foreign Secretary Raab said it would not be responsible to pre-judge what experts will say in three weeks’ time.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>WEEKLY INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS</strong> printed 5.245mln in the week ending April 11th; analysts had expected 5.105mln (range:1.4-8.0mln), from a revised 6.61mln. Oxford Economics said the data now appears to have reached a “vertiginous plateau.” The consultancy now anticipates the official nonfarm payrolls data for April will show a loss of 24 million jobs and the unemployment rate spiking to 14%, while the participation rate will fall beneath 60%. “While some jobs will be recouped as activity rebounds, we don’t expect the economy to reach the February 2020 level of employment until early 2022.” And for the jobless claims themselves, Oxford Economics says that while it now appears that we have passed the peak in layoffs, “jobless claims are poised to remain extraordinarily high in coming weeks as the economy plunges deeper into a recession.” NOTE: Next’s week’s initial jobless claims will coincide with the survey period for the BLS’ Employment Situation Report.</p><p><strong>PHILLY FED:</strong> The headline collapsed to -56.6 in April, a larger fall than the -30.0 expected, from the prior -12.7, and the lowest print since 1980. The forward-looking 6-month expectations index, however, was up just shy of eight points to 43.0, although new orders plunged to -70.9 from -15.5. The details chime with the grim Empire Manufacturing report out on Wednesday. “Manufacturing is in the midst of a broad-based and significant retrenchment,” Oxford Economics said, “the silver lining is that manufacturers believe the downturn will be short-lived, but the recovery is likely going to be very gradual given the severity of the recession.” OxEco adds that manufacturing is facing “gale-force headwinds in the form of sharply weaker demand, supply chain disruptions, tight financial conditions and historic levels of uncertainty,” and that even once activity begins to eventually rebound, “the recovery is likely to be slow and risks being uneven across various manufacturing sectors.”</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (K0) SETTLED UNCHANGED AT USD 19.87/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 0.13 HIGHER AT USD 27.82/BBL</strong></p><p>Crude markets furloughed earlier strength to settle subdued on Thursday. The benchmarks had made gains in European trade alongside risk appetite/equity futures. However, as the US session got underway, momentum was lost, and prices found their way into negative territory. Specific to energy markets, news flow has been light. On Wednesday evening it was reported that Texas oil regulators would meet on April 21st to further discuss potential production limits after the meeting on Tuesday failed to yield results. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (COP) announced it is production by approximately 100k BPD to a gross 35k BOD; added that it is cutting production across Canada and the US until market conditions improve. Elsewhere, Russia’s St. Petersburg’s oil terminal said the country has almost run out of spare storage space in Western regions.</p><p><strong>OPEC MONTHLY OIL MARKET REPORT</strong> slashed its 2020 global oil demand growth forecast by 6.9mln BPD from the prior report. Q2 contraction is expected to be around 12mln BPD, with April seeing the largest contraction of around 20mln BPD (note IEA said April could be as low as -29mln BPD). OPEC sees 2020 global oil demand in Q3 contracting about 6mln BPD and around 3.5mln BPD in Q4. The market surplus was expected to reach around 15mln BPD in Q2 2020. Preliminary data indicates that global oil supply in March increased by 620k BPD to average of 99.86mln BPD, up 910k BPD Y/Y.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 139-07+.</strong></p><p>The Treasury bid continued as equities slumped lower in recent ranges, with the shape of the curve bull-flattening; the Treasury Bond June future move over one-and-a-half points upwards, while the 2-year futures were little changed. By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3.5bps at 0.60%, and 30s -7bps at 1.20%. Similar to Wednesday, the lions’ share of strength came in the European session before the upward trajectory levelled-off in later trade, with real money accounts reportedly still heavy sellers into the Fed’s buyback operations. Further, as yields hit two-week lows, investors were likely cautious about extending the move. For instance, 2-year yield secular low was 0.143% on 9/20/2011, today’s low print of 0.187% is the lowest of this recent rally, a mere 4bps, or 2+/32, off the lows. More broadly, some Bond market participants have likely been enticed into longs given recent dismal data points, while value proxies in the equity market lead losses. In credit, Lipper data showed USD 5.184bln of inflows into investment grade rated funds in the latest week, the first inflow in six weeks, while HY rated funds saw their third week of inflows, a sign of stabilisation in the market, no doubt the Fed’s latest Primary/Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities will be reinvigorating investors as the bank has shown its commitment to backstopping credit markets. It is worth noting also that FRA-OIS spreads widened slightly amid USD LIBOR rose after eight consecutive declines; white strip Eurodollars were offered.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.59% at 2800, NDX +1.93% at 8758, DJIA +0.14% at 23538.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -3.97%, Financials -1.74%, Industrials -0.84%, Real Estate -0.6%, Materials -0.53%, Utilities +0.07%, Communication Svs +0.43%, Cons Stpl +0.8%, Technology +1.24%, Cons Disc +1.94%, Health +2.2%.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Morgan Stanley (MS) earnings missed expectations although its sales and trading revenues were solid, particularly FICC which came in at 2.2bln, much firmer than expectations. Blackrock (BLK) beat on EPS and revenue although AUM missed, BLK also raised its dividend. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) saw solid EPS &amp; revenue beats while it only had 169mln in credit provisions. Elsewhere, Abbott ABT) beat on EPS, revenue was in-line, it suspended FY guidance but say Worldwide Medical Device sales grew 1.4% and FreeStyle Libre worldwide sales +49.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) saw a solid report.</p><p><strong>STOCK NEWS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) is to boost its wearables business by launching over-ear headphones. Costco (COST) raised its quarterly dividend to USD 0.70/shr. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is reportedly in talks to purchase a significant stake in Arcus Biosciences (RCUS). Baxter International (BAX) is seeing a surge of demand for its good. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is reportedly retooling its website to sell fewer items as it deals with a surge of order volumes, according to WSJ citing sources – the stock lead gains in the Discretionary sector. Starboard withdrew their director candidates to eBay’s (EBAY) board. Ford (F) China sales -34.9% Y/Y, although it gained 2.2% market share. Netflix (NFLX) continued its rise benefiting from a PT upgrade at Goldman Sachs to a tied street-high of USD 490/shr and expects it to report earnings better than estimates next week.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The grind in the buck followed on from yesterday and is now back above 100. Yesterday, the rise was largely a part of sour risk sentiment, although today sentiment was mixed. Equities flirted between positive and negative territory with the three major indices mixed. The coronavirus impact is clearly showing in data now, there were 5mln initial jobless claims, a slower pace from last two weeks, while Philly Fed saw a grim release, particularly forward-looking new orders which printed -70.9 from a prior -15.5.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> EURUSD continues to sell off amid broad dollar strength while comments from ECB President Lagarde noted the bank is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programme as much as necessary and for as long as needed, adding they will explore all options to support the economy while the bank is assessing requests for Euro swap lines.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> As expected, the UK government extended the lockdown by three more weeks (May 7th, from today). GBP was also a victim of the greenback which saw cable back beneath 1.25 to find support just above 1.24. Analysts at Lloyd’s suggest a breakthrough 1.2440 “will suggest we have made a lower high within a developing range earlier than expected, with 1.2175-1.2050 the main support/target.” New Jersey COVID cases +6% to 75317 (prev. +3% to 71,030).</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The Aussie is weaker today amid risk sentiment, given the cyclical nature of the currency. Overnight, some support was provided after its unemployment rate ticked up less than expected to 5.2% (exp. 5.7%), while employment rose by 5.9k, a large beat on the expected -40k. However, RBC highlight that the survey period took place in the beginning of March and therefore does not take into account the whole COVID-19 impact.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> Weaker today amid risk appetite, but particularly weaker than its antipodean counterpart after dovish commentary from RBNZ Governor Orr who noted the bank is not ruling out negative rates. The comment saw NZD trade beneath 0.60 throughout the session to lows of 0.5923.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> Out of the cyclicals saw relative outperformance and trades only marginally weaker against the buck with little seen in reaction to Feb. manufacturing sales. Canadian bank Scotia writes “CAD remains a slave to markets flows as trading conditions remain thin and somewhat illiquid it appears”.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen failed to benefit from its haven characteristics as the dollar continues to take haven flows. However, some of the price action could be impacted by PM Abe, who declared a nationwide national emergency. The government, however, has decided on a cash handout of JPY 100k per citizen, according to reports.</p><p><strong>MXN:</strong> The peso was the clear underperformer in the EMFX space after Mexico was downgraded from Fitch to BBB-; Outlook Stable (prev. BBB; outlook negative) and says economic shock from coronavirus will result to a severe recession in Mexico. JP Morgan state that this downgrade shows “Mexico is seemingly on a path of deterioration of business confidence and regulatory institutional framework that could hamper the macroeconomic outlook in the longer run”.</p><p><strong>RUB:</strong> The Ruble was firmer today despite a rising dollar and continued weakness in crude prices (although to a lesser extent than recent days). Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry said it will inject USD 26bln into the economy from the national wealth fund if oil prices remain where they are now, while its planned measures to fight the coronavirus crisis will cost 2.8% of GDP.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The Treasury bid continued as equities slumped lower in recent ranges, with the shape of the curve bull-flattening; the Treasury Bond June future move over one-and-a-half points upwards, while the 2-year futures were little changed. By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3.5bps at 0.60%, and 30s -7bps at 1.20%. Similar to Wednesday, the lions’ share of strength came in the European session before the upward trajectory levelled-off in later trade, with real money accounts reportedly still heavy sellers into the Fed’s buyback operations. Further, as yields hit two-week lows, investors were likely cautious about extending the move. For instance, 2-year yield secular low was 0.143% on 9/20/2011, today’s low print of 0.187% is the lowest of this recent rally, a mere 4bps, or 2+/32, off the lows. More broadly, some Bond market participants have likely been enticed into longs given recent dismal data points, while value proxies in the equity market lead losses. In credit, Lipper data showed USD 5.184bln of inflows into investment grade rated funds in the latest week, the first inflow in six weeks, while HY rated funds saw their third week of inflows, a sign of stabilisation in the market, no doubt the Fed’s latest Primary/Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities will be reinvigorating investors as the bank has shown its commitment to backstopping credit markets. It is worth noting also that FRA-OIS spreads widened slightly amid USD LIBOR rose after eight consecutive declines; white strip Eurodollars were offered.</p>",

However, as the US session got underway, momentum was lost, and prices found their way into negative territory. Specific to energy markets, news flow has been light. On Wednesday evening it was reported that Texas oil regulators would meet on April 21st to further discuss potential production limits after the meeting on Tuesday failed to yield results. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (COP) announced it is production by approximately 100k BPD to a gross 35k BOD; added that it is cutting production across Canada and the US until market conditions improve. Elsewhere, Russia's St. Petersburg's oil terminal said the country has almost run out of spare storage space in Western regions.</li><li><strong>OPEC MONTHLY OIL MARKET REPORT</strong> slashed its 2020 global oil demand growth forecast by 6.9mln BPD from the prior report. Q2 contraction is expected to be around 12mln BPD, with April seeing the largest contraction of around 20mln BPD (note IEA said April could be as low as -29mln BPD). OPEC sees 2020 global oil demand in Q3 contracting about 6mln BPD and around 3.5mln BPD in Q4. The market surplus was expected to reach around 15mln BPD in Q2 2020. Preliminary data indicates that global oil supply in March increased by 620k BPD to average of 99.86mln BPD, up 910k BPD Y/Y.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>More dire US data in the form of jobless claims (topped consensus, but below last week’s record high and the upper end of estimate range) and another worrying regional Fed survey (Philly findings just as bleak if not more concerning than NY manufacturing yesterday) only stalled the Buck’s latest recovery rally for a while. Indeed, the Greenback remains firm and on track to net gains vs its major counterparts, bar a very select few, with the index trying to establish a foothold back above 100.000 between 100.190-99.585 parameters.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has been flagging ever since RBNZ Governor Orr reaffirmed dovish policy guidance overnight via NIRP, more QE and even direct financing, with Nzd/Usd unable to revisit 0.6000 even during bouts of relative risk-on trade. Conversely, its Aussie neighbour has managed to reclaim 0.6300+ status as the Aud/Nzd cross inches towards 1.0600 in wake of pre-full coronavirus lockdown jobs data that beat forecasts on payroll and unemployment rate counts. Meanwhile, the Loonie has been choppy tracking crude undulations, but mostly off post-BoC lows within a 1.4136-1.4062 range and with some fleeting support from Canadian manufacturing sales exceeding expectations before acknowledging the downward revision that almost offset the margin of upside and of course mindful of the fact that March will see significant payback if Wednesday’s -9% monthly GDP projection by the stats office proves accurate.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also enduring volatile Thursday sessions, albeit largely underperforming against the Dollar with the Euro never really comfortable on the 1.0900 handle, but propped by decent option expiries layered down to 1.0840 into the NY cut before breaking lower and also gleaning some impetus from the usual 4 pm London fix buying vs the Pound that kept the cross above 0.8700 to the detriment of Cable. In fact, Sterling had already relinquished 1.2500 and is now sub-1.2450 following dovish/downbeat commentary from BoE’s Tenreyro on balance and awaiting news on an anticipated extension to UK measures to combat the COVID-19 spread. Elsewhere, fluctuations in risk sentiment fed through to the safe-haven Franc and Yen, but left them both strong vs the single currency and broader cross terms.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Crowns have overcome several wobbles to emerge on the front foot against the Euro, if not the Buck, irrespective of choppy oil prices and benign Swedish inflation forecasts or squabbles over Riksbank policy, but EMs have been more sensitive to specifics and independent factors, like Fitch downgrading Mexico to put the Peso under pressure and looming Chinese data keeping the Yuan in check after firmer PBoC Usd/Cny midpoint fix and rhetoric signalling more policy easing, including further targeted RRR cuts.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO:&nbsp;</strong>Asia was mixed overnight, though European bourses are higher, led by tech after TSM's numbers buoyed the sector. The positive trend has followed through to the US with three major indices marginally higher. The dollar has retained its bid, gold is slightly above neutral. The Treasury curve is little changed, but the bias is towards a slightly steeper curve (overnight, 2-year yields fell below 20bps). Crude benchmarks are recovering slightly after the recent steep falls.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Sectors are mixed, energy and financials are lagging once again with the latter being weighed on by MS after an EPS and revenue miss. Health Care leading the pack buoyed by gains in ABT after its earnings, also an update from Baxter (BAX) who have seen a surge in demand for its medical devices. Technology also firmer with gains in semiconductors after solid TSM figures.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Morgan Stanley (MS) earnings missed expectations although its sales and trading revenues were solid, particularly FICC which came in at 2.2bln much firmer than expectations. Blackrock (BLK) beat on EPS and revenue although AUM missed, BLK also raised dividend. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) saw solid EPS &amp; revenue beats while it only had 169mln in credit provisions. Elsewhere, Abbott ABT) beat on EPS, revenue was in-line. It suspended FY guidance but say Worldwide Medical Device sales +1.4% and FreeStyle Libre worldwide sales +49.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) saw a solid report.</p><p><strong>STOCK NEWS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) is to boost its wearables business by launching over-ear headphones. Costco (COST) raised its quarterly dividend to USD 0.70/shr. Gilead Sciences (GILD) (Health Care/Biotechnology) is reportedly in talks to purchase a significant stake in Arcus Biosciences (RCUS). Baxter International (BAX) is seeing a surge of demand for its good. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is reportedly retooling its website to sell fewer items as it deals with a surge of order volumes, according to WSJ citing sources. Starboard withdrew their director candidates to eBay’s (EBAY) board. Ford (F) China sales -34.9% Y/Y, although it gained 2.2% market share. <strong>CRUDE:&nbsp;</strong>There is talk this morning that US producers are facing little other option than to cut production given the recent demand hit and hefty inventory builds, along with yesterday's report that the US might pay producers to keep crude in the ground. From an equity trader's perspective, the weakness in crude after such a significant supply cut deal highlights just how dire the lack of demand is, and provides reasons for equity traders to remain cautious.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CORONAVIRUS:&nbsp;</strong>President Trump stated that the US may have passed the peak of new cases, and will deliver remarks today talking about reopening the economy. However, for equities, the virus may not be the main focus. JPM notes the trend of virus data has been constructive for about two weeks now, and it now seems that equity traders are paying attention to data (grim) and corporate earnings (weaker), and it is \"an active concern\", which JPM says may signal that the stock market rally seen April may be a bit \"long in the tooth\". Back to the virus data, as we have noted recently, desks are now looking for evidence that cases and death tolls are sustainably moving lower (they have certainly given that impression thus far), there is progress on vaccine development (timeframe is of course more medium/long-term on this), there is progress re-opening economies and re-starting economic activity, there is little 'second wave' of infections as economies re-open, and additionally, what 'shape' the recovery takes (v-shape is being increasingly questioned by some officials).</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Morgan Stanley (MS) earnings missed expectations although its sales and trading revenues were solid, particularly FICC which came in at 2.2bln much firmer than expectations.

CTA:&nbsp;</strong>Nomura's quant desk notes that after yesterday's weak US data (retail and Empire Fed), most global macro hedge funds still favoured a cautious approach, premised on there being a double-dip in global equities. However, most CTAs (a proxy for algo traders) remain buyers. \"CTAs specifically are coming up on a point at which the pace of their buying of US equity futures looks likely to slacken, and with global macro hedge funds seemingly trying to pull the market down with their selling, the balance between the two opposing forces looks likely to break down,\" Nomura says, adding \"We think one key issue is where the NASDAQ 100 stands as of 22 April or so, specifically whether it manages to stay above the line at around 8,100 that we estimate represents the average entry point for CTAs’ buying of futures since the beginning of April.\" Its quants think that even if macro funds were to step up their selling of equities with the aim of capturing the second half of the double-dip they seem to be expecting, CTAs may simply pause and then go back to building longs, provided that the NASDAQ 100 does not drop below 8,100.</p>",

        "subject": "PRIMER: US initial jobless claims due at 0830 ET/1330 BST; 5.1mln expected in the week",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>The Street looks for initial jobless claims to print 5.105mln (the range, once again, is extremely wide at 1.4mln to 8mln) in the week ending 11th April, from last week’s 6.61mln. Continuing claims are seen at 13.5mln from last week’s 7.46mln.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>UNEMPLOYMENT: </strong>\"Google searches for 'file for unemployment' are now falling consistently on a W/W basis, by about one third, if that trend continues, we’d expect headline claims next week to drop to about 4.5M,\" writes Pantheon Macroeconomics. The consultancy explains that this implies excess claims between the March and April payroll survey weeks will total some 20.1mln. \"The hit to payrolls should be a bit less than that, because the gap between the surveys this time is five weeks rather than four, but even after allowing for this, we reckon May payrolls will be reported falling by about 19mln, driving the unemployment rate to 16% if none of the newly-unemployed leave the labor force.\" Pantheon says that seems unlikely, given that the labor force reportedly dropped by 1.6mln in March, when household employment fell by 3.0mln. \"If that proportion repeats in April, headline unemployment will be about 10%, matching the peak after the Great Recession, but the true rate will be much higher, and it will rise further, along with the published rate, over the next few months.\"</li><li><strong>CUMULATIVE:</strong> Morgan Stanley notes that the magnitude of the increase in weekly claims has likely moved passed its peak, but the cumulative number is still rising, and will likely be in the range of 25mln over the next few weeks (the cumulative number over the last three weeks of data is 16.7mln). The trend rate pre-COVID was about 220k per week.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>MARKET REACTION:</strong> In terms of the price reaction, SocGen said the two previous releases of weekly claims “did not knock investors out of their stride and spark a flattening bid in bonds,” so while the data may serve to remind traders of the magnitude of the situation, it will unlikely drive a significant downside price reaction similar to that seen after yesterday's retail sales/Empire Fed data. Additionally, Deutsche Bank reminds us that over the last three weeks, on days the initial jobless claims data has been released, the S&amp;P 500 has actually rallied (6.2%, 2.3% and 3.4%).</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/40312db4-6e0c-4f27-ab22-807ad3f660bf.jpg\"></figure>",

News-flow has been light thus far, although the price action seems to be more consolidation from yesterday’s moves. Late yesterday, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, and Greece extended their short-selling ban on stocks to May 18th (originally set to expire in the coming days), albeit the respective bouses do not see significantly disproportionate price action vs. the region. Sectors are mostly in the green (ex-energy) but do not reflect a clear risk-tone. The IT sector outperforms as chip names see tailwinds from strong TSMC earnings, after the world’s largest contract chipmaker’s Q1 profit almost doubled on chip demand; albeit, H2 revenue is seen “flattish or may decline slightly”, the group also maintained its Capex guidance. Thus, the likes of STMicroelectronics (+3.0%), Infineon (+2.7%) and Dialog Semiconductor (+4.1%) remain underpinned. The sector breakdown sees Travel &amp; Leisure towards the top of the pack amid tailwinds from easyJet’s (+3.0%) trading update in which it announced further steps to strengthen liquidity, which will be sufficient for a lengthy period of fleet grounding. Other individual movers include EDF (-5.9%) as shares feel the brunt of demand potentially falling to 20% of normal levels amid the virus outbreak.</p><p><strong>BlackRock Inc (BLK)</strong> Q1 20 (USD): EPS USD 6.60 (exp. 6.16/6.20), Revenue 3.71 (exp. 3.6bln); AUM 6.47trln (exp. 6.59trln)</p><p><strong>Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK)</strong> Q1 20 (USD): EPS 1.05 (exp. 0.90), Revenue 4.11bln (exp. 3.85bln); 169mln credit provisions; AUM -2% at 1.8trln</p><p><strong>TSCM (2330 TT)</strong> reported Q1 net income TWD 116.99bln vs. Exp.

The Kiwi is trying to hold above 0.5945 lows and Aussie reclaim 0.6300 vs 0.6266 or so at one stage as Aud/Nzd straddles 1.0550 ahead of key Chinese releases early on Friday, headlined by Q1 GDP, but also including March ip and retail sales.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/GBP/CHF - </strong>All weaker against the Greenback as the DXY remains elevated within a 99.615-100.000 range, but with the Yen off worst levels and perhaps cushioned by decent option expiry interest at the 108.00 strike (1.8 bn) even though Japan is reportedly on the brink of extending its partial state of emergency from 7 prefectures to the whole country through to May 6. Similarly, the Euro could derive traction from multi-billion expiries under 1.0900 (1.0840-50 in 1.5bn, 1.0875 in 1.5bn, 1.0880-85 in 1.1bn) having derived very little if any support from not quite as bad as forecast Eurozone ip or ECB’s Schnabel ramming home the message that more conventional easing is counterproductive. However, the single currency did get some transitory momentum from Eur/Gbp cross flows as the pair bounced towards 0.8730 and Cable tripped some stops at 1.2460 awaiting official confirmation that UK lockdown will be prolonged until May 7 at least. Elsewhere, the Franc is still mixed just above 0.9700, but edging closer to 1.0500 vs the Euro following deeper Swiss producer and import price deflation (in y/y terms).</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK - </strong>Relative G10 outperformers as some buoyancy in oil prices underpins the Loonie and Norwegian Crown after the former extended post-BoC losses, while the Swedish Krona has shrugged off softer Prospera money market inflation expectations and Riksbank-Riksdag wrangling over policy mandates amidst a modest upturn in broad risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Although crude markets seem calmer to the benefit of the Rub, no such comfort for the Mxn in wake of Fitch downgrading Mexico to BBB from BBB-, as the Peso languishes under 24.4000 vs the Buck and not far from earlier April lows.</p><p><strong>Australian Employment (Mar) 5.9k vs. Exp. -40.0k (Prev. 26.7k).

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Given the rebound in EU equities, Eurozone periphery paper adding to recovery gains and stability in oil, <strong>Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries</strong> are all displaying degrees of resilience pending the return of NA participants and the next weekly instalment of initial claims that will likely grab the bulk of attention and headline space amidst a raft of releases all at 13.30BST. The respective 10 year bonds are at 172.40 vs 172.04 at worst, 136.82 from 136.69 at the opening low and 139-04+ within 139-07+ to 138.30+ overnight session parameters. For the record, more solid demand for DMO issuance and strong French auctions vs more mixed, incomplete Spanish results, but UK debt and STIRs may glean some independent impetus from a speech on point by BoE’s Tenreyro at 14.30BST as she orates on policy during pandemics.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Choppy trade in the complex as <strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front-month futures nursed earlier losses and extend on gains throughout the European session thus far, with the former initially faring slightly better than the latter heading into the OPEC+ monthly oil market report, albeit this has now reversed and the difference between the contracts widens. WTI potentially saw some support from reports that the US will be paying drillers to leave the oil in the ground amid the supply glut. Traders will now be eyeing the report for the group’s 2020 outlook, especially after producers hammered out a deal over the weekend. For reference, IEA predicts 2020 global oil demand to slump 9.3mln BPD whilst EIA downgraded its forecast by 5.6mln BPD. IEA report also stated that no feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near-term demand losses, so it will be interesting to see OPEC’s take on the market balance. WTI trades on either side of USD 20/bbl after printing an ~18yr base yesterday at USD 19.20/bbl. Brent prices meanwhile gain ground above 28/bbl with its respective YTD base around USD 21.70/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> is back on a firmer footing and remains comfortably above USD 1700/oz. Some note that the rally in the yellow metal has been underpinned by significant inflows into ETFs. Spot gold sees its recent high at 1747.75/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile, mirrors the gains in stocks, albeit price action in the red metal remains muted/contained. Finally, aluminium prices continued to rise with desks citing rising expectations of supply cuts driving the market alongside modest improvement in the Chinese markets.</p><p>Texas oil regulators are to meet April 21st to further discuss production limits.

News-flow has been light thus far, although the price action seems to be more consolidation from yesterday’s moves. Late yesterday, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, and Greece extended their short-selling ban on stocks to May 18th (originally set to expire in the coming days), albeit the respective bouses do not see significantly disproportionate price action vs. the region. Sectors are mostly in the green (ex-energy) but do not reflect a clear risk-tone. The IT sector outperforms as chip names see tailwinds from strong TSMC earnings, after the world’s largest contract chipmaker’s Q1 profit almost doubled on chip demand; albeit, H2 revenue is seen “flattish or may decline slightly”, the group also maintained its Capex guidance. Thus, the likes of STMicroelectronics (+3.0%), Infineon (+2.7%) and Dialog Semiconductor (+4.1%) remain underpinned. The sector breakdown sees Travel &amp; Leisure towards the top of the pack amid tailwinds from easyJet’s (+3.0%) trading update in which it announced further steps to strengthen liquidity, which will be sufficient for a lengthy period of fleet grounding. Other individual movers include EDF (-5.9%) as shares feel the brunt of demand potentially falling to 20% of normal levels amid the virus outbreak.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>NZD/AUD - The Antipodean Dollars have both extended losses vs their US rival in wake of comments from RBNZ Governor Orr overnight reiterating that negative interest rates remain an option along with direct financing in response to the coronavirus, while a considerably better than expected Australian employment report was swiftly dismissed due to the early data reference period that preceded the closure of non-essential businesses due to COVID-19. The Kiwi is trying to hold above 0.5945 lows and Aussie reclaim 0.6300 vs 0.6266 or so at one stage as Aud/Nzd straddles 1.0550 ahead of key Chinese releases early on Friday, headlined by Q1 GDP, but also including March ip and retail sales.</p><p>JPY/EUR/GBP/CHF - All weaker against the Greenback as the DXY remains elevated within a 99.615-100.000 range, but with the Yen off worst levels and perhaps cushioned by decent option expiry interest at the 108.00 strike (1.8 bn) even though Japan is reportedly on the brink of extending its partial state of emergency from 7 prefectures to the whole country through to May 6. Similarly, the Euro could derive traction from multi-billion expiries under 1.0900 (1.0840-50 in 1.5bn, 1.0875 in 1.5bn, 1.0880-85 in 1.1bn) having derived very little if any support from not quite as bad as forecast Eurozone ip or ECB’s Schnabel ramming home the message that more conventional easing is counterproductive. However, the single currency did get some transitory momentum from Eur/Gbp cross flows as the pair bounced towards 0.8730 and Cable tripped some stops at 1.2460 awaiting official confirmation that UK lockdown will be prolonged until May 7 at least. Elsewhere, the Franc is still mixed just above 0.9700, but edging closer to 1.0500 vs the Euro following deeper Swiss producer and import price deflation (in y/y terms).</p><p>CAD/NOK/SEK- Relative G10 outperformers as some buoyancy in oil prices underpins the Loonie and Norwegian Crown after the former extended post-BoC losses, while the Swedish Krona has shrugged off softer Prospera money market inflation expectations and Riksbank-Riksdag wrangling over policy mandates amidst a modest upturn in broad risk sentiment.</p><p>EM - Although crude markets seem calmer to the benefit of the Rub, no such comfort for the Mxn in wake of Fitch downgrading Mexico to BBB from BBB-, as the Peso languishes under 24.4000 vs the Buck and not far from earlier April lows.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Given the rebound in EU equities, <strong>Eurozone</strong> periphery paper adding to recovery gains and stability in oil, <strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> are all displaying degrees of resilience pending the return of NA participants and the next weekly instalment of initial claims that will likely grab the bulk of attention and headline space amidst a raft of releases all at 13.30BST. The respective 10 year bonds are at 172.40 vs 172.04 at worst, 136.82 from 136.69 at the opening low and 139-04+ within 139-07+ to 138.30+ overnight session parameters. For the record, more solid demand for DMO issuance and strong French auctions vs more mixed, incomplete Spanish results, but <strong>UK</strong> <strong>debt</strong> and STIRs may glean some independent impetus from a speech on point by BoE’s Tenreyro at 14.30BST as she orates on policy during pandemics.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Choppy trade in the complex as <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures nursed earlier losses and extend on gains throughout the European session thus far, with the former initially faring slightly better than the latter heading into the OPEC+ monthly oil market report, albeit this has now reversed and the difference between the contracts widens. <strong>WTI</strong> potentially saw some support from reports that the US will be paying drillers to leave the oil in the ground amid the supply glut. Traders will now be eyeing the report for the group’s 2020 outlook, especially after producers hammered out a deal over the weekend. For reference, IEA predicts 2020 global oil demand to slump 9.3mln BPD whilst EIA downgraded its forecast by 5.6mln BPD. IEA report also stated that no feasible agreement could cut supply by enough to offset near-term demand losses, so it will be interesting to see OPEC’s take on the market balance. <strong>WTI</strong> trades on either side of USD 20/bbl after printing an ~18yr base yesterday at USD 19.20/bbl. Brent prices meanwhile gain ground above 28/bbl with its respective YTD base around USD 21.70/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> is back on a firmer footing and remains comfortably above USD 1700/oz. Some note that the rally in the yellow metal has been underpinned by significant inflows into ETFs. <strong>Spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> sees its recent high at 1747.75/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile, mirrors the gains in stocks, albeit price action in the red metal remains muted/contained. Finally, <strong>aluminium</strong> prices continued to rise with desks citing rising expectations of supply cuts driving the market alongside modest improvement in the Chinese markets.</p>",

(-0.2%)</strong> traded subdued as sentiment in Hong Kong was dampened amid the weakening economic climate with Hong Kong Financial Secretary Chan suggesting the government will likely downgrade its outlook, although losses in the mainland were limited as markets await tomorrow’s slew of tier 1 Chinese data including Q1 GDP which People’s Daily noted will remain positive despite the current expectations for a contraction of 6.5% Y/Y. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the weakness seen across stocks and with prices underpinned following firmer demand at the enhanced liquidity auction in the long to super-long end.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> remained firmer as focus shifts to today’s US jobless claims data and the announcement of new guidelines on reopening the economy. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> were subdued by the resurgence of the greenback and slipped below the 1.0900 and 1.2500 handles respectively, with the latter also hampered as First Secretary of State Raab is expected to formally announce a lockdown extension following today’s Cobra meeting. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> breached through a cluster of hourly moving average levels&nbsp; including the 100-Hour MA of 107.76 fuelled by the USD-strength, although <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses lagged due to the risk-averse tone, while antipodeans were pressured with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> retreating from the 0.6000 handle after RBNZ Governor Orr stated the Bank has not ruled out negative rates. <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> initially gained from the better than expected jobs data, although this was retraced shortly after as the data reference period was for March 1st-14th, while closures of non-essential businesses took effect March 23rd.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were uneventful overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures fluctuating around the USD 20/bbl level as prices remained subdued by the ongoing demand concerns from the coronavirus fallout and following the recent IEA Monthly Report and record DoE crude build. Furthermore, this week’s Texas oil regulators meeting failed to result in any proposals being tabled after over 10 hours of hearing testimonies, although they are set to meet next week for further discussions. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were flat as price action continues to consolidate above the USD 1700/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> was kept rangebound by the lacklustre risk tone and as regional participants look ahead to tomorrow’s Chinese GDP data.</p><p>US tariffs on crude imports are still being considered, after the global oil deal according to US energy diplomat Fannon, while there were also reports that US is said to consider a plan to reduce production by paying drillers not to produce according to sources.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury complex bull-flattened markedly on Wednesday as risk appetite soured. The bid gained traction overnight as European trade commenced. In essence, equity futures were reversing the prior day’s strength and a dump in crude futures (a gloomy IEA report and chunky inventory builds) kept the macro narrative defensive. Then as the heavy US data slate got underway, which was dire across all accounts with “worst-ever/since” headlines bombarding screens, Treasury strength continued, although how much of the move was reactionary to the data remains a point for debate as many are looking past near-term prints. One desk noted that real money had been booking profits and selling into the Fed’s Treasury purchases, which were accompanied by hefty offer-to-cover ratios, stalling the move lower in yields in the afternoon; at the same time, the desk noted that specs and CTAs were taking the other side of the trade. USD issuance was afoot on Wednesday, likely keeping a cap on Treasury strength, where participants digested a USD 7bln three-parter from Saudi Arabia (5s, 10s, 40s), as well as lumpy, post-earnings USD 10bln launched from JPMorgan (6s, 11s, 21s, 31s). By settlement, curve spreads had flattened, with 2s -2bps at 0.20%, 10s -11bps at 0.64%, and 30s -14bps at 1.27%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 30 ticks higher at 139-05.</p><p><strong>Fed's Beige Book stated economic activity contracted sharply and abruptly across all regions in the US as a result of COVID-19 and that most districts reported declines in manufacturing but cited significant variation across industries</strong>. Furthermore, it noted that employment declined in all districts and steeply in many cases as the COVID-19 pandemic affected firms in many sectors, with many districts noting severe job cuts were widespread.

ASX 200 (-1.3%) is dragged by broad weakness across its sectors aside from some resilient patches among defensives and with corporate updates also providing a catalyst for individual stock moves, while Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) is dampened as coronavirus-related disruptions and shutdown extensions hampers Tokyo blue-chip manufacturers. Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are subdued with sentiment in Hong Kong downbeat amid the weakening economic climate with Hong Kong Financial Secretary Chan suggesting the government will likely downgrade its outlook, although losses in the mainland were limited as markets await tomorrow’s slew of tier 1 Chinese data including Q1 GDP which People’s Daily noted will remain positive, despite the current expectations for a contraction of 6.5% Y/Y.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer regardless of the recent poor data releases in which Industrial Production, Retail Sales and NY Fed Manufacturing all printed wider than expected contractions, while focus now shifts to today’s US jobless claims data and the announcement of new guidelines on reopening the economy. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are subdued by the resurgence of the greenback and have slipped below the 1.0900 and 1.2500 handles respectively, with the latter also hampered as First Secretary of State Raab is expected to formally announce a lockdown extension following today’s Cobra meeting. Elsewhere, USD/JPY breached through a cluster of hourly moving average levels including the 100-Hour MA of 107.76 fuelled by the USD-strength although JPY-crosses lagged due to the risk-averse tone, while antipodeans were pressured with NZD/USD retreating from the 0.6000 handle after RBNZ Governor Orr stated they have not ruled out negative rates. AUD/USD initially gained from the better than expected jobs data, although this was retraced shortly after as ABS noted the data was prior to the main actions to curb the spread of COVID-19 as the data reference period was for March 1st-14th while closures of non-essential businesses took effect March 23rd.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher but with gains limited as it takes a breather from the prior day’s surge and with participants awaiting the enhanced liquidity auction in the long to super-long end.</p>",
