(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Apple (AAPL) initially traded in the green following an upgrade at Jefferies; the tech behemoth also likely benefitting from a Digi Times article stating its iPhone 11 demand has exceeded expectations in Taiwan. Gains were pared back as it followed Tuesday’s general cautious market tone. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) an outperformer following an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. CarMax (KMX) initially were an outperformer, however, gains reversed as it tracked the overall risk-off tone. The semiconductor index (SOX) initially opened higher also, coinciding with some positive research from RBC, which suggested both NAND and DRAM pricing has bottomed, and are showing signs of a rebound; however it also became susceptible to the overall risk tone and drifted lower throughout the session. AMD (AMD) were under pressure as initial reports suggest it delayed its Ryzen 9 3950 X launch, however AMD announced that it is focusing on meeting strong demand for its Ryzen processes and that it is planning to launch both AMD Ryzen 9 3950 X and 3rd generation threadripper processer family in volume from November. Social media names (FB, TWTR) came under scrutiny again from US President Trump who announced social media companies are weakening the democratic rule. Consumer names (TGT, M, WMT) all hit by poor consumer confidence data, and housing names (LEN, PHM, TOL) firmer following mixed housing data, Case Shiller missed expectations and slowed from the prior however FHFA was firmer, beating expectations. Tesla (TSLA) was pressured as its rival, Nio (NIO) fell 25% after it posted a quarterly drop in sales, citing a cut in subsidies and weak demand for the decline. S&amp;P 500 -0.8% AT 2967, NASDAQ-100 -1.4% AT 7710, DOW JONES&nbsp; -0.5% AT 26812.</p><p>The curve was mixed, at settlement; although yields are lower across the curve, 2s5s, 2s10s and 2s30s spreads are slightly narrower, while 5s10s, 5s30s and 10s30s were modestly wider. Today’s bid was inspired by weak consumer confidence data, while the slide in risk assets also contributed (weak consumer confidence out of the US follows weak Eurozone PMI data; Trump stuck to the script at the UN, but revealed no signs of thawing on China or Iran, while the NY Fed’s repo operations – both the 14-day and the overnight operation – were oversubscribed, hinting that liquidity conditions in money markets might not be a temporary phenomenon, and possibly reflects some other underlying tensions other than the temporary factors cited last week (last week, the crunch in money markets was attributed to corporate tax paying and digesting Treasury issuance). The Treasury’s sale of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through the screens by 1bps. Cover was above recent averages, and the bidder breakdown was also encouraging, seeing primary dealers participation lower, and indirect bidder participation above recent averages. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 20+ higher ticks at 130-23.</p>",

The probability of a Trump impeachment is now around 46% according to betting markets, falling from 66% earlier, as Trump announced he will release transcripts of his call with Ukrainian President Zelensky. Additionally, it seems the PBOC is talking down stimulus measures. Havens like Treasuries, JPY, XAU have found bids, while equities have seen downside. However, the ‘risk-off’ signal is not universal, with a lot of EMFX higher, along with antipodes. Crude, meanwhile, is softer ahead of API inventories, with demand-side factors being cited for the weakness.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRUMP IMPEACHMENT: </strong>A majority of Democrats are now in favour of impeaching US President Trump, and desks note that the implied probability of a Trump impeachment was as high as 66% today, as derived from betting markets; however once US President Trump announced he would release the transcript of his phone call to Ukrainian President Zelensky, the implied probability fell to 46%. The phone call has been one of the Democrat’s main reasons to call for an impeachment, as a whistle-blower complained about the call. US House Speaker Pelosi is expected to announce aftermarket a formal inquiry into the whistle-blower complaint. Currently, 165 Democrats and 1 independent lawmakers are said to be backing impeachment, Axios reported, with 218 require; the total was 80 in June. Markets have taken the news with caution, with traders noting the uncertainties and increasingly anti-business position of Democrats behind the risk-off, while Democrats are yet unlikely to have read the transcript itself.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP UN SPEECH: </strong>US President Trump largely stuck to the script in his UN speech, reiterating known stances. He believes a deal can be made with China, though said the US was seeking ’justice’ for intellectual property theft. Trump also suggested the US was monitoring events in Hong Kong, which will likely irritate China (although Trump has still not bought up the Uighur issue in public remarks, something which sources had suggest he might). On Japan, he said that they are looking to finalise a deal before Wednesday. Trump had firm words for Iran, and sanctions would not be lifted. They will be tightened as long as Iran continues its ‘menacing’ behaviour. Elsewhere, his usual calls for other nations to up defence spending, and his anti-immigrant stance were on show. The market digested Trump’s comments with a risk-off feel – while everything he said was largely known, he did not adopt a conciliatory tone on either trade or Iran.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Missed expectations, falling to 125.1 against expectations of 133.5; although the headline is still consistent with solid consumption growth, the details were soft, indicating that trade tensions could be filtering into the consumer sector. The sub-indices were weak, with present conditions falling (169 vs 176) as well as expectations falling (95.8 from 106.4), while the differential between jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get fell, auguring poorly for next week’s employment situation report. Inflation expectations also eased slightly to 4.8% from 4.9%. Analysts noted that the weakness mirrors that seen in the University of Michigan’s gauge of consumer confidence, hinting that the pace of consumer spending seen of late will struggle to be sustained, with indicators pointing to slower growth ahead. In its most recent statement, the FOMC upgraded its assessment of household spending, however, today’s consumer confidence data challenges the Fed’s thesis somewhat, and could signal further ate cuts ahead.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>China has reportedly granted new waivers to several domestic state and private firms which exempts them from retaliatory tariffs on soybeans imported from the US, sources said. The waivers apply to between 2-3mln tonnes of US soybeans; on Monday, reports had suggested that some Chinese companies had bought at least 20 cargoes of US soybeans, or around 1.2mln tonnes.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> After recent RRR cuts, a PBOC statement judged that interest rates were now appropriate, and the central bank has ample policy tools. Governor Yi Gang said the central bank was not in a rush to add stimulus, will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance, and will keep debt levels sustainable. While inflationary pressures remain moderate, Yi said the central bank would be patient, stating \"we are not in a rush to roll out massive rate cuts or QE like some other central banks.\" Some desks have noted that the tone of Financial News, the PBOC's official outlet, has become more hawkish relative to the recent State Council meeting. UBS notes that while China definitely wants to support economic growth, policymakers are cautious on current re-leveraging and reheating of the property sector, and UBS therefore argues that the PBOC is now slightly reluctant to conduct another aggressive RRR cut this year, as policymakers attempt to strike a balance between a growing domestic economy and pushing forward necessary reforms, such as deleveraging and cooling the real estate market. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Liu Kun said policymakers will continue to adjust policies on tax cuts and fee cuts, based on assessments, and aims to allocate all local government bond proceeds to projects by the end of October.</p><p><strong>* US/JAPAN:</strong> The US and Japan may fall short of signing a trade deal this week, NY Times reported, as negotiators grapple with how to resolve US President Trump's threat to place tariffs on cars from Japan; last year, car imports made up around one-third of US' Japanese imports. There were hopes that a trade deal would be signed between the two nations at this week's UN meetings, but instead, the two sides may issue a joint statement, and keep working toward completing an agreement in the coming weeks. Trump has seen the tariffs as leverage in negotiations, though it is also becoming an obstacle to reaching a deal, sources said; Japan has been seeking a commitment from the US not to tariff Japanese cars, and is pushing to include a 'sunset clause' in the trade deal that would cause the deal, as well as any benefits it has delivered to US agricultural producers, to expire if US follows through on threats to impose auto tariffs on Japan.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN SEPTEMBER IFO:</strong> Although headline business climate rose above expectations (94.6 vs expected 94.4 and prior 94.3), the details still shows the challenges faced by the German economy. Expectations fell to 90.8 from 91.3, mitigating the optimism of the headline. There was a fall in the manufacturing component, though services rebounded (in contrast to Markit's PMI data) Pantheon Macroeconomics said, although added that it has to be careful fitting stories to the data, it appears that the ECB’s recently announced measures have succeeded in providing a modest lift to the current assessment, while expectations are still hampered by unchanged, and elevated, global uncertainty.</p><p><strong>* ECB: ECB's de Guindos</strong> said the ECB is facing a more protracted economic slowdown than was previously expected (echoing Draghi on Monday), but said there was very little evidence of this priced in by markets. Alluding to liquidity squeezes, the Vice President said that if money market transactions were to occur at higher rates than previously, there could be some upward pressure on certain rates.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK Supreme Court has on Tuesday judged that PM Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, in a blow to Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Bercow subsequentially announced he would recall Parliament first thing on Wednesday at 11:30 BST, where there will be opportunity for emergency debate applications under SO24 (essentially providing MPs the opportunity to take control of the order paper and therefore the running order of Parliament); however, it is not yet clear on how the Parliamentary proceedings will develop, or how the government intends to proceed. Capital Economics said the decision increases the chances of a delay to Brexit and reduces the chances of a “no deal”. CapEco says there are three ways in which this could influence Brexit: 1) MPs will have more time to try and tighten up the legislation that would force the Prime Minister to delay Brexit to 31st January. 2) It presumably reduces the ability of the government to suspend Parliament again, either before 31st October, or ahead of any further Brexit deadline, thereby allowing Parliament more leeway to prevent a no deal. 3) Johnson could resign as Prime Minister which, again, would reduce the chances of a no deal (although the PM has said he would not). Capital Economics says that, as it stands, the best way for the PM to meet his pledge to leave the EU on 31st October is with a deal, but it notes that two hurdles lie in his way: agreeing a deal with the EU, and then getting it passed through Parliament; the consultancy says that both look very challenging.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Kashkari (dove, non-voter) said he pushed for a larger rate cut at the September FOMC; says job market has slowed markedly.</p><p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> Governor Kuroda said the BOJ was yet undecided on adding more stimulus at its October meeting, adding that the bank was seeking ways to make its yield curve control policy more sustainable, and warned that if the current low-interest rate environment is prolonged further, it will become necessary to pay closer attention to the cost of the BOJ's policies, arguing that any easing would aim to push short- and medium-term rates, without hitting longer-dated yields. Kuroda also reiterated that the central bank stands ready to boost stimulus if the economy risks losing momentum which could impact its price goal, and in determining whether further action is required, the BOJ will examine whether demand is exceeding supply, how keen companies are in raising prices and wages, as well as the evolution of inflation expectations. Deutsche Bank's analysts said that, against the backdrop of the BOJ adding dovish language after the past two meetings (July’s \"won’t hesitate\", September’s \"will re-examine developments\") Kuroda’s speech reads a touch hawkish, signalling that he is in no rush to ease, while he also sounded more upbeat on inflation than the market's path.</p><p><strong>* RBA:</strong> Ahead of next week's policy meeting, RBA Governor Lowe reiterated that he would consider QE in some circumstances but still thinks it is unlikely, Lowe also cited recent evidence which has shown that the economy can sustain lower rates of unemployment and underemployment than previously thought likely. He noted that fundamental factors underpinning the longer-term outlook for the Australian economy remained strong, and the economy has reached a gentle turning point (something he has said recently). The RBA's Board was prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, and make further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time. Looking ahead, Lowe said that inflation was expected to pick up, but will likely remain below the midpoint of the target range for some time. Lowe also noted that the flexibility of labour supply meant that strong rates of employment growth can be sustained without inflation becoming a problem - both positive developments, Lowe said Australia benefits from having both a flexible exchange rate and a flexible labour market, taking comfort in the economy's strong fundamentals. After Lowe's comments, markets continue to price a rate cut next week with 60% certainty (versus around 80% at the end of last week).</p><p><strong>* RBNZ PREVIEW:</strong> The RBNZ will announce its latest rate decision on Wednesday in which the central bank is expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.00% with a Reuters poll showing unanimous forecasts for the RBNZ to pause on rates, while markets are pricing in a 69% probability for no change in the OCR and 31% chance for a 25bps cut.

It could also be indicative that the market is, for now, buying the Saudi line that production will be normalised by next week. Brent prices settled at USD 60.22 on the Friday before Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attacked, rising to a peak of USD 71.95 on the Monday that followed. With Brent prices now falling back to a 63-handle; PVM is surprised that fears of further attacks/retaliations have been subdued, though geopolitical tensions remain elevated with US troops heading to the Middle East, while any diplomatic resolution between US/Iran seems far off. Elsewhere, Russia Energy Minister Novak says the Saudis have not asked Russia to raise oil production; says Russia has capacity to raise oil output by 0.5mln BPD in the short-term.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 20+ HIGHER TICKS AT 130-23. </strong>The curve was mixed, at settlement; although yields are lower across the curve, 2s5s, 2s10s and 2s30s spreads are slightly narrower, while 5s10s, 5s30s and 10s30s were modestly wider. Today’s bid was inspired by weak consumer confidence data, while the slide in risk assets also contributed (weak consumer confidence out of the US follows weak Eurozone PMI data; Trump stuck to the script at the UN, but revealed no signs of thawing on China or Iran, while the NY Fed’s repo operations – both the 14-day and the overnight operation – were oversubscribed, hinting that liquidity conditions in money markets might not be a temporary phenomenon, and possibly reflects some other underlying tensions other than the temporary factors cited last week (last week, the crunch in money markets was attributed to corporate tax paying and digesting Treasury issuance). The Treasury’s sale of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through the screens by 1bps. Cover was above recent averages, and the bidder breakdown was also encouraging, seeing primary dealers participation lower, and indirect bidder participation above recent averages.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> From a relative-value perspective, the 5-year part of the curve lacks clear set-up ahead of Wednesday's auction, SocGen says, noting that it trades rich in asset swap versus older 5s, though it is cheap on the fly versus 2s and 10s. Last cycles' auction series saw decent internals, despite the selling at the lowest high-yield since October 2016. SocGen has argued that low dealer holdings in the 3-6 year sector should support demand at this week's auction, adding that the current WI is cheap relative to previous outright stop-out rates; the bank says it is positive on the 5s auction.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.8% AT 2967, NASDAQ-100 -1.4% AT 7710, DOW JONES&nbsp; -0.5% AT 26812; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -1.2%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.3%, Energy&nbsp; -1.6%, Financials&nbsp; -0.9%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.9%, Industrials&nbsp; -0.6%, Information Technology&nbsp; -1%, Materials&nbsp; -1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -1.3%, Utilities&nbsp; 1.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) initially traded in the green following an upgrade at Jefferies; the tech behemoth also likely benefitting from a Digi Times article stating its iPhone 11 demand has exceeded expectations in Taiwan. Gains were pared back as it followed Tuesday’s general cautious market tone. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) an outperformer following an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. CarMax (KMX) initially were an outperformer, however, gains reversed as it tracked the overall risk-off tone. The semiconductor index (SOX) initially opened higher also, coinciding with some positive research from RBC, which suggested both NAND and DRAM pricing has bottomed, and are showing signs of a rebound; however it also became susceptible to the overall risk tone and drifted lower throughout the session. AMD (AMD) were under pressure as initial reports suggest it delayed its Ryzen 9 3950 X launch, however AMD announced that it is focusing on meeting strong demand for its Ryzen processes and that it is planning to launch both AMD Ryzen 9 3950 X and 3rd generation threadripper processer family in volume from November. Social media names (FB, TWTR) came under scrutiny again from US President Trump who announced social media companies are weakening the democratic rule. Consumer names (TGT, M, WMT) all hit by poor consumer confidence data, and housing names (LEN, PHM, TOL) firmer following mixed housing data, Case Shiller missed expectations and slowed from the prior however FHFA was firmer, beating expectations. Tesla (TSLA) was pressured as its rival, Nio (NIO) fell 25% after it posted a quarterly drop in sales, citing a cut in subsidies and weak demand for the decline.</p><p><strong>* NIKE (NKE) Earnings PRIMER: </strong>Nike (NKE) are releasing their Q1 earnings report (June-Aug 31st quarter) tonight at 16:15 ET / 21:15 BST where it is expected to report an EPS of USD 0.70 and a revenue of USD 10.41bln. Expectations for FY EPS are USD 2.90 and FY revenue expected at USD 42.18bln. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/nike-nke-earnings-primer-expected-to-report-an-eps-of-usd-0-70-and-a-revenue-of-10-41bln-expectations-for-fy-eps-are-2-90-and-fy-revenue-expected-at-42-18bln-24-09-2019\">Click here for full analysis</a></p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>An oversubscribed overnight and 14-day repo operations and weak consumer confidence put the buck under pressure, allowing EUR to trade up. Havens JPY, CHF and XAU benefited from the cautious tone of trading, though other FX more associated with risk-on conditions (AUD, NZD, and EMFX) were firmer; however, BRL was lower as the pension vote in the senate is once again delayed. The pound was up after SCOTUK ruled against PM Johnson’s prorogation, a friendly outcome for pro-Remainers.</p>",

US House Speaker Pelosi is expected to announce aftermarket a formal inquiry into the whistle-blower complaint. Currently, 165 Democrats and 1 independent lawmakers are said to be backing impeachment, Axios reported, with 218 require; the total was 80 in June. Markets have taken the news with caution, with traders noting the uncertainties and increasingly anti-business position of Democrats behind the risk-off, while Democrats are yet unlikely to have read the transcript itself.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP UN SPEECH: </strong>US President Trump largely stuck to the script in his UN speech, reiterating known stances. He believes a deal can be made with China, though said the US was seeking ’justice’ for intellectual property theft. Trump also suggested the US was monitoring events in Hong Kong, which will likely irritate China (although Trump has still not bought up the Uighur issue in public remarks, something which sources had suggest he might). On Japan, he said that they are looking to finalise a deal before Wednesday. Trump had firm words for Iran, and sanctions would not be lifted. They will be tightened as long as Iran continues its ‘menacing’ behaviour. Elsewhere, his usual calls for other nations to up defence spending, and his anti-immigrant stance were on show. The market digested Trump’s comments with a risk-off feel – while everything he said was largely known, he did not adopt a conciliatory tone on either trade or Iran.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Missed expectations, falling to 125.1 against expectations of 133.5; although the headline is still consistent with solid consumption growth, the details were soft, indicating that trade tensions could be filtering into the consumer sector. The sub-indices were weak, with present conditions falling (169 vs 176) as well as expectations falling (95.8 from 106.4), while the differential between jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get fell, auguring poorly for next week’s employment situation report. Inflation expectations also eased slightly to 4.8% from 4.9%. Analysts noted that the weakness mirrors that seen in the University of Michigan’s gauge of consumer confidence, hinting that the pace of consumer spending seen of late will struggle to be sustained, with indicators pointing to slower growth ahead. In its most recent statement, the FOMC upgraded its assessment of household spending, however, today’s consumer confidence data challenges the Fed’s thesis somewhat, and could signal further ate cuts ahead.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>China has reportedly granted new waivers to several domestic state and private firms which exempts them from retaliatory tariffs on soybeans imported from the US, sources said. The waivers apply to between 2-3mln tonnes of US soybeans; on Monday, reports had suggested that some Chinese companies had bought at least 20 cargoes of US soybeans, or around 1.2mln tonnes.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> After recent RRR cuts, a PBOC statement judged that interest rates were now appropriate, and the central bank has ample policy tools. Governor Yi Gang said the central bank was not in a rush to add stimulus, will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance, and will keep debt levels sustainable. While inflationary pressures remain moderate, Yi said the central bank would be patient, stating \"we are not in a rush to roll out massive rate cuts or QE like some other central banks.\" Some desks have noted that the tone of Financial News, the PBOC's official outlet, has become more hawkish relative to the recent State Council meeting. UBS notes that while China definitely wants to support economic growth, policymakers are cautious on current re-leveraging and reheating of the property sector, and UBS therefore argues that the PBOC is now slightly reluctant to conduct another aggressive RRR cut this year, as policymakers attempt to strike a balance between a growing domestic economy and pushing forward necessary reforms, such as deleveraging and cooling the real estate market. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Liu Kun said policymakers will continue to adjust policies on tax cuts and fee cuts, based on assessments, and aims to allocate all local government bond proceeds to projects by the end of October.</p><p><strong>* US/JAPAN:</strong> The US and Japan may fall short of signing a trade deal this week, NY Times reported, as negotiators grapple with how to resolve US President Trump's threat to place tariffs on cars from Japan; last year, car imports made up around one-third of US' Japanese imports. There were hopes that a trade deal would be signed between the two nations at this week's UN meetings, but instead, the two sides may issue a joint statement, and keep working toward completing an agreement in the coming weeks. Trump has seen the tariffs as leverage in negotiations, though it is also becoming an obstacle to reaching a deal, sources said; Japan has been seeking a commitment from the US not to tariff Japanese cars, and is pushing to include a 'sunset clause' in the trade deal that would cause the deal, as well as any benefits it has delivered to US agricultural producers, to expire if US follows through on threats to impose auto tariffs on Japan.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN SEPTEMBER IFO:</strong> Although headline business climate rose above expectations (94.6 vs expected 94.4 and prior 94.3), the details still shows the challenges faced by the German economy. Expectations fell to 90.8 from 91.3, mitigating the optimism of the headline. There was a fall in the manufacturing component, though services rebounded (in contrast to Markit's PMI data) Pantheon Macroeconomics said, although added that it has to be careful fitting stories to the data, it appears that the ECB’s recently announced measures have succeeded in providing a modest lift to the current assessment, while expectations are still hampered by unchanged, and elevated, global uncertainty.</p><p><strong>* ECB: ECB's de Guindos</strong> said the ECB is facing a more protracted economic slowdown than was previously expected (echoing Draghi on Monday), but said there was very little evidence of this priced in by markets. Alluding to liquidity squeezes, the Vice President said that if money market transactions were to occur at higher rates than previously, there could be some upward pressure on certain rates.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK Supreme Court has on Tuesday judged that PM Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, in a blow to Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Bercow subsequentially announced he would recall Parliament first thing on Wednesday at 11:30 BST, where there will be opportunity for emergency debate applications under SO24 (essentially providing MPs the opportunity to take control of the order paper and therefore the running order of Parliament); however, it is not yet clear on how the Parliamentary proceedings will develop, or how the government intends to proceed. Capital Economics said the decision increases the chances of a delay to Brexit and reduces the chances of a “no deal”. CapEco says there are three ways in which this could influence Brexit: 1) MPs will have more time to try and tighten up the legislation that would force the Prime Minister to delay Brexit to 31st January. 2) It presumably reduces the ability of the government to suspend Parliament again, either before 31st October, or ahead of any further Brexit deadline, thereby allowing Parliament more leeway to prevent a no deal. 3) Johnson could resign as Prime Minister which, again, would reduce the chances of a no deal (although the PM has said he would not). Capital Economics says that, as it stands, the best way for the PM to meet his pledge to leave the EU on 31st October is with a deal, but it notes that two hurdles lie in his way: agreeing a deal with the EU, and then getting it passed through Parliament; the consultancy says that both look very challenging.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Kashkari (dove, non-voter) said he pushed for a larger rate cut at the September FOMC; says job market has slowed markedly.</p><p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> Governor Kuroda said the BOJ was yet undecided on adding more stimulus at its October meeting, adding that the bank was seeking ways to make its yield curve control policy more sustainable, and warned that if the current low-interest rate environment is prolonged further, it will become necessary to pay closer attention to the cost of the BOJ's policies, arguing that any easing would aim to push short- and medium-term rates, without hitting longer-dated yields. Kuroda also reiterated that the central bank stands ready to boost stimulus if the economy risks losing momentum which could impact its price goal, and in determining whether further action is required, the BOJ will examine whether demand is exceeding supply, how keen companies are in raising prices and wages, as well as the evolution of inflation expectations. Deutsche Bank's analysts said that, against the backdrop of the BOJ adding dovish language after the past two meetings (July’s \"won’t hesitate\", September’s \"will re-examine developments\") Kuroda’s speech reads a touch hawkish, signalling that he is in no rush to ease, while he also sounded more upbeat on inflation than the market's path.</p><p><strong>* RBA:</strong> Ahead of next week's policy meeting, RBA Governor Lowe reiterated that he would consider QE in some circumstances but still thinks it is unlikely, Lowe also cited recent evidence which has shown that the economy can sustain lower rates of unemployment and underemployment than previously thought likely. He noted that fundamental factors underpinning the longer-term outlook for the Australian economy remained strong, and the economy has reached a gentle turning point (something he has said recently). The RBA's Board was prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, and make further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time. Looking ahead, Lowe said that inflation was expected to pick up, but will likely remain below the midpoint of the target range for some time. Lowe also noted that the flexibility of labour supply meant that strong rates of employment growth can be sustained without inflation becoming a problem - both positive developments, Lowe said Australia benefits from having both a flexible exchange rate and a flexible labour market, taking comfort in the economy's strong fundamentals. After Lowe's comments, markets continue to price a rate cut next week with 60% certainty (versus around 80% at the end of last week).</p><p><strong>* RBNZ PREVIEW:</strong> The RBNZ will announce its latest rate decision on Wednesday in which the central bank is expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.00% with a Reuters poll showing unanimous forecasts for the RBNZ to pause on rates, while markets are pricing in a 69% probability for no change in the OCR and 31% chance for a 25bps cut.

It could also be indicative that the market is, for now, buying the Saudi line that production will be normalised by next week. Brent prices settled at USD 60.22 on the Friday before Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attacked, rising to a peak of USD 71.95 on the Monday that followed. With Brent prices now falling back to a 63-handle; PVM is surprised that fears of further attacks/retaliations have been subdued, though geopolitical tensions remain elevated with US troops heading to the Middle East, while any diplomatic resolution between US/Iran seems far off. Elsewhere, Russia Energy Minister Novak says the Saudis have not asked Russia to raise oil production; says Russia has capacity to raise oil output by 0.5mln BPD in the short-term.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 20+ HIGHER TICKS AT 130-23. </strong>The curve was mixed, at settlement; although yields are lower across the curve, 2s5s, 2s10s and 2s30s spreads are slightly narrower, while 5s10s, 5s30s and 10s30s were modestly wider. Today’s bid was inspired by weak consumer confidence data, while the slide in risk assets also contributed (weak consumer confidence out of the US follows weak Eurozone PMI data; Trump stuck to the script at the UN, but revealed no signs of thawing on China or Iran, while the NY Fed’s repo operations – both the 14-day and the overnight operation – were oversubscribed, hinting that liquidity conditions in money markets might not be a temporary phenomenon, and possibly reflects some other underlying tensions other than the temporary factors cited last week (last week, the crunch in money markets was attributed to corporate tax paying and digesting Treasury issuance). The Treasury’s sale of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through the screens by 1bps. Cover was above recent averages, and the bidder breakdown was also encouraging, seeing primary dealers participation lower, and indirect bidder participation above recent averages.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> From a relative-value perspective, the 5-year part of the curve lacks clear set-up ahead of Wednesday's auction, SocGen says, noting that it trades rich in asset swap versus older 5s, though it is cheap on the fly versus 2s and 10s. Last cycles' auction series saw decent internals, despite the selling at the lowest high-yield since October 2016. SocGen has argued that low dealer holdings in the 3-6 year sector should support demand at this week's auction, adding that the current WI is cheap relative to previous outright stop-out rates; the bank says it is positive on the 5s auction.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.8% AT 2967, NASDAQ-100 -1.4% AT 7710, DOW JONES&nbsp; -0.5% AT 26812; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -1.2%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.3%, Energy&nbsp; -1.6%, Financials&nbsp; -0.9%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.9%, Industrials&nbsp; -0.6%, Information Technology&nbsp; -1%, Materials&nbsp; -1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -1.3%, Utilities&nbsp; 1.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) initially traded in the green following an upgrade at Jefferies; the tech behemoth also likely benefitting from a Digi Times article stating its iPhone 11 demand has exceeded expectations in Taiwan. Gains were pared back as it followed Tuesday’s general cautious market tone. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) an outperformer following an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. CarMax (KMX) initially were an outperformer, however, gains reversed as it tracked the overall risk-off tone. The semiconductor index (SOX) initially opened higher also, coinciding with some positive research from RBC, which suggested both NAND and DRAM pricing has bottomed, and are showing signs of a rebound; however it also became susceptible to the overall risk tone and drifted lower throughout the session. AMD (AMD) were under pressure as initial reports suggest it delayed its Ryzen 9 3950 X launch, however AMD announced that it is focusing on meeting strong demand for its Ryzen processes and that it is planning to launch both AMD Ryzen 9 3950 X and 3rd generation threadripper processer family in volume from November. Social media names (FB, TWTR) came under scrutiny again from US President Trump who announced social media companies are weakening the democratic rule. Consumer names (TGT, M, WMT) all hit by poor consumer confidence data, and housing names (LEN, PHM, TOL) firmer following mixed housing data, Case Shiller missed expectations and slowed from the prior however FHFA was firmer, beating expectations. Tesla (TSLA) was pressured as its rival, Nio (NIO) fell 25% after it posted a quarterly drop in sales, citing a cut in subsidies and weak demand for the decline.</p><p><strong>* NIKE (NKE) Earnings PRIMER: </strong>Nike (NKE) are releasing their Q1 earnings report (June-Aug 31st quarter) tonight at 16:15 ET / 21:15 BST where it is expected to report an EPS of USD 0.70 and a revenue of USD 10.41bln. Expectations for FY EPS are USD 2.90 and FY revenue expected at USD 42.18bln. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/nike-nke-earnings-primer-expected-to-report-an-eps-of-usd-0-70-and-a-revenue-of-10-41bln-expectations-for-fy-eps-are-2-90-and-fy-revenue-expected-at-42-18bln-24-09-2019\">Click here for full analysis</a></p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>An oversubscribed overnight and 14-day repo operations and weak consumer confidence put the buck under pressure, allowing EUR to trade up. Havens JPY, CHF and XAU benefited from the cautious tone of trading, though other FX more associated with risk-on conditions (AUD, NZD, and EMFX) were firmer; however, BRL was lower as the pension vote in the senate is once again delayed. The pound was up after SCOTUK ruled against PM Johnson’s prorogation, a friendly outcome for pro-Remainers.</p>",

Brent prices settled at USD 60.22 on the Friday before Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attacked, rising to a peak of USD 71.95 on the Monday that followed. With Brent prices now falling back to a 63-handle; PVM is surprised that fears of further attacks/retaliations have been subdued, though geopolitical tensions remain elevated with US troops heading to the Middle East, while any diplomatic resolution between US/Iran seems far off. Elsewhere, Russia Energy Minister Novak says the Saudis have not asked Russia to raise oil production; says Russia has capacity to raise oil output by 0.5mln BPD in the short-term.&nbsp;</p>",

Further, disappointing US consumer confidence data only added fuel to the bearish fire and took the DXY down to sub-98.50 levels. DXY looks to end the EU session at near the bottom of 98.44-70 range.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling remains one of the G10 winner after the UK Supreme Court dealt a blow to UK PM Johnson after it ruled the decision as a court matter before announcing that the suspension was unlawful. Parliament will now convene at 1130 BST tomorrow, meanwhile ambiguity surrounds whether Labour Leader Corbyn will call a vote of no confidence this week amid mounting pressure, although a Labour spokesperson declined to comment. Aside from that, chances of a Brexit delay have seemingly increased with EU diplomats also admitting that an extension will take pressure off both sides to make compromises, as per BBC’s Adler, however, PM Johnson has noted that he will not abandon his attempt to take the UK out of the bloc on October 31st. Cable remains near intraday highs around its 21 WMA (1.2490) having earlier tested 1.2500 to the upside after trading within a 1.2415-2500 range. Meanwhile the Euro has reclaimed 1.1000 to the upside with aid from a weakening USD amid the aforementioned reasons after deriving little impetus from the Ifo measures which mostly topped estimates (ex-expectations), although the institute noted that the outlook for the coming months has deteriorated and the domestic economy is likely to shrink in Q3 and stagnate in Q4, a similar comment mate by IHS yesterday. EUR/USD is poised to end the EU session near intra-day highs within a 1.0985-1015 range.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has held onto a bulk of its Lowe-induced gains and is poised to close the EU session not far off the 0.6800 mark after the governor highlighted that fundamental factors underpinning the longer-term outlook for the Australian economy remain strong and economy has reached a gentle turning point, a comment made at the last speech which signals that the Central Bank could stand pat on at the next meeting on October 1st. AUD/USD remains near close to the top of today’s 0.6766-0.6805 ahead of resistance at 0.6810. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has derived strength ahead of tonight’s RBNZ Monetary Policy Decision with expectations with a Reuters poll showing unanimous forecasts for the RBNZ to pause on rates at 1.00% after over-delivering at the last meeting (full preview available in the RANsquawk research suite). As for the cross, AUD/NZD has receded further from the 1.08 level and resides around 1.0750 heading into the European close.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Marginally firmer on the back of a weaker Greenback and as the geopolitical landscape remains volatile as US President Trump refrained from de-escalating tensions, with Iran as sanctions will remain and tighten as long as Iran’s behaviour continues. USD/JPY is poised to the end the session around the 107.50 level having visited (thus far) an intra-day band of 107.40-80.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira staged another recovery with strength attributed to media reports that the US is said to make a new offer to Turkey regarding F-35s and Patriots system after the two Presidents’ phone call over the weekend. USD/TRY fell from an intraday high of 5.7208 to a current low of 5.6735 after breaching its 55 MDA at 5.6779 and ahead of its 50 DMA at 5.6705.</p>",

In terms of newsflow this morning saw the Ifo release which was a slightly mixed release and as such did not garner much of a response; comments around the release, while interesting, were largely in-line with yesterday’s IHS comments on the prospect of a Q3 stagnation. Elsewhere, UK debt is the main mover of the day on the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful and as such is void, on this ruling Gilts dropped to a low of 133.12 (-60 ticks) before pairing back most of the move and in fact surpassing pre-announcement levels, as the next steps are very unclear. Following the ruling House of Commons speaker Bercow has stated that the House should convene immediately, and other political parties are capitalising on the opportunity to call for Johnson’s resignation. Looking ahead the session for Gilts will likely remain dominated by the parliamentary back-and-forth, though BoE’s Carney is due to speak late doors for the European session.

He has also added that the US has lots of pressure on Iran, which does follow from the instigation of sanctions on the Iranian Bank by the US; as such, focus today will be on the remarks from Trump and if there is any reference to further sanctions or the prospect of more forceful action. In terms of scheduling proceedings at the UN are to formally begin at around 13:00BST with President Trump scheduled to arrive at the UN headquarters around 14:30BST. Elsewhere, focus turns to tonight’s API release where expectations are form a 0.6mln/bbl draw; though, ING note that the result may surprise market expectations due to the number of storm related refinery disruptions that have occurred recently. In terms of metals, <strong>Gold</strong> is little changed hovering around the USD 1520/oz mark within a tight USD 1.0/oz range for the session; ahead of risk factors including the UNGA and a number of Central Bank speakers. Separately, <strong>copper </strong>prices are overall little changed, retaining their non-committal tone from the Asia-Pac session; though the metal does remain comfortably above the USD 2.62/lb mark.</p>",

Core European debt is softer this morning, though not excessively so with the Bund trading with a 30 tick range vs. yesterdays +100 tick range. In terms of newsflow this morning saw the Ifo release which was a slightly mixed release and as such did not garner much of a response; comments around the release, while interesting, were largely in-line with yesterday’s IHS comments on the prospect of a Q3 stagnation. Elsewhere, UK debt is the main mover of the day on the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful and as such is void, on this ruling Gilts dropped to a low of 133.12 (-60 ticks) before pairing back most of the move and in fact surpassing pre-announcement levels, as the next steps are very unclear. Following the ruling House of Commons speaker Bercow has stated that the House should convene immediately, and other political parties are capitalising on the opportunity to call for Johnson’s resignation. Looking ahead the session for Gilts will likely remain dominated by the parliamentary back-and-forth, though BoE’s Carney is due to speak late doors for the European session. Stateside, focus will be on the UNGA and Trump’s comments, particularly those pertaining to Iran. Elsewhere, a relatively quiet US session with a few data prints scheduled and the first of this weeks’ supply in the form of USD 40bln 2-year auction.</p>",

If the government wins this step, then the prorogation of parliament will continue as planned until October 14th. If the Supreme Court deems that it is within their powers to intervene, the next question they will decide upon is whether or not UK PM Johnson acted unlawfully in his prorogation of parliament. Again, should the decision at this stage go the governments way, nothing changes. If the government loses, Johnson could be forced to recall parliament, which could then remain in session as if it had never been prorogued, although some reports suggesting it would be down to the speakers of both houses (Lords and Commons) to decide how to proceed. Depending on the court’s reasoning for making the decision, the ruling might open the possibility of a further prorogation of Parliament in a different, lawful way (note: over the weekend UK Foreign Minister Raab refused to rule out the possibility that parliament could be prorogued again).</p><p><strong>What are the implications for Brexit?</strong> Parliament have already approved the Benn Bill, which obliges the PM to request an extension to Article 50 should the Prime Minister not have secured a deal with the EU by the end of the EC Summit (17-18 Oct), so in some senses, the heavy lifting has already been done. However, with Parliament back in session, an anti-hard Brexit majority could continue to push further anti-no deal legislation, making it more difficult for Boris Johnson to fulfil his “do or die” pledge.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Normally Parliament does not sit anyway at this time of the year, as the major parties hold their annual conferences. It is unclear how a resumption of the parliamentary session would coincide with the Conservative Party Conference, which will be held on Monday the 30th of September.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat mixed following an indecisive close on Wall St where the major indices spent the day steadily recouping from the opening losses brought on by weak Eurozone PMI data. ASX 200 (Unch.) is choppy as outperformance in gold stocks and resilience in financials are counterbalanced by losses across the broader market, while Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) remains afloat on return from the extended weekend but with gains capped by a choppy currency and as officials scramble to finalize a US-Japan trade deal amid uncertainty regarding auto tariffs. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are positive after continued PBoC liquidity efforts and as the central bank suggested there was still ample monetary policy tools, although advances are limited by the trade-related overhang as participants digest the recent ebbs and flows of the US-China trade saga ahead of next month’s high level talks.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is marginally higher following the prior day’s gains which was on the back of weakness in EUR/USD as the single currency slipped below 1.1000 following disappointing French, German and Eurozone PMI data, which missed expectations across the board and showed the worst reading for Germany in a decade with the bloc’s largest economy already on the brink of a recession. GBP/USD is also lacklustre amid a continued lack of progress in Brexit discussions as the UK remained adamant it cannot accept a Northern Ireland only backstop and with EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier equally opposed to the UK’s proposals. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is indecisive amid a similar risk tone across the region and antipodeans also trade choppy as initial downside in AUD/USD was later faded following a firmer than expected CNY reference rate, with participants looking ahead to RBA Governor Lowe’s speech later where there are expectations he could signal a rate cut for next week’s meeting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher on return from the holiday closure amid the recent temperamental US-China trade headlines and indecisive risk tone in the region, while the BoJ are also present in the market today for JPY 810bln of JGBs in the belly to the short-end.</p>",
