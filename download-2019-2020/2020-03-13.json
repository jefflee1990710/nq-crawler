Coordinated / uncoordinated fiscal and monetary responses to the COVID-19 outbreak continue to grow, where Trump declared a state of emergency to free up funds, the BoC and Canadian Government announced a rate cut and fiscal stimulus, Norges Bank made an emergency rate cut, and several other central banks announced liquidity measures, all on Friday. Investors with longer-term horizons are looking for entry points to deploy their cash, with debate on whether stocks are cheap yet or not, albeit oversold. Additionally, shorter term “speculators” are unlikely to be wanting risk exposure over the weekend. Furthermore, with many central banks having laid out their cards, participants are increasingly tying their economic expectations to the support of fiscal authorities. The equity gains were widespread with all sectors in positive territory, Financials leading as yields rose across the curve in a bear steepening fashion; Utilities were a relative underperformer, as was Energy following crude prices coming off their highs on Russia announcing production ramp-up plans – note Trump announcing the SPR would be purchasing a large amount of oil, gave a post-settlement spike higher for oil prices and the Energy sector. Meanwhile, The NY Fed carried out over half of its monthly Treasury purchases schedule on Friday in efforts to provide liquidity to the complex, which upon announcement, saw a short-lived bid; it announced further adjustments to its purchases would be made.</p><p><strong>* US FISCAL STIMULUS: </strong>In a press conference,<strong> </strong>US President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus, in fitting with earlier source reports, opening up to USD 50bln from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEAM) for states and localities to fight against the virus. Trump announced that he will be waiving interest payments on all federal government loans, including student loans. The Health Secretary Azar announced the administration will be able to waive certain license requirements for health care providers; asking hospitals to activate emergency preparedness plans. It was also announced 500k additional tests will be available next week, thanking Roche (ROGN SW) for its work. Earlier on, the<strong> </strong>Trump administration said it would not sign off on a COVID-19 stimulus relief package that the House had approved as it reportedly contained measures that it deemed not related relief of the virus. Elsewhere, USTR has granted additional tariff exclusions on medical products from China; although Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US is not currently looking at tariff rollbacks outside of specific exemptions.</p><p><strong>* BOC &amp; FISCAL COORDINATION: </strong>Cut its key overnight interest rate by 50bps in an emergency announcement, adding it stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if it is required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target. Governor Poloz announced the BoC has a variety of other tools in the tool kit to address the crisis (last night it announced it will temporarily add new 6 and 12-month term repo operations bi-weekly from March 17th). Poloz did reiterate that negative rates are in the toolkit, although he does not like them and said it is very unlikely to be needed given the fiscal firepower Canada has. Last week the BoC cut rates by 50bps, more or less in line with market pricing while maintaining an easing bias and that it stood ready to act if appropriate. The previous meeting took place before the Saudi v Russia oil pricing war, thus the fall in oil prices also had a play in Friday’s emergency cut. On the fiscal package, set to be unveiled next week, Poloz said it will be a co-ordinated one. Canadian Finance Minister also accompanied Poloz in the meeting where he stated Canada is ready to take extraordinary measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak and that it will establish a credit support programme to provide additional CAD 10bln to businesses and stimulate the economy, noting it will do whatever it takes to keep Canadians safe and the economy strong, and that Canada has the best balance sheet in the G7 and plenty of fiscal room. When asked about a recession, he stated currently there is too much uncertainty and that Canada will be unveiling its package next week, dodging a question about the size. The Chief Financial Superintendent was also present, where he announced Canada is lowering its domestic stability buffer requirement for major banks to 1.25% from 2.5% of risk-weighted assets to add an additional CAD 300bln in lending capacity. The announcement initially saw a bout of weakness in the CAD given the rate cut, although the stimulus package set to be announced next week, plus with the measures announced today saw a reversal and CAD regained some strength, although the moves were limited and well within the day’s trading ranges.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN FISCAL MEASURES:</strong> The Canadian Government are reportedly considering a multi-billion aid package for industries which have most been hit by the outbreak; PM Trudeau later said a “significant” stimulus package would be announced in the coming days. Furthermore, Canada is working closely with the US on border control due.</p><p><strong>* NY FED: </strong>The Desk announced, and purchased, USD 33bln of Treasuries on Friday across the entire curve. The purchases were a shift forward of the curve-wide, month-ahead USD 60bln of purchases (excluding USD 20bln of reinvestments) schedule released on Thursday. The Desk noted the purchases were “to address temporary disruptions in the market for Treasury securities” - Friday saw continued poor liquidity for off-the-run Treasury securities with bid/ask spreads remaining wide – and announced its intensions to further bring forward the month-ahead purchases schedule and adjust the terms of its operations to “foster smooth Treasury market functioning and efficient and effective policy implementation.” Meanwhile, the o/n, one-month and three-month repo operations were all comfortably undersubscribed, in what on the surface indicates calmness in the funding market, although some draw attention to some of the underlying issues of banks’ balance sheets being constrained by post-2008 crisis regulatory requirements, which could be holding back potential participants from tapping the NY Fed’s offerings. Note that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that US banks should feel free to draw from the Fed’s discount window (a facility which has held a stigma since the crises). Furthermore, sources reported the Fed is encouraging banks to use liquidity buffers to keep lending to companies, as well as holding talks with banks about potential leniency if lenders breach key liquidity buffer thresholds.</p><p><strong>* EU COMMISSION:</strong> President von der Leyen announced the EU is to set up EUR 37bln in its coronavirus response initiative. Additionally, the Commission will provide maximum flexibility on state aid to provide flexibility within the stability and growth pact; encouraging member states to take all necessary measures. Von der Leyen said the Commission stands ready to do more as the situation evolves. Vestager said the EU will put in place a compensation scheme for tourism, hotel and transport sectors; EU to enable governments to ensure banks have adequate liquidity if need be. EU officials also said that EU/EZ growth will very likely drop below 0% this year.</p><p><strong>* EUROPEAN STATE RESPONSES: </strong>France said the G7 leaders are to hold a video conference on Monday in order to discuss the co-ordinated response to the virus, adding that US President Trump is also reportedly on board with the measures; France called for further coordination within Europe.<strong> </strong>Swiss Government is to make up to CHF 10bln available to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus; schools to close until at least April 4th, tightened restriction on public gatherings/events. Italy could spend up to EUR 16bln on the first stimulus move, according to La Stampa; this was previously touted at EUR 12bln.<strong> </strong>Belgium PM Wilmes said the Government is to close all bars, restaurants, sports events and schools due until April 3rd, while public transport will continue to run although companies are encouraged to allow staff to work from home. Spanish PM Sanchez says that Spain is to declare a state of emergency as of March 14th. Portugal is to shut all schools nationwide beginning on Monday and will re-evaluate on April 9th.</p><p><strong>* APAC FISCAL/MONETARY RESPONSES: </strong>Monetary authorities are monitoring whether the market panic morphs into a 2008-style credit crunch. The BOJ overnight injected JPY 1.5trln of two-week loans, and said next week it would provide ample liquidity via market operations; while the RBA injected A$8.8bln, more than double the usual daily amount, and also extra three-month liquidity, something it only does on occasion. PBOC announced it is to cut the RRR for some banks by 50-100bps and an additional 100bps for joint-stock banks from March 16th, unleashing CNY 550bln. The central bank actions were to meet short-term liquidity demands from banks, and followed similar moves announced by the Fed on Thursday. Meanwhile, South Korea finance minister and the BOK agreed to cooperate on policy – BOK said it was discussing the need to hold an emergency policy rate review meeting - while Bank Indonesia is acting to ease liquidity pressures too.</p><p><strong>* SHORT SALE BANS: </strong>UK FCA has temporarily banned short selling in certain instruments and transactions. Italian market regulator introduced temporary short-selling ban on some stocks on Friday, adds short-selling ban applies to 85 stocks and strengthens ban on naked short-selling. Spain market regulator banned short selling of 69 Spanish stocks. South Korea banned stock short selling for 6-months, according to Yonhap.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 UPDATE: </strong>US COVID-19 cases rose to 1629 from 1215; 41 deaths (prev. 36). UK cases rose to 798 from 590. Italy death toll rose to 1266 from 1016; cases rose to 17,660 from 15,113. France cases rose to 3661 from 2876; death toll rose to 79 from 61. Spain cases rose to 4209 from 3004; death toll up to 120 from 84. Dutch cases rose to 804 from 614. WHO’s Tedros said Europe has now become the epicentre of the virus spread.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's <strong>Villeroy</strong> said we see market volatility but are guided by economic conditions, ECB's package is coherent for the current economic state; are making unlimited liquidity available to banks so they can lend. Villeroy added the ECB can distance itself from the capital key in order to buy more of some countries debt if this is necessary; will propose to France's Financial Stability Council that their counter-cyclical capital buffers are released. <strong>Lane</strong> said the GC retains the option of future cuts in the policy rate if warranted and temporary fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows both across asset classes and across countries in response to the \"flight to safety\". <strong>De Cos</strong> said Lagarde’s comments about spreads were misunderstood; does not rule out rate cuts if situation worsens, but decision not to cut yesterday was right; says APP could include corporate and sovereign bonds. <strong>Visco</strong> said ECB policy will be adjusted across time and jurisdictions to ensure proper transmission; first response to crisis is the role of governments, if needed there will be more action and more words. Visco noted the widening of spreads making policy transmission more difficult; can front load bond purchases if necessary.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 1 POINT 3 TICKS LOWER AT 135-25+. </strong>The TPLEX bear steepened again on Friday amid a renewed risk appetite. The Treasury selling coincided with strength in equities, following on from Thursday where both were sold amid a flight to cash. It is possible that the move in government debt was less correlated to risk appetite and more to technical factors, such as the ongoing duration selling by risk parity-type players, as well as profit taking from exhausted levels, as has broadly been suggested in recent sessions. The TPLEX did find a bid after the NY Fed stepped into move forward its Treasury purchase schedule, although it ultimately proved short-lived, as the selling pressures resumed heading into settlement. The 10-year yield rose by around 9bps to just over 0.94%, while the 2-year yield remained unchanged at 0.48%.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 0.23 HIGHER AT USD 31.73/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 0.63 HIGHER AT USD 33.85/BBL: </strong>Crude futures made gains on Friday, albeit off their highs, as participants digested an appetite rebound and an expected Russian supply ramp up. The benchmarks were bid overnight, alongside equities, as traders found some reprieve after the dismal Thursday session, as well as mounting economic stimulus. Although as US participants came to the scene they were greeted with comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak, cited by IFAX, stating that Moscow sees no grounds to return to discussions with OPEC+ partners, reiterating that Russia could raise output in April by 200k BPD. Novak’s comments, although not new, further remove hopes/doubts that the oil major would not follow through with production hikes, and nods to the ongoing price war. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia are to supply additional oil volumes in April to all clients in Europe who ask for this, according to sources. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs said it continues to expect Brent to underperform WTI as US export incentive will need to shut, while it estimates global demand lost is near 4.5mln BPD. The latest US Baker Hughes rig count printed Oil +1 at 683, Natural Gas -2 at 107, and Total -1 at 792 rigs.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Multiple Kata’ib Hezbollah positions in Iraq were targeted by heavy US airstrikes, officials confirmed, noting the attacks as retaliation for the recent strikes on Camp Taji, where several personnel were killed, including two Americans. The US Centre of Command (CENTCOM) said the attacks were self-defence, where weapons facilities were destroyed; adding that two aircraft carriers continued to operate in the area after the strike. Furthermore, CENTCOM said it was moving Patriot missiles into Iraq, although they would not be ready for a few days. Elsewhere, the US State Dept. has summoned China's ambassador over comments from China's foreign ministry spokesman, that stated the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +9.21% at 2709, NDX +10% at 7995, DJIA +9.34% at 23181. <strong>Sectors:</strong> Financials +12.7%, Tech +12%, Telecoms +9.2%, Comms +8.75%, Energy +8.6%, Staples +8.4%, Industrials +7.8%, Health +7.00%, Materials +6.9%, Discretionary +6.1%, Utilities +5.6%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Cruise liners &amp; Airlines bounced after the heavy sell off Thursday with cruise names; NCLH, CCL, RCL, seeing heavy gains at the open, although pared back somewhat throughout the day, barring the late session, Trump-induced ramp. Meanwhile airlines, AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, saw solid gains. Oracle (ORCL) saw solid gains after its earnings beat on top and bottom line, while it increased its share repurchase programme by USD 15bln and provided decent guidance. Adobe (ADBE) also much firmer amid broader risk sentiment and solid earnings. Meanwhile on the flipside, Broadcom (AVGO) failing to benefit from risk appetite after weak earnings, Tapestry (TPR) initially saw downside after a downgrade at Deutsche Bank, although quickly reversed course and saw gains of over 4%. Elsewhere, Cincinnati Bell (CBB) is to be acquired by Macquarie Infrastructure Partners for USD 15.50/shr in a USD 2.9bln transaction.</p><p><strong>* NORGES: </strong>Rates were cut by the Norges bank in an emergency meeting by 50bp to 1.0%; alongside which, the Finance Ministry cut the countercyclical capital buffer to 1.0% from 2.5%. Within the accompanying remarks it is stressed that further policy action can be taken if this is deemed necessary. Scheduling wise, the regular meeting was supposed to occur on March 18th; however, due to this week’s emergency action the decision has been taken to cancel this meeting and as such their next rate-setting gathering will be on May 7th. Notably, this announcement was accompanied by emphasis that they can meet on short notice to determine new policy measures if this is required; as such, participants cannot rule out the prospect of further action before then.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK: </strong>Riksbank announced it is prepared to take further measures and to supply necessary liquidity even between meetings; will take up to SEK 500bln to safeguard credit supply. To make the facility attractive to the banks, the loans will be granted at a variable interest rate equivalent to the Riksbank's repo rate, at present 0 per cent, and they will have a maturity of 2 years. Governor Ingves said the Bank can undertake currency intervention and rate cuts if it thinks they are a suitable measure; cannot say in detail what they would do if they needed to take further action. Ingves said the Bank is ready to take further measures needed, where all measures in the toolbox are available; can give liquidity support to banks and can purchases bonds. Ingves added that fiscal policy room is large in Sweden.</p><p><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP: crude price wars and COVID-19 pandemic spark pandemonium.</strong></p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Dollar remains firmly on course to end the (EU) week as top dog, in stark contrast to this time last Friday when the Fed’s intermeeting ease exacerbated bull-flattening across the US Treasury curve. The DXY is nudging the top of another wide 98.760-94.632 band as recovery gains vs G10 counterparts far outweigh losses against others. In short, it has been an extremely volatile week as the breakdown in OPEC+ talks over an additional output reduction due to Russian defiance prompted Saudi Arabia to cut selling prices and ramp up production, with oil prices tumbling more than 30% at one stage on Monday. Russia then retaliated and despite talks between the 2 parties plus other cartel members/non-members, no resolution has been found to keep crude under pressure, albeit off worst levels. Meanwhile, nCoV has now evolved into a global pandemic in the eyes of the WHO and several countries aside from Italy are in full or part lockdown mode, with Spain reportedly on the brink of declaring a national state of emergency this weekend. In response, more Central Banks have followed the Fed’s lead and Governments untied purse-strings in a collective if not coordinated effort to counter the effects of the coronavirus. This has all helped the Greenback reclaim some lost ground, but with added momentum from a general cull of exposure to risk, high beta, cyclical and activity assets in favour of cash holdings amidst tightening liquidity, credit and funding conditions.</p><p><strong>* JPY/CHF: </strong>The Yen has literally gone from most wanted to least desired after tracking huge swings in sentiment and riding as high as 101.20 before reversing sharply to almost 107.50 at the other extreme. The BoJ has not been tempted to bring forward its March policy deliberations or verdict even though the Japanese Central Bank has been involved in at least one formal meeting with the MoF and Government. However, sources have repeatedly suggested that some form of stimulus is on the way, ranging from bigger JGB and ETF purchases, plus a new JGSS repo line to inject liquidity. Similarly, the SNB has kept its powder and declined to comment about the ECB’s targeted policy measures, but the Franc remains volatile within a 0.9555-0.9194 band and around 1.0600 vs the Euro anticipating something at the quarterly policy review if only a reinforcement of the need to maintain NIRP and intervening (regardless of US manipulation claims) rather than a rate cut and upgrade to the Chf’s assessment from highly valued at present.</p><p><strong>* GBP/EUR/NOK: </strong>Wednesday was billed as UK budget and to a lesser extent data day, but the BoE arguably stole the show with a pre-Liffe open ½ point rate cut and subsequent presser stressing that this was part of a concerted/joint strategy to combat the COVID-19 contagion. New UK Chancellor duly followed up with an expansive mix of fiscal policies, including Gbp30 bn for direct anti-virus initiatives, but the Pound failed to glean much impetus in the same vein as the Euro that arguably had more to gain from the ECB confounding market expectations that were geared towards a 10 bp depo cut at least. Instead, the Bank unveiled ‘surgical’ tools to provide a bridge until the June TLTRO 3 tranche in the form of a new LTRO, and both at more favourable rates, while introducing a Eur120 bn APP envelope until the end of 2020 that can be utilised to offset FTQ episodes via fluctuations in distributions across assets and member states, temporarily. Conversely, the Norwegian Crown did derive some much needed traction from the Norges Bank early 50 bp rate cut, rendering next Thursday’s official meet redundant and therefore cancelled, allied to some stabilisation in oil prices, but now before hitting new all-time lows vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>* SEK/CAD/NZD/AUD:</strong> All more subject to broad sentiment and related moves in the US Dollar, commodities etc rather than independent or specific factors, although the Swedish Krona was hampered by a rebound in unemployment and relatively restrained Riksbank actions to protect the economy and financial system from nCoV. Elsewhere, the Loonie is now threatening to breach 1.4000 as the virus spreads through Canada and with significant measures that were slated to be aired by Canadian PM Trudeau today no deferred for a few days. The Kiwi is in danger of losing 0.6000 status awaiting the RBNZ to see what it has in store to combat the pandemic, but the omens do not look good given that the Aussie has been overwhelmed by all the coronavirus concerns irrespective of the RBA’s 25 bp ease, hefty liquidity provision and the Government’s even more generous fiscal contribution.</p><p><strong>* EM: </strong>Difficult to know where to start, but in short it has been a traumatic week for regional currencies, including the Yuan despite increasing evidence that China could well have weathered the worst of the health outbreak, in terms of social and human cost if not the full brunt of the economic damage. Moreover, the PBoC pre-announced another RRR cut on a sliding scale of 50-100 bp stretching to 200% for joint stock banks. Meanwhile, the Rouble has been tracking Brent and the Mexican Peso also contingent on crude, as the Rand kept tabs on Eskom’s power performance intermittently and the Real on BCB interventions to curb depreciation along with many other monetary authorities striving to stop runs turning into complete capital flights.</p>",

The benchmarks were bid overnight, alongside equities, as traders found some reprieve after the dismal Thursday session, as well as mounting economic stimulus. Although as US participants came to the scene they were greeted with comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak, cited by IFAX, stating that Moscow sees no grounds to return to discussions with OPEC+ partners, reiterating that Russia could raise output in April by 200k BPD. Novak’s comments, although not new, further remove hopes/doubts that the oil major would not follow through with production hikes, and nods to the ongoing price war. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia are to supply additional oil volumes in April to all clients in Europe who ask for this, according to sources. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs said it continues to expect Brent to underperform WTI as US export incentive will need to shut, while it estimates global demand lost is near 4.5mln BPD. The latest US Baker Hughes rig count printed Oil +1 at 683, Natural Gas -2 at 107, and Total -1 at 792 rigs.</li></ul>",

The BOC also maintained its easing bias, stating that it stood ready to adjust monetary policy further if required, while it dropped the reference in its January statement which stated policy was at an appropriate level. In its policy statement, the Bank said that while the economy had been operating close to potential, with inflation at target, the virus is a “material” negative shock (borrowing from other G7 central banker language) to the Canadian and global outlooks; business activity in some regions has fallen sharply and supply chains have been disrupted, reflective in CAD and commodities, the statement noted. The BOC also believes that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate further, which will depress activity. In light of all these developments, the central bank said that the outlook was clearly weaker now than it was in January.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: crude price wars and COVID-19 pandemic spark pandemonium",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains firmly on course to end the (EU) week as top dog, in stark contrast to this time last Friday when the Fed’s intermeeting ease exacerbated bull-flattening across the US Treasury curve. The <strong>DXY</strong> is nudging the top of another wide 98.760-94.632 band as recovery gains vs G10 counterparts far outweigh losses against others. In short, it has been an extremely volatile week as the breakdown in OPEC+ talks over an additional output reduction due to Russian defiance prompted Saudi Arabia to cut selling prices and ramp up production, with oil prices tumbling more than 30% at one stage on Monday. Russia then retaliated and despite talks between the 2 parties plus other cartel members/non-members, no resolution has been found to keep crude under pressure, albeit off worst levels. Meanwhile, nCoV has now evolved into a global pandemic in the eyes of the WHO and several countries aside from Italy are in full or part lockdown mode, with Spain reportedly on the brink of declaring a national state of emergency this weekend. In response, more Central Banks have followed the Fed’s lead and Governments untied purse-strings in a collective if not coordinated effort to counter the effects of the coronavirus. This has all helped the Greenback reclaim some lost ground, but with added momentum from a general cull of exposure to risk, high beta, cyclical and activity assets in favour of cash holdings amidst tightening liquidity, credit and funding conditions.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen has literally gone from most wanted to least desired after tracking huge swings in sentiment and riding as high as 101.20 before reversing sharply to almost 107.50 at the other extreme. The BoJ has not been tempted to bring forward its March policy deliberations or verdict even though the Japanese Central Bank has been involved in at least one formal meeting with the MoF and Government. However, sources have repeatedly suggested that some form of stimulus is on the way, ranging from bigger JGB and ETF purchases, plus a new JGSS repo line to inject liquidity. Similarly, the SNB has kept its powder and declined to comment about the ECB’s targeted policy measures, but the Franc remains volatile within a 0.9555-0.9194 band and around 1.0600 vs the Euro anticipating something at the quarterly policy review if only a reinforcement of the need to maintain NIRP and intervening (regardless of US manipulation claims) rather than a rate cut and upgrade to the Chf’s assessment from highly valued at present.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/NOK</strong></p><p>Wednesday was billed as UK budget and to a lesser extent data day, but the BoE arguably stole the show with a pre-Liffe open ½ point rate cut and subsequent presser stressing that this was part of a concerted/joint strategy to combat the COVID-19 contagion. New UK Chancellor duly followed up with an expansive mix of fiscal policies, including Gbp30 bn for direct anti-virus initiatives, but the Pound failed to glean much impetus in the same vein as the Euro that arguably had more to gain from the ECB confounding market expectations that were geared towards a 10 bp depo cut at least. Instead, the Bank unveiled ‘surgical’ tools to provide a bridge until the June TLTRO 3 tranche in the form of a new LTRO, and both at more favourable rates, while introducing a Eur120 bn APP envelope until the end of 2020 that can be utilised to offset FTQ episodes via fluctuations in distributions across assets and member states, temporarily. Conversely, the Norwegian Crown did derive some much needed traction from the Norges Bank early 50 bp rate cut, rendering next Thursday’s official meet redundant and therefore cancelled, allied to some stabilisation in oil prices, but now before hitting new all time lows vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>SEK/CAD/NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All more subject to broad sentiment and related moves in the US Dollar, commodities etc rather than independent or specific factors, although the Swedish Krona was hampered by a rebound in unemployment and relatively restrained Riksbank actions to protect the economy and financial system from nCoV. Elsewhere, the Loonie is now threatening to breach 1.4000 as the virus spreads through Canada and with significant measures that were slated to be aired by Canadian PM Trudeau today no deferred for a few days. The Kiwi is in danger of losing 0.6000 status awaiting the RBNZ to see what it has in store to combat the pandemic, but the omens do not look good given that the Aussie has been overwhelmed by all the coronavirus concerns irrespective of the RBA’s 25 bp ease, hefty liquidity provision and the Government’s even more generous fiscal contribution.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Difficult to know where to start, but in short it has been a traumatic week for regional currencies, including the Yuan despite increasing evidence that China could well have weathered the worst of the health outbreak, in terms of social and human cost if not the full brunt of the economic damage. Moreover, the PBoC pre-announced another RRR cut on a sliding scale of 50-100 bp stretching to 200% for joint stock banks. Meanwhile, the Rouble has been tracking Brent and the Mexican Peso also contingent on crude, as the Rand kept tabs on Eskom’s power performance intermittently and the Real on BCB interventions to curb depreciation along with many other monetary authorities striving to stop runs turning into complete capital flights.</p>",

Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 was cited as the main driving force behind the move with the MPC looking \"to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove sharp and large, but should be temporary\". In terms of other measures, the MPC refrained from expanding gilt or corporate purchases at this stage, potentially, leaning in favour of using them later down the line if required given that room to the downside is particularly limited for rates. Elsewhere, policymakers opted to offer a new term-funding scheme with additional incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises. The scheme will offer four-year funding over the next 12 months and be carried out at a rate at, or very close to the Bank rate. Additionally, the FPC cut the UK's counter-cyclical buffer to 0.0% vs. Prev. 1.0% (was due to reach 2.0% by December 2020) in a move that will release support of up to GBP 190bln to businesses. In terms of the fallout of the decision, the measures will have to be taken in the context of measures unveiled in today's budget.</li></ul>",

Investor sentiment took a hit from all angles including the lack of solid stimulus efforts so far from US and its ban on travel from the EU, while some countries, businesses and sporting events also announced shutdown measures. ASX 200 (+4.4%) was in panic mode at the open and was dragged lower by heavy losses in financials and the commodity-related sectors with gold miners the worst performers as the precious metal proved to be no hiding place for the ongoing bloodbath, although the index then rebounded as stock markets and US futures recovered from lows with some also attributing it to the <strong>RBA injecting AUD 8.8bln of funds through repos </strong>during the early morning chaos. Nikkei 225 (-6.1%) saw losses of over 1500 points and briefly slipped below the 17k level for the first time since 2016, before momentarily retracing the majority of the declines. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) conformed to the overnight disarray amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and as China’s industry ministry suggested the global coronavirus epidemic places uncertainty on China's work resumption, while stock markets in South Korea, India, Indonesia and Philippines all triggered circuit breakers earlier in the session but then recouped most the losses in which India briefly retraced the full 10% slump. Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the wide-spread risk aversion and off-schedule BoJ announcement to buy a total of JPY 700bln of JGBs, as prices extended on the prior day’s selling to test the 153.00 level where support eventually held.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Gains are relatively broad-based, albeit Italy’s FTSE MIB outperforms regional peers after reports that the Italian market regulator will introduce a temporary ban on short-selling on some stocks today – applying to 85 stocks. Furthermore, press reported that the country could spend up to EUR 16bln on the first stimulus move vs. prior UR 12bln– scheduled to be unveil later today. Sectors are all in the green, albeit off highs, with Energy outperforming amid the rebound in the complex, whilst Consumer Discretionary pulled back from its earlier outperformance as the Travel &amp; Leisure sector dipped back into negative territory. Individual movers largely reflect a consolidation of yesterday, although notorious copper miners BHP (+12.0%) and Rio Tinto (+11.0%) taking advantage of the price action in the red metal. Similarly, BP (+8.2%), Shell (+8.6%) and Total (+8.8%) benefit from the upside seen in the energy markets.

Eur/Nok reversed further from fresh all time highs above 11.4500 in response to sub-11.2000, as the Bank also shaved 150 bp off the counter-cyclical buffer for banks before rolling out new F-loans at the lower 1% benchmark rate. Conversely, Eur/Sek remains elevated within a 10.7740-9410 range following relatively limited anti-nCoV policy measures from the Riksbank in the form of a fresh credit line and pledge to provide more funding and QE if required, though Sweden’s FSA did slash the CCB to zero from 2.5%. Moreover, in subsequent pressers Norges Bank and Riksbank Governors both underlined that lower benchmark rates are an option if economic conditions worsen, and for the latter that could be warranted given another spike in jobless rates. Not to be completely outdone, the PBoC preannounced lower RRRs ranging from 50-100 bp, and as much as -200% for joint stock banks all to be rolled out from Monday, helping the Yuan recover from under 7.0000 and risk sentiment overall.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD -</strong> Although their US counterpart remains elevated in its own right (DXY pivoting 97.500), the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie are all benefiting from a broad revival in risk appetite and especially the former after the RBA supplemented fiscal support with a hefty liquidity boost that helped the ASX turn a whopping loss into a 4%+ gain by the close. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6300+ status and Nzd/Usd is close behind circa 0.6150, while the Loonie is also drawing impetus from the aforementioned bounce in oil to test resistance at 1.3800 vs lows near 1.3950.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/EUR/JPY -</strong> The Pound has recouped some losses with Cable back up to 1.2600 from close to 1.2500 at one stage and Eur/Gbp reversing through 0.8900, but Sterling is lagging amidst ongoing COVID-19 and Brexit uncertainty. Similarly, the Franc is cautious awaiting the SNB straddling 0.9450 and hovering just above 1.0550 against the Euro that has regrouped after yesterday’s post-ECB slide in advance of the EU revealing its financial package to fight the pandemic. In stark contrast, the Yen is sharply underperforming on safe-haven unwinding as Usd/Jpy rallies to 106.50+ in wake of yet more speculation about the BoJ expanding its already ultra-accommodative policy with more JGB and other security purchases, ETF buying etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>No real surprise to see the Rouble revel in Brent’s resurrection alongside WTI and other commodities that have been crushed this week, but the Lira seems reluctant to get too carried away due to persistent jitters about relations with Russia on the Syrian front.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>EU debt remains under pressure in contrast to a more mixed/divergent tone in US Treasuries as bonds acknowledge the latest recovery rally in stocks and ponder whether this will prove to be another dead cat bounce or more meaningful correction leading to a sustained bear retracement.

        "content": "<p><strong>NOK/SEK/CNH</strong></p><p>A double dose of good fortune for the hitherto unlucky Norwegian Krona via a rebound in crude prices and additional stimulus as the Norges Bank followed the Fed and BoE with a ½ point ease in the depo rate in advance of its scheduled March policy meeting next week. Eur/Nok reversed further from fresh all time highs above 11.4500 in response to sub-11.2000, as the Bank also shaved 150 bp off the counter-cyclical buffer for banks before rolling out new F-loans at the lower 1% benchmark rate. Conversely, Eur/Sek remains elevated within a 10.7740-9410 range following relatively limited anti-nCoV policy measures from the Riksbank in the form of a fresh credit line and pledge to provide more funding and QE if required, though Sweden’s FSA did slash the CCB to zero from 2.5%. Moreover, in subsequent pressers Norges Bank and Riksbank Governors both underlined that lower benchmark rates are an option if economic conditions worsen, and for the latter that could be warranted given another spike in jobless rates. Not to be completely outdone, the PBoC preannounced lower RRRs ranging from 50-100 bp, and as much as -200% for joint stock banks all to be rolled out from Monday, helping the Yuan recover from under 7.0000 and risk sentiment overall.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Although their US counterpart remains elevated in its own right (<strong>DXY</strong> pivoting 97.500), the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie are all benefiting from a broad revival in risk appetite and especially the former after the RBA supplemented fiscal support with a hefty liquidity boost that helped the ASX turn a whopping loss into a 4%+ gain by the close. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6300+ status and Nzd/Usd is close behind circa 0.6150, while the Loonie is also drawing impetus from the aforementioned bounce in oil to test resistance at 1.3800 vs lows near 1.3950.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>The Pound has recouped some losses with Cable back up to 1.2600 from close to 1.2500 at one stage and Eur/Gbp reversing through 0.8900, but Sterling is lagging amidst ongoing COVID-19 and Brexit uncertainty. Similarly, the Franc is cautious awaiting the SNB straddling 0.9450 and hovering just above 1.0550 against the Euro that has regrouped after yesterday’s post-ECB slide in advance of the EU revealing its financial package to fight the pandemic. In stark contrast, the Yen is sharply underperforming on safe-haven unwinding as Usd/Jpy rallies to 106.50+ in wake of yet more speculation about the BoJ expanding its already ultra-accommodative policy with more JGB and other security purchases, ETF buying etc.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>No real surprise to see the Rouble revel in Brent’s resurrection alongside WTI and other commodities that have been crushed this week, but the Lira seems reluctant to get too carried away due to persistent jitters about relations with Russia on the Syrian front.</p>",

Investor sentiment took a hit from all angles including the lack of solid stimulus efforts so far from US and its ban on travel from the EU, while some countries, businesses and sporting events also announced shutdown measures. ASX 200 (+4.4%) was in panic mode at the open and was dragged lower by heavy losses in financials and the commodity-related sectors with gold miners the worst performers as the precious metal proved to be no hiding place for the ongoing bloodbath, although the index then rebounded as stock markets and US futures recovered from lows with some also attributing it to the RBA injecting AUD 8.8bln of funds through repos during the early morning chaos. Nikkei 225 (-6.2%) saw losses of over 1500 points and briefly slipped below the 17k level for the first time since 2016, before momentarily retracing the majority of the declines. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) conformed to the overnight disarray amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and as China’s industry ministry suggested the global coronavirus epidemic places uncertainty on China's work resumption, while stock markets in South Korea, India, Indonesia and Philippines all triggered circuit breakers earlier in the session but then recouped most the losses in which India briefly retraced the full 10% slump. Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the wide-spread risk aversion and off-schedule BoJ announcement to buy a total of JPY 700bln of JGBs, as prices extended on the prior day’s selling to test the 153.00 level where support eventually held.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>Asset Managers – </strong>FCA has reportedly told asset managers to provide additional information and warnings if investment funds are getting into trouble, according to a memo.

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-3.2%) </strong>and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%)</strong> conformed to the overnight disarray amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and as China’s industry ministry suggested the global coronavirus epidemic places uncertainty on China's work resumption, while stock markets in South Korea, India, Indonesia and Philippines all triggered circuit breakers earlier in the session but then recouped most the losses in which India briefly retraced the full 10% slump. Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the wide-spread risk aversion and off-schedule BoJ announcement to buy a total of JPY 700bln of JGBs, as prices extended on the prior day’s selling to test the 153.00 level where support eventually held.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

In terms of the coronavirus front, there were alarming comments from the UK Scientific Adviser who suggested there could be between 5k-10k people infected in the country at the moment, while Portugal and Belgium have announced containment steps including the closure of all bars, restaurants, sports events and schools in the latter. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> ignored the early panic in equity markets and eventually reclaimed the 105.00 handle to the upside as stocks recovered from their lows, while antipodeans were also range-bound amid a lack of data points and recent selling fatigue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities nursed losses overnight with the initial lacklustre tone seen across the complex amid early panic selling in stocks, but then saw mild support as the chaos in equities moderated which lifted <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures to test USD 32.00/bbl level, but with gains limited amid ongoing coronavirus concerns and with Goldman Sachs estimating a 4.5mln bpd hit to global demand.

The risk sell-off after the Trump presser overnight commenced the bid in government debt, although as US participants arrived, The TPLEX was offered amid poor liquidity; equity futures reaching limit down prior to the cash open only added to the panic. Desks noted the ongoing profit-taking in the long end, on top of likely demand for cash amid the market turmoil. However, the selling found some short-lived reprieve after the NY Fed announced its USD 1.5trln of additional repo operation offerings over Thursday and Friday, as well as its new Treasury purchase schedule which now extends the whole way out the curve.

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Asia stocks sink after Wall St's worst day since Black Monday ",
        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets crash overnight as the global turmoil persists amid further coronavirus-related disruptions and following the near-double-digit losses on Wall St where stocks had their worst day since the Black Monday of 1987. Investor sentiment has been taking a hit across all angles including the lack of solid stimulus efforts so far from US and its ban on travel from the EU, while some countries, businesses and sporting events have also announced shutdown measures. ASX 200 (-6.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-8.4%) remain in panic mode in which Australia is dragged lower by heavy losses in financials and the commodity-related sectors with gold miners the worst performers as the precious metal proves to be no hiding place for the ongoing bloodbath, while the Japanese benchmark fell over 1500 points and slipped below the 17k level for the first time since 2016. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-5.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.9%) conform to the overnight disarray amid further PBoC liquidity inaction and as China’s industry ministry suggested the global coronavirus epidemic places uncertainty on China's work resumption, while KOSPI and Philippines PSEi both triggered circuit breakers earlier after declining 8% and 10% respectively, with investors fleeing the latter after a lockdown was announced for the capital of Manila.</p><p>In FX markets, price action has been relatively tame with the DXY stable around the 97.50 level after having retreated from above 98.00 following the Fed’s USD 1.5tln injection announcement in response to the highly unusual market disruptions, while its major counterparts are mixed which adds to the lack of firm overnight direction. EUR/USD nursed some of the losses seen post-ECB despite the central bank disappointing hopes of a rate cut, with the single currency attempting to reclaim 1.1200 and with GBP/USD continuing to depreciate after this week’s emergency BoE 50bps cut with the pair below the 1.2550. In terms of the coronavirus front, there were alarming comments from the UK Scientific Adviser who suggested there could be between 5k-10k people infected in the country at the moment, while Portugal and Belgium have announced containment steps including the closure of all bars, restaurants, sports events and schools in the latter. Elsewhere, USD/JPY has ignored the panic in equity markets and eyes a reclaim of the 105.00 handle, while antipodeans are also range-bound amid a lack of data points and stabilization in oil prices.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the wide-spread risk aversion and off-schedule BoJ announcement to buy JPY 500bln of JGBs, as prices extended on the prior day’s selling and attempted a breakdown of the 153.00 level where support eventually held.</p>",
