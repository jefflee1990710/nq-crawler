Haliburton (HAL) earnings missed on revenues, while EPS was in line with expectations, which saw the energy company trade lower in the pre-market, however CEO confirming expectations for a high single digit international growth for all of 2019, helped it go positive. Boeing (BA) was red following a PT cut at Credit Suisse and UBS, with the former noting that the latest discoveries increase the risk profile for investors, and the bank can no longer defend the industrial giant’s shares. However, on a positive note Europe's EASA expects to clear Boeing’s 737 MAX for service in January at the earliest as long as things go well, noting the timing between FAA and EASA over 737 MAX return to service is likely to be weeks and not months. Cardinal Health (CAH), McKesson (MCK), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) traded lower after reaching an agreement with two Ohio counties related to the opioid crisis, but failed to reach a broad agreement with thousands of other authorities; however, Teva (TEVA) traded higher as it reportedly only has to pay USD 20mln, lower than the distributors’ USD 215mln.

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 21st October 2019: Equities drift higher in quiet trade; positive US/China commentary cited",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>SNAPSHOT: Equities up, Treasuries down, USD flat, crude down.</strong></li><li><strong>REAR VIEW: Positive US/China trade chatter; No Brexit meaningful vote on Monday.</strong></li><li><strong>COMING-UP: Brexit votes; Canada election results; Canada retail sales, US existing home sales; US Richmond Fed manufacturing; NZ trade.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>With no major US data, speakers, or even A-list earnings on the slate, there was a quiet feel to trade on Monday. Much of the focus was on US/China remarks (generally have leaned positive) and Brexit. Trading ranges were generally thin; Treasury yields are higher, the USD is a touch weaker, equities are drifting higher, while crude is lower.</p><p><strong>* US CHINA: </strong>Over the weekend China Vice President Liu He made positive remarks on trade, noting substantial progress has been made between the US and China, which lays a foundation for the signing of a phased agreement. Liu’s remarks were followed by constructive but cautious remarks by US Commerce Secretary Ross, who noted that there are still outstanding issues in the phase one talks, as well as NEC director Kudlow, who said it was possible that the US might not implement tariffs on Chinese imports that are due to become effective in December, allowing ES futures to modestly move higher to a session high above 3,000. The two sides are to remain in contact ahead of the APEC summit in November, and US President Trump again raised the possibility that a deal might be signed on the sidelines of that summit. Trump also said that the trade deal is coming along great, and that China was now purchasing US agricultural goods. USTR Lighthizer’s remarks were generally toeing the line.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK House Speaker Bercow chose not to allow another meaningful vote on UK PM Johnson’s Brexit deal, but said that it is legitimate for the government to introduce its EU Withdrawal Bill (WAB) for a second reading (the government are set to unveil the Bill this evening, ahead of a vote at 1900 BST on Tuesday). The Bill likely be subject to amendments (on remaining in the customs union, putting the deal to the electorate, and possibly even an amendment that seeks to mimic the impact of the so-called Letwin bill, by ruling out a no deal Brexit at end of the transition period), which complicates its passage. Lawmakers will also on Tuesday vote to approve the expedited timeline to get the Bill through parliament, with many Remainers suggesting that the timeline is too narrow to consider such important legislation, an argument that the government has countered by pointing to the three years of debates that have already taken place on these issues. From the EU perspective, reports suggest it is waiting for clarity on how the legislative agenda in parliament plays out before responding to the UK’s request for an A50 extension. Although most EU leaders have expressed a willingness to provide the UK with an extension if needed, so long as it is accompanied by a UK general election or second referendum, French President Macron appears to prefer offering only a short Brexit extension, in order to exert pressure on UK MPs to accept UK PM Johnson’s deal.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Ahead of its policy meeting on Thursday -- the last of current President Mario Draghi, before ex-IMF chief Lagarde takes the reins at the November meeting -- ECB officials speaking at the IMF meetings over the past weekend hinted that there was little more to come by way of further monetary policy, at least not in the immediate future, despite anticipated downgrades to its economic projections at the December meeting. On a similar theme, the incoming EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Gentiloni penned an op-ed in Italian press arguing that EU budget rules must be reviewed and updated with the aim of having more public spending, especially from governments with fiscal space. The Bundesbank monthly report noted German’s economic output could have fallen slightly again in Q319, due to a weakening of the country’s export-oriented industry. The German central bank said leading indicators show few signs of a sustained recovery in exports and stabilisation in the industrial sector, adding there is a greater risk the downward trend would seep through to more domestically orientated industries. Despite the worries, Bundesbank did note that a clear, broad based recession is not yet apparent, citing retail figures showing consumer confidence was undiminished and the labour market continued to improve, therefore, resulting in favourable income prospects for the consumer.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Deputy Governor<strong> </strong>Debelle's remarks largely echoed the tone of the recent minutes, and he stated that strong house price growth was not a financial stability risk, so long as it is not accompanied by a material expansion in borrowing. Debelle said that even with 75bps of easing, credit growth was still likely to remain low even as prices picked up, since households may be more conservative in their willingness to borrow given low income growth, and lenders are applying tighter standards than in the past.</p><p><strong>* CANADA ELECTIONS PRIMER: </strong>The election is expected to deliver an inconclusive result, raising the possibility of a minority government. PM Trudeau's Liberal Party is pretty much running neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, with both polling a little over 30%. It makes the role of smaller political parties more significant; the consensus view seems to suggest that the New Democrats (NDP, who are more likely to side with Liberal party) and Bloc Quebecois party (who are more likely to side with the Conservatives) could ultimately be the kingmakers. The implied outcome from polls generally leans towards the Conservatives winning more votes, but not enough for a majority. ING explains that the main policy differences between the two leading political parties are around the climate and the energy sector: the Liberals aim to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, front-loading them by improving the targets set for 2030, but are still looking to complete the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which would expand capacity for carrying oil from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast to 890k BPD from the current 300k BPD. On fiscal policy, the Liberals plan to cut small business tax and middle-class taxes, but would levy a 1.0% surcharge for non-residential property buyers, and give first-time buyers 10% off the price of their first home. If the Liberals require support from the NDP, there are risks that it could support higher corporation tax rates, and even a possible wealth tax. Meanwhile, the opposition Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the carbon tax, will also complete the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, and seek other investment in energy transportation. The Conservatives have also pledged to cut taxes for middle-income households deeper than the Liberals; ING believes that markets would prefer the Conservative policy agenda, which may be perceived as potentially more likely to offset the increasing concerns about the global economic outlook.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 0.7% at 3007, NASDAQ-100 0.9% at 7940, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.2% at 26826; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.5%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.3%, Energy&nbsp; 1.9%, Financials&nbsp; 1.4%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.1%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.6%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1.1%, Materials&nbsp; -0.3%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.4%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.4%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: Coty (COTY)</strong> higher after reports it is mulling the sale of its hair and nail products, which could fetch between USD 8-9bln.<strong> HP Enterprises (HPE)</strong> higher after a double upgrade to buy from underperform at Bank of America. <strong>Haliburton (HAL)</strong> earnings missed on revenues, while EPS was in line with expectations, which saw the energy company trade lower in the pre-market, however CEO confirming expectations for a high single digit international growth for all of 2019, helped it go positive.<strong> Boeing (BA)</strong> was red following a PT cut at Credit Suisse and UBS, with the former noting that the latest discoveries increase the risk profile for investors, and the bank can no longer defend the industrial giant’s shares.

On the demand side, analysts at Citi noted that the downside in prices today was a continuation of concerns on slowing global economic growth and US China trade tensions, however, it noted that US equities were trading higher on positive comments from China Vice Premier Liu He over the weekend – the lack of consistency suggests that the oil market could swing higher again if traders were too convert to the equity investors view. On the supply side, the North Sea Buzzard oil field (which has been shut) may possibly reopen on Friday or Saturday, sources said. This week, analysts expect inventory reports to show crude stocks building by 1.7mln bbls, distillates -2.7mln bbls and gasoline -2.3mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 13 TICKS LOWER AT 129-20.</strong> Yields were 4-5bps higher across the Treasury curve, and at settlement, major curve spreads were mixed. The downside was said to be a result of continued positive noises from US/China trade talks, while Brexit is moving in a direction that removes any cliff-edge exit, helping to mitigate a key global risk. This week, the<strong> </strong>US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu); Analysts at UBS note that there are around USD 84bln of cash flows at the end-month settlement (excluding SOMA holdings), including around USD 75bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu); Analysts at UBS note that there are around USD 84bln of cash flows at the end-month settlement (excluding SOMA holdings), including around USD 75bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons. The latest Treasury selling builds a solid concession for all three of this week's auctions, analysts at BMO argue, noting that while yields are still some way off the top of recent ranges, the back-up in bullish extremes will likely prevent any significant supply hiccups; but BMO warns that next week's FOMC (on 31st October) could result in some bidder hesitation. \"Any Fed-related step-back will not be a function of scepticism of another 25bps cut, but rather that Powell may begin to lay the groundwork for a shift back to pause,\" the bank argues. \"To be fair, the odds of a December cut are currently around 25% (assuming a 25bps cut in October) so any down-trade following a hawkish policy adjustment would likely be limited.\" BMO argues that it still thinks that the front-end holds plenty of appeal versus OIS, as well as longer-dated Treasuries, and accordingly, the auction's performance may be a function of intraday price action going into the supply. BMO looks for decent performance at this week's auction, and says this is particularly in the context of the Fed’s reserve management purchases in the bill market, and BMO believes that structural demand from the central bank will offer a tailwind to bills versus OIS, and also a degree of outperformance in short coupons as well. \"The three rounds of bill buying on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday will each be to the tune of USD 7.5bln in maturities one-year and in, and we soon expect these operations as well as the MBS reinvestments will fade into the background, if for no other reason than the first pass which took place last week saw USD 33bln offered from primary dealers to meet the Fed's USD 7.5bln in demand, which is a testament to the depth and liquidity of the very front-end of the Treasury market.\"</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The <strong>GBP</strong> struggled to sustain gains above 1.30 as further delays are put into the Brexit process; the <strong>GBP</strong> and <strong>EUR</strong> were trading up in early trade, with traders reasoning that no deal risks have now fallen substantially; this helped put some pressure on the buck, which was also said to have been pressured by a stronger yuan fixing than was implied by models; the greenback did, however, recoup most of the losses to trade flat heading into APAC trade. Much of the <strong>EMFX</strong> complex took advantage of the buck’s initial weakness, though not the <strong>BRL</strong> nor <strong>MXN</strong>, with LatAm FX being hit by intensifying protests in Chile (Chile the second nation to declare a state of emergency lately, following Ecuador; there are concerns Argentina might be next); BRL will also be paying attention to the final Senate vote on pension reform set to take place on Tuesday. The <strong>CAD</strong>, meanwhile, is trading firmer against the buck ahead of election results, due aftermarket; polls are currently too close to call, analysts said. Although trade was thin, there were no negative tape bombs, allowing the likes of <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> to hold on to gains, while <strong>XAU</strong> fell.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>Overnight, the USDCNY came in lower than model projections, likely on the back of constructive comments on trade talks made by China Vice Premier Liu He on the weekend; additionally, some had expected the PBOC to cut its Loan Prime Rate, but left both the 1-year and the 5-year unchanged at 4.2% and 4.85% respectively. ING said that the question is now whether the central bank believes it is unnecessary to reduce rates now, given better than expected September data, or whether it wants to keep the interest rate cut 'bullet' for the future, in case trade tensions escalate further.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>Desks suggest that Petrobras' upcoming auction of drilling rights could provide support to the real (depending on the dates of settlement, of course - some have suggested it could come in December) given the oil names will be bidding over USD 20bln for the aforementioned rights. The auction would help to offset some of the USD 32bln of outflows Brazil has so far over the last 12 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NOK/SEK/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Norwegian and Swedish Krona are back in the ascendency, or rather rebounding further from recent lows in what appears to be a technical correction ahead of this Thursday’s Scandi Central Bank meetings when the Riksbank could reaffirm guidance for another 25 bp rise in the key repo rate late this year or in early 2020. However, a broad upturn in risk appetite is also helping the Nok and Sek remain on the recovery path vs a toppy Eur with the respective crosses down through 10.1550 and 10.7200 respectively at one stage, former largely shrugging off soft oil prices at the same time. Meanwhile, the Kiwi and Aussie consolidated/cemented gains around the 0.6400 handle and just shy of 0.6900, with the latter poised to test a key resistance area from 0.6895-0.6909 on any further Greenback weakness given more positive US-China trade noises (NEC’s Kudlow stating that mid-December tariffs could be lifted if Phase 1 talks proceed well). On that note, the <strong>DXY</strong> is hovering just above support and the 97.000 mark within a 97.393-144 range, with Usd/<strong>CNH</strong> easing towards 7.0600 vs a 7.0680 Usd/<strong>CNY </strong>midpoint fix overnight.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>The Pound and Loonie are both off best levels vs the Buck awaiting the next Brexit developments and Canadian election results, but not before Cable printed fresh multi-month highs above 1.3000 when stops were triggered and Usd/Cad ducked under support just over 1.3100 to test the water below. Sterling is now digesting HoC Speaker Bercow’s decision to reject the Government’s motion to re-present the WAB on both counts of substance and circumstance after judging that PM Johnson sending a letter of request to the EU does not represent a persuasive argument for a change in the latter. However, Cable remains relatively bid around 1.2980 and Eur/Gbp is holding below 0.8600, albeit not quite as low as last Thursday’s 0.8575 base, while Usd/Cad remains very close to 1.3100 awaiting the first exit polls that are expected to emerge from around 7-8 pm local time.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All softer vs the US Dollar against the backdrop of improved risk sentiment, as Usd/Jpy continues to straddle 108.50, Eur/Usd pivots 1.1150 and Usd/Chf spans 0.9850. Note, the Yen failed to seriously test the 10 DMA at 108.26 or decent option expiries between 108.30-45 (1.4 bn) at NY cut-off time, but the Euro was very close to 1 bn from 1.1150-60.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira and Real are on the backfoot amidst ongoing attention and concern about Turkey’s military offensive in Syria as the Finance Minister accuses those countries resorting to or threatening sanctions as blackmailing the nation, while the Brl is feeling the heat from unrest in Chile. Usd/Try has been back over 5.8500 and Usd/Brl climbed above 4.1450 before fading.</p>",

        "subject": "BREXIT ANALYSIS: Can Johnson get his deal ratified by the 31st October? ",
        "content": "<p><strong>* THE LATEST: </strong>Parliament’s vote on the government’s recently negotiated Brexit deal was postponed on Saturday, after lawmakers voted (322-306) in favour of passing the Letwin amendment, which withholds approval of the Brexit deal until legislation to ratify it is passed and forces UK PM Johnson to request a Brexit extension to January 31st under the Benn Act. UK PM Johnson sent a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension, however, he did not sign the letter and sent 2 other letters alongside it, in which he stated that the extension request was from Parliament and urged the EU not to grant the extension. The EU has not yet responded to the request and, as many desks have noted, may prefer to play the waiting game to see how things unfold in Westminster.</p><p><strong>* MEANINGFUL VOTE 2.0: </strong>This morning, the government announced its intentions to have another crack at the ‘meaningful vote’ that should have taken place on Saturday. Here, the hope would be that if the government can demonstrate it has a majority for its deal, it would give momentum to the passage of the withdrawal agreement bill later in the week. The Financial Times reported that there are now 11 Labour MPs on-board with the PM’s deal, which, when combined with the 28 ‘Spartans’ and ex-Conservative independents, means there narrowly could be enough support. However, it is up to UK House Speaker Bercow as to whether or not such a vote goes ahead. Parliamentary rules say the same motion cannot be voted on twice in a parliamentary session, so if he says no, PM Johnson will have to introduce the full WAB for second reading. Expectations are that he will not allow another meaningful vote to occur.</p><p><strong>* AMENDMENTS:</strong> A second reading of the government’s WAB is effectively a new 'meaningful vote', in which MPs will be asked if they broadly support the bill or not. Although the numbers look to be in the PM's favour, amendments, such as one to keep the UK in the Customs Union, could derail process; the last time a Custom’s Union was voted on - as part of the 'indicative votes' back in the Spring - the idea was narrowly defeated, with 273 MPs voting in favour and 276 against. ING flag the risk that things could be a little different now; last time, 89 lawmakers abstained, but some may be more minded to vote 'for' a customs union this time as they may see this amendment as their best chance of derailing the government's efforts to get its deal ratified. If the customs union amendment passes, the assumption is that the bill would lose the support of the 28 Conservative Spartans, potentially destroying the fragile majority for the prime minister's deal. At the moment, a vote on the second reading of government deal is scheduled for 19:00 BST on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>* PROGRAMME MOTION: </strong>If the second reading of the bill passes parliament, then the government will need to indicate how it intends to get it through parliament before 31 October. By historical standards, 10 days is ‘ambitious’ timeframe to get a bill approved by lawmakers, notes ING. Lawmakers will need to approve this timeline. ING asks, given that this is a matter of significant importance, will MPs be comfortable with the legislation going through so quickly and with minimal scrutiny? This could be a challenge for the government, and failure to get this motion approved will basically rule out leaving the EU on 31 October, the bank argues.</p><p><strong>* WHAT ELSE TO WATCH THIS WEEK:</strong> Separately, UBS flag the importance of the EU27’s response to the UK’s A50 extension request. UBS suspect that EU will not respond until there is a clear message from the House of Commons, which they think would help UK PM Johnson insistence of Oct. 31 as the final date for the deal to be passed. Finally, Scotland's Court of Session will examine whether the extension request was in line with the law, given that PM Johnson sent two letters alongside the extension request, which expressed that he didn't actually want an extension. UBS say this is a “side show” and will not drive markets, concluding that the key point is that the request is sent, and whether or not the PM signed the letter isn't of market relevance.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT BY 31 OCTOBER?</strong> Goldman think there is a strong probability that the UK can leave the EU with a deal by the end of the month, assigning a subjective 70% to the outcome. “In our view, the incentives of the Johnson government and the incentives of EU-27 leaders are aligned in aiming to secure an orderly Brexit as soon as possible” states the bank, adding that “from this perspective, the greater the ambiguity surrounding the duration and terms of any Article 50 extension — and the longer that decision is deferred — the greater the pressure on MPs in the House of Commons to come to a firm decision on the merits of the new Withdrawal Agreement.” However, ING flag the possibility that, if an undesirable amendment passes on its second reading of the WAB, such as on a customs union, the government could decide to pull the plug on the whole thing and take the fight to a general election. If the government goes with the latter option, posits ING, then there may well be a vote at some point this week on whether to trigger a general election, meaning the UK could feasibly go to the polls in late November or early December. This would require an extension from the EU, which they have already indicated they would grant.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has staged a strong comeback from post-super Saturday lows amidst increasingly bullish calls for the Pound and more bouts of short covering on the premise that the risk of a hard Brexit is declining with every move by UK Parliament to assume control of proceedings and/or force another Article 50 extension. Cable snuffed out stops around 1.3000 after eclipsing last week’s 1.2990 peak, but topped out around 1.3012 and Eur/Gbp retreated through 0.8600, though the cross held above last Thursday’s 0.8575 base as the single currency climbed alongside its UK counterpart.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although Sterling’s resilience awaiting PM Johnson’s next move and attempt to put his WA to the HoC is noteworthy, the Antipodean Dollars are outperforming and extending their recovery gains vs the Greenback as the Kiwi climbs above 0.6400 and Aussie nudged over 0.6875. The improvement in US-China trade relations and less dovish on balance near term RBNZ and RBA policy outlooks have underpinned the Nzd and Aud, while the <strong>YUAN</strong> is also maintaining momentum with the aid of steady PBoC mid-point fixes.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie is benefiting from broad Buck weakness, as Usd/Cad eyes 1.3100 and support residing just ahead of the big figure, while the <strong>DXY </strong>has declined through 97.280 Fib support to fresh sub-97.200 lows and closer to the next downside chart target before 97.000 even (97.033 lows from August). Not much sign of Canadian election jitters or pressure via the ongoing retracement in crude prices, with Tuesday’s retail sales data expected to reveal stronger consumption. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd has been tracking Cable as noted above, but also buoyed by higher Eurozone debt yields on its way up towards 1.1180 and conscious of decent layered option expiry interest from 1.1120-30 (1 bn) through 1.1150-60 (1 bn) to 1.1200 (1.1 bn), while the 200 DMA is also in close proximity (1.1209). Conversely, the Franc and Yen are lagging on mild risk-on trade and safe-haven unwinding, as Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf pivot 108.50 and 0.9850 respectively after weaker than forecast Japanese trade data overnight and a decline in weekly Swiss sight deposits.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/TRY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns are both clawing back losses amidst the aforementioned risk positive tone, and also consolidating ahead of Thursday’s Riksbank and Norges Bank meetings that preface the ECB convene and could see the former retain guidance for tightening around the turn of the year. Eur/Nok has retreated from new record highs around 10.2440 to sub-10.1900 and Eur/Sek has pulled back further from peaks over 10.9300 to just under 10.7300 at one stage. However, geopolitical jitters have resurfaced to blight Turkey’s Lira after initial relief in wake of the 5-day ceasefire in Syria, with Usd/Try back above 5.8200 in advance of this week’s CBRT rate decision (also on Thursday and contributing to a Central Bank fest) and weighing up whether 1-week repo will be cut again, and if so by how much.</p>",

Some desks may see this as proof that the central bank is reluctant to allow further indications toward broader easing, despite China's growth slowing to the weakest in 27 years. The question now, says ING, is whether China believes it's unnecessary to reduce interest rates given better than expected September data, or whether it wants to keep the interest rate cut 'bullet' for the future in case trade tensions escalate further. Regardless, ING still expect the PBoC to cut its RRR rate in Q4, even if there is a \"phase one deal\" released in November. “The Chinese economy has suffered from a long trade war (since March 2018), and the cumulative damage has been increasingly obvious when you look at the data”, says the bank, citing the Y/Y decline in September smartphone production as one piece of evidence. An RRR cut is therefore expected to put downward pressure on interest rates, concludes the bank, adding that this will help both the public sector to finance infrastructure projects and the private sector to reduce interest costs.&nbsp;</p>",

Remarks from Fed officials did not deliver any explicit signal ahead of the blackout period, though none leaned too heavily on market pricing, which is pricing a 25bps rate cut with a very high degree of certainty; and this is in keeping with recent commentary (Evans sees no further cuts this year, Kaplan is agnostic, Williams is yet to decide, Powell last week said he was taking it meeting-by-meeting, and Clarida today provided two-way arguments); amid Clarida’s remarks, the TPLEX was stable though equities came under pressure. US T-notes (Z9) settled 4 ticks higher at 130-01.</p><p><strong>Fed’s Clarida (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said policy is not a pre-set course and decisions will be made \"meeting by meeting\", while he added the US economy in good place with no evidence of strong labour market putting pressure on inflation. However, Clarida also noted that growth in H2 will be slower than H1, that global manufacturing is slipping and that they have seen a downshift in overall growth relative to the July meeting.

(Unch.) conformed to the indecision after the PBoC injected liquidity via open market operations but refrained from anticipated cuts to its Loan Prime Rates, with Hong Kong also mildly underpinned after China revised rules to permit mainland investors to trade Hong Kong-listed dual class shares through the Stock Connect. Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower in which prices retested prior support around the 154.00 level and with demand subdued as Japanese stocks remained afloat, although downside was stemmed amid the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1.16tln of JGBs in up to 10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week with a cautious tone following last Friday’s lacklustre close on Wall St and amid continued Brexit uncertainty after MPs forced a delay of the vote on UK PM Johnson’s Brexit deal. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are mixed with underperformance seen in Australia’s tech sector as WiseTech Global shares slump on return from its trading halt with investors spooked by a recent short seller report which alleged the Co. is overstating profits. However, resilience in the property and mining sectors has limited the losses in Sydney, while Tokyo trade is just about kept afloat by mild JPY weakness as a larger than expected contraction in exports data adds to the pressure for the BoJ to act. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) conform to the indecision and have diverged after the PBoC injected liquidity via open market operations but refrained from anticipated cuts to its Loan Prime Rates, with Hong Kong mildly underpinned after China revised rules to permit mainland investors to trade Hong Kong-listed dual class shares through the Stock Connect.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is relatively stable with minimal gains seen amid weakness in its transatlantic counterparts in which EUR/USD was pressured near 1.1150 and GBP/USD briefly gave back the 1.2900 handle after ‘Super Saturday’ failed to live up to the hype and the Brexit deal vote was postponed as lawmakers passed the Letwin amendment. This effectively withheld approval of the Brexit deal and therefore forced PM Johnson to request a Brexit extension to January 31st under the Benn Act, and although the PM obliged as required by law, he refused to sign the letter and sent further correspondence urging the EU not to grant the extension. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses mirror the mixed trade in their base currencies with gradual pressure observed in Japan’s currency following a 10th consecutive contraction of its exports, while antipodeans shrugged off early downside after a relatively stable CNY reference rate and with NZD/USD the outperformer as it eyes the 0.6400 handle to the upside.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower in which prices retested prior support around the 154.00 level and with demand also subdued as Japanese stocks remained afloat, although downside is stemmed amid the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1.16tln of JGBs in up to 10yr maturities.</p>",
