Earnings: CMCSA, INTC, PG, LUV</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP: </strong>Equity futures in the US got off on the front foot, following their losses earlier in the week from the coronavirus, before paring into the cash close; tech remained the outperforming sector, seeing the NDQ’s relative outperformance (TSLA surging above 100bln market cap helped), whilst energy lagged on the back of crude prices continuing to decline amid supply-gut concerns out of Libya, falling jet-fuel demand amid the coronavirus and position unwinding from stretched long positions. The BoC stood pat as expected, although introduced expectations for potential future cuts amid cutting its outlook on the Canadian economy; CAD traded lower against the greenback. No tier 1 data out of the US, although earnings season continues, with NFLX and JNJ disappointing on guidance, whilst IBM impressed investors - note CMCSA, INTC, PG report on Thursday – whilst BA dragged on industrials after some negative mentions at research houses on ongoing 737 MAX woes. Looking ahead more broadly, the ECB and Norges are both expected to stand pat on Thursday, ahead of PMIs on both sides of the pond on Friday.</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The bank of Canada left rates unchanged at 1.75% as expected. The MPR showed the bank now expects 2020 GDP growth at 1.6% (Prev. 1.7%), and for 2021 to rise to 2.0% from 1.8%, analysts had expected this to be the case due to positive trade developments. However, RBC highlight “with the economy no longer seen as operating close to full capacity, the bank's tolerance for sub-trend growth is likely to be limited”. Focus lied within the statement where the bank removed its description of the key rate “as appropriate”. The bank also highlighted that the output gap will be wider than previously projected, and the Canadian economy is no longer close to operating close to capacity. The bank was also cognizant on the consumer as indicators such as consumer confidence and spending have been unexpectedly soft. On the global economy, the bank noted that “a high degree of uncertainty remains”, despite an easing of trade tensions. The BoC also lowered its estimate for its output gap to lie between -1.25% to -0.25% (Prev. -1.00% and 0.00%), whilst maintaining its neutral rate estimate at 2.25% to 3.25%. The dovish language saw immediate CAD weakness and a turnaround in market pricing, which heading into the release priced in 5% chance of a 25bp hike, flipped to a 20% chance of a cut at the March meeting, with 26bps worth of easing priced in for the end of 2020, up from 12.5bps prior. During the press conference, Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins initially sounded more upbeat than the statement noting consumer confidence could have bottomed out in December, whilst Wilkins highlighted the bank forecasts a rebound, and she does not think the mixed data will be persistent. On the output gap, Poloz noted the estimate is based on a partially updated estimate of the economy's potential and therefore there could be more uncertainty than usual over the current estimate. However, the highlight of the press conference seemed to be further dovish commentary noting the door is obviously open to an interest rate cut, although it would occur on a data dependent basis. Poloz added some of the risks mentioned in October have landed and the sense of whether we need easing are obviously present in the analysis. Although, Poloz highlighted that interest rates are still “really low”.</p><p><strong>* ECB PREVIEW:</strong> Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45GMT, (13:45CET, 07:45ET), On Thursday 23rd January 2020, Press Conference due At 13:30GMT, (14:30CET, 08:30ET). The ECB are expected to stand pat on rates this week, according to surveyed analysts with markets currently pricing in around a 25% chance of a 10bps rate reduction at the first meeting of 2020; note, less than 3bps worth of loosening is currently priced in throughout the year. Focus for the press conference will centre around the upcoming strategic review and how policymakers at the Bank evaluate the Eurozone’s growth prospects in lieu of recent macro developments.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23674/download\"><i>Click here for the full preview.</i></a></p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The WHO delayed its decision to declare the coronavirus as an international emergency until tomorrow as they are treating the complex and evolving situation very carefully. The death toll reportedly ticked up to 17 in China, with individual cases reported around the 500 mark. Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, has suspended public travel leaving the region and advises locals to only travel under extreme circumstances. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-coronavirus-contagion-concerns-22-01-2020\">Click here for full analysis.</a></p><p><strong>* US/EUROPE TRADE: </strong>US President Trump said there is no timeline on the EU auto tariffs but believes a deal will be made before the 2020 election; on Tuesday, Trump warned of implementing auto tariffs if no deal is reached. Furthermore, progress on a US-EU trade deal has been hampered by Brussels' refusal to negotiate on agriculture, a sensitive area for the bloc, according to Politico citing a statement after a meeting between US President Trump and EC President von der Leyen; the latter was later reported to express her optimism on an EU-US trade that will cover trade, technology and energy, \"We’re expecting in a few weeks to have an agreement that we can sign together.\" Meanwhile, a German ambassador said that the EU would respond to US tariffs with its own, although the bloc is seeking a negotiated settlement with the US over aircraft subsidies and digital taxes.</p><p><strong>* UK CBI TRENDS (JAN): </strong>A solid CBI, with the total orders balance ticking up to -22 from -28 (street was looking for -23). The sub-components were where the bulk of the positive story emanates from, with the quarterly business optimism balance jumping to +23 in Q1, from -44 in Q4, well above the consensus, -20. The survey provides more evidence that the general election has triggered a positive step-change in business confidence. \"It's particularly encouraging to see the business optimism balance rise to its highest level since Q2 2014, even though the government has reaffirmed that it will pursue a hard Brexit,\" Pantheon writes, but with that said, \"the survey always is conducted in the first half of the month—the CBI hasn't released the exact dates yet—so it probably has not captured manufacturers’ reaction to Chancellor Javid’s comments that 'there will not be alignment' to EU rules and regulations post-Brexit.\" Additionally, the survey's sample size is small (just 300 manufacturers participated, which is about half of the size of the Markit survey). And the MPC is more likely to be influenced by the PMI data (out Friday), before making its decision on rates next week. Pantheon says that after adjusting for its seasonality and excessive volatility, it judge that the total orders balance is consistent with a rise in the manufacturing PMI to 49.3 in January, from 47.5 in December, only a bit above the current consensus, 48.8. \"Confidence in the services sector will have to recover sharply too for the composite PMI to exceed the 52.5 level we judge the MPC wants to see to keep rates on hold, though the initial signs from Deloitte’s CFO survey and other indicators are positive,\" and \"as a result, we are maintaining our forecast for the composite PMI to jump to 53.0 in January.\"</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES (DEC): </strong>It was a solid rise in December, with the rate of existing home sales rising to 5.54mln from 5.35mln, a bigger rise than the expected 5.43mln. Analysts had suggested that the Fed's insurance rate cuts last year had nudged the buyers out. However, Wells Fargo notes that inventories remain thin. Nevertheless, Wells Fargo expects sales to rise further in 2020, by a rate of 1.4%, although it needs to see evidence of more sellers to achieve that level, noting that the number of homes for sale in December declined 14.6% M/M, adding that at the current pace, there is just 3.0 month’s supply of homes available.</p><p><strong>* CHICAGO FED NATIONAL ACTIVITY INDEX: </strong>The Chicago Fed reported that its National Activity Index fell to was -0.35 in December from +0.41 in November. Declines were driven by production-related indicators, it said, with three of the four broad categories of indicators that make up the index decreasing from November, and three of the four categories making negative contributions. With that said, the index’s three-month moving average moved up to –0.23 in December from –0.31 in November.</p><p><strong>* CANADIAN CPI (DEC):</strong> Headline consumer prices were unchanged in December, against an expected rise of 0.1%; the Y/Y rate was at 2.2%, in line with expectations. An average of the three BOC measures fell to 2.1% from 2.17% in November. Capital Economics said that while the BOC measures were unchanged, the directions partly offset each other: \"CPI-common rose to 2.0%, from 1.9%, while CPI-median declined to 2.2% from a downwardly-revised 2.3% and CPI-trim fell by 0.1%-point to 2.1%. An average of the three remained at 2.1% [to 1 dp], in line with average of the previous few months.\" CapEco says that given the recent softness of real economic activity, it expects both headline and core inflation to decline toward 1.5% in the next few quarters.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 1.64 LOWER AT USD 56.74/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 1.38 LOWER AT USD 63.21/BBL:</strong> The losses in oil markets extended on Wednesday amid supply-glut concerns out of Libya, position unwinding and the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. The losses were most acutely felt as US participants came to their desks, coinciding with the energy cash markets opening, and found its lows just prior to settlement. Desks note concerns of Libyan production outages being more short-lived than previously anticipated. Some are also attributing the losses to the coronavirus in China with growing fears of the potential impact on Chinese growth and more directly, demand for jet oil amid restricted travel. Furthermore, Citigroup analysts note that they are continuing to see a rebalancing factor at play, \"money managers may have further to go in reducing what had been the largest net long positions since October 2018 to more conservative levels,\" further adding, \"Those attempting to hedge more general inflation risk may also be among those selling, as the decline in price versus the rally of a year ago suddenly makes the Y/Y comparison in oil prices look much weaker.\" There could also be some book squaring ahead of the US inventory data, with the private preliminary release due later on Wednesday. Current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks -1mln, distillates +1mln and gasoline +3.1mln.</p><p>*<strong> US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 1 TICK LOWER AT 129-17+. </strong>A rather lacklustre<strong> </strong>session for the TPLEX regarding price action, where the T-Note came off its lows modestly from the earlier session; by settlement, yields were little changed with the 10-year at 1.77%. Participants have had little data to dig into out of the US ahead of Friday’s PMIs, with the ECB meeting (on Thursday) and Fed meeting next week expected to be mainly non-events, whilst US earnings have not set off any alarm signals on the strength of the US economy. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has been drifting lower for the past few weeks closer to its multi-month, key support level of approximately 1.7%, this week’s outbreak of coronavirus has only supported the move.</p><p><strong>* HUAWEI:</strong> Huawei is stockpiling up to a year's worth of supplies amid fears of toughening US tech sanction which the company anticipates could happen next month, according to sources cited by Nikkei. There are no details about the scope or timing of the widely rumoured tightening of sanctions; two sources close to Huawei said the company anticipates it could happen next month. Industry sources, Asian government officials and lawyers believe the ban could be extended to include US-made equipment from companies such as Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA Group (KLAC) that is used to manufacture chips. Some US hawks are reportedly seeking an outright quarantine on all sales to Huawei, several industry and government sources said.</p><p><strong>* STOCK CLOSES: </strong>SPX UNCHANGED AT 3321; DOW UNCHANGED AT 289186; NDX +0.24% AT 9188</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) traded lower, despite beating estimates for the quarter, after it gave lacklustre subscription growth guidance. IBM (IBM) traded higher after beating top and bottom line estimates for the quarter, whilst providing rosy guidance. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) traded lower after disappointing on Revenue and guidance. ASML (ASML) posted a strong quarter but the stock traded subdued, with some desks noting concern over its new share repurchase programme. Capital One (COF) outperformed after a strong quarter. United Continental (UAL) opened higher after beating EPS and Revenue, although reversed course through the session alongside some 737 MAX-related guidance. Baker Hughes (BKR) took a hit after disappointing top and bottom line expectations.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla’s (TSLA) surge higher brought it over the USD 100bln market cap mark on Wednesday, with the share price reaching just shy of USD 595 at its peak, after a positive mention at Wedbush alongside a PT rise. Boeing (BA) traded lower amid a downgrade at Vertical and cautious mentions among analysts following the extended 737 MAX grounding.

The losses were most acutely felt as US participants came to their desks, coinciding with the energy cash markets opening, and found its lows just prior to settlement. Desks note concerns of Libyan production outages being more short-lived than previously anticipated. Some are also attributing the losses to the coronavirus in China with growing fears of the potential impact on Chinese growth and more directly, demand for jet oil amid restricted travel. Furthermore, Citigroup analysts note that they are continuing to see a rebalancing factor at play, \"money managers may have further to go in reducing what had been the largest net long positions since October 2018 to more conservative levels,\" further adding, \"Those attempting to hedge more general inflation risk may also be among those selling, as the decline in price versus the rally of a year ago suddenly makes the Y/Y comparison in oil prices look much weaker.\" There could also be some book squaring ahead of the US inventory data, with the private preliminary release due later on Wednesday. Current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks -1mln, distillates +1mln and gasoline +3.1mln.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>The Pound is now in pole position on the G10 grid with Cable firmly back above 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp under 0.8450 in wake of January’s CBI industrial trends survey that only just eclipsed consensus on headline orders, but contained some really promising details beneath the hood. In particular, expectations for manufacturing production rebounded to +4 from -7 and the business situation gauge spiked to +23 from -44, while the probability of a January MPC ease has fallen to around 50% from nearer 70% at one stage. Back to Sterling, Cable topped out just over 1.3150 and the cross bottomed a few pips below a Fib retracement level and not far from daily chart support ahead of 0.8400 seen circa 0.8418. Conversely, the Loonie has reversed to the bottom of the major rankings on the back of a dovish/cautious BoC that no longer deems current rates as appropriate by definition given the removal of the explicit phrase. Moreover, after trimming its 2020 GDP estimate the accompanying MPR also noted that the economy is no longer running close to capacity and the output gap has grown since the last report in October. Usd/Cad spiked around half a big figure initially having largely shrugged off mixed Canadian data in the form of CPI, new house prices and wholesale trade, roughly in line with the move signalled via option break-evens, and an earlier January peak, but then extended to almost 1.3140 before waning into the impending post-meeting press conference by Governor Poloz and colleague Wilkins from 16.15GMT.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>has huffed and puffed around 97.500, largely due to fluctuations elsewhere, and beyond the more pronounced moves noted above. However, the index remains poised for another assault on the nearest technical resistance target at the 200 DMA having temporarily breached the marker on Monday, but not sustaining bullish momentum.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/EUR/AUD/CHF</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie have been relatively steady against their US peer and vs each other awaiting top tier Antipodean data tomorrow that could have a big bearing on the next RBNZ and RBA rate calls (inflation and jobs respectively). Meanwhile, the Yen has encircled 110.00 amidst some further re-weakening in the Yuan due to the spreading Chinese coronavirus, and the Euro has been plagued by more Italian political uncertainty following the departure of coalition co-partner 5SM leader Di Maio, according to multiple reports in the media and via sources ahead of an impending statement from the man himself. Last, but by no means least, the Franc saw volatility and heavy selling around London fixes, per market observers, but has been paring declines since.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Broad gains vs the Usd as China bolsters measures to contain the contagious and life threatening epidemic, but the Rand also seeing more of a technical correction and post-SARB ease short covering following in-line SA CPI, while the Lira has digested less dovish CBRT commentary from Davos including guidance pointing to policy entering a fine-tuning stage and underscoring intentions to get inflation down to single digits.</p>",

There were comments from China Disease Control Center chief Gao that the new coronavirus is adapting and mutating.</p><p>US Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of coronavirus for the US in Washington state, while it also noted that there are active conversations regarding vaccines and diagnostics for the Wuhan Coronavirus with the National Institutes of Health.</p><p><strong>*MARKET RELEVANCE:</strong> Markets have been using the spread of the coronavirus as justification for recent pullbacks in stocks and energy. Areas subjected to Asia, travel, healthcare and oil have been afflicted - but desks note that the developments are not currently thought to be a macro issue.</p><ul><li>Healthcare names, particularly in Asia, have been supported by the spread</li><li>Airline stocks have been weighed on as flights see cancellations, predominantly ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year – seen as the largest human migration event of the year</li><li>Energy is pressured amid concerns surrounding the global growth aspect alongside demand woes as airlines see cancelled flights</li></ul><p>As the virus spread to the US, analysts at CapEco are adamant that US travel and retails sales will be hit as much as the 2003 SARS epidemic, primarily as the mortality rate for the coronavirus appears to be significantly lower than SARS. “The upshot is that even if this first isolated case of the Wuhan virus in the US develops into a full-scale epidemic, which is unlikely, we wouldn't expect it to have a significant negative impact on economic activity.” – CapEco concludes.</p><p>Desks have suggested that the virus might result in profit-taking ahead of China's Lunar New Year holidays, beginning Friday. There is no certainty about what the impact could be on growth metrics, but a downward bias has been assumed (the SARS epidemic of 2003 is believed to have taken 0.15ppts off global growth that year). One implication may be that traders also dismiss any optimistic survey data that is released in the weeks' ahead, since it would not include the impact of the virus. Indeed, crude desks have suggested that the outbreak might provide a negative shock to global oil demand, perhaps to the tune of around 260k BPD, and this demand hit may outweigh concerns on the supply front, according to Goldman Sachs. For the fixed income markets and the USD, UBS thinks the bias lends to lower Treasury yields and a higher dollar in the near-term.</p><p><strong>*MEASURES:</strong> In an attempt to tackle the outbreak, China is poised to start nationwide screenings. The China National Health Commission said Wuhan City (the origin of the outbreak) is to establish a daily communication system and that China has banned live animals including poultry from entering Wuhan. Officials are also boosting the monitoring of transportation links, according to the China NHC.</p><p>Furthermore, NHC said there has been effective work on tracking the origin of the virus and that there is no evidence so far of super spreaders.</p><p>The World Health Organisation is to conduct an emergency meeting later today (time TBC) to assess the severity of the virus and provide an update on its classification.</p><p>Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel or trade due to the virus.</p>",

RBC are part of the consensus on the M/M print, although believe it will see the Y/Y at 2.3%. The BoC core figures are seen maintaining a 0.2% decline M/M and 1.9% rise Y/Y, according to IFI’s estimates.</li><li>The BoC-eyed Mean/Trim/Common stood at 2.4%, 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively, taking the average to 2.17% in November, sitting ever so slightly above the mid-point of its 1-3% target range and just above the 1.9-2.1% range seen since February. RBC write “Year-ago comparables suggest little bias this time around, though a small output gap suggests a move back down to the previous range may occur”. The Canadian bank expects the usual seasonal declines to be offset by an increase in airfares and result in a pick-up in December whilst highlighting the Y/Y figure is being driven by rising gas prices, which have rebounded from the September Y/Y decline of 10%, to +6.5% in December. Elsewhere, the recent BoC Survey of Consumer Expectations (Q4) saw consumer expectations of 1yr ahead inflation fall slightly to 2.2% from 2.4%, although most expect inflation remaining within the 1-3% target range.&nbsp;</li><li>The data will be followed by the BoC’s latest interest rate decision. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23678/download\">Click here for a full preview.</a></li></ul>",

Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.9%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) </strong>managed to rebound from opening weakness as outperformance in Consumer Staples, Tech and Healthcare underpinned the Australian benchmark to a fresh all-time high, while Tokyo sentiment was mainly driven by currency moves but with weakness seen in some automakers including Mitsubishi Motors after several of its locations were raided in Germany on suspicion of using emission cheating devices. <strong>KOSPI (+1.2%)</strong> gained with Hyundai Motor boosted amid earnings despite missing expectations on Q4 net as it still showed a turnaround from the loss Y/Y and both its operating profit and revenue topped forecasts. Elsewhere<strong>, Hang Seng (+1.3%) </strong>nursed some of the prior day’s near-3% losses and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> eventually joined in on the recovery after it initially slipped to its lowest levels so far this year due to the ongoing outbreak fears and after experts suggested the possibility of a mutation in the coronavirus. Finally, 10yr JGBs were indecisive amid a pullback in T-notes which retraced some of the prior day’s advances after hitting resistance around 129.20 and with prices also failing to benefit despite slightly firmer demand at the enhanced-liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos.

Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.6%) lags its peers with the Italian Banking Index hitting 6-week lows – on the back of Di Maio’s resignation as the Italian 5SM leader. On the other end of the spectrum, SMI (+0.6%) outperforms with almost all of its stocks in positive territory. Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the overall market sentiment. In terms of individual movers, Airbus (+1.7%) shares are supported after a source noted that Boeing doesn’t expect regulators to sign off on the 737 Max until June or July, months later than the manufacturer previously expected. Traders also attribute the losses in Tui (-4.3%) to the Boeing news. Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.7%) reversed opening gains on the back of another profit warning in which it expects FY19 results to be below forecasts, with the return on sales of Mercedes-Benz vans also forecast below prior guidance. Meanwhile, ASML (-1.2%) shrugged off a mostly in-line earnings report and a EUR 6bln share buy-back programme, potentially on concerns that the Co. may not completed this programme given that the FY19 share buy-back was incomplete. <strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>CHF/EUR -</strong> Although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China’s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday’s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning?</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD -</strong> The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday’s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs. Elsewhere, Sterling is rangy in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms either side of 1.3050 and 0.8500 awaiting Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs that could well be the final jigsaw pieces for next week’s BoE policy meeting, and similarly the Loonie is biding time between 1.3050-1.3100 in the run up to Canadian CPI just before the BoC.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Rand continues its recovery from worst levels after in line SA CPI and last week’s surprise SARB ease prompted Usd/Zar upside to test the 200 DMA yesterday, but also as the Dollar stalls after another look at the same DXY chart resistance level around 97.720. However, the Rouble is fading after a fleeting relief rally on the formation of a new Russian Government alongside oil prices towards 62.0000 again.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> appear to have led the latest recovery leg in mainstream debt, but Bunds were first to bounce from worst levels and not just due to the fact that Liife gets under way hours after Eurex. However, more upbeat UK macro news via the latest CBI industrial trends survey has nudged the 10 year benchmark off its 133.73 perch in contrast to its German peer that just rebounded to 172.43 and a fresh intraday/multi-week peak despite an even more emphatic/impressive revival in BTPs of over 1 full point from the depths, albeit still underwater. Elsewhere, a rather begrudging/reluctant grind higher in <strong>US Treasuries</strong> ahead of housing data and into key/psychological levels, like 129-20 in the 10 year note future/1.75% cash yield.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front-month futures remain lacklustre in mid-week trade – with participants pointing dampened sentiment on the coronavirus outbreak alongside demand woes for the complex, amid lower demand from airlines in light of cancelled flights ahead of the Chinese Lunar Year. Bearish supply-side fundamentals also weigh on the futures as EIA expects US total shale oil production to rise by 22k BPD in February to 9.2mln, with a predominant increase by the Permian. WTI meanders around USD 58/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.57/bbl and the 100 DMA at 57.29, whilst the Brent contract fell below its 100 DMA (62.79/bbl) with eyes on its 200 DMA at 63.97/bbl as Mar’20 futures test yesterday’s low just above 64/bbl. As a reminder, the weekly API Private crude inventories will be released later today on account of Monday’s MLK US market holiday. <strong>Spot gold</strong> prices have clambered off overnight lows after a test of the 1550/oz to the downside and ahead of potential modest resistance at its 50 HMA (~1559/oz) which did cap gains in the yellow metal during yesterday’s session. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices found an overnight base around 2.8/lb but ultimately remains flat intraday.</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister states that oil market stability is guaranteed by OPEC+, thus oil prices barely reacted to the Libyan supply disruption.

Italy’s FTSE MIB (-0.6%) lags its peers with the Italian Banking Index hitting 6-week lows – on the back of Di Maio’s resignation as the Italian 5SM leader. On the other end of the spectrum, SMI (+0.6%) outperforms with almost all of its stocks in positive territory. Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the overall market sentiment. In terms of individual movers, Airbus (+1.7%) shares are supported after a source noted that Boeing doesn’t expect regulators to sign off on the 737 Max until June or July, months later than the manufacturer previously expected. Traders also attribute the losses in Tui (-4.3%) to the Boeing news. Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.7%) reversed opening gains on the back of another profit warning in which it expects FY19 results to be below forecasts, with the return on sales of Mercedes-Benz vans also forecast below prior guidance. Meanwhile, ASML (-1.2%) shrugged off a mostly in-line earnings report and a EUR 6bln share buy-back programme, potentially on concerns that the Co. may not completed this programme given that the FY19 share buy-back was incomplete.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>CHF/EUR - Although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China’s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday’s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning?</p><p>JPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD - The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday’s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs. Elsewhere, Sterling is rangy in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms either side of 1.3050 and 0.8500 awaiting Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs that could well be the final jigsaw pieces for next week’s BoE policy meeting, and similarly the Loonie is biding time between 1.3050-1.3100 in the run up to Canadian CPI just before the BoC.</p><p>EM - The Rand continues its recovery from worst levels after in line SA CPI and last week’s surprise SARB ease prompted Usd/Zar upside to test the 200 DMA yesterday, but also as the Dollar stalls after another look at the same DXY chart resistance level around 97.720. However, the Rouble is fading after a fleeting relief rally on the formation of a new Russian Government alongside oil prices towards 62.0000 again.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Gilts appear to have led the latest recovery leg in mainstream debt, but Bunds were first to bounce from worst levels and not just due to the fact that Liife gets under way hours after Eurex. However, more upbeat UK macro news via the latest CBI industrial trends survey has nudged the 10 year benchmark off its 133.73 perch in contrast to its German peer that just rebounded to 172.43 and a fresh intraday/multi-week peak despite an even more emphatic/impressive revival in BTPs of over 1 full point from the depths, albeit still underwater. Elsewhere, a rather begrudging/reluctant grind higher in US Treasuries ahead of housing data and into key/psychological levels, like 129-20 in the 10 year note future/1.75% cash yield.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures remain lacklustre in mid-week trade – with participants pointing dampened sentiment on the coronavirus outbreak alongside demand woes for the complex, amid lower demand from airlines in light of cancelled flights ahead of the Chinese Lunar Year. Bearish supply-side fundamentals also weigh on the futures as EIA expects US total shale oil production to rise by 22k BPD in February to 9.2mln, with a predominant increase by the Permian. <strong>WTI</strong> meanders around USD 58/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.57/bbl and the 100 DMA at 57.29, whilst the <strong>Brent</strong> contract fell below its 100 DMA (62.79/bbl) with eyes on its 200 DMA at 63.97/bbl as Mar’20 futures test yesterday’s low just above 64/bbl. As a reminder, the weekly API Private crude inventories will be released later today on account of Monday’s MLK US market holiday. <strong>Spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> prices have clambered off overnight lows after a test of the 1550/oz to the downside and ahead of potential modest resistance at its 50 HMA (~1559/oz) which did cap gains in the yellow metal during yesterday’s session. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices found an overnight base around 2.8/lb but ultimately remains flat intraday.</p>",

However, more upbeat UK macro news via the latest CBI industrial trends survey has nudged the 10 year benchmark off its 133.73 perch in contrast to its German peer that just rebounded to 172.43 and a fresh intraday/multi-week peak despite an even more emphatic/impressive revival in BTPs of over 1 full point from the depths, albeit still underwater. Elsewhere, a rather begrudging/reluctant grind higher in US Treasuries ahead of housing data and into key/psychological levels, like 129-20 in the 10 year note future/1.75% cash yield.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China’s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday’s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning?</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday’s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs. Elsewhere, Sterling is rangy in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms either side of 1.3050 and 0.8500 awaiting Friday’s preliminary UK PMIs that could well be the final jigsaw pieces for next week’s BoE policy meeting, and similarly the Loonie is biding time between 1.3050-1.3100 in the run up to Canadian CPI just before the BoC.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand continues its recovery from worst levels after in line SA CPI and last week’s surprise SARB ease prompted Usd/Zar upside to test the 200 DMA yesterday, but also as the Dollar stalls after another look at the same <strong>DXY</strong> chart resistance level around 97.720. However, the Rouble is fading after a fleeting relief rally on the formation of a new Russian Government alongside oil prices towards 62.0000 again.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*THE LATEST:</strong> China National Health Commission (NHC) Vice Minister Li announced 440 confirmed cases in 13 provinces and 9 deaths (Prev. 6) have been confirmed from the coronavirus as of January 21st. There were comments from China Disease Control Center chief Gao that the new coronavirus is adapting and mutating.</p><p>US Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of coronavirus for the US in Washington state, while it also noted that there are active conversations regarding vaccines and diagnostics for the Wuhan Coronavirus with the National Institutes of Health.</p><p><strong>*MARKET RELEVANCE:</strong> Markets have been using the spread of the coronavirus as justification for recent pullbacks in stocks and energy. Areas subjected to Asia, travel, healthcare and oil have been afflicted - but desks note that the developments are not currently thought to be a macro issue.</p><ul><li>Healthcare names, particularly in Asia, have been supported by the spread</li><li>Airline stocks have been weighed on as flights see cancellations, predominantly ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year – seen as the largest human migration event of the year</li><li>Energy is pressured amid concerns surrounding the global growth aspect alongside demand woes as airlines see cancelled flights</li></ul><p>As the virus spread to the US, analysts at CapEco are adamant that US travel and retails sales will be hit as much as the 2003 SARS epidemic, primarily as the mortality rate for the coronavirus appears to be significantly lower than SARS. “The upshot is that even if this first isolated case of the Wuhan virus in the US develops into a full-scale epidemic, which is unlikely, we wouldn't expect it to have a significant negative impact on economic activity.” – CapEco concludes.</p><p>Desks have suggested that the virus might result in profit-taking ahead of China's Lunar New Year holidays, beginning Friday. There is no certainty about what the impact could be on growth metrics, but a downward bias has been assumed (the SARS epidemic of 2003 is believed to have taken 0.15ppts off global growth that year). One implication may be that traders also dismiss any optimistic survey data that is released in the weeks' ahead, since it would not include the impact of the virus. Indeed, crude desks have suggested that the outbreak might provide a negative shock to global oil demand, perhaps to the tune of around 260k BPD, and this demand hit may outweigh concerns on the supply front, according to Goldman Sachs. For the fixed income markets and the USD, UBS thinks the bias lends to lower Treasury yields and a higher dollar in the near-term.</p><p><strong>*MEASURES:</strong> In an attempt to tackle the outbreak, China is poised to start nationwide screenings. The China National Health Commission said Wuhan City (the origin of the outbreak) is to establish a daily communication system and that China has banned live animals including poultry from entering Wuhan. Officials are also boosting the monitoring of transportation links, according to the China NHC.</p><p>Furthermore, NHC said there has been effective work on tracking the origin of the virus and that there is no evidence so far of super spreaders.</p><p>The World Health Organisation is to conduct an emergency meeting later today (time TBC) to assess the severity of the virus and provide an update on its classification.</p><p>Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel or trade due to the virus.</p>",

The overall mood in financial markets has turned from relatively high anxiety over the potential impact of China’s deadly virus to comparative calm and this has sapped some strength from safe havens, for now at least. On the domestic front, PSNB and PSNCR balances for December are up before January CBI industrial trends, but neither look as pivotal for next week’s BoE policy meeting than Friday’s flash PMIs after a spate of mainly weak releases, bar the aforementioned more upbeat labour report.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> was subdued after the recent pullback from resistance around its 200-hour MA and failure to hold on to 1.1100 handle, while the tailwinds in <strong>GBP/USD</strong> from stronger than expected jobs data has faded and the pair meandered around 1.3050 where there is a minor option expiry set for today’s New York cut. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> recouped some of its losses to briefly reclaim the 110.00 handle, while antipodeans were pressured amid the underperformance in China and following a weaker CNY reference rate setting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude future slightly pressured to briefly re-approach the USD 58.00/bbl level to the downside amid early coronavirus-related jitters and with Goldman Sachs suggesting a potential USD 3/bbl drop in oil prices if the virus plays out similar to SARS which could reduce global demand by 260k bpd largely due to reduced jet fuel demand. In addition, focus for the complex now shift to the latest stockpile numbers with the holiday-delayed private sector inventory report due later. <strong>Gold</strong> prices were pressured overnight amid mild gains in the greenback and the overnight recovery in sentiment which also provided some reprieve for <strong>copper</strong> prices to reclaim the USD 2.80/lb level.</p><p>US total shale regions oil production in February expected +22k BPD at 9.2mln BPD, according to EIA.

The heavy slate of corporate issuance did little to shake the complex either, with supply especially notable from financials after earnings have cleared. There was also some chunky USD issuance from Pemex (USD 5bln, 2-parter; books said to be around USD 25bln) as well as Saudi Arabia (USD 5bln, 3-parter, due Thursday). At settlement, the curve had bull-flattened, with yields down around 3.5bps in the front-end of the curve, and lower by over 6bps in the long-end.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed after the lacklustre lead from Wall St, where all major indices snapped their streak of record closes amid jitters related to the coronavirus with 440 cases reported in China and the death toll now at 9, while the CDC also confirmed the first case of the virus in the US. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) managed to rebound from opening weakness with outperformance in Consumer Staples and Healthcare underpinning the Australian benchmark to a fresh all-time high, while Tokyo sentiment has mainly been driven by currency moves but with gains capped by weakness in automakers including Mitsubishi Motors after several of its locations were raided in Germany on suspicion of using illegal emission cheating devices. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) attempts to nurse some of the prior day’s near-3% losses and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) is the worst performer as it slips to its lowest levels so far this year due to the ongoing outbreak fears and with experts also suggesting there is a possibility the coronavirus could mutate.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer and has extended on the prior day’s highs amid lacklustre trade in most its counterparts and the ongoing developments in Washington where the Republican-controlled Senate have stuck to party lines and blocked several proposals by Senate Democrat Leader Schumer to subpoena further evidence for the Trump impeachment trial. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is subdued after the recent pullback from resistance around its 200-hour MA and failure to hold on to 1.1100 handle, while the tailwinds in GBP/USD from stronger than expected jobs data has faded with the pair meandering around 1.3050 where there is a minor option expiry set for today’s New York cut. USD/JPY has recouped some of its losses in a reclaim of the 110.00 handle, while antipodeans are pressured amid underperformance in China and following a weaker CNY reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are indecisive as T-notes retrace some of the prior day’s advances after hitting resistance around 129.20 and with participants sidelined heading into the enhanced-liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p>",
