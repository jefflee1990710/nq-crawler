The German manufacturing component which came in at an abysmal 44.7, below the expected 48.0, “The downturn in Germany’s manufacturing sector has become more entrenched, with March’s flash data showing accelerated declines in output, new orders and exports. Uncertainty towards Brexit and US-China trade relations, a slowdown in the car industry and generally softer global demand all continue to weigh heavily on the performance of the manufacturing sector, which is now registering the steepest rate of contraction since 2012.”</p><p><strong>* US PMI: </strong>After weak Eurozone PMIs, traders were far more attentive to the Markit US PMIs than usual. The manufacturing PMI came in at 52.5, below the expected 53.6 and the previous 53.0. “US businesses reported a softer end to the first quarter, with output growth easing to the second lowest recorded over the last year. The PMI survey data nevertheless remain encouragingly resilient … suggesting some potential upside to many current growth forecasts,” economists at IHS market comment. The US services PMI also missed. “A gap has opened up between the manufacturing and service sectors, however, with goods-producers and exporters struggling amid a deteriorating external environment and concerns regarding the impact of trade wars. The survey is consistent with the official measure of manufacturing production falling at an increased rate in March and hence acting as a drag on the economy in the first quarter,” the economist adds.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed Board of Governors nominee <strong>Moore</strong> told BBG TV that he was not sure if the Fed should be cutting rates now, noting that deflation can be as harmful for an economy as inflation, but he was more worried about deflation and that raising rates could cause deflation. He said that the Fed's move in December was a very substantial mistake, and he was thankful it reversed course. Moore considers himself a growth hawk, and said sound monpol with stable prices can lead to strong growth; he said it was possible to see 3-4% growth per annum in the long-term. On the currency, Moore said he was an advocate of a stable dollar. Moore admitted he needed to do more research on BSN, though he stated his intention was to reduce the balance sheet. Finally, he quoted US President Trump as saying he was confident that a trade deal can be reached with China, and he was also confident. Elsewhere, 2019 voter <strong>Bullard </strong>gave an interview to the WSJ, where he said Q1 weakness would be transitory. On the yield curve -- an issue Bullard has warned on in the past --&nbsp; he said that the inversion was notable, but any inversion must be sustained in order to have any economic importance. Unsurprisingly, Bullard added that he sees no need for any rate moves at this point.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer will visit Beijing at the end of next week for further trade talks. The language from the Trump administration remains constructive, with the President on Friday stating that a trade deal was close. Following the US delegation’s visit to Beijing, China’s Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington in April to conclude negotiations, China’s MOFCOM said. Trump has this week threatened to keep tariffs on China long after a trade deal, as he wants to see evidence that the Chinese are playing fair, and any deal is enforced sufficiently: “We’re not talking about removing them, we’re talking about leaving them for a substantial period of time, because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal,” Trump said this week; the Chinese have reportedly wanted the tariffs to be lifted immediately; the China Global Times editor, often seen as a mouth piece for the Chinese state, said China would not accept the US keeping tariffs on, while China has removed them, saying that it leaves China with no option to “hit back.” Bloomberg reported that the goal was to reach an agreement in the days after Liu He’s visit, potentially capped-off with a meeting between Trump/Xi at Mar-a-Lago. While a lot of the news flow tends to focus on the more challenging aspects of the talks, Politico reported that a China deal remains very close and the Beijing trip next week is largely ceremonial, in order for China feel they are being respected by an equal amount of visits, and a deal is still planned to be signed off by Trump and Xi and Mar-a-Lago at the end of April.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Even by Westminster’s standards, this week was a chaotic one for UK politics as PM May continued to face further headwinds in her battle to secure the nation’s departure from the EU. The PM was rocked in the early stages of last week after House Speaker Bercow’s decision to block MV3 on the basis that no changes had been made to the existing deal. As such, given the political stalemate, May had no choice but to go to the EU Council looking to secure an extension to Article 50. With a longer extension to Brexit seemingly impossible for the PM to request given the potential Brexiteer backlash from within her own party. As such, attention turned towards the likelihood of a shorter extension. PM May opted to seek for a delay until June 30th, however, this was met with a particularly divided response from the EU with some members of the Union concerned about the ramifications for EU elections which are due to take place on May 23rd. With this in mind, the EU summit final communique stated that EU leaders will give the UK an extension until May 22nd if HoC agrees to the deal next week, otherwise it will give the UK until April 12th to indicate a way forward if the deal is rejected, while the EU reiterated its stance that the WA cannot be renegotiated. As such, despite Speaker of the House Bercow’s decision last week to block MV3, pressure from the EU looks like he will have to inevitably reverse his position and offer UK lawmakers another opportunity to vote on May’s deal. That said, despite the severity of the situation, there is little to indicate that PM May will be able to overturn the 149 vote defeat she suffered last time around.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD AT USD /BBL, BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD AT USD /BBL. </strong>The crude complex suffered from the risk off sentiment to end the week, falling for a second day, despite a lack of energy-specific catalysts. The sell-off was initiated by a disappointing German manufacturing PMI release, exacerbated by a disappointing US figure, reigniting global growth fears. In addition, the lack of progress on a Sino-US trade deal is still hanging over the market, with many attributing this to why this week’s inventory draws (record beating for a time of year when builds are the norm) failed to sustain a rally with crude now down on the week despite reaching YTD earlier on. In supply newsflow: Nigerian exports are due to fall in May to 740k BPD from 853k BPD in April, according to preliminary programmes; Exxon’s (XOM) Baytown refinery (584k BPD) unit is said to be undergoing several months of fire repair. The Baker Hughes Rig Count saw rigs being cut for the fifth straight week, with oil down 9 at 824, nat. gas down 1 at 192 and total down 10 at 1006.</p><p><strong>* SPX -1.90% at 2801, NDX -2.23% at 7326, DJI -1.77% at 25503. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -2.62%, Materials -2.98%, Industrials -2.27%, Cons Discretionary -2.05%, Cons Staples -0.24%, Healthcare -1.79%, Financials -2.77%, Tech -2.34%, Telecoms -1.26%, Utilities +0.69%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Nike<strong> </strong>(NKE) traded at the bottom of the Dow to end the week on disappointing revenue; sports apparel distributor Foot Locker (FL) took its cues. Tiffany (TIF) initially got off on a back-foot after reporting revenue below expectations, but then reversed course to become an outperformer on constructive guidance. A large drop in yields saw the banking sector suffer with stocks such as Citi (C), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) all underperforming. The risk off sentiment weighed into cyclical sectors such as tech, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Micron Technology (MU), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX) all traded in the red. Best Buy (BBY) and Lumentum (LITE) benefitted from upgrades at Oppenheimer and JPMorgan respectively. 3M (MMM) suffered from a pessimistic outlook provided by Morgan Stanley. Booking Holdings (BKNG) dipped on the back of a downgrade at Wedbush. Avon Products (AVP) surged following reports of a sale which would re-combine its units. Fidelity (FIS) caught a tailwind from being added to Wedbush’s “Best Ideas” list. Goldcorp (GG) dipped after Newmont (NEM) investor Paulson &amp; Co. opposed the merger deal. Tesla (TSLA) traded lower on the back of Cowen lowering its price target. Blackrock (BLK) rocked over on the announcement of a chunky fintech acquisition. Papa John’s (PZZA) caught a bid after it appointed NBA legend Shaq to its board of directors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 21+ TICKS HIGHER AT 124-01. </strong>The Tplex traded in a narrow range in the Asian session before a wave of buyers came into the market on the back of a risk off sentiment becoming catalysed by a big drop in German manufacturing, the lowest since 2012, the move was exacerbated by the US missing PMI expectations too. Friday also saw the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverting, triggering algos to rotate out of equities and into bonds, as well as catching traders’ attention, and stoking fears about the health of the US economy, since an inverted 3m/10yr curve usually portends recession, analysts said. However, FOMC arch dove Bullard – who has vigorously warned against inversions in the past – said that it would only be a real concern if the inversion was sustained. Into settlement, Treasuries came off their highs slightly, but the rally remained intact, with the yields of the belly falling by c. 10bps; the 2s/5s contracted by 1.1bps, whilst the 5s/30s steepened by 1.2bps.</p><p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The Dollar is back under pressure in wake of softer than consensus US Markit PMIs, with the index retesting its 30 DMA (96.652), but still well off the lows posted after Wednesday’s dovish Fed and actually very close to where it started the week. To recap, the FOMC matched market expectations and more by removing all hikes for the remainder of this year having previously plotted 2, while also confirming that the pace of balance sheet run-offs will slow and QT to end sooner than originally planned (starting in May and stopping in September vs end 2019). However, the DXY has rebounded relatively sharply from 95.740 at worst on a mixture of risk-off positioning and gains made at the expense of rivals for other/specific reasons.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency looks set to end Friday’s EU session at its worst levels of the week vs the Usd and most G10 counterparts, bar the more risk sensitive of high beta currencies, and the catalyst or rather catalysts were clearly the March Eurozone preliminary PMIs, and in particular much worse than forecast manufacturing readings showing Germany contracting faster, France tipping into negative territory and the pan-Eurozone headline further below the 50 threshold as a result. Hence, Eur/Usd is currently around 1.1280 vs a high very near 1.1450 and circa 1.1320 at the beginning of the week. Note also, ECB President Draghi is reported to have sounded pretty downbeat when addressing EU leaders as he noted protracted weakness and pervasive weakness in the EZ economy.</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>In stark contrast to the Euro, and all major peers, the Yen’s safe-haven allure propelled it to fresh weekly peaks vs the Greenback, as clustered bids in Usd/Jpy between 110.05-00 were filled and the headline pair declined through 110.00 to almost 109.90. This compares to a high of roughly 111.70 and ‘open’ at 111.45, with a serious of technical supports breached and very big option expiries along the way. In terms of fundamentals and other factors, the BoJ underlined dovish leanings as some members threw doubt over reaching the 2% inflation target by 2021 and Governor Kuroda reiterated that more easing could be implemented if the economy and CPI lost momentum. However, the principle themes impacting were risk aversion and the JGB/UST yield differential that narrowed post-Fed, but much more prominently over the last session of the week when core bonds caught a significant bid (10 year Treasury below 2.50%, German Bund sub-zero and UK Gilt down to 1%).</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Another topsy-turvy week for Sterling largely in line with Brexit twists and turns, as even top-tier UK data failed to divert attention for more than an instant irrespective of the outcome. In short, after last week’s Parliament votes resulted in a 2nd rejection of PM May’s deal and no deal, but approved an Article 50 extension an official request was sent from 10 Downing Street to the EU for a delay from March 29 to at least June 30. However, following a meeting in Brussels this was unanimously turned down in favour of a conditional postponement to April 12 and/or May 22 (deadline day for EU elections and a day before the event itself respectively), with the caveat that the HoC finally back the WA at MV3 expected to take place next week. On that note, support still looks set to fall short and Parliament will also be taking indicative votes on 7 alternative options if it turns out to be 3 blanks out of 3. Nevertheless, the Pound has drawn some comfort from the fact that the prospect of a cliff edge departure has been pushed forward from next Friday, even though this may prove to be just delaying the inevitable of possibility of that scenario via a can kick, with Cable holding just under 1.3200 within a 1.3310-1.3000 approximate range.</p><p><strong>* CAD/AUD/NZD: </strong>The Loonie has endured another roller-coaster ride, and not so much on the fluctuations in crude prices, but more in tune with technical and its US rival’s fortunes. However, Usd/Cad is well above troughs just shy of 1.3250 and closer to the 1.3425 apex on the aforementioned risk-off tone to end the week, and with sub-consensus Canadian retail sales offsetting mildly firmer than estimated inflation. Similarly, the Aussie is on the backfoot having failed to sustain 0.7100 or ground above the round number amidst the downturn in sentiment and losses relative to its Antipodean neighbour as Aud/Nzd reversed through 1.0300 and the Kiwi clung closer to 0.6900 vs the US Dollar post- in line q/q NZ Q4 GDP and pre-next week’s RBNZ.</p><p><strong>* NOK/SEK/CHF: </strong>All down vs the Usd, but mixed vs the Eur as the Scandi Crowns lose bullish chart and Central Bank momentum on the wave of pre-weekend risk paring, but the Franc appreciates towards 1.1200 as it benefits from its status a non-Euro EU safe-haven. This, despite the SNB maintaining NIRP and the threat of intervention given a still highly valued assessment of the Chf, while the Nok and Sek unwound gains made after the Norges Bank’s hawkish hike and latest Riksbank rhetoric playing down recent benign Swedish inflation prints.</p><p><strong>* EM: </strong>As usual during flights to quality, regional currencies and assets are major underperformers, but with Turkish-US relations strained again the Lira really tanked, as Usd/Try soared to 5.7400+ from 5.4460 at one stage. Note also, the CBRT’s unexpected decision to pull weekly FX repos piled more pressure on the Lira as some speculated that this could lead to a 150 bp rise in funding costs.</p><p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> <strong>Monday:</strong> US New Home Sales, Apple Event. <strong>Tuesday:</strong> US Durable Goods, US Case Shiller, US Consumer Confidence. <strong>Wednesday:</strong> RBNZ. <strong>Thursday:</strong> SARB Rate Decision, US GDP (final), UK Nationwide House Price, Eurozone Consumer Confidence (final), US Pending Home Sales, Banxico Rate Decision, Japan Labour Report &amp; Retail Sales. <strong>Friday:</strong> UK GDP, US PCE, Canada GDP, Uni of Michigan (final). <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21444/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p><p><strong>* Central Bank Weekly:</strong> Reviewing Fed, Norges, BOE, SNB, BCB; previewing RBNZ, SARB, Banxico. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21445/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p>",

The sell-off was initiated by a disappointing German manufacturing PMI release, exacerbated by a disappointing US figure, reigniting global growth fears. In addition, the lack of progress on a Sino-US trade deal is still hanging over the market, with many attributing this to why this week’s inventory draws (record beating for a time of year when builds are the norm) failed to sustain a rally with crude now down on the week despite reaching YTD earlier on. In supply newsflow: Nigerian exports are due to fall in May to 740k BPD from 853k BPD in April, according to preliminary programmes; Exxon’s (XOM) Baytown refinery (584k BPD) unit is said to be undergoing several months of fire repair. The Baker Hughes Rig Count saw rigs being cut for the fifth straight week, with oil down 9 at 824, nat. gas down 1 at 192 and total down 10 at 1006.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar is back under pressure in wake of softer than consensus US Markit PMIs, with the index retesting its 30 DMA (96.652), but still well off the lows posted after Wednesday’s dovish Fed and actually very close to where it started the week. To recap, the FOMC matched market expectations and more by removing all hikes for the remainder of this year having previously plotted 2, while also confirming that the pace of balance sheet run-offs will slow and QT to end sooner than originally planned (starting in May and stopping in September vs end 2019). However, the DXY has rebounded relatively sharply from 95.740 at worst on a mixture of risk-off positioning and gains made at the expense of rivals for other/specific reasons.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency looks set to end Friday’s EU session at its worst levels of the week vs the Usd and most G10 counterparts, bar the more risk sensitive of high beta currencies, and the catalyst or rather catalysts were clearly the March Eurozone preliminary PMIs, and in particular much worse than forecast manufacturing readings showing Germany contracting faster, France tipping into negative territory and the pan-Eurozone headline further below the 50 threshold as a result. Hence, Eur/Usd is currently around 1.1280 vs a high very near 1.1450 and circa 1.1320 at the beginning of the week. Note also, ECB President Draghi is reported to have sounded pretty downbeat when addressing EU leaders as he noted protracted weakness and pervasive weakness in the EZ economy.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to the Euro, and all major peers, the Yen’s safe-haven allure propelled it to fresh weekly peaks vs the Greenback, as clustered bids in Usd/Jpy between 110.05-00 were filled and the headline pair declined through 110.00 to almost 109.90. This compares to a high of roughly 111.70 and ‘open’ at 111.45, with a serious of technical supports breached and very big option expiries along the way. In terms of fundamentals and other factors, the BoJ underlined dovish leanings as some members threw doubt over reaching the 2% inflation target by 2021 and Governor Kuroda reiterated that more easing could be implemented if the economy and CPI lost momentum. However, the principle themes impacting were risk aversion and the JGB/UST yield differential that narrowed post-Fed, but much more prominently over the last session of the week when core bonds caught a significant bid (10 year Treasury below 2.50%, German Bund sub-zero and UK Gilt down to 1%).</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Another topsy-turvy week for Sterling largely in line with Brexit twists and turns, as even top-tier UK data failed to divert attention for more than an instant irrespective of the outcome. In short, after last week’s Parliament votes resulted in a 2nd rejection of PM May’s deal and no deal, but approved an Article 50 extension an official request was sent from 10 Downing Street to the EU for a delay from March 29 to at least June 30. However, following a meeting in Brussels this was unanimously turned down in favour of a conditional postponement to April 12 and/or May 22 (deadline day for EU elections and a day before the event itself respectively), with the caveat that the HoC finally back the WA at MV3 expected to take place next week. On that note, support still looks set to fall short and Parliament will also be taking indicative votes on 7 alternative options if it turns out to be 3 blanks out of 3. Nevertheless, the Pound has drawn some comfort from the fact that the prospect of a cliff edge departure has been pushed forward from next Friday, even though this may prove to be just delaying the inevitable of possibility of that scenario via a can kick, with Cable holding just under 1.3200 within a 1.3310-1.3000 approximate range.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Loonie has endured another roller-coaster ride, and not so much on the fluctuations in crude prices, but more in tune with technical and its US rival’s fortunes. However, Usd/Cad is well above troughs just shy of 1.3250 and closer to the 1.3425 apex on the aforementioned risk-off tone to end the week, and with sub-consensus Canadian retail sales offsetting mildly firmer than estimated inflation. Similarly, the Aussie is on the backfoot having failed to sustain 0.7100 or ground above the round number amidst the downturn in sentiment and losses relative to its Antipodean neighbour as Aud/Nzd reversed through 1.0300 and the Kiwi clung closer to 0.6900 vs the US Dollar post- in line q/q NZ Q4 GDP and pre-next week’s RBNZ.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All down vs the Usd, but mixed vs the Eur as the Scandi Crowns lose bullish chart and Central Bank momentum on the wave of pre-weekend risk paring, but the Franc appreciates towards 1.1200 as it benefits from its status a non-Euro EU safe-haven. This, despite the SNB maintaining NIRP and the threat of intervention given a still highly valued assessment of the Chf, while the Nok and Sek unwound gains made after the Norges Bank’s hawkish hike and latest Riksbank rhetoric playing down recent benign Swedish inflation prints.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>As usual during flights to quality, regional currencies and assets are major underperformers, but with Turkish-US relations strained again the Lira really tanked, as Usd/Try soared to 5.7400+ from 5.4460 at one stage. Note also, the CBRT’s unexpected decision to pull weekly FX repos piled more pressure on the Lira as some speculated that this could lead to a 150 bp rise in funding costs.</p>",

On the day of the FOMC, Nomura says that selling equities for profit taking by global macro HFs and equity long/short funds was noticeable, but the US stock market printed a sharp recovery on Thursday. Regarding major factor-returns, the momentum and growth names kept their leading role in the stock market rally, Nomura says.</li><li>The bank says the risk-on trend since early March has been underpinned by: 1) the rollback of US political uncertainties, which has a positive effect on buying momentum stocks; 2) The Fed's dovish pivot has a positive effect on buying growth stocks.</li><li>Nomura now thinks that the attention of spec accounts will turn to US-China trade talks: \"While most pay attention to the headlines related to US-China negotiations, they are prioritising an attempt to make up for lost ground in their performance (versus market indices) caused by their being late to buy US equities, as they expect the Fed's policy stance to provide strong support to the stock market.\"</li><li>Nomura argues that CTAs face a similar situation: \"According to Nomura's real-time estimates, CTAs seem to have ended their profit-taking phase and resumed buying stock futures in S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ-100. Technicals-based trend followers are likely to make short-term buying decisions.\" Fundamentals-based investors appear to have maintained their prudent stance because US stock prices are at relatively high-level and perspectives for US corporate earnings are sluggish, Nomura says, \"S&amp;P500 will likely be a mix of selling and buying but maintain its upward momentum unless VIX rises above ~15.\"</li><li>With regards to volatility, equity market vol measured by the VVIX tends to tentatively rise from mid-April as a seasonal pattern,\" Nomura observes, and therefore, a one-month holding period would be appropriate when entering long position and aiming for capital gains in US equity market at this moment, Nomura wrote.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<ul><li>After a more dovish than expected FOMC, stocks have rallied. On the day of the FOMC, Nomura says that selling equities for profit taking by global macro HFs and equity long/short funds was noticeable, but the US stock market printed a sharp recovery on Thursday. Regarding major factor-returns, the momentum and growth names kept their leading role in the stock market rally, Nomura says.</li><li>The bank says the risk-on trend since early March has been underpinned by: 1) the rollback of US political uncertainties, which has a positive effect on buying momentum stocks; 2) The Fed's dovish pivot has a positive effect on buying growth stocks.</li><li>Nomura now thinks that the attention of spec accounts will turn to US-China trade talks: \"While most pay attention to the headlines related to US-China negotiations, they are prioritising an attempt to make up for lost ground in their performance (versus market indices) caused by their being late to buy US equities, as they expect the Fed's policy stance to provide strong support to the stock market.\"</li><li>Nomura argues that CTAs face a similar situation: \"According to Nomura's real-time estimates, CTAs seem to have ended their profit-taking phase and resumed buying stock futures in S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ-100. Technicals-based trend followers are likely to make short-term buying decisions.\" Fundamentals-based investors appear to have maintained their prudent stance because US stock prices are at relatively high-level and perspectives for US corporate earnings are sluggish, Nomura says, \"S&amp;P500 will likely be a mix of selling and buying but maintain its upward momentum unless VIX rises above ~15.\"</li><li>With regards to volatility, equity market vol measured by the VVIX tends to tentatively rise from mid-April as a seasonal pattern,\" Nomura observes, and therefore, a one-month holding period would be appropriate when entering long position and aiming for capital gains in US equity market at this moment, Nomura wrote.</li></ul>",

Elsewhere, PVM note that the USD 70/bbl threshold remains elusive for Brent, which notched a 2019 high of USD 68.69/bbl recently; PVM highlight that the complex is generally stagnant awaiting a strong catalyst, likely in the form of a US-China trade agreement.</p><p>Gold (+0.3%) benefitted from the negative diversion in market sentiment, with the yellow metal trading at the top of its USD 8/oz range at around USD 1313/oz.

Eur/Usd was already on the retreat from near 1.1400 highs, but then lost the 1.1300 handle before finding some support and underlying bids, while Eur/Gbp reversed course from 0.8680+ towards 0.8600 even though the Pound also weakened in sympathy, not to mention ongoing/heightened Brexit uncertainty.</p><p><strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc has benefited from the Euro’s demise with the cross down near the middle of a 1.1300-1.1230 range, but is losing out vs the Greenback as Usd/Chf bounces from 0.9915 lows to 0.9970 and the <strong>DXY </strong>hits new post-Fed recovery peaks just over 96.800 given the Eur’s heavy weighting in the basket.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD</strong></p><p>All losing out to their US peer as the overall risk tone sours on the back of the aforementioned bleak EZ surveys, with Aud/Usd back under 0.7100, Usd/Cad close to the top of a 1.3385-50 band and Nzd/Usd also relinquishing its big figure+ status (0.6900) forged after solid NZ Q4 q/q GDP earlier this week.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>As noted above, Sterling has suffered a bout of Euro contagion with Cable slipping from 1.3150+ to sub-1.3100 at one stage having derived a degree of comfort from breathing space afforded by the EU on Article 50, albeit still aware that this could just be a stay of Brexicution if UK PM May fails to convince a majority in Parliament to back the WA again.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Also victims of the current bout of broad risk aversion, and unwinding recent outperformance even against the Eur. In fact, Eur/Nok has bounced relatively firmly from Thursday’s near 9.5900 lows irrespective of Norges Bank rhetoric reinforcing the hawkish hike, while Eur/Sek is currently hovering around 10.4700 within 10.4960-4250 parameters.

As such, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.5%)</strong> was positive as tech names tracked the upside of their US counterparts and with broad strength seen across sectors aside from the mining names amid a subdued metals complex, while attempts by the <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.1%)</strong> to play catch up to the prior day’s Fed-inspired performance was cut short by recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.4%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%)</strong> were negative with focus in China centred on earnings releases including Tencent and PetroChina which both fell short of net profit estimates and resulted in the latter leading the declines in Hong Kong. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with prices boosted in the wake of the dovish Fed and as longer-term yields dropped to multi-year lows last seen in late 2016.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a weekly net injection of CNY 90bln vs. Prev.

(Newswires)</p><p>EU's Tusk said a cliff edge will be avoided and that all options for the UK are still open until April 12. <strong>Tusk added that a long extension will become impossible if UK has not decided by April 12th</strong>, while EU's Juncker said there is no more we can give the UK and that we are ready for a no-deal with emergency measures in place.

(Telegraph)</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> was subdued overnight below the 96.50 level as the prior day’s recovery from the post-FOMC selling eventually lost steam. This provided much needed reprieve for <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which had been at the whim of the Brexit-related risks and helped the latter reclaim the 1.3100 handle. In terms of the latest developments in the Brexit saga, the EU have agreed to a 2-tier extension for Article 50 which will be pushed back until May 22nd if parliament agrees to the deal next week, otherwise it will give the UK until April 12th to indicate a way forward if the deal is rejected. Following the summit, EU’s Tusk commented that a cliff edge will be avoided and that he was much more optimistic, although some market watchers were less enthusiastic and viewed this as kicking the can down the road with Europe steadfast in its unwillingness to budge on the WA. In addition, JP Morgan adjusted its outcome probabilities and now sees a UK general election as the most likely scenario with a 30% probability (Prev. 15%), while it assigned a 20% chance for exiting with a deal (Prev. 35%) and 20% likelihood for an extension without no political process (Prev. 20%). Elsewhere, antipodeans were rangebound as <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated in the aftermath of this week’s Fed and data-induced fluctuations, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were tentative amid the mixed overnight risk tone.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were virtually unchanged overnight and have stabilized from the post-FOMC fluctuations with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures flat near the USD 60/bbl level amid a lack of overnight catalysts and an indecisive risk tone.

Some desks noted that after the aggressive post-Fed buying on Wednesday, more measured trading was to be expected, and the buying was most likely short-covering, and with fewer shorts, the buyside action was naturally more subdued. It is interesting that the effective Fed Funds Rate rose 1bps today to 2.41%, vs 2.40% over the last few weeks, with 2s yields trading below that level for a lot of the session, while the Fed Funds Rate eclipsed the IOER for the first time since the rate was launched in 2008. There was also a lot of attention on the 3-month/10-year spread, which was compressed to just 3.9bps at one point on Thursday (folks look at this spread as a more accurate gauge of recession risks, rather than 2s10s). Mortgage rates also dropped, helping some of the homebuilding names. The Treasury's sale of USD 11bln of 10-year TIPS was soft, tailing 1.1bps; the internals provided some encouragement, with the indirect participation jumping to 77% from 69%, pushing direct buyers participation lower. Going forward, some expect that, given G10 central banks aren't likely to all follow the Norges Bank higher, Treasuries could still be attractive to yield-hunters. Next week, the Treasury will auction USD 113bln in 2s/5s/7s, sizes unchanged vs the priors. US T-note futures (M9) settled 1+ ticks lower at 123-11+</p><p><strong>US President Trump said Fed Chair Powell was wrong to project diminishing growth in the US and stated we are not slowing</strong>, while he added that if it wasn't for Powell's mistakes, 2018 growth could have exceeded 4% instead of 3% and that he hopes he did not influence Fed decisions.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed with the region failing to take full impetus from the tech advances on Wall St, where the sector rose by nearly 2.5% in the S&amp;P 500 as Micron shares surged over 9% post-earnings and with Apple shares the best performer in the DJIA on bullish broker calls. As such, ASX 200 (+0.5%) is positive with tech names tracking the upside of their US counterparts and with broad strength seen across sectors aside from the mining names amid a subdued metals complex, while attempts by the Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) to play catch up to the prior day’s Fed-inspired performance on return from holiday was cut short by recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) are also indecisive with focus in China centred on earnings releases including Tencent and PetroChina with the latter the laggard in Hong Kong after it missed forecasts for FY18 net.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is subdued overnight and back below the 96.50 level as the prior day’s recovery from the post-FOMC selling eventually lost steam, to provide much needed reprieve for its major counterparts across the pond which had been under the whim of the Brexit-related risks. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are off their lows in which the latter reclaimed the 1.3100 handle, and in the latest developments in the Brexit saga, the EU have agreed to a 2-tier extension for Article 50 until May 22nd if parliament agrees to the deal next week or otherwise it will give the UK until April 12th to indicate a way forward if the deal is rejected. Following the summit, EU’s Tusk commented that a cliff edge will be avoided and that he was much more optimistic, although some market watchers were less enthusiastic and viewed this as kicking the can down the road, while Europe remains unwilling to budge on the WA which dampens the prospects of passing the deal in a 3rd meaningful vote. Elsewhere, antipodeans are rangebound with AUD/USD and NZD/USD consolidating in the aftermath of this week’s Fed and data-induced fluctuations, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are tentative amid the mixed overnight risk tone.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices boosted in the wake of the dovish Fed and with longer-term yields dropping to multi-year lows, while focus now turns to today’s enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs.</p>",
