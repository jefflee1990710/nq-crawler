Home Depot (HD) lagged after a downgrade at Guggenheim. Tinder parent Match Group (MTCH) rose on a Buy initiation at Citi. KLA-Tencor (KLAC) opened higher after boosting dividend, as well as a share buyback programme, and affirmed guidance, although it did pare gains through the session. General Motors (GM) drifted higher amid its efforts (and reportedly the White House’s too, though this was denied), to find an agreement with the UAW to stop the strikes - which if unresolved - could result in deteriorating profit for the automaker. S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3006, NASDAQ-100 0.5% at 7889, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27109.</p><p>Markets are waiting for the Fed. Yields were lower across the curve by between 2-4bps at settlement, and the shape of the curve had bull-flattened again, with major curve spreads narrowing by around 1bps, or so. The FOMC is expected to deliver a 25bps rate cut at Wednesday's meeting, but the pricing has today become more balanced, at around 50/50 (compared to 70/30 on Monday, weighted towards a 25bps cut; there is no pricing for a 50bps cut in September). US T-note futures (Z9) settled 7 ticks higher at 129-09.</p>",

However, CNN reported that US Deputy Press Secretary Gidley said US President Trump is being cautious in his assessment of the attacks, adding that Trump wants to ensure the evidence is clear, but the report suggested he believes that, in all likelihood, it was Iran, but will clarify when he had a definitive answer. In a similar vein, Saudi Energy Minister said that the Kingdom did not yet know who was behind the attacks, or why. US VP Pence chimed in, stating the US military is ready and the US is ready to defend its interests and allies; although he too did not explicitly label Iran as the perpetrator. Yemen’s Houthis have claimed responsibility for the attacks but analysts at CSIS note that given the long distance and precise nature of the bombings, “it is extremely doubtful that the Houthi could have executed them without Iranian assistance.” Even if Iran were to admit providing the used weapons to the Houthis, CSIS says it will likely deny blame and instead insist Yemen operated autonomously, something that the US would not accept as a valid reason to relieve Iran from blame.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 3.56 LOWER AT USD 59.34/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES USD 4.47 LOWET AT USD 64.55/BBL: </strong>Crude futures pared some of Monday’s historic gains, after sources reported Saudi oil output will return to normal levels quicker than initially assumed; something that Saudi’s energy minister confirmed later in the session. Aramco CEO said that the Abqaiq facility (7mln BPD capacity) is currently producing 2mln BPD, but that all facilities to restore production – where 5.7mln BPD was initially lost – will be back online by the end of the month, markedly earlier than previous sources had suggested (capacity could be back online might take ‘weeks’ to ‘months’) although it was suggested that between 30-40% of operations had already been restored; some sources said that remaining production was to be restored by September-end, in line with the Saudi Energy Minister’s later announcement in later trade. If the production returns as swiftly as suggested, then this should help alleviate some of the supply concerns which have been baked into the market’s tightness, reflected in calendar spreads a few months down the line in Brent; signs of physical supply disruptions had already come to the surface on Tuesday, after it was reported some grades of Saudi crude had been delayed for delivery by 10 days following the Aramco attacks, and Aramco had warned that some October deliveries might be also delayed. The Saudi energy minister later said that it will keep full supply to its customers this month. Beyond the immediate supply outages, the Aramco attacks were a reminder for participants who had dismissed the crude market’s susceptibility to geopolitical risk after the firing of John Bolton recently, and now the question that is being reassessed is what is the correct geopolitical risk premium? PVM’s analysts noted a proposed a value of at least USD 5-10/bbl above the jump caused by a shortage, on the rationale that “a few gadgets worth a couple of thousand dollars can cause a damage of this magnitude.”</p><p><strong>* US REPO: </strong>The surge in overnight repo rates, which jumped to the highest since 2003 (at around 10% while the effective fed funds rate jumped to 2.25% on Monday from 2.14% on Friday, to the top-end of the Fed's target range), has been explained by demand for dollars from those who are settling Treasury purchases, as well as corporates who needed dollars to pay taxes. The Fed entered the market with an unscheduled repo operation – the first in a decade, offering USD 75bln of liquidity, and ultimately repoing USD 53.15bln, which immediately calmed markets, and sent overnight repo rates tumbling to zero, according to Refinitiv pricing; there had been some suggestion that the funding squeeze could illustrate a broken monetary transmission mechanism with a Fed which cannot control rates within its target band, however, analysts noted that the Fed entering the market had a soothing effect, and pushed rates lower, suggesting the Fed still has control. Wells Fargo notes that the payment of corporate taxes contributed to the drain of reserves from the system of likely somewhere around USD 100bln, but on the other hand, mid-month Treasury settlements brought USD 54bln in net supply to the market yesterday. \"This is a particularly large day of settlements, but is indicative of a broader trend of a growing supply of Treasuries (used as collateral for repurchase agreements) in the market with a falling supply of cash in the form of bank reserves,\" Wells Fargo says, adding that it expected to see similar pressures coming from month-end, but perhaps not quite to the degree of the move witnessed on Tuesday. WFC adds that net T-bill issuance is expected to drop off from the rapid pace of weekly issuance over the past six weeks, but settlements of coupon notes and bonds on 30th September will be a similar USD 50bln.</p><p><strong>* FED PREVIEW: </strong>The FOMC is expected to further lower rates by 25bps to 1.75-2.00%; there will again likely be hawkish dissent from George and Rosengren, though Bullard may make the case for an aggressive 50bps cut. The meeting will feature updated economic forecasts, which are not expected to be tweaked significantly; the updated ‘dot plot’ will likely see the rate path lowered; fed funds futures currently see 100bps of rate cuts over the Fed’s forecast horizon. Markets will be looking for guidance on how much further the Fed will cut rates; Powell is expected to reiterate the Fed’s optionality to act if needed, and is likely to retain his upbeat tone on the US economy, while cognizant of the inflation and international risks. Rate decision and projections is scheduled for 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 18th&nbsp;September 2019; press conference with Chair Powell scheduled for 1930 BST/1430 EDT.&nbsp;To download the report, <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22790/download\">please click here</a>. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US AUGUST INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: </strong>US Industrial Production rose by 0.6% M/M in August, beating expectations of 0.2%; capacity utilisation rose to 77.9% from 77.5%, and manufacturing output rose 0.5% M/M, ahead of the 0.2% expectation. The data suggests that the drag on US producers from weaker global demand may be starting to fade, Capital Economics says, but the latest surveys suggest that recovery won’t be sustained. \"Unfortunately, this unexpected improvement has not been matched by the manufacturing surveys,\" the economic consultancy says, citing the Empire State manufacturing index released on Monday, which fell back and remains consistent with manufacturing output continuing to decline in 3m/3m annualised terms. \"The upshot is that it’s still too soon to conclude that the manufacturing recession is over,\" CapEco writes.</p><p><strong>* CANADA JULY MANUFACTURING SALES</strong>: The data was worse than expected, coming in at -1.3% M/M against an expected -0.2%. RBC suggests that the data was not altogether surprising, since it is to be expected given that US manufacturing sector, impacted by rising tariff costs as a result of the escalating US-China trade dispute, was bound to spill over to Canada at some point. \"The question, in terms of the broader economic growth backdrop, is how much the other 90% of the economy that is not the manufacturing sector can fill the hole,\" RBC writes, \"the trade war has also pushed interest rates sharply lower which, combined with still-strong labour markets and rising wages, has left a better household income backdrop than was expected even several months ago.\" Looking ahead, Friday's retail sales data will offer the next clue as to the extent that offset is developing, RBC says, but for now, the bank continues to expect a 1.8% increase in Q3 Canadian GDP.</p><p><strong>* PBOC MLF: </strong>The PBOC rolled over CNY 265bln of maturing MLF, conducting a CNY 200bln operation of 1-year MLF, keeping the rate unchanged at 3.3%. By doing so, the central bank has drained CNY 145bln of liquidity from the system, which feels a bit more hawkish than market expectations amid the disappointing China data released recently, UBS says. \"However, given the RRR cut just came into effective yesterday, releasing CNY 800bln of liquidity into the system, the interbank market does not seem to have urgent demand for liquidity.\" UBS thinks the PBOC is giving markets time to get used to the new LPR mechanism. Furthermore, UBS says, the PBOC may want to wait until the Fed cuts before it making its real move (which could see the LPR lowered at the fixing on 20th September) since the rate of the yuan will be key in the next round of trade talks. \"Even though the 1-year MLF rate has been kept unchanged today, I expect the PBOC will guide down the LPR in September by reducing the spread between LPR and MLF rate if the Fed cuts on Wednesday (as market widely expected),\" UBS writes.</p><p><strong>* RBA MINUTES: </strong>The central bank left rates unchanged at the record low of 1.00% at the September meeting, though the minutes were more dovish than the post-meeting statement had implied. It is notable given the meeting pre-dated some key recent developments, like the spike in oil prices due to Middle Eastern geopolitics, and is a signal that the door may be open to further rate cuts in the meetings ahead. The Bank's discussion on global factors was downbeat (the post-meeting statement described the international outlook as \"reasonable\"), noting US/China tensions, slowdown in China and slowing international trade volumes; domestically, the RBA provided little by way of new information, though noted that wage growth is stalling, and forward-looking indicators continue to hint at a moderation in employment growth in the months ahead; businesses are yet to ramp up capex plans; housing market outlook was also subdued. \"Further RBA cuts are likely, and we remain with our base case for terminal cash of 0.5% in 2020,\" RBC said. \"The timing, as always, is tricky with global developments keeping pressure on the RBA, however, we continue to favour November for the next move largely based on domestic considerations with domestic data, especially the policy sensitive numbers – confidence, lending, house prices – mixed.\" RBC adds that this argues for a bit of patience from the RBA, as it awaits further data to gauge the extent of policy traction.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK: </strong>The Riksbank meeting minutes, where it held rates at -0.25%, have revealed that the central bank is split. As a reminder, the bank's rate path indicated a rate hike around the turn of the year, and the Board was unanimous in its decision. \"The minutes show that the Riksbank is optimistic about the economy in general and inflation in particular, which is why the bank continues to signal a rate hike,\" Nordea writes. To summarise, Deputy Governor Jansson accepted the rate path (which surprises Nordea), though he was close to speaking out against it, since it indicated a high probability of a near-term hike, and Jansson has been concerned about lower inflation and inflation expectations; Floden, meanwhile, was sceptical regarding transmission mechanism of negative rates. Nordea says there seems to also be growing disagreement with regards to how much the Riksbank's monetary policy should track the ECB, with Ingves and Skingsley seeing larger independence, although Jansson is concerned about the ECB’s easing measures. \"All in all, the Riksbank is increasingly split, which makes the bank difficult to read,\" Nordea writes, \"Deputy Governor af Jochnick’s departure likely means that there will be five voting members during the coming meetings, which adds to the uncertainty.\" However, the bank notes that the key takeaway could be that the central bank is too optimistic on the economy. \"The weak inflation and labour market readings make a rate hike very unlikely,\" Nordea writes, \"moreover, we continue to expect economic data to disappoint. The upward pressure on oil prices adds some uncertainty in the opposite direction. But given the bleak outlook, underlined by today’s very weak labour market data, we stick to our view of a rate cut around the turn of the year.\"</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLE 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-09.</strong> Markets are waiting for the Fed. Yields were lower across the curve by between 2-4bps at settlement, and the shape of the curve had bull-flattened again, with major curve spreads narrowing by around 1bps, or so. The FOMC is expected to deliver a 25bps rate cut at Wednesday's meeting, but the pricing has today become more balanced, at around 50/50 (compared to 70/30 on Monday, weighted towards a 25bps cut; there is no pricing for a 50bps cut in September).</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3006, NASDAQ-100 0.5% at 7889, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27109</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.6%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy -1.5%, Financials 0.1%, Health Care 0.1%, Industrials -0.1%, Information Technology 0.4%, Materials 0.7%, Telecommunication Services 0.3%, Utilities 0.9%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The energy sector (XOP) underperformed after crude prices pared some of Monday’s gains, which allowed airlines (AAL, UAL) to rise on the advantage of lower fuel prices, whilst retailers (XRT) felt the pain as investors grew concerned on consumer discretionary income due to prices at the pump. Corning (GLW) tumbled as it lowered its volume sales guidance for Q3. Kraft Heinz (KHC) came under pressure after its second largest shareholder reduced its stake, again. Home Depot (HD) lagged after a downgrade at Guggenheim. Tinder parent Match Group (MTCH) rose on a Buy initiation at Citi. KLA-Tencor (KLAC) opened higher after boosting dividend, as well as a share buyback programme, and affirmed guidance, although it did pare gains through the session. General Motors (GM) drifted higher amid its efforts (and reportedly the White House’s too, though this was denied), to find an agreement with the UAW to stop the strikes - which if unresolved - could result in deteriorating profit for the automaker.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD:</strong>&nbsp;The dollar is lower after the Fed entered the market to sooth fears of a liquidity squeeze, injecting USD 53bln via a repo operation; pre-FOMC positioning, and a bull-flattening Treasury curve were also cited; others note that the US produces more than Saudi Arabia, and if oil prices remain elevated and the arb between WTI and Brent widens (thereby increasing WTI's relative appeal over Brent), then there is a possibility that the US current account could improve; attention will now be on weekly DOE data, specifically the exports component, although it is next week's data that might capture the Saudi effect, if oil prices are sustained.&nbsp;<strong>EUR:</strong>&nbsp;The Euro tends to benefit when oil prices fall given the inflation expectations channel, and the single currency firmed on Tuesday, though the Greenback was likely providing heavy influence, and ZEW data showed the expectations component jumping, offering encouragement on the health of Germany’s economy.&nbsp;<strong>SEK:</strong>&nbsp;Weakened after mixed Riksbank meeting minutes and (more likely) the weak jobs data.&nbsp;<strong>COMMODITY FX:</strong>&nbsp;The complex is mixed, with crude giving back some of this week's sharp gains, as the official assessment of when Saudi will be back to full capacity is seen in 'weeks' rather than months, as well as US President Trump stating there is no need to tap the SPR yet. <strong>CAD</strong> is marginally lower, taking cues from crude as well as weak manufacturing data for July; <strong>RUB</strong> is lower with oil, but also as many other EMs come under pressure; <strong>NOK</strong>, however, is firmer, likely supported by the weak SEK, and ahead of this week's Norges Bank meeting. The notable oil importers <strong>TRY</strong> and <strong>INR</strong> firmed after Monday's losses, as lower oil prices and a weaker USD present favourable current account dynamics. The <strong>ZAR</strong>, however, was still reeling from higher oil prices, newswires said.&nbsp;<strong>HAVEN FX:JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> are more or less flat against the buck, ahead of this week's central bank confabs for both; there is a possibility that both could loosen policy, though it does not seem to be the prevailing consensus. <strong>XAU</strong> holds above USD 1500, where it seems comfortable. The Antipodes are mixed;&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;has pared losses after dovish RBA meeting minutes overnight, trading flat heading into APAC trade (USD likely playing a role);&nbsp;<strong>NZD</strong>&nbsp;is flat/up marginally, the GDT auction saw prices rise, but volumes fall.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;managed to rise above 1.25 as the short squeeze continues, and the buck becomes pressured.</p><p><strong>* BCB PREVIEW:</strong> The Brazilian Central Bank is expected to cut rates by 50bp on Wednesday, taking the Selic rate to 5.5%, which would take the aggregate two meeting easing to 100bps, following the previous decision, where the BCB exceeded expectations for a 25bp cut, unanimously agreeing to lower rates by 50bps. Analysts at Rabobank are in line with the consensus view, and look for the BCB's communications to remain largely unchanged. Recent commentary from BCB chief Campos Neto have been rather cautious, stating the economy warrants stimulative monetary policy, and the increasingly benign inflation outlook should allow for additional stimulus. CPI M/M remained unchanged for August at 0.11% and Y/Y was relatively unchanged at 3.43% (Prev. 3.44%). Therefore, inflation remains well below the BCB’s target of 4.25%, with the latest Focus survey showing the average 2019 inflation forecast at 3.59%, lower than the prior 3.65%; 2020 inflation forecasts also expected at 3.6%, signalling inflation will take some time to return to target. On growth, Neto was very dovish, mentioning it is highly probable that growth will be revised lower, yet again and the short-term outlook is benign. On the global front Neto has expressed doubts to whether developed countries will have the tools to deal with downward global pressures. However, recent GDP was solid as Q/Q printed 0.4%, exceeding expectations for a 0.2% gain, and up from the prior slowdown of -0.2%; Y/Y rose to 1% from 0.5%, (Exp. 0.7%). However, rate cut expectations have been somewhat tempered last week, after data showed private consumption is holding up well (decent retail sales in July), and the labour market is improving too - all of which suggests that the Brazilian economy got off to a solid start in Q3, and perhaps lessening the need for a 50bps cut (although money markets are still priced for -50bps). Nevertheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that consumer confidence remains low, and consumers are expected to remain cautious in the near-term. \"The strength of July's report will not prevent the COPOM from easing further,\" the consultancy writes, \"as other key economic sectors are still under strain, particularly industry which continues to struggle on the back of external and specific domestic shocks,\" and moreover, \"the BRL has performed well this month, giving some leeway to policymakers.\" Looking ahead, money markets have currently priced around 80bps of easing through the end of the year.</p>",

The notable oil importers <strong>TRY </strong>and <strong>INR </strong>firmed after Monday's losses, as lower oil prices and a weaker buck present favourable current account dynamics. The ZAR, however, was still realing from higher oil prices, newswires reported. <strong>HAVEN FX: JPY </strong>and <strong>CHF </strong>are more or less flat against the buck, ahead of this week's central bank confabs for both; there is a possibility that both could loosen policy, though it does not seem to be the prevailing consensus. <strong>XAU </strong>holds above USD 1500, where it seems comfortable. The Antipodes are mixed; <strong>AUD </strong>has pared losses after dovish RBA meeting minutes overnight, trading flat heading into APAC trade (USD likely playing a role; <strong>NZD </strong>is flat/up marginally, the GDT auction saw prices rise, but volumes fall. <strong>GBP </strong>managed to rise above 1.25 as the short squeeze continues, and the buck becomes pressured.&nbsp;</p>",

The FOMC is expected to deliver a 25bps rate cut at Wednesday's meeting, but the pricing has today become more balanced, at around 50/50 (compared to 70/30 on Monday, weighted towards a 25bps cut; there is no pricing for a 50bps cut in September).</li><li>The FOMC is expected to further lower rates by 25bps to 1.75-2.00%; there will again likely be hawkish dissent from George and Rosengren, though Bullard may make the case for an aggressive 50bps cut. The meeting will feature updated economic forecasts, which are not expected to be tweaked significantly; the updated ‘dot plot’ will likely see the rate path lowered; fed funds futures currently see 100bps of rate cuts over the Fed’s forecast horizon. Markets will be looking for guidance on how much further the Fed will cut rates; Powell is expected to reiterate the Fed’s optionality to act if needed, and is likely to retain his upbeat tone on the US economy, while cognizant of the inflation and international risks.

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>Crude futures pared some of Monday’s historic gains, after sources reported Saudi oil output will return to normal levels quicker than initially assumed; something that Saudi officially stated later in the session. Aramco CEO said that the Abqaiq facility (7mln BPD capacity) is currently producing at 2mln BPD but that all needed facilities to restore production – where 5.7mln BPD was initially lost – will be back online by the end of the month. This was a markedly more progressive update than previous sources had suggested, where there were reports that the rest of capacity could be back online might take ‘weeks’ to ‘months’, although some sources did suggest the remaining production was to be restored by September-end, in line with the Saudi Energy Minister’s announcement in later trade. If the production returns as swiftly as suggested, then this should help alleviate some of the supply concerns which have been baked into the market’s tightness, reflected in time spreads a few months down the line in Brent futures. Signs of physical supply disruptions had already come to the surface on Tuesday where it was reported some grades of Saudi crude had been delayed for delivery by 10 days following the Aramco attacks, and Aramco had warned that some October deliveries might be delayed; Saudi Energy Minister later said that it will keep full supply to its customers this month. Beyond the immediate supply outages, the Aramco attacks were a rude awakening for participants who had dismissed the crude market’s susceptibility to geopolitical risk after the firing of John Bolton recently, and now the question that is being reassessed is what is the correct geopolitical risk premium? PVM Oil’s analysts noted that some industry sources had proposed a value of at least USD 5-10/bbl above the jump caused by a shortage, on the rationale that “a few gadgets worth a couple of thousand dollars can cause a damage of this magnitude.”</li><li>N.B.

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Petro currencies lurch as Saudi sees return to max oil output in 2-3 weeks",
        "content": "<p><strong>SEK/NOK/CAD</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona was already underperforming on the back of latest Riksbank minutes that highlighted concerns about deteriorating sentiment and more pronounced risks of a downturn in the economy, while Board member Janssen also raised doubts about retaining guidance for a further 25 bp hike in the repo rate towards the end of 2019 or early next year. However, Eur/Sek remained elevated around 10.7100 alongside Eur/Nok when headlines broke quoting a ‘top’ Saudi source suggesting that restoration efforts to get crude capacity back to full capacity are running ahead of schedule and could be completed within 2-3 weeks. In fact, 70% of the 5.7 bpd oil output lost due to the weekend attacks has almost returned. The Norwegian Crown slumped from around 9.8570 towards 9.9050 vs the Euro and Usd/Cad rallied to within a whisker of 1.3300 having held below last Friday’s 1.3288 peak following weaker than forecast Canadian manufacturing sales, with the Loonie also deriving some support ahead of the 200 DMA (1.3309).</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound and single currency have both gradually strengthened and built momentum after resisting attempts to test/breach sub-round number supports at 1.2385 and 1.0985 respectively (earlier September lows) vs the Dollar. Cable has subsequently revisited highs just short of 1.2500 and Eur/Usd is eyeing 1.1050 and the 21 DMA (1.1048) having eclipsed the 10 DMA (1.1038) and some decent expiry interest along the way (1 bn at 1.1025-30 and nearly 1 bn between 1.1040-50 prior to the NY cut). Note, some better elements in the latest ZEW survey may also have given the Euro some traction, while the <strong>DXY </strong>also drifted down to fresh session lows of 98.326 after only a brief uptick on stronger than forecast US IP data as riskier counterparts gleaned more from the about-turn in crude prices in wake of the aforementioned Aramco news.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/CHF/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is back on an even keel vs its US and Aussie peers, with Nzd/Usd rebounding towards 0.6350 from circa 0.6325 and Aud/Nzd back down near 1.0800, and perhaps for once a rise in GDT auction prices has helped. However, Aud/Usd has also pared losses within a 0..6830-70 range, Usd/Chf has pulled back below 0.9850 and Usd/Jpy is midway between 108.03-36 parameters as the Greenback trades defensively into Wednesday’s FOMC and as the Fed eased funding strains via a first overnight repo in 10 years.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Almost instant relief for the Lira as oil reversed course, with Usd/Try down from 5.7400 or thereabouts and testing bids/support under 5.7000, while other regional currencies remained weak, but also recovered from worst levels amidst a broad improvement in risk sentiment.</p>",

Energy sector (+1.1%) continues to outperform, as crude prices cling on to the recent outsized gains, which continues to weigh on airline names including EasyJet (-1.3%) and RyanAir (-2.5%). Meanwhile, some strength in the more defensive utilities (+0.6%), health care (+0.9%) and consumer staples (+0.8%) sectors is suggestive of a fragile risk tone, although the risk sensitive tech sector (+0.3%) is also in the green. Leading the laggards are Financials (-1.2%), with this week’s fall in yields and pronounced curve flattening failing to provide any support. In terms of stock specifics; Zalando (-9.1%) is the notable underperformer, after the Co. announced the placement of over 13mln new shares. Total (+1.7%) is deriving support not only from higher crude prices but also the news of a 30% output increase in one of its South Korean ethylene plants. AB InBev (+0.7%) is supported by news that the co. is looking to raise USD 4.8bln (according to a company statement) in the IPO of its AsiaPac unit in Hong Kong; although this is below the pre-market reports that they were seeking around USD 7bln. Finally, ThyssenKrupp (-0.8%) failed to garner support from reports that Advent International and Cinven &amp; Abu Dhabi Investment Authority had teamed up to place a bid on the co.’s elevator unit, which could put them in competition with the likes of Kone (-0.3%).</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>SEK/AUD - </strong>Marked G10 underperformers and both undermined by Central Bank releases to varying degrees, while worrying data from Sweden has also undermined the Crown as unemployment jumped in August and total employment declined. Eur/Sek has rallied from around 10.6240 to 10.7150+ in wake of minutes from the Riksbank revealing deeper divisions on the repo rate path with Janssen unsure whether it is appropriate to maintain guidance for a hike around the turn of the year. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd has retreated further from recent peaks towards 0.6830 as the RBA remains ready to ease again to support growth and keep inflation on course to reach target, adding that it is reasonable to expect the OCR to be low for a lengthy period of time.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/CHF - </strong>The Kiwi is also on the back foot and hovering around 0.6325 vs its US counterpart after a dip in Westpac’s Q3 consumer survey overnight, but holding up a bit better in Aud/Nzd cross terms within a 1.0827-1.0790 range ahead of NZ Q2 current account data and the latest GDT auction. Meanwhile, Sterling is struggling to survive a stringent test of 1.2400 and support just below at 1.2385 following a fruitless journey to Luxembourg by UK PM Johnson and pending the Supreme Court judgement on his suspension of parliament, and the Franc is trying to contain losses circa 0.9950/1.0950 against the Buck and Euro respectively in the run up to the Fed and SNB tomorrow and Thursday.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD - </strong>The Yen has lost a degree of its Saudi safe-haven premium, with Usd/Jpy firmer above the 108.00 level amidst reports that the US and Japan have agreed tentative trade deal terms, while the Loonie is unwinding some oil-inspired gains ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales, as Usd/Cad pivots 1.3250 compared to lows of just a few pips off 1.3200 at one stage yesterday.</p><p><strong>EUR - </strong>The single currency has made a better fist of overcoming downside pressure at a big figure/psychological marker than the Pound, albeit with some assistance from a much more pronounced improvement in German ZEW economic sentiment than anticipated. Indeed, Eur/Usd has reclaimed 1.1000+ status after another probe below to 1.0990 (close to the 1.0985 pre-ECB base) even though the Dollar is firmer in general with the&nbsp; DXY comfortably back above 98.500 within a 98.573-749 band ahead of US ip data and the aforementioned Fed on Wednesday. However, decent option expiries layered between 1.1025-30 and 1.1040-50 (1 bn each time) may cap further Euro recovery gains vs the Greenback.</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes (Sept 3rd</strong>) reiterated the board would consider further policy easing if needed to support growth and inflation targets, while it is reasonable to expect extended period of low rates to achieve employment and inflation targets. Furthermore, minutes noted the Australian economy could sustain lower rates of unemployment and that there are further signs of a turnaround in the housing sector, although the turnover is still low and outlook for consumption growth is a key uncertainty. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Riksbank Minutes:</strong> Even though the real economy and inflation abroad have largely developed as expected, the board members stressed that sentiment has worsened and that the risk of a faster slowdown has increased. Minutes highlight that one member expressed doubt on the rates forecast of a increase towards/after years end. And Jansson commented that, given the inflation forecast, it would have been as reasonable to refrain from a rate hike around year end. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Swiss Government forecast: 2019</strong> growth 0.8% (Prev. forecast 1.2%); 2019 CPI 0.5% (Prev. forecast 0.6%); exports: 2.3% (Prev. forecast 3.1%)</p><p>- 2020: growth 1.7% (Prev. forecast 1.7%); CPI 0.4% (Prev. forecast 0.6%)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It’s been rather belated and perhaps not strictly or even largely in response to the latest ZEW readings, but Bunds and Eurozone peers are now underperforming. The 10 year German debt future has been down to 172.83 (-15 ticks vs +18 ticks at best) vs Gilts still above 132.00 awaiting Supreme Court ruling on prorogation and US Treasuries that have edged a bit further from overnight lows with the curve incrementally flatter into IP and NAHB, API and the Saudi presser.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>The crude complex consolidated on Tuesday morning, and holds on to the lion’s share of yesterday’s outsized gains which came on the combination of an uptick in geopolitical risk premia and supply shock after an attack left a significant portion of Saudi oil production offline. <strong>Brent Nov’ 19 futures</strong>, although well off yesterday’s extreme near USD 72/bbl highs, has lost the USD 68.0/bbl handle, while <strong>WTI Oct’ 19 futures</strong> range places it around the USD 62.0/bbl mark. The market now awaits an official update from the Saudis at 18.00/18:15 BST regarding the extent of the damage to the country’s oil producing infrastructure; mixed reports thus far, some suggested about 40% of the disrupted output has been restored and the remaining production could be back online as soon as month-end, but others were less optimistic and anticipate a return to full output could take months. In terms of commentary, US Energy Secretary Perry, when asked about tapping the US SPR, said that he is confident the markets are well supplied, and that the US will take a wait and see approach when it comes to its potential use. Russian Energy Minister Novak said there is still no information regarding the weekend's Saudi Oil attacks and that the price spike following the attacks reflects uncertainty and risk. Meanwhile, as the dust settles in wake of the attack, evidence of supply disruptions continue to emerge; Saudi Aramco have reportedly delayed some oil loading grades by a number of days following and have asked some customers to accept different oil grades. Moreover, Indian State refiners are reportedly mulling switching crude oil grades to avoid supply disruptions from Saudi Aramco. Elsewhere, <strong>Gold </strong>moves sideways, holding on to recent gains that saw the precious metal jump back above USD 1500/oz; though it has struggled to stay above this mark. Separately, the Indian Government may be considering a full exit from Hindustan Copper as according to reports.</p><p><strong>Saudi Aramco lost production was said to have been 40% restored on Monday according to Energy Intel industry sources in which one source expects the remaining production to be restored by September-end</strong>. (Energy Intel)</p><p><strong>Saudi Aramco have delayed some oil loading grades by a number of days following the weekends attacks and have asked some customers to accept different oil grades</strong>. Prior to this, Saudi Aramco have informed Petrochina that light crude loading will be delayed by approximately 10 days, will receive the same volumes and light grades as contracted for October., according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak</strong> says there is still no information regarding the weekend's Saudi Oil attacks, prices following the attacks reflect uncertainty and risk. Subsequently, Kremlin state that it is still unclear how Saudi Arabia intend to deal with their output consequences, and we need to wait; in reference to the Saudi Arabia attacks.

The market now awaits an official update from the Saudis at 18.00/18:15 BST regarding the extent of the damage to the country’s oil producing infrastructure; mixed reports thus far, some suggested about 40% of the disrupted output has been restored and the remaining production could be back online as soon as month-end, but others were less optimistic and anticipate a return to full output could take months. In terms of commentary, US Energy Secretary Perry, when asked about tapping the US SPR, said that he is confident the markets are well supplied, and that the US will take a wait and see approach when it comes to its potential use. Russian Energy Minister Novak said there is still no information regarding the weekend's Saudi Oil attacks and that the price spike following the attacks reflects uncertainty and risk. Meanwhile, as the dust settles in wake of the attack, evidence of supply disruptions continue to emerge; Saudi Aramco have reportedly delayed some oil loading grades by a number of days following and have asked some customers to accept different oil grades. Moreover, Indian State refiners are reportedly mulling switching crude oil grades to avoid supply disruptions from Saudi Aramco. Elsewhere, <strong>Gold </strong>moves sideways, holding on to recent gains that saw the precious metal jump back above USD 1500/oz; though it has struggled to stay above this mark. Separately, the Indian Government may be considering a full exit from Hindustan Copper as according to reports.</p>",

Ahead, no scheduled UK data or events, but domestic markets are awaiting the Supreme Court’s verdict on PM Johnson’s parliament prorogation.</p>",

Looking at the inflation forecast, it would have been just as reasonable to refrain from a repo rate rise around the turn of the year and, if the prospects hold up and there is no desire to change the size of the overall rate increase during the forecast period, instead focus on increasing the interest rate a little more later on.</li><li>Ingves: inflation continuing to develop in line with the target and target attainment is good. Long-term inflation expectations also continue to remain around 2 per cent, which is obviously good. It is too early to draw any conclusions from more expansionary policy abroad</li><li>Floden: Swedish monetary policy needs to be formulated with respect to the ever-lower international level of interest rates.

Meanwhile, <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> marginally extended its pullback from 1.2500 with PM Johnson’s government said to have made a number of backstop proposals, although European Commission President Juncker later suggested there has not yet been any which meet the objectives of the backstop. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was choppy after the initial momentum above 108.00 gradually faded, while antipodeans were pressured due to the risk averse tone and as <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> eventually trickled lower following the RBA minutes which reiterated the board would consider further policy easing if needed and that consumption growth was a key uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>RBA Minutes (Sept 3rd) reiterated the board would consider further policy easing if needed to support growth and inflation targets, while it is reasonable to expect extended period of low rates to achieve employment and inflation targets. Furthermore, minutes noted the Australian economy could sustain lower rates of unemployment and that there are further signs of a turnaround in the housing sector, although the turnover is still low and outlook for consumption growth is a key uncertainty. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities were weaker in which <strong>oil</strong> prices pulled back from its largest ever daily gain after output disruption from the recent attacks on Saudi’s oil facilities and with heightened geopolitical tensions in the region amid continued finger-pointing at Iran. Nonetheless, <strong>oil</strong> prices are lower by more than 1% overnight as they took a breather from the record rally, while reports suggested about 40% of the disrupted output has been restored and the remaining production could be back online as soon as month-end, although others were less optimistic and anticipated a return to full output could take months. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> traded sideways just below the USD 1500/oz as it awaits the looming FOMC and <strong>copper</strong> marginally extended on recent losses amid the cautious risk tone, as well as the underperformance seen in its largest buyer China.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US President Trump said the US could release oil from its reserves and other countries could be a little more generous supplying oil to bring prices down</strong> but also stated that oil prices have not risen that much in the wake of the attack on the Aramco plants, while he also suggested that the spike in oil will not impact US and ultimately won’t affect the world either.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>US President Trump said diplomacy is never exhausted when it comes to Iran and that he is not looking for a new conflict but sometimes you have to. <strong>Trump added that he is in no rush to respond to the attacks and that he agrees with Secretary of State Pompeo on Iran responsibility for the Saudi attacks</strong> with the US to decide on a response when we are sure, while he responded that he thinks it would when asked if a military strike on Iran would be proportional to the attack on Saudi oil facilities. (Newswires)</p><p>US Defense Secretary Esper said the US is working with its partners to defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran. There were also comments from US Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Risch that the Aramco attacks highlights Iranian efforts \"to sow instability\" in the Middle East, while he added that Iran should not underestimate US resolve and any attacks against US forces must be met with \"overwhelming response\". (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Iranian President Rouhani said the Aramco attacks were a reciprocal response to the aggression against Yemen</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump said he is probably not inclined to visit North Korea yet, although there were separate comments from the US State Department that the US is ready to resume denuclearization talks with North Korea.

T-Note futures gapped higher at the open on Sunday, but then proceeded horizontally through until settlement. The sudden spike in oil prices and geopolitical risk revival has participants concerned on the raised global recession chances, where already protracted manufacturing downturn could be catalysed by sudden spiked energy costs. The Fed has previously identified global developments as a factor within its outlook that has kept it cautious, and while the attacks have contributed to cost-push inflation (not the good kind), markets still do not see any rate move by more than 25bps (around a 70% chance of a 25bps cut, around 30% chance of an unchanged rate decision, according to money markets). At settlement, major curve spreads had narrowed modestly. US T-notes (z9) settled 15+ ticks higher at 129-02.</p><p>US President Trump said they have reached an initial trade agreement with Japan regarding tariff barriers and intends for a deal in the upcoming weeks in which US will enter an executive agreement with Japan on digital trade.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower following a similar subdued tone on Wall St where the S&amp;P 500 slipped back below the 3k milestone and the DJIA snapped an 8-day win streak after attacks on Saudi’s oil facilities, while participants also await the looming billow of central bank policy updates. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) are lacklustre with weakness in Australia’s mining and materials sectors just overshadowing the continued rise in energy stocks as oil prices take a breather from the prior day’s record surge, while the Japanese benchmark lacks conviction and largely reflects a choppy currency. Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) are the laggards, aside from their energy names, after the PBoC refrained from open market operations and although it announced to lend CNY 200bln through its Medium-term Lending Facility, this was below the CNY 265bln maturing today and the rate was maintained at 3.3% to the disappointment of the increased speculations for a cut.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat but remains near the prior day’s best levels after the recent safe-haven support and continued weakness in its major counterparts with EUR/USD just about holding on to the 1.1000 handle after having breached several shorter-term DMAs to the downside and following bearish comments on the economy from ECB’s Lane who suggested incoming information points to a more extended slowdown of Euro Area growth dynamics than anticipated. GBP/USD marginally extended its pullback from 1.2500 with PM Johnson’s government said to have made a number of backstop proposals, although European Commission President Juncker suggested there has not yet been any which meet the objectives of the backstop. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy as the initial momentum above 108.00 gradually faded, while antipodeans are lacklustre due to the risk averse tone and as AUD/USD eventually trickled lower following the RBA minutes which reiterated the board would consider further policy easing if needed and that consumption growth is a key uncertainty.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and have reclaimed the 154.00 level amid safe-haven flows and with the BoJ also present in the market for JPY 760bln of JGBs in the belly to the shorter-end of the curve.</p>",
