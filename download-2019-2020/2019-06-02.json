Later Moody's said the new US tariffs on Mexico would be credit negative for the US auto sector which relies heavily on imports from Mexico. Constellations Brands (STZ), owner of Corona beer, was also hit by the news. Energy names, including ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhilips (COP), shrugged off news that the US was to postpone petrochemical sanctions on Iran, in an apparent attempt to de-escalate tensions between the two nations, and instead followed the crude complex lower as risk sentiment soured. Tesla (TSLA) managed to outperform much of the tech/automaker sector on the day as news emerged that the firm was to lower the price of its Model S in China to spur demand. Costco (COST) lost ground despite the firm posting a beat on both top and bottom-line earnings expectations and Baird analyst Peter Benedict saying the co.’s bull thesis remains intact. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sold off somewhat as news emerged that it had lost another talcum powder case, one of thousands and must pay a USD 300mln punitive award in New York. Gap (GPS) sunk after the co. reported poor earnings. Dell Technologies (DELL) opened lower after a revenue miss.

The fixed income bid was also supported by a slide in equities, although month-end models had suggest positive inflows into stocks. And the latest US measures against Mexico have added to Treasury upside as we close out the week; With 2s, 5s sub-2%, 7s are a couple of basis points away. Bund yields fell in sympathy, seeing German 10yr yields flirt with fresh all-time lows. Comments from Clarida on Thursday and the aforementioned risk-off were underpinning the bid on Friday. At settlement, the curve had bull-flattened, though major curve spreads were steeper (notably the 2s20s widened 6bps, 2s10s +5bps, 5s30s +3bps, 2s5s +3bps). US T-note futures (M9) settled +22 ticks at 126-12.</p>",
