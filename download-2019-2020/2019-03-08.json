        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities down, dollar down, Treasuries up, crude .</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>Payrolls miss; Trump/Xi meeting potentially pushed back; EU’s Barnier proposes a non-starter,</p><p><strong>* NEXT WEEK:</strong> German trade; US retail sales; Business Inventories; US President Trump release prelim overview of budget; UK PM May to meet with EC President Juncker; US 3yr note auction; Earnings from Deutsche Post and Uniper;</p><p><i><strong>HEADS-UP: On Sunday, US moves onto summer time, and clocks will move forward by one hour. with UK time not changing for another two weeks. This means that between Sunday March 10th and Sunday March 31st, the gap between London and NY will be 4 hrs and London/Chicago will be 5 hrs.</strong></i></p><p><strong>* NON-FARM PAYROLLS: </strong>US nonfarm payrolls missed expectations by some margin, printing 20k vs a consensus 180k. \"The 180K consensus for payrolls appeared completely to ignore the huge overshoot to trend in January, which screamed risk of a hefty downside correction,\" Pantheon said, \"in the event the downshift was bigger than we expected but the 186K average increase in payrolls in the past three months is entirely respectable.\" The consultancy notes that while indicators of labour demand have softened slightly, they were not weak enough to suggest that the February data is signalling the beginning of a new trend, and Pantheon sees a return towards trend rates next month. On a brighter note, AHE rose to 3.4% YY; Pantheon said the jump was a correction after the January number was depressed by the long-standing calendar distortion, which Pantheon says depresses reported AHE in months when the 15th - payday for people paid semi-monthly - falls after the survey week. \"Firms are meant to report wages on an accruals basis but some appear to report only cash outlays, so AHE looks soft in these months and then rebounds, adding though that \"still, the YY rate rose to a new cycle high of 3.4%, and we expect further gains ahead as employees increasingly flex their muscles in the labour market,\" adding that \"the late cycle scarcity premium finally is emerging.\" Meanwhile, the jobless rate fell to 3.8% from 4.0%, perhaps due to household employment rebounding, reversing the January fall, while the size of the labour force fell slightly. \"The bottom line,\" Pantheon concludes, \"is that this report has something for hawks (wages) and doves (payrolls); it won't move the needle at the Fed.\"</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Once again the enforcement issues of the trade deal were at the forefront of traders’ minds, though ultimately there is still little clarity on how any trade would be enforced. Following the NYT report that Chinese officials were pessimistic on a trade deal being made quickly; Politico cited a senior White House official playing down the article, however, suggesting that it has always been true that the non-retaliation pledge would be a tough for Beijing to accept. US NEC Director Kudlow commented too today, and said negotiations between the two sides were ongoing. Kudlow added to the uncertainty after suggesting that a meeting between Trump and Xi could happen at either the end of this month or early April; previous guidance suggested a meeting at Mar-a-Lago on the 27th March, so any delay to that timeline would highlight the challenging nature of the negotiations. In later trade, it was reported that Chinese reportedly have reomved the trip to Mar-a-Lago from China President Xi's calendar, Fox reported.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>As crunch time approaches for PM May and her Brexit plan, this week once again was another ‘stalemate’ with both the UK and EU still seemingly far apart in their demands which culminated in AG Cox and Brexit Secretary Barclay scrapping their visit to Brussels on Friday. Today saw EU Chief Brexit negotiator Barnier echo this sentiment, saying that no progress had been made in Brexit talks, however he did propose some legally binding interpretations for the withdrawal agreement. Barnier proposed that the EU commits to give the UK the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally, but added that the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border. Although UK government sources soon rejected this, with DUP leader Dodds describing Barnier’s proposals as a “non-starter”. Dodds went on to say that the EU’s offer was neither realistic, nor sensible, saying it disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, and was an attempt to get ahead in a possible blame game. And this is the key here; ahead of next week’s votes in the UK, sides are already jockeying to pass blame onto the other side, something which was a motivating factor for Barnier to tweet his proposals.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLES USD 0.59 LOWER AT USD 56.07/BBL, BRENT (K9) SETTLES USD 0.56 LOWER AT USD 65.74/BBL. </strong>Crude prices ended the week on a down note, after reaching weekly highs on Thursday. The complex began its selloff overnight – taking cues from the strong drop in Chinese equities – and continued its downward trajectory on the back of a NFP headline miss. The market has become increasingly alert and sensitive to the demand side of the equation, in which the narrative of slowing global growth becomes more and more evident. In Friday’s news flow, Saudi production stood at 10.316mln BPD in February, according to industry sources, which is a slightly higher figure than the Platts survey on Thursday which reported output at 10.15mln BPD from the key OPEC producer. Baker Hughes (March 8): oil rigs -9 at 834, nat gas rigs -2 at 193, total rigs -11 at 1027.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.2% at 2743, NDX -0.2% at 7016, DJI -0.1% at 25448. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -1.9%, Materials +0.2%, Industrials -0.3%, Cons Discretionary -0.7%, Cons Staples +0.1%, Healthcare -0.2%, Financials 0.0%, Tech 0.0%, Telecoms -0.1%, Utilities +0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Costco (COST) surged on Friday on the release of its earnings report where it beat on EPS estimates, and reported an easing of margin pressures. The energy complex nosedived, primarily due to the dip in crude prices; worth noting Norway’s sovereign wealth fund also announced its plans to cut its stake in oil companies, which included Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP). Gilead Sciences (GILD) caught a bid on promising study results from HIV treatments. National Beverage (FIZZ) tanked after a disappointing earnings report. Netflix (NFLX) suffered from a downgrade at Buckingham, who cite investor angst over Disney’s (DIS) approaching streaming service. Horizon Pharma (HZNP) benefitted from an upgrade at Morgan Stanley, who say the co.’s entry into rare diseases isn’t appreciated enough.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 122-24+.</strong> As the Tsy complex wraps up for the week, the T Note future has added only 3+ ticks at settlement, despite the NFP headline mis which took the June contract to highs of 122-31, and then snap to lows around 122-19, before continuing its sideways grind at relatively unchanged levels. There was buying after the Europeans had left for the week, which took the contract form around 122-21 to around 122-26. At settlement, major curve spreads were slightly narrower, but under 1bps.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> A partial reprieve for the single currency, at least in USD and GBP terms, as the former is undermined by a significantly weaker than expected headline NFP print and the latter by no Brexit backstop breakthrough following the latest round of talks between UK and EU officials. However, Eur/Usd remains rooted to the lows of the week within a circa 1.1395-1.1185 range after stubborn resolve around the 1.1300 handle was finally broken by the ECB via the launch of TLTRO mark 3 and revised rate guidance to signal unchanged benchmarks through year end from at least after Summer 2019 previously. President Draghi delivered the rationale at the post-meeting press conference and during the Q&amp;A, but the bottom line is that the downturn in economic activity is now deemed to be sustained and widespread, and this was reflected in the updated March Staff forecasts via especially large downgrades to 2019 growth and inflation. Sources then compounded the dovish developments with suggestions that some GC members believe the GDP projection for this year may still be too optimistic, while even the more hawkish faction are said to have raised no real objections to the policy actions as waiting longer would not make sense.</p><p><strong>* AUD/NZD:</strong> The Aussie suffered a similar, albeit not as painful in absolute terms fate as the Euro amidst more dismal data and the RBA underlining its neutral stance, with nuances towards the balance of probability shifting from 50-50 between tightening and easing as the next move. Governor Lowe effectively removed a hike from the 2019 agenda and after GDP data showing the nation in a per capita recession, a herd of banks joined Westpac’s aggressive at the time call for 2 cuts this year, and one predicting back-to-back reductions of 25 bp. Aud/Usd got to within a whisker of 0.7000 vs 0.7100+ at one stage ahead of a 1.5 bn option expiry at the strike in the up to the NY cut, but pared losses on the aforementioned post-US jobs data Greenback downturn. Conversely, the Kiwi is actually close to ending a turbulent week back up around 0.6800 and not far from where it started or the peak (0.6830), partly as the Usd pulled back, but mainly due to favourable cross-winds as Aud/Nzd tested the water below 1.03500.</p><p><strong>* JPY/CHF: </strong>A solid showing by the renowned safe-haven currencies on Friday, but over the week quite a different story as the Jpy has sharply outperformed on a broad deterioration in risk sentiment due to heightened global growth jitters. Indeed, Usd/Jpy retreated from a series of tops around 112.00 and just above the big figure through key chart support at the 200 DMA (111.39) and under 111.00, while Yen crosses have also recoiled markedly. Conversely, Usd/Chf has rebounded back above parity all the way to 1.0100+ before waning and even though the Franc has netted gains vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Another week of Brexit watching for the Pound, as noted above, with Cable initially boosted by high/rising hopes of a breakthrough on the Irish backstop as Barclay and Cox headed to Brussels for more talks. However, the negotiations failed to deliver and the mood was described as tense with robust arguments put forward by either side, but the bottom line is that EU officials were left sceptical about the prospects of reaching any new agreement by the end of the week, or even in time for the March 21-22 Summit after offering an option that did not satisfy the UK delegation. The Attorney General was reportedly asked to re-write his proposal and talks are ongoing through today, over the weekend, with PM May now scheduled to see EC President Juncker next Monday, just a day before the voting begins again in Whitehall – meaningful on March 12, then no deal and extension on consecutive days thereafter if the former is rejected again (which latest straw polling suggests). Cable plumbed new depths for the week around 1.3020 from circa 1.3275 at best, but got a late boost from unsubstantiated remarks suggesting EU’s Barnier may be willing to offer Britain a unilateral get out from the customs union.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie has endured a torrid week due several negative factors including a ramp up in diplomatic tensions between Canada and China, a relatively pronounced retracement in oil prices and a more uncertain/cautious BoC that acknowledged last week’s disappointing Q4 growth figures and the fact that this puts the economy on a weaker footing for the first 3 months of 2019, if not longer. Usd/Cad duly rallied from sub-1.3300 to 1.3450+ before fading after Friday’s NA jobs data revealed almost 3 times as many jobs created in Canada vs the US in February, plus positive comments on the USMCA front as US President Trump claimed the deal is done and ready to be passed to Congress.</p><p><strong>* SEK/NOK: </strong>The Scandi Crowns have not been immune to the overall deterioration in risk appetite, and faint signs that the Riksbank may not be as certain about pressing ahead with further policy normalisation in H1 this year added to the dovish Central Bank vibe, if not narrative. Meanwhile, the Nok was also a victim of crude’s demise and not helped by Norway’s SWF deciding to phase out energy investments. Eur/Sek firmly above 10.6000 vs sub-10.5000 at the lows and Eur/Nok closer to 9.8800 than 9.7370.</p><p><strong>* COMING-UP: Monday: </strong>Eurogroup meeting.<strong> Tuesday: </strong>Brexit Meaningful Vote (TBC), ECOFIN meeting, UK GDP, US CPI. <strong>Wednesday: </strong>Eurozone Industrial Production, US PPI.<strong> Thursday: </strong>BoJ Rate Decision, US Retail Sales.<strong> Friday: </strong>Eurozone CPI (final), NY Fed Mfg, Uni of Michigan (Prelim), US JOLTS (Jan), US Industrial Production. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21344/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p><p><strong>* Central Bank Weekly:</strong> Previewing BOJ; Reviewing ECB, RBA, BOC, CBRT. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21343/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: ECB headlines CB dove-fest, while Brexit and broad risk sentiment sours",
        "content": "<p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>A partial reprieve for the single currency, at least in <strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong> terms, as the former is undermined by a significantly weaker than expected headline NFP print and the latter by no Brexit backstop breakthrough following the latest round of talks between UK and EU officials. However, Eur/Usd remains rooted to the lows of the week within a circa 1.1395-1.1185 range after stubborn resolve around the 1.1300 handle was finally broken by the ECB via the launch of TLTRO mark 3 and revised rate guidance to signal unchanged benchmarks through year end from at least after Summer 2019 previously. President Draghi delivered the rationale at the post-meeting press conference and during the Q&amp;A, but the bottom line is that the downturn in economic activity is now deemed to be sustained and widespread, and this was reflected in the updated March Staff forecasts via especially large downgrades to 2019 growth and inflation. Sources then compounded the dovish developments with suggestions that some GC members believe the GDP projection for this year may still be too optimistic, while even the more hawkish faction are said to have raised no real objections to the policy actions as waiting longer would not make sense.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie suffered a similar, albeit not as painful in absolute terms fate as the Euro amidst more dismal data and the RBA underlining its neutral stance, with nuances towards the balance of probability shifting from 50-50 between tightening and easing as the next move. Governor Lowe effectively removed a hike from the 2019 agenda and after GDP data showing the nation in a per capita recession, a herd of banks joined Westpac’s aggressive at the time call for 2 cuts this year, and one predicting back-to-back reductions of 25 bp. Aud/Usd got to within a whisker of 0.7000 vs 0.7100+ at one stage ahead of a 1.5 bn option expiry at the strike in the up to the NY cut, but pared losses on the aforementioned post-US jobs data Greenback downturn. Conversely, the Kiwi is actually close to ending a turbulent week back up around 0.6800 and not far from where it started or the peak (0.6830), partly as the Usd pulled back, but mainly due to favourable cross-winds as Aud/Nzd tested the water below 1.03500.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>A solid showing by the renowned safe-haven currencies on Friday, but over the week quite a different story as the Jpy has sharply outperformed on a broad deterioration in risk sentiment due to heightened global growth jitters. Indeed, Usd/Jpy retreated from a series of tops around 112.00 and just above the big figure through key chart support at the 200 DMA (111.39) and under 111.00, while Yen crosses have also recoiled markedly. Conversely, Usd/Chf has rebounded back above parity all the way to 1.0100+ before waning and even though the Franc has netted gains vs the Euro.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Another week of Brexit watching for the Pound, as noted above, with Cable initially boosted by high/rising hopes of a breakthrough on the Irish backstop as Barclay and Cox headed to Brussels for more talks. However, the negotiations failed to deliver and the mood was described as tense with robust arguments put forward by either side, but the bottom line is that EU officials were left sceptical about the prospects of reaching any new agreement by the end of the week, or even in time for the March 21-22 Summit after offering an option that did not satisfy the UK delegation. The Attorney General was reportedly asked to re-write his proposal and talks are ongoing through today, over the weekend, with PM May now scheduled to see EC President Juncker next Monday, just a day before the voting begins again in Whitehall – meaningful on March 12, then no deal and extension on consecutive days thereafter if the former is rejected again (which latest straw polling suggests). Cable plumbed new depths for the week around 1.3020 from circa 1.3275 at best, but got a late boost from unsubstantiated remarks suggesting EU’s Barnier may be willing to offer Britain a unilateral get out from the customs union.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie has endured a torrid week due several negative factors including a ramp up in diplomatic tensions between Canada and China, a relatively pronounced retracement in oil prices and a more uncertain/cautious BoC that acknowledged last week’s disappointing Q4 growth figures and the fact that this puts the economy on a weaker footing for the first 3 months of 2019, if not longer. Usd/Cad duly rallied from sub-1.3300 to 1.3450+ before fading after Friday’s NA jobs data revealed almost 3 times as many jobs created in Canada vs the US in February, plus positive comments on the USMCA front as US President Trump claimed the deal is done and ready to be passed to Congress.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns have not been immune to the overall deterioration in risk appetite, and faint signs that the Riksbank may not be as certain about pressing ahead with further policy normalisation in H1 this year added to the dovish Central Bank vibe, if not narrative. Meanwhile, the Nok was also a victim of crude’s demise and not helped by Norway’s SWF deciding to phase out energy investments. Eur/Sek firmly above 10.6000 vs sub-10.5000 at the lows and Eur/Nok closer to 9.8800 than 9.7370.</p>",

Overnight the Shanghai Composite (-4.4%) was at its worst level in 5 months; also exacerbated by poor Chinese trade data. Sectors are broadly in the red, with the automobile sector lagging on the aforementioned Chinese trade data and growth concerns. Significantly underperforming its peers at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are GVC Holdings (-17.0%) after the Co’s CEO sold 2.1mln worth of shares alongside the Chairman selling 900k shares; with both sales at the price of GBP 6.66/shr. Elsewhere, and towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are Azimut (+2.1%) benefiting from being upgraded at Kepler Cheuvreux. Elsewhere, following the Norwegian government stating the sovereign wealth fund should cut energy stocks from the investment benchmark, there was an immediate negative reaction in energy names including Total (+0.6%), BP (-1.5%) and Shell (-1.9%).</p><p>FX</p><p>JPY - The traditional and enduring safe haven currency is outperforming amidst heightened risk off sentiment, as worrying Chinese trade data and an unexpected decline in German manufacturing orders exacerbate global growth concerns. Usd/Jpy has subsequently retreated further from 112.00+ highs to just under 111.00, and through key technical support in the shape of the 200 DMA at 111.39.</p><p>DXY - The index and Greenback overall have succumbed to a bout of broad profit-taking and consolidation along with the aforementioned stronger demand for the Yen, as attention turns towards the looming NFP report and at least partly away from Thursday’s dovish ECB policy moves. The DXY has duly backed off from a new 2019 peak at 97.711 to straddle the 97.500 level as G10 (and EM) counterparts claw back some lost ground.</p><p>NZD/AUD - Although risk aversion has been stoked by the factors noted above, short-covering and cross-positioning have protected the Antipodean Dollars from further depreciation and fall-out. In fact, the Kiwi has rebounded firmly enough from recent lows to vie with the Jpy at the top of the major league as its Aussie peer remains depressed following recent worrying data that has prompted yet another bank to predict 2 RBA rate cuts this year. Nzd/Usd is back up over 0.6775 and Aud/Nzd slips below 1.0350, as Aud/Usd languishes between 0.7028-04 with a hefty 1.5 bn option expiry at the 0.7000 strike exerting another gravitational pull.</p><p>EUR/CHF - Some respite for the single currency and Franc, with Eur/Usd pivoting 1.1200 after testing a key chart support at 1.1187 on follow-through selling in wake of the ECB’s decision to offer more TLTROs and delay rate hikes. However, the headline pair looks hemmed in by option expiries at 1.1220-25 (1.6 bn) and 1.1250 (2.6 bn), and with nothing significant on the downside in terms of technical levels until 1.1110-33, aside from another expiry at 1.1150 (1 bn). Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is in a tight band around 1.0100 and now eyeing NFP for the next directional lead.</p><p>GBP/CAD - Marginal underperformers, with Cable looking increasingly bearish after losing grip of 1.3100 and hopes of a Brexit breakthrough appearing more and more forlorn as the latest EU offer on the backstop is not deemed sufficient to appease the majority of UK MPs that rejected the WA at the 1st time of asking. The Loonie has stabilised somewhat after its midweek collapse on a more cautious and uncertain BoC, but remains on the backfoot vs its US rival around 1.3450 ahead of jobs data from both sides of the NA divide.</p><p>SEK/NOK - The Scandi crowns are both weaker vs the Eur and Usd, with the former ruffled by comments from Riskbank’s Floden expressing surprise at the Sek’s recent decline and the fact that the ECB’s policy actions in March will be taken into account when the Swedish Central Bank meet at the end of next month. A rebound in household spending and upward revisions to back data has nudged Eur/Sek off the highs, but the pair remains above 10.6000, while a deeper retreat in oil prices is undermining the Nok, as Norway’s SWF pulls the plug on energy stocks in its benchmark portfolio. Eur/Nok currently around 9.8500.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Although off best levels, the core Eurozone bond has regrouped again after another bout of consolidation that briefly dragged prices below parity. However, Gilts continue to underperform and just slipped to a new, albeit very marginal Liffe low of 127.14 and EZ peripheral paper has unwound quite a bit of dovish ECB premium and outperformance vs Bunds/OATs as spreads edge back in. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are rooted near the base of their overnight ranges with the curve incrementally steeper as NFP looms.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent (-1.7%) and WTI (-1.6%)</strong> prices are continuing to extend upon their losses, as global growth concerns weigh on risk tone; both WTI and Brent are trading at the bottom of the sessions range, with WTI prices dropping under USD 56.00/bbl to the downside exacerbating the price decline; with session lows of around USD 55.80/bbl. Looking ahead we have the Baker Hughes Rig count, a decline in the crude rig count would be the third consecutive week of oil rigs decline; and as such may provide some reprieve to Brent and WTI prices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gold (+0.6%)</strong> is shining as the yellow metal benefits from the global growth concerns which are dominating markets. With gold at the top of it’s USD 10/oz range, trading around USD 1294.60/oz. Conversely, copper prices are down afflicted by the poor Chinese trade data exacerbating growth concerns in the worlds largest importer of the metals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The traditional and enduring safe haven currency is outperforming amidst heightened risk off sentiment, as worrying Chinese trade data and an unexpected decline in German manufacturing orders exacerbate global growth concerns. Usd/Jpy has subsequently retreated further from 112.00+ highs to just under 111.00, and through key technical support in the shape of the 200 DMA at 111.39.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and Greenback overall have succumbed to a bout of broad profit-taking and consolidation along with the aforementioned stronger demand for the Yen, as attention turns towards the looming NFP report and at least partly away from Thursday’s dovish ECB policy moves. The DXY has duly backed off from a new 2019 peak at 97.711 to straddle the 97.500 level as G10 (and EM) counterparts claw back some lost ground.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Although risk aversion has been stoked by the factors noted above, short-covering and cross-positioning have protected the Antipodean Dollars from further depreciation and fall-out. In fact, the Kiwi has rebounded firmly enough from recent lows to vie with the Jpy at the top of the major league as its Aussie peer remains depressed following recent worrying data that has prompted yet another bank to predict 2 RBA rate cuts this year. Nzd/Usd is back up over 0.6775 and Aud/Nzd slips below 1.0350, as Aud/Usd languishes between 0.7028-04 with a hefty 1.5 bn option expiry at the 0.7000 strike exerting another gravitational pull.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some respite for the single currency and Franc, with Eur/Usd pivoting 1.1200 after testing a key chart support at 1.1187 on follow-through selling in wake of the ECB’s decision to offer more TLTROs and delay rate hikes. However, the headline pair looks hemmed in by option expiries at 1.1220-25 (1.6 bn) and 1.1250 (2.6 bn), and with nothing significant on the downside in terms of technical levels until 1.1110-33, aside from another expiry at 1.1150 (1 bn). Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is in a tight band around 1.0100 and now eyeing NFP for the next directional lead.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>Marginal underperformers, with Cable looking increasingly bearish after losing grip of 1.3100 and hopes of a Brexit breakthrough appearing more and more forlorn as the latest EU offer on the backstop is not deemed sufficient to appease the majority of UK MPs that rejected the WA at the 1st time of asking. The Loonie has stabilised somewhat after its midweek collapse on a more cautious and uncertain BoC, but remains on the backfoot vs its US rival around 1.3450 ahead of jobs data from both sides of the NA divide.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandi crowns are both weaker vs the Eur and Usd, with the former ruffled by comments from Riskbank’s Floden expressing surprise at the Sek’s recent decline and the fact that the ECB’s policy actions in March will be taken into account when the Swedish Central Bank meet at the end of next month. A rebound in household spending and upward revisions to back data has nudged Eur/Sek off the highs, but the pair remains above 10.6000, while a deeper retreat in oil prices is undermining the Nok, as Norway’s SWF pulls the plug on energy stocks in its benchmark portfolio. Eur/Nok currently around 9.8500.</p>",

Looking ahead, Friday’s domestic agenda is barren and Brexit looks set to take a back seat for once given no scheduled meetings with EU officials, although talks are bound to be ongoing ahead of PM May and EC President Juncker next get together on Monday (on the eve of UK’s Parliament’s 2nd meaningful vote). More immediately, the monthly US jobs data will likely form the pre-weekend highlight, as usual.</p>",

Yields were lower by between 4bps and 6bps, at settlement, led by the belly. A bout of profit-taking after the European close did little to halt the march higher, which was further aided by the slide in US stocks. The stock slide seemed to stabilise around half an hour before the cash close, which lent some negative ticks to the T-Note. Friday's payrolls is now the next major catalyst for the complex.

ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) are lower with the top-weighted financials sector front-running the broad-based declines in Australia, while Japanese sentiment is dragged by a stronger currency with Kawasaki Kisen the worst hit after it widened its FY net loss guidance by fivefold to JPY 100bln. Hang Seng (-1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) have also slumped with early underperformance seen in the mainland in which the CSI 300 slipped by the most so far this year of more than 3%, as concern regarding global growth took its toll and amid cautiousness ahead of the looming Chinese trade data.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firmly above the 97.00 level and was the main benefactor following the ECB’s dovish triple whammy, in which it announced a fresh round of TLTROs, cut growth forecasts and indicated that rates would be kept on hold through 2019 vs. Prev. guidance for rates to be kept on hold through summer. This saw EUR/USD decline over 2 points to below 1.1200 and GBP/USD relinquished the 1.3100 handle to the downside amid Brexit-related pessimism as only limited progress was said to have been made in discussions with the EU, which seemingly provided Morgan Stanley a more favourable entrance as it took a long GBP/USD position at the NY close with a target at 1.3650 and a stop at 1.2850. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are kept subdued by the risk-averse tone and due to flows into the JPY following better than expected GDP and Current Account figures from Japan, while antipodeans’ attempts to nurse losses are kept limited ahead of the key Chinese data and with a large option expiry in AUD/USD of 1.5bln at the 0.7000 level for Friday’s New York cut.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the gains in T-notes and amid declining yields in the aftermath of the dovish ECB, while the widespread risk averse tone and BoJ presence in the market in the short-end also contribute to support for government bonds.&nbsp;</p>",
