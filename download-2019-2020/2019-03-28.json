Furthermore, the reports added that the plan is part of a package of offers on technology-related issues Chinese negotiators are expected to discuss with their US counterparts during high-level meetings scheduled for Friday and under the proposal, foreign providers would be able to own data centers as part of a pilot in a free-trade zone.

(Newswires/BBC/Twitter)</p><p>UK government ministers privately suggested a general election will be called if Friday's vote is rejected or things \"fall apart\", according HuffPost's Paul Waugh. Elsewhere, there were comments from House Speaker Bercow that the new government motion meets his tests and only covers withdrawal agreement, while Sun's Tom Newton Dunn reports it will occur at 14:30GMT/10:30EDT.

Williams also commented that he is not as worried about the chances of a recession as some in the private sector and stated that the yield curve inversion has historically pointed to a recession but that may not be the case today, while he also doesn't believe governments can run large deficits indefinitely without consequences.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Accenture (ACN) outperformed on Thursday after beating earnings estimates and providing optimistic&nbsp; guidance. Nielsen (NLSN) nosedived after the Blackstone Group (BX) withdrew its buyout offer. Lululemon (LULU) surged to record levels on the back of stellar earnings guidance. PVH Corp (PVH) also made large gains after strong guidance. Amarin (AMRN) caught a bid on the back of the American Diabetes Association commenting positively on its fish oil treatment. Wabco (WBC) sold off sharply after it agreed to sell itself to a German competitor. Five Below (FIVE) surged on beating earnings estimates. Ford (F) traded higher after it was announced it would be collaborating with Volkswagen on a truck. Western Digital (WDC) benefitted from an Outperform initiation at RBC. A weak US Pending Home Sales data release saw homebuilders (LEN, PHM, DHI TOL) take a dip. Sprint (S) underperformed following reports it said it would suffer without the T-Mobile (TMUS) merger. SPX +0.36% at 2815, NDX +0.17% at 7320, DJI +0.36% at 25717.</p><p>The curve was mixed at settlement, with 2s5s a touch steeper, though other major curve spreads narrowed (5s30s by as much as 5bps). There was optimism about US/China trade talks, which saw some flattening in European trade. Treasuries took some influence from the Bund after German inflation was short of expectations. There was little reaction after data showed US GDP in Q4 was revised lower. The Treasury's 7s auction was decent, stopping through by 0.9bps, with cover above recent averages; there was reported short-covering after the auction. Fed's Williams -- like the Fed's Daly earlier in the week -- suggested that the yield curve inversion might not necessarily portend a recession; previously some FOMC members have argued that the size of the Fed's balance sheet makes presents challenges for this signal as portending a recession. US T-note futures (M9) settled 6 ticks lower at 124-16.</p>",

The plan is part of a package of offers on technology-related issues Chinese negotiators are expected to discuss with their U.S. counterparts during the meetings scheduled for Friday. The article went on to specify that under the proposal, foreign providers would be able to own data centres as part of a pilot in a free-trade zone. However, China's Premier Li said that China must protect IP, a key area which the US wants to gain concessions on, to support China's transformation, adding that he does not think there is trust deficit between the US and China, hinting at a potential impasse from the negotiations; US administration officials had said previously that progress in all areas of trade talks had been made but enforcement and IP remain sticking points. Today also saw NEC Director Larry Kudlow make some comments, where he said that some, but not all, China tariffs may remain, and that the trade talks are not time dependent, suggesting that the US is in no rush to come to an agreement after having already postponed potential dates for a signing of a conclusive deal. Separately, Kudlow also said that Trump may take longer to consider the auto-tariff report, a case for implementing tariffs on European automakers which Commerce Secretary Ross submitted to him, a measure that if implemented would be sure to put a damp in US-EU relations.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Clarida (voter) said the Fed must pay ever closer attention to global growth risks, and it can be patient amid global risks and muted inflation. Clarida also said that if the US economy saw an adverse shock, its first response would be to use traditional policy tools (rates). Fed's Williams (voter) said the US economy was in a good place, but there was a reality that the economy was slowing, but back to a sustainable pace. Williams seemed unconcerned about suggestions of recession in the future, arguing that while an inverted Treasury curve pointed to recession, it might not be the case today (in the past, the Fed has often said that inversion signals may not mean the same as they have in previous economic cycles, given that the Fed's balance sheet holdings may distort the picture). Williams added that if the economy veered from the Fed's objectives, it would be a reason to rethink the policy path.</p><p><strong>* US GDP: </strong>Final US GDP for Q4 was revised down from 2.6% to 2.2%, below the expected 2.4% and feeding the narrative that the world’s number one economy is losing steam; however YoY growth for 2018 was still a strong 3%, “something that virtually any other developed market would desperately love to have,” analyst at ING Economics taunt. Looking into the sub-components, consumption, investment and government spending were all revised lower, but net exports were revised higher, breaking the trend, due to fewer imports. Wells Fargo Economics forecast “further deceleration in the first quarter, but… then look for a modest rebound starting in Q2.” The Atlanta Fed GDPNow for Q1 is currently supporting a fading growth stance, where it raised to 1.5% (prev. 1.3%) on the back of Wednesday’s trade figures, albeit still a decline from Q4; participants will be paying close attention to how soft data plays out in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>February’s<strong> </strong>Pending Home Sales fell by 1%, a tad under the expected 0.7% increase, and a reversal from January’s 4.3% jump, but more broadly, “the downward trend of last year appears to have been broken,” Pantheon Macroeconomics’ analysts note, “Activity was sharply depressed in 2018 by the capping of state and local tax deductions, but perhaps a new, lower equilibrium now has been reached.”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Wednesday evening in London saw all eight proposed Brexit motions failing to meet a majority, highlighting the complete fracture amongst MPs on how exactly they would like the UK to leave the EU (if at all). It was reported today that another vote will be held tomorrow, this time a government motion where MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement from PM May’s deal; note however that this is not the anticipated Meaningful Vote 3, which would be a vote on both the WA and the political declaration. HoC speaker Bercow approved the vote, citing that the motion may be voted on as the WA shows differences this time around in comparison to the previous Meaningful Vote 2. If approved by parliament, UK government sources say that the WA would meet the EU’s conditions for an extension of Article 50 to May 22nd; conversely, if the motion is rejected, or if things “fall apart”, ministers were privately suggesting a general election will be held. Following this newsflow, it was reported a senior EU official spoke positively on the developments, saying, “only the withdrawal agreement is a must have for the orderly withdrawal. The political declaration is a nice to have,” showing the possibility of a May 22nd Brexit, but of course this is all highly subject to change.</p><p><strong>* SARB REVIEW:</strong> The South African Reserve Bank left rates unchanged at 6.75%, as was expected, but the central bank's statement was relatively dovish, leading analysts to believe that its next rate move could be a cut (perhaps in the early part of 2020). Money markets seem to have given a nod to this thinking, and no longer see any rate hikes, though it is yet to price in any cuts over the next year. The governor himself sounded dovish, and policymakers - like other major central banks - are focussed on risks to the growth outlook. The SARB is also paying attention to the ECB and Fed, which have pivoted dovish this year, which has the possibility of seeing a relative tightening in SA. Also, similar to the Fed, the SARB seems as though it will look through inflation risks; the governor sees risks as \"balanced\" now, after previously seeing them as \"moderately to the upside\".</p><p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>The Mexican central bank held benchmark rates unchanged at 8.25%, in an unanimous decision. It stated that the balance of risks to growth was tilted towards the downside, and inflation risks had an upward bias, amid an environment of marked uncertainty. The central bank also said that medium an long-term macro risks mean it is important that the govt meets its fiscal targets set out in the 2019 budget. The central bank will be paying special attention to uncertainty, pass-through of FX on prices, as well as relative monetary policy with the Fed.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED USD 0.11 LOWER AT USD 59.30/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLED USD 0.01 LOWER AT USD 67.82/BBL. </strong>Crude prices continued to sell off on Thursday, pressured by global growth concerns, a potentially less-compliant Russia, as well as Trump attempting to jawbone prices lower. Profit-taking continued on the back of US Q4 final GDP being revised lower to 2.2%, as well as underwhelming inflation data out of Germany. Oil futures took a leg lower after Trump tweeted \"very important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high,\" renewing his criticism of high oil prices, similar to a few weeks back; analysts note that Trump's playbook of calling out high oil prices usually comes when prices are near highs, although the efficacy of his critiques are less pronounced than they have been in the past. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak reportedly told Saudi energy minister Al-Falih that he cannot guarantee an extension of the production cuts until the end of the year, and he reportedly went on to say a 3-mopnth extension from the June meeting could be agreed upon. Analysts at Citi said \"in addition to the downside pressure from doubts regarding Russian supply restraint, we also see book squaring as a factor ahead of Friday contract expirations in May Brent crude oil, April heating oil, and April RBOB gasoline.\"</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.36% at 2815, NDX +0.17% at 7320, DJI +0.36% at 25717. SECTORS: Energy +0.37%, Materials +0.95%, Industrials +0.77%, Cons Discretionary +0.58%, Cons Staples +0.42%, Healthcare +0.26%, Financials +0.83%, Tech +0.38%, Telecoms -0.50%, Utilities -1.25%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Accenture<strong> </strong>(ACN)<strong> </strong>outperformed on Thursday after beating earnings estimates and providing optimistic&nbsp; guidance. Nielsen (NLSN) nosedived after the Blackstone Group (BX) withdrew its buyout offer. Lululemon (LULU) surged to record levels on the back of stellar earnings guidance. PVH Corp (PVH) also made large gains after strong guidance. Amarin (AMRN) caught a bid on the back of the American Diabetes Association commenting positively on its fish oil treatment. Wabco (WBC) sold off sharply after it agreed to sell itself to a German competitor. Five Below (FIVE) surged on beating earnings estimates. Ford (F) traded higher after it was announced it would be collaborating with Volkswagen on a truck. Western Digital (WDC) benefitted from an Outperform initiation at RBC. A weak US Pending Home Sales data release saw homebuilders (LEN, PHM, DHI TOL) take a dip. Sprint (S) underperformed following reports it said it would suffer without the T-Mobile (TMUS) merger.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 6 TICKS LOWER AT 124-16. </strong>The curve was mixed at settlement, with 2s5s a touch steeper, though other major curve spreads narrowed (5s30s by as much as 5bps). There was optimism about US/China trade talks, which saw some flattening in European trade. Treasuries took some influence from the Bund after German inflation was short of expectations.

Profit-taking continued on the back of US Q4 final GDP being revised lower to 2.2%, as well as underwhelming inflation data out of Germany. Oil futures took a leg lower after Trump tweeted \"very important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high,\" renewing his criticism of high oil prices, similar to a few weeks back; analysts note that Trump's playbook of calling out high oil prices usually comes when prices are near highs, although the efficacy of his critiques are less pronounced than they have been in the past. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak reportedly told Saudi energy minister Al-Falih that he cannot guarantee an extension of the production cuts until the end of the year, and he reportedly went on to say a 3-month extension from the June meeting could be agreed upon. Analysts at Citi said \"in addition to the downside pressure from doubts regarding Russian supply restraint, we also see book squaring as a factor ahead of Friday contract expirations in May Brent crude oil, April heating oil, and April RBOB gasoline.\"</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: DXY comfortably sits above 97.000 whilst the TRY loses composure  ",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>A solid day of gains for the broad dollar and index (so far) amidst declining US Treasury yields. The index extended gains above 97.000, benefiting from the overall weakness in its G10 and EM pairs and also possibly with the aid of better-than-forecast jobless claims. DXY traded within a 96.82-97.29 band but with a few of Fed speak still ahead with voter Williams set to speak twice ahead of the US close. Note: USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin are to start high level trade talks in Beijing tonight ahead of a full day of dialogue tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling the marked underperformer amidst the seemingly never-ending Brexit debacle. The parliamentary timetable is changing on a day-by-day basis, with the latest reports stating the PM May has decided to put the Withdrawal Agreement alone to a Commons vote tomorrow, without the Political Declaration. Nevertheless, House Speaker Bercow will ultimately decide, although ministers are confident that he will agree, as it is said to be different to MV2. GBP/USD has thus far fluctuated within a relatively wide 1.3076-3208 range having briefly dipped below its 50 DMA at 1.3086. Elsewhere, disappointing German regional CPIs set the stage for a national forecast miss, in turn pressuring the single currency, with EUR/USD breaching through chart support at 1.1241, having traded within a 50-pip intraday range (1.1214-64). Participants will be eyeing tomorrow’s German retail sales and unemployment and potential comments from ECB’s Coeure for more direction on the economy.</p><p><strong>SEK, NOK, CAD</strong></p><p>Not the best start to the day for the Scandi Crowns, although the NOK and SEK have pared back a bulk of the losses as risk sentiment improved. EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK are poised to end European trade closer to the bottom of their respective intraday ranges with the former having fluctuated within a 9.7020-7465 band (having briefly breached its 50 and 100 DMAs at 9.7233 and 9.7373), whilst the latter is set to end the day around its 50 DMA at 10.4558 (having traded within a 10.4250-5050 range). Elsewhere the Loonie was largely dictated by price action in the energy complex and is set to end the European session little changed above 1.3400 vs. the greenback ahead of Canadian GDP tomorrow.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>A turnaround in risk sentiment has prompted marginal weakness in the safe-haven FX pairs with USD/JPY poised to end EU trade closer to the top of its intraday range of 110.03-82 ahead of last week’s high of 110.96. Similarly, USD/CHF remains above its 100 DMA at 0.9965 and briefly breached 0.9970 to the upside heading into the EU close.</p><p><strong>TRY, ZAR, BRL</strong></p><p>Another troubled day for the Turkish Lira despite the London swap rate returning to 25% (vs. 1200% yesterday) and the CBRT raising total TRY swap rate to 30% (Prev. 20%) for swap transactions that have not matured. The Lira is set to end EU trade with losses in excess of 4% against the Greenback which followed verbal intervention from Turkish President Erdogan as he piled pressured on the Central Bank to cut interest rates to “deal with inflation”, although the imprisonment of the US consulate worker in Turkey does not bode well for the Turkish currency following its demise the last time a US citizen was detained.</p><p>Elsewhere, the South African Central Bank unanimously stood pat on its repo rate at 6.75% as expected. The rand was little changed in the immediate aftermath of the decision despite the downgrades in 2019/2020 GDP forecasts alongside 2020/2021 inflation expectations (2019 inflation forecasts were maintained), weakness was mostly attributed to the rise in the Buck although downside in the ZAR coincided with reports that state-owned Eskom suspended operations in the Garankuwa region amid protests. Note: Moody’s is set to review South Africa’s credit rating tomorrow with some expecting an adjustment.</p><p>Finally, BRL remained the outperforming EM currency despite its central bank downgrading GDP forecast to 2% (Prev. 2.4%) as the currency takes its cue from the optimistic developments in pension reforms. The country’s President noted today that the reforms are moving ahead as planned whilst the central bank governor stated he is confident the pension reforms will be approved. Hence the Brazilian Real trades around 0.5% firmer against the Greenback.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%)</strong> were also cautious with weakness in financials due to earnings in which China’s 2nd largest lender China Construction Bank missed on FY net forecasts and posted its first quarterly Y/Y profit decline since 2015 which doesn’t bode well for the other Big 4 banks to report this week, while China Life Insurance also posted a near-65% drop in FY net. Nonetheless, sentiment in China slightly improved as US and China senior trade negotiators began the latest round of trade talks in Beijing and a Trump administration official suggested progress was made in all areas of trade talks but some sticking points remained. Finally, 10yr JGBs were supported by the negative risk tone in Japan and amid the recent bond market rally as global yields declined in which the US 10yr yield fell to a fresh 15-month low and the Aussie 3yr yield printed its lowest on record, while the results of today’s 2yr auction were also bullish as all metric improved from the prior month, albeit marginally.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Sector-wise, material stocks lead the gains as base metals benefit from recent turnaround in the risk sentiment whilst utility names lag as investors move away from defensive sectors. In terms of notable movers, Swedbank (-3.7%) shares took another hit amid the slew of open investigations in relation to money laundering.

Usd/Jpy is holding above 110.00 within a 110.03-53 range having tested bids/support just ahead of the big figure where decent option expiry interest resides (1 bn) and is back above daily chart resistance between 110.07-12, while Eur/Jpy has also rebounded from sub-124.00 lows and heavy Japanese selling that pushed the cross down through a key Fib (123.81) at one stage.

UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.6%) outperforms its peers as the weaker domestic currency bolsters the export-heavy index. Sector-wise, material stocks lead the gains as base metals benefit from recent turnaround in the risk sentiment whilst utility names lag as investors move away from defensive sectors. In terms of notable movers, Swedbank (-3.7%) shares took another hit amid the slew of open investigations in relation to money laundering. As the bank’s AGM gets underway, it announced that CFO Anders Karlsson has replaced Birgitte Bonnesen as acting President and CEO.&nbsp; Company shares are halted until further notice.

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>The best G10 performers, albeit off best levels as the Usd retains a firm underlying bid in its own right as a safe-haven amidst a tentative and intermittent revival in broad risk appetite. Usd/Jpy is holding above 110.00 within a 110.03-53 range having tested bids/support just ahead of the big figure where decent option expiry interest resides (1 bn) and is back above daily chart resistance between 110.07-12, while Eur/Jpy has also rebounded from sub-124.00 lows and heavy Japanese selling that pushed the cross down through a key Fib (123.81) at one stage. Meanwhile, the Kiwi has regained some composure after its post-RBNZ rout to reclaim 0.6800 status, but Nzd/Usd remains vulnerable following a marked deterioration in NZ business sentiment and expectations according to ANZ’s March survey, which provides more justification for the change in rate guidance towards an ease vs a neutral stance previously. Note, RBNZ Governor Orr is due to orate later on the new framework for monetary policy.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also weathering a bout of downside pressure relatively well, as the Aussie keeps tabs on the 0.7100 handle vs its US counterpart and remains above 1.0400 against the Nzd, however Aud/Usd could be hampered by a 1 bn expiry ahead of the NY cut along with dovish positioning for next week’s RBA on the notion that the balance of risks could shift towards cutting benchmark rates from a balanced prognosis at present, ala the RBNZ. Meanwhile, the single currency succumbed to spill-over Jpy cross sales vs the Usd that forced the headline pair through recent lows and chart support (at 1.1241), but not much further as it consolidates back above the 76.4% Fib retracement of the 1.1177-1.1448 move.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>All lagging their major peers, and especially the Pound, Swedish and Norwegian Crowns. Cable has fallen below a fairly resilient 1.3150 mark following the latest UK Parliamentary votes on Brexit ended with no majority support for any of the 8 options tabled, and in fact resounding rejection in 6 instances, leaving the situation even more uncertain than it was before the HoC took the baton from PM May. Meanwhile, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have both bounced further in wake of yesterday’s worse than expected Norwegian jobs data and as Swedbank suffers more investor angst over money laundering allegations, with the former up to 9.7465 and latter at 10.4935 before easing back. The Loonie is also weaker post-data, between 1.3400-30 vs its US rival, with the Franc still somewhat mixed as it pivots 0.9950 vs the Greenback and 1.1200 against the Euro in advance of a speech from SNB’s Maechler that could fan speculation about intervention to curb excess Chf strength/demand.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index has climbed into a higher range after recent declines amidst falling US Treasury yields and deeper curve inversion to probe above 97.000, and from a technical perspective the Buck may be able to overcome residual month end flows that are said to be mildly bearish.</p>",

(Newswires/Twitter)</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> remained near its best levels in 2 weeks and continued to eye the 97.00 level to the upside as the cautious risk tone underpinned demand for safe-haven currencies, which was more evident in <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was uneventful with prices stuck at the 1.1250 level where a large option expiry resides for today’s New York cut and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> slipped below 1.3200 on Brexit uncertainty. This was as hopes PM May could garner enough support for her Brexit deal after her promise to step down, were eventually dashed by the DUP which will vote against the deal citing a threat to the integrity of the UK, while GBP was further dampened after Parliament voted against all Brexit options in the indicative votes.

This saw the curve bull steepen. There was focus on a German 10yr auction, which sold at negative yields for the first time since 2016.The long-end of the yield curve continued to test new lows (lowest in over a year), with participants continuing to note that the 30-year bucket is the only part of the curve with its head above the effective fed funds rate. On that note, the 3m/10y inversion deepened to over 10bps on Wednesday trade; the market has been rationalising these moves with more circumspection, though concerns about the growth outlook are clearly evident. Next week’s survey data and jobs data may provide the next major catalyst for the narrative to be tweaked. Meanwhile, the belly of the curve saw decent action; in early trade a block sale of the FVM9 in 5k was followed by a large sale (15k); later in the session, some desks had reported real money was profit taking in the belly. US T-note futures (M9) settled 9 ticks higher at 124-22.</p><p><strong>Fed's George (Voter, Hawk)</strong> said Fed can take a wait-and-see approach on monetary policy given notable downside risks to the economy and that medium-term risks to the economy is from slower growth in China, EU and UK. Fed’s George also commented the Fed is not using balance sheet as a policy tool and does not discuss balance sheet run-off as ‘tightening policy’, while she expects a rebound in payrolls for March and added that US economic growth is likely to slow to 2.0% this year as fiscal and monetary stimulus fades and amid slower global growth.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly negative as the downbeat sentiment rolled over from US where all major indices finished lower amid lingering growth concerns and as the yield curve inversion deepened. As such, ASX 200 (+0.7%) opened subdued but with losses eventually pared by resilience across nearly all sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) underperformed and briefly slipped below the 21000 level with selling exacerbated by a firmer currency and rotation into bonds. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) were also cautious with weakness in financials due to earnings in which China’s 2nd largest lender China Construction Bank missed on FY net forecasts and posted its first quarterly Y/Y profit decline since 2015 which doesn’t bode well for the other Big 4 banks to report this week, while China Life Insurance also posted a near-65% drop in FY net. Nonetheless, sentiment in China slightly improved as US and China senior trade negotiators began the latest round of trade talks in Beijing and a Trump administration official suggested progress was made in all areas of trade talks but some sticking points remained. Finally, 10yr JGBs were supported by the negative risk tone in Japan and amid the recent bond market rally as global yields declined in which the US 10yr yield fell to a fresh 15-month low and the Aussie 3yr yield printed its lowest on record, while the results of today’s 2yr auction were also bullish as all metric improved from the prior month, albeit marginally.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly negative with the downbeat sentiment rolling over from the US where all major indices finished lower amid lingering growth concerns and as the yield curve inversion deepened. As such, ASX 200 (+0.3%) opened subdued but with losses eventually pared by resilience in mining names, while Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) underperformed and briefly slipped below the 21000 level with selling exacerbated by a firmer currency and rotation into safety assets. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are also weaker with financials underperforming due to earnings in which China’s 2nd largest lender China Construction Bank missed on FY net forecasts and posted its first quarterly Y/Y profit decline since 2015 which doesn’t bode well for the other Big 4 banks to report this week, while China Life Insurance also posted a near-65% drop in FY net. Nonetheless, the losses in the broader market have been stemmed as US and China senior trade negotiators began the latest round of trade talks in Beijing and a Trump administration official suggested progress was made in all areas of trade talks although enforcement and intellectual property remain sticking points.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains near its best levels in 2 weeks and continues to eye the 97.00 level to the upside as the negative risk tone underpins demand for safe-haven currencies, which is more evident for the JPY with USD/JPY and JPY-crosses pressured across the board. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is uneventful with prices stuck at the 1.1250 level where a large option expiry resides for today’s New York cut and GBP/USD has slipped below 1.3200 on Brexit uncertainty. This was as hopes of PM May’s Brexit deal passing, following her promise to step down once Brexit is delivered, were eventually dashed by the DUP which will vote against the deal citing a threat to the integrity of the UK, while GBP was further dampened after Parliament voted against all Brexit options in the indicative votes. Antipodeans were initially subdued due to their high-beta characteristics and with NZD/USD also weighed by a further deterioration in Business Surveys but later showed some resilience as risk sentiment across the Tasman began to improve. Elsewhere, some EM currencies have taken a hit with BRL testing 5-month lows amid domestic pension reform concerns and weakness across LATAM, while TRY was also spooked after a crackdown on speculation against the currency resulted in the overnight borrowing rate for the currency in the offshore swap market briefly rocketing past 1000%.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher to track the upside in T-notes as global yields decline in which the US 10yr yield fell to fresh 15-month low and the Aussie 3yr yield at record lows, while focus now turns to a 2yr JGB auction later.</p>",
