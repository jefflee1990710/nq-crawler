Sarapeta Therapeutics (SRPT) were hit after it was revealed in an FDA statement its SRP-1001 drug had safety issues. Symantec (SYMC) spiked over 10% with Broadcom (AVGO) close to acquiring the company, AVGO were initially lower by over 1% but closed positive. Viacom (VIAB) had earnings where they beat on both EPS and revenue, however, when asked about the CBS merger in the conference call, the co. did not comment despite source reports earlier in the week stating further announcements could be seen in the conference call. Elsewhere, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) completed its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) reported Q2 earnings which beat expectations; however, the packaged foods maker was as it disclosed another USD 1.2bln write-down, adding to the USD 15bln charge it took earlier in the year. S&amp;P 500 1.9% AT 2938, NASDAQ-100 2.3% AT 7725, DJIA 1.4% AT 26381.</p><p>Trade wars, low inflation, and commentary suggesting neutral rates may be lower than previously seen has been driving the rally in bonds this week, but the rally paused on Thursday after the PBOC overnight weakened the yuan fix by less than models had suggested. The curve was bear steepening in early trade, and yields saw further upside in sympathy with EGBs, on reports that Germany was mulling raising issuance; the report was denied by the Germans, and the Bund gradually pared back the knee-jerk downside. The US sold 30-year bonds sold at 2.335%, tailing 1.2bps. Cover picked up from the prior, and came in in line with recent averages; dealer participation fell from the prior, though was a touch short t=of the recent average; direct participation fell versus the prior, but was still short of the six auction averages. Indirect participation recovered to above 60%, rising from the prior and above recent averages. After the auction, T-Note futures continued rose, though still end the day with yields higher across the curve (2s +4bps, 5s +3.4bps, 10s +2.6bps, 30s +4.4bps). US T-note futures (U9) settled 7+ ticks lower 129-29+.</p>",

Perhaps bonds have been assisted by the rise in crude, where the Saudis appear to be discussing measures with international partners to stabilise the crude market and will reportedly not tolerate a continued slide in oil prices. There is a disjointed feel to markets: havens still retain their bid, despite firmer equities; however, the Treasury curve has yields higher across the board.</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>China’s central bank weakened the yuan reference point, fixing it above 7.00 against the USD for the first time since 2008, although was not weakened as much as some models had foreseen. The market has been eying the fix for insight on what constitutes a ‘comfortable’ level for the PBOC. UBS notes that although the PBOC has stepped up measures to slow the yuan’s pace of depreciation (including: introducing a larger counter cyclical factor, issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong to manage liquidity, pledging to keep the yuan stable) the market remain concerned about further weakening. “Today’s fixing is a clear message that China doesn’t mind letting its currency depreciate beyond any specific number, but would like to control the pace it weakens and mitigate market volatility as ‘stability’, which is PBoC governor Yi Gang's main goal.” The bank believes that upward pressure on USDCNH is likely to persist in the near-term.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>The trade surplus narrowed, but the pace of export growth rose unexpectedly in July on the back of stronger exports to non-US nations. Declining exports to the US moderated a slightly, but analysts still suggest that this implies that the drag from US Tariffs continued to intensify. The decline of imports also was better than expected, which CapEco says is consistent with evidence that headwinds to the domestic economy eased. “Looking ahead, exports still look set to remain under pressure in the coming quarters as any prop from a weaker renminbi should be overshadowed by further US tariffs and broader external weakness,” according to Capital Economics, “though August exports may benefit from front-loading before the new tariffs go into effect on September 1st, this bump will probably be smaller than it was ahead of earlier rounds of tariffs as US port storage facilities have little spare capacity.” The consultancy does not think that the recent fiscal easing will be enough to prevent a renewed slowdown in domestic demand, which will likely weigh on import volumes.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY FISCAL U-TURN: </strong>Germany is reportedly considering a fiscal policy U-turn, possibly jettisoning its balanced budget goal, and mulls new debt to finance climate production spending. The report stated that Berlin will link the new issuance to climate measures, in order to ensure that ensure the \"budget floodgates\" are not opened up. The exact amount of issuance will be known once German Chancellor Merkel's climate protection package, which will be unveiled next month. The German government declined to comment on the report, and a spokesperson later said that there no decision had yet been taken on giving up a balanced budget.</p><p><strong>* US JUNE WHOLESALE INVENTORIES: </strong>There was an unexpected downward revision to wholesale inventories in June. Goldman Sachs said the data shifted the composition of growth from the second to the third quarter, and accordingly, it lowered its past-quarter GDP tracking estimate for Q2 by one tenth to +1.9% (qoq ar, compared to +2.1% as originally reported) but boosted its Q3 GDP tracking estimate by the same amount, also to +1.9%.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The Bund/BTP spread widened to over 210bps on Thursday, after the League Party threatened to quit the coalition government. League’s Salvini said it is now necessary to hold fresh elections as there is no longer a majority to support the government. 5SM’s Di Maio responded saying they are ready for elections and Salvini will pay for taking Italy for a ride. Frictions between the League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement party have escalated in recent hours, Stratfor reported, leading to rumours that the League may leave the government, or at least demand a Cabinet reshuffle to increase its influence on policy. There is some focus on the economy minister Tria, who is seen as a moderate technocrat, amid rumours the League want him sacked. The League’s withdrawal from the government would not necessarily lead to an early general election, as Italian President Sergio Mattarella is likely to ask the parties in Parliament to appoint a new government before deciding to hold an early election, Stratfor said; The President has been keen for the 2020 budget preparations to proceed, in order that it can be presented to lawmakers in October.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLES 7+ TICKS LOWER 129-29+. </strong>Trade wars, low inflation, and commentary suggesting neutral rates may be lower than previously seen has been driving the rally in bonds this week, but the rally paused on Thursday after the PBOC overnight weakened the yuan fix by less than models had suggested. The curve was bear steepening in early trade, and yields saw further upside in sympathy with EGBs, on reports that Germany was mulling raising issuance; the report was denied by the Germans, and the Bund gradually pared back the knee-jerk downside. The US sold 30-year bonds sold at 2.335%, tailing 1.2bps. Cover picked up from the prior, and came in in line with recent averages; dealer participation fell from the prior, though was a touch short t=of the recent average; direct participation fell versus the prior, but was still short of the six auction averages. Indirect participation recovered to above 60%, rising from the prior and above recent averages. After the auction, T-Note futures continued rose, though still end the day with yields higher across the curve (2s +4bps, 5s +3.4bps, 10s +2.6bps, 30s +4.4bps)</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson may hold General Election day after Brexit on 1st November, The Sun reported. The plan would allow Johnson to tell voters he has delivered Brexit. Aides reportedly think that holding a vote hours after the UK has quit Europe would give the Conservatives a boost from Leave voters. The news follows suggestions that opposition leader Corbyn is preparing to hit Johnson with a no confidence vote as soon as Parliament returns in September. Later, UK Foreign Minister Raab reiterates UK will leave EU in October, government would prefer to leave with a deal, but if EU is not flexible, UK will leave on WTO terms.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLES USD 1.45 HIGHER AT USD 52.54/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 1.15 HIGHER AT USD 57.38: </strong>Oil prices were firmer on Thursday, with the market finding support after a bout of excessive selling. The bounce was catalysed not long after the energy settlement on Wednesday, when comments from Saudi Arabia suggested the OPEC kingpin is considering all options to stabilise the oil market. Earlier on Thursday, a Saudi official doubled down, saying it is willing to do “whatever it takes” to keep the market balanced, and jawboned that the Kingdom is seeing healthy demand and that concerns are “overplayed”. How much power Saudi has left regarding coordinating supply cuts from OPEC+ remains up for debate, after the latest OPEC+ meeting proved to be a struggle to ensure supply cut commitments from all members (especially Russia). However, fellow OPEC member UAE echoed Saudi’s comments later in the session, saying that it will continue to support actions that balance the oil market. Elsewhere, and also providing support to the crude complex, China’s July trade data showed a 14% increase in crude imports (compared to July 2018), despite a weaker Yuan.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1.9% AT 2938, NASDAQ-100 2.3% AT 7725, DOW JONES 1.4% AT 26381; S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 2%, Consumer Staples 1.2%, Energy 2.9%, Financials 1.7%, Health Care 1.4%, Industrials&nbsp; 1.7%, Information Technology 2.4%, Materials 1.9%, Telecommunication Services 2.2%, Utilities 1%.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A</strong>: Symantec (SYMC) spiked over 10% with Broadcom (AVGO) close to acquiring the company, AVGO were initially lower by over 1% but closed positive. Viacom (VIAB) had earnings where they beat on both EPS and revenue, however, when asked about the CBS merger in the conference call, the co. did not comment despite source reports earlier in the week stating further announcements could be seen in the conference call. Elsewhere, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) completed its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (APC).</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Kraft Heinz (KHC) reported Q2 earnings which beat expectations; however, the packaged foods maker was as it disclosed another USD 1.2bln write-down, adding to the USD 15bln charge it took earlier in the year. Booking Holdings (BKNG) was up on both EPS &amp; revenue beats Monster (MNST) fell after both EPS and revenue misses.</p><p><strong>* OTHER STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Advanced Macro Devices (AMD) was over 15% higher after it introduced its new Epyc server chip, which the chipmaker claims to be twice as fast as Intel’s (INTC) Cascade Lake Chip; INTC were initially lower by around 1%, however, as markets gained the stock clawed back losses and closed 1% higher; Altice (ATUS) was pressured in late trade as talks with Stonepeak reportedly collapsed, with regards to the selling of its stake in Lightpath. Sarapeta Therapeutics (SRPT) were hit after it was revealed in an FDA statement its SRP-1001 drug had safety issues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The dollar was knocked after Trump’s familiar criticism of the Fed and the US dollar, and the DXY heads into Asia with a slight negative bias. EUR continues to consolidate around the 1.12 area, though saw some neg ticks with the Italian government on the verge of collapse, and new elections being talked about; the bund/BTP spread blew out to over 210bps, once again exerting itself on the single currency. Havens <strong>JPY, CHF</strong>, and <strong>XAU</strong> were bid, with the yen falling sub-106, and gold retaining USD 1500, despite higher US yields and stocks trading higher. Risk sensitive currencies like the <strong>CAD, AUD, NZD</strong> bounced after reaching technically oversold levels; the <strong>RUB and NOK</strong> was also higher as crude advanced. GBP traded with an offered tone, though is back above 1.21, having fallen beneath the level after PM Johnson said he’d hold elections the day after Brexit if a no confidence emotion passed; <strong>GBP</strong> seemed, however, to be taking its cued from the USD. <strong>EMFX</strong> was also firmer amid the risk bounce and dollar weakness; <strong>BRL</strong> took cues from pension reform clearing the lower house unamended on Tuesday, while <strong>MXN, ZAR and TRY</strong> also firmed. Attention overnight will once again be on the PBOC’s yuan fix, after it was nudged to over seven for the first time since 2008 on Thursday – the fix has been quite influential on FX actions in European and US hours.</p><p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The Lira advanced to a four-month high, positive for the seventh day in ten; the upside has been attributed to thawing relations between the US/Turkey, while pricing for Fed rate cuts has also helped support. Longer-term factors have included the declining in inflation, as well as improving current account. Technicians note that the break of USDTRY 200dma to the downside this week gives scope for a bullish Lira view, with some desks now seeing the Turkish currency closer to 5.00. Inflation has been declining, and the country seems insulated from US/China trade wars, while yield differentials are also attractive, SocGen says.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The real firmed as pension reform clearing the lower house without amendments on Wednesday. Inflation data missed slightly, though the BRL seemed unaffected; headline IPCA was 0.19% in July vs expectations for 0.24%, the annual measure decelerated to a below target 3.22%. Core inflation was also lower than expected in July at 0.15%, while the annual core measure moderated further to 3.01%. Analysts had said that an inflation miss could leave the door open to further rate cuts from the BCB, which trimmed by a larger than expected 50bps last week.</p><p><strong>* MXN:</strong> Mexican inflation rose in line with expectations, driven by higher fresh food and services prices. However, the Y/Y measure eased by 0.1ppts to 3.8%, and the core measure was relatively unchanged. \"Headline inflation convergence to Banxico’s 3% mid-point objective proves slow as core inflation remains unresponsive to a widening output gap,\" Oxford Economics said, \"we forecast headline inflation at 3.6% by end-19, which could help Banxico to loosen its highly restrictive monetary stance as soon as the September meeting.\"</p>",

Indirect participation recovered to above 60%, rising from the prior and above recent averages.

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The dollar was knocked after Trump’s familiar criticism of the Fed and the US dollar, and the DXY heads into Asia with a slight negative bias. EUR continues to consolidate around the 1.12 area, though saw some neg ticks with the Italian government on the verge of collapse, and new elections being talked about; the bund/BTP spread blew out to over 210bps, once again exerting itself on the single currency. Havens JPY, CHF, and XAU were bid, with the yen falling sub-106, and gold retaining USD 1500, despite higher US yields and stocks trading higher. Risk sensitive currencies like the CAD, AUD, NZD bounced after reaching technically oversold levels; the RUB and NOK was also higher as crude advanced. GBP traded with an offered tone, though is back above 1.21, having fallen beneath the level after PM Johnson said he’d hold elections the day after Brexit if a no confidence emotion passed; GBP seemed, however, to be taking its cued from the USD. EMFX was also firmer amid the risk bounce and dollar weakness; BRL took cues from pension reform clearing the lower house unamended on Tuesday, while MXN, ZAR and TRY also firmed. Attention overnight will once again be on the PBOC’s yuan fix, after it was nudged to over seven for the first time since 2008 on Thursday – the fix has been quite influential on FX actions in European and US hours.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> China’s central bank weakened the yuan reference point, fixing it above 7.00 against the USD for the first time since 2008, although was not weakened as much as some models had foreseen. The market has been eying the fix for insight on what constitutes a ‘comfortable’ level for the PBOC. UBS notes that although the PBOC has stepped up measures to slow the yuan’s pace of depreciation (including: introducing a larger counter cyclical factor, issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong to manage liquidity, pledging to keep the yuan stable) the market remain concerned about further weakening. “Today’s fixing is a clear message that China doesn’t mind letting its currency depreciate beyond any specific number, but would like to control the pace it weakens and mitigate market volatility as ‘stability’, which is PBoC governor Yi Gang's main goal.” The bank believes that upward pressure on USDCNH is likely to persist in the near-term.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> The Lira advanced to a four-month high, positive for the seventh day in ten; the upside has been attributed to thawing relations between the US/Turkey, while pricing for Fed rate cuts has also helped support. Longer-term factors have included the decling in inflation, as well as improving current account. Technicians note that the break of USDTRY 200dma to the downside this week gives scope for a bullish Lira view, with some desks now seeing the Turkish currency closer to 5.00. Inflation has been declining, and the country seems insulated from US/China trade wars, while yield differentials are also attractive, SocGen says.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> The real was firmer on Thursday, on a mix of pension reform clearing the lower house without any amendments, with the bill now going to Senate. Inflation data missed slightly, though the BRL seemed unaffected; headline IPCA was 0.19% in July vs expectations for 0.24%, the annual measure decelerated to a below target 3.22%. Core inflation was also lower than expected in July at 0.15%, while the annual core measure moderated further to 3.01%. Analysts had said that an inflation miss could leave the door open to further rate cuts from the BCB, which trimmed by a larger than expected 50bps last week.</p><p><strong>* MXN: </strong>Mexican inflation rose in line with expectations, driven by higher fresh food and services prices. However, the Y/Y measure eased by 0.1ppts to 3.8%, and the core measure was relatively unchanged. \"Headline inflation convergence to Banxico’s 3% mid-point objective proves slow as core inflation remains unresponsive to a widening output gap,\" Oxford Economics said, \"we forecast headline inflation at 3.6% by end-19, which could help Banxico to loosen its highly restrictive monetary stance as soon as the September meeting.\"</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Oil prices were firmer on Thursday, with the market finding support after a bout of excessive selling. The bounce was catalysed not long after the energy settlement on Wednesday, when comments from Saudi Arabia suggested the OPEC kingpin is considering all options to stabilise the oil market. Earlier on Thursday, a Saudi official doubled-down, saying it is willing to do “whatever it takes” to keep the market balanced, and jawboned that the Kingdom is seeing healthy demand and that concerns are “overplayed”. How much power Saudi has left regarding coordinating supply cuts from OPEC+ remains up for debate, after the latest OPEC+ meeting proved to be a struggle to ensure supply cut commitments from all members (especially Russia). However, fellow OPEC member UAE echoed Saudi’s comments later in the session, saying that it will continue to support actions that balance the oil market. Elsewhere, and also providing support to the crude complex, China’s July trade data showed a 14% increase in crude imports (compared to July 2018), despite a weaker Yuan.</p>",

The bounce back was catalysed not long after the energy settlement yesterday when comments out of Saudi suggested the OPEC kingpin is considering all options for the oil market. Earlier on today&nbsp;a Saudi official doubled down, saying it is willing to do “whatever it takes” to keep the market balanced, and jawboned that the Kingdom is seeing healthy demand and that concerns are “overplayed”. How much power Saudi has left regarding coordinating supply cuts from OPEC+ remains up for debate, after the latest OPEC+ meeting proved to be a struggle to ensure supply cut commitments from all members (especially Russia). Elsewhere and also providing support to the crude complex is China’s July trade data, which showed a 14% increase in crude imports (compared to July 2018), despite a weaker Yuan.</li><li>Goldman Sachs has said that given there has been no signs of oil fundamentals materially worsening, the market is pricing in “too dire a growth outlook”. On a technical basis, the bank believes that the large sell-off since last Thursday has been fuelled by negative gamma effects due to prices falling through strikes of large open interest; additionally the large move has attracted trend-following flows to further exacerbate the difference between prices and fundamentals. Goldman concluded by saying it expects prices to remain volatile until there is clear evidence that end-demand is resilient.</li></ul>",

Upbeat Chinese trade data has been the catalyst, and certainly helped to divert attention from a 7.0039 Usd/Cny PBoC fix, albeit the reference not quite as expected again, with Aud/Usd now back above 06800 and even Nzd/Usd paring more losses towards 0.6500 as Aud/Nzd hovers around 1.0500.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Firmer oil prices amidst supportive Saudi pledges has helped the Loonie shrug off weaker than expected Canadian new home sale prices, as Usd/Cad remains closer to the base of a 1.3275-1.3315 range, and also assisted the Norwegian Krona regain some poise along with a broader recovery in risk sentiment with Eur/Nok probing 10.0000 bids. However, Eur/Sek has pulled back further from Wednesday’s highs towards 10.7300 on some technical retracement.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/GBP/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on course to end Thursday’s EU session narrowly mixed vs the Greenback with the Yen still not straying too far from the 106.00 axis and Euro only briefly recovering from a sub-1.1200 decline as Bund yields spiked on reports of new German debt issuance to fund climate initiatives. Conversely, the Pound has regrouped after a stop-fuelled break below 1.2100 and Eur/Gbp spike to 0.9265 as FT reports about a possible UK General Election soon after Brexit on October 31 recirculated and spooked Sterling. Meanwhile, the Franc has lost a bit more safe-haven appeal across the board as Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf extend upside ranges to 0.9580+ and 1.0955 respectively, undoubtedly to the relief of the SNB.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Mixed fortunes for the likes of the Lira, Real, Rand and Peso as Usd/Try resumed its downward trend after a fleeting pop above 5.5100 to test 5.4400 and Usd/Brl continued to cheer the passage of Brazil’s Pension Reform Bill with less arduous amendments, down through 3.9300 at one stage. In contrast, Usd/Zar rebounded from sub-15.0000 to revisit 2019 peaks just shy of 15.2000 amidst a raft of disappointing SA data, but roughly in line Mexican CPI did not impact Usd/Mxn as it hovered nearer the bottom of a 19.6520-5100 band.</p>",

Declining exports to the US moderated a slightly, but analysts still suggest that this implies that the drag from US Tariffs continued to intensify. The decline of imports also was better than expected, which CapEco says is consistent with evidence that headwinds to the domestic economy eased. “Looking ahead, exports still look set to remain under pressure in the coming quarters as any prop from a weaker renminbi should be overshadowed by further US tariffs and broader external weakness,” according to Capital Economics, “though August exports may benefit from front-loading before the new tariffs go into effect on September 1st, this bump will probably be smaller than it was ahead of earlier rounds of tariffs as US port storage facilities have little spare capacity.” The consultancy does not think that the recent fiscal easing will be enough to prevent a renewed slowdown in domestic demand, which will likely weigh on import volumes.</p>",

The market has been eying the fix for insight on what constitutes a ‘comfortable’ level for the PBOC. UBS notes that although the PBOC has stepped up measures to slow the yuan’s pace of depreciation (including: introducing a larger counter cyclical factor, issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong to manage liquidity, pledging to keep the yuan stable) the market remain concerned about further weakening. “Today’s fixing is a clear message that China doesn’t mind letting its currency depreciate beyond any specific number, but would like to control the pace it weakens and mitigate market volatility as ‘stability’, which is PBoC governor Yi Gang's main goal.” The bank believes that upward pressure on USDCNH is likely to persist in the near-term.</p>",

Declining exports to the US moderated a slightly, but analysts still suggest that this implies that the drag from US Tariffs continued to intensify. The decline of imports also was better than expected, which CapEco says is consistent with evidence that headwinds to the domestic economy eased. “Looking ahead, exports still look set to remain under pressure in the coming quarters as any prop from a weaker renminbi should be overshadowed by further US tariffs and broader external weakness,” according to Capital Economics, “though August exports may benefit from front-loading before the new tariffs go into effect on September 1st, this bump will probably be smaller than it was ahead of earlier rounds of tariffs as US port storage facilities have little spare capacity.” The consultancy does not think that the recent fiscal easing will be enough to prevent a renewed slowdown in domestic demand, which will likely weigh on import volumes.</p>",

(+0.9%) </strong>were positive with sentiment underpinned by relief after the PBoC announced the reference rate which was set beyond the 7.0000 level for the first time since 2008 but not as weak as expected, while participants also digested Chinese trade data which topped estimates across the board and still showed a significant, albeit narrower imbalance in US-China trade. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lower with mild pressure seen amid the improved risk tone in the region, although prices then returned flat with support seen amid firmer demand at the 10yr inflation-indexed auction.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Indices are posting broad-based gains, although UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.1%) lags its peers amid a slew of large cap ex-divs. Sectors are also in positive territory, although defensive sectors are somewhat lagging. Looking at individual movers, Adidas (-1.3%) shares opened lower by over 2% as investors for weeks sought an upgrade to guidance, particularly after its rival Puma (+2.5%) raised its sales and profit forecasts recently. Sticking with the DAX, Thyssenkrupp (+3.3%) shares rose despite an EBIT guidance cut as investors shifted focus to its elevator division IPO (expected in FY19/20) and expression of interests for other divisions. Finally, Osram Licht (-6.6%) slumped to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co’s largest shareholder rejected the EUR 3.4bln takeover offer form Bain &amp; Carlyle.

However, the index is still straddling 97.500 and from a technical perspective holding above key Fib support at 97.392 on a closing basis, if not intraday, and it remains to be seen if the latest upturn in sentiment proves more sustainable or transitory like on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/GBP/CAD - </strong>In keeping with the improved risk tone noted above, Aud/Usd has turned full circle and a bit more from midweek session lows towards 0.6800, but unlikely at this stage to reach hefty expiry options residing between 0.6840-50 (1.2 bn), while Nzd/Usd is still underperforming within 0.6468-35 parameters following more dovish RBNZ rhetoric on balance after yesterday’s double-barrelled ½ point OCR cut. Elsewhere, Cable is back around 1.2150 and the Loonie has rebounded through 1.3300 along side crude prices ahead of Canadian house price data.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/XAU - </strong>The safer-havens are off best levels, but interestingly and perhaps tellingly still relatively bid as the Yen contains losses below 106.00 to circa 106.30 with decent option expiry interest likely to cap further upside in Usd/Jpy given 1 bn running off from 106.45-55. Similarly, the single currency is holding above 1.1200, but also likely to be stymied by expiries as 2.4 bn awaits between 1.1230-40, while the latest ECB monthly bulletin is far from Euro supportive given a downbeat assessment of the Eurozone economy and outlook, albeit largely a repetition of President Draghi’s post-policy meeting text. Elsewhere, the Franc is pivoting 0.9750 and Gold is rangebound either side of Usd1500/oz.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>The Rand continues to underperform with Usd/Zar mostly above 15.0000 after recent technical breaks to the upside and with weaker than forecast SA mining data not helping.</p><p><strong>RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby said outlook for rates is more balanced after 50bps cut but added there is still some probability OCR will need to be reduced further</strong>, while Hawkesby also stated the central bank are watching inflation expectations closely and that unconventional tools are a contingency in the event inflation tanks although they would need to exhaust conventional policy tools first.

Meanwhile, <strong>Bunds </strong>are still hovering just shy of 177.00 in wake of the ECB’s Economic Bulletin that was largely in-line with the statement after July's policy meeting, but provided no further guidance next month's high stakes convene. Turning to the periphery, <strong>BTPs</strong> continue to underperform on renewed/heightened political friction and Friday’s Fitch rating call, while Stateside <strong>Treasuries</strong> are off overnight lows, but still unwinding recent bull-flattening awaiting further US-China developments and with one eye on initial jobless claims before the final auction of the week. On that note, after a softish 2 year sale Wednesday's 10 year results were weak so it will be interesting to see whether long bonds are deemed more attractive given the concession compared to yesterday's yield compression.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>A day of consolidation for the oil complex thus far after yesterday’s wave of downside in which the benchmarks declined almost 5% as demand concerns continue to materialise. <strong>WTI and Brent prices</strong> have rebounded off worst levels and reside around 52.23/bbl and 57.14/bbl respectively at the time of writing (vs. yesterday’s lows of 50.55/bbl and 55.90/bbl). The recent trade-induced sell-off has caught the attention of Saudi officials who are reportedly looking at options to stem the decline in the oil market.&nbsp; At the moment, no details of potential actions were mentioned, although desks note that anything else other than compliance control and further output cuts could be unrealistic, even then, reaching an OPEC+ consensus on further curbs could prove difficult given the debacle at the June meeting between the producers.

Elsewhere <strong>gold</strong> prices are tentative, albeit off its 6-year peak of 1510/oz and back below the psychological figure. Protectionism risk remains in the forefront for the yellow metal with trade sources noting that China expects the 10% levy on Chinese goods to be implemented on September 1 and thereafter be ramped up to 25% as China stands firm. Meanwhile, <strong>copper </strong>prices are flat on the day amid the cautiousness in the market, although the red metal did receive some short-lived impetus to test 2.60/lb to the upside as Chinese trade data topped estimates across the board, however, <strong>iron ore</strong> prices failed to benefit from the data amid ongoing supply glut and lower demand concerns.

Hence, the 'trend' remains the same after the pullback across the fixed complex, albeit less deep, with some sporadic upward momentum evident via Gilts printing a marginal new Liffe intraday high at 134.15 earlier. Meanwhile, Bunds are still hovering just shy of 177.00 in wake of the ECB’s Economic Bulletin that was largely in-line with the statement after July's policy meeting, but provided no further guidance next month's high stakes convene. Turning to the periphery, BTPs continue to underperform on renewed/heightened political friction and Friday’s Fitch rating call, while Stateside Treasuries are off overnight lows, but still unwinding recent bull-flattening awaiting further US-China developments and with one eye on initial jobless claims before the final auction of the week. On that note, after a softish 2 year sale Wednesday's 10 year results were weak so it will be interesting to see whether long bonds are deemed more attractive given the concession compared to yesterday's yield compression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Similarly, the single currency is holding above 1.1200, but also likely to be stymied by expiries as 2.4 bn awaits between 1.1230-40, while the latest ECB monthly bulletin is far from Euro supportive given a downbeat assessment of the Eurozone economy and outlook, albeit largely a repetition of President Draghi’s post-policy meeting text.

The 10 year UK benchmark was marked down 37 ticks initially at 134.06, but quickly relinquished the 134.00 handle on its way down to 133.89 before finding some underlying bids, while the 3 month strip has also pared losses from -1 to -5.5 ticks at worst to stand +0.5/-3 ticks around Wednesday’s settlement levels at present. No UK data or events scheduled for today, but a busy agenda tomorrow, so direction will be derived from elsewhere and dependent to large extent on whether or how long the current improved risk tone lasts.</p>",

Meanwhile, Italian BTPs are also factoring in renewed political premium within a 141.00-140.21 range vs yesterday’s 141.48 close as Rome’s coalition Government appears back on the brink of collapse ahead of Friday’s ratings review from Fitch. However, this underperformance is not really feeding into Bunds that remain below 177.00 compared to 177.19 at best and the 177.36 midweek session settlement, albeit off 176.68 lows. Ahead, the ECB monthly bulletin could give Eurozone debt a boost, if dovish as widely anticipated.</p>",

There was far more attention on the 3m/10-year spread, which inverted to over 40bps as global yields sank, taking the spread to the most inverted since 2007. Inspiring today’s price action was risk-off flows, as China fixed the yuan weaker, and RBNZ and RBI cut rates by more than expected, with the former citing the impact of global trade on its economy, and suggesting that NIRP could be an option ahead. Fed pricing on Wednesday was relatively unchanged looking through to the end of next year, where around 109bps of easing is priced. Fed’s Evans (dove, voter) hinted at more accommodation ahead, like his dovish colleague Bullard did early in the week, but was pushing a data-dependent line with regards to the September meeting – the implication is that all FOMC participants that have spoken this week have not explicitly alluded to a rate cut on 18th September, although they have not leaned back against market pricing, which is pricing 35bps of easing, suggesting that the market is still pricing a small chance of a double-barrel rate cut. Back to the Treasury complex, yields have pared back more than half of their fall, and it seems the driving factor was the aforementioned 3m/10-year spread coming off lows. US T-note futures (U9) settled 12+ ticks higher at 130-05.</p><p><strong>Fed's Evans (Voter, Dove)</strong> said the July cut was justified on the basis of low US inflation alone and that more accommodation is warranted, especially given economic headwinds. Evans added that brinkmanship trade negotiations means volatility and that close attention has to be paid, while he sees \"mid-cycle adjustment\" where the Fed is now targeting a rate 50bps below neutral, instead of 50bps above and sees long-run neutral rate as 2.75%, but may be lower now due to headwinds.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was initially subdued amid losses in its top weighted financials sector following earnings from AMP Capital and Insurance Australia Group but then conformed to the improved risk tone led by gold miners after the precious metal rallied above USD 1500/oz for the first time since 2013, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was underpinned by currency flows and KOSPI (+1.0%) outperformed after Japan approved some exports of tech materials to South Korea for the first time since curbs were imposed last month. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) were positive with sentiment underpinned by relief after the PBoC announced the reference rate which was set beyond the 7.0000 level for the first time since 2008 but not as weak as expected, while participants also digested Chinese trade data which topped estimates across the board and still showed a significant, albeit narrower imbalance in US-China trade. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lower with mild pressure seen amid the improved risk tone in the region, although prices then returned flat with support seen amid firmer demand at the 10yr inflation-indexed auction.</p>",

RBI revised 2019/20 GDP growth to 6.9% vs. Prev. 7.0%, sees headline inflation at 3.1% in Q2 FY20, 3.5%-3.7% in H2 FY20 and inflation to remain within target over a 12-month timeline.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as a firmer than expected PBoC reference rate setting helped the region shake off the initial tentativeness ahead of Chinese trade data and after the tumultuous day on Wall St, where stocks staged a dramatic intraday recovery in which the DJIA closed in the red but posted its largest rebound YTD. ASX 200 was initially subdued amid losses in its top weighted financials sector following earnings from AMP Capital and Insurance Australia Group but then conformed to the improved risk tone led by gold miners after the precious metal rallied above USD 1500/oz for the first time since 2013, while Nikkei 225 is underpinned by currency flows and KOSPI outperforms after Japan approved some exports of tech materials to South Korea for the first time since curbs were imposed last month. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. are positive with sentiment in the region underpinned by relief after the PBoC announced the reference rate which was set beyond the 7.0000 level for the first time since 2008 but not as weak as expected, while focus now turns to the looming Chinese trade data.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY flatlined during Asia hours with price action stuck around the 97.50 level and with uneventful trade observed across its major counterparts including EUR/USD which found a base at 1.1200 and with mild gains seen in GBP/USD as it oscillates within the prior day’s tight range, despite a latest poll suggesting it could slip to between 1.1700-1.2000 in the run up to the Brexit and that odds of a disorderly Brexit increased to 35% from 30%. Elsewhere, antipodeans nurse recent losses in which AUD/USD briefly recouped all of the prior day’s RBNZ-induced slump as it found solace from the improved risk tone and in tandem with a firmer than expected CNY fix, while NZD/USD still has far to go for a full recovery as bank officials kept the door open for additional cuts in which RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby noted the outlook for rates is more balanced after the 50bps cut but added there is still some probability OCR will need to be reduced further.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally lower with mild pressure seen amid the improved risk tone in the region and with participants sidelined ahead of a 10yr inflation-indexed auction.</p>",
