The Fed noted that while the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, coronavirus poses evolving risks to the economy. The statement added that the Committee was closely monitoring developments and would use all of its tools as well as act as appropriate to support the economy. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed Chair Powell said cut is used to keep the economy strong in the face of new risks which will weigh on the economy for some time, while he added risk to the US outlook have changed materially and the Fed will do its part to keep the economy strong as it meets this challenge. Powell also noted that the Fed has not looked at other measures just yet and the virus will require a multi-faceted response and believes actions will provide a meaningful boost. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump said he is working with congress and expects an USD 8.5bln emergency funding bill for the coronavirus and noted he is not looking at restricting domestic travel, but is mulling cutting off travel to other coronavirus \"hot spots\" and reiterated the Fed is following not leading. (Newswires)</p><p>World Bank announced a USD 12bln immediate financing package to help deal with coronavirus outbreak and said there are many unknowns regarding economic and health impact, while it also noted far more resources may be needed and that many have requested aid from World Bank although did not name them. (Newswires)</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mncuhin said G7 agreed to do \"everything possible\" to limit the harm from COVID-19, while he added that if there is a need to stimulate the US economy due to COVID-19, infrastructure is a priority. Mnuchin also commented that the virus is still evolving and task force set up may recommend special actions to help SMEs, while he added they are not mulling suspending China tariffs currently but will look at all options needed to help. (Newswires)</p><p>G7 is closely monitoring the spread of the disease and its impact on economic conditions, while it reaffirmed commitment to use tools to guard against downside risks. Furthermore, G7 ministers stand ready to take actions including fiscal measures where appropriate and G7 central banks will continue to fulfil their mandates. (Newswires)</p><p>Japan FinMin Aso said G7 response will vary from country to country, while French Finance Minister Le Maire said it is important to consider all measures including budgetary options in the face of coronavirus. However, there were other reports that EU Finance Ministers are unlikely to take any decisions during tomorrow's call on the coronavirus response, according to officials. (Newswires)</p><p>UK action plan on coronavirus stated it is possible that up to one fifth of employees could be absent from work during peak weeks, while it will consider closing schools, encourage home working and cut large scale gatherings. In related news, NHS England has declared coronavirus a \"Level 4 incident\" which is the highest level of emergency. (Newswires/Sky News)</p><p>ECB are carrying out work on a potential longer-term loan scheme for medium and small firms impacted by the coronavirus, according to sources which added that no decision is imminent. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>New Zealand Dairy Prices -1.2% (Prev. -2.9%). (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>Outgoing BoE Governor Carney said we are mulling a variety of policy options for the coronavirus and will take decisions at an appropriate time with its policy meeting after the March 11th budget. Furthermore, Carney noted that the MPC has always acted in a timely way and doesn't want to bind the committee in regards to timing when asked about changing rates before the March meeting, while he later added that if the UK economy was on track to achieve January growth forecasts, higher rates would be needed. (Newswires)</p><p>BoE's Ramsden said we stand prepared to look at additional liquidity measures to address the temporary shock from the coronavirus and that confidence has already been affected, while Ramsden also suggested that a potential 250bps of BoE policy loosening via rate cuts and QE would have the potential to make a significant contribution. (Newswires)</p><p>EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier said that negotiations with the UK are going well, according to Express' Barnes. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB’s Villeroy said if it is necessary the bank would stand ready to take appropriate and targeted measures, while he added that governments with fiscal space should use it and growth should remain positive for the Eurozone this year. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Holzmann said the bank must act accordingly but not overreact and suggested it is definitely an area for consideration but there is no urgency at the moment when asked if TLTRO was an option to provide support to businesses impacted by coronavirus. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Kazimir said it is important for the ECB to remain alert and that there is no imminent need to act but are ready to step in when and where necessary, while he added that panic and overreaction could cost us a lot. (Newswires)</p><p>German Economy Minister Altmaier said Germany will secure liquidity of companies, especially SME's and will use existing instruments such as state aid in shortened hours, guarantees, liquidity aid to strengthen consumer confidence and companies. (Newswires)</p><p>Riksbank's Breman said that if there was to be a serious economic crisis, a balance sheet expansion in their view would be closer to hand, while he noted that negative rates again are entirely possible and 0% is not regarded as a lower band but expressed caution over reintroducing negative rates. Furthermore, Bremen suggested that at present, the coronavirus isn't something that we can address with easier monetary policy although it does not mean if the downturn was more lasting they would not need to act. (Newswires)</p><p>SNB's Maechler says SNB is in talks with US officials over SNB's negative interest rate policy and readiness to intervene, while Maechler added SNB cannot undertake measures that are contrary to current SNB monetary policy and SNB is never under pressure but plans to discuss and potentially tweak its current assessment for moderate global economic growth at its next meeting in two weeks. Furthermore, she noted that SNB's policy rests on negative rates and readiness to intervene.

Mester added she will make her future decisions on policy in a meeting by meeting basis and look at latest coronavirus information, while she does not feel under political pressure on monetary policy and reiterated she is skeptical that negative rates would work well in the US. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>The Fed fired an emergency 50bps rate cut, which has lended to Treasury upside and a steeper yield curve, but the enthusiasm has not been shared in the equity complex, with stocks lower for the day. That might be a result of the fact that on Monday, markets were priced for 75bps of rate cuts at the March meeting alone, while the Fed only delivered 50bps of cuts today ahead of the March 18th confab, and the G7 statement on coordinated policy action provided little firm details and did not commit to any monetary or fiscal action, suggesting markets might be slightly disappointed thus far. Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn announced it expects a return to production normality by the end of March. Visa (V) joined PayPal (PYPL) and Mastercard (MA) and cut its guidance as a result of the coronavirus, as did Microchip (MCHP), Qorvo (QRVO) and Hyatt (H). Keysight (KEYS) however raised guidance, and Eli-Lilly (LLY) stated it does not anticipate a shortage of any of its products. Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Delta Airlines (DAL). SPX -2.8% at 3003, NDX -3.2% at 8595, DJ -2.9% at 25917.</p><p>Yields fell across the curve by between 3-12bps at settlement, with most of the declines being seen on the front-part of the curve; the shape of the curve steepened, with 2s30s widening by 9bps. The Fed's emergency 50bps rate cut was the drove most of the price action, and in the aftermath, there were fresh records for 10s and 30s yields, with the former falling beneath 1.00% for the first time ever. There is still pricing for further rate cuts ahead, with markets implying around 30bps of further easing through the end of the year. US T-note futures (H0) settled 23+ ticks higher at 136-00.</p>",

On alert for other policymaker responses.</li><li><strong>COMING UP:</strong> BoC &amp; NBP Monetary Policy Decision, Fed Beige Book; Japanese Services PMI, Australian Q4 GDP, Chinese Caixin Services PMI, Swiss CPI, EZ, UK, US Services &amp; Composite PMI (Final), US ISM Non-Manufacturing.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>The Fed fired an emergency 50bps rate cut, which has lended to Treasury upside and a steeper yield curve, but the enthusiasm has not been shared in the equity complex, with stocks lower for the day. That might be a result of the fact that on Monday, markets were priced for 75bps of rate cuts at the March meeting alone, while the Fed only delivered 50bps of cuts today ahead of the March 18th confab, and the G7 statement on coordinated policy action provided little firm details and did not commit to any monetary or fiscal action, suggesting markets might be slightly disappointed thus far. That is not to say that further action is not coming; the RBA, for instance has hinted it will cut again, the Fed keeps its door open to further action, and the ECB has made similar noises, although seems to be leaning towards providing SMEs with liquidity facilities, rather than rate cuts (although money markets are priced for a 10bps cut next week). Some also suggest that an emergency rate cut is difficult to interpret as an encouraging sign, and can be seen as panic, while hints of political interference erode the Fed's credibility. Additionally, the rate cut itself will do little to address the virus. In afternoon trade, Treasuries continued to rally, seeing fresh record lows for 10s and 30s yields, and equities saw downside; the price action came amid the CDC confirming more deaths in the US from the virus, a slew of banks cutting growth forecasts for a number of nations, while also increasing expectations of dovishness from global central banks; traders also discussed Fed credibility, and whether its moves could get the economy through the crisis. Looking ahead, it will be worth watching other central banks- particularly those whose currency is pegged to the USD – following the Fed and cutting rates.</p><p><strong>* FED EMERGENCY CUT: </strong>The Federal Reserve announced an emergency rate cut of 50bps, taking the fed funds target range to 1.00-1.25% in a unanimous decision. The Fed noted that, while the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, coronavirus poses evolving risks to the economy. The statement added that the Committee was closely monitoring developments and would use all its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In wake of the rate cut, there is around a 60% chance that the Fed follows its rate cut with another 25bps move lower at its March meeting; looking through to the end of the year, around 40bps of easing is priced.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>Powell was asked why the Fed acted in an emergency manner, given last week's statement was more sanguine, to which the Fed chair replied that the broader spread of the virus and the likely impact compelled the Fed to act. And while it is not fully showing up in data yet, the Fed has determined that economic risks have materially shifted. On the impact of the virus, Powell expressed uncertainty about its evolution, though did state it was likely to weigh on the economy for some time. Powell was also asked about what other tools the FOMC considered, and Powell said that the Fed had not looked at other measures just yet, arguing that virus will require a multi-faceted response, role for monetary policy remains as part of that; he also confirmed that there had been coordination with other G7 policymakers, and he expects to see action from those nations, but seemed to allude that the discussions with other global policy makers were merely that, and each nation will take action as it sees fit. Elsewhere, Powell said the cut would help give a boost to the economy and would help financial conditions from tightening further.</p><p><strong>* COORDINATED POLICY RESPONSE: </strong>Ahead of a call between G7 finance ministers and key central bankers, Reuters reported that the statement would not detail fiscal or monetary steps that the group would take in response to COVID19, source said. Instead, G7 nations would pledge to work together to mitigate the damage to their economies from the spread of the virus, while voicing their determination for joint coordinated action, if required. The report prepared traders for some disappointment, and was followed in European hours by a story which said the ECB was working on a scheme to provide funding for virus-hit SMEs (the report again did not allude to rate cuts as a response), which was then followed by a statement from the BOE, which again made noises about supporting the economy, though did not flag any immediate policy loosening. In later trade, Treasury secretary Mnuchin said he looks forward to an emergency funding package from Congress, which could be between USD 8bln, to deal with the spreading virus, and suggested he could ask for more funds. That Bill could come by Friday evening, some said. Mnuchin also said the Administration stood ready to work closely with Congress on an emergency funding package and any other related issues, and said the administration is mulling an infrastructure package as part of a broader stimulus measure, if needed. The Treasury secretary also said officials were considering measures to support businesses facing disruptions related to the virus, as well as workers who might not be entitled to sick leave. Meanwhile, there hasn’t been much pushback from Germany on fiscal stimulus; economy minister Altmaier said Germany will secure liquidity of companies, especially SME's, will use existing instruments such as state aid in shortened hours, guarantees, liquidity aid to strengthen consumer confidence and companies; however, analyst noted that Altmaier said the government will make use of existing instruments, somewhat leaning back on the notion of any fresh fiscal bazooka.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>The RBA became the first G10 central bank to cut rates in response to COVID19, although the bushfires and already slowing economic momentum would have played a role too. The central bank cut its cash rate target by 25bps, to 0.50%. The statement said the Board was prepared to ease monetary policy further to support the Australian economy, and as such, money markets are pricing another 25bps rate cut at the July meeting, which would take the cash rate target to 0.25%, and markets will then start the debate of when the RBA will launch a QE programme. Analysts at SocGen see the central bank announcing a government bond purchase programme in Q2, arguing that the conditions for QE -- a significant drop in the chances of achieving full employment and the inflation target -- are expected to be met soon, due to the negative impacts from COVID-19. Meanwhile, it was also notable that the statement hinted at upcoming fiscal stimulus by the government, which some have argued that this would likely not have been mentioned without any government commitments.</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW: </strong>The BOC is now expected to cut rates by at least 25bps at its March meeting (4th March, 1500 GMT/1000 ET). It is a statement only affair, however, governor Poloz will deliver remarks on Thursday after the release of the Economic Progress Report. In terms of the data, we have seen some stabilisation in recent metrics - the BOC had wanted to see evidence that a growth slowdown was persistent before it cut rates. However, the narrative has shifted, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, with major global central banks leaning dovish to cushion economies from the fallout. As such, the BOC has plenty of cover to cut rates, with some flagging risks of a deeper cut than the consensus implies.

Ahead of today's votes, prediction markets have implied that the chances of Bernie Sanders winning the nomination have fallen, while the prospects of former VP Joe Biden has been boosted by the dropping out of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar from the nomination race, with a great deal of their support likely to find its way into the Biden camp. Traders view Biden as a market-friendly outcome compared to Sanders, and Biden building momentum may therefore be slightly supportive of risk, some desks said, although virus concerns are likely to skew any of potential market reaction. RBC, citing investor feedback, said that up to a third of the recent US equity sell-off could be Sanders-related rather than due to COVID19, suggesting the outcome of Super Tuesday may yet influence risk sentiment.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE INFLATION: </strong>Headline inflation fell to 1.2% Y/Y, as expected, from 1.4%, with analysts suggesting that the fall was reflecting the decline in energy prices due to the COVID19 outbreak. The core measure rose to 1.4% from 1.3% (cons was also 1.3%), while the super core measure rose to 1.2%, in line with the expected, from a prior 1.1%. Analysts said that if the virus begins to impact activity in the months ahead, declines for the core measures may be on the cards. \"All told, it seems likely that inflation will be weaker this year than we and the ECB had expected, supporting the case for a policy response from the Bank,\" Capital Economics said.</p><p><strong>* SOUTH AFRICA RECESSION: </strong>Data confirmed the South African economy entered recession for the second time in two years, after growth contracted by a deeper than expected 1.4% Q/Q (cons -0.2%), with total 2019 growth coming in at 0.2%, the slowest since the GFC. There is not much to cheer about in the outlook, with the economy already under pressure amid load-shedding and soft domestic demand -- these factors will continue to put pressure on public finances, which some desks say will put the government under more pressure to cut wages (which will, of course, be met by industrial action), although South Africa has a poor record of implementing cuts. That in turn raises risks that Moody's will on 27th March downgrade South Africa's sovereign rating -- its last IG rating -- which will likely result in outflows between USD 20-30bln, some estimate. South Africa President Ramaphosa said today's data highlights the underlying weakness of South African economy, though he reiterated that the government remains committed to reducing public spending and managing public debt.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 23+ TICKS HIGHER AT 136-00. </strong>Yields fell across the curve by between 3-12bps at settlement, with most of the declines being seen on the front-part of the curve; the shape of the curve steepened, with 2s30s widening by 9bps. The Fed's emergency 50bps rate cut was the drove most of the price action, and in the aftermath, there were fresh records for 10s and 30s yields, with the former falling beneath 1.00% for the first time ever. There is still pricing for further rate cuts ahead, with markets implying around 30bps of further easing through the end of the year.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 0.43 HIGHER AT USD 47.18/BBL;</strong> <strong>BRENT (K0) SETTLES USD 0.04 LOWER AT USD 51.86/BBL: </strong>The crude complex saw choppy trade today amid the Fed’s emergency rate cut and a slew of OPEC+ sources reports, although the latter didn’t really provide any new information. Multiple sources front-ran OPEC+ announcement that it is to recommend between 600-1mln BPD of production cuts, in fitting with source reports last week. A weaker dollar from the rate cut, plus initial stimulus benefits saw initial upside for the benchmarks although gains proved short-lived as participants questioned the credibility of the Fed, and whether more easing will be seen. Citi highlighted the little direct impact it may have on physical oil consumption. Tonight’s private inventory expectations are (bbls): Crude +2.6mln, Cushing -1.5mln, Distillates -1.9mln and Gasoline -2.1mln.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> </strong>-2.8% at 3003,<strong> </strong>NDX -3.2% at 8595, DJ -2.9% at 25917. <strong>Sectors</strong>: Technology -3.8%, Financials -3.73% Communication -3.33%, Energy -3.1%, Health Care -2.5%, Industrials -2.4%, Consumer Discretionary -2.3%, Consumer Staples -1.4%, Utilities -1.2%, Materials -0.8%, Real Estate -0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn announced it expects a return to production normality by the end of March. Visa (V) joined PayPal (PYPL) and Mastercard (MA) and cut its guidance as a result of the coronavirus, as did Microchip (MCHP), Qorvo (QRVO) and Hyatt (H). Keysight (KEYS) however raised guidance, and Eli-Lilly (LLY) stated it does not anticipate a shortage of any of its products. Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Delta Airlines (DAL).</p><p><strong>*M&amp;A</strong>: Xerox (XRX) formally launched its tender offer to acquire outstanding HP Inc. (HPQ) shares for USD 24/shr, as previously announced. Thermofisher (TMO) and Qiagen (QGEN, QGE GY) announced its board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition proposal by TMO for EUR 39/shr, or USD 11.5bln. Sysco (SYY) reportedly approached Germany’s Metro (B4B GY) about a takeover, according to sources. AbbVie (ABBV) and Allergan (AGN) received final European approval for its merger, while the US FTC continues to review the transaction.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Target (TGT) beat on EPS, missed on revenue, reported SSS slightly above guidance and in line mediocre guidance. Kohl’s (KSS) saw a miss on EPS, beat on revenue, flat SSS and poor guidance. AutoZone (AZO) beat on EPS but missed on revenue, whilst highlighting the mild winter has impacted its sales.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD fell after the Fed fired an emergency 50bps rate cut, warning that the coronavirus spread was a \"material\" development that could weigh on the economy. As German/US rate differentials narrowed, the EUR surged, briefly topping 1.12. Havens rallied, with the yen falling beneath 107.00 briefly, as desks warn of potential BOJ action to follow the Fed. EURCHF is higher, although there are the usual suspicions about SNB intervention, while the central bank's Maechler was on the wires again warning that the SNB will intervene if it deems it necessary. XAU managed to touch USD 1650 but couldn't make any further headway towards the recent high. XXX/USD FX has generally been supported by USD downside, but the Aussie was also higher as the RBA 'only' cut by 25bps as markets were priced for a deeper cut (RBA also floated the potential for future action). CAD is weaker ahead of Wednesday's BOC, where a 25bps cut is the minimum action expected in the statement-only affair. EMFX was mixed; the ZAR was flat amid the dollar weakness as its economy entered recession for the second time in as many years. LatAm FX was under pressure as the virus spreads through Mexico and Brazil, while there were also some cautious corporate updates from the latter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In terms of the data, we have seen some stabilisation in recent metrics - the BOC had wanted to see evidence that a growth slowdown was persistent before it cut rates. However, the narrative has shifted, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, with major global central banks leaning dovish to cushion economies from the fallout. As such, the BOC has plenty of cover to cut rates, with some flagging risks of a deeper cut than the consensus implies. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/23998/download\"><strong>here</strong></a></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Fed emergency rate cut, and \"coordinated\" G7 action fails to boost risk sentiment; BOC on Wednesday",
        "content": "<p><strong>* COORDINATED POLICY RESPONSE: </strong>Ahead of a call between G7 finance ministers and key central bankers, Reuters reported that the statement would not detail fiscal or monetary steps that the group would take in repsonse to COVID19, source said. Instead, G7 nations would pledge to work together to mitigate the damage to their economies from the spread of the virus, while voicing their determination for joint coordinated action, if required. The report prepared traders for some disappointment, and was followed in European hours by a story which said the ECB was working on a scheme to provide funding for virus-hit SMEs (the report again did not allude to rate cuts as a response), which was then followed by a statement from the BOE, which again made noises about supporting the economy, though did not flag any immediate policy loosening.</p><p><strong>* FED EMERGENCY CUT: </strong>The Federal Reserve announced an emergency rate cut of 50bps, taking the fed funds target range to 1.00-1.25% in a unanimous decision. The Fed noted that, while the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, coronavirus poses evolving risks to the economy. The statement added that the Committee was closely monitoring developments, and would use all of its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>Powell was asked why the Fed acted in an emergency manner, given last week's statement was more sanguine, to which the Fed chair replied that the broader spread of the virus and the likely impact compelled the Fed to act. And while it is not fully showing up in data yet, the Fed has determined that economic risks have materially shifted. On the impact of the virus, Powell expressed uncertainty about its evolution, though did state it was likely to weigh on the economy for some time. Powell was also asked about what other tools the FOMC considered, and Powell said that the Fed had not looked at other measures just yet, arguing that virus will require a multi-faceted response, role for monetary policy remains as part of that; he also confirmed that there had been coordination with other G7 policymakers, and he expects to see action from those nations, but seemed to allude that the discussions with other global policy makers were merely that, and each nation will take action as it sees fit. Elsewhere, Powell said the cut would help give a boost to the economy, and would help financial conditions from tightening further.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>The RBA became the first G10 central bank to cut rates in response to COVID19, although the bushfires and already slowing economic momentum would have played a role too. The central bank cut its cash rate target by 25bps, to 0.50%, The statement said the Board was prepared to ease monetary policy further to support the Australian economy, and as such, money markets are pricing another 25bps rate cut at the July meeting, which would take the Cash Rate Target to 0.25%, and markets will then start the debate of when the RBA will launch a QE programme. Analysts at SocGen see the central bank announcing a government bond purchase programme in Q2, arguing that the conditions for QE -- a significant drop in the chances of achieving full employment and the inflation target -- are expected to be met soon, due to the negative impacts from COVID-19. Meanwhile, it was also notable that the statement hinted at upcoming fiscal stimulus by the government, which some have argued that the would likely not have been mentioned without any government commitments.</p><p><strong>* BOC (Weds, 1500 GMT/1000 ET): </strong>The BOC's rate decision comes amid hints of a coordinated G7 policymaker response to the COVID19 outbreak, in order to cushion the impact on the global economy. As a result, the market is heavily priced for a rate cut, with money markets implying that a 25bps lowering of the rate is a dead cert; and it might not end there, given that the market is set up for 75bps (three rate cuts) worth of easing through the end of the year. Analysts were closely watching the Q4/December GDP data for any signs that the slowdown in growth had become persistent - a condition that BOC Governor Poloz said he'd need to see before he could justify any rate cuts. That data, however, was in line with market expectations (as well as the BOC forecasts) at 0.3%, alluding to stability more than persistent downside, and would usually be expected to diminish the chances of a rate cut. However, like the RBA this week, the virus outbreak will likely be the driving factor of the BOC's policy decision. Just last Friday, there was around a 64% probability of a rate cut, but this week hints of coordinated policy action have seen pricing for rate cut probabilities in all major central banks tick up. It is a statement only affair, and analysts at HSBC say they were always looking for a dovish statement that highlights the downside risks to the economic outlook, while inflation has ticked up since its previous meeting in January. In that January meeting, the BOC noted that global downside risks had seemingly stabilized, while domestic risks had crystallized. HSBC expects the BOC to note that domestic downside risks to the economic outlook have been exacerbated by blockades that impeded a key rail corridor through much of February, and additionally, global downside risks have increased due to the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 virus. Governor Poloz will deliver the Economic Progress Report on 5th March, which will be followed by a press conference. Canadian bank Scotiabank, writing ahead of this week's hints of coordination, always expected the BOC to cut rates at this week's meeting, as well as at the April MPR meeting. \"The principle driver has always been developments in the domestic economy, but the coronavirus and its impact have raised our conviction that monetary easing would occur.\" Scotia notes oil prices are down almost 30% from earlier in the month as a result of the virus, and that represents a serious hit to the Canadian outlook, as does the sharp decline in equity prices. \"While there is a legitimate argument to make as to whether the virus represents a supply shock, it is abundantly clear that demand will be significantly weaker in the near-term, and that the output gap will widen materially,\" and due to the extended period of subpar growth in GDP and final domestic demand, the amount of slack in the economy is likely driving the output gap to over 1% in 2020H1 as the shock effect of COVID-19 hits, Scotia says. &nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>was idling either side of 97.500 in wake of the G7 communique conveying commitment and cooperation, but no coordination when headlines broke announcing an inter-meeting ½ point FOMC rate cut. The totally unexpected move, in terms of timing at least given proximity to the next scheduled policy meeting on March 18, took financial markets by surprise even though easing expectations were even more aggressive ahead of the emergency decision, with the index dipping below 97.000 and towards early January lows (96.818 and 96.418 from the 8th and 1st respectively). All eyes subsequent on a hastily arranged press conference from Fed chair Powell to explain the rationale and signal whether there is more room to counter evolving nCoV economic risks – see our headline feed from 16.00GMT for detailed coverage of the event and Q&amp;A.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Aussie was already probing fresh post-RBA peaks and poised to test technical and psychological resistance at 0.6600 and 1.0500 vs its US and NZ peers before the shock FOMC action, and Aud/Usd has now extended through the big figure to circa 0.6638. However, Aud/Nzd failed to sustain momentum above the aforementioned round number, as Nzd/Usd also rallied to a 0.6320+ high, so far after shrugging off declines in GDT Dairy and WMP prices. Elsewhere, the Yen was knocking on the door of resistance below 108.00 against the Greenback after surviving a couple of tests of double bottom support around 108.50, but has now breached 107.50 and tripped sub-107.27 stops on the way to 107.18 or so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/EUR/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All revelling in the post-US policy easing relief and Buck weakness, if not quite euphoria as the Franc maintains momentum above 0.9550, but trades flat on the Eur/Chf cross given the single currency scaling 1.1200 at one stage vs the Dollar. Similarly, Sterling is somewhat mixed with Cable back on the 1.2800 handle in contrast to Eur/Gbp revisiting 0.8700+ terrain amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty tinged with an element of early positivity via trade talks between the UK and EU, per Barnier. Meanwhile, more recovery gains for the Norwegian and Swedish Kronas even though the Euro is elevated as noted above, as the respective crosses eye 10.3000 and 10.5000 vs highs of 10.3870 and 10.6475 pre-FOMC.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Almost all change as the Fed induced Usd downturn helps regional currencies claw back losses, with even the SA ravaged Zar managing to register a net gain vs hefty slump to 15.6230+ at worst, while the Try has performed even better within a 6.2200-0335 band following the US envoy to Syria offering to arm Turkish forces at Idlib (rather than any real uplift from firmer than forecast inflation data).</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>was idling either side of 97.500 in wake of the G7 communique conveying commitment and cooperation, but no coordination when headlines broke announcing an inter-meeting ½ point FOMC rate cut. The totally unexpected move, in terms of timing at least given proximity to the next scheduled policy meeting on March 18, took financial markets by surprise even though easing expectations were even more aggressive ahead of the emergency decision, with the index dipping below 97.000 and towards early January lows (96.818 and 96.418 from the 8th and 1st respectively). All eyes subsequent on a hastily arranged press conference from Fed chair Powell to explain the rationale and signal whether there is more room to counter evolving nCoV economic risks – see our headline feed from 16.00GMT for detailed coverage of the event and Q&amp;A.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Aussie was already probing fresh post-RBA peaks and poised to test technical and psychological resistance at 0.6600 and 1.0500 vs its US and NZ peers before the shock FOMC action, and Aud/Usd has now extended through the big figure to circa 0.6638. However, Aud/Nzd failed to sustain momentum above the aforementioned round number, as Nzd/Usd also rallied to a 0.6320+ high, so far after shrugging off declines in GDT Dairy and WMP prices. Elsewhere, the Yen was knocking on the door of resistance below 108.00 against the Greenback after surviving a couple of tests of double bottom support around 108.50, but has now breached 107.50 and tripped sub-107.27 stops on the way to 107.18 or so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/EUR/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All revelling in the post-US policy easing relief and Buck weakness, if not quite euphoria as the Franc maintains momentum above 0.9550, but trades flat on the Eur/Chf cross given the single currency scaling 1.1200 at one stage vs the Dollar. Similarly, Sterling is somewhat mixed with Cable back on the 1.2800 handle in contrast to Eur/Gbp revisiting 0.8700+ terrain amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty tinged with an element of early positivity via trade talks between the UK and EU, per Barnier. Meanwhile, more recovery gains for the Norwegian and Swedish Kronas even though the Euro is elevated as noted above, as the respective crosses eye 10.3000 and 10.5000 vs highs of 10.3870 and 10.6475 pre-FOMC.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Almost all change as the Fed induced Usd downturn helps regional currencies claw back losses, with even the SA ravaged Zar managing to register a net gain vs hefty slump to 15.6230+ at worst, while the Try has performed even better within a 6.2200-0335 band following the US envoy to Syria offering to arm Turkish forces at Idlib (rather than any real uplift from firmer than forecast inflation data).</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Holzmann says the bank must act accordingly, but not overreact. When asked if TLTRO was an option to provide support to businesses impacted by coronavirus, says it is definitely an area for consideration but there is no urgency at the moment; would not currently support an interest rate reduction to help curb the impact from COVID-19. (Newswires)</p><p>Outgoing BoE Governor Carney at the Treasury Select Committee: role in coronavirus is to help the economy through a shock that will be large but temporary; will ensure that all necessary contingency plans are in place and steps are taken to support the UK economy. Monetary policy may be required to reinforce the expected recovery if signs of recovery are not sustained as early signs are encouraging but growth and inflation recovery is not assured. Should expect a response which has a mixture of fiscal and central bank elements - in the process of changing our assessment of the economic outlook; expect to see one or two quarters of economic impact from the virus. When asked about changing rates before the March meeting, says the MPC has always acted in a timely way - doesn't want to bind the committee in regard to timing.

This inspired a surge across the major US indices led by the DJIA which rose over 5% which was the most in over a decade and posted its biggest point gain on record of nearly 1300 points. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.7%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.2%)</strong> were lifted at the open with Tech and Healthcare frontrunning the broad sector gains in Australia and as markets also awaited the widely anticipated rate cut by the RBA, while the Japanese benchmark was less decisive and retraced all its gains amid detrimental flows into the currency. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (U/C)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%)</strong> were positive in which the latter breached the psychological 3000 level with sentiment supported by the global stimulus hopes and a continued decline in the pace of coronavirus cases in mainland China. Finally, 10yr JGBs slumped to below 153.50 on spill-over selling from USTs amid the rally in stocks, although JGBs later found reprieve despite mixed 10yr JGB auction results, as the sentiment in Japan deteriorated and following the BoJ announcement for another JPY 500bln unscheduled repo operation.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Ahead of this call, a draft version of the statement appears to make no specific calls for fresh fiscal spending or coordinated rate cuts, however, world leaders will pledge to work together to mitigate the economic fallout from COVID-19. Furthermore, reports ahead of the call at midday were based on a draft version of the text, which could ultimately be revised to provide more of a robust response, should it be deemed to be necessary. In terms of sector specific performance in Europe, gains have been relatively broad-based with all ten key sectors trading markedly higher. Travel names including Deutsche Lufthansa (+9.5%), Air France (+6.5%), and Tui (+5.5%) have been granted some reprieve from recent losses, albeit, it’s difficult to gauge exactly how much the sector would benefit from a response by monetary authorities given that travel restrictions would likely remain in place regardless. Elsewhere, Qiagen (+18.7%) sit at the top of the Stoxx 600 after Thermo Fisher announced a USD 10bln deal to buy the Co, Direct Line (+4.3%) trade higher post-earnings, whilst support has been seen for the Spanish banking sector after a court ruling over mortgage terms could prevent lenders from having to make large compensation payments to customers. To the downside, Hiscox (-4.7%) lag peers over concerns about coronavirus-related claims, a disappointing earnings update for Ashtead (-0.5%) has weighed on Co. shares, whilst Novartis (flat) are marginally softer after the Co.’s subsidiary are to pay USD 195 over antitrust violations.</p><p><strong>Gilead's (GILD)</strong> antiviral drug remdesivir is expected to be used to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus in South Korea as part of a trial, Yonhap citing drug industry sources. (Yonhap)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar is on a firmer footing after extending declines on Monday and the DXY briefly breaching Fib support (97.193) just ahead of 97.000, but crucially from a tech perspective managing to ‘close’ back above. Meanwhile, the Greenback has also gleaned some traction from a rebound in US Treasury yields amidst a strong recovery in equities and risk assets in general on the premise that more global monetary authorities are providing ammunition to combat COVID-19, with additional supportive policies in the pipeline. On that note, G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bankers are holding a conference call around 12GMT to discuss whether the situation warrants coordinated action, which has helped the index return to the 97.500 axis.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD - </strong>Somewhat perversely perhaps, the Pound and Aussie are among the major outperformers even though BoE Governor Carney and MPC members Tenreyro are hinting at some form of policy stimulus at the post-Budget meeting pending what new UK Chancellor Sunak has in store on March 11. Cable is back above 1.2800, albeit with the aid of an encouraging construction PMI as the headline reclaimed 50+ status, while Eur/Gbp has retreated through 0.8700 after running into resistance fractions shy of the 200 DMA and with contacts noted decent model/program offers on the way back down. Back down under, Aud/Usd has been volatile following the RBA’s 25 bp ease overnight and forward guidance suggesting the official cash rate may be held at the new 0.5% record low until the extent of the nCoV (and bushfire) damage is known rather than reduced again to the lower bound that in theory would only leave QE in reserve for any further economic downturn.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK - </strong>The other strong G10 units as the Yen holds above 108.00 vs the Buck following a second test of support circa 108.50 that is now forming a double chart formation, while the Scandi Crowns are rebounding firmly from yesterday’s lows against the Euro on the back of renewed risk appetite that has filtered through to oil and other commodities. Eur/Sek has reversed sharply within 10.6475-5535 parameters and likewise Eur/Nok between 10.3870-3165.</p><p><strong>NZD/CHF/EUR/CAD - </strong>The Kiwi continues to lag its Antipodean counterpart, with Nzd/Usd straddling 0.6250 ahead of the latest GDT auction and awaiting the RBNZ’s response to the coronavirus, while the Franc has handed back some gains vs the Dollar on the 0.9500 handle in contrast to Eur/Chf pivoting 1.0650 in wake of firmer than forecast Swiss GDP. Moreover, the Euro has lost momentum more broadly as Eur/Usd fades around 1.1155 and some distance from Monday’s best levels nearer 1.1185 irrespective of more reports about targeted ECB liquidity and push-backs against near term of knee-jerk rate cuts and QE, via Holzmann this time. Similarly, the Loonie has waned on the approach to 1.3300 and Wednesday’s BoC policy convene that could see a less confident assessment and statement if not action to counter the effects of China’s epidemic.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>It’s back to broad depreciation against the Usd, but with the Zar also hit extremely hard by the SA plunging into a deep recession via a 1.2% q/q Q4 GDP contraction, while the Try continues to lament heightened military conflict in Syria’s Idlb.</p><p><strong>RBA cut rates by 25bps to 0.50% as money markets had fully priced in,</strong> while it stated the board took the decision in response to coronavirus outbreak and will ease policy if needed to support sustainable growth. RBA added that the coronavirus has clouded the near-term outlook for the global economy and GDP in the March quarter is likely to be noticeably weaker than earlier anticipated, although it noted it is too early to tell how persistent the effects of coronavirus will be and that the Australian economy is expected to return to an improving trend once coronavirus is contained. (Newswires)</p><p>Australian PM Morrison said 21 out of 34 coronavirus patients have recovered and that targeted fiscal measures will be needed after the outbreak, while he suggested they are highly aligned with the RBA on challenges due to coronavirus and expects the Big 4 banks to fully pass on a reduction in the RBA’s Cash Rate Target. (Newswires)</p><p>Australian Building Approvals (Jan) -15.3% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. -0.2%, Rev. 3.9%). (Newswires) Australian Building Approvals (Jan) Y/Y -11.3% vs. Exp. 2.4% (Prev. 2.7%) Australian Current Account Balance (AUD)(Q4) 1.0bln vs. Exp. 2.3bln (Prev. 7.9bln, Rev. 6.5bln) Australian Net Exports Contribution (Q4) 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.2%)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds </strong>continue to lead the broad reversal in mainstream bonds with the added weight of a healthy bounce in <strong>Italian BTPs</strong> that is permeating through the Eurozone periphery. The 10-year German debt future has now tested sub-177.00 support at 176.83, albeit in a relatively orderly manner and lock-step with EU stocks and risk sentiment overall.<strong> Gilts</strong> found support a fraction above 135.00 and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are holding at the upper end of overnight session extremes awaiting the G7 at high noon with diminishing expectations and potentially more policy insight from Fed speakers due later.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent front month futures</strong> are bolstered this morning in-line with the generally firmer risk-sentiment, as markets anticipate some form of stimulus package from central banks and with the G7 meeting today at mid-day London time to discuss the situation. In terms of where we currently stand, WTI and Brent are posting gains of around USD 1.50/bbl at present and remain in proximity to their session highs in the mid USD 48/bbl and USD 53/bbl realm. Crude specific, has seen remarks from the Kremlin that we should wait for the OPEC+ meeting for details on whether Russian is ready for additional output cuts. Additionally, Lukoil’s VP expects OPEC to cut production in excess of 1mln BPD; believes that a cut of 600k-1mln would be sufficient to bring prices above the USD 60/bbl mark. Recall the JTC recommended a cut of 600k and Russian Energy Minister Novak has remarked that they have received no communication from Saudi on a 1mln BPD move; are reviewing the 600k recommendation ahead of this week’s Thursday/Friday meeting. Turning to metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> has remained within a comparatively tight range of around USD 15/oz for much of the session, the yellow metals upside has, thus far, been effectively capped by the USD 1600/oz handle. Focus for the safe haven does remain affixed to the coronavirus, and the potential for a policy response to tackle this, as well as other geopolitical concerns such as the ongoing Syrian conflict; in which the Turkish Military confirm that a Syrian Government warplane was shot down as well as reports of ballistic missiles being fired in the region.</p><p>Lukoil VP says that coronavirus impact on global markets will be short-lived and the OPEC+ meeting will help balance oil markets. OPEC+ cut of 600k-1mln bpd would be enough to push prices back to USD 60/bbl but they will lower production as much as they are requested to do so. (Newswires)</p><p>Russia's Kremlin, when asked if Russia is ready for additional output cuts, says we should wait for the OPEC+ meeting later in the week.

Ahead of this call, a draft version of the statement appears to make no specific calls for fresh fiscal spending or coordinated rate cuts, however, world leaders will pledge to work together to mitigate the economic fallout from COVID-19. Furthermore, reports ahead of the call at midday were based on a draft version of the text, which could ultimately be revised to provide more of a robust response, should it be deemed to be necessary. In terms of sector specific performance in Europe, gains have been relatively broad-based with all ten key sectors trading markedly higher. Travel names including Deutsche Lufthansa (+9.5%), Air France (+6.5%), and Tui (+5.5%) have been granted some reprieve from recent losses, albeit, it’s difficult to gauge exactly how much the sector would benefit from a response by monetary authorities given that travel restrictions would likely remain in place regardless. Elsewhere, Qiagen (+18.7%) sit at the top of the Stoxx 600 after Thermo Fisher announced a USD 10bln deal to buy the Co, Direct Line (+4.3%) trade higher post-earnings, whilst support has been seen for the Spanish banking sector after a court ruling over mortgage terms could prevent lenders from having to make large compensation payments to customers. To the downside, Hiscox (-4.7%) lag peers over concerns about coronavirus-related claims, a disappointing earnings update for Ashtead (-0.5%) has weighed on Co. shares, whilst Novartis (flat) are marginally softer after the Co.’s subsidiary are to pay USD 195 over antitrust violations.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar is on a firmer footing after extending declines on Monday and the&nbsp;DXY&nbsp;briefly breaching Fib support (97.193) just ahead of 97.000, but crucially from a tech perspective managing to ‘close’ back above. Meanwhile, the Greenback has also gleaned some traction from a rebound in US Treasury yields amidst a strong recovery in equities and risk assets in general on the premise that more global monetary authorities are providing ammunition to combat COVID-19, with additional supportive policies in the pipeline. On that note, G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bankers are holding a conference call around 12GMT to discuss whether the situation warrants coordinated action, which has helped the index return to the 97.500 axis.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;- Somewhat perversely perhaps, the Pound and Aussie are among the major outperformers even though BoE Governor Carney and MPC members Tenreyro are hinting at some form of policy stimulus at the post-Budget meeting pending what new UK Chancellor Sunak has in store on March 11. Cable is back above 1.2800, albeit with the aid of an encouraging construction PMI as the headline reclaimed 50+ status, while Eur/Gbp has retreated through 0.8700 after running into resistance fractions shy of the 200 DMA and with contacts noted decent model/program offers on the way back down. Back down under, Aud/Usd has been volatile following the RBA’s 25 bp ease overnight and forward guidance suggesting the official cash rate may be held at the new 0.5% record low until the extent of the nCoV (and bushfire) damage is known rather than reduced again to the lower bound that in theory would only leave QE in reserve for any further economic downturn.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong>/<strong>SEK</strong>/<strong>NOK</strong> - The other strong G10 units as the Yen holds above 108.00 vs the Buck following a second test of support circa 108.50 that is now forming a double chart formation, while the Scandi Crowns are rebounding firmly from yesterday’s lows against the Euro on the back of renewed risk appetite that has filtered through to oil and other commodities. Eur/Sek has reversed sharply within 10.6475-5535 parameters and likewise Eur/Nok between 10.3870-3165.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>CHF</strong>/<strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>CAD</strong> - The Kiwi continues to lag its Antipodean counterpart, with Nzd/Usd straddling 0.6250 ahead of the latest GDT auction and awaiting the RBNZ’s response to the coronavirus, while the Franc has handed back some gains vs the Dollar on the 0.9500 handle in contrast to Eur/Chf pivoting 1.0650 in wake of firmer than forecast Swiss GDP. Moreover, the Euro has lost momentum more broadly as Eur/Usd fades around 1.1155 and some distance from Monday’s best levels nearer 1.1185 irrespective of more reports about targeted ECB liquidity and push-backs against near term of knee-jerk rate cuts and QE, via Holzmann this time. Similarly, the Loonie has waned on the approach to 1.3300 and Wednesday’s BoC policy convene that could see a less confident assessment and statement if not action to counter the effects of China’s epidemic.</p><p><strong>EM</strong>&nbsp;- It’s back to broad depreciation against the Usd, but with the Zar also hit extremely hard by the SA plunging into a deep recession via a 1.2% q/q Q4 GDP contraction, while the Try continues to lament heightened military conflict in Syria’s Idlb.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> continue to lead the broad reversal in mainstream bonds with the added weight of a healthy bounce in <strong>Italian BTPs</strong> that is permeating through the Eurozone periphery. The <strong>10-year German</strong> debt future has now tested sub-177.00 support at 176.83, albeit in a relatively orderly manner and lock-step with EU stocks and risk sentiment overall. <strong>Gilts</strong> found support a fraction above 135.00 and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> are holding at the upper end of overnight session extremes awaiting the G7 at high noon with diminishing expectations and potentially more policy insight from Fed speakers due later.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent front month</strong> futures are bolstered this morning in-line with the generally firmer risk-sentiment, as markets anticipate some form of stimulus package from central banks and with the G7 meeting today at mid-day London time to discuss the situation. In terms of where we currently stand, WTI and Brent are posting gains of around USD 1.50/bbl at present and remain in proximity to their session highs in the mid USD 48/bbl and USD 53/bbl realm. Crude specific, has seen remarks from the Kremlin that we should wait for the OPEC+ meeting for details on whether Russian is ready for additional output cuts. Additionally, Lukoil’s VP expects OPEC to cut production in excess of 1mln BPD; believes that a cut of 600k-1mln would be sufficient to bring prices above the USD 60/bbl mark. Recall the JTC recommended a cut of 600k and Russian Energy Minister Novak has remarked that they have received no communication from Saudi on a 1mln BPD move; are reviewing the 600k recommendation ahead of this week’s Thursday/Friday meeting. Turning to metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> has remained within a comparatively tight range of around USD 15/oz for much of the session, the yellow metals upside has, thus far, been effectively capped by the USD 1600/oz handle. Focus for the safe haven does remain affixed to the coronavirus, and the potential for a policy response to tackle this, as well as other geopolitical concerns such as the ongoing Syrian conflict; in which the Turkish Military confirm that a Syrian Government warplane was shot down as well as reports of ballistic missiles being fired in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, bond bulls are not throwing in the towel yet as the core Eurozone bond pares losses alongside US Treasuries awaiting the G7 joint statement from Finance Ministers and Central Bank heads or other prominent officials to see what measures are unveiled or pledged. Indeed, Bunds have bounced relatively strongly to a fresh 177.72 high vs 177.29 low eyeing the EU cash equity opens to see just how far indices run with the monetary and stimulus baton.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> failed to stay afloat of 108.00 and antipodeans were initially subdued following weak data from Australia although later rebounded despite the RBA lowering rates by 25bps as expected. This triggered an initial dovish knee-jerk reaction which was instantly reversed given that the rate cut had been 100% priced in, while the statement from the central bank didn't suggest a great urgency to immediately cut again and with the central bank optimistic for the economy to return to an improving trend once the outbreak was contained.</p><p><strong>RBA cut rates by 25bps to 0.50% as money markets had fully priced in,</strong> while it stated the board took the decision in response to coronavirus outbreak and will ease policy if needed to support sustainable growth.

Desks had also observed the interesting dynamic that Treasuries still caught a hefty bid despite risk-bouncing back after monetary and fiscal policymakers tried to assure markets with talk of support. A big part of that might be a result of dovish central bank pricing, with the implied probability of rate cuts getting boosted among major central banks. In fact, pricing was a source of interest, given that the market is nearly priced for nearly three rate cuts by the Fed's meeting on 18th March, while pricing through the end of the year now has four rate cuts pencilled in. Whether the Fed can deliver on those expectations remains to be seen, although a key focus will be Tuesday's term repo operations (which have seen oversubscriptions in recent offerings) given that the cost of borrowing overnight rose to 1.80% on Monday (above the top-end of the federal funds rate target range between 1.50-1.75%) from 1.65% on Friday. Some speculate that the Fed could tweak its offerings as an immediate way of stemming the tightening in financial conditions.

        "content": "<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia are to decide on rates on Tuesday in which the central bank is expected to cut the Cash Rate Target with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures indicating a 100% expectation for rates to be lowered by 25bps to a new record low of 0.50%. This is in sharp contrast to only 3 days ago when market pricing was just for an 18% chance of a cut and its respective implied yield curve had suggested May as the earliest for when the central bank would loosen policy.</p><p>The dramatic shift in expectations follows abysmal factory activity for Australia’s largest trading partner China, which slumped to below GFC-levels with Chinese Manufacturing PMI and Caixin Manufacturing PMI at their lowest on record of 35.7 vs. Exp. 46.0 (Prev. 50.0) and 40.3 vs. Exp. 45.7 (Prev. 51.1) respectively. This has spurred calls for policy makers to conduct decisive measures to address the ongoing fallout from the coronavirus outbreak with some even suggesting a potential risk of a deeper cut of 50bps. Furthermore, notorious RBA watcher McCrann, who was among the early advocates for a rate cut for this meeting even prior to the alarming Chinese PMIs, suggested that both fiscal &amp; monetary policy cupboards are bare and that with interest rates already near zero, we will now all-but certainly get a rate cut from the RBA if not also “other” action.</p><p>The recent domestic releases have also been disappointing including jobs data which despite showing higher Employment Change of 13.5k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 28.9k) due to a 46.2k increase in Full-Time jobs, also coincided with a rise in the Unemployment Rate to 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.2% (Prev. 5.1%). In addition, Capital Expenditure (Q4) -2.8% vs. Exp. 0.4%, Construction Work Done (Q4) -3.0% vs. Exp. -1.0% and Retail Sales (Dec) -0.5% vs. Exp. -0.2% have all missed estimates.</p><p>Conversely, the rhetoric from the RBA had suggested the central bank was prepared to ease if needed although were unlikely to do just yet as it reiterated in the last meeting that it will ease policy if needed to support sustainable growth and that rates are to remain low for an extended period. Governor Lowe also stated that they discussed the case for lower rates extensively and will keep assessing the balance of judgement between a rate cut and keeping it on hold, although he doesn't think a lower rate would enhance the medium-term benefits of the economy and noted it is not practical at the moment to get inflation back to 2.5% by next year using monetary policy. Furthermore, the central bank maintained the view that the economy is still passing through a gentle turning point and acknowledged lower interest rates could encourage more borrowing which could increase risk of problems in the future. These comments would therefore suggest the central bank was hesitant to act and a hold in rates would have been the foregone conclusion if it were not for the shocking Chinese PMIs.</p><p>The announcement is scheduled for 0330GMT/2130CST/ 1130HKT and aside from the rate decision, focus will be on the statement for clues on future policy and if the RBA hints of more aggressive measures which would likely pressure AUD/USD , while a lack thereof could result in an unwinding of dovish bets and underpin the currency. In addition, the central bank may also brush upon the Australian bushfires, albeit to a lesser extent as they are now said to have now been contained at the worst hit state.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls</p><ul><li>Former RBA board member Edwards anticipates the RBA will likely keep rates on hold.</li><li>JPMorgan sees the RBA cutting rates by 50bps at this month’s meeting.</li><li>NAB said it expects the RBA to cut at this meeting and again in April, while it sees a risk of a 50bps cut at the looming announcement in an aggressive response to the coronavirus.</li><li>Westpac brought forward its RBA rate cut forecast and now sees a 25bps cut at this meeting followed by another 25bps cut in April.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Asia trades mostly higher as the region takes impetus from the rally on Wall St amid hopes of a coordinated policy response to the fallout from the coronavirus, with G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bankers planning a call to weigh the coronavirus response which will be led by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Fed Chair Powell, while FFR futures were now pointing to a 75bps cut by the Fed this month. This inspired a surge across the major US indices led by the DJIA which rose over 5% which was the most in over a decade and posted its biggest point gain on record of nearly 1300 points. ASX 200 (+1.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were lifted at the open with Tech and Healthcare frontrunning the broad sector gains in Australia and with markets also anticipating a rate cut by the RBA later today, while the Japanese benchmark was less decisive and briefly retraced all its gains amid detrimental flows into the currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) are positive with the latter breaching the psychological 3000 level as sentiment is supported by the global stimulus hopes and a continued decline in the pace of coronavirus cases in mainland China.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY nurses recent losses to just about reclaim the 97.50 level although the rebound is relatively mild in comparison to the recent losses amid further expectations of a more aggressive response by the FOMC as reflected by Fed Fund Rate futures which price in around 85% probability for a 75bps cut by the Fed this month, while participants also look ahead to Super Tuesday with Buttigieg, Klobuchar and O’Rourke all in endorsement of former VP Biden. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are uneventful with the single currency holding on to recent gains at the 1.1100 handle which had been at the expense of the greenback, while GBP/USD languishes at a sub-1.2800 level with the UK and EU now in official trade negotiations surrounded by plenty of pessimism, not helped by UK threats to walk away. Elsewhere, USD/JPY pulled back although has just about found a floor around 108.00 and antipodeans are subdued following weak data from Australia heading into the RBA rate decision where OIS price in 100% expectations for a 25bps rate cut, while there were also comments from PM Morrison who suggested that targeted fiscal measures will be needed after the outbreak and that he expects the Big 4 banks to fully pass on an interest rate cut should the RBA lower the Cash Rate Target.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs slumped to below the 153.50 level on spillover selling from USTs amid the rally in stocks and with demand also sapped ahead of a 10yr JGB auction despite the BoJ announcing another JPY 500bln unscheduled repo operation.</p>",
