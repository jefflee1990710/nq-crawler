There was more optimism on this front given that the two US counterparts were ahead of schedule, with some interpreting this as a sign that the US side wants this round of talks to succeed. In related comments, US President Trump highlighted that he wants to make a deal with China and that he has a big team working on an agreement though stating he would either accept a deal or tariffs on China. He went on to say that he has no plans to meet Chinese President Xi in March, but does expect a meeting with him at some point to close the pact. He said however that he would consider extending the March 1 deadline, if a deal is close, with reports in the FT adding that he would do so without raising tariffs. In regard to the deadline, editor-in-chief of the Global Times said the are several possibilities but believes &ldquo;it is the least likely scenario that the two sides announce the negotiations fail and the trade war escalates&quot;. Elsewhere, reports in Politico suggested that China hawks are concerned Trump may accept a weak agreement with China to avoid upsetting markets, that &ldquo;may not include significant concessions on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer or any real enforcement mechanism&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>A White House official on Tuesday said that US President Trump had not made a decision on the proposed &quot;in principle deal&quot; to avert another US government shutdown before Friday&#39;s deadline; the official said Trump wants to review the language, and any deal will require the President&#39;s support. Details have been thin, however, it was reported that the plan includes $1.4bln for Trump&#39;s border security initiatives, short of the $5.7bln Trump had demanded. Democrats were also said to drop their own demand for capping the number of people that ICE can detain. In later comments, Republican Senate Majority Leader McConnell said he hopes Trump signs a border funding agreement while &nbsp;Republican Senator Shelby believes the GOP will support the deal, says deal is a &quot;down payment&quot; on Trump&#39;s border requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May addressed parliament today where she said she told the EU parliament the need for legally binding changes to the Irish backstop and that, following talks with EU leaders, she will bring an amendable motion on Thursday. However, May promised to give parliament non-binding votes on the next steps if she has not attained a new deal by February 26th. Some members of parliament are looking to take control of the process earlier via tabling motions on Thursday; Labour MP Cooper has already published a bill to force a Brexit delay if there is no deal by March 13, PM May is opposed to this where she says it will not solve anything and does not honour the British public. The opposition claim May is delaying the final vote on the deal so that MPs feel blackmailed to back her deal so that a no-deal is avoided. On the EU front, Irish PM Varadkar said he could not accept the UK&rsquo;s demands and EU&rsquo;s Verhofstadt said he has heard no solutions to the deadlock despite meeting with top UK officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed Chair Powell was upbeat on the US economy stating that the US is growing at &ldquo;solid pace&rdquo;; he highlighted that employment is close to maximum at a national level; labour force participation is a high priority. He also does not feel a probability of a recession is at all elevated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.69 HIGHER AT USD 53.10/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.91 HIGHER AT USD 62.42/BBL. </strong>Oil prices pushed higher throughout Tuesday, with a mixture of tailwinds such as production cuts and US/China trade optimism. Saudi Arabia Energy Minster Al-Falih announced that it will reduce its oil production to approximately 9.8mln BPD in March, below the pre-stated OPEC+ supply cut target by 500k. Russia also clarified some cuts where Energy Minister Novak said Russia&#39;s February oil output will decrease by 90k-100k BPD vs. October&#39;s level (January decreased by 47k vs. October). Trade sentiment improved today too as US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer arrived in China ahead of schedule for trade talks, bringing optimism of added future global oil demand. On the flipside, the EIA cut its 2019 and 2020 world oil demand forecast by 50k BPD to 1.49mln BPD in 2019, and 1.48mln BPD in 2020, as well as forecasting US crude output in 2019 rising by 1.45mln BPD to 12.41mln BPD (Prev. 1.14mln); 2020 US crude output seen surpassing 13mln BPD for the first time. Looking ahead at API inventory estimates where crude is seen building 2.7mln barrels, Cushing is seen building 31k barrels, distillates are seen drawing 1.1mln barrels and gasoline is seen building 0.8mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.28% at 2745, NASDAQ +1.53% at 7015, DJI +1.48% at 25425. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +1.18%, Materials +2.23%, Industrials +1.55%, Cons Discretionary +1.65%, Cons Staples +0.87%, Healthcare +1.34%, Financials +1.54%, Tech +1.36%, Telecoms +1.13%, Utilities +0.17%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Electronic Arts (EA) surging on the open for a second day in the row following it reporting 25mln week one players of its new Apex Legends game. Gilead Sciences (GILD) opening lower after a cirrhosis treating drug failed to meet a Phase 3 trial endpoint. Molson Coors (TAP) nosedived following its earnings where it announced restatements from 2016/2017 due to &ldquo;material weakness&rdquo;. IPG Photonics (IPGP) opened higher after reporting a beat on revenue, despite a miss on EPS and lower guidance. Coty (COTY) soared after private equity firm JAB made a tender offer to increase its stake in the personal products co. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) tanked after investors were unimpressed by results from one of its cancer treatments. Elli Mae (ELLI) outperformed on the announcement of buyout firm Thoma Bravo acquiring it. Cisco (CSCO) and Take-Two (TTWO) underperformed following downgrades at Morgan Stanley and BMO Capital respectively. Looking ahead, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) report earnings after the bell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 121-30+.</strong> Treasuries followed risk sentiment on Thursday and drifted lower on Tuesday amid strong demand for equities fuelled by US and China optimism as well as hopes that another government shutdown can be avoided. The yield curve bear-steepened slightly with most of the action concentrated in the belly and long end of the curve where yields were higher by c.2bps at settlement. Altria (MO) raised USD 11.5bln in seven parts to finance its stake in Juul Labs. Spreads mostly widened with the exception of 10s30s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> Not quite all change, but the tables have turned somewhat for many Dollar/major pairings as some of the early Greenback euphoria wanes and rival currencies attempt to pare losses. The index has ducked under 97.000 again having carved out new 3 week highs just over 97.200 before reports that US President Trump is holding back from signing off on the proposed deal to avoid another Government shutdown until he sees further details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CHF, NZD:</strong> The Aussie and Franc are flanking the G10 ranks as the former derives most from positive noises surrounding US-China trade talks, another upturn in broad risk appetite plus an improvement in NAB business sentiment and conditions that more than offset a significantly steeper decline in housing finance vs consensus. Aud/Usd has bounced further from circa 0.7050 lows towards 0.7100, while Aud/Nzd is consolidating recovery gains above 1.0500, as the Kiwi treads more cautiously vs its US counterpart between 0.6745-20 ahead of the overnight RBNZ policy meeting. On that note, options are pricing a 60 pip break-even on that event and we have a full preview available via the Ransquawk Research Suite that will be flagged on the headline feed closer to the new 01.00GMT rate announcement and accompanying statement). Elsewhere, the Chf is lagging and virtually back to lows hit on Monday night when stops and program buy orders were triggered in thin Japanese holiday trade, close to 1.1000 vs the Buck and near 1.1400 against the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, GBP, EUR, JPY: </strong>The Loonie has extended gains vs the Buck to test 1.3250 resistance with the aid of a more pronounced bounce in oil, while the Pound, single currency and Jpy have all benefited from a mixture of short covering and a broader Usd pull-back. Cable breached recent lows ahead of the latest Commons update from UK PM May on Brexit &lsquo;progress&rsquo; that revealed nothing new, but gradually regrouped after a speech by BoE Governor Carney underscored the base case for gradual and limited tightening to ensure inflation meets target, albeit acknowledging greater risks of a no deal that could be &lsquo;quite bad&rsquo;. However, Cable topped out just ahead of 1.2900 and has not cleared the 100 DMA at 1.2889 vs 1.2834 at one stage, in similar vein to Eur/Usd that has faded after a brief pop above 1.1300 against its fresh 1.1258 base for the year so far. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has slipped back towards 110.50 from a new 2019 peak of 110.65 after failing to extend the upside towards heavy offers seen at 111.00 (from Japanese exporters and in defence of a barrier). Chart-wise, 110.54-59 may be pivotal on a closing basis as this incorporates a Fib and the 55 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK:</strong> Bid for the most part amidst the aforementioned ongoing revival in risk sentiment, but also on short covering, and less bearish chart impulses. Eur/Nok has retreated further fuelled by crude&rsquo;s resurgence to sub-9.8000 territory and overtaken Eur/Sek in the process, as the latter holds just below 10.5000, awaiting independent impetus from the Riksbank on Wednesday &ndash; again see our Research Suite for a detailed preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RBNZ:</strong> RBNZ expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.75%.

Saudi Arabia Energy Minster Al-Falih announced Tuesday that it will reduce its oil production to approximately 9.8mln BPD in March, below the pre-stated OPEC+ supply cut target by 500k. Russia also clarified some cuts where Energy Minister Novak said Russia&#39;s February oil output will decrease by 90k-100k BPD vs. October&#39;s level (January decreased by 47k vs. October). Trade sentiment improved today too as US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer arrived in China ahead of schedule for trade talks, bringing optimism of added future global oil demand. On the flipside, the EIA cut its 2019 and 2020 world oil demand forecast by 50k BPD to 1.49mln BPD in 2019, and 1.48mln BPD in 2020, as well as forecasting US crude output in 2019 rising by 1.45mln BPD to 12.41mln BPD (Prev. 1.14mln); 2020 US crude output seen surpassing 13mln BPD for the first time. Looking ahead at API inventory estimates where crude is seen building 2.7mln barrels, Cushing is seen building 31k barrels, distillates are seen drawing 1.1mln barrels and gasoline is seen building 0.8mln.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not quite all change, but the tables have turned somewhat for many Dollar/major pairings as some of the early Greenback euphoria wanes and rival currencies attempt to pare losses. The index has ducked under 97.000 again having carved out new 3 week highs just over 97.200 before reports that US President Trump is holding back from signing off on the proposed deal to avoid another Government shutdown until he sees further details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CHF/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aussie and Franc are flanking the G10 ranks as the former derives most from positive noises surrounding US-China trade talks, another upturn in broad risk appetite plus an improvement in NAB business sentiment and conditions that more than offset a significantly steeper decline in housing finance vs consensus. Aud/Usd has bounced further from circa 0.7050 lows towards 0.7100, while Aud/Nzd is consolidating recovery gains above 1.0500, as the Kiwi treads more cautiously vs its US counterpart between 0.6745-20 ahead of the overnight RBNZ policy meeting. On that note, options are pricing a 60 pip break-even on that event and we have a full preview available via the Ransquawk Research Suite that will be flagged on the headline feed closer to the new 01.00GMT rate announcement and accompanying statement). Elsewhere, the Chf is lagging and virtually back to lows hit on Monday night when stops and program buy orders were triggered in thin Japanese holiday trade, close to 1.1000 vs the Buck and near 1.1400 against the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has extended gains vs the Buck to test 1.3250 resistance with the aid of a more pronounced bounce in oil, while the Pound, single currency and Jpy have all benefited from a mixture of short covering and a broader Usd pull-back. Cable breached recent lows ahead of the latest Commons update from UK PM May on Brexit &lsquo;progress&rsquo; that revealed nothing new, but gradually regrouped after a speech by BoE Governor Carney underscored the base case for gradual and limited tightening to ensure inflation meets target, albeit acknowledging greater risks of a no deal that could be &lsquo;quite bad&rsquo;. However, Cable topped out just ahead of 1.2900 and has not cleared the 100 DMA at 1.2889 vs 1.2834 at one stage, in similar vein to Eur/Usd that has faded after a brief pop above 1.1300 against its fresh 1.1258 base for the year so far. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has slipped back towards 110.50 from a new 2019 peak of 110.65 after failing to extend the upside towards heavy offers seen at 111.00 (from Japanese exporters and in defence of a barrier). Chart-wise, 110.54-59 may be pivotal on a closing basis as this incorporates a Fib and the 55 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bid for the most part amidst the aforementioned ongoing revival in risk sentiment, but also on short covering, and less bearish chart impulses. Eur/Nok has retreated further fuelled by crude&rsquo;s resurgence to sub-9.8000 territory and overtaken Eur/Sek in the process, as the latter holds just below 10.5000, awaiting independent impetus from the Riksbank on Wednesday &ndash; again see our Research Suite for a detailed preview.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) and Hang Seng (Unch.) were kept afloat but with upside limited by indecision as participants await the outcome of trade discussions and after the PBoC refrained from open market operations which resulted to a daily net drain of CNY 100bln.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All major European indices are in the green [Euro Stoxx 50 +1.0%], continuing from the optimism seen in Asia overnight on US-China trade and the potential for averting a US government shutdown. Sectors are also all in the green, with some slight outperformance in material names. The Dax (+1.2%) is marginally outperforming its peers, in spite of being weighed upon by index heavyweight Thyssenkrupp (-1.9%) who are down following earnings where the Co. confirmed their outlook, but stated that economic and political uncertainties are increasing. Other notable movers include, Michelin (+11.6%) who are at the top of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings, with Continental (+4.1%) higher in sympathy. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Tui (-3.1%) following their earnings. Separately, Kering (+2.4%) were in the red following their earnings, in spite of Gucci&rsquo;s operating margin reaching a record 39.5% by end of 2018; although Co. shares have now drifted higher into positive territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Greenback remains bid in wake of reports that a deal has been struck in principle to avoid another US Government shutdown ahead of Friday&rsquo;s funding deadline, while the US trade envoy has arrived in Beijing amidst heightened prospects of forging an agreement in time for the next tranche of import tariffs due on March 1st. The index just off a marginal new multi-week peak of 97.209, with the Dollar extending gains vs most G10 rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - Another broad upturn in risk appetite has hit the safe havens hardest, understandably, with the Franc slipping closer towards yesterday&rsquo;s overnight flash crash lows at 1.0091 vs 1.0095, and Usd/Jpy climbing to fresh 2019 highs circa 110.65 having breached 110.50 and the peak from 31st December last year just a pip or so below. Rebounding US Treasury yields are also impacting, and with no Japanese exporter supply anticipated before 111.00 where barrier defence offers are also expected, technical impulses could be more influential in the short term given a key Fib level and the 55 DMA in close proximity (110.54 and 110.59 respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP/EUR - Also conceding further ground to the Usd, with the Kiwi retesting support around the 100 DMA (0.6725) ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting that is widely forecast to culminate in a dovish hold (see our headline feed and/or research suite for a full preview of the event. Meanwhile, the Pound remains blighted by Brexit risk and related economic repercussions, as Cable teeters just above 1.2800 and a slightly deeper post-UK data low around 1.2834, with bids seen at 1.2820 and the 55 DMA at 1.2810. The single currency is consolidating off a fresh ytd base of 1.1258, but looking more prone to heavier losses while under 1.1300 and given little in the way of chart support ahead of the 2018 low (1.1216) apart from 1.1234.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD - Defying the overall trend and both firmer vs their US counterpart, the Aud has rebounded firmly above 0.7050 and 1.0500 vs the Nzd with the aid of a more encouraging NAB business survey vs much weaker than forecast housing loans data. Meanwhile, the Loonie has drawn support from a rebound in crude prices and pared losses from 1.3300+ to circa 1.3270.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - The technical landscape appears to be turning less negative for the Scandi crowns after recent underperformance, and some market participants are pointing to oversold conditions that may be combining with simple short covering/positioning for tomorrow&rsquo;s Riksbank meeting. Accordingly, Eur/Sek has retreated a bit further below the psychological 10.5000 mark, while Eur/Nok is following suit, albeit more gradually to sit near 9.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some respite for regional currencies against the backdrop of improved risk sentiment, and with the Rand also relieved to hear that Eskom is hoping to end power cuts by the end of the week &ndash; Usd/Zar back down below 13.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK 10yr debt futures are still being drawn to the 124.00 level having recovered from session troughs of 123.84 as UK traders await scheduled comments from UK PM May who is set to plead for tenacity ahead of the Valentine&#39;s Day vote on the Brexit deal (unless it is delayed to allow MPs to focus on matters of the heart). Some further direction may also be found from BoE&rsquo;s Carney who is set to speak half hour after the PM&#39;s address at 13:00GMT. In Germany, 10-year futures have regained the 166.00 handle as the benchmark failed to breach the technical support figure of 165.87 convincingly and saw little inspiration, or demotivation, from ECB commentary via Nowotny and Weidmann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are lower across the curve with most of the action in the longer end as US participants continue to unwind risk premia following suggestions that a deal on the border has been reached. Traders will now be looking forward to comments from Fed&rsquo;s Powell in the middle of the US morning, alongside any indications from Beijing after sources reported that the USTR has touched ground in the city ahead of the scheduled trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.7%) and WTI (+1.5%) prices are comfortably in the green and above USD 62/bbl and USD 53/bbl respectively after Saudi Arabia posited that crude production in March is set to be 500k below their OPEC+ cut target at 9.8mln BPD. Support has also been offered by the optimistic risk tone after positive comments pertaining to US-China trade and a deal to prevent the US Government from shutting down again; as USTR Lighthizer arrived in Beijing this morning. OPEC are to publish their monthly oil market report today, where 2019 world oil demand was forecast to grow at 1.29mln BPD. In addition, the EIA are to release their Short-Term Energy Outlook; which previously forecast US oil output to average 12.1mln BBL and 12.9mln BBL in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.4%) has strengthened somewhat this morning, breaking from the subdued price action seen overnight as the dollar remained firm; the yellow metal is now trading towards the top of its USD 10/oz range. Elsewhere, reports indicate that Vale knew the Brazil dam which collapsed last month was more than twice as likely to fail than the maximum allowed risk level from internal guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuela Oil Minister says oil exports stand at 1.2-1.3mln BPD. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraqi Oil Ministers states that production capacity at the nation&#39;s South Refineries Co. will hit 280k bpd by the end of 2019.(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Kremlin states that there are currently no substantial discussions between Russia and OPEC to form a new alliance. According to a spokesman Russian President Putin sees the OPEC+ deal as contributing to oil market stabilisation.

Sectors are also all in the green, with some slight outperformance in material names. The Dax (+1.2%) is marginally outperforming its peers, in spite of being weighed upon by index heavyweight Thyssenkrupp (-1.9%) who are down following earnings where the Co. confirmed their outlook, but stated that economic and political uncertainties are increasing. Other notable movers include, Michelin (+11.6%) who are at the top of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings, with Continental (+4.1%) higher in sympathy. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Tui (-3.1%) following their earnings. Separately, Kering (+2.4%) were in the red following their earnings, in spite of Gucci&rsquo;s operating margin reaching a record 39.5% by end of 2018; although Co. shares have now drifted higher into positive territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD The Greenback remains bid in wake of reports that a deal has been struck in principle to avoid another US Government shutdown ahead of Friday&rsquo;s funding deadline, while the US trade envoy has arrived in Beijing amidst heightened prospects of forging an agreement in time for the next tranche of import tariffs due on March 1st. The index just off a marginal new multi-week peak of 97.209, with the Dollar extending gains vs most G10 rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY Another broad upturn in risk appetite has hit the safe havens hardest, understandably, with the Franc slipping closer towards yesterday&rsquo;s overnight flash crash lows at 1.0075 vs 1.0095, and Usd/Jpy climbing to fresh 2019 highs circa 110.65 having breached 110.50 and the peak from 31st December last year just a pip or so below. Rebounding US Treasury yields are also impacting, and with no Japanese exporter supply anticipated before 111.00 where barrier defence offers are also expected, technical impulses could be more influential in the short term given a key Fib level and the 55 DMA in close proximity (110.54 and 110.59 respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP/EUR Also conceding further ground to the Usd, with the Kiwi retesting support around the 100 DMA (0.6725) ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting that is widely forecast to culminate in a dovish hold (see our headline feed and/or research suite for a full preview of the event. Meanwhile, the Pound remains blighted by Brexit risk and related economic repercussions, as Cable teeters just above 1.2800 and a slightly deeper post-UK data low around 1.2834, with bids seen at 1.2820 and the 55 DMA at 1.2810. The single currency is consolidating off a fresh ytd base of 1.1258, but looking more prone to heavier losses while under 1.1300 and given little in the way of chart support ahead of the 2018 low (1.1216) apart from 1.1234.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD Defying the overall trend and both firmer vs their US counterpart, the Aud has rebounded firmly above 0.7050 and 1.0500 vs the Nzd with the aid of a more encouraging NAB business survey vs much weaker than forecast housing loans data. Meanwhile, the Loonie has drawn support from a rebound in crude prices and pared losses from 1.3300+ to circa 1.3270.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK The technical landscape appears to be turning less negative for the Scandi crowns after recent underperformance, and some market participants are pointing to oversold conditions that may be combining with simple short covering/positioning for tomorrow&rsquo;s Riksbank meeting. Accordingly, Eur/Sek has retreated a bit further below the psychological 10.5000 mark, while Eur/Nok is following suit, albeit more gradually to sit near 9.8000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM Some respite for regional currencies against the backdrop of improved risk sentiment, and with the Rand also relieved to hear that Eskom is hoping to end power cuts by the end of the week &ndash; Usd/Zar back down below 13.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK 10yr debt futures are still being drawn to the 124.00 level having recovered from session troughs of 123.84 as UK traders await scheduled comments from UK PM May who is set to plead for tenacity ahead of the Valentine&#39;s Day vote on the Brexit deal (unless it is delayed to allow MPs to focus on matters of the heart). Some further direction may also be found from BoE&rsquo;s Carney who is set to speak half hour after the PM&#39;s address at 13:00GMT. In Germany, 10-year futures have regained the 166.00 handle as the benchmark failed to breach the technical support figure of 165.87 convincingly and saw little inspiration, or demotivation, from ECB commentary via Nowotny and Weidmann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UST futures are lower across the curve with most of the action in the longer end as US participants continue to unwind risk premia following suggestions that a deal on the border has been reached. Traders will now be looking forward to comments from Fed&rsquo;s Powell in the middle of the US morning, alongside any indications from Beijing after sources reported that the USTR has touched ground in the city ahead of the scheduled trade talks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.7%) and WTI (+1.5%) prices are comfortably in the green and above USD 62/bbl and USD 53/bbl respectively after Saudi Arabia posited that crude production in March is set to be 500k below their OPEC+ cut target at 9.8mln BPD. Support has also been offered by the optimistic risk tone after positive comments pertaining to US-China trade and a deal to prevent the US Government from shutting down again; as USTR Lighthizer arrived in Beijing this morning. OPEC are to publish their monthly oil market report today, where 2019 world oil demand was forecast to grow at 1.29mln BPD. In addition, the EIA are to release their Short-Term Energy Outlook; which previously forecast US oil output to average 12.1mln BBL and 12.9mln BBL in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.4%) has strengthened somewhat this morning, breaking from the subdued price action seen overnight as the dollar remained firm; the yellow metal is now trading towards the top of its USD 10/oz range. Elsewhere, reports indicate that Vale knew the Brazil dam which collapsed last month was more than twice as likely to fail than the maximum allowed risk level from internal guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Accordingly, Eur/Sek has retreated a bit further below the psychological 10.5000 mark, while Eur/Nok is following suit, albeit more gradually to sit near 9.8000. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for regional currencies against the backdrop of improved risk sentiment, and with the Rand also relieved to hear that Eskom is hoping to end power cuts by the end of the week &ndash; Usd/Zar back down below 13.8000.</p>\r\n",

Back to Brexit, PM May will deliver an update on the latest state of play to the House of Commons at 12.30GMT, while a speech from BoE Governor Carney 30 minutes later will be scrutinised for any further insight and policy guidance after super Thursday, though in truth he is unlikely to have much more to offer given ongoing uncertainty about the terms that Britain is set to leave the EU on.</p>\r\n",

Some tech studies are now flagging 165.69, but Bunds appear to have found a few underlying bids around 100 ticks below the aforementioned peak (166.83), as the corresponding cash yield encounters offers/resistance ahead of 0.15%, which formed support on the way down before the subsequent decline to sub-0.10% levels. In terms of latest bearish catalysts for core debt, another rebound in global stocks is weighing amidst reports that a provisional deal has been reached to avoid US Government shutting down again, while trade talks between the US and China are said to be progressing well with a potential accord in the offing.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.6%) were positive with outperformance in the Japanese benchmark on return from the extended weekend as exporters were underpinned by favourable currency moves, although Toshiba was the notable laggard after it confirmed reports it could reduce FY profit guidance by half.

(Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May will today urge MPs to &quot;hold our nerve&quot; to get the changes needed to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May would win a working majority if a general election were held today, according to YouGov modelling for The Times. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Cabinet ministers reportedly believe UK PM May is preparing to resign in the summer so she can influence who becomes her successor in an effort to stop Boris Johnson from getting the PM role. (The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK House of Commons leader Leadsom commented that there was no chance UK PM May will accept Labour Party&rsquo;s customs union proposal. (ITV)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier said meetings with UK Brexit Secretary Barclay were &quot;constructive&quot;, while a UK spokesperson said both parties have agreed to more talks to find a breakthrough. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remained firm following the prior day&rsquo;s strength in which the DXY rose above the 97.00 level and posted its best levels YTD, while its counterparts were subdued as EUR/USD struggled to nurse recent losses and with GBP/USD despondent from the recent data-induced decline to below the 1.2900 handle. Elsewhere, antipodeans were mixed as AUD benefited from stronger NAB Business Confidence data and with NZD lacklustre which in turn helped AUD/NZD reclaim the 1.0500 level, while USD/JPY firmed whilst the PBoC also adjusted its reference rate in light of the recent broad USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Housing Finance (Dec) -6.1% vs. Exp. -2.8% (Prev. -0.9%).

Elsewhere, gold traded flat with price action restricted as the greenback remained firm, while copper was also rangebound amid a somewhat tentative tone in China and as the rally in Dalian iron futures stalled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastern Libyan forces are said to have gained full control of El Sharara oilfield.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury futures sold off on Monday as investors await on Wednesday&rsquo;s crucial CPI data for January, where a strong print could tilt a data-dependent Fed to a more hawkish stance. The sell-off was exacerbated going into the US equity open, with positive China-US trade comments from White House Advisor Kelly Conway and a block sale of 8k+ TUH9 by a real money account. Treasuries continued selling off through the session where nine investment grade issuances flooded the market. Looking at the curve on the close, most of the actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps. Spreads were mixed where there was steepening in the front-end with 2s/5s widening by 0.8bps, whilst spreads at the belly to long-end flattened. US T-note futures (H9) settled 8 ticks lower at 122-04.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said we are going to make great deals on trade and don&#39;t want China to have a hard time. President Trump also commented that we probably have some good news regarding border deal but added he didn&rsquo;t know what they meant regarding progress and affirmed the US would build the wall anyway. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senator Shelby said an agreement in principle was reached on shutdown talks and that staff will work on the deal. Senator Shelby also commented that he hopes the White House will back the deal and that the border bill will have some money for a barrier, while US Rep. Lowey said staff could work out the full details of border security deal by Wednesday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US congressional aide said the tentative US border security deal provides USD 1.375bln to build 55 miles of border fence but does not contain any funds for a border wall and does not include Democrats&rsquo; demand for capping number of immigrant detention beds. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury official Malpass who is part of the US delegation in Beijing for deputy level talks, said that March 1st deadline will not be extended. (SCMP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bowman (Voter) said US economy and Fed&#39;s policy are in a good place and that she is comfortable with the current stance of policy, while she also continues to see great job numbers and solid wage growth.

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) are indecisive with participants tentative as they await the outcome of this week&rsquo;s US-China trade discussions and after the PBoC refrained from open market operations which resulted to a daily net drain of CNY 100bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains firm following the prior day&rsquo;s strength in which the DXY rose above the 97.00 level and posted its best levels YTD, while its counterparts are subdued as EUR/USD struggles to nurse recent losses and with GBP/USD despondent from the recent data-induced slide to below the 1.2900 handle.
