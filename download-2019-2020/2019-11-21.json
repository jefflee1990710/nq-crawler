UBS analyst, Timothy Arcuri, downgraded KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT). The analyst downgraded KLAC and AMAT as he sees the Water Fab Equipment (WFE) Run-Rate peaking. LRCX also downgraded on the same reasoning, although the analyst noted it has better relative exposure.

Equity futures were firmer overnight following China Vice Premier Liu He saying he was cautiously optimistic about a deal being reached. Some selling pressure however emerged on vocal Chinese opposition to the Hong Kong bill, but later reports of invitations for the US to come to Beijing for talks by year end, in addition to the December 15th tariffs likely being delayed, helped futures come off their lows until equity bourses were offered somewhat into the close; the situation is clearly fluid. Meanwhile, US data wasn't providing much support for sentiment, existing home sales picked up from the prior but missed expectations and jobless claims disappointed. The new orders component of the Philly Fed index remained grim, although the more backward-looking headline figure did beat expectations. It is worth highlighting that the TPLEX actually sold off through the session, whether it was a more positive interpretation of the trade updates, or a pause on the recent bull-flattening, remains unclear. The higher rates also supported the greenback, which found additional bidders on the potential December 15th tariff delays report; CAD was firmer on hawkish Poloz comments, stepping back from Wilkins dovish comments, whilst ZAR also strengthened as the SARB left rates unchanged. In equity sectors, semiconductors (SOX) were the underperformers after UBS downgraded a handful, energy was boosted by the crude complex's second consecutive day of price gains (seemingly unphased by potential China trade impasses). M dipped after reporting a bad quarter and lowering guidance (again), whilst AMTD surged on sources reporting a SHCW acquisition inbound. Participants now look to Friday where manufacturing PMIs will hit and newly appointed ECB Chief Lagarde will give her first address in the position, meanwhile in the near-term, TSLA will unveil its much-anticipated electric truck with large implied volatility for the event.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>Markets have been hit by a litany of mixed US/China trade updates since the markets close on Wednesday night. Last night, US President Trump said he doesn't think China is “stepping up” to the level he wants in trade talks. Moreover, the US House passed and sent the Hong Kong Human Rights bill to US President Trump for his signature, which sources noted he was expected to give. Overnight Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was more optimistic, saying that he is cautiously optimistic about agreeing a Phase One deal with US. China’s Commerce Ministry also took a more positive tone this morning, saying they will strive to reach a phase-one trade deal with the US and that, regarding possible disagreements in discussions with the US, outside rumours are not accurate and the both teams will maintain communications. Later, a WSJ report alleged that China had invited USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to Beijing for further talks, which the Chinese hoped would conclude before next Thursday, although the US side is reportedly reluctant to travel all the way to China unless they make it clear that they would make commitments on IP protection, forced technology transfers and ag purchases. Also of note, yesterday in hours reports noted that Brazil was President Xi’s final international trip, signalling a domestic signing of the Phase One deal. The story was taken as a positive by the market, although WSJ’s Wei, adding further colour to the story, reported that China is balking at US requests to guarantee ag purchases and for stronger language on IP and tech transfers without a US guarantee on tariff rollback, while the US reportedly doesn't want to agree to move until they get Chinese commitment on these very issues. “Both sides are locked in a game of chicken, and the clock is ticking towards Dec. 15th” she said. With US President Trump likely to sign the Hong Kong Human Rights bill today, the “game of chicken” being played regarding neither side wanting to make further concessions re. ag purchases, IP protection, tech transfers or tariff rollback may now not be the only sticking points in the talks – an SCMP report, citing sources, said that China is watching US President Trump’s response to the Hong Kong Human Rights Bill, and that it threatens to become another obstacle to a trade deal between the US and China. However, separate SCMP reports, also citing sources, suggested that the US may delay the December 15th tariffs if trade a pact is not reached by then, a move that would allay fears of a re-escalation in trade tensions.</p><p><strong>* EU AUTO TARIFFS: </strong>Politico broke a story that the Trump administration is mulling a trade investigation against the EU, as time for imposing auto tariffs is limited, according to people briefed on the matter. The report noted that such a move would mean that European auto imports wouldn't be subject to duties out of national security concerns, but the trading bloc would be subject to a much broader inquiry. It is worth highlighting, yesterday trade law experts stated time has run out for US President Trump to impose the Section 232 tariffs on EU and Japanese automakers, given Trump’s self-imposed deadline. The experts added that if the White House wants to impose them, they will have to take a different course.</p><p><strong>* USMCA: </strong>US House Speaker Pelosi initially stated she was hopeful when asked if she can reach a deal on USMCA when she meets with USTR Lighthizer today, however no concrete agreement was reached, although progress was made, particularly on the enforcement issue. Pelosi was eager to get a deal done but noted it would take time to write and put the bill into the house, adding there may not be enough time to set a ratification vote this year. However, House Ways and Means Chair Neal announced a house vote is still possibly by the end of 2019.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>As expected, the ECB’s Minutes from its latest policy meeting delivered little by way of fireworks, echoing the relatively uneventful nature of the meeting itself. Moreover, there was wide agreement that more information would be needed to reassess the inflation outlook and the impact of the monetary policy measures. A plea was made for patience to allow the measures taken in September to work through the economy, supporting a “wait and see” posture at the current juncture. However, it was observed that that the latest PMI data had been the lowest since 2012 and that its decline was the longest since the financial crisis, which the board noted suggests weakness is likely to persist for longer than anticipated in the September economic projections. “The tone of the minutes suggest that policymakers are coming around to a more pessimistic and, in our view, realistic assessment of the economic outlook” notes Capital Economics. Elsewhere, a strong call for the of unity of the Governing Council was made at the October Policy Meeting, the minutes revealed. “That is hardly surprising” says Capital Economics, “after all, no major decisions were on the table in October” and the fact that it was former ECB President Draghi’s last meeting and incoming ECB President Lagarde was sat in the room as an observer “may have encouraged participants to be on their best behaviour” posits the consultancy. At the September meeting, where major decisions were made (the ECB cut rates by 10bps, unveiled EUR 20bln per month in QE, sweetened the terms of the TLTRO and unveiled a tiered rate system), a sizeable minority of the hawks dissented. In this vein, CapEco anticipates further conflict over policy as the Bank continues to miss its 2% inflation target.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB's Mersch said it is about time for a single European banking market and some argue that the ECB should look much closer to home for unwarranted obstacles to consolidation. Mersch added that he would not exclude a revisit to the assessment criteria. Looking ahead, ECB President Lagarde will be speaking tomorrow. Given recent ECB sources, which alleged that policymakers had told Lagarde that decisions should be made by consensus rather than a simple majority and proposals should be distributed early and not front-run in public communications, there are some doubts about how much she will be willing to reveal about the future direction of policy, especially at such an early stage in her tenure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>Governor Poloz<strong> </strong>said he<strong> </strong>believes that we have monetary conditions about right given the situation, pushing back against more dovish comments from Deputy Governor Wilkins earlier in the week, who said that there is still room for policy manoeuvre, and that the BoC has other options such as forward guidance and LSAP to help weather storms.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed's Mester (2020 voter, hawk) said she sees risks tilted to the downside, but sees no sign that weakness is spreading to the wider economy. In fitting with Fed minutes which stated the current policy rate would remain appropriate, barring a material reassessment of the outlook, Mester said she would re-evaluate monetary policy if there were signs of weakness in either the labour market or the consumer, two areas of the economy that the Fed has characterised respectively as solid and strong at the latest FOMC meeting. Mester added that it is worth considering a Standard Repo Facility, something that has been under discussion since its first appearance in the June meeting minutes. On the outlook for growth, she expects the US economy to grow by an average of 2% this year and for inflation to be slightly below 2%.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES: </strong>Existing Home Sales for the month of October came in at 5.46mln, ever so slightly below expectations for 5.47mln whilst rising from 5.36mln which was revised lower from 5.38mln. Wells Fargo highlight the data continues to move in the right direction thanks to lower rates, highlighting the recent gains reflect a likely return to the slow and steady future increases, a move which “has become a hallmark of this expansion”. Wells Fargo conclude with lower borrowing costs should result with a rise in home sales, although noting that mortgage rates have ticked up slightly recently, they remain at record lows and thus likely maintaining a demand for resales.</p><p><strong>* US PHILLY FED: </strong>Headline rose to 10.4 from 5.6, beating expectations for a rise to 7.0. Although the headline was strong, internals were weak. New Orders declined to 8.4 from 26.2, prices paid fell to 7.8 from 16.8, employment to 21.5 from 32.9 and CapEx fell to 19.4 from 36.4. Pantheon note this is the strongest of regional Fed and PMI surveys when eyeing the headline. The consultancy raises the point that the region is relatively insulated from the trade war as it has a low dependence on exports to the nation. However, it is worth noting the strong headline print could be offset by a smaller sample as it only covers 100 companies, therefore sector specific or local factors could make a difference, the consultancy writes.</p><p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Initial claims in the latest week came in unchanged at 227k, with the prior revised higher from 225k, above the expected 219k, bringing the 4-week average up by 3.5k to 221k. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlights that the headline has hit a five-month high in two straight weeks, catching its attention. The consultancy points towards the California wildfires as a potential boost for the figures, with the state’s claims rising 6.5k, the largest increase by any state, but caveats that the state data operates with a one-week lag and California has the largest population, as of such, more data is needed to become confident in the assumption and to make any sort of macro call. “So far, all the downshift in job gains has been due to slower hiring; if layoffs rise too, payroll growth will weaken substantially further,” Pantheon concludes.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 3104, NASDAQ-100 -0.2% at 8266, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.2% at 27766</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.5%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; -0.5%, Energy&nbsp; 1.6%, Financials&nbsp; -0.1%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.2%, Industrials&nbsp; -0.2%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.5%, Materials&nbsp; -0.1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.3%, Utilities&nbsp; -0.4%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>L-Brands (LB) rallied today as its figures were very much inline but it provided better than expected Q4 profit guidance. Macy’s (M) traded lower on a revenue miss and a cut in FY EPS forecasts. Anaplan (PLAN) rallied on EPS and revenue beats and on higher guidance, whilst raising its FY20 revenue forecasts, boding well for the software space.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>According to sources, Charles Schwab (SCHW) are reportedly in talks to purchase TD Ameritrade (AMTD) for USD 26bln, above AMTD’s prior day closing market cap at 22.4bln sending both stocks higher. The deal (which sent E-Trade Financial (ETFC) lower by ~8%) between the two would result in a company with ~5trln in combined assets.&nbsp; The sources add a deal could be officially announced as soon as today. Elsewhere, Tiffany’s (TIF) rallied on an increased offer from LVMH (MC FP) for USD 130/shr, USD 10 shy of the stocks ATH’s; neither companies were available for comments. PayPal (PYPL) were hit after it announced it purchased Honey Science, a co. which recorded 100mln in annual sales and is a rapidly growing tech platform for shopping and rewards, for USD 4bln. Xerox (XRX) issued a letter to HP Inc. (HPQ) saying the offer is neither uncertain or highly conditional and has encouraged the HP board to avoid further delays. Urging the company to hold a “friendly” discussion before November 25th, or else it would take a hostile approach to the buyout. Elsewhere, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) completed its takeover of Celgene (CELG), where ServiceNow (NOW) replaced CELG in the S&amp;P 500. Towards the end of the session, source reports highlighted Coty (COTY) has caught potential offers on its Hair and Beauty brands valued at up to USD 7bln, with suitors consisting of: Unilever (ULVR LN/UL), Henkel and Colgate Palmolive (CL), Cinven and another PE fund, Advent, Blackstone (BX), KKR (KKR), CVC Capital and BC Partners, are also expected to bid<strong>. </strong>Sources conclude, COTY will start auctioning the brands in December.</p><p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Exxon Mobil (XOM) traded higher after source reports it is to sell USD 25bln worth of assets up from the previous USD 15bln, with asset sales in Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa. UBS analyst, Timothy Arcuri, downgraded KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT). The analyst downgraded KLAC and AMAT as he sees the Water Fab Equipment (WFE) Run-Rate peaking. LRCX also downgraded on the same reasoning, although the analyst noted it has better relative exposure. US President Trump announced he is mulling potential tariff exemptions for the name, which followed US President Trump’s visit to the Austin, Texas plant, where he also requested Apple to help establish 5G in the US.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 1.57 HIGHER AT USD 58.58/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 1.57 HIGHER AT USD 63.97/BBL. </strong>Crude has been bid since the morning, with WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 futures seeing highs just shy of USD 58.60/bbl for WTI and just above USD 64/bbl on Brent; well above yesterday’s highs of USD 57.25/bbl and USD 62.80/bbl respectively. Earlier in the session, OPEC+ sources suggested that an extension of existing cuts until June 2020 is the most likely occurrence at the cartels December meeting. This is in line with recent comments from Russian deputy Finance Minister Kolychev that deeper cuts would entail “more minuses than pluses” for Russia, combined with comments from other OPEC oil ministers and source reports that deeper cuts are unlikely. “Today’s price rally may add to the impression that an extension would be enough to support prices” notes Citi, who caution that this is “a risky proposition… since it would allow a larger first half 2020 surplus to develop”. Today’s price rally appears to be more of a function of optimism regarding the latest US/China trade updates, which have been mostly positive since the morning and helped to lift global equities off their lows.</p><p><strong>* OPEC+ SOURCES: </strong>According to sources,<strong> </strong>OPEC+ is likely to extend its existing production cut agreement until June 2020 and there are no plans for deeper cuts in December as of yet. The sources spoke of two main scenarios under a mid-2020 extension could occur; in the first, OPEC+ would meet in December and then decide to extend the current cuts until June and in the second, they would defer the decision until early next year and meet before March to see how the market looks and then extend the cuts until the middle of the year. The sources said formally announcing deeper cuts looks unlikely for now, instead a message about better compliance with existing cuts could be sent. One source added that market conditions in Q1 2020 remain unclear amid concerns of a slowdown in oil demand and weak compliance by some producers such as Iraq and Nigeria, which are complicating the outlook. Finally, the sources spoke of how the Saudis want to support oil prices ahead of its Aramco IPO, adding that ahead of this IPO, Russia will not “let the Saudis down” in case of an oil price collapse.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 10 TICKS LOWER AT 129.15+: </strong>The Treasury curve flattening found some pause on Thursday, where the T-note drifted lower throughout the session. Treasury market participants were cautiously more optimistic about the state of the US-China trade updates, as was Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, where it was also reported the US had been invited to Beijing for further talks. The TPLEX failed to catch a bid on the Hong Kong bill pessimism and the whole curve was approximately 3.5bps higher by settlement. Elsewhere, the US sold USD 12bln in 10-year TIPS at a high yield of 0.149%, stopping through the WI by 0.3bps with decent domestic demand.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>DXY</strong> largely took its directions from a flurry of conflicting US/China trade updates, however it ended the day higher with the latest reports leaning positive as source reports noted the US may delay the December 15th tariffs if a trade pact is not reached by then, said SCMP, although tariff removals are still holding up the talks. The dollar index moved higher since the report after initially finding lows at 97.722 but then rising throughout the remainder of the session to hit 98.00, a level it remains within a whisker off heading into Asia trade. Higher rates were also likely supportive for the buck. <strong>Havens</strong> were generally weaker today on the positive trade updates following a slew of negative stories the prior day with CHF and XAU lower against major counterparts. However, JPY was firmer against GBP, EUR and AUD, and flat against the greenback as it potentially may have been contained on large option expiries. <strong>CAD</strong> was firmer today amid higher oil prices, but mainly taking direction from BOC Governor Poloz comments, who believed that monetary conditions are about right given the situation, seemingly walking back on the comments from Wilkins who noted there is still policy room to manoeuvre, whilst highlighting forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases as methods to weather storms. The announcement, tied with positive USMCA updates from Pelosi, who was initially hopeful of reaching an agreement today, sent the Loonie briefly under its 200dma at 1.3275, before paring back to the key level amid a lack of USMCA updates. In <strong>EMFX</strong>, ZAR the outperformer today as the SARB left rates unchanged at 6.5% and providing CPI forecasts of 4.2%, both as expected. MXN also performed well on the aforementioned USMCA comments, however no final agreement appeared to be reached and there was some questioning whether the deal could get a ratification vote by the end of the year, although progress was made with USTR Lighthizer. BRL was flat, as was TRY, albeit marginally weaker on renewed criticisms from the US regarding its S-400 missile defence system.</p><p><strong>* SARB: </strong>As expected, the SARB held its repo rate at 6.5%. In the statement, CPI was seen averaging 4.2% (in-line with forecasts) and monthly inflation was noted to have been lower than the target ranges mid-point. TD Securities notes that the statement contains a mixture of hawkish and dovish elements; undoubtedly, both inflation and growth provide strong support for lowering interest rates, while SARB also characterised the international environment is one of benign inflationary pressures. Indeed, in the statement it was noted that inflation expectations have continued to moderate, although the outlook for inflation was left largely unchanged from the prior meeting. Moreover, two of the five voting members preferred a 25bps rate cut, compared to unanimous decision to hold rates in September. So what is stopping the bank from cutting? “We think that the SARB's main concern is the potentially adverse implications of a Moody's downgrade to junk of South Africa next year” says TD. Governor Kganyago and the rest of the MPC confirmed this fear in the statement, where it was acknowledged that the large-scale selloff that would come as a consequence of SAGB's expulsion from the WGBI and other global bond indices poses a significant upside threat to the inflation forecast. “The SARB is unlikely to cut until it achieves more clarity on Moody's intentions” concludes TD. Moody's next rating review of South Africa is likely to be scheduled sometime after the country’s budget presentation in March next year.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>USD and DXY are poised to end European session relatively flat after nursing losses seen in early hours, in light of hopeful comments from China and signals of upmost dedication to reach a deal with the US. Sources also noted that there is still optimism that a watered-down deal between the nations, adding that the Dec 15 tariffs may be delayed even if a deal proves elusive. That said, the passage of the HK Human Rights bill may prove a wedge in talks given mounting expectations for President Trump to take the bill to law, in which case Beijing is expected to react, according to Chinese sources cited by SCMP. Data-wise State-side, initial jobless claims (on payroll week) came in higher than forecasts (227k vs. Exp. 219K), whilst Philly Fed manufacturing topped estimates, but new orders slumped from the prior month; USD was little swayed on the mixed data. Overall the Index is poised to end the day with modest losses and towards the middle of today’s 97.72-97.93 parameter. Conversely, the CNH heads into the end of the EU session modestly firmer and supported by the overall encouraging rhetoric from China. USD/CNH remained below 7.0400 throughout a bulk of EU trade having briefly topped its 100 DMA (7.0427) before finding a base at 7.0250. Looking ahead and aside from trade headlines, European flash PMIs and University of Michigan sentiment are likely to garner attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling took a top spot in the G10 ranks with little by way of immediate fundamental news flow driving the upside. Zooming out to the bigger picture and with elections looming, the less Labour makes progress with its campaign the more likely the market-friendly Tories will take office, which could be underpinning the Pound as time elapses. Cable has risen to around 1.2950 vs. lows of 1.2920 after taking out offers around 1.2945. Meanwhile, the Single Currency saw little individual action and with ECB minutes a non-event as expected, participants are now gearing up for tomorrow’s first speech by ECB President Lagarde alongside Flash PMIs - with expectations for a modest rebound from last month. EUR/USD poised to end the EU day flat around 1.1075 as the Buck rises off lows with pair having traded in a 1.1070-96 intraday range (briefly topping its 100 DMA at 1.1087).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD, NZD, AUD</strong></p><p>The Loonie stands as one of the G10 winners following a one-liner from BoC Governor Poloz who backed current monetary conditions given the economic situation, thus leaning back on some of the comments from Wilkins earlier in the week on policy room to manoeuvre and other options. USD/CAD reversed earlier upside before taking out its 100 DMA at 1.3275, having fluctuated within a 1.3269-3325 range and potentially experiencing tailwind from higher energy prices. Meanwhile, the Kiwi and Aussie have largely been moving in tandem with the Dollar amid mixed trade sentiment. NZD/USD and AUD/USD look set to end the EU session flat just above 0.6400 and around 0.6800 respectively having both clocked in around 30-40 pip intraday ranges whilst AUD/NZD remains unchanged within a tight range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Mostly flat/lower on the day with the USD/JPY mostly effected by its base currency and potentially contained by mammoth options expiries at the NY cut. USD/JPY is set to end EU trade flat having dipped to a low of 108.30 (50 DMA) before recoiling back to around 108.50. Meanwhile, the Franc remains modestly softer with EUR/CHF having rebounded off its 50 and 100 DMAs both coinciding at 1.0957 (intraday low) before testing 1.1000 to the upside but failing a breach.</p>",

However, global equities were lifted off overnight lows on more upbeat comments from Chinese Vice Premier Liu, who said he is cautiously optimistic about agreeing a Phase One deal with US and remains confident but confused about US demands, whilst the WSJ report on China inviting US negotiators for a meeting also aided sentiment. Sectors are mostly in the red, barring Telecoms (-0.1%), with the more defensive Utilities (+0.2%) and Consumer Staples (-0.2%) holding up slightly better. In terms of notable movers; Tobacco names Imperial Brands (+0.8%) and British American Tobacco (+3.0%) received a boost from the news that US regulators have dropped a plan to sharply reduce nicotine content in cigarettes, with the former affected by ex-divs. Topping the Stoxx 600 chart is Centrica (+8.2%), who maintained its FY outlook, which some desks noted is a positive turn around after a series of downgrades to its outlook. Conversely, the notable Stoxx 600 loser is Royal Mail (-16.2%), who warned that revenue and cost headwinds could possibly result in a break-even or loss-making position for UK business in 2020-21 whilst warnings that its transformation plan to expand its parcels business internationally was behind schedule. Another laggard is ThyssenKrupp (-10.3%), sinking post-earnings on the news that the Co. will not achieve its medium-term targets set for 2020/21, with a weak economy weighing on margins, thus its peers Salzgitter (-1.4%) and ArcelorMittal (-2.2%) are lower in sympathy. Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (-1.8%) is under pressure after General Motors yesterday filed a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler and three former executives, asserting that it bribed UAW officials to get more favourable contract terms. A Fiat Chrysler spokesperson said that the Co. believes GM is trying to disrupt its merger with PSA (-0.6%), who opened lower in sympathy but have since come off worst levels. Separately, LVMH (-1.1%) upped its offer for Tiffany &amp; Co. to USD 130/shr the previous USD 120/shr offer, prompting Tiffany to open its books and thus upping the chances of a deal, according to sources. Finally, Sanofi (+1.6%) sharply reversed early losses on the news that the Co. is mulling options for its USD 30bln consumer health unit.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US Defence Secretary Esper said US does not regret taking high road on halting joint drills, while he added that North Korea's response was not positive and that he hasn't heard of reports to withdraw troops from South Korea. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong> - The broad Dollar and Index have drifted off overnight highs in early EU trade in wake of upbeat comments from China’s MOFCOM, who reaffirmed determination to reach a Phase One deal whilst dismissing rumours of disagreements in discussions. This follow comments from Chinese Vice Premier overnight who expressed cautious optimism regarding a deal. However, markets are gathering focus around the Hong Kong Human Rights bill, which was almost unanimously passed by the House overnight, with sources stating that US President Trump plans to sign the bill, which could be on his desk as soon as today. The bill could potentially imperil the trade deal between the two nations and is facing fierce backlash from Chinese officials. DXY remains below 98.00 (having shown little reaction to the FOMC Minutes) and has dipped under its 21 DMA and WMAs both coinciding around 97.86-87 to a session low of 97.80. The CNH meanwhile remains little changed on the day, albeit choppy as it balances trade optimism with potential ramifications from the HK bill. USD/CNH trades near the bottom of its current 7.0350-0530 range having earlier dipped below its 100 DMA (7.0428). CNH then saw a mild bout of strength amid sources reports noting that China last week invited US negotiators for further talks.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, JPY</strong> - All modestly firmer and moving in tandem to the weakening USD as conflicting trade sentiment provide little to move on, although late source reports on China inviting US negotiators underpinned the antipodeans and influence mild outflow in the JPY. AUD climbed off overnight lows (0.6785) to reclaim 0.6800+ status ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6812 (with AUD 1bln expiring at strikes 0.6800-10) whilst its Kiwi counterpart remains above 0.6400 (0.6424 current intraday high) having earlier tested the figure to the downside. Similarly, safe-havens remain firmer; USD/JPY trades just above 108.50 (current intraday range 108.30-66) looking ahead to a barrage of option expiries at 108.25-35 (1.7bln), 108.40-50 (2.7bln) abd 108.65-75 (1.3bln), whilst technicians will be eyeing resistance and support 108.74 (21 DMA) and 108.27 (50 DMA) respectively.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP </strong>- Once again, Sterling and the Single currency move in lockstep to the Dollar with little on the domestic front to spark individual movements ahead of the Labour manifesto release later today. Cable took out touted offers at 1.2945 ahead of more at 1.2950 with around 1bln in options expiring at 1.2955-65 and a further 1.8bln around 1.2990-1.300. Meanwhile, EUR/USD eclipsed its 100 DMA at 1.1087-88 in early trade with the next level to the upside its 21 WMA at 1.1094.

However, global equities were lifted off overnight lows on more upbeat comments from Chinese Vice Premier Liu, who said he is cautiously optimistic about agreeing a Phase One deal with US and remains confident but confused about US demands, whilst the WSJ report on China inviting US negotiators for a meeting also aided sentiment. Sectors are mostly in the red, barring Telecoms (-0.1%), with the more defensive Utilities (+0.2%) and Consumer Staples (-0.2%) holding up slightly better. In terms of notable movers; Tobacco names Imperial Brands (+0.8%) and British American Tobacco (+3.0%) received a boost from the news that US regulators have dropped a plan to sharply reduce nicotine content in cigarettes, with the former affected by ex-divs. Topping the Stoxx 600 chart is Centrica (+8.2%), who maintained its FY outlook, which some desks noted is a positive turn around after a series of downgrades to its outlook. Conversely, the notable Stoxx 600 loser is Royal Mail (-16.2%), who warned that revenue and cost headwinds could possibly result in a break-even or loss-making position for UK business in 2020-21 whilst warnings that its transformation plan to expand its parcels business internationally was behind schedule. Another laggard is ThyssenKrupp (-10.3%), sinking post-earnings on the news that the Co. will not achieve its medium-term targets set for 2020/21, with a weak economy weighing on margins, thus its peers Salzgitter (-1.4%) and ArcelorMittal (-2.2%) are lower in sympathy. Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (-1.8%) is under pressure after General Motors yesterday filed a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler and three former executives, asserting that it bribed UAW officials to get more favourable contract terms. A Fiat Chrysler spokesperson said that the Co. believes GM is trying to disrupt its merger with PSA (-0.6%), who opened lower in sympathy but have since come off worst levels. Separately, LVMH (-1.1%) upped its offer for Tiffany &amp; Co. to USD 130/shr the previous USD 120/shr offer, prompting Tiffany to open its books and thus upping the chances of a deal, according to sources. Finally, Sanofi (+1.6%) sharply reversed early losses on the news that the Co. is mulling options for its USD 30bln consumer health unit.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong> - The broad Dollar and Index have drifted off overnight highs in early EU trade in wake of upbeat comments from China’s MOFCOM, who reaffirmed determination to reach a Phase One deal whilst dismissing rumours of disagreements in discussions. This follow comments from Chinese Vice Premier overnight who expressed cautious optimism regarding a deal. However, markets are gathering focus around the Hong Kong Human Rights bill, which was almost unanimously passed by the House overnight, with sources stating that US President Trump plans to sign the bill, which could be on his desk as soon as today. The bill could potentially imperil the trade deal between the two nations and is facing fierce backlash from Chinese officials. DXY remains below 98.00 (having shown little reaction to the FOMC Minutes) and has dipped under its 21 DMA and WMAs both coinciding around 97.86-87 to a session low of 97.80. The CNH meanwhile remains little changed on the day, albeit choppy as it balances trade optimism with potential ramifications from the HK bill. USD/CNH trades near the bottom of its current 7.0350-0530 range having earlier dipped below its 100 DMA (7.0428). CNH then saw a mild bout of strength amid sources reports noting that China last week invited US negotiators for further talks.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, JPY</strong> - All modestly firmer and moving in tandem to the weakening USD as conflicting trade sentiment provide little to move on, although late source reports on China inviting US negotiators underpinned the antipodeans and influence mild outflow in the JPY. AUD climbed off overnight lows (0.6785) to reclaim 0.6800+ status ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6812 (with AUD 1bln expiring at strikes 0.6800-10) whilst its Kiwi counterpart remains above 0.6400 (0.6424 current intraday high) having earlier tested the figure to the downside. Similarly, safe-havens remain firmer; USD/JPY trades just above 108.50 (current intraday range 108.30-66) looking ahead to a barrage of option expiries at 108.25-35 (1.7bln), 108.40-50 (2.7bln) abd 108.65-75 (1.3bln), whilst technicians will be eyeing resistance and support 108.74 (21 DMA) and 108.27 (50 DMA) respectively.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP </strong>- Once again, Sterling and the Single currency move in lockstep to the Dollar with little on the domestic front to spark individual movements ahead of the Labour manifesto release later today. Cable took out touted offers at 1.2945 ahead of more at 1.2950 with around 1bln in options expiring at 1.2955-65 and a further 1.8bln around 1.2990-1.300. Meanwhile, EUR/USD eclipsed its 100 DMA at 1.1087-88 in early trade with the next level to the upside its 21 WMA at 1.1094. Large options expiries for the pair reside at 1.1090 (1.4bln) and 1.1100-10 (1bln) for today’s NY cut, with little fireworks expected from the ECB Minutes.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>The debt complex has taken a slight downturn following a relatively unchanged start to the session, on the latest updates to the US-China trade saga; in which, reports indicate that last week China invited US trade negotiators to further discussions.

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index have drifted off overnight highs in early EU trade in wake of upbeat comments from China’s MOFCOM, who reaffirmed determination to reach a Phase One deal whilst dismissing rumours of disagreements in discussions. This follow comments from Chinese Vice Premier overnight who expressed cautious optimism regarding a deal. However, markets are gathering focus around the Hong Kong Human Rights bill, which was almost unanimously passed by the House overnight, with sources stating that US President Trump plans to sign the bill, which could be on his desk as soon as today. The bill could potentially imperil the trade deal between the two nations and is facing fierce backlash from Chinese officials. DXY remains below 98.00 (having shown little reaction to the FOMC Minutes) and has dipped under its 21 DMA and WMAs both coinciding around 97.86-87 to a session low of 97.80. The CNH meanwhile remains little changed on the day, albeit choppy as it balances trade optimism with potential ramifications from the HK bill. USD/CNH trades near the bottom of its current 7.0350-0530 range having earlier dipped below its 100 DMA (7.0428)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, JPY</strong></p><p>All modestly firmer and moving in tandem to the weakening USD as conflicting trade sentiment provide little to move on. AUD climbed off overnight lows (0.6785) to reclaim 0.6800+ status ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6812 (with AUD 1bln expiring at strikes 0.6800-10) whilst its Kiwi counterpart remains above 0.6400 (0.6424 current intraday high) having earlier tested the figure to the downside. Similarly, safe-havens remain firmer; USD/JPY straddles 108.50 (current intraday range 108.30-66) looking ahead to a barrage of option expiries at 108.25-35 (1.7bln), 108.40-50 (2.7bln) abd 108.65-75 (1.3bln), whilst technicians will be eyeing resistance and support 108.74 (21 DMA) and 108.27 (50 DMA) respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>Once again, Sterling and the Single currency move in lockstep to the Dollar with little on the domestic front to spark individual movements ahead of the Labour manifesto release later today. Cable took out touted offers at 1.2945 ahead of more at 1.2950 with around 1bln in options expiring at 1.2955-65 and a further 1.8bln around 1.2990-1.300. Meanwhile, EUR/USD eclipsed its 100 DMA at 1.1087-88 in early trade with the next level to the upside its 21 WMA at 1.1094. Large options expiries for the pair reside at 1.1090 (1.4bln) and 1.1100-10 (1bln) for today’s NY cut, with little fireworks expected from the ECB Minutes.</p>",

Bunds reside at the bottom of a circa 40 tick range for the day, and appear to have found a base just above the 171.0 mark; however, from a technical perspective a breach below this would present a clear run until the psychological 170.50 figure, with further support below at 170.26. Similarly, gilts are at the lower end of their range, as we await the release of the Labour party’s manifesto later today with the general election now 3-weeks away. In contrast, BTP’s are the marked outperformer this morning with gains in excess of 40 ticks at best, upcoming supply via Spain and France could be presenting some support for this relative outperformance; OATs and Bonos are flat ahead of this issuance (preview available within the RANsquawk headline feed). Finally, USTs are mirroring the performance of core European counterparts, with little in the way of action occurring in yield terms; ahead of data and two 2020 Fed voters later in the session; for reference, the Fed minutes yesterday did not provide any fresh policy clues.</p>",

Furthermore, policymakers said risks remained tilted to the downside and they all agreed negative rates are not an attractive tool but could reassess if need be. <strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets declined across the board with risk sentiment rattled by increased trade pessimism after source reports noted the US-China phase one deal may not be completed this year</strong> and US President Trump suggested China is not stepping up to the level he wants. In addition, the House passage of the Hong Kong rights bill which President Trump is expected to sign, added another front to the trade uncertainty. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.5)</strong> traded negatively with Australia dragged by underperformance in trade sensitive sectors such as tech, materials, and industrials, while Tokyo exporters suffered the ill-effects from safe-haven flows into the domestic currency. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%)</strong> were also downbeat on the trade-related doubts and with China media outlets continuing to voice their backlash to the US ‘interference’, while the losses in Hong Kong initially snowballed as all components in its benchmark index briefly resided in the red, although there was mild relief following comments from Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who was cautiously optimistic about reaching an agreement and remained confident despite being confused regarding US demands. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned by the early safe-haven demand although gains were later capped as advances in T-notes stalled around the 130.00 level and with the BoJ only in the market today for Treasury Discount bills.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

The reports added that US President Trump and US Trade Representative Lighthizer recognize that rolling back tariffs for a deal that fails to address core IP and technology transfer issues will not be seen as a good deal for the US. In addition, <strong>the People's Daily noted Chinese President Xi's trip to Brazil was the last international trip for him this year which suggested no international trade deal signing is scheduled</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he doesn't think China is stepping up to the level he wants in trade talks and that China wants a trade deal more than he does.</strong> US President Trump had earlier stated the US continues to talk with China which wants a deal and suggested that the question is if he wants to make a deal, because he likes what's happening right now with the US taking in billions and billions of dollars. (Newswires/Twitter)</p><p><strong>Chinese Vice Premier Liu said he is cautiously optimistic about agreeing a phase one deal with US and that he remains confident but confused about US demands</strong>. In related news, a China state think tank economist also said it is still likely for a phase one deal with US to be reached this year if there is no disturbance, while the economist added a global financial crisis is not far off if US and China keep fighting. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US House has voted to pass the Hong Kong bill as expected and sent it to US President Trump for signature or veto, while source reports later noted President Trump is expected to sign the bill.</strong> (Newswires) Hong Kong Government said it strongly oppose US house passing Hong Kong bill which won’t help ease social unrest and sends the wrong signal to the violent protesters. (Newswires)</p><p>People's Daily commentary stated the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is a piece of wastepaper that interferes in China's internal affairs, while China Global Times tweeted that the US Senate's move on Hong Kong bill will hurt US investments in Hong Kong and may lead to retaliation citing an expert. Elsewhere, CNBC's Yoon tweeted that China will double down on attacks of US Congress after the House passed legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters, while she suggested both China and the US will not want to link the Hong Kong bill to current trade talks and also tweeted the Chinese feel the US is the one that needs to make the next move with tariff rollbacks to show sincerity, make deal “balanced” and give Beijing face. (People’s Daily/Twitter)</p><p>Chinese Premier Li said China's economy maintained stable performance this year and that China will keep macro policies stable, while it needs to use all possible means to lower real interest rates. Premier Li added China will stick to its reform agenda and that both foreign and domestic companies will be treated as equals regardless of ownership structure.

(Twitter)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> slightly softened amid the US-China trade uncertainty and following a pullback from resistance around 98.00, while the prior session’s FOMC Minutes provided little to sway the currency. The greenback’s major counterpart’s were relatively stable and held on to the prior day’s gains with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> eyeing a large option expiry for today’s New Yok cut at 1.1090, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> lightly prodded yesterday’s highs. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was subdued by the risk appetite but found mild relief after the comments from China’s top trade negotiator, while antipodeans were lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses, China trade exposure and following a weaker CNY reference rate setting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities traded quiet overnight with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures mildly pulling back below the USD 57.00/bbl level as it takes a breather from the prior day’s over 3% rally to recoup Tuesday’s hefty losses. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> kept to within a relatively tight range and failed to benefit from a slightly weaker greenback, broad risk averse tone and a following an uneventful FOMC minutes release, and <strong>copper</strong> remained subdued as sentiment was further dampened by the increased US-China trade pessimism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US Defence Secretary Esper said US does not regret taking high road on halting joint drills, while he added that North Korea's response was not positive and that he hasn't heard of reports to withdraw troops from South Korea. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The TPLEX was supported on Wednesday by sentiment on the likelihood of a US-China trade deal becoming more pessimistic. The haven asset was already on the front-foot throughout the Asia session, following the pro-democracy HK bill in the US, and then caught a second wind on reports the trade deal was unlikely to be signed this week. The curve continued to bull-flatten with the FOMC minutes confirming a Fed on pause, barring a material worsening of the outlook. The 2s30s flattened by 3bps, with the 30-year yield down 6bps. US T-note (Z9) futures settled 11+ ticks higher at 129-25+.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia markets are lower across the board with risk sentiment rattled by increased trade pessimism after source reports noted the US-China phase one deal may not be completed this year and US President Trump suggested China is not stepping up to the level he wants. In addition, the House passage of the Hong Kong rights bill which President Trump is expected to sign, adds another front to the trade uncertainty. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) are lower with the declines in Australia led by underperformance in trade sensitive sectors such as tech, materials, miners and industrials, while Tokyo exporters suffer the ill effects from safe haven flows into the domestic currency. Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are also downbeat on the trade-related doubts and with China media outlets continuing to voice their backlash to the US ‘interference’, while the PBoC also refrained from liquidity operations and with the losses in Hong Kong snowballing as all components in its benchmark index initially resided in the red, although their was mild relief following comments from Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who was cautiously optimistic about reaching an agreement and remains confident despite being confused regarding US demands.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer amid the US-China trade uncertainty and following a pullback from resistance around the 98.00 level, while the prior session’s FOMC Minutes provided little to sway the currency as most Fed policymakers judged that after the October 30th rate cut, the policy level would be appropriate barring a material reassessment of the outlook. The greenback’s major counterpart’s are relatively stable and hold on to the prior day’s gains with EUR/USD steadily edging closer towards a large option expiry for today’s New Yok cut at 1.1090, while GBP/USD prods yesterday’s highs as the latest Savanta/ComRes poll shows the Conservatives lead widening with support at 42% (+1) vs. Labour at 31% (-2) and Europe Elects seat projection also suggests the Conservatives are likely to get a majority in Parliament with a projected 354 seats. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was subdued by the risk appetite but found mild relief after the comments from China’s Vice Premier and top trade negotiator, while antipodeans are lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses, China trade exposure and following a weaker CNY reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand although gains are capped as advances in T-notes stalled around the 130.00 level and with the BoJ only in the market today for Treasury Discount bills.</p>",
