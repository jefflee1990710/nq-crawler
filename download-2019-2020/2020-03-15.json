(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks made strong gains on Friday in the Asia and Europe session, after another large sell-off on Thursday, before paring somewhat in US trade, and then experiencing a late session ramp to highs. Coordinated / uncoordinated fiscal and monetary responses to the COVID-19 outbreak continue to grow, where Trump declared a state of emergency to free up funds, the BoC and Canadian Government announced a rate cut and fiscal stimulus, Norges Bank made an emergency rate cut, and several other central banks announced liquidity measures, all on Friday. The equity gains were widespread with all sectors in positive territory, Financials leading as yields rose across the curve in a bear steepening fashion; although Utilities were a relative underperformer, as was Energy following crude prices coming off their highs on Russia announcing production ramp-up plans. Cruise liners &amp; Airlines bounced after the heavy sell off on Thursday with cruise names; NCLH, CCL, RCL, seeing heavy gains at the open, although pared back somewhat throughout the day, barring the late session, Trump-induced ramp, while airlines, AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, also saw solid gains. SPX +9.21% at 2709, NDX +10% at 7995, DJIA +9.34% at 23181.</p><p>The TPLEX bear steepened again on Friday amid a renewed risk appetite. The Treasury selling coincided with strength in equities, following on from Thursday where both were sold amid a flight to cash. It is possible that the move in government debt was less correlated to risk appetite and more to technical factors, such as the ongoing duration selling by risk parity-type players, as well as profit taking from exhausted levels, as has broadly been suggested in recent sessions. The TPLEX did find a bid after the NY Fed stepped into move forward its Treasury purchase schedule, although it ultimately proved short-lived, as the selling pressures resumed heading into settlement. The 10-year yield rose by around 9bps to just over 0.94%, while the 2-year yield remained unchanged at 0.48%. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point 3 ticks lower at 135-25+.</p>",
