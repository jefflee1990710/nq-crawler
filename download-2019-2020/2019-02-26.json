        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 26 Feb 2019: Powell sticks to the script; OPEC says it will stick to the script",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities flat, dollar down, Treasuries up, crude up.<br />* REAR VIEW: Fed Chair Powell reiterates January&rsquo;s FOMC minutes in Senate testimony, Housing Starts tumble, Consumer Confidence beats, Theresa May gains wiggle room, EU warms to an A50 extension, Buhari likely to remain Nigerian President, strong 7-year auction<br />* AHEAD: Australian Construction Work, EZ Economic Sentiment, Canadian CPI, US Factory Orders, Japanese Industrial Output, BoJ&rsquo;s Kataoka Speaking, ECB&rsquo;s Coeure &amp; Weidmann Speaking, Fed&rsquo;s Powell testifying before the House, German Auction, Earnings from: HP, Lowe&rsquo;s, Bayer, Ahold Delhaize, Rio Tinto, Taylor Wimpey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May has maneuvered to secure more breathing space in the event that her Meaningful Vote fails to pass the Lower House on March 12th. May stated that if the vote fails, she will offer a vote on a no deal Brexit (perhaps on 13 March, perhaps even on 12 March), and if that is rejected, a vote will follow on 14 March on an extension of Article 50. Effectively, this made the Cooper-Letwin-Boles proposed amendment redundant (which would have forced the Government to hand power to parliament if no UK-EU withdrawal deal has been approved by 13 March), and accordingly tomorrow&#39;s vote in Parliament is unlikely to garner much market attention. In terms of the way forward, Oxford Economics believes that of the three options offered by May, it is likely that Parliament will vote to seek a short extension of the Article 50: &quot;The EU is likely to agree to this request. But this will not change the fundamental choices available to MPs and recent events have not altered our view of the likelihood of the three possible end states &ndash; deal (60%), &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; (35%) or &ldquo;no Brexit&rdquo; (5%).&quot; The Europeans themselves have made noises on Tuesday that an extension would be do-able (German Chancellor Merkel&#39;s caucus said it could accept a Brexit delay until the end of June, but further than that would be impossible).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL SENATE TESTIMONY: </strong>There was nothing particularly new in Fed chair Powell&#39;s testimony to the Senate. The themes were very similar to the January meeting minutes and recent comments from Fed policymakers (Powell was testifying in his capacity as Fed Chair). Powell still sees the US economy as &quot;solid&quot; (in line with the description within the FOMC&#39;s policy statement), financial conditions are less supportive than they were last year (sa he has previously said); Powell noted the growth slowdown in Europe and China (also not new) and highlighted Brexit risks. Powell agains said the Fed would be patient in policy normalisation, and that normalisation will depend in incoming data. On inflation, analysts noted he seemed relaxed, arguing that the tick-up in wages this year is not a concern, in fact, it was a &quot;welcome development.&quot; Comments on the balance sheet were largely a repeat, too; Powell said that the FOMC is prepared to adjust the details for completing balance sheet normalisation, and (perhaps slightly new, if not slightly obvious) it was appropriate that the Fed evaluate the timing and approach for the end of the balance sheet run off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* HOUSING STARTS: </strong>December housing starts tanked, printing 1.078mln, well below the expected 1.25mln, whilst building permits increased marginally to 1.326mln, above the expected 1.29mln. The plunge in housing marks the third month of declines in four. Analysts at Wells Fargo Economics said &ldquo;with mortgage rates now lower, sales and starts are poised for a rebound.&rdquo; Looking beneath the surface, single-family starts fell for a fourth consecutive month at -6.7%, &ldquo;which was accurately depicted by the monthly homebuilders&rsquo; survey, provided a much-needed wake-up call for the Fed and was likely one of the key factors influencing its decision to put any further interest rate hikes on hold.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>The Conference Board&rsquo;s gauge of consumer confidence surged to 131.4 in February, beating the expected 124.9 and bouncing from January&rsquo;s 121.7 figure; the differential between jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get rose to 34.3 (Prev. 32.0). Analysts at Pantheon noted &ldquo;most of the increase in the headline index is due to a 14-point increase in the expectations index, which has now reversed about three fifths of the drop&hellip; In short, confidence is supportive of continued robust growth in consumers&rsquo; spending, though the short-term data often don&rsquo;t move in line.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.02 HIGHER AT USD 55.50/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.45 HIGHER AT USD 65.21/BBL.</strong> Crude traded higher on Tuesday ahead of weekly inventory data, on news that OPEC+ producers are likely to stay the course in curbing excess supply, rather than taking US President Trump&#39;s advice to &#39;take it easy&#39;. The news helped to mitigate the downside bias on reports that Libyan officials are said to have a framework agreement that could allow El Sharara (315k BPD capacity) and El Feel (70k BPD capacity) to restart; the NOC itself intimated that militants would need to leave the oilfields before production can resume (As it has continued to argue since Sharara become occupied in December). After the bell, analysts expect the API will report weekly crude stocks +2.8mln, distillates -2.0mln, gasoline -1.7mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP&#39;S OPTIONS TO TACKLE HIGH OIL PRICES: </strong>The impact of Trump&#39;s tweets on Monday expressing his distaste for high oil prices continues to be felt, with Brent pushed back into the 60-64 range it has been patrolling for most of this year. Will Trump&#39;s latest intervention see OPEC bend to his will? UBS thinks not, arguing that &quot;after being blindsided by Iran sanctions waivers following a period of significant production growth designed to prevent an oil price spike, OPEC is unlikely to shift its stance to help achieve Trump&rsquo;s goal of a lower oil price, particularly as the tightening market at the moment owes much to US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela.&quot; Nevertheless, a concern remains about what Trump may do next. One area he may attack is by supporting anti-OPEC legislation which would eventually allow the DOJ to file antitrust charges against OPEC for manipulating oil prices; another option the US President has would be to use the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves to mitigate some of the pressure. &quot;Both might have a temporary impact on the oil price, but would not address underlying supply issues,&quot; UBS said, &quot;as long as Iranian and Venezuelan production remain under pressure (and it&#39;s difficult to see signs that the situation is changing for the better in either country), the OPEC+ production cuts serve mainly to accelerate a tightening that would happen anyway.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NIGERIA ELECTIONS: </strong>Oil traders continue to watch events in Nigeria; Polls have the incumbent Buhari ahead; if Buhari retains the Presidency, militants have threatened to attack oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta, presenting upside risks to oil prices. For what it is worth, at pixel time, Buhari has claimed unofficial numbers demonstrate he has won, and his supporters are preparing celebrations for later on Tuesday, and getting ready for Buhari to deliver an acceptance speech. The latest tally suggest that Buhari leads by 6.9mln vs. 5.3mln, though reports suggest the final tally could even be seen on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.1% at 2794, NDX +0.1% at 7123, DJI -0.1% at 26058. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.3%, Materials -0.5%, Industrials -0.3%, Cons Discretionary +0.2%, Cons Staples +0.1%, Healthcare -0.3%, Financials -0.2%, Tech +0.2%, Telecoms +0.1%, Utilities -0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>AutoZone (AZO) surged on Tuesday after reporting a beat on top and bottom line estimates as well as same store sales; competitor Advance Auto Parts (AAP) also benefitted. Caterpillar (CAT) dragged industrials after UBS downgraded the co., where it sees over half of its end markets peaking in 2019. Home Depot (HD) underperformed on disappointing EPS guidance. Discovery (DISCA) and Mosaic (MOS) both opened lower on disappointing earnings reports; conversely, J. M. Smucker opened higher on a strong earnings report. JPMorgan (JPM) traded lower following it providing tame profit guidance for the years ahead at its investor conference; CEO Jamie Dimon gave comments later saying he would stay for at least five more years, maybe more. Embraer (ERJ) traded higher following is shareholders voting in favour for its sale of its jet business to Boeing (BA). Tesla (TSLA) dipped on the open as its CEO came under pressure from the SEC again for tweeting company information, however the stock reversed course and moved into the green as the day progressed. Spotify (SPOT) was an underperformer following Warner Music suing the co. on its India launch. CenturyLink (CTL) suffered after BAML downgraded the stock, citing near term estimates being too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 9+ TICKS HIGHER AT 122-10+. </strong>Treasuries traded higher on Tuesday, supported by weak housing starts data and a strong 7-year auction. The T-plex saw a leg up on the release of December housing starts which tanked by a whopping 11.2%. Also providing support at the margin was Fed Chair Powell reminding markets at his Senate testimony that the Fed is in a patient, supportive mode. The upward path was exacerbated by two block buyers in the March 10-year contract, one of 12k contracts and one of 6k contracts. Demand also remained resilient in later trade where the US sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes, with strong demand exhibited through a bid-to-cover ratio at 2.6x and stopping through the when issued by 0.9bps, where the six-auction average comes in on the screws. Breaking down the buyers, direct bidders took their largest share (28.42%) since March 2014, indirect bidders however exhibited weak foreign demand where they took their smallest share in three years. Going into settlement, treasuries remained near highs with the 7-year yield falling the most, c. -3.5bps. Across the curve, the belly-to-long end of the curve saw the most steepening, with the 5s/30s widening by c. 1bps and the 2s/5s contracting by c. 0.5bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Excluding GBP, the majors did little of note. ING notes that days like this tend to support carry strategies, explaining that these strategies are predicated on lower volatility (improving risk-adjusted returns) and thus are performing well as G7 FX volatility sinks to the lowest levels since early last year. The bias of the DXY was slightly to the downside, though this might have been a function of month-end; Citi&#39;s model looks for modest selling of the buck, though of all of the pairings, the strongest buy signal generated was in EURUSD, which analysts suggest could counteract the impact of a tightening USD on SOMA day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>It was another day with another thin range in EURUSD; the early influence was on lumpy expiry levels (EUR 7bln rolled-off between 1.13 and 1.14 at today&#39;s NY cut), and there was little on the data/speakers front. But even after the NY cut had passed, the tight range continued, with little inspiration being provided by the Bund; some desks talk of a silver lining, and note that the EURUSD is spending a lot of time towards the top end of its recent range raises hopes (among EUR bulls) of a potential upside breakout on the cards. That will need a break of the 1.1375 fib level; there was an attempt to break and remain above that level, which ultimately petered out. At the margin, GBP strength may also have been providing some support for the single currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable set a new YTD high (1.3283) after reports that PM May was to offer a vote on extending Article 50 (as well as offering a vote on a no deal Brexit) if her deal doesn&#39;t pass Parliament on 12 March. The prevailing wisdom is that May&#39;s moves make a no deal Brexit less likely (see Brexit analysis above). Continued friendly GBP Brexit headlines -- which seem to be pivoting towards a softer Brexit thus diminishing the prospects the UK will crash out of the EU on 29 March without a trade deal -- have supported GBP. Some are now talking about GBP rising through 1.33, towards 1.3350; ING believes it is too early for that sort of talk. SocGen&#39;s back of the envelope scenarios have looked for GBP at 1.20 in one-year from now in a no-deal scenario, 1.40 if a no-deal is avoided, while a Second Referendum could start focussing minds on 1.50. In the more immediate term, UBS sales traders reiterate that GBP remains a &#39;buy on dips&#39; as long as the angling away from a hard Brexit continues. Key levels: 1.3090-3110, 1.3050-60, 1.3217 (YTD high), 1.3260, 1.3300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>the JPY could not hold on to ground above 111.00, and risk-off flows on Tuesday dragged USDJPY back beneath the figure. Offers have been reported between 111.00 and 111.10; with buying interest cited at 110.00 by some desks in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>The USD weakness continues to benefit the Antipodes, with little domestic data to drive price action. The Loonie has been knocked by US President Trump&#39;s comments on oil on Monday, which saw oil slip, dragging the CAD with it. CAD was also unable to participate in the bounce of cyclical currencies today, and was taking its cue from falling oil prices earlier in the session, only moving flat when crude made its way back into positive commentary on OPEC news. SocGen&#39;s strategists said that on the supposition that oil prices are settling into a broad range whose centre of gravity is above the current price, EUR/NOK and USD/CAD could be somewhat lower than this by mid-year. Traders will look to the CPI data on Wednesday for the next directional cue.</p>\r\n",

The news helped to mitigate the downside bias on reports that Libyan officials are said to have a framework agreement that could allow El Sharara (315k BPD capacity) and El Feel (70k BPD capacity) to restart; the NOC itself intimated that militants would need to leave the oilfields before production can resume (As it has continued to argue since Sharara become occupied in December). After the bell, analysts expect the API will report weekly crude stocks +2.8mln, distillates -2.0mln, gasoline -1.7mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TRUMP&#39;S OPTIONS TO TACKLE HIGH OIL PRICES: The impact of Trump&#39;s tweets on Monday expressing his distaste for high oil prices continues to be felt, with Brent pushed back into the 60-64 range it has been patrolling for most of this year. Will Trump&#39;s latest intervention see OPEC bend to his will? UBS thinks not, arguing that &quot;after being blindsided by Iran sanctions waivers following a period of significant production growth designed to prevent an oil price spike, OPEC is unlikely to shift its stance to help achieve Trump&rsquo;s goal of a lower oil price, particularly as the tightening market at the moment owes much to US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela.&quot; Nevertheless, a concern remains about what Trump may do next. One area he may attack is by supporting anti-OPEC legislation which would eventually allow the DOJ to file antitrust charges against OPEC for manipulating oil prices; another option the US President has would be to use the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves to mitigate some of the pressure. &quot;Both might have a temporary impact on the oil price, but would not address underlying supply issues,&quot; UBS said, &quot;as long as Iranian and Venezuelan production remain under pressure (and it&#39;s difficult to see signs that the situation is changing for the better in either country), the OPEC+ production cuts serve mainly to accelerate a tightening that would happen anyway.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* NIGERIA ELECTIONS: Oil traders continue to watch events in Nigeria; Polls have the incumbent Buhari ahead; if Buhari retains the Presidency, militants have threatened to attack oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta, presenting upside risks to oil prices. For what it is worth, at pixel time, Buhari has claimed unofficial numbers demonstrate he has won, and his supporters are preparing celebrations for later on Tuesday, and getting ready for Buhari to deliver an acceptance speech. The latest tally suggest that Buhari leads by 6.9mln vs. 5.3mln, though reports suggest the final tally could even be seen on Wednesday.</p>\r\n",

UBS notes around USD 98bln of cash flows, excluding the SOMA holdings, and include some USD 82bln of redemptions that fall due this week. With USD 113bln of Treasury supply this week, net supply is implied at USD 31.4bln. For the month-end Fed holdings, USD 12.5bln matures, with the Fed due to add USD 2.1bln to 2s, USD 2.1bln for 5s, and USD 1.7bln to 7s.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>RECENT AUCTIONS:&nbsp;</strong>TD Securities points out that auctions have performed well of late, with central banks&#39; pivoting dovish. &quot;Allotment data shows that recent fund takedowns at auctions have rebounded and foreign allotments have risen from the lows, hinting at stronger demand for auctions from both investment funds and foreign buyers,&quot; TD writes, &quot;we generally expect the coming week&#39;s auction series to go relatively well, particularly given our expectation for no further coupon auction size increases by Treasury for the remainder of 2019.&quot;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>MONDAY&rsquo;S 2YR, 5YR AUCTIONS: </strong>The 2-year auction was reasonable, stopping through 0.1bps, despite slightly softer cover. Indirect bidders, however, dropped significantly, with takedown at 38.6% vs 53.4% previously. The 5s auction stopped through 0.2bps, with cover coming in line with the priors.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>7s PREVIEW: </strong>The January auction saw b/c printing in line with 2018 monthly averages at 2.52 and in a general sense, performance has been mixed for the 7s with the January auction tailing by 0.3bps. At the last auction, participation from directs rose from 15% to 25%, with indirects falling and domestic allocation still relatively high at over 60%. Analysts at Barclays note that the growth in direct participation was &ldquo;largely driven by the increase in takedown from foreign investors&rdquo;. TD Securities also note that the sector remains somewhat rich on the curve and look for a &ldquo;78% buy side takedown at auction, with 61% to indirects and 17% to directs&rdquo;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost a case of &lsquo;buy the rumour, sell the fact&rsquo;, but with one important difference as UK PM May refrained from taking the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal off the table. Removing the so called cliff edge scenario had been widely touted alongside an extension to the March 29 Article 50 deadline following the latest Cabinet meeting to update on Brexit, but in the event she maintained 3 options - her deal, no deal or no Brexit at all. In terms of the next steps, the delayed meaningful vote will be held by March 12, or perhaps as soon as next week, and if Parliament disapproves again then a vote on no deal will take place on March 13, with a 3rd and final vote on delaying Britain&rsquo;s departure on March 14. Back to the Pound, Cable hit fresh ytd highs in the run up after breaching 1.3200 and the previous 2019 peak (1.3217), topping out just shy of 1.3240 and is now retesting support around 1.3180 where some intraday longs are said to be ready to take profit or liquidate positions. Elsewhere, Eur/Gbp filled in bids and triggered stops through 0.8625-20 on the way to a circa 0.8590 low before rebounding above 0.8600 as an EU official reaffirmed the bloc&rsquo;s stance that if the HoC fails to back a deal then the UK must request a delay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Usd and index have been volatile, albeit largely on the back of moves elsewhere, and with the latter briefly below its 30 DMA (96.315) to a marginal new low of 96.246 in wake of weak US housing starts that overshadowed above forecast permits, but recovering towards 96.500 with the aid of much better than expected consumer confidence. Not a lot new to glean from Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s prepared text, aside from perhaps a clearer hint that a decision on the balance sheet run-off may come at the next FOMC, as the focus shifts to the Q&amp;A.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit more slippage from 111.00+ overnight peaks amidst a broad turnaround in risk sentiment, but the headline pair only extended the downside to 110.67 and failed to sustain losses through its 100 DMA or really threaten option expiries below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars are still propping up the G10 table and victims of the aforementioned swing from risk appetite to aversion, while the Loonie was also undermined by another dip in oil prices amidst reports that Libya&rsquo;s Government and NOC are striving to lift the force majeure at Sharara pending militia leaving the field. Usd/Cad remains above 1.3200, albeit off 1.3235 highs, Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.7150 and Nzd/Usd is just off a 0.6871 low having been well contained below 0.6900 where a hefty 1.8 bn worth of option expiries rolled off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also ending Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session on a softer footing vs the Greenback, but still relatively rangebound as the single tried to probe further above 1.1350, but ran in to more technical resistance ahead of 1.1400 along with expiry interest. Meanwhile, the Franc failed maintain recovery momentum through parity yet again and is back below the psychological marker.</p>\r\n",

Powell has typically avoided rocking the boat at these sorts of events, and as such, we expect he will echo the key messages of the recent Fed meeting minutes, which were net/net neutral. The minutes suggested that there is a consensus view on the FOMC that the balance sheet run-off will conclude this year. Crucially, although US surprise indices and GDP trackers have been heading south, the FOMC still does not foresee any rate cuts this year; on the contrary, the message seems to be that if the economy evolves in line with the Fed&#39;s projections (made in December, and to be updated at its next policy meeting in March), then rate hikes may still be on the agenda.</li>\r\n  <li>Therefore, Powell will likely reiterate the data-dependent stance of the central bank. Given his testimony will be in a political arena, the Fed chair will almost inevitably face questions about the independence of the central bank (which he will likely defend again).</li>\r\n  <li>Some have suggested that the testimony to the House will take on a more social issues role, given members are majority Democrat and their Primary campaigns have begun; the testimony to the Senate may address matters concerning regulation, the outlook and rates (particularly, Trump&#39;s influence in these areas)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Whilst the January print essentially hit 3% (2.988%), analysts at ING expect the next potential hike to be pushed back to March as the next opportunity to use liquidity altering tools, an alteration in FX swaps portfolio, only becomes available then. Median forecasts see a cut to HUF 1.8tln by the end of March (HUF 2.0tln currently) and ING see this as key to decreasing &ldquo;crowded out liquidity&rdquo;.

One area he may attack is by supporting anti-OPEC legislation which would eventually allow the DOJ to fole antitrust charges against OPEC for manipulating oil prices; another option the US President has would be to use the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves to mitigate some of the pressure. &quot;Both might have a temporary impact on the oil price, but would not address underlying supply issues,&quot; UBS said, &quot;as long as Iranian and Venezuelan production remain under pressure (and it&#39;s difficult to see signs that the situation is changing for the better in either country), the OPEC+ production cuts serve mainly to accelerate a tightening that would happen anyway.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

(Newswires) This is relatively in-fitting with reports via The Telegraph over the weekend that PM May is considering a Brexit delay of two months in a bid to avoid Cabinet resignations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to propose formally ruling out a no-deal Brexit which could postpone the Brexit date by months; according to The Sun. The article stated that the Premier is not ruling out a no-deal Brexit willingly, and to avoid total Brexiteer meltdown, PM still wants to keep the option of no-deal alive for later in the year after any extension to Article 50. Aides are said to be split over whether May should make the major concession directly when she addresses Parliament. Furthermore, key figures such as Environment Secretary Michael Gove are expected to back the PM&rsquo;s move. The Sun&rsquo;s Political Editor, Tom Newton Dunn tweeted that PM May is convinced that it&rsquo;s now the only way she can stop Remain ministers passing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, which is viewed in No10 as &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;. (The Sun/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many as 15 ministers could resign and vote for the Cooper-Letwin motion unless PM May provides assurances on a no-deal Brexit today; according to Daily Mail. Ministers include Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Secretary of State for Justice David Gauke, Business Secretary Greg Clark. Other Tories who are said to be close to resigning to stop a no-deal include Scottish Secretary David Mundell, Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, Solicitor General Robert Buckland and Disabilities Minister Sarah Newton. This comes after a group of 23 dissidents met secretly at the Commons last night to discuss how to stop a no-deal Brexit. (Daily Mail)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITV&#39;s Brand tweets, &quot;Cabinet source suggesting to me that resignations at that level are now OFF. There is indeed an expectation that PM will deliver an assurance that Parliament will be able to avoid No Deal&quot;.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian PM Conte states that as part of the next budget law the government are considering an overhaul of tax expenditures; according to a paper; Adding that the govt&#39;s privatisation plan is limited to the real estate sector, strategic national assets will not be targeting and CDP the state lender may play a role. (Newswires) Following this, Italian Deputy PM Salvini says he has confidence in Finance Minister Tria and rules out a budget correction this year; according to a paper.

The FTSE 100 (-1.3%) is underperforming its peers weighed on by the currency effects of a strong pound, alongside poor performance in IAG (-4.6%) following the MSCI stating that it plans to delete the stock from MSCI Global Standard Indexes as of March 1st. Additionally impacted by Fresnillo (-7.6%) as the Co. state that they expect 2019 to be a challenging year. Sectors are mixed, with some underperformance in IT names, after Apple supplier ACC Technologies issued a profit warning. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Babcock (-4.8%) after the Co. issued guidance regarding restructuring costs ahead of Brexit. At the other end of the Stoxx 600 are BASF (+3.9%) who are firmly in the green following their earnings, which included a beat on Q4 EPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Sterling is the standout G10 outperformer ahead of the latest Brexit update from UK PM May amidst heightened speculation that she will bow to Cabinet pressure and pull a no deal scenario off the table and perhaps entertain an extension to the March 29 deadline if Parliament rejects the WA next month or next week. Buyers seem to be front running U-turns on the former if not both, with Cable breaching resistance around 1.3100, then circa 1.3150 (near the 50 WMA) and subsequently tripping stops at 1.3160 on its way to 1.3238 at best, so far and posting a new high for the year (Prior was 1.3217). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has retreated sharply to below&nbsp;0.86, and also filling sell orders that were reportedly sitting between 0.8625-20 on the way. BoE testimony to the TSC on February&rsquo;s QIR is now underway, but Brexit remains paramount and the PM is due to speak from 12.30GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD &ndash; The major laggards on a mixture of tempered US-China related risk appetite and softer/stable crude prices after President Trump&rsquo;s latest bearish interjection. Aud/Usd has duly retreated from Monday&rsquo;s peaks having faded ahead of loftier highs reached last week and is back below 0.7150 where previous resistance at the 50 DMA (0.7134) may now provide some technical support. However, the Loonie has not been able to hold above 1.3200 vs its US rival and the Kiwi is hovering closer to the base of a 0.6872-88 range with hefty option expiry interest likely to cap the upside ahead of the NY cut (1.8 bn at the 0.6900 strike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/EUR &ndash; All on a firmer footing vs the Greenback that is drifting lower with the index down to fresh, albeit marginal lows (DXY just shy of 96.300). Usd/Jpy has eased back from 111.00+ to a 110.76 low and the Franc has pared losses from parity+ again, while the single currency appears more intent on taking out chart hurdles that have been protecting a more pronounced approach towards 1.1400, like the 30 DMA at 1.1363. If broken, 1.1393 represents daily resistance and 1.1402 is a 50% Fib, while decent expiries lie from 1.1390-1.1400 (1.6 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note also, other large option expiries running off today include 2.4 bn in Eur/Usd between 1.1330-40, 1.8 bn in Nzd/Usd at 0.6900 and 2 bn in Eur/NOK at 9.8000 (vs current spot rate of 9.7800).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are still underperforming as the clock ticks down to potentially pivotal Brexit pronouncements from UK PM May, with the 10 year benchmark just off a new 123.82 Liffe trough and now through last Friday&rsquo;s intraday low having ventured above parity at one stage ahead of the BoE&rsquo;s latest TSC appearance (124.11 peak vs Monday&rsquo;s 124.08 close). Aside from bearish positioning ahead of the aforementioned 12.30GMT or so speech, UK bonds have also been subject to switching from Mar to Jun contracts as the rolls reach a crescendo if not climax ahead of expiry. Meanwhile, Bunds have been dragged down in sympathy to a degree, but also negatively impacted by resurgent Eurozone peripheral paper and perhaps less dovish or downbeat ECB comments from Lane (next week&rsquo;s widely anticipated growth forecast downgrades won&rsquo;t be large, according to the chief economist in waiting). The 10 year German bond recently retreated to 166.20, just a tick off last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex base, and technically back within striking distance of other support levels ahead of 166.00. Turning to US Treasuries, and the reversal in core EU equivalents has nudged futures off overnight session peaks, but independent drivers await via data/surveys and primarily Powell part one before the final slug of issuance in the shape of Usd32 bn 7 year notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.3%) and WTI (+0.1%) prices are slightly firmer trading towards the top of the day&rsquo;s very narrow USD 1/bbl range, after a largely unchanged overnight session. In terms of recent news flow Saudi Aramco expect oil demand to increase substantially, with this predominantly driven by transport. Adding that in order to meet future demand growth long term investment is required. Elsewhere, BP&rsquo;s CEO has stated that oil prices within the range of USD 50-70/bbl works for both consumers and producers. Separately, the UAE are to host a meeting between the state oil firm and those involved in Libya&rsquo;s conflict in order to resolves the El Sharara oil filed situation; with the 300k BPD field remaining closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) is little changed with the yellow metal hovering towards the middle of its daily range, mimicking the dollar which is largely uneventful ahead of today&rsquo;s testimony by Fed Chair Powell to the Senate Banking Committee at 15:00GMT. Elsewhere, spot Palladium rose above USD 1550/oz, with the metal hitting a new high of USD 1554.50/oz; following strike threat by South African mineworkers added to supply concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un on Wednesday evening in Vietnam with a follow-up meeting on Thursday; according to the White House. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said Ottawa is exploring ways to expand sanctions on Venezuelan officials. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Foreign Minister Zarif announced his resignation. US Secretary of State Pompeo, following the resignation, said US policy is unchanged.

If broken, 1.1393 represents daily resistance and 1.1402 is a 50% Fib, while decent expiries lie from 1.1390-1.1400 (1.6 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note also, other large option expiries running off today include 2.4 bn in Eur/Usd between 1.1330-40, 1.8 bn in Nzd/Usd at 0.6900 and 2 bn in Eur/NOK at 9.8000 (vs current spot rate of 9.7800).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are still underperforming as the clock ticks down to potentially pivotal Brexit pronouncements from UK PM May, with the 10 year benchmark just off a new 123.82 Liffe trough and now through last Friday&rsquo;s intraday low having ventured above parity at one stage ahead of the BoE&rsquo;s latest TSC appearance (124.11 peak vs Monday&rsquo;s 124.08 close). Aside from bearish positioning ahead of the aforementioned 12.30GMT or so speech, UK bonds have also been subject to switching from Mar to Jun contracts as the rolls reach a crescendo if not climax ahead of expiry. Meanwhile, Bunds have been dragged down in sympathy to a degree, but also negatively impacted by resurgent Eurozone peripheral paper and perhaps less dovish or downbeat ECB comments from Lane (next week&rsquo;s widely anticipated growth forecast downgrades won&rsquo;t be large, according to the chief economist in waiting). The 10 year German bond recently retreated to 166.20, just a tick off last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex base, and technically back within striking distance of other support levels ahead of 166.00. Turning to US Treasuries, and the reversal in core EU equivalents has nudged futures off overnight session peaks, but independent drivers await via data/surveys and primarily Powell part one before the final slug of issuance in the shape of Usd32 bn 7 year notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.3%) and WTI (+0.1%) prices are slightly firmer trading towards the top of the day&rsquo;s very narrow USD 1/bbl range, after a largely unchanged overnight session. In terms of recent news flow Saudi Aramco expect oil demand to increase substantially, with this predominantly driven by transport. Adding that in order to meet future demand growth long term investment is required. Elsewhere, BP&rsquo;s CEO has stated that oil prices within the range of USD 50-70/bbl works for both consumers and producers. Separately, the UAE are to host a meeting between the state oil firm and those involved in Libya&rsquo;s conflict in order to resolves the El Sharara oil filed situation; with the 300k BPD field remaining closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (U/C) is little changed with the yellow metal hovering towards the middle of its daily range, mimicking the dollar which is largely uneventful ahead of today&rsquo;s testimony by Fed Chair Powell to the Senate Banking Committee at 15:00GMT. Elsewhere, spot Palladium rose above USD 1550/oz, with the metal hitting a new high of USD 1554.50/oz; following strike threat by South African mineworkers added to supply concerns.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling is the standout G10 outperformer ahead of the latest Brexit update from UK PM May amidst heightened speculation that she will bow to Cabinet pressure and pull a no deal scenario off the table and perhaps entertain an extension to the March 29 deadline if Parliament rejects the WA next month or next week. Buyers seem to be front running U-turns on the former if not both, with Cable breaching resistance around 1.3100, then circa 1.3150 (near the 50 WMA) and subsequently tripping stops at 1.3160 to 1.3195 at best, so far. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has retreated sharply towards 0.8615, and also filling sell orders that were reportedly sitting between 0.8625-20 on the way. BoE testimony to the TSC on February&rsquo;s QIR is now underway, but Brexit remains paramount and the PM is due to speak from 12.30GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major laggards on a mixture of tempered US-China related risk appetite and softer/stable crude prices after President Trump&rsquo;s latest bearish interjection. Aud/Usd has duly retreated from Monday&rsquo;s peaks having faded ahead of loftier highs reached last week and is back below 0.7150 where previous resistance at the 50 DMA (0.7134) may now provide some technical support. However, the Loonie has not been able to hold above 1.3200 vs its US rival and the Kiwi is hovering closer to the base of a 0.6872-88 range with hefty option expiry interest likely to cap the upside ahead of the NY cut (1.8 bn at the 0.6900 strike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All on a firmer footing vs the Greenback that is drifting lower with the index down to fresh, albeit marginal lows (DXY just shy of 96.300). Usd/Jpy has eased back from 111.00+ to a 110.76 low and the Franc has pared losses from parity+ again, while the single currency appears more intent on taking out chart hurdles that have been protecting a more pronounced approach towards 1.1400, like the 30 DMA at 1.1363. If broken, 1.1393 represents daily resistance and 1.1402 is a 50% Fib, while decent expiries lie from 1.1390-1.1400 (1.6 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note also, other large option expiries running off today include 2.4 bn in Eur/Usd between 1.1330-40, 1.8 bn in Nzd/Usd at 0.6900 and 2 bn in Eur/NOK at 9.8000 (vs current spot rate of 9.7800).</p>\r\n",

(Newswires) This is relatively in-fitting with reports via The Telegraph over the weekend that PM May is considering a Brexit delay of two months in a bid to avoid Cabinet resignations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to propose formally ruling out a no-deal Brexit which could postpone the Brexit date by months; according to The Sun. The article stated that the Premier is not ruling out a no-deal Brexit willingly, and to avoid total Brexiteer meltdown, PM still wants to keep the option of no-deal alive for later in the year after any extension to Article 50. Aides are said to be split over whether May should make the major concession directly when she addresses Parliament. Furthermore, key figures such as Environment Secretary Michael Gove are expected to back the PM&rsquo;s move. The Sun&rsquo;s Political Editor, Tom Newton Dunn tweeted that PM May is convinced that it&rsquo;s now the only way she can stop Remain ministers passing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, which is viewed in No10 as &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;. (The Sun/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many as 15 ministers could resign and vote for the Cooper-Letwin motion unless PM May provides assurances on a no-deal Brexit today; according to Daily Mail. Ministers include Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Secretary of State for Justice David Gauke, Business Secretary Greg Clark. Other Tories who are said to be close to resigning to stop a no-deal include Scottish Secretary David Mundell, Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, Solicitor General Robert Buckland and Disabilities Minister Sarah Newton. This comes after a group of 23 dissidents met secretly at the Commons last night to discuss how to stop a no-deal Brexit. (Daily Mail)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Opposition Labour Party are to put forward a People&#39;s Vote amendment this week. Furthermore, there were reports the party will back the Cooper-Letwin amendment to take No Deal Brexit off the table. The Cooper-Letwin amendment would force the government to hand power to parliament if no UK-EU withdrawal deal has been approved by March 13th. UK Labour spokesperson said the exact form of the amendment on the second referendum and timing are not yet clear, but Labour will not vote for anything that supports UK PM May&#39;s deal.

Finally, the INR weakened amidst the escalating tensions between Indian and Pakistan after an Indian aircraft reportedly violated Pakistani airspace, USD/INR opened around 71.2500 vs yesterday&rsquo;s close of 70.9850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures traded sideways throughout most of the Asia-Pac session following the significant decline sparked by US President Trump. WTI futures found some support at USD 55.00/bbl and Brent traded on either side of USD 64.50/bbl as the energy benchmarks await further catalysts amid a thinned news-flow environment. Elsewhere spot gold marginally benefitted from the mild risk-averse tone, although the market sentiment pressured copper as the red metal slipped from 8-month highs. Meanwhile, Dalian iron ore futures fell over 4.0%, hitting its lowest in over three weeks after Brazil&rsquo;s shipment of the base material increased in February vs. January, in turn easing supply worries which were sparked by the collapse of the Vale dam. Finally, spot palladium rose over USD 1550/oz as threats of strikes in South Africa&rsquo;s Mining Industry ignited supply fears. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Crown Prince Bin-Salman and Russian President Putin agreed that cooperation in the oil market is valuable and must continue; according to WSJ citing sources.

ASX 200 (-1.3%) extended losses from the open, with all sectors in the red and underperformance in material and oil names amid price action in energy and base metals. Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) failed to hold onto opening gains as safe-haven flows into the JPY pressured the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) is swinging between gains and losses following the prior day&rsquo;s 5% trade-induced rally, whilst Hang Seng (-0.4%) failed to nurse losses as the index is pressured by heavyweight oil names alongside shares in Apple supplier ACC Technologies, which tumbled over 12% following a profit warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY trades choppy within a relatively tight range ahead of Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony before the Banking Senate Committee. As such, EUR/USD trades sideways above 1.1350, whilst GBP/USD received a bout of demand in early Asia-Pac trade after reports that PM May is considering a plan to postpone Brexit, which she will discuss with her Cabinet tomorrow, ahead of a Parliamentary announcement. Elsewhere, AUD saw some marginal downside which coincided with reports that China skipped crude imports from the US for a second consecutive month, which may throw a spanner in the works in terms of trade amid an agreement to narrow US trade deficit. AUD/USD tested 0.7150 to the downside ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.7134. The mild risk-off sentiment also sent USD/JPY back below 111.00 to a low of 110.75 and subsequently, AUD/JPY lost the 79.500 handle.</p>\r\n",
