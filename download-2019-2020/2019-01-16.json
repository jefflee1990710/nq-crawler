Financial earnings continued today with Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) beating on both top and bottom line, seeing the two stocks lead the sector higher; U.S. Bancorp (USB) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) also beat estimates. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pushed higher with credit to a price target increase at Stifel, citing strong Macau region growth. First Data (FDC) surged on reports of Fiserv (FISV) acquiring it for USD 22bln; consequentially Fiserv was an underperformer. Nordstrom (JWN) nosedived on the open after it reported disappointing holiday period sales and lower guidance, other retailers Macy&rsquo;s (M) and Kohls (KSS) suffered in the fallout. PG&amp;E (PCG) continued its slide in the midst of its bankruptcy filing. Ford (F) underperformed following it lowering its Q4 guidance below expectations.

APAC volume was light and the range was narrow, and into the EU session, there was a downside bias after liquidation of 5yr call spreads, Informa reported, while lower Gilts were also influencing FI ahead of the confidence vote. There was some stabilisation towards the US open, though pressure in the long-end was seen, helping the curve steepen. After the UK confidence vote, where UK PM May survived, there was some selling of the T-Note, though it remained within the day&rsquo;s range. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, and generally +/- around 1bps. US T-note futures (H9) settled 6 ticks lower at 121-23.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities up, Treasuries down, crude up, dollar flat/up.<br />* REAR VIEW: May survives confidence vote; ECB&rsquo;s Mersch acknowledges slowdown; Fed&rsquo;s George warns against overtightening,<br />* AHEAD: SARB Interest Rate Decision, EU Final HICP, US Initial Jobless Claims &amp; Philly Fed Business Index, ECB&#39;s Lautenschlager Speaking, BoE&#39;s Carney Speaking, Fed&#39;s Quarles Speaking, G20 Finance Ministers &amp; Central Bank Deputies meeting in Tokyo.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>As was expected, UK Prime Minister May survived a motion of no confidence in her Government, winning the vote by 325-306. In her remarks after the vote, May again emphasised a cross-party approach to try and piece together a Brexit deal. However, her approach seems to face challenges: opposition Labour only want to work with her if she rules out a no deal Brexit, something which will take away some of her capacity in negotiations; the SNP are demanding a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats want Parliament to take charge &ndash; a combination of these factors presents hurdles to the PM. Additionally, some have noted that the DUP support was vital in her surviving the motion, which ITV&rsquo;s political editor has said gives the DUP &ldquo;power of life and death&rdquo; over here, and that if she wants to remain Prime Minister, she must persuade the EU27 to either drop or time-limit the Irish backstop, something which Ireland itself seems reticent to do. While the official position of the EU remains &lsquo;we have little else to offer&rsquo;, there are now frequent reports, citing sources, which suggest that the EU is ready to make further offers to the UK on the backstop, but the initiative should come from Ireland, Handelsblatt said; while the UK Times reported that the EU is looking at plans for a Brexit extension through 2020. More publicly, the Italians have struck a constructive tone, with Deputy PM Salvini suggesting more talks are likely to be held; however, that show of support is, perhaps unsurprisingly, not seen from France. In Germany, businesses are reportedly telling the German government to avoid a hard Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED BEIGE BOOK </strong>showed that economic activity expanded in most of the US, with eight of the twelve districts reporting modest-to-moderate growth; all noted tight labour markets at all skill levels. Many districts reported contacts had become less optimistic due to rising financial market volatility, rising short-term rates, falling energy prices and elevated trade and political uncertainty. Wages grew across the country, majority of districts citing moderate gains. Majority reported modest-to-moderate price increases; several cited higher tariffs as a factor. Chicago Fed reported the gov shutdown causing a slowdown of agricultural reports, creating uncertainty in the farming industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s George (Hawk, Voter) said that portfolio runoff could offer &quot;fair explanation&quot; for some of the recent market volatility; he believes the Fed should be more patient in raising rates to avoid overtightening and to extend the expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Mersch (Hawkish) echoed comments from ECB President Draghi who recently suggested there is a slowdown which is not heading towards a recession but could be longer than previously expected. She emphasized that the EZ slowdown is broadly in-line with expectations and fundamentals remain unchanged; she added that the slowdown was expected, no need to reconsider policy and the slowdown does not mean slipping into recession. ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawk) stated that Eurozone core inflation is stable but low. ECB&#39;s Villeroy stressed that policy normalisation must be gradual and pragmatic to keep all option open; added that they must &quot;actively&quot; prepare for a no deal Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s Governor Carney noted that the market view of Brexit vote is most clearly expressed in FX markets and added that the sterling rebound appears to reflect some expectation that the process of resolution would be extended, and the prospect of no-deal has diminished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G19) SETTLES $0.20 HIGHER AT $52.31/BBL; BRENT (H19) SETTLES $0.68 HIGHER AT $61.32/BBL.</strong> Crude was mixed for much of the day, with Brent trading higher on risk sentiment, while WTI was under pressure after the weekly inventory data. The DOE reported crude stocks drawing down more than expected: Headline crude stocks drew 2.7mln (exp. -1.3mln), Cushing stocks drew -0.7mln; gasoline saw a build of 7.5mln (exp +2.8mln) while distillate built by 2.9mln (exp. 1.6mln). However, WTI traded off the production levels, which rose to 11.9mln BPD. In news, Libya&#39;s Waha field cut production by 88k as a result of the port closure, PVM reported. In broker talk, Goldman Sachs researchers forecast Brent prices between USD 60-65/bbl in 2019-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.2% at 2616, NDX -0.0% at 6669, DJI +0.6% at 24203.</strong> SECTORS: Energy -0.1%, Materials +0.4%, Industrials +0.1%, Cons Discretionary -0.1%, Cons Staples -0.5%, Healthcare -0.1%, Financials +2.3%, Tech +0.1%, Telecoms -0.4%, Utilities +0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>United Continental (UAL) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 following a strong earnings report. Financial earnings continued today with Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) beating on both top and bottom line, seeing the two stocks lead the sector higher; U.S. Bancorp (USB) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) also beat estimates. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pushed higher with credit to a price target increase at Stifel, citing strong Macau region growth. First Data (FDC) surged on reports of Fiserv (FISV) acquiring it for USD 22bln; consequentially Fiserv was an underperformer. Nordstrom (JWN) nosedived on the open after it reported disappointing holiday period sales and lower guidance, other retailers Macy&rsquo;s (M) and Kohls (KSS) suffered in the fallout. PG&amp;E (PCG) continued its slide in the midst of its bankruptcy filing. Ford (F) underperformed following it lowering its Q4 guidance below expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 6 TICKS LOWER AT 121-23. </strong>A more constructive risk tone saw Treasuries sold on Wednesday. APAC volume was light and the range was narrow, and into the EU session, there was a downside bias after liquidation of 5yr call spreads, Informa reported, while lower Gilts were also influencing FI ahead of the confidence vote. There was some stabilisation towards the US open, though pressure in the long-end was seen, helping the curve steepen. After the UK confidence vote, where UK PM May survived, there was some selling of the T-Note, though it remained within the day&rsquo;s range. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, and generally +/- around 1bps. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Still ahead of the game and just above 96.000 in what has been another day of advances for the index, marching to highs of 96.180 and not far from yesterday&rsquo;s 96.270 peak. DXY took out its 100 DMA to the upside at 96.030 ahead of its 50 DMA at 96.639, shy of the 2019 peak of 96.960. The rising greenback comes amid the continued lack of progress between US and China in key sticking points such as IP. Meanwhile, more data delays State-side as the US government shutdown drags further into the new year as President Trump and the Democratic House of Representatives remain at an impasse. ING highlights that the impact of the shutdown on the broader US economy will be modest but noticeable as the 800k federal government workers represent just 0.5% of the 150mln people on the US non-farm payroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The Pound held onto most of yesterday&rsquo;s vote-induced gains and remains in close proximity to its 100 DMA at 1.2893 ahead of the psychological 1.2900 level. Sterling largely shrugged off the release of December inflation figure which largely printed in-line with forecasts, though the currency received impetus from a Handelsblatt article which stated that the EU are reportedly ready to make further concessions, but the initiative should come from Ireland. Thus, Cable immediate spiked higher from 1.2845 to hit resistance at 1.2890 before paring back a bulk of the move as the EU&rsquo;s offer came with a condition of a free trade agreement by the end of 2022 at the latest to avoid NI remaining in the European single market. GBP then felt another boost as Italian Deputy PM Salvini stated that further Brexit talks with Britain are likely, and as such GBP/USD revisited resistance at 1.2890 but failed to breach the level to the upside. Looking ahead, PM May&rsquo;s no confidence vote, tabled by opposition leader Corbyn, will take place at 1900GMT, though the Premier is almost certainly expected to win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, JPY: </strong>Again, a lack of catalysts and a rising dollar has put the single currency on the backfoot. EUR/USD receded further below 1.1450 and dipped below 1.1400 at one point to print session lows of 1.1378 while testing its 50 DMA around 1.1380. Meanwhile, the Yen suffered a similar fate as the Japanese currency erased overnight safe-haven led gains as USD/JPY climbed further above 108.00 to levels just shy of 109.00 with an intraday range of 108.37-90. Furthermore, BoJ sources noted that the Central Bank will cut inflation forecasts at the next meeting, though this was in-fitting with a Nikkei article published at the start of the year. Moving onto the Franc, the stronger buck and unwind in risk-premium weighed on the Swiss currency as USD/CHF tested resistance at 0.9910 (vs an intraday low of 0.9873) as the pair took out its 100 and 200 DMAs to the upside at 0.9879 and 0.9891.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>The antipodeans remain the standout underperformers as a decline in base metals as the buck weighed on the currencies with AUD/USD sitting firmly below 0.7200 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.7177 while NZD/USD fell further below 0.6800 to test support at 0.6755 before hitting resistance at its 200 HMA at 0.6782. Conversely, the Loonie is poised to post another day of gains with upside exacerbated by the rising oil prices as WTI reclaimed the USD 52/bbl handle (before US inventory data), albeit upside has been capped by the firmer greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The EM outperformer as USD/TRY extends losses 5.4000 (vs. high of 5.4510) The Turkish Central Bank left rates unchanged at with their main rate at 24.00% while largely reiterating its tight bias, stating that the CB are to further monetary policy tightening will be delivered if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>SARB Interest Rate Decision due on January 17th at 1300GMT/0700ET. Consensus looks for rates to be held unchanged at 6.75%. At the previous meeting in November, the central bank lifted rates by 25bps &ndash; the decision was a split 3 vs 3 decision for hike/hold respectively, with the Governor Kganyago casting the deciding vote. Looking ahead, the Governor stated that the implied path until end of 2020 shows 3 more 25bps hikes to 7.5%. Focus has been, and remains on, risks to their inflation outlook, with analysts expecting that January data will register a decline on December levels of 5.2%. A figure which is still towards the top end of their 3-6% targeted inflation range may provide impetus for a hike to combat inflationary pressure. Analysts at Credit Suisse see scope for at least one more 25bps hike this year. However, with Brent prices around USD 60/bbl, significantly below the SARB 2019 average forecast of USD 73/bbl, current prices are likely to be a factor supporting an on-hold decision. Focus at the meeting will be on any change to the risks surrounding inflation outlook, in particular, what the impact of the recent oil price slide will be on the SARB&rsquo;s policy function, alongside the subsequent implications for the rate trajectory. The upcoming South Africa General Election is likely to weigh on the monetary policy committee as a potential risk; currently the incumbent Cyril Ramaphosa is ahead, with ANC party support polling at 61%, according to Ipsos.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Still ahead of the game and just above 96.000 in what has been another day of advances for the index, marching to highs of 96.180 and not far from yesterday&rsquo;s 96.270 peak. DXY took out its 100 DMA to the upside at 96.030 ahead of its 50 DMA at 96.639, shy of the 2019 peak of 96.960. The rising greenback comes amid the continued lack of progress between US and China in key sticking points such as IP. Meanwhile, more data delays State-side as the US government shutdown drags further into the new year as President Trump and the Democratic House of Representatives remain at an impasse. ING highlights that the impact of the shutdown on the broader US economy will be modest but noticeable as the 800k federal government workers represent just 0.5% of the 150mln people on the US non-farm payroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong>&ndash; The Pound held onto most of yesterday&rsquo;s vote-induced gains and remains in close proximity to its 100 DMA at 1.2893 ahead of the psychological 1.2900 level. Sterling largely shrugged off the release of December inflation figure which largely printed in-line with forecasts, though the currency received impetus from a Handelsblatt article which stated that the EU are reportedly ready to make further concessions, but the initiative should come from Ireland. Thus, Cable immediate spiked higher from 1.2845 to hit resistance at 1.2890 before paring back a bulk of the move as the EU&rsquo;s offer came with a condition of a free trade agreement by the end of 2022 at the latest to avoid NI remaining in the European single market. GBP then felt another boost as Italian Deputy PM Salvini stated that further Brexit talks with Britain are likely, and as such GBP/USD revisited resistance at 1.2890 but failed to breach the level to the upside. Looking ahead, PM May&rsquo;s no confidence vote, tabled by opposition leader Corbyn, will take place at 1900GMT, though the Premier is almost certainly expected to win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR, JPY</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Again, a lack of catalysts and a rising dollar has put the single currency on the backfoot. EUR/USD receded further below 1.1450 and dipped below 1.1400 at one point to print session lows of 1.1378 while testing its 50 DMA around 1.1380. Meanwhile, the Yen suffered a similar fate as the Japanese currency erased overnight safe-haven led gains as USD/JPY climbed further above 108.00 to levels just shy of 109.00 with an intraday range of 108.37-90. Furthermore, BoJ sources noted that the Central Bank will cut inflation forecasts at the next meeting, though this was in-fitting with a Nikkei article published at the start of the year. Moving onto the Franc, the stronger buck and unwind in risk-premium weighed on the Swiss currency as USD/CHF tested resistance at 0.9910 (vs an intraday low of 0.9873) as the pair took out its 100 and 200 DMAs to the upside at 0.9879 and 0.9891.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong> &ndash; The antipodeans remain the standout underperformers as a decline in base metals as the buck weighed on the currencies with AUD/USD sitting firmly below 0.7200 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.7177 while NZD/USD fell further below 0.6800 to test support at 0.6755 before hitting resistance at its 200 HMA at 0.6782. Conversely, the Loonie is poised to post another day of gains with upside exacerbated by the rising oil prices as WTI reclaimed the USD 52/bbl handle (before US inventory data), albeit upside has been capped by the firmer greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRY </strong>&ndash; The EM outperformer as USD/TRY extends losses 5.4000 (vs. high of 5.4510) The Turkish Central Bank left rates unchanged at with their main rate at 24.00% while largely reiterating its tight bias, stating that the CB are to further monetary policy tightening will be delivered if needed.</p>\r\n",

Traders now look ahead to the upcoming vote of no confidence in PM May (7pm GMT), which looks set to fail, alongside a bill to be presented by UK lawmaker Grieve to place another referendum on the table. German 10-year futures are the next-worst performer in Europe and have essentially been unchanged since the morning, with losses still in the 30-tick area. Italian/German 10-year yield spreads have tightened by 10bps to 254bps as Italian 10-year futures continue their climb; they have found a solid base above the 127.50 mark and trade with gains of over 80 ticks. Traders in Europe now look ahead to further ECB speak from Villeroy who earlier said the &#39;Yellow Vest&#39; protests will deliver &quot;significant short-term consequences&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the US curve is seeing some steepening in the longer end as the bearish impulses in futures persist. &nbsp;10-yr futures have been stable around the 122-22 area, with traders mindful of any shutdown updates following suggestions that some Democrats are expected to take part in White House meeting. Looking ahead Fed speak is set to occur from Kashkari, who is expected to reiterate the Fed&rsquo;s dovish tilt, with the NAHB Housing index and Fed&rsquo;s beige book also set to be released.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) finished positive as gains in tech and financials eventually outweighed the weakness across the commodity-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) suffered the fallout from a firmer currency. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) conformed to the indecisive tone but with the mainland kept afloat for most the session after stronger than expected Loans and Aggregate Financing data, while the PBoC also conducted its largest ever daily net liquidity injection heading into next month&rsquo;s Chinese New Year celebrations in which it cited rapidly falling liquidity due to tax payments.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are mixed after trimming opening gains [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.1%] with outperformance seen in the FTSE MIB (+0.5%) where banking names are up, in particular UniCredit (+2.6%) at the top of the index following the Co. stating they consider their NPE coverage to be fully adequate. Sectors are largely in the green, with financial names outperforming; in particular the Stoxx 600 Banking sector is up by over 1% as some are interpreting the governments Brexit defeat as reducing the likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU. Other notable movers include Hammerson (+1.7%) after being upgraded at Deutsche Bank and Ryanair (+2.1%) who are up in sympathy following United Continental Holdings posting a beat on their top and bottom line overnight; were subsequently up 6% after-market. Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank (+1.7%) and Commerzbank (+1.5%) are up following reports that German officials have spoken to watchdogs regarding a potential deal between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Little changed following last night&rsquo;s advances in which the index attempted, but failed to breach 96.000 to the upside, while it creeps closer to the top of a 95.850-96.080 range.&nbsp; Impetus for the buck was initially provided following yesterday&rsquo;s comments from US Senator Grassley who cited USTR Lighthizer as US-China talks showed little progress in key issues. The dollar then came off highs as Fed hawk (and voter) George noted that it might be a good time to pause on rate hikes. Subsequently DXY fell to around 95.850 amid the Fed member&rsquo;s shift in stance before recouping losses. In terms of technical DXY eyes its 100 DMA at 96.03 to the upside, though looking ahead, US retail sales have been postponed amid the ongoing US government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The calm after the storm as PM May&rsquo;s deal was defeated by a historical 230 votes shortly before Labour leader Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence (as expected), scheduled for 1900GMT today. The move higher came amid hopes that Article 50 will be extended past March 29th as PM May will attempt to conjure up a revised deal with the EU or face a hard-Brexit which is unfavoured by most UK MPs. However, the EU made it clear that renegotiations will not be open, while Commons leader Leadsom mentioned that the UK Government is not looking to postpone the Brexit date ahead of tonight&rsquo;s vote of no confidence. The Pound was largely unreactive to Corbyn&rsquo;s no confidence motion as the Conservative party and the DUP (alongside some Labour MPs) are likely to support the Government rather than amplify the chaos in Parliament. Moving on, on the data front, Sterling side-line the release of inflation figures which largely printed in-line with expectations. Cable currently resides just below 1.2900, just above its 100 HMA at 1.2857 after having tested the big figure to the upside on multiple occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, JPY- Meanwhile, the EUR is relatively flat against the buck as a lack of fresh catalysts (and all eyes on Brexit) largely shelved the single currency as it moves in tandem to the greenback. EUR/USD further extends losses below 1.1450 and fluctuates on either side of the 1.1400 level ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.1380. Of note, 950mln in options expiries are seen at strike 1.1380-1.1400. Similarly, with the Yen overnight safe-haven driven gains were largely neutralised by the strengthening dollar as USD/JPY rises to the top of a 108.38-73 range with almost 1.7bln in option expiries scattered between 108.75-109.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The marked underperformers amid a rising buck and a decline in base metal prices, Kiwi declines to a slightly greater extent compared to its antipodean counterpart as NZD/USD falls below its 50 and 200 DMA at 0.6795 before the pair found some support at its 200 HMA at 0.6780. Back to the Aussie, AUD/USD fell through the psychological 0.72000 and its 50 DMA at 0.7192 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.7177.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY &ndash; The Turkish Central Bank left rates unchanged at with their main rate at 24.00% while largely reiterating its tight stance, stating that the CB are to further monetary policy tightening will be delivered if needed. As such USD/TRY fell from 5.4134 to an intraday low of 5.3800 before pairing back a third of the move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU and UK debt has kicked off the day in the red and Gilts are bearing the brunt of the heaviest Governmental defeat in UK history over the Brexit deal, with 10-year UK futures leading losses in the fixed income scope as the perceived likelihood of no Brexit, or a softer exit, increase. The benchmark is languishing firmly under the 123.00 handle with the next hurdle to overcome the Parliamentary vote of no-confidence that was tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn last night. This is set to be voted on at 7:00pm GMT with expectations set on a loss for the Labour leader (due to DUP and members of the ERG have sounding out support for the Government) with all options, including a 2nd referendum, on the table should it fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK CPI release, which came in essentially in line with expectations, failed to have an impact on Gilts as focus remains firmly set on the political fallout of the meaningful vote and whether UK PM May can bring back a more &ldquo;palatable&rdquo; deal on Monday amidst assertions from the EU that they are not willing to negotiate further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10-year Bund futures outperform their UK counterparts but are still comfortably in the red, with the German 10-year trading with losses of around 40 ticks after yesterday&rsquo;s comments from ECB President Draghi (reiterating the ECB line that the region is slowing but not in a downturn). In the periphery, BTPs are outperforming their EU and UK counterparts with Italian 10-year futures firmly in the green and slowly tracking higher since the open. Futures remain in close proximity to session highs of 127.21, with the Jan 2nd low of 127.52 next up as resistance as traders look ahead for further potential comments from Villeroy (who said that the &#39;Yellow Vest&#39; protests will deliver &quot;significant short-term consequences&quot;) later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (-0.5%) are drifting further into negative territory, with WTI losing the USD 52.00/bbl handle. As the positive market sentiment following yesterday&rsquo;s 0.560mln draw in API crude inventories begins to fade; despite a 3% rally in the previous session on the back of this. Elsewhere, ARA region crude inventories rose 2.4mln/bbl to 51.3mln/bbl for the week ending January 11th. Markets will be looking ahead to today&rsquo;s weekly EIA release, where crude stocks are expected to post a draw of 1.5mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.1%) is relatively flat, but towards the bottom of it&rsquo;s slim USD 4/oz range; as the dollar remains relatively uneventful and FX market reaction to the Brexit vote defeat is largely positive as the prospect of a no-deal has lessened. Separately, the US Senate has voted to advance a resolution which criticises sanctions on companies tied to Oleg Deripaska, which includes Rusal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Move to block Trump administration from lifting sanctions on Rusal (468 HK) and other companies linked to Deripaska has passed first hurdle in US Senate.

Sectors are largely in the green, with financial names outperforming; in particular the Stoxx 600 Banking sector is up by over 1% as some are interpreting the governments Brexit defeat as reducing the likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU. Other notable movers include Hammerson (+2.1%) after being upgraded at Deutsche Bank and Ryanair (+2.4%) who are up in sympathy following United Continental Holdings posting a beat on their top and bottom line overnight; were subsequently up 6% after-market. Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank (+2.0%) and Commerzbank (+1.8%) are up following reports that German officials have spoken to watchdogs regarding a potential deal between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Little changed following last night&rsquo;s advances in which the index attempted, but failed to breach 96.000 to the upside, while it creeps closer to the top of a 95.850-96.000 range.&nbsp; Impetus for the buck was initially provided following yesterday&rsquo;s comments from US Senator Grassley who cited USTR Lighthizer as US-China talks showed little progress in key issues. The dollar then came off highs as Fed hawk (and voter) George noted that it might be a good time to pause on rate hikes. Subsequently DXY fell to around 95.850 amid the Fed member&rsquo;s shift in stance before recouping losses. In terms of technical DXY eyes its 100 DMA at 96.03 to the upside, though looking ahead, US retail sales have been postponed amid the ongoing US government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The calm after the storm as PM May&rsquo;s deal was defeated by a historical 230 votes shortly before Labour leader Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence (as expected), scheduled for 1900GMT today. The move higher came amid hopes that Article 50 will be extended past March 29th as PM May will attempt to conjure up a revised deal with the EU or face a hard-Brexit which is unfavoured by most UK MPs. However, the EU made it clear that renegotiations will not be open, while Commons leader Leadsom mentioned that the UK Government is not looking to postpone the Brexit date ahead of tonight&rsquo;s vote of no confidence. The Pound was largely unreactive to Corbyn&rsquo;s no confidence motion as the Conservative party and the DUP (alongside some Labour MPs) are likely to support the Government rather than amplify the chaos in Parliament. Moving on, on the data front, Sterling side-line the release of inflation figures which largely printed in-line with expectations. Cable currently resides just below 1.2900, just above its 100 HMA at 1.2857 after having tested the big figure to the upside on multiple occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, JPY- Meanwhile, the EUR is relatively flat against the buck as a lack of fresh catalysts (and all eyes on Brexit) largely shelved the single currency as it moves in tandem to the greenback. EUR/USD further extends losses below 1.1450 and fluctuates on either side of the 1.1400 level ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.1380. Of note, 950mln in options expiries are seen at strike 1.1380-1.1400. Similarly, with the Yen overnight safe-haven driven gains were largely neutralised by the strengthening dollar as USD/JPY rises to the top of a 108.38-73 range with almost 1.7bln in option expiries scattered between 108.75-109.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The marked underperformers amid a rising buck and a decline in base metal prices, Kiwi declines to a slightly greater extent compared to its antipodean counterpart as NZD/USD falls below its 50 and 200 DMA at 0.6795 before the pair found some support at its 200 HMA at 0.6780. Back to the Aussie, AUD/USD fell through the psychological 0.72000 and its 50 DMA at 0.7192 ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.7177.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU and UK debt has kicked off the day in the red and Gilts are bearing the brunt of the heaviest Governmental defeat in UK history over the Brexit deal, with 10-year UK futures leading losses in the fixed income scope as the perceived likelihood of no Brexit, or a softer exit, increase. The benchmark is languishing firmly under the 123.00 handle with the next hurdle to overcome the Parliamentary vote of no-confidence that was tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn last night. This is set to be voted on at 7:00pm GMT with expectations set on a loss for the Labour leader (due to DUP and members of the ERG have sounding out support for the Government) with all options, including a 2nd referendum, on the table should it fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK CPI release, which came in essentially in line with expectations, failed to have an impact on Gilts as focus remains firmly set on the political fallout of the meaningful vote and whether UK PM May can bring back a more &ldquo;palatable&rdquo; deal on Monday amidst assertions from the EU that they are not willing to negotiate further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10-year Bund futures outperform their UK counterparts but are still comfortably in the red, with the German 10-year trading with losses of around 40 ticks after yesterday&rsquo;s comments from ECB President Draghi (reiterating the ECB line that the region is slowing but not in a downturn). In the periphery, BTPs are outperforming their EU and UK counterparts with Italian 10-year futures firmly in the green and slowly tracking higher since the open. Futures remain in close proximity to session highs of 127.21, with the Jan 2nd low of 127.52 next up as resistance as traders look ahead for further potential comments from Villeroy (who said that the &#39;Yellow Vest&#39; protests will deliver &quot;significant short-term consequences&quot;) later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to US Treasuries, futures are lower across the curve with the longer end seeing the majority of the action after the failed Brexit deal fallout and Fed&rsquo;s George softened her stance to fall in line with the recent Dovish rhetoric, with Kashkari set to speak later in the day. Potential risk events to look out for throughout Wednesday&rsquo;s session also lie with US-China trade and the US Government shutdown in a data-thin session that brings us the NAHB Housing Index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (-0.4%) are drifting into negative territory, with WTI losing the USD 52.00/bbl handle. As the positive market sentiment following yesterday&rsquo;s 0.560mln draw in API crude inventories begins to fade; despite a 3% rally in the previous session on the back of this. Elsewhere, ARA region crude inventories rose 2.4mln/bbl to 51.3mln/bbl for the week ending January 11th. Markets will be looking ahead to today&rsquo;s weekly EIA release, where crude stocks are expected to post a draw of 1.5mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) is relatively flat, but towards the bottom of it&rsquo;s slim USD 4/oz range; as the dollar remains relatively uneventful and FX market reaction to the Brexit vote defeat is largely positive as the prospect of a no-deal has lessened. Separately, the US Senate has voted to advance a resolution which criticises sanctions on companies tied to Oleg Deripaska, which includes Rusal.</p>\r\n",

The benchmark is languishing firmly under the 123.00 handle with the next hurdle to overcome the Parliamentary vote of no-confidence that was tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn last night. This is set to be voted on at 7:00pm GMT with expectations set on a loss for the Labour leader (due to DUP and members of the ERG have sounding out support for the Government) with all options, including a 2nd referendum, on the table should it fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK CPI release, which came in essentially in line with expectations, failed to have an impact on Gilts as focus remains firmly set on the political fallout of the meaningful vote and whether UK PM May can bring back a more &ldquo;palatable&rdquo; deal on Monday amidst assertions from the EU that they are not willing to negotiate further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10-year Bund futures outperform their UK counterparts but are still comfortably in the red, with the German 10-year trading with losses of around 30 ticks after yesterday&rsquo;s comments from ECB President Draghi (reiterating the ECB line that the region is slowing but not in a downturn) and ahead of supply in the form of Germany&rsquo;s EUR 1.5bln 1.25% 2048 Bund auction. In the periphery, BTPs are outperforming their EU and UK counterparts with Italian 10-year futures firmly in the green and slowly tracking higher since the open. Futures remain in close proximity to session highs of 127.21, with the Jan 2nd low of 127.52 next up as resistance as traders look forward a speech from ECBs Stournaras ahead of further potential comments from Villeroy (who said that the &#39;Yellow Vest&#39; protests will deliver &quot;significant short-term consequences&quot;) later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to US Treasuries, futures are lower across the curve with the longer end seeing the majority of the action after the failed Brexit deal fallout and Fed&rsquo;s George softened her stance to fall in line with the recent Dovish rhetoric, with Kashkari set to speak later in the day. Potential risk events to look out for throughout Wednesday&rsquo;s session also lie with US-China trade and the US Government shutdown in a data-thin session that brings us the NAHB Housing Index.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) finished positive as gains in tech and financials eventually outweighed the weakness across the commodity-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) suffered the fallout from a firmer currency. Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) conformed to the indecisive tone but with the mainland kept afloat for most the session after stronger than expected Loans and Aggregate Financing data, while the PBoC also conducted its largest ever daily net liquidity injection heading into next month&rsquo;s Chinese New Year celebrations in which it cited rapidly falling liquidity due to tax payments. Finally, 10yr JGBs eked only minimal gains despite the underperformance of riskier assets in Japan and firmer results in the latest 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 350bln via 7-day and CNY 220bln via 28-day reverse repos for a CNY 560bln net daily injection. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7615 (Prev. 6.7542)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom said will further boost consumption this year and that trade talks with US are among top priorities for this year, while there were also comments from Assistant Commerce Minister Ren that foreign trade faces increasing uncertainties this year but added that China will actively expand imports this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese House Prices (Dec) Y/Y 9.7% (Prev. 9.3%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal was defeated by 230 votes (432 vs. 202) in Parliament. UK PM May spoke following the defeat that the house has spoken and the government will listen, although added that the vote shows nothing about what parliament supports and that she does not know if the house intends to honour the referendum decision. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Leader of the opposition Labour party Corbyn called for a vote of no confidence in the government and a Labour Party spokesperson said if not able to get a general election, all options are on the table including a 2nd referendum. Sky Deputy Political Editor said up to 100 Labour MPs will pivot towards a second referendum this morning. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Government ministers told business leaders that there is a backbench motion being prepared to delay Article 50 (possibility raised by Chancellor Hammond) and said the no confidence motion will fail. In related news, a BBC Political Correspondent said DUP will be backing PM May in the no confidence vote, while Former Foreign Minister Johnson also said he will back PM May in a no-confidence vote. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU27 urged UK Government to clarify its intentions on its next steps as soon as possible and EU will continue EU&#39;s process of ratification of the agreement reached with the UK on Brexit according to a spokesperson. In related news, a WELT correspondent tweeted that several EU sources confirmed that EU27 would be ready to extend Article 50 until end of June, while there were separate reports that EU officials said no special summit is planned and Brexit deal not open for renegotiation. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There had been reports prior to the vote that the EU is planning to make clear it won&rsquo;t change its position if UK PM May&#39;s Brexit deal was rejected by MPs, while there were also separate reports that UK PM May is said to bring back a more &quot;palatable&quot; Brexit deal next week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Visa December consumer spending fell 1.0% Y/Y vs. 0.7% decline in November; largest drop since April. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />ECB&#39;s Draghi said present stance is very accommodative already and that snapshot still shows consumption and investment is expanding, while he added exports are less so but still good. Furthermore, Draghi suggested there is a slowdown which is not heading towards a recession but could be longer than previously expected. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was uneventful and traded around the 96.00 level as all focus centred on GBP/USD amid UK PM May&rsquo;s historic defeat, in which Parliament voted against her Brexit deal by the largest ever margin of 230 votes. This ultimately lifted GBP/USD off its lows and from support at the 1.2700 level with as participants found solace from hopes for an extension of Article 50 and likelihood the opposition Labour party&rsquo;s no confidence attempt will fail but ultimately, potentially lead to a softer Brexit. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies were choppy amid the indecisive sentiment, while JPY saw a bout of safe-haven flows amid underperformance of stocks in Japan.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities mostly traded uneventful in which WTI crude futures took a breather overnight above the USD 52.00/bbl level following the prior day&rsquo;s near-3% rally, with a narrower that expected draw in headline API crude inventories doing little to dent the recent firm gains. Elsewhere, gold was flat amid a lacklustre greenback and copper prices were higher despite the indecisive risk tone, but with price action contained within the recent weeks&rsquo; tight range.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (11 Jan) -0.560mln vs. Exp. -1.3mln (prev. -6.127mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US EIA increases forecasts for 2019 world oil demand growth by 20,000 BPD to 1.54mln BPD and sees 2020 world oil demand to hit 103.07mln which would be up by 1.53mln BPD from 2019.

(Newswires/CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Move to block Trump administration from lifting sanctions on Rusal (468 HK) and other companies linked to Deripaska has passed first hurdle in US Senate.

The complex remained unreactive to worse than expected Fed Manufacturing and PPI data as well as cautious comments from ECB&rsquo;s President Draghi on the economy. Yields turned negative as Parliament begun to vote on PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal where PM May suffered the biggest defeat since 1920. Treasuries however pared back gains heading into the close and ended Tuesday&rsquo;s session on the unchanged mark. SPX +1.07% at 2610, NDX +1.97% at 6670, DJI +0.65% at 24065.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed discount rate minutes showed half of the Fed&#39;s 12 regional banks voted to leave the discount rate unchanged in December. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s George (Voter, Hawk) said it might be a good time to pause on rate hikes as should be patient and that rates are not yet at neutral but are close to it. George also commented that the rate-setting panel will be data dependent in their meeting in two weeks and that the Fed always has to be ready to pivot. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Dove) said global growth is decelerating and US economy faces risks from global growth, weakness in interest sensitive industries as well as tightening financial conditions. Kaplan also repeated that due to many risks, Fed would be &quot;wise&quot; to hold off on further policy action but added that he doesn&#39;t mean the Fed should halt hikes altogether. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove) said there is no need to tap the brakes on economy as long as inflation is low. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Vice President Pence said President Trump is standing firm for border security and that Democrats are not negotiating. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) finished positive as gains in tech and financials eventually outweighed the weakness across the commodity-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) suffered the fallout from a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) conformed to the indecisive tone but with the mainland kept afloat for most the session after stronger than expected Loans and Aggregate Financing data, while the PBoC also conducted its largest ever daily net liquidity injection heading into next month&rsquo;s Chinese New Year celebrations in which it cited rapidly falling liquidity due to tax payments. Finally, 10yr JGBs eked only minimal gains despite the underperformance of riskier assets in Japan and firmer results in the latest 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with the region struggling for firm direction after the tech-led gains on Wall St. and PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal defeat in parliament. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is marginally positive as gains in tech and financials just about outweighs the weakness across the commodity-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) suffers the fallout from a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) conform to the varied tone but with the mainland kept afloat after stronger than expected Loans and Aggregate Financing data, while the PBoC also conducted its largest ever daily net liquidity injection heading into next month&rsquo;s Chinese New Year celebrations and cited rapidly falling liquidity due to tax payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is uneventful and trades around the 96.00 level as all focus centred on GBP/USD amid UK PM May&rsquo;s historical defeat, in which Parliament voted against her Brexit deal by the largest ever margin of 230 votes. This ultimately lifted GBP/USD off its lows and support at the 1.2700 level with &ldquo;sell the rumour, buy the news&rdquo; at play as the rejection of the deal was widely anticipated and priced in heading into the vote, while participants also found solace from hopes for an extension of Article 50 and likelihood the opposition Labour party&rsquo;s no confidence attempts will fail. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies are choppy amid the indecisive sentiment, while JPY sees a bout of safe-haven flows amid underperformance of stocks in Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs have eked only minimal gains despite the underperformance of riskier assets in Japan, with participants sidelined ahead of a 5yr auction today.</p>\r\n",
