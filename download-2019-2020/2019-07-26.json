Of Michigan (F).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>A stellar earnings report from tech giant Google (GOOGL) saw major US equity indices reaching fresh all-time highs to end the week; Amazon’s (AMZN) earnings failed to follow suit however. In the FX space, dollar was firmer amid reports that Trump had shown resistance to US intervention to weaken the dollar, in addition to a slightly firmer than expected Q2 GDP figure (2.1%), which affirmed expectations of a 25bps cut at the FOMC next week.</p><p><strong>* US Q2 GDP:</strong> US GDP growth for Q2 came in at 2.1%, above consensus estimates for 1.8%. The prior reading, of 3.1% in Q1, remained unrevised. The core PCE deflator was 1.8%, below consensus for 2.0%, and the GDP deflator printed at 2.4%, higher than consensus for 2.0% (and the prior 1.1%). Growth in H1 19 averaged 2.6%, Pantheon note, above the 5-year average, despite the diminishing fiscal boost from 2018’s tax cuts. Consumer spending rebounded from Q1’s sluggish 1.1% to grow at 4.3% in Q2 and government spending went up 5%; offsetting negative contributions from in business fixed investment, trade and inventories. Pantheon expect both consumption growth and soft business investment to mean revert in H2 and forecast Q3 GDP at between 2-2.5%. On the weak core PCE deflator print, Pantheon suggest it implies either downward revisions to April, May and/or a very soft June reading relative to the core CPI; with the former seeming more likely. As desks have noted, Friday’s GDP data is unlikely to have an impact on the Fed’s rate decision, especially given that the inflation and business investment metrics (two areas the Fed has expressed concern about) were underwhelming. The market is almost unanimous in its expectations for a cut next week, widely expected to be of 25bps and Fed fund futures currently price a further 65bps worth of easing by year end. However, Pantheon note that “the more data we see, the more that one-and-done makes much more sense than continued easing.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The US is to push the WTO to end its lenient treatment of China and other nations; US President Trump reportedly told USTR Lighthizer to “use all available means” to get the WTO to prevent countries from claiming developing country status if their economic strength means they don’t need beneficial treatment, naming China, Kuwait, Qatar, Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, Mexico, South Korea, Turkey, Macao &amp; Brunei as culprits. Trump is reportedly threatening that if the WTO does not make \"substantial\" progress within 50 days, the US will no longer treat certain countries as developing economies and will not support membership of these countries within the OECD. Trump also hit out at France for their planned digital revenues tax, that would disproportionately hit US tech giants; he said \"France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly.\" White House officials followed up on Trump’s criticisms, adding that the French digital tax shows a lack of commitment to the current OECD negotiations and confirmed that the White House is looking at all policy tools in addition to the already launched trade investigation in response to the French tax. Elsewhere, there were reports that the US is looking to intervene to help resolve trade tensions between South Korea and Japan, confirming earlier Trump tweets in which he had expressed an interest in helping to mediate.</p><p><strong>*USD INTERVENTION: </strong>US President Trump rejected plans to devalue the dollar after Trade Adviser Navarro set forth the ideas in a US-China trade dispute meeting, the ideas were briefly dismissed as soon as Navarro begun the presentation, Politico reported. Earlier, NEC Director Kudlow stated he would not agree that Trump wants a weak dollar, instead he is concerned about other countries devaluing their currencies and that the US has ruled out any currency intervention. It was then reported, before the Politico report, that a meeting related to the issue had been held in the White House, where methods discussed included capital controls and active Jawboning by US officials on TV.</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>North Korea leader Kim Jong-un said that the missile firings were a warning to South Korea's warmongers; coming after he said that South Korea has been bringing in weapons for an attack, adding that North Korea must keep developing weapons to eliminate national security threats. US Secretary of State Pompeo said he expects talks with North Korea to resume in the approaching few weeks.</p><p><strong>* ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF): </strong>Forecasters cut CPI expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021 by 1bp to 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. 2019 GDP expectations remained at 1.2% along with 2021 forecasts of 1.4%, however forecasters cut 2020 GDP expectations to 1.3% from 1.4%.</p><p><strong>* CBR REVIEW:</strong> The CBR cut rates by 25bps, as was widely expected, to 7.25%. Guidance was left unchanged, but Goldman Sachs observes some dovish tweaks. “The guidance indicates that the CBR might cut rates in one of the upcoming meetings and that it might move to neutral rates by mid-2020,” the bank says, “previous communications indicate that the CBR estimates neutral around 6-7%.” Goldman says it sees rates falling to 6.5% by the end of this year, reaching the lower bound of the CBR’s estimate of neutral by mid-2020, and also argues that it could be cut further to 5.5% by the end of 2021. “Our more dovish forecast than current CBR guidance owes to the fact that we expect inflation to fall below 3.5% by Q1 2019, and hence significantly below the CBR’s view that inflation will fall to its target of 4% by early next year,” and adds that “furthermore, we estimate the neutral rate at 5.5%, i.e. lower than the CBR.”</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 2 TICKS LOWER AT 127-07:</strong> The T-plex traded sideways and a little choppy to end the week, seemingly unphased by the GDP data or by Trump dismissing the use of dollar intervention. The US Q2 GDP saw very mild selling 2.1% (exp. 1.8%), but analysts note algos, CTAs, and real money bought the dip. NEC Director Kudlow announcing Trump’s opposition to dollar intervention kept Treasuries supported. At settlement the curve was little changed.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLE (USD) 0.18 HIGHER AT 56.20; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 0.07 HIGHER AT 63.46/BBL: </strong>The crude complex again traded higher in the European session before coming off highs into the US session, where it traded choppy through till settlement. Analysts at Citigroup highlight the low volumes on Friday, in addition to book squaring from Brent August futures option expiries, as both being drivers of tape action. Russian Energy Minister Novak said that Russian oil output may fluctuate within a month due to a number of factors, presumably the ongoing contaminated oil issue being one factor. Sources also reported Russian production stood at 11.1mln BPD between July 1st to 25th (prev. 11.05mln BPD between July 1st to 21st), which is still within the OPEC+ agreement for supply cuts. Mexico's Pemex said its crude production fell by more than 10% in Q2 (when compared to Q2 2018) to reach 1.661mln BPD, seeing year-end production at 1.72mln BPD (prev. 1.70mln BPD). Baker Hughes US rig count this week showed oil rigs -3 at 776, gas rigs -5 at 169, total rigs -8 at 946; where US drillers cut rigs for the fourth week, and eighth month, in a row.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.7% AT 3026, NASDAQ-10 1.1% AT 8017, DOW JONES&nbsp; 0.2% AT 27192, SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples 1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Energy -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Financials 1%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Materials 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services 3.3%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities 0.4%.</p><p><strong>* US EARNINGS:</strong>&nbsp;Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG) shot higher after the tech co. reported earnings that beat on revenue, operating income and profit expectations and announced a new USD 25bln share buyback. Desks were also enthused by a decent reacceleration in websites growth. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved lower; the co. beat on revenue expectations and paid unit growth was strong, however, operating income from its investments into one-day Prime delivery disappointed. Intel Corp. (INTC) beat on both top and bottom lines where it caught a bid pre-market however gains gradually pared back throughout the session, nonetheless competitors still benefitted from the report as they raised guidance and as Apple (AAPL) also confirmed plans to acquire Intel’s smartphone modem business for USD 1bln. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) moved higher after the co. posted strong earnings across the board; beating on top and bottom line, raised guidance, including for its FY19 global comparable store sales growth outlook. Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) jumped higher after revenue came in ahead, with advertising a particular bright spot, whilst the co.’s new monetizable daily average users metric also exceeded expectations. Mohawk Industries (MHK) sunk after reporting disappointing earnings; the co. beat on EPS expectations, but revenue and guidance disappointments, in addition to negative comments from its CEO, dragged the share price lower. Mattel (MAT) jumped higher premarket after the co. posted a smaller loss than expected and exceeded expectations on the revenue front. AbbVie (ABBV) shares advanced after the drug maker beat on the top and bottom line and, crucially, sales of its headline drug Humira came in ahead of expectations. Other notable stocks benefitting from strong earnings include; Fiserv Inc (FISV), Alaska Air Group Inc (ALK), Edison Int'l (EIX), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Republic Services Inc (RSG), ResMed (RMD), Stryker Corp. (SYK), SVB Financial (SIVB), Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS). Other notable stocks suffering after disappointing earnings; Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation (COG), Charter Communications (CHTR), Eastman Chemical (EMN), Fortive Corp (FTV), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Ventas Inc (VTR). Elsewhere, Colgate Palmolive (CL) were initially lower, but gradually pared back and closed higher following earnings.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong>&nbsp;T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S) advanced after the DoJ approved their merger, which includes a USD 5bln divestment condition; wireless assets will be sold to Dish Networks (DISH), whose shares also bounced, creating a fourth national wireless competitor. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) advanced on the news that its former boss could become a mediator with activist investor Carl Ichan, who has spoken out against the co.’s recent takeover of Anadarko Petroleum, saying the merger did not maximise value for shareholders. Financials were a strong performing sector, assisted by upgrades for Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) at Keefe Bruyette and analyst chatter of rotation into the sector. 3M (MMM) fell on the news that it had disclosed an internal compliance probe to the DoJ and SEC involving travel activities, related funding &amp; record keeping issues raising concerns from marketing efforts by business groups in China.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong>&nbsp;The <strong>USD</strong> index, DXY, moved back above 98.00; on a day where; US GDP beat expectations, <strong>GBP </strong>came under renewed Brexit related pressure (with after initial conversations between UK PM Johnson and EU leaders showing little prospect of a compromise on either side), the <strong>antipodeans </strong>continued to slide after dovish impulses from earlier in the week. Dollar also saw a leg higher on the back of NEC Director Kudlow comments, in which he disagreed that US President Trump is looking for a weaker dollar and said that the US would not intervene in the FX markets, however later reports contradicted this. Safe havens were mixed; <strong>CHF </strong>continued its post less-dovish-than-expected ECB decline, EURCHF moving back above 1.1050, whilst <strong>JPY </strong>was a touch firmer; USDJPY caught between 108.55-108.85 parameters. <strong>CAD </strong>was weaker on the firm buck, USDCAD nearly touching the 1.3200 handle before paring gains. <strong>RUB </strong>was unresponsive to a widely expected CBR rate cut, USDRUB taking its cue from dollar strength later in the session. Elsewhere in EMFX; <strong>TRY </strong>extended yesterday's post CBRT gains whilst the <strong>ZAR </strong>sunk on concerns over a possible incoming ratings downgrade at Moody’s, whilst Fitch revised their outlook to negative.</p><p><strong>* RANSQUAWK CENTRAL BANKS - 26TH JULY 2019: </strong>PREVIEWING: FOMC, BOE, BOJ, BCB.

Dollar also saw a leg higher on the back of NEC Director Kudlow comments, in which he disagreed that US President Trump is looking for a weaker dollar and said that the US would not intervene in the FX markets, however later reports contradicted this. <strong>Safe havens</strong> were mixed; <strong>CHF</strong> continued its post less-dovish-than-expected ECB decline, EURCHF moving back above 1.1050, whilst <strong>JPY</strong> was a touch firmer; USDJPY caught between 108.55-108.85 parameters. <strong>CAD</strong> was weaker on the firm buck, USDCAD nearly touching the 1.3200 handle before paring gains. <strong>RUB</strong> was unresponsive to a widely expected CBR rate cut, USDRUB taking its cue from dollar strength later in the session. Elsewhere in EMFX; <strong>TRY</strong> extended yesterday's post CBRT gains whilst the <strong>ZAR</strong> sunk on concerns over a possible incoming ratings downgrade at Moody’s, whilst Fitch revised their outlook to negative.</p>",

Russian Energy Minister Novak said that Russian oil output may fluctuate within a month due to a number of factors, presumably the ongoing contaminated oil issue being one factor. Sources also reported Russian production stood at 11.1mln BPD between July 1st to 25th (prev. 11.05mln BPD between July 1st to 21st), which is still within the OPEC+ agreement for supply cuts. Mexico's Pemex said its crude production fell by more than 10% in Q2 (when compared to Q2 2018) to reach 1.661mln BPD, seeing year-end production at 1.72mln BPD (prev. 1.70mln BPD).

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: US GDP beats consensus, but pales in comparison to ECB as a headline event",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is ending the week on a high and fittingly in wake of US Q2 GDP data that exceeded expectations in more than one metric, as consumption and the deflator both accelerated circa 4-fold from the previous quarter. However, the Greenback also benefited from weakness elsewhere, positive developments on the US-China trade front and a 2 year budget deal that allows for increased expenditure. The <strong>DXY</strong> struggled to clear Fib resistance around 97.767 on a closing basis more than once, with preliminary Markit PMIs revealing weakness in the manufacturing sector, but finally cleared the chart hurdle on the eve of the big release of the week. 98.065 has traded ahead of 98.281 (May 30 peak) and the 98.371 ytd peak (from May 23), but the FOMC looms and coincides with month end that is often unsupportive from a portfolio rebalancing angle.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The biggest G10 loser on Friday and over the course of the week, largely due to growing calls for the RBA and RBNZ to continue their respective easing cycles with a couple more 25 bp rate cuts, but also as Central Bank officials themselves indicated further monetary policy loosening. To recap, RBA Assistant Governor Kent noted that the Aussie would have been stronger without back-to-back rate cuts and welcomed global Central Bank easing, while Governor Lowe seemed to walk back from wait-and-see by underlining a willingness to lower the OCR again if demand disappoints. Aud/Usd is slipping closer to 0.6900 vs highs of 0.7057 and Nzd/Usd is testing 0.6635 from 0.6785 at one stage, while Aud/Nzd skirts 1.0400.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has been relatively rangebound between 1.1102-1.1225 and is holding in quite well above the weekly and new 2019 base vs the Buck after an exceptionally volatile ECB day when the bulk of the Eur/Usd price movement occurred. In short, the Euro knee-jerked higher on the unchanged rate decision given some 50% or a bit more of the market factoring a 10 bp cut in the depo rate, even though the actual consensus according to analysts surveyed was firmly for unchanged. The headline pair and Eur crosses subsequently hit lows as guidance was tweaked to add ‘or lower’ to current levels through Summer 2020 at least and the accompanying statement revealed that a range of other policy measures are being looked at by Eurosystem Committees, including a fresh round of QE, tiering and better ways to reinforce FG. However, President Draghi dialled down dovish perceptions in the post-meeting press conference and especially during the Q&amp;A when he announced that no rate cut was even discussed, while the changes in guidance were reached after broad discussion and by consensus rather than unanimously. Nevertheless, there was more than enough in his penultimate appearance before leaving to signal something is coming in September and sources subsequently suggested that the GC is essentially signed up to a standard rate cut, and could be on board for more PSPP.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>All weaker vs the Usd on the final session of the week and overall, as the Yen retreats from around 107.70 at best towards 109.00 against the backdrop of firmer US Treasury yields and bearish technical impulses on the breach of a major Fib (108.31) into next week’s BoJ policy meeting that culminates just 24 hours before the FOMC. Meanwhile, the Loonie was undermined by weak Canadian wholesale trade data and failed to get much impetus from spikes in crude prices as Usd/Cad rallied from circa 1.3040 to just shy of 1.3200 where supply resides. The Franc also retreated during the course of the week amidst almost persistent speculation about potential SNB intervention that reached a crescendo into the aforementioned ECB policy gathering, with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf both nearer the tops of 0.9942-0.9804 and 1.1061-1.0963 respective ranges. Elsewhere, the Pound benefited from a relief rally in the absence of major UK macro impulses after confirmation that Boris Johnson will takeover the Conservative Party leadership from Thresa May and role of PM as a result. However, Cable could not clear multi-tops around 1.2520 and is now testing 2019 lows around 1.2383 on broad Dollar strength and after the first Brexit exchanges between the new PM and EU officials merely underlined the marked lines of divergence over withdrawal.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some very volatile moves in regional currencies and not always logical or in sync with fundamentals as the Turkish Lira rallied despite a huge 425 bp CBRT rate cut, as guidance suggested caution in terms of further easing and this approach was backed by President Erdogan. Meanwhile, the Rouble softened in wake of a widely anticipated 2nd consecutive 25 bp CBR rate cut as a further ease was flagged and the Rand was hit hard on a combination of technical selling once 14.0000 and a couple of key chart levels were crossed plus negative ratings reviews/outlooks from Fitch and Moody’s prompted by fiscal and political concerns caused by new aid for Eskom and corruption investigations.</p>",

In contrast, consensus for the Fed has narrowed to ¼ point for starters and seems unlikely to change materially barring a major development between now and next week’s FOMC. Hence, Aud/Usd has slipped further below 0.6950 towards 0.6925 and July 10’s 0.6911 base beckons before 0.6900, while Nzd/Usd is looking vulnerable under 0.6650 given no real support ahead of 0.6600 and the mtd trough way down at 0.6568.</p><p><strong>ZAR</strong> - The Rand continues to reel after its brief post-SARB rebound on the threat of a SA rating downgrade and bearish technical impulses following the break of 14.0000 against the Buck, with key Fib resistance also breached at 14.1360 on the way to 14.1780 and the next chart target looming just shy of 14.2000 in the form of the 200 DMA (14.1920).</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - Amidst broad Greenback gains vs G10 and other counterparts, the index has finally cleared a key technical hurdle of its own at 97.767 and is now nudging 98.000 ahead of US GDP data that could provide more impetus or hamper further advances.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/EUR/CHF/CAD</strong> - All on the backfoot, as the Yen fails to glean any traction from mixed Japanese inflation data ahead of the BoJ meeting and meanders between 105.57-73 parameters, while Cable has topped out around 1.2520 yet again and saw stops tripped through trend-line support circa 1.2445 to 1.2425 low. Elsewhere, the single currency has drifted back down from post-ECB rebound highs not far from 1.1200, but holding above the minor new pre-Draghi presser 2019 low and the Franc remains off recent highs in 0.9900-20 and 1.050-38 respective bands vs the Dollar and Euro respectively, with perhaps some acknowledgement of a 25 bp SNB rate cut call from UBS. Similarly, the Loonie is softer within a 1.3157-83 range and prone to the aforementioned US data ahead of Canada’s May budget balance.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Unlike the depreciating Zar, the Try is still unwinding initial post-CBRT losses as Turkish President Erdogan applauds the bold 425 bp move and concurs with the more cautious approach towards further easing between now and the end of the year. The Lira is holding ‘comfortably’ above 5.7000 vs the Buck and the Rouble seems almost as content or prepared for the CBR to cut rates again, with Usd/Rub around 63.1000 and at the lower end of 63.2500-0695 parameters.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have all steadied the ship after fading and slipping through near term chart supports into negative territory as the ECB fall-out resumed along with a stock market rebound and SPF projections that did not really provide or add clarity over probable stimulus in September. The respective 10 year debt futures posted fresh intraday lows of 173.96, 131.79 and 127-065, but are now off worst levels again in contrast to the Italian benchmark that is back below 140.00 within a 140.40-139.35 range vs yesterday’s 141.60 contract peak and weighed down by renewed coalition Government angst. Ahead, US GDP looks set to be the major event in terms of market-moving data.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Little to report on the energy front as <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are relatively flat following the decline in the complex heading into yesterday’s settlement. The former currently hovers just above the 56/bbl ahead of its 50 and 200 DMAs at 56.73/bbl and 57.03/bbl respectively, whilst the latter resides around the 63.50/bbl mark. Looking at this week’s performance so far, both benchmarks are currently poised to post gains, albeit off highs. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> kicked the week off around 55.70/bbl and 62.60/bbl and have reached highs of 57.62/bbl and 64.64/bbl respectively, bolstered by geopolitical woes. Next up, traders will be eyeing the US Q2 GDP release as the next potential catalyst, with headline expectations of 1.8% annualized growth (Prev. 3.1% in Q1) which would mark the lowest quarterly growth rate since early 2016. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> is flat despite a firmer Buck as the yellow metal eyes the US tier 1 data release at 1330BST. The precious metal looks set to end the week on the backfoot (weekly range: 1411-33/oz) as the gains seen from rising geopolitical tensions earlier in the week was erased during the ECB press conference yesterday. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> is lackluster and has dipped below the 2.70/lb amid the cautious risk tone and is currently at the bottom of the weekly 2.68-76/lb range thus far. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices climbed over 3% overnight with traders citing a rise in demand as smaller steel mills take advantage of the production curb on larger competitors amid pollution.</p>",

On the flipside, material names lag, heavily weighted on by Anglo American (-5.0%) after metals tycoon Agarwal sold his stake in the mining name. Elsewhere, gains in the consumer discretionary sector is capped by Kering (-6.5%) after the fashion name open lower in excess of 9% amid disappointing Gucci sales. Meanwhile, optimistic numbers from Intel (+5.4% pre-market) buoyed the European chip names ASM (+3.7%) and STMicroelectonics (+2.2%) and Infineon (+1.0%). Finally, Bayer (+1.4%) shares have received further reprieve after a US judge lowered the verdict against the Co. in the Roundup case to USD 86.7mln from USD 2.2bln.

In contrast, consensus for the Fed has narrowed to ¼ point for starters and seems unlikely to change materially barring a major development between now and next week’s FOMC. Hence, Aud/Usd has slipped further below 0.6950 towards 0.6925 and July 10’s 0.6911 base beckons before 0.6900, while Nzd/Usd is looking vulnerable under 0.6650 given no real support ahead of 0.6600 and the mtd trough way down at 0.6568.</p><p><strong>ZAR</strong></p><p>The Rand continues to reel after its brief post-SARB rebound on the threat of a SA rating downgrade and bearish technical impulses following the break of 14.0000 against the Buck, with key Fib resistance also breached at 14.1360 on the way to 14.1780 and the next chart target looming just shy of 14.2000 in the form of the 200 DMA (14.1920).</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Amidst broad Greenback gains vs G10 and other counterparts, the index has finally cleared a key technical hurdle of its own at 97.767 and is now nudging 98.000 ahead of US GDP data that could provide more impetus or hamper further advances.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/EUR/CHF/CAD</strong></p><p>All on the backfoot, as the Yen fails to glean any traction from mixed Japanese inflation data ahead of the BoJ meeting and meanders between 105.57-73 parameters, while Cable has topped out around 1.2520 yet again and saw stops tripped through trend-line support circa 1.2445 to 1.2425 low. Elsewhere, the single currency has drifted back down from post-ECB rebound highs not far from 1.1200, but holding above the minor new pre-Draghi presser 2019 low and the Franc remains off recent highs in 0.9900-20 and 1.050-38 respective bands vs the Dollar and Euro respectively, with perhaps some acknowledgement of a 25 bp SNB rate cut call from UBS. Similarly, the Loonie is softer within a 1.3157-83 range and prone to the aforementioned US data ahead of Canada’s May budget balance.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unlike the depreciating Zar, the Try is still unwinding initial post-CBRT losses as Turkish President Erdogan applauds the bold 425 bp move and concurs with the more cautious approach towards further easing between now and the end of the year. The Lira is holding ‘comfortably’ above 5.7000 vs the Buck and the Rouble seems almost as content or prepared for the CBR to cut rates again, with Usd/Rub around 63.1000 and at the lower end of 63.2500-0695 parameters.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* EXPECTATIONS: </strong>CBR expected to cut rates by 25bps to 7.25%, and following the rate cut in June, the it unwinds the two precautionary hikes implemented late 2018. Analysts suggest that a deeper rate cut is not on the agenda given elevated inflation expectations, the policy rate sitting just above neutral (estimated at between 6-7%). Looking ahead, the market is currently pricing in three rate cuts over the next nine months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* INFLATION: </strong>Price pressures have been cooling more quickly than anticipated, but at 4.5% Y/Y remains within the CBR's 4.2% to 4.7% year-end forecasted range. However, consumer inflation expectations remain high, perhaps limiting the scope for a deeper than 25bps rate cut; with that said, corporate inflation expectations, a gauge watched by the CBR, has been softening notably. Nordea's analysts argue that there is room for further softness due to base effects from H2 2018 (when inflation was rising on RUB declines, and gasoline prices rises). It also says that current inflation could be at a level consistent with the 4% Y/Y target, signaling more disinflation ahead.</p><p><strong>* REACTION: </strong>The RUB may only see limited moves on the back of a consensus -25bps, since policymakers have guided to such an outcome. Nordea says the RUB will be more focussed on the outcome of the FOMC's 31st July meeting; the bank thinks that any move lower in OFZ yields will require distinctly more dovish communications (perhaps: hints on a lower estimate of neutral, or the Fed fulfilling market expectations of the future cuts); \"Given that an upside in OFZ prices is currently limited, the developments in this market are now much less important for the RUB than they used to be in early 2019 when OFZ repricing was attracting foreign investors and creating additional RUB demand. Now that the change in the CBR communication is more or less priced in, the Fed’s moves are much more important for the RUB than the CBR decisions.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade negative as the region conforms to the downbeat global risk tone after the ECB failed to satisfy the dovish bets despite paving the way for a future cut, while disappointing earnings also adds to the glum. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are lower with tech and financials leading the declines in Australia, while sentiment in Tokyo is dampened by disappointing results including Nissan which reported an almost 95% Y/Y drop in Q2 net and with the worst performers list also dominated by several mid-caps post-earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are subdued after further PBoC inaction resulted to a net weekly liquidity drain of CNY 410bln with underperformance in Hong Kong after poor trade data for June in which Exports slipped 9.0% Y/Y and as protesters plan to take their rally to the Hong Kong International Airport.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat and consolidates following the prior day’s rebound amid expectations of a less aggressive move by the Fed next week and as currencies bide their time ahead of today’s US GDP data. EUR/USD is also uneventful overnight which is a sharp contrast to the prior day’s post-ECB tumultuous trade in which a dovish reaction was triggered after the central bank tweaked its forward guidance on interest rates to pave the way for a future rate cut, before EUR/USD recouped losses after ECB’s Draghi was less dovish than some had hoped during the press conference as he noted there was no discussion on a rate cut and that some in the GC had doubts about a two-tiered system, while he added that he wants to see the next economic projections before taking action and views the risk of a recession as 'low'. Furthermore, pressure was then seen again in late hours after ECB sources stated they see the deposit rate cut as almost certain in September. Elsewhere, GBP/USD is unmoved and USD/JPY holds on to most its post-ECB gains with a muted reaction seen after mixed Tokyo CPI data, while antipodeans are lacklustre amid the risk averse tone and with participants looking ahead to upcoming risk events for want of a better catalyst.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued as they mirrored the lacklustre tone in USTs and European counterparts after a less dovish than hoped ECB, although downside is also stemmed amid weakness in stocks and the BoJ’s presence in the market today.</p>",
