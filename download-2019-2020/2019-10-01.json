However, prior to the US session Fixed Income assets were on the backfoot, with JGBs leading the losses after a disappointing 10-year auction; desks were attributing the move as somewhat of a “taper tantrum” amid the BoJ’s latest efforts in reducing its bond purchases to steepen the curve. Fed’s repo operation was again undersubscribed in more evidence to easing liquidity conditions in money markets. By Treasury settlement the curve had bear steepened, no part assisted by growing market expectations of an October rate cut by the Fed, with the 2-year yield down by 6bps, 10-year yield down by 2bps, and the 30-year yield little changed.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 -1.2% at 2940, NASDAQ-100 -0.8% at 7684, Dow Jones -1.3% at 26573 </strong>* SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary -0.8%, Consumer Staples -0.3%, Energy -2.3%, Financials -2.1%, Health Care -1%, Industrials -2.4%, Information Technology -0.9%, Materials -2.3%, Telecommunication Services -1%, Utilities -0.3% ETRADE (ETFC) dived after Charles Schwab (SCHW) announced it would be reducing its commission on US stocks, ETFs and options trading to zero, which also saw its own shares trade lower. McCormick (MKC) surged on beating top- and bottom-line estimates whilst raising FY guidance. McDonald’s (MCD) traded at the bottom of the Dow after a negative mention at JPMorgan. KeyBanc upgraded Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) all to Overweight, seeing them open higher and supporting the wider semiconductor sector (SOX), however, gains were capped by Xilinx (XLNX), where the same analyst downgraded it to Sector Weight. Diamondback Energy (FANG) opened on the back foot on an unexpected executive departure and PT cut; Biogen (BIIB) was another stock who underperformed after an executive departure, namely its R&amp;D head Michael Ehlers. Ulta Beauty surged as it launched a Jennifer Lopez fragrance, in addition to tailwinds from insider share purchases.</p>",

It is also worth noting that the ISM survey does not necessarily correspond with other manufacturing gauges; Markit today revised up its US manufacturing PMI in September, while the Philly Fed regional survey is performing well; however, the Chicago PMI, as well as the Richmond Fed manufacturing gauges have all seen downside. Pantheon Macroeconomics, looking for a silver-lining, observe that if there was any good news in the ISM data, it would be that the fall is due entirely to weakness in the lagging components (production, delivery times, employment and inventories) while orders, which lead, nudged up a tenth. \"If orders have now stabilised, the headline index should not fall significantly further,\" Pantheon writes, \"but it is already weak enough to signal that the manufacturing sector will remain in recession for the foreseeable future, having contracted in both the first and second quarters, while capital spending and exports look set to roll over.\" With an eye on international trade, the export orders index fell to the lowest since April 2009, and Pantheon says it is consistent (if sustained) with exports falling at a near 20% annualized rate. And ahead of this week's NFP, the employment sub-index continues to weaken; \"manufacturing accounts for just 8.4% of payrolls but the ISM employment index is decent indicator of job growth across the whole economy, and this reading is consistent with our view that payroll growth will be trending at just 50-to-75K by the year end,\" Pantheon says. In terms of growth, the ISM has said that today's data is consistent with 1.5% Y/Y growth in 2019 (NOTE: the FOMC has forecast 2.2% for this year). Pantheon concludes that this survey is a not consistent with recession across the whole economy, but the warning signs are clear enough: \"The trade war is wreaking havoc, to the point where the incipient upturn in manufacturing in China is not transmitting, at all, to the US,\" Adding that this meant \"if consumers' confidence seriously falters, the US could tip into the first recession ever caused directly by the actions of the President, rather than the action of tight monetary policy on an overstretched private sector.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Evans (Voter, Dove) reiterated that after the recent rate cuts, the Fed should leave policy on hold for some time, and there was a limit to what monetary policy can achieve, though monetary policy needed some repositioning to align against risks. On inflation, Evans said the Fed needs to have a whatever it takes approach to meeting its mandate, especially in meeting its 2% inflation target. Elsewhere, Evans said the US business sector has softened due to weak global demand.</p><p><strong>*</strong> <strong>CHINA: </strong>China President Xi Jinping delivered a speech to mark the 70th Anniversary of the PRC by stating that \"no force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation\". At a military parade, China unveiled the nuclear-capable Dongfeng 41 missile, which analysts said could reach the US within 30 minutes. On the Hong Kong situation, Xi said China would \"maintain long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau,\" and “forging ahead, we must remain committed to the strategy of peaceful reunification, and 'One Country, Two Systems,\" and that China would \"advance peaceful development of cross-strait relations, unite the whole country and continue to strive forward the complete unification of our country.\" Xi did not mention any country specifically in his remarks. Elsewhere, following on reports surrounding the potential limits of US investment in Chinese securities, CNBC reported the WH circulated a memo which did not make a policy recommendation, but it did outline the reasons why potential investment limits should be studied. CNBC note that the next step in the memo was to arrange a meeting with the Policy Coordinating Committee, suggesting a&nbsp;meeting could be held this week.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE SEPTEMBER INFLATION: </strong>Although headline inflation eased to 0.9% Y/Y from 1.0%, the core measure rose from 0.9% to 1.0%. ING argues that the overall picture of underlying softness in core inflation should worry the ECB as it could persist due to recession fears. Ahead, energy base effects will likely push the headline higher, though ING still feels it will not result in a sustainable move towards the ECB's 2.0% target. \"The underlying picture for inflation continues to be weak as drivers of inflation have recently started to soften,\" ING writes, \"this is partly driven by weaker producer price developments, but also related to significant declines in selling price expectations of businesses over recent months. Even though services inflation did tick up to 1.5% in September, it is unlikely that we’ll see a significant jump in core inflation in the months ahead.\" The bank says that economic uncertainty means businesses will still be reluctant to increase their margins, and so recent positive wage growth developments are not translating into higher inflation. \"This has been the case for some time now but as recession fears will likely loom for at least a few months to come, it seems unlikely that core inflation will improve significantly in the months ahead. Interestingly, this modest inflation environment could in itself be helpful to stave off a recession as it boosts real household incomes which, in turn, helps to keep domestic demand growth in positive territory.\" In terms of ECB policy, the data will not be too surprising; \"The smorgasbord of stimulus that ECB President Mario Draghi announced a few weeks ago will need to have quite some impact to see core inflation move out of the 1% range in the course of 2020,\" ING writes, \"if it does not, the ECB's own expectations for core inflation may once again need to be lowered.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB: ECB’s Weidmann </strong>(hawk) says it is imperative that breaching measures like government bond purchases lead to intensive discussion, and he hopes decisions will not lead to APP restrictions being called into question.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>The Reserve Bank cut its cash rate by 25bps to a new record low of 0.75%, as most analysts were expecting. The central bank retained its easing bias, and is prepared to ease further, despite it seeing the economy at a \"gentle turning point.\" The statement was tweaked, and now concludes that the RBA will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time. Analysts noted that the inclusion of 'full employment' was a dovish development (changed from 'reduce unemployment'), that may bring forward any easing timeline at the RBA.</p><p><strong>* CANADA GDP: </strong>The headline M/M pace was unchanged, missing expectations for a pick-up to 0.1%, putting its best growth streak in two years to bed. The pickup in services was offset by a heavy decline in goods, particularly in oil and gas extraction. In the BoC’s September meeting, they did note it expected economic activity to slow in H2, which would be in fitting with today’s data. The decline in oil and gas is important; BoC’s Schembri recently said the Bank pays close attention to falling commodity prices (despite dropping the language from the statement) which could reduce rates into negative territory in an extreme case. Canadian bank RBC highlights that manufacturing segment of GDP was only down slightly (-0.1% M/M), although the sector’s outperformance in relation to other countries, such as Germany and US, is gradually fading. Adding the good news, there is little evidence suggesting the manufacturing decline is filtering through into the larger services economy. RBC concluded that, as the data is in line with the BoC’s view, but with a few signs of a broader slowdown, it gives the BoC time to be patient in assessing whether more accommodation is needed to offset external headwinds.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 11 TICKS HIGHER AT 130-21: </strong>The TPLEX lived up to its haven status, disappointing US ISM data saw yields break lower as investors flocked into sovereign bonds amid US growth concerns jumping right back into the limelight and of such raising chances of further Fed accommodation. However, prior to the US session Fixed Income assets were on the backfoot, with JGBs leading the losses after a disappointing 10-year auction; desks were attributing the move as somewhat of a “taper tantrum” amid the BoJ’s latest efforts in reducing its bond purchases to steepen the curve. Fed’s repo operation was again undersubscribed in more evidence to easing liquidity conditions in money markets. By Treasury settlement the curve had bear steepened, no part assisted by growing market expectations of an October rate cut by the Fed, with the 2-year yield down by 6bps, 10-year yield down by 2bps, and the 30-year yield little changed.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.45 LOWER AT USD 53.62/BBL; BRENT (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 0.36 LOWER AT USD 58.89/BBL. </strong>Benchmarks were tentatively bid before becoming victim to a shoddy ISM-induced risk off move. Following Monday’s isolated sell off in energy markets, benchmarks found support earlier in the session amid the latest OPEC survey from Bloomberg suggesting September production out of the cartel had fallen by 1.59mln BPD to 28.32mln BPD (larger than the 0.75mln BPD fall to 28.9mln BPD suggested by the Reuters survey on Monday); major equity bourses trading in the green also provided support to oil prices, up until the surprise fall in US ISM manufacturing. Crude and other risk assets continued to trundle lower through the tail-end of the US session as economic uncertainties rung louder. The next, foreseen, risk event for energy is the latest US energy inventory data, with the API reporting its initial readings after the bell on Tuesday; current expectations (barrels) have crude stocks +1.6mln, gasoline +0.4mln, distillates -1.8mln.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (HK/IRAN/NK): </strong>A Hong Kong protestor was shot at demonstrations today, and was left in a critical condition. The death is likely to embolden protestors, analysts said. Across the east China sea, South Korean fighter jets reportedly conducted patrols over the islands disputed by Japan. On trade, South Korea urged Japan to re-examine its position on export curbs as there are still curbs in play for three key materials in semiconductors, with one of the materials, liquid hydrogen fluoride, not having a single export approved in almost 3 months. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia reportedly gave the green light to talks with Iran, with both sides seeking to arrange a meeting; the Iranian’s announced their doors are open and welcome a resolution through dialogue. However, talks between Iran and the US would be more pinnacle for progress, with both sides sticking to their roots and Iran reiterating that no talks can take place unless the US removes sanctions, something the US has said will not happen. On the North Korean front, both NK and the US have reportedly agreed to hold working level talks with each other this Saturday (5th Oct), although looking at historical meetings between the two nations reveals such events rarely evolve to be much more than a photo opportunity.</p><p><strong>* BOJ Q3 TANKAN SURVEY: </strong>Large manufacturers confidence fell to a six-year low at +5 in September, from +7 in June, though fared better than the consensus view for +2. However, under the bonnet, the outlook index fell from +7 to +2 on the higher sales tax, while capex plans had deteriorated, which will not go unnoticed at the BOJ (+6.6% Y/Y versus +7.4% in June), especially following comments by BOJ governor Kuroda last week, where he said he expects domestic demand to remain firm as companies invest. In terms of the currency, the survey showed firms have lowered their USDJPY forecast to 108.68 for the FY 2019/20 (from 109.35). And in terms of the policy implications, Capital Economics said conditions are still a bit better than in 2016, when the BOJ conducted a comprehensive review that ended with the introduction of Yield Curve Control. \"Back then, the Bank didn't cut its short-term policy rate. And given that the Bank's concerns about the impact of looser policy on the health of banks have risen since then as their capital ratios have kept falling, today's figures do not present a clear-cut case for lowering the short-term policy rate any further.\"</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Two sources had suggested that the EU was prepared to consider offering the UK a time-limit to the Irish backstop, and may consider a backstop for Northern Ireland only with the Northern Irish able to say whether it remains within the backstop. The report added that the EU only sees itself making concession if the UK accepts the backstop, and they would mull the idea of giving Northern Ireland a say on leaving the Brexit backstop. The DUP has recently indicated that it might be able to support a backstop if it had a time-limit; however, Dublin has not previously warmed to the idea. Either way, the report was subsequently denied by an EU Commission Spokesman, saying the EU is not considering this option at all, and reiterated they are waiting for UK to come forward with a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop. Elsewhere, UK PM Johnson is to release a “final Brexit plan”, in which formal proposals will be made regarding a replacement to the Irish backstop. The exact content of the proposal remains to be seen, with UK PM Johnson reluctant to reveal the details when pressed, although he did say that the offer will be “very good” and relate to agrifoods; that is likely to be unveiled on Wednesday or Thursday, according to guidance earlier in the week. The Telegraph reported that the proposal is to be based on the creation of an all-Ireland economic zone, which will allow the movement of food and other agricultural goods about the island without checks. Other reports alleged the UK is also to propose customs clearing centres on both sides of the border, an idea criticised by Irish PM Varadkar. Similar reports speculated that such checks would occur within 5-10 miles of the border, however, BBC later reported that the legal text to be put to the EU would not state a specific distance from the border. Elsewhere, UK Shadow Chancellor McDonnell said that a no-confidence vote in the government is unlikely prior to the European Council Summit meeting on 17-18 October, seemingly clearing the way for the government to attempt to strike a deal with the EU before parliament attempts to topple it.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> A quiet start as participants awaited the Manufacturing ISM data where many had hoped for a rebound out of contractionary territory to print in the low 50s. The data surprised to the downside which saw DXY come off its 99.674 high back towards the 99 handle for the remainder of the session. The second consecutive contractionary manufacturing reading drove expectations for a 25bp cut at the Fed’s October meeting to 50% from just shy of 40% as participants now await Friday’s job report and a heavy slate of central bank speakers.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Markit Manufacturing PMI came in at 48.3 beating estimates for a decline to 47 from 47.4. However, albeit a rosy headline, IHS noted that the new orders, output and employment continued to decline but was offset by purchasing and a rise in input stocks as Brexit preparations restarted. On the Brexit front, it was reported that the EU is to consider a time limit on the Irish backstop; which saw GBPUSD spike through 1.23 printing highs of 1.2340, however some of the moves were pared as details were limited. The news however was denied by an EU Commission spokesman, and a number of other sources, which drove the cross back beneath the key 1.23 handle.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency initially saw lows of 1.0880 in the morning however reclaimed the 1.09 handle as it shrugged off weak manufacturing PMI data as well as a soft HICP reading, where EURUSD took its cues from USD weakness seeing highs just shy of 1.0950 at 1.0942.</p><p><strong>Havens:</strong> Havens were heavily bid on Tuesday post poor US ISM with XAU rallying from 1459 lows to highs of 1487, and CHF &amp; JPY outperforming their crosses. USDJPY fell through the 108 level in the wake of the release and continued to fall throughout the remainder of the session finding support between 107.65-70 where bids were cited, just ahead of the 21dma at 107.58.</p><p><strong>Antipodes:</strong> AUD an underperformer as the RBA cut rates by 25bp, when some had been expecting rates to remain unchanged, however the language that a gentle turning point appears to have been reached initially saw some upside to the Aussie, however gains quickly pared and headed lower throughout the remainder of the session printing decade long lows of 0.6673 before paring back above the 0.67 level on weakness in the Buck. The Kiwi also traded lower today continuing the losses from the poor business outlook driven further by poor business confidence data pout of the region, however NZDUSD found support at the 0.62 handle before paring back some losses, boosted by a weaker greenback.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -1.2% at 2940, NASDAQ-100 -0.8% at 7684, Dow Jones -1.3% at 26573</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.8%, Consumer Staples -0.3%, Energy -2.3%, Financials -2.1%, Health Care -1%, Industrials -2.4%, Information Technology -0.9%, Materials -2.3%, Telecommunication Services -1%, Utilities -0.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>ETRADE (ETFC) dived after Charles Schwab (SCHW) announced it would be reducing its commission on US stocks, ETFs and options trading to zero, which also saw its own shares trade lower. McCormick (MKC) surged on beating top- and bottom-line estimates whilst raising FY guidance. McDonald’s (MCD) traded at the bottom of the Dow after a negative mention at JPMorgan. KeyBanc upgraded Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) all to Overweight, seeing them open higher and supporting the wider semiconductor sector (SOX), however, gains were capped by Xilinx (XLNX), where the same analyst downgraded it to Sector Weight. Diamondback Energy (FANG) opened on the back foot on an unexpected executive departure and PT cut; Biogen (BIIB) was another stock who underperformed after an executive departure, namely its R&amp;D head Michael Ehlers. Ulta Beauty surged as it launched a Jennifer Lopez fragrance, in addition to tailwinds from insider share purchases.</p><p>* <strong>S. KOREA INFLATION:</strong> CPI -0.4% Y/Y in September, the first negative reading since the series began in 1965, on lower farm products prices (after last year's high levels) combined with weak consumer demand.</p>",

Following Monday’s isolated sell off in energy markets, benchmarks found support earlier in the session amid the latest OPEC survey from Bloomberg suggesting September production out of the cartel had fallen by 1.59mln BPD to 28.32mln BPD (larger than the 0.75mln BPD fall to 28.9mln BPD suggested by the Reuters survey on Monday); major equity bourses trading in the green also provided support to oil prices, up until the surprise fall in US ISM manufacturing. Crude and other risk assets continued to trundle lower through the tail-end of the US session as economic uncertainties rung louder. The next, foreseen, risk event for energy is the latest US energy inventory data, with the API reporting its initial readings after the bell on Tuesday; current expectations (barrels) have crude stocks +1.6mln, gasoline +0.4mln, distillates -1.8mln.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback was printing fresh highs vs many currency counterparts and the <strong>DXY</strong> extending its ytd best beyond 97.500 to 99.674 when another big ISM manufacturing miss more than overshadowed a marginal uptick in Markit’s PMI. Indeed, the margin of the decline and shortfall against consensus also outweighed ‘improvements’ in new orders and a rebound in prices paid to just under the 50.0 mark, especially with employment also falling further below the threshold just days away from NFP. In response, the Buck recoiled across the board and the index retreated to 99.226 before finding some underlying bids and perhaps spec buyers looking for a bounce on the basis that ISM flags a considerably lower headline level (42.9) as the real line between expansion and contraction.</p><p><strong>AUD/SEK/NZD/SEK</strong></p><p>Although the US Dollar’s demise was relatively swift and pronounced, the Aussie only derived a degree of respite from post-dovish RBA rate cut selling pressure, and not before sliding to a fresh 2019 low just under 0.6675, while the Swedish Crown also remained on the backfoot following an even sharper slowdown in manufacturing activity with Eur/Sek up through 10.8100 at one stage. Similarly, the Kiwi was undermined by more signs of deteriorating NZ business morale and Nzd/Usd struggled to glean traction from a base very close to 0.6200 even though the Aud/Nzd cross drifted a bit further within 1.0805-1.0730 parameters. Back to Scandinavia, Eur/Nok also climbed further after a marked downturn in Norway’s manufacturing PMI, albeit still clinging to the 50.0 handle, with 9.9700 tested.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another major underperformer amidst more pressure on UK PM Johnson to deliver alternative arrangements for the Irish backstop and/or request another A 50 extension if the EU rejects what he believes to be a very good proposal, and with only a brief bounce on a better than forecast manufacturing PMI as the headline was boosted by no deal inventory/stock rebuilding. Cable only just held above 1.2200 and Eur/Gbp rebounded through 0.8900 more convincingly as the single currency proffered more from the Usd’s about turn following somewhat mixed Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, though still weak overall.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All ending volatile first trading sessions of October/Q4 ahead vs their US peer with the Yen back above its 100 DMA (107.80) having stemmed losses a few pips below 108.50, the Euro firmer over 1.0900 after another look at bids said to be positioned around 1.0880 and Franc bouncing strongly from sub-par through 0.9950 irrespective of disappointing Swiss retail sales and manufacturing PMI releases.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>A bad day for regional currencies in general as broadly weak manufacturing PMIs (Turkish aside) compounding more widespread risk-off sentiment as trouble in Hong Kong rumbled on and the aforementioned surveys merely added to concerns about the state of the global economy alongside other geopolitical tensions.</p>",

Key will be the forward-looking gauges, particularly new orders, which fell to 47.2 from 50.8 – ISM notes that a reading in this sub-index of above 52.5 is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders.</li><li>Last month's data showed prices rising a touch, to 46.0 from 45.1, though a price index above 52.5, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the BLS’ PPI measure for intermediate materials.</li><li>Monday’s Chicago PMI data printed below all analyst expectations, and Pantheon Macroeconomics note that \"the index tends to run a few points below the national ISM index, and the September reading is consistent with a modest increase in the ISM to about 50, from 49.1 in August,\". Looking ahead, Pantheon says that under normal circumstances, \"the rebound in China’s Caixin PMI would point clearly to a rebound in the Chicago PMI and ISM surveys, but the trade war has forced a substantial wedge between the state of China’s manufacturing business and that of its US equivalent.\"</li><li>Pantheon argues that it would be surprised to see substantial further downside in the US numbers, but a recovery does not seem to be in the cards yet, given the absence of any meaningful progress towards a trade deal, and the widening of the tariff net.</li><li>UBS, however, is going against the consensus, and see 49.5 from 50.9 due to weakness in Chicago manufacturing and Dallas Fed energy surveys, adding late-September factory surveys tended to be weaker than the early month surveys, auto strikes have slowed activity and difficulties at Boeing (BA) still consist.</li><li>United Auto Workers (UAW) at General Motors (GM) are currently in their third week of strikes as the company tries to negotiate new labour agreements for 46,000 full time factory workers; the longest strike at the company since 1970.</li><li><strong>Fed: </strong>With 7/17 members forecasting one more rate cut by the end of 2019, current market pricing for a 25bp cut at the October meeting is currently priced at ~39%, a poor reading with the second consecutive month may raise more concerns for the FOMC members who have constantly said they are data dependent and will see how the data comes in.</li><li>Of note, ISM state a reading of 42.9 generally shows an expansion&nbsp;</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona slumped in wake of a significantly weaker than forecast sub-50 manufacturing PMI that was compounded by a downward revision to the previous month, and its Scandinavian counterpart has fallen in sympathy as Norway’s manufacturing sector only just escaped contraction and decelerated sharply from almost 54.0 in August. Eur/Sek has tested 10.8000 following a breach of technical resistance circa 10.7742 and Eur/Nok rallied beyond 9.9550 from lows of around 9.9080 and just below 9.8850 at one stage on Monday.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar continues to prosper, partly at the expense of others, but also as US Treasury yields rebound and curves re-steepen with some extra impetus via Fed’s Evans advocating a policy pause after the 2 insurance cuts administered in July and September.

Elsewhere, the Loonie is still pivoting 1.3250 and awaiting Canadian GDP and/or Markit’s manufacturing PMI for extra inspiration, while the Yen appears more attuned to the latest gains in UST yields rather than a post-auction plunge in JGB futures that triggered emergency Japanese SCC margin calls. Indeed, Usd/Jpy has extended gains above 108.00 towards 108.50, with upside chart levels at 108.43 (Fib) and 108.48 (September’s peak) proving tough to break convincingly, thus far.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR -</strong> Relative G10 outperformers, or at least putting up a fight against the Greenback with the aid of an unexpected bounce in the UK manufacturing PMI and a steady pan Eurozone final print thanks to a German upgrade from the dire preliminary reading.

News flow on the Middle Eastern geopolitical front has been light, although reports that Iran has sentenced one person to death for spying for the US could be providing some support to the complex. However, further details regarding who the person is and what the wider implications, if any, may be are scant. Elsewhere, amid continued constructive risk tone and possible technical selling after it convincingly lost its grip on the USD 1500/oz handle yesterday, Gold continues to move lower. The fall in <strong>Gold </strong>prices comes despite continued escalations in protestor/police tensions in Hong Kong, as markets more broadly remain seemingly unperturbed by developments for now.

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>A lively start to the new month and Q4 amidst ongoing Greenback strength, but with independent weights exacerbating declines and underperformance. The Aussie rebounded initially after the RBA cut rates by a further 25 bp and inserted a relatively upbeat line in the accompanying statement about a gentle turning point in the economy, but with guidance for further easing retained recovery gains were short-lived and Aud/Usd subsequently slipped below 0.6700, while Aud/Nzd retreated from another test of resistance around 1.0800 even though the Kiwi eventually succumbed to contagion and Nzd/Usd reversed through 0.6250 again to a 0.6220 low following another downbeat NZ business sentiment survey overnight. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona slumped in wake of a significantly weaker than forecast sub-50 manufacturing PMI that was compounded by a downward revision to the previous month, and its Scandinavian counterpart has fallen in sympathy as Norway’s manufacturing sector only just escaped contraction and decelerated sharply from almost 54.0 in August. Eur/Sek has tested 10.8000 following a breach of technical resistance circa 10.7742 and Eur/Nok rallied beyond 9.9550 from lows of around 9.9080 and just below 9.8850 at one stage on Monday.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar continues to prosper, partly at the expense of others, but also as US Treasury yields rebound and curves re-steepen with some extra impetus via Fed’s Evans advocating a policy pause after the 2 insurance cuts administered in July and September. Accordingly, the <strong>DXY </strong>has forged a fresh ytd high and breached 99.500 in the process, at 99.590, eyeing the Markit PMI, ISM and more Fed speakers for further direction.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Franc has also bowed to disappointing Swiss macro news in the form of retail sales and deeper manufacturing PMI recession, with Usd/Chf up through parity and Eur/Chf crossing 1.0900 even though the single currency is struggling to cope with the aforementioned broad Buck advance and its own frailties. Elsewhere, the Loonie is still pivoting 1.3250 and awaiting Canadian GDP and/or Markit’s manufacturing PMI for extra inspiration, while the Yen appears more attuned to the latest gains in UST yields rather than a post-auction plunge in JGB futures that triggered emergency Japanese SCC margin calls. Indeed, Usd/Jpy has extended gains above 108.00 towards 108.50, with upside chart levels at 108.43 (Fib) and 108.48 (September’s peak) proving tough to break convincingly, thus far.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Relative G10 outperformers, or at least putting up a fight against the Greenback with the aid of an unexpected bounce in the UK manufacturing PMI and a steady pan Eurozone final print thanks to a German upgrade from the dire preliminary reading. However, Cable is still not making much headway beyond 1.2300 and Eur/Usd has waned just above 1.0900, with the former down through the 55 DMA (1.2279), Fib support (1.2271) and a late September base before the Brexit re-stocking PMI recovery and latter having another close look at bids at 1.0880 that are protecting a deeper retracement to 1.0864 (strong Fib support).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Blanket losses vs the Greenback, and with sub-50 manufacturing PMIs across the region, bar Turkey, not helping, as the Lira loses more ground amidst rebounding oil prices and further investor disenchantment with the Finance Minister’s latest grand economic plan.</p>",

EUR/USD meanders just below the 1.0900 mark whilst Cable hovered under 1.2300. Participants digested contradicting Brexit news-flow in which RTE’s leak of the UK non-paper was rebuffed by Sky sources, which stated that the UK has proposed a customs ‘mechanism’ whereby customs processes conducted at origin or destination of goods rather than “a string of inspection posts” on both sides of the Irish border. Furthermore, reports stated that senior UK judges are readying plans for an emergency legal challenge amid fears that PM Johnson will ignore the Benn Act and fails to seek a Brexit delay, whilst separate reports noted that the PM is poised to ask the EU to rule out further Article 50 extensions as part of a new deal. Elsewhere, the JPY succumbed to mild pressured from the Greenback with USD/JPY back above its 100 DMA (107.80) and north of the 108.00. Meanwhile, antipodeans are the marked underperformers with the NZD/USD retreating below 0.6250 as Business Confidence continues to deteriorate, whilst its Aussie counterpart awaits the RBA’s latest decision with money markets pricing in an 80%+ chance of a 25bps cut to the Cash Rate</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equities are higher after Wall Street wrapped up the third quarter with a session in the green ahead of principle-level US-Sino trade talks in Washington next week. In terms of Q3 performance, the S&amp;P and DJIA both advanced for a third consecutive quarter, rising over 1% each, whilst the Nasdaq dipped 0.1% Q/Q. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is the underperformer as base and precious metal miners bear the brunt of softer prices, whilst Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) cheers favourable currency moves as the region side-lined the planned sales tax hike which came into effect today. Elsewhere, the KOSPI (+0.6%) conformed to the risk appetite despite South Korean exports declining for the tenth straight month and semi-conductor exports slumped 31.5% Y/Y, albeit inflation metric fell short of forecasts. As a reminder, Mainland China and Hong Kong markets are closed due to National Day Holiday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, DXY eclipsed YTD highs as a new month and quarter commences and ahead of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI, which is expected to signal a recovery. EUR/USD and GBP/USD were modestly pressured by the firmer Greenback, albeit the pairs remained within yesterday’s ranges. EUR/USD meanders just below the 1.0900 mark whilst Cable hovered under 1.2300. Participants digested contradicting Brexit news-flow in which RTE’s leak of the UK non-paper was rebuffed by Sky sources, which stated that the UK has proposed a customs ‘mechanism’ whereby customs processes conducted at origin or destination of goods rather than “a string of inspection posts” on both sides of the Irish border. Furthermore, reports stated that senior UK judges are readying plans for an emergency legal challenge amid fears that PM Johnson will ignore the Benn Act and fails to seek a Brexit delay, whilst separate reports noted that the PM is poised to ask the EU to rule out further Article 50 extensions as part of a new deal. Elsewhere, the JPY succumbed to mild pressured from the Greenback with USD/JPY back above its 100 DMA (107.80) and north of the 108.00. Meanwhile, antipodeans are the marked underperformers with the NZD/USD retreating below 0.6250 as Business Confidence continues to deteriorate, whilst its Aussie counterpart awaits the RBA’s latest decision with money markets pricing in an 80%+ chance of a 25bps cut to the Cash Rate</p>",
