Furthermore, its forecasts for the longer run showed GDP Growth 1.9% vs. prev. 1.9%, jobless rate 4.3% vs. prev. 4.4%, PCE Price Index 2.0% vs. prev. 2.0%.</p><p>Fed said it is to slow reduction of holdings beginning in May by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from USD 30bln to USD 15bln and conclude runoff in September, while it is to continue to reinvest agency debt and MBS debt into treasuries starting in Oct. and with a maximum amount of USD 20bln/month. Fed also said it is to hold asset portfolio roughly constant for a time with gradual increases in some liabilities offset by declines in reserves and will provide more details in May.</p><p>Fed's Powell said it could be some time before the outlook calls for a change in policy and that the policy rate is in the range of neutral, while he suggested that data doesn't send a direction in which Fed policy should move. Powell also commented that the Fed will soon turn to decision on composition of balance sheet, that the balance sheet may still be above what is needed for efficient policy in September and will make additional changes to balance sheet plans if needed.

General Mills (GIS) surged after beating top and bottom estimates and optimistic guidance. Energy names (DVN, EOG, PXD) traded higher on rising crude prices from bullish inventory data.

The Fed intends to have the balance sheet primarily consisting of Tsys after it has concluded BSN, and Powell sees the size at just over USD 3.5trln (around 17% of GDP vs around 25% at its peak).

The trajectory of rate hikes was narrowed, as expected, with the central bank now seeing no rate hikes in 2019, and one in 2020 (it previously saw three hikes over its horizon); it left the neutral rate estimate at 2.8%. Forecasts also showed the Fed sees weaker near-term economic growth and tamer inflation conditions when compared with December. The Fed also stated that it will slow the balance sheet run-off beginning in May and ending in September, adding that it would reduce the cap on monthly redemptions to USD 15bln (Prev. 30bln), and reinvest MBS coupons into Treasury holdings, starting in October; the Fed said it would provide more details in May.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESSER: </strong>The Fed Chair began reiterating patience ('no need to rush to judgement') and the 'wait and see' approach, though still sounded relatively upbeat about the economy ('The Fed's outlook is a positive one' and 'underlying economic fundamentals are still strong'), while noting international risks (trade, Brexit, China, Europe - although he notes China is stabilising, and he does not foresee a recession in Europe). Powell said it could be some time before the outlook calls for a change in policy. On the balance sheet, Powell said that reserve balances in September might still be above what is required for the efficient delivery of monetary policy, and the Fed could still tweak the BSN plan, if conditions warrant. Powell did disclose that the balance sheet's size will be approximately 17% of GDP by the end of this year at a bit above USD 3.5trln (vs around 25% of GDP at its peak near the end of 2014); on its composition, the Fed chair said the FOMC's decision will turn to that shortly. Powell said financial conditions are more accommodative now than a few months ago. Tariffs got another mention, and the Fed chair said for the US economy, he was hearing concerns about tariffs, but it was hard to say how much of an impact this was having. It was interesting that Powell said that rates are in the range of neutral, despite the median dot being unchanged at 2.8% (two 25bps hikes away from the current FFR target). Powell continued on his inflation views that he made a couple of weeks ago, arguing that the Fed has not achieved its objective, and that is another reason why it is being patient. On the yield curve, Powell was asked whether the Fed is trying to flatten the yield curve, to which he replied 'no'. Net/net, the reaction was distinctly dovish, with money markets now pricing the possibility of a rate cut in 2019 at just under 40% vs around 25% on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Focus today turned to the Article 50 extension, wherein UK PM May asked for a \"short” extension to June 30th. Whilst there was some short-lived rumbling about the letter from PM May to the EU arriving “too late” to give the EU time make a decision this week at the upcoming summit, this was all but refuted by EU’s Tusk, who stated that a short A50 extension would be possible, conditional on the support of the House of Commons. The positing of a June 30th exit date was digested as pushing a larger divide between the UK and the EU, a fact confirmed by the spokesperson for EU’s Juncker who said UK PM May was warned against including a date for the extension that is after the European Parliamentary Elections, with the EC President reaffirming a delay to May 23rd is more viable as it avoids “legal and political difficulties”. The growing division between the UK and EU on extension lengths, and indeed more fractures in Parliament (as evidenced by the emergency debate on the rationale behind A50 extension (SO24)) saw GBP as today’s marked underperformer ahead of the Fed rate decision.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Risk sentiment was soured in early Wednesday trade on Tuesday's reports, which essentially suggested that talks with China were challenging. Ahead of next week's visit of the USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to Beijing for further talks, US President Trump said that he is talking with officials about leaving tariffs on China for a long period of time, though he did say talks were coming along with China. On auto tariffs, Trump said there is no recommendations and it is up for review; the EU has previously said there would be retaliatory actions made if the US were to implement tariffs on its key auto sector.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 0.80 HIGHER AT USD 59.83/BBL; BRENT (K9) SETTLES USD 0.89 HIGHER AT USD 68.50/BBL. </strong>Crude<strong> </strong>prices<strong> </strong>got off on the back-foot, taking cues from cautious European markets, before reversing course to push to YTD highs on another bullish inventory data release. The EIA reported crude stocks drawing a whopping 9.6mln bbls, a surprise from the expected build and well exceeding the API’s 2.1mln draw reported on Tuesday evening, which the market took in its stride to push WTI above the USD 60 handle; the move was also supported by the products both drawing more than 4mln bbls each, larger draws than expected; the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub reported a second consecutive drawdown in stocks too; production edged back to record highs from 12mln BPD to 12.1mln BPD. It is worth noting that the WTI term structure is currently in contango up until the September contract, however this has been narrowing recently as drawing inventories has elevated short-term supply concerns and raised the price for front-month contract deliveries; the market appears to be warming to producers, where as it had previously been punishing producers - particularly shale - for over-supply. Elsewhere, UAE Energy Minister Al-Mazrouei said the OPEC member was committed to delivering 100% of its supply cuts in the coming months, adding that he expects OPEC to finalise a charter with Non-OPEC in the same time frame too; he caveated the comments by saying that cuts would continue provided that inventories remain above the 5-year average.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: Bank of England Monetary Policy Decision and Minutes Thursday 21st March 12:00GMT (08:00EDT)</strong> • MPC expected to vote 9-0 in favour of standing pat on rates at 0.75% • Brexit uncertainty likely to tie the hands of policymakers • Markets looking to see if political jitters will impact the MPC’s current rate outlook. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21420/download\">Click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: Swiss National Bank policy meeting (March 2019) </strong>SNB seen standing pat on policy; following a dovish ECB, the risks are tilted towards dovish commentary from the SNB,<strong> </strong>whose normalisation timeline has likely been pushed back as well.

Mild inflation, political stability and domestic reforms give the BCB reason to stand pat on policy. At 3.9% YY, inflation is running beneath the BCB's 4.25% end-2019 target; Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks modest demand growth, a shrinking but still ample output gap, combined with a high rate unemployment at 12.0% will keep price pressures tame this year. Weekly central bank surveys have also showed growth expectations have also been weakening since mid-Feb. The BRL's stability since Q4 2018 has not stoked inflationary concerns; however, if there was going to be any near-term stoking of price pressures, BRL weakness would likely be the source. Gradual progress being made with fiscal reform has kept BRL volatility at bay, but Pantheon suggests that this may soon change due to 1) the challenging timetable to pass pension reform ahead of the mid-year recess in July, and 2) when reform discussions turns towards social security.</strong></p><p><strong>* SPX -0.29% at 2824, NDX +0.43% at 7381, DJI -0.55% at 25745.

Viacom (VIAB) nosedived on fears it will pull its channels from AT&amp;T’s (T) DirecTV service as the two co.s struggle to reach a licensing agreement ahead of Friday’s deadline; Discovery (DISCA), who is another DirecTV content provider and a potential merger for Viacom also traded lower. General Mills (GIS) surged after beating top and bottom estimates and optimistic guidance. Energy names (DVN, EOG, PXD) traded higher on rising crude prices from bullish inventory data. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) underperformed following a warning being sent to it from the FDA for failing to comply with post-approval study requirements. Boeing (BA) found some relief from Berenberg saying the aerospace co. is “too big to fail”. Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) caught a bid after the FDA approved its postpartum depression treatment. Monster beverage (MNST) suffered from a downgrade at Goldman, where it was removed from its “Americas Conviction List”.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 20+ TICKS HIGHER AT 123-13. </strong>Treasury yields dropped to a 14-month low after a dovish Fed signalled no further hikes in 2019 (just one rate hike is seen on the forecast horizon vs three previously), while also confirming a halt to its balance sheet run-off, starting May ending September, with maturing MBS coupons to be reinvested into Treasury holdings. The Fed intends to have the balance sheet primarily consisting of Tsys after it has concluded BSN, and Powell sees the size at just over USD 3.5trln (around 17% of GDP vs around 25% at its peak). Yields on 2-year notes fell beneath 2.40% (the effective FFR rate in recent weeks), while yields on 10s fell to a 14-month low above 2.5%. Curve spreads were mixed after the Fed, with shorter spreads flattening (2s5s and 2s10s came in by around 1bps), while the 2s30s and 5s30s bull steepened by around 2.5bps and 4bps respectively.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The buck fell to lows last seen in January on a dovish Fed, which supported the EMFX complex, including the BRL, whose central bank reports after market (mild inflation, political stability and domestic reforms give the BCB reason to stand pat on policy); even the ZAR jumped against the buck, despite continuing woes regarding load shedding. It helped to push the EUR above 1.14, where it has found the air thin, of late. GBP , meanwhile, continues to be whipped around on Brexit headlines; PM May is to speak from Downing Street at 2015 GMT (1615 EDT), where she is expected to outline the reasons why she requested an A50 process extension through 30/June; some also suggest she may threaten a General Election if lawmakers fail to back her deal at a Meaningful Vote next week, while others have speculated that she may present her resignation in an effort to gain support of the bellicose ERG, who have been making murmurs to derail her plans once again. The Aussie was boosted on a weaker dollar, and seems to be becoming comfortable at levels 0.71; but with that said, the Aussie could not overcome JPY strength, and the carry favourite AUDJPY traded lower - carry has been a strategy FX traders have been using this year, and the expectation is that falling volatility, rising stocks may provide a favourable background for the strategy, which could lend some appeal to the G10 high yielders. XAU was one of the major beneficiaries of the dovish Fed, printing highs above USD 1315.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It helped to push the EUR above 1.14, where it has found the air thin, of late. GBP , meaninwhile, continues to be whipped around on Brexit headlines; PM May is to speak from Downing Street at 2015 GMT (1615 EDT), where she is expected to outline the reasons why she requested an A50 process extension through 30/June; some also suggest she may threaten a General Election if lawmakers fail to back her deal at a Meaningful Vote next week, while others have speculated that she may present her resignation in an effort to gain support of the bellicose ERG, who have been making murmurs to derail her plans once again. The Aussie was boosted on a weaker dollar, and seems to be becoming comfortable at levels 0.71; but with that said, the Aussie could not overcome JPY strength, and the carry favourite AUDJPY traded lower - carry has been a strategy FX traders have been using this year, and the expectation is that falling volatility, rising stocks may provide a favourable background for the strategy, which could lend some appeal to the G10 high yielders. XAU was one of the major beneficiaries of the dovish Fed, printing highs above USD 1315.</p>",

At 3.9% YY, inflation is running beneath the BCB's 4.25% end-2019 target; Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks modest demand growth, a shrinking but still ample output gap, combined with a high rate unemployment at 12.0% will keep price pressures tame this year. Weekly central bank surveys have also showed growth expectations have also been weakening since mid-Feb. The BRL's stability since Q4 2018 has not stoked inflationary concerns; however, if there was going to be any near-term stoking of price pressures, BRL weakness would likely be the source. Gradual progress being made with fiscal reform has kept BRL volatility at bay, but Pantheon suggests that this may soon change due to 1) the challenging timetable to pass pension reform ahead of the mid-year recess in July, and 2) when reform discussions turns towards social security.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* FOMC RATE DECISION/STATEMENT: </strong>The Fed kept rates unchanged at 2.25-2.50%, as expected. The trajectory of rate hikes was narrowed, as expected, with the central bank now seeing no rate hikes in 2019, and one in 2020 (it previously saw three hikes over its horizon); it left the neutral rate estimate at 2.8%. Forecasts also showed the Fed sees weaker near-term economic growth and tamer inflation conditions when compared with December. The Fed also stated that it will slow the balance sheet run-off beginning in May and ending in September, adding that it would reduce the cap on monthly redemptions to USD 15bln (Prev. 30bln), and reinvest MBS coupons into Treasury holdings, starting in October; the Fed said it would provide more details in May. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESSER: </strong>The Fed Chair began reiterating patience ('no need to rush to judgement') and the 'wait and see' approach, though still sounded relatively upbeat about the economy ('The Fed's outlook is a positive one' and 'underlying economic fundamentals are still strong'), while noting international risks (trade, Brexit, China, Europe - although he notes China is stabilising, and he does not foresee a recession in Europe). Powell said it could be some time before the outlook calls for a change in policy. On the balance sheet, Powell said that reserve balances in September might still be above what is required for the efficient delivery of monetary policy, and the Fed could still tweak the BSN plan, if conditions warrant. Powell did disclose that the balance sheet's size will be approximately 17% of GDP by the end of this year at a bit above USD 3.5trln (vs around 25% of GDP at its peak near the end of 2014); on its composition, the Fed chair said the FOMC's decision will turn to that shortly. Powell said financial conditions are more accommodative now than a few months ago. Tariffs got another mention, and the Fed chair said for the US economy, he was hearing concerns about tariffs, but it was hard to say how much of an impact this was having. It was interesting that Powell said that rates are in the range of neutral, despite the median dot being unchanged at 2.8% (two 25bps hikes away from the current FFR target). Powell continued on his inflation views that he made a couple of weeks ago,arguing that the Fed has not achieved its objective, and that is another reason why it is being patient. On the yield curve, Powell was asked whether the Fed is trying to flatten the yield curve, to which he replied 'no'. Net/net, the reaction was distinctly dovish, with money markets now pricing the possibility of a rate cut in 2019 at just under 40% vs around 25% on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>",

The EIA reported crude stocks drawing a whopping 9.6mln bbls, a surprise from the expected build and well exceeding the API’s 2.1mln draw reported on Tuesday evening, which the market took in its stride to push WTI above the USD 60 handle; the move was also supported by the products both drawing more than 4mln bbls each, larger draws than expected; the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub reported a second consecutive drawdown in stocks too; production edged back to record highs from 12mln BPD to 12.1mln BPD. It is worth noting that the WTI term structure is currently in contango up until the September contract, however this has been narrowing recently as drawing inventories has elevated short-term supply concerns and raised the price for front-month contract deliveries; the market appears to be warming to producers, where as it had previously been punishing producers - particularly shale - for over-supply. Elsewhere, UAE Energy Minister Al-Mazrouei said the OPEC member was committed to delivering 100% of its supply cuts in the coming months, adding that he expects OPEC to finalise a charter with Non-OPEC in the same time frame too; he caveated the comments by saying that cuts would continue provided that inventories remain above the 5-year average.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>It may yet become a Dollar story once the FOMC reveals its March policy decisions, but the midweek session has been all about the plight of the Pound thus far, for major currencies at least. Cable has pared some losses and Eur/Gbp a portion of its gains, but Sterling remains the clear G10 underperformer after losing 20 DMA support vs the Dollar at 1.3201, then 1.3200 and 1.3160 (Fib retracement level) on its way through a few 1.3150 stops before finding a base. The catalyst, UK PM May’s decision to seek a short 90 day extension to the March 29 Brexit deadline rather than a longer delay, albeit coerced by Tory Brexiteers, and the EU effectively denying the request before official consideration during Thursday-Friday’s Summit on the grounds that it is legally and politically tough to approve (given upcoming EU elections). Alternatively, a delay until May 23 or the end of the year is viable, according to Brussels. Meanwhile, divisions within Whitehall appear to be growing and after a feisty PMQs the House Speaker has agreed to a motion for an emergency Parliament debate (S024) on the rationale for requesting an Article 50 adjournment. This will start shortly (15.20GMT), and reports have been circulating that the PM will deliver a statement outside number 10, perhaps after, before or instead of an anticipated meeting with the ERG that was pencilled in for 17.00GMT. Note, however, other media sources say that Downing Street has denied such rumours, but EC President Tusk is expected to issue a statement at 16.00GMT after receiving the A 50 extension letter from May.</p><p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling woes aside, the index has managed to find a base ahead of the Fed, even though other Usd/G10 pairs are narrowly mixed. The DXY is just about holding within a 96.360-571 range with underlying support ahead of 96.000 in the form of a 96.264 Fib, but the next major driver and directional input widely anticipated to come via the FOMC – see our Research Suite for a detailed primer of the release, SEP and post-meeting press conference from Chair Powell.</p><p><strong>CHF/AUD/EUR</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Greenback, and especially the Franc that has extended recovery gains on Brexit-related safe-haven positioning to 0.9970 and towards 1.1320 against the single currency, just in time for the SNB to remind markets that the Swiss unit remains highly valued or a variation of too strong in essence – full preview also available via Ransquawk’s Research Suite. Meanwhile, the Aussie is still keeping tabs on 0.7100 ahead of jobs data overnight, while the Euro has edged a bit further above the 1.1350 axis that has been prevalent so far this week (if not longer) and closer to Fib resistance at 1.1374.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>The major laggards, in name not margins vs the Buck, as the Loonie sits halfway between 1.3315-50 parameters against the backdrop of rebounding oil prices, while Usd/Jpy continues to straddle 111.50, albeit within a higher range than of late on divergent UST/JGB yields and Fed/BoJ outlooks. Lastly, the Kiwi is trading defensively below 0.6850 and sub-1.0350 vs its Antipodean counterpart eyeing NZ Q4 GDP later that could disappoint compared to median expectations.</p>",

Meanwhile in the equity space, the German bourse is the clear underperformer on some stock specific negatives, namely Bayer and BMW, with Bunds a beneficiary when rebounding to register a fresh Eurex peak at 164.18 (+22 vs -12 ticks at one stage), but the core Eurozone bond still lagging well behind Gilts that blasted through upside chart obstacles to reach 127.61 and within touching distance of the 127.68 mid-February contract best.</p>",

Underperformance in the Dax was seen at the open following Bayer (-12.5%) opening significantly lower following a US Jury ruling that the Co’s Roundup was a ‘substantial factor’ in causing a man’s cancer, for reference the Co. has around a 8.3% DAX weighting. Losses in the Dax were subsequently exacerbated by BMW (-4.8%) reporting that they see 2019 group profit before tax significantly lower than the prior years levels; other German names have been dragged down in sympathy. In terms of sectors the material sector continues to underperform, after opening lower than peers at the open, which has been attributed by some to a potential easing of supply constraints after Vale surpassed a milestone in their path to resume production at their Brucutu, Brazil mine.

Note, Germany’s Bobl sale was satisfactory rather than solid and has resulted in marginal belly indigestion. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are moderately above parity and curve flatter with all eyes on the eagerly awaited FOMC, but also an element of safe-haven/risk aversion in the mix as some EU equities extend losses, and the German Dax especially.</p>",

The DXY is back within touching distance of the 96.500 level having stopped the rot just ahead of Fib support at 96.264, but it remains to be seen whether the index closes above another chart retracement level at 96.434, which did not hold yesterday, and this in turn depends on how dovish the FOMC proves to be via a combination of the revised growth and inflation forecasts, updated dot plots and especially QT guidance – for a full preview of the looming and pivotal event check out the Ransquawk Research Suite.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to the Buck’s resolve, Sterling seems resigned to heightened Brexit risk, and in particular the increased uncertainty that extending the A 50 deadline might bring, assuming the EU accepts the request of course. Latest reports suggest that PM May will ask for a short delay of up to June 30 after discussing the alternative of a longer postponement from March 29 with her Cabinet, but meeting staunch opposition to the latter from Tory Leave rebels. However, Brussels remains adamant that any request will only be considered, let alone granted, if accompanied by a rationale reason or firm plan of action, while stressing no going back to the table and renegotiating the WA. Moreover, a 3 month extension crosses the EU election deadline and event itself, as the deadline falls on April 12 for May 23. Cable has accordingly recoiled from another approach towards 1.3300, stopping just short of 1.3200, and Eur/Gbp is hovering near the top of a 0.8590-50 range.</p><p><strong>G10&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Elsewhere, Usd/majors remain relatively rangebound and narrowly mixed, with the <strong>AUD, CHF </strong>and <strong>EUR </strong>marginally outperforming vs the <strong>JPY, CAD </strong>and<strong> NZD </strong>that are on a moderately softer footing vs the Dollar. Aud/Usd is holding close to 0.7100, and gleaning some support from the Kiwi on cross-positioning as Aud/Nzd climbs back above 1.0350 and Nzd/Usd is capped ahead of 0.6850 in advance of NZ Q4 GDP data that is likely to carry downside risks vs consensus. Usd/Jpy is pivoting 111.50 after more dovish leaning Japanese rhetoric from BoJ Governor Kuroda and the Government, while the Loonie has lost Tuesday’s bullish momentum and retreated further from 1.3250 to almost 1.3350 alongside crude prices. Turning to the single currency and Franc, trading parameters are still extremely tight around parity and 1.1350 respectively, with the Chf not just wary of the FOMC, but also the SNB on Thursday, while Eur/Usd does not seem likely to trigger decent option expiries at 1.1320-35 (1 bn) or 1.1390-1.1400 (2 bn) at this stage.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets lacked firm direction with the region cautious following a lacklustre lead from Wall St and as global risk appetite was hampered by the looming FOMC meeting and ongoing US-China trade uncertainty. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) traded mixed in which the former was pressured by weakness in financials and mining names, while Sony and Nintendo shares were among the biggest decliners in Japan following Google’s announcement of a cloud-based gaming service, although losses in the broader Tokyo market were later pared by favourable currency moves. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) conformed to the indecisive tone due to trade uncertainty following conflicting news flow in which US-China trade talks were said to be at the final stages with senior trade negotiators to meet from next week, although other reports noted expectations that China may walk back on some trade offers and that issues remained regarding data services and pharma. Finally, 10yr JGBs were restrained as they reflected the flat picture in T-notes and uneventful BoJ Minutes release, although prices were then pressured as Tokyo trade began to improve and following a tepid BoJ Rinban operation of JPY 500bln concentrated in the belly.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets lack firm direction with the region cautious following a lacklustre lead from Wall St and as global risk appetite is hampered by the looming FOMC meeting and ongoing US-China trade uncertainty. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) are mixed with the former pressured by weakness in financials and mining names, while Sony and Nintendo shares are among the biggest decliners in Japan following Google’s announcement of a cloud-based gaming service, although losses in the broader Tokyo market were later pared by favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) conform to the indecisive tone due to trade uncertainty following conflicting trade-related news flow in which US-China trade talks were said to be at the final stages with senior trade negotiators to meet from next week, although other reports noted expectations that China may walk back on some trade offers and that issues remained regarding data services and pharma.</p><p>Price moves across FX markets have been relatively tame overnight with the greenback attempting to recover above the 96.50 level amid some pre-FOMC positioning and with some said to question the consensus for a dovish Fed. The greenback’s major counterparts are rangebound with EUR/USD and GBP/USD at the mid-1.13 and 1.32 handles respectively, with the latter consolidating ahead of a potential bout of more Brexit-related swings as PM May is indicated to send her Brexit extension letter to the EU today, although there is uncertainty on the length of the extension request and some Tory MP's reportedly warned a forced resignation as the price if UK PM May succeeds in seeking a long Brexit delay. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have found support on a slight improvement in Japanese sentiment and touted Gotobi demand, while antipodeans are mildly pressured with AUD/USD retreating further away from the 0.7100 handle as 3yr yields slipped back below the 1.50% Cash Rate Target.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with prices reflecting the flat picture in T-notes and with the impact of the indecisive risk sentiment offset by a tepid BoJ Rinban announcement of JPY 500bln concentrated in the belly.</p>",
