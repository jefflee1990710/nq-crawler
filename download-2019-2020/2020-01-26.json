American Express (AXP) was another top Dow performer after beating top and bottom, helped by allow tax rate, in addition to firm guidance. Boeing (BA) reversed its losses after the FAA suggested that mid-year 737 MAX approval timeline was “conservative”. Broadcom (AVGO) made solid gains after it entered a multi-year supply contract with Apple (AAPL), leading to losses in Skyworks (SWKS) as pessimism grew on how much iPhone-related business it can now tap.

The move higher in the T-Note coincided with Spoos being offered (falling beneath 3200) in the latter part of the European session, the move lower in yields was exacerbated following the US PMIs, which were by no means disastrous, appeared more of an obstacle for participants to get out the way before moving into Treasuries ahead of the weekend – where concerns linger on the threats posed globally by the coronavirus. Note that some heavy block trades were noted after the T-Note passed the 130-00 level; some analysts note a slew of short covering as prices move closer to concentrated option strikes, specifically 130-16 and 130-25, although the key 1.67% figure in the 10-year yield served as resistance for the benchmark, but loomed close in the tail end of the day. By settlement, the Treasury curve had bull-flattened, where the 2s10s fell just beneath the 20bps figure: 2-year yield down 2bps and 10-year yield down 5bps. US T-note futures (H0) settled 16 ticks higher at 130-09.</p>",
