Powell also stated that many participants cited weaker business investment and cross currents as the reason for cuts, while participants also anticipate inflation moving to the target more slowly than expected although he reverted back to the “monitoring” language when explicitly asked about whether the Fed would cut at the upcoming meeting.

The near-end of the Treasury yield curve saw further lows (2s see a 1.5yr low, 3s nearly a 20-month low), though the 10-year note again is clinging to a 2-handle at settlement, though it is only a couple of basis points from going under 2%. At settlement, 2s30s was nearly 8bps wider. In terms of pricing for Fed cuts, 29.5bps of cuts has been priced for July (vs 24.9bps prior to today's rate decision); by end 2019, 71.5bps of cuts are priced (vs 60.5bps before the rate decision).

It downgraded its assessment of economic activity to “moderate” from “solid” previously. It also noted that “uncertainties about the outlook have increased” and the FOMC will “closely monitor” developments, and removed its pledge to be “patient” as it determined the appropriateness of rates. Analysts have immediately taken the latest tweaks as a sign that the FOMC has opened the door to future rate cuts, if required. In the aftermath, risk assets rallied in a manner consistent with a loosening of financial conditions (stocks up, yields down, dollar down, while gold rallied). During the press conference, Powell noted that even among the participants who did not see rate cuts, the case for accommodation was stronger now than in the previous meeting. Powell was explicitly asked about whether the Fed would cut at the upcoming meeting, and Powell reverted back to the “monitoring” language, suggesting that the Committee will be taking a wait and see approach, and the rate decision will hinge on the outcome of trade talks. However, Powell was asked whether a trade deal between US/China would diminish the case for cuts, and he stated that the Fed does not just monitor one development, citing global growth as another factor that the Fed is cognizant of, as well as inflation and jobs growth. Powell reiterated the Fed’s readiness to act promptly, if needed, to sustain the economic expansion. On the increment of future rate cuts, Powell said that the FOMC had not yet engaged with the question of whether it should be 25bps or 50bps, reverting back to incoming data, and how overall risks evolve. Powell was asked about the risks of waiting too long, but does not feel these risks are prominent now. On inflation (PCE inflation forecast cut to 1.5% form 1.8%), Powell said that fall in breakeven rates was a factor that boosted the case for rate cuts, arguing that the Fed does not want to be seen as weak on inflation. Regarding the balance sheet, Powell said that the run-off is close to the end of its planned life; if the Fed were to provide more accommodation, it would be willing to adjust balance sheet policy. On political influence, Powell firmly stated that he fully intends to serve his four-year term. However, soon after the conclusion of the FOMC presser, CNBC’s Gasparino hinted that US President Trump will try to remove him if he does a 180 on rates, citing people close to the President.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>There were further positive signs that US and Chinese policymakers are making progress ahead of the G20 meeting on 28-29th June, where Presidents Xi and Trump will have an extended meeting in an effort to get trade talks back on track. USTR Lighthizer is set to have a telephone conversation with his Chinese counterpart, and said it was in the interest of both the US and China to have successful talks. Lighthizer’s comments did not make clear when negotiations will formerly restart. CNBC, citing analysts with ties to the Chinese government, said that there is a view that US President Donald Trump is ready to move toward an agreement. There was a more circumspect approach in China, where an editorial in SCMP stated that a quick resolution between the two sides was unlikely at the G20, with complex issues such as North Korea, Iran and Huawei also on the agenda. China Global Times Editor was also sceptical, asking \"are China and the US set to have new decisive negotiations? People around me and myself are less optimistic than we were when two leaders met last December.\" He also said he believes Trump's call is a result of fight of Chinese side and more battles may be needed for making the US (act) fairer. In early trade, it was reported that China’s MOFCOM has today launched an anti-dumping investigation into some rubber products from South Korea, EU and the US.</p><p><strong>* CANADA CPI: </strong>An upside surprise, which saw the headline YY rate accelerate to 2.4% from 2.0% (exp. 2.1%), and the core Y/Y rate rise to 2.1% from 1.5%. An average of the three BOC core measures rose to 2.06% from 1.90% in the previous report. Headline inflation, therefore, rises above the BOC’s target for the first time since last October. “This should provide the Bank some comfort with its current policy stance and allow them to push back against market pricing for cuts,” TD Securities said, “however, any potential rate hikes are still a long-ways off, with a number of obstacles to clear beforehand.” TD adds that “this will undoubtedly add to the evolving BOC narrative of things ‘looking up’ and hence, some CAD optimism. However, the hurdle is high for us to clear this mark in our view, and we require a material pick-up in activity data and reduced threat of easing (in the Fed as well as the BOC) to validate that sentiment.”</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N9) SETTLE USD 0.14 LOWER AT USD 53.76/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (Q9) SETTLE USD 0.32 LOWER AT USD 61.82/BBL:</strong> Crude markets drifted lower through the session, relatively unphased by the FOMC and experiencing some volatility from a bullish inventory report. There was a short-lived spike on the release of the EIA US inventory data, which saw crude stocks draw 3.1mln bbls, larger than the expected 1.1mln bbl draw, as well as the 0.8mln bbl draw provided by the API; Cushing stocks built by 0.64mln bbls. In the products, both gasoline and distillates printed surprise draws of 1.7mln bbls and 0.55mln bbls respectively. Elsewhere, OPEC+ have struck and agreement to hold its upcoming meeting on July 1st-2nd (OPEC July 1st, OPEC+ July 2nd). OPEC sources later suggested that future meetings and decisions may be even more fraught amid the conflict among the producers; While not necessarily new or surprising, it does highlight the difficulty on the agreement of production cuts, particularly raised cuts or extended cuts into 2020.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 127-27+: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-steepened after a dovish FOMC meeting, where the Fed held rates though tweaked its guidance in a dovish manner, and reiterated a willingness to act if the situation required. The near-end of the Treasury yield curve saw further lows (2s see a 1.5yr low, 3s nearly a 20-month low), though the 10-year note again is clinging to a 2-handle at settlement, though it is only a couple of basis points from going under 2%. At settlement, 2s30s was nearly 8bps wider. In terms of pricing for Fed cuts, 29.5bps of cuts has been priced for July (vs 24.9bps prior to today's rate decision); by end 2019, 71.5bps of cuts are priced (vs 60.5bps before the rate decision).</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 2926, NASDAQ-100 0.4% at 7668, Dow Jones 0.2% at 26504, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, Consumer Staples 0.4%, Energy -0.2%, Financials -0.2%, Health Care 1%, Industrials 0%, Information Technology 0.4%, Materials -0.5%, Telecommunication Services 0.2%, Utilities 0.8%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) opened higher on reports that it has asked major suppliers to look into the potential costs of moving 15%-30% of production capacity away from China towards Southeast Asia, as the iPhone maker prepares to restructure its supply chain. Boeing (BA) received a large number of orders for its aircrafts, including for the grounded 737 MAX, at the Paris Air Show. Merck (MRK) edged higher on reports the drug maker is looking to secure small and midsize deals, which are primarily aimed at a further expansion of its portfolio of cancer treatments. Adobe (ADBE) shot higher on earnings that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, shrugging off weaker EPS guidance. Amazon (AMZN) is looking to add a number of smaller aircraft to its rental fleet, as the ecommerce giant looks to expand its next-day delivery capacity. FedEx (FDX) moved lower, having recently opted to end its shipping agreement with Amazon, in order to focus on other retailers. Facebook (FB) opened red after US House Banking Chair Waters requested it halt development of its new Libra cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators can review it. TripAdvisor (TRIP) caught a bid after it was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Suntrust. American Express (AXP) jumped higher pre-market after the payments co. received an upgrade from BAML, with Mastercard (MA) moving higher in sympathy, quite possibly due to the positive industry trends cited by the broker. Allergan (AGN) and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals (IRWD) both jumped higher up as their LIZNESS drug met primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial. CBS Corp (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) both moved higher on the news that the former may make an offer within the next few weeks. Axalta (AXTA) surged on reports the co. is looking to explore a potential sale. Redhat (RHT) shot higher after the co.’s merger with IBM was approved by EU regulators.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>moved lower after the Fed opted to hold rates but made substantial dovish tweaks to its statement, whilst the dot plot indicated that 7 voters were calling for 2 rate cuts in 2019 (although the median for 2019 was still to hold rates); with DXY bottoming out at 97.10<i>.</i> <strong>EUR</strong> erased yesterday’s post Draghi losses, with EURUSD<strong> </strong>making fresh weekly highs at 1.1254 in the aftermath of the FOMC.

        "analysis_details": "<p>During the press conference, Powell noted that even among the participants who did not see rate cuts, the case for accommodation was stronger now than in the previous meeting. Powell was explicitly asked about whether the Fed would cut at the upcoming meeting, and Powell reverted back to the “monitoring” language, suggesting that the Committee will be taking a wait and see approach, and the rate decision will hinge on the outcome of trade talks. However, Powell was asked whether a trade deal between US/China would diminish the case for cuts, and he stated that the Fed does not just monitor one development, citing global growth as another factor that the Fed is cognizant of, as well as inflation and jobs growth. Powell reiterated the Fed’s readiness to act promptly, if needed, to sustain the economic expansion. On the increment of future rate cuts, Powell said that the FOMC had not yet engaged with the question of whether it should be 25bps or 50bps, reverting back to incoming data, and how overall risks evolve. Powell was asked about the risks of waiting too long, but does not feel these risks are prominent now. On inflation (PCE inflation forecast cut to 1.5% form 1.8%), Powell said that fall in breakeven rates was a factor that boosted the case for rate cuts, arguing that the Fed does not want to be seen as weak on inflation.<strong> </strong>Regarding the balance sheet, Powell said that the run-off is close to the end of its planned life; if the Fed were to provide more accommodation, it would be willing to adjust balance sheet policy.<strong> </strong>On political influence, Powell firmly stated that he fully intends to serve his four-year term.</p>",

In the products, both gasoline and distillates printed surprise draws of 1.7mln bbls and 0.55mln bbls respectively. Elsewhere, OPEC+ have struck and agreement to hold their upcoming meeting on July 1st-2nd (OPEC July 1st, OPEC+ July 2nd). OPEC sources later suggested that future meetings and decisions may be even more fraught amid the conflict among the producers; While not necessarily new or surprising, it does highlight the difficulty on the agreement of production cuts, particularly raised cuts or extended cuts into 2020.</p>",

It downgraded its assessment of economic activity to “moderate” from “solid” previously. It also noted that “uncertainties about the outlook have increased” and the FOMC will “closely monitor” developments, and removing its pledge to be “patient” as it determined the appropriateness of rates. Analysts have immediately taken the latest tweaks as a sign that the FOMC has opened the door to future rate cuts, if required. There was no mention of any tweaks to the balance sheet plan. In the aftermath, risk assets rallied in a manner consistent with a loosening of financial conditions (stocks up, yields down, dollar down, while gold rallied).</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Dollar drifts into FOMC, mulling how dovish Fed will be",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback remains mixed vs major rivals and rather jittery overall as the <strong>DXY </strong>hovers around 97.500 and the clock ticks down to the FOMC, SEP and post-meeting conference from Chair Powell. The market anticipates or rather expects a dovish message and has priced in a 25 cut in July at the very least, while the external pressure is mounting to the extent that US President Trump is almost demanding looser policy, especially after ECB President effectively flagged more stimulus on the eve of the latest Fed decision. Technically, not much either side of the 97.683-393 range before the 97.802 mtd high and 96.873, which was last Thursday’s low, aside the psychological 97.000 level if Powell and co match or surpass expectations.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>Extending earlier outperformance as the Buck slips pretty much across the board, with Cable rebounding through 1.2600 and clearing a couple of near term technical levels (like Monday’s peak and the 100 HMA) on the way to a circa 1.2635 recovery high. Meanwhile, <strong>EUR</strong>/Gbp has pulled back further from around 0.8975 at one stage on Tuesday and under 0.8900, as the single currency pivots 1.1200 and struggles to clear mega expiries spanning the big figure even after the NY cut in wake of ECB President Draghi’s decidedly dovish musings yesterday. Note, Sterling climbed after broadly in line UK inflation data earlier and ahead of the BoE, but may get further independent impetus when results of the 3rd Tory leadership vote appear (from 18.00BST) Elsewhere, Eur/Chf is slipping deeper below 1.1200 alongside Usd/Chf towards 0.9950, but the SNB will be monitoring the situation and ready to respond if the Franc becomes more than highly valued.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Loonie is off best levels, but still relatively firm vs its US counterpart and Antipodean currency peers following firmer than forecast Canadian CPI data and a hefty headline y/y beat in particular. Usd/Cad currently hovering above 1.3350 within a 1.3337-83 range and back up near decent expiry interest between 1.3350-70 (1.2 bn) before they rolled off. Conversely, the Aussie and Kiwi are looking more nervous pre-FOMC and in advance of Q1 NZ GDP before a speech from RBA Governor Lowe in the early hours on Thursday. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd now circa 0.6870 and 0.6525 and both towards the base of 0.6856-85 and 0.6515-38 bands.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Yen has been largely restricted vs the Dollar in 108.25-61 parameters and also awaiting the Fed ahead of the BoJ, with expiries in the mix from 108.00 and then 108.30-40 in 2.95 bn and 1.3 bn respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Real is on a weaker footing vs the Greenback in line with broader trends across the region and looking towards the BCB for some non-Fed inspiration via forward guidance given that the Selic rate is seen on hold and 2 eases are anticipated before the end of 2019 at present. Meanwhile, the Rand has derived some traction from above consensus SA CPI ahead of tomorrow’s State of the Union address from President Ramaphosa. Last, but not least (as usual), the Lira also pared worst losses prompted by more threats of US sanctions against Turkey over the impending arrival of S-400 missiles from Russia as CBRT minutes reaffirmed disinflationary factors and a determination to deploy all tools to combat threats to CPI deviating from its gradual path towards target. Usd/Brl, Usd/Zar and Usd/Try near 3.8720, 14.5130 and 5.8400 respectively.</p>",

(+1.0%)</strong> were buoyed after US President Trump announced the resumption of US-China trade talks and that he will be conducting an extended meeting with Chinese President Xi at the G20 following “a very good” telephone conversation between the 2 leaders, while the PBoC were also supportive with the announcement of liquidity injections through reverse repos and its medium-term lending facility. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher after the dovish comments from ECB’s Draghi added to the declining global yields narrative which saw a drop in 10yr JGB yields to their lowest since August 2016, while the BoJ also kick starts its 2-day policy meeting where they are expected to maintain current policy settings and reaffirm guidance of keeping rates at very low interest rate levels for an extended period of time at least through around Spring 2020.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 240bln through 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility.

The Yen is also wary of BoJ guidance skewed towards ongoing or even more stimulus, and bound by hefty expiries as 2.95 bn rolls off at the 108.00 strike and 1.3 bn between 108.30-40 vs the 108.25-61 range so far.

However, the index is braced for the Fed within a confined 97.683-553 range, and seemingly reluctant to breach chart/psychological resistance or support around 97.639 (61.8% Fib retracement of pull-back from 98.373 ytd peak to recent 96.451 low) and 97.500 respectively in the run up – see the Ransquawk Research Suite for a full preview.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>Bucking the overall muted trend, Cable has continued its recovery towards 1.2600 after broadly in line with forecast UK CPI and PPI data and ahead of the BoE tomorrow, while Eur/Gbp has also retraced further to test 0.8900 compared to circa 0.8975 before ECB President Draghi’s apparent dovish Sintra revelations. Similarly, the Franc is consolidating back above parity and over 1.1200 vs the single currency as markets tread more cautiously in wake of yesterday’s risk-on session.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck, as noted above, with the Euro licking wounds inflicted by latest dovish ECB vibes and back on the 1.1200 handle where extremely heavy option expiry interest is anchored (5.2 bn 10 pips either side of the big figure). The Yen is also wary of BoJ guidance skewed towards ongoing or even more stimulus, and bound by hefty expiries as 2.95 bn rolls off at the 108.00 strike and 1.3 bn between 108.30-40 vs the 108.25-61 range so far. Elsewhere, the Loonie awaits Canadian CPI data and is holding above 1.3400 with decent expiries from 1.3350-70 (1.2 bn) in close proximity, while the Aussie and Kiwi are both maintaining their recovery momentum over 0.6850 and 0.6500 respectively ahead of RBA Governor Lowe and NZ Q1 GDP, with the former not unduly ruffled by the latest in a growing list of calls for more rate cuts. Back to Europe, the <strong>SEK </strong>is holding up relatively well in the face of further deterioration in Swedish business sentiment, NIER seeing slower GDP in the next few quarters and a jump in unemployment that was only partly seasonal, statistical and student related, as the Eur cross remains just below 10.7000.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira is back on the rack and underperforming amidst the general retracement noted above, and the renewed threat of US sanctions against Turkey has lifted Usd/Try off recent lows to 5.9150+ at one stage. Elsewhere, the Rand has unwound some of its Eskom-related outsize gains despite firmer the forecast SA CPI, with Usd/Zar rebounding through 14.5000.</p>",

Moreover, pre-FOMC positioning favours a cautious/defensive approach on the premise that so much easing is already factored in and the danger is disappointment if the Fed fails to deliver. Back to the ECB, Lautenschlager and Coeure set the stage for closing conference remarks from Draghi. Also ahead, Eurozone current account and construction output, plus relatively small 2046 German supply. Bunds meandering between 172.55-72 vs yesterday’s 172.86 close and 172.88 contract peak, 10 year yield circa -31 bp.</p>",

The complex took influence from the Bund in the European morning after a dovish set of comments from ECB chief Draghi (more stimulus could be on the way unless the data improves), which eventually led to Bund yields hitting fresh record lows, before paring back as risk sentiment improved as Trump signalled progress was being made with China on trade ahead of the G20 meeting. Treasuries, however, remained bid, and 10-year yields fell to a whisker of the psychological 2.00% mark. 3m/10yr inversion deepened by around 6bps on the day, while major curve spreads were narrower by around 1-2bps at settlement. US T-note futures (M9) settled 5+ higher at 127-04+.</p><p><strong>US President Trump was said to have asked White House lawyers on options for removing Fed Chair Powell in February</strong>, although they determined that a removal would be highly questionable.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets rallied across the board as the region followed suit to the heightened global risk appetite due to a double dosage of optimism from ECB President Draghi’s hints of potential easing and after US President Trump confirmed a meeting with his Chinese counterpart at the G20. ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) were higher with Australia led by energy names after a surge in oil prices and with outperformance also seen in the trade sensitive industries such as tech, materials and miners, while the Japanese benchmark gapped above the 21K level fuelled by favourable currency flows and strength in commodity-related sectors. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.5%) were buoyed after US President Trump announced the resumption of US-China trade talks and that he will be conducting an extended meeting with Chinese President Xi at the G20 following “a very good” telephone conversation between the 2 leaders, while the PBoC were also supportive with the announcement of liquidity injections through reverse repos and its medium-term lending facility. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher after the dovish comments from ECB’s Draghi added to the declining global yields narrative which saw a drop in 10yr JGB yields to their lowest since August 2016, while the BoJ also kick starts its 2-day policy meeting where they are expected to maintain current policy settings and reaffirm guidance of keeping rates at very low interest rate levels for an extended period of time at least through around Spring 2020.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets have rallied across the board as the region follows suit to the heightened global risk appetite due to a double dosage of optimism after ECB President Draghi hinted at potential easing and US President Trump confirmed a meeting with his Chinese counterpart at the G20. ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) are higher with Australia led by energy names after a surge in oil prices and with outperformance also seen in the trade sensitive industries such as tech, materials and miners, while the Japanese benchmark gapped above the 21K level fuelled by favourable currency flows and strength in commodity-related sectors. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) are also buoyed after US President Trump announced the resumption of US-China trade talks in which he will be conducting an extended meeting with Chinese President Xi at the G20 following “a very good” telephone conversation between the 2 leaders, while the PBoC was also obliging with the announcement of liquidity injections through reverse repos and its medium-term lending facility.</p><p>DXY is steady and remains near this month’s highs after the recent Draghi-induced selling in EUR/USD and amid US-China trade hopes. As such, EUR/USD languishes just below the 1.1200 handle after ECB President Draghi paved the way for looser policy in which he suggested that additional stimulus will be needed if the outlook does not improve and that APP still has considerable headroom, while source reports suggested that ECB policymakers were divided on measures with a rate cut, guidance change and more QE all in play. GBP/USD is little changed overnight although recently found reprieve from support near 1.2500 and JPY-crosses are kept afloat by the risk appetite. Antipodeans also hold on to the prior day’s gains due to their high-beta statuses and amid upside in commodities, but with further advances during Asia hours limited ahead of today’s FOMC and amid further dovish calls on the RBA with AMP forecasting unemployment to increase to 5.5% and the Cash Rate to be lowered 3 more times to 0.50% by February 2020.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher after the dovish comments from ECB’s Draghi added to the declining global yields narrative in which 10yr JGB yields slipped to their lowest since August 2016, while the BoJ also kicks starts its 2-day policy meeting where they are expected to maintain current policy settings and reaffirm guidance of keeping rates at very low interest rate levels for an extended period of time at least through around Spring 2020.</p>",
