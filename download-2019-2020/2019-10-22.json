(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>It was a mixed session, with Dow components MCD and TRV slipping after earnings; NDX component FB lower after expanded probes, but offsetting that downside, BIIB surged after winning drug approval and solid earnings. A decent 2-year auction was followed by the UK government losing a key Brexit vote, which eventually saw Treasuries higher (though desks note thin conditions in the TPLEX), and even weighed on US indices. Nasdaq component Biogen (BIIB) surged to intraday highs of +40% on Tuesday following the combination of a go ahead with its Aducanumab Biological License Application in early 2020, following talks with the FDA as its phase 3 study investigational treatment on early treatment for Alzheimer’s met its primary endpoint, a significant reduction in clinical decline; BIIB results also beat on top and bottom lines. The news weighed on Alzheimer competitor Merck (MRK) which fell as much as 5% on Tuesday. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) traded higher as its Phase 3 Checkmate 9LA met its primary endpoint. Under Armour (UAA) traded higher as it announced its new CEO as Patrik Fisk, the current COO of UAA and its Founder Kevin Plank is to become an executive chairman and brand chief. Juniper (JNPR) were higher following an upgrade at JPM. Electronic Arts (EA) slightly lower after a downgrade at Barclays. Lyft (LYFT) and Uber (UBER) rallied as Lyft announced the company will be profitable on an Adj. EBITDA basis year before analyst expectations. Netflix (NFLX) were lower as Verizon (VZ) announced it is to begin offering 12 months of Disney+ (DIS) to all new and existing 4G LTE &amp; 5G unlimited wireless customers as of 12th November, which was later reported to be 50mln customers.</p><p>At settlement, yields were lower, and the curve had bull-flattened slightly. The Treasury complex was quiet, with little by way of major moves. Indeed, some desks were noting that the volume in the T-Note future over the last three days was the lowest it has been since middle of November 2014, and even lower than some holiday periods. The Treasury auction of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through by 1bps on solid cover, which was above recent averages; Indirect participation, which can often be a gauge for foreign demand, was 54.8%, higher than the 6-auction average of 48.4%. Directs took 14%, less than the 6-auction average of 21.4%, leaving dealers with 31.2%, above than the average of 30.2%. Tomorrow, the Treasury will auction a 5-year note; the previous 5-year auction was soft, tailing by 0.9bps, and cover coming in below recent averages. But analysts at SocGen suggest that the 5-year sector has slight set-up ahead of Wednesday's auction from a relative value perspective, noting that the current 5-year trades cheap in asset swap compared to older 5s, and also trades cheap on the curve compared to 2s and 10s. SocGen believes that the auction will still need some concession, since the current WI yield is low when compared to previous stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness on an outright basis versus the previous auction cycles. SocGen also says that relatively low dealer holdings in the 3-6-year bucket should marginally support demand. The bank says it is neutral on the auction. US T-note (Z9) settled 6 ticks higher at 129-26.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>SNAPSHOT: Equities mixed, Treasuries higher, crude lower, USD higher.</li><li>REAR VIEW: UK govt loses key Brexit vote; US existing home sales miss; Canadian retail sales miss; BOC BOS upbeat; OPEC to mull deeper cuts, sources say.&nbsp;</li><li>COMING-UP: US House Price Index, EZ Consumer Confidence. Wednesday earnings from BA, MSFT, LLY, EBAY, PYPL, CAT, F, TSLA, GD, WDC; 5-year Treasury auction; bund auction; South African CPI.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>It was a mixed session, with Dow components MCD and TRV slipping after earnings; NDX component FB lower after expanded probes, but offsetting that downside, BIIB surged after winning drug approval and solid earnings. A decent 2-year auction was followed by the UK government losing a key Brexit vote, which eventually saw Treasuries higher (though desks note thin conditions in the TPLEX), and even weighed on US indices. The downside in the pound (and by extension, EUR) added support for the buck, which trades firmer heading into APAC trade.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The government won the support of lawmakers for its Withdrawal Bill Agreement at its second reading, but could not secure support for its legislative timetable, adding uncertainty to the Brexit process. The WAB passed by a margin of 329-299 (a healthy 30 margin, which raised hopes it could push through the timetable too); however, the programme motion was defeated 308-322 (a margin of 14). The upshot, UK PM Johnson said, was that the risks of a no deal Brexit had increased, and the government must accelerate no deal preparations; Johnson indicated that he would advise the EU that his administration will pause the legislation until the EU has decided on the length of an Article 50 extension (he intimated he would argue for only a short extension to avoid delay), and once again pledged that one way or another, the UK will be leaving the EU on his deal. From the EU perspective, multiple Brussels diplomats have reportedly said that the EU expected to follow Benn Act and give (a likely flexible) extension until 31st January 2020; if there was unanimous backing, this could be done in writing, rather than going through full EU Council meeting, Sky reported, citing sources.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES: </strong>September's home sales fell to a rate of 5.38mln, missing the consensus 5.45mln. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that these data can be noisy over short time frames, and sales are still trending higher. Pantheon points out that. The annualised rate for single-family homes has nudged above zero in the past two months, following 19 consecutive declines, and the consultancy says that the increase in mortgage applications to cycle highs in the last few months points to clear gains in sales through the year-end and into early 2020, underpinned by lower mortgage rates. \"By the end of the winter, though, we expect the upturn to run out of steam as payroll growth slows, layoffs rise and consumers' confidence fades,\" Pantheon says \"in the meantime, supply remains tight, with the 12-month average for single-family homes dipping back below four months for the first time since January,\" and as a result, \"price increases have firmed, with the Y/Y rate rising to 6.1% in September, the highest since July 2017; for most of this year, the trend has been about 4%.\"</p><p><strong>* US RICHMOND FED MANUFACTURING: </strong>The Richmond Fed's manufacturing gauge came in above expectations, rising to 8 from -9, the highest since April. \"At a high level, this may indicate some stability in the factory sector, as all subcomponents returned to positive territory, though we'll wait to see confirmation across other regions before drawing too big of a conclusion,\" BMO said.</p><p><strong>* BOC BUSINESS OUTLOOK SURVEY: </strong>The latest edition of the BOS pointed to slight improvements in business sentiment, but noted that regional differences within Canada were becoming more pronounces. The future sales gauge was positive in most regions, foreign demand was positive but was weighed down by trade tensions. The survey found Canadian businesses’ expectations of US growth weakened, with some expecting a mild recession in the next year, which could impact sales negatively. The survey also found that plans to invest and hire more in the next year were healthy outside of the energy producing regions. Capacity pressures, meanwhile, were somewhat elevated in some firms due to tightening labour constraints, but firms anticipate that capacity pressures will increase over the next year. Input price growth was expected to soften modestly on the back of less pressure from commodity-related inputs; output prices are seen growing at a slightly quicker rate than over the last year. Firms had reported a marginal easing in credit conditions over the last quarter. Inflation expectations were generally unchanged, and a majority of firms are still expected inflation will be in the lower half of the BOC’s target range. Finally, the loan officer survey found that mortgage lending conditions eased in Q3, non-mortgage lending conditions tightened; there were concerns about the economic outlook, as well as the energy sector in some regions which resulted in tightened price and non-price lending conditions.</p><p><strong>* CANADA RETAIL SALES: </strong>Canadian retail sales fell by -0.1% M/M in August, against expectations of a 0.4% rise; the core rate declined by 0.2% M/M missing expectations of 0.1% growth. The miss may have been driven by the fall in gasoline prices. But RBC says that the retail spending backdrop still looks lacklustre, relative to ostensibly sharply improving labour markets. \"Sale volumes were still only up 0.5% year-over-year in August compared to a 2.5% surge in employment year-over-year in the month (and almost 4% wage growth),\" still, \"overall consumer spending trends have been stronger than the retail numbers alone would imply, and households certainly appear to be spending more on real-estate, given that residential investment is on track to post a solid Q3 increase with home resales up seven months running through September.\" RBC adds that promises made in the federal election imply potentially some form of, albeit likely modest, fiscal tailwind to household purchasing power could yet be coming.</p><p><strong>* CANADA ELECTION: </strong>Justin Trudeau's Liberal's won the largest share of the vote, though lacks a majority, with indications that it will win 155 of the 338 seats. It means the Liberals will have to form a coalition, likely with the NDP, which is projected to take 25 seats. The CAD's reaction was muted, given this scenario was in line with market thinking.</p><p><strong>* PBOC: </strong>Ahead of the the tax repayment day, which may have tightened liquidity conditions, the PBOC boosted liquidity injecting the largest daily amount of cash into banking system since May via CNY 250bln of 7-day reverse repos, keeping the rate steady at 2.55%. It highlights a dilemma faced by the PBOC, UBS said, the central bank wants to continue lowering borrowing costs to the real economy, given downward pressures on growth. UBS notes that, ex-pork prices, CPI is showing deflationary signs, while PPI is already in deflation territory. The central bank is bound by its 3.0% CPI ceiling, and the September data has showed CPI already testing this zone. \"Even if pork prices does not go up much further in the following months, China might continue to see its CPI printed higher toward 2019 year end which will constrain how much more the PBOC can do, especially to cut RRRs or MLF rates any time soon,\" UBS writes, \"as such, the central bank might have to adopt other measures, such as liquidity injection (like what they have done in OMO today),\" and its analysts are expecting more liquidity injections via TMLF later this week.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 -0.4% at 2996, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.1% at 26791, NASDAQ-100 -0.8% at 7875. </strong>SECTORS: Energy&nbsp; 1.3%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.8%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.5%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.2%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0%, Financials&nbsp; -0.3%, Materials&nbsp; -0.4%, Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.7%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.9%, Information Technology&nbsp; -1.4%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Nasdaq component Biogen (BIIB) surged to intraday highs of +40% on Tuesday following the combination of a go ahead with its Aducanumab Biological License Application in early 2020, following talks with the FDA as its phase 3 study investigational treatment on early treatment for Alzheimer’s met its primary endpoint, a significant reduction in clinical decline; BIIB results also beat on top and bottom lines. The news weighed on Alzheimer competitor Merck (MRK) which fell as much as 5% on Tuesday. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) traded higher as its Phase 3 Checkmate 9LA met its primary endpoint. Under Armour (UAA) traded higher as it announced its new CEO as Patrik Fisk, the current COO of UAA and its Founder Kevin Plank is to become an executive chairman and brand chief. Juniper (JNPR) were higher following an upgrade at JPM. Electronic Arts (EA) slightly lower after a downgrade at Barclays. Lyft (LYFT) and Uber (UBER) rallied as Lyft announced the company will be profitable on an Adj. EBITDA basis year before analyst expectations. Netflix (NFLX) were lower as Verizon (VZ) announced it is to begin offering 12 months of Disney+ (DIS) to all new and existing 4G LTE &amp; 5G unlimited wireless customers as of 12th November, which was later reported to be 50mln customers.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>McDonald’s (MCD) missed on EPS, revenue and US comp sales. Hasbro (HAS) fell following a rather large EPS miss (1.84, Exp. 2.21) which was a result from the US China trade war tariffs; HAS announced it will be suspending its share repurchase programme. Travelers (TRV) and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), also lower on earnings. Those benefitting from earnings include Harley Davidson (HOG) who beat on EPS and revenues, although motorcycle sales did fall Y/Y. Sherwin Williams (SHW) traded higher on an EPS and revenue beat, and forecasts FY19 EPS slightly above average estimates. Procter and Gamble (PG) rose ~4% as it posted<strong> </strong>earnings beats and raised its guidance.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.97 HIGHER AT USD 54.48; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.74 HIGHER AT USD 59.70: </strong>Crude prices extended gains in late morning trade, after Reuters reported that OPEC and its allies were to consider deeper oil cuts at its December meeting, amid concerns over global demand growth in 2020, sources said. However, the report stated that Saudi Arabia wanted to focus on improving compliance to the supply cut pact before committing to further cuts (possibly alluding to Iraq and Nigeria, which have not fully complied with the agreement). The source said that the Saudis wanted to prevent oil prices from falling, but now they wanted to make sure that countries like Iraq and Nigeria hit 100% compliance first, as they have promised. Ahead of the report, crude markets were firmer, with traders citing positive commentary on the US/China trade talks front. Some desks also said book squaring in November WTI futures ahead of contract expiration might also be supporting prices. Aftermarket, attention will be on the API's inventory report; inventories are seen building for the sixth straight week, with analysts forecasting crude +1.7mln; the products are seen drawing, with the street expecting distillates -2.7mln and gasoline -2.3mln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-26. </strong>At settlement, yields were lower, and the curve had bull-flattened slightly. The Treasury complex was quiet, with little by way of major moves. Indeed, some desks were noting that the volume in the T-Note future over the last three days was the lowest it has been since middle of November 2014, and even lower than some holiday periods. The Treasury auction of 2-year notes was solid, stopping through by 1bps on solid cover, which was above recent averages; Indirect participation, which can often be a gauge for foreign demand, was 54.8%, higher than the 6-auction average of 48.4%. Directs took 14%, less than the 6-auction average of 21.4%, leaving dealers with 31.2%, above than the average of 30.2%. Tomorrow, the Treasury will auction a 5-year note; the previous 5-year auction was soft, tailing by 0.9bps, and cover coming in below recent averages. But analysts at SocGen suggest that the 5-year sector has slight set-up ahead of Wednesday's auction from a relative value perspective, noting that the current 5-year trades cheap in asset swap compared to older 5s, and also trades cheap on the curve compared to 2s and 10s. SocGen believes that the auction will still need some concession, since the current WI yield is low when compared to previous stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness on an outright basis versus the previous auction cycles. SocGen also says that relatively low dealer holdings in the 3-6-year bucket should marginally support demand. The bank says it is neutral on the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: GBP</strong> was trading horizontally around 1.2950 ahead of key Brexit votes, and saw two-way action in wake of the government’s win and then loss, rising to just shy of 1.30, before heading to session lows around 1.2880, and goes into APAC sub-1.29. The <strong>EUR</strong> was not immune from the Sterling swings, and that continued to support the <strong>DXY</strong>, which had generally traded on the front foot in Tuesday trade. <strong>CAD</strong> was flat/lower, following soft retail sales, although a generally upbeat BOS from the BOC did contribute some positive ticks; traders were digesting the impact of the new Canadian government, which could result in lower investment in the key energy sector, with the government coalition (Liberals/NDP) likely to pursue a more green approach. Most <strong>LatAM</strong> FX firmed as Chile’s government said it was willing to listen to protestors demands; <strong>BRL</strong> traders will be eying the Senate’s pension reform vote on Tuesday night; <strong>MXN</strong> was said to be dragged by uncertainty over US/China and USMCA passage through US Congress. Activity currencies (<strong>AUD, NZD</strong>) followed the risk tone lower.</p>",

However, the report stated that Saudi Arabia wanted to focus on improving compliance to the supply cut pact before committing to further cuts (possibly alluding to Iraq and Nigeria, which have not fully complied with the agreement). The source said that the Saudis wanted to prevent oil prices from falling, but now they wanted to make sure that countries like Iraq and Nigeria hit 100% compliance first, as they have promised. Ahead of the report, crude markets were firmer, with traders citing positive commentary on the US/China trade talks front. Some desks also said book squaring in November WTI futures ahead of contract expiration might also be supporting prices. Aftermarket, attention will be on the API's inventory report; inventories are seen building for the sixth straight week, with analysts forecasting crude +1.7mln; the products are seen drawing, with the street expecting distillates -2.7mln and gasoline -2.3mln.</p>",

The WAB passed by a margin of 329-299 (a healthy 30 margin, which raised hopes it could push through the timetable too); however, the programme motion was lost 308-322 (a margin of 14). The upshot, UK PM Johnson said, was that the risks of a no deal Brexit have increased, and the government must accelerate no deal preparations; Johnson indicated that he would advise the EU that his administration will pause the legislation until the EU has decided on the length of an Article 50 extension (he intimated he would argue for only a short extension to avoid delay),<strong> </strong>and once again pledged that one way or another, the UK will be leaving the EU on his deal.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S ISSUANCE: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (USD 40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed), and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu); Analysts at UBS note that there are around USD 84bln of cash flows at the end-month settlement (excluding SOMA holdings), including around USD 75bln of redemptions and around USD 9bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>2-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The latest Treasury selling builds a solid concession for all three of this week's auction, analysts at BMO argue, noting that while yields are still some way off the top of recent ranges, the back-up in bullish extremes will likely prevent any significant supply hiccups; but BMO warns that next week's FOMC (on 31st October) could result in some bidder hesitation. \"Any Fed-related step-back will not be a function of scepticism of another 25bps cut, but rather that Powell may begin to lay the groundwork for a shift back to pause,\" the bank argues. \"To be fair, the odds of a December cut are currently around 25% (assuming a 25bps cut in October) so any down-trade following a hawkish policy adjustment would likely be limited.\" BMO argues that it still thinks that the front-end holds plenty of appeal versus OIS, as well as longer-dated Treasuries, and accordingly, the auction's performance may be a function of intraday price action going into the supply. BMO looks for decent performance at this week's auction, and says this is particularly in the context of the Fed’s reserve management purchases in the bill market, and BMO believes that structural demand from the central bank will offer a tailwind to bills versus OIS, and also a degree of outperformance in short coupons as well. \"The three rounds of bill buying on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday will each be to the tune of USD 7.5bln in maturities one-year and in, and we soon expect these operations as well as the MBS reinvestments will fade into the background, if for no other reason than the first pass which took place last week saw USD 33bln offered from primary dealers to meet the Fed's USD 7.5bln in demand, which is a testament to the depth and liquidity of the very front-end of the Treasury market.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECENT 2-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>High Yield: Prev. 1.612%, six-auction average 1.855%.&nbsp;</li><li>Tail: Prev. -0.9bps (stops through), six-auction average -0.5bps.&nbsp;</li><li>Bid-to-Cover: Prev. 2.64x, six-auction average 2.61x.&nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: Prev. 27.1%, six-auction average 30.2%.&nbsp;</li><li>Directs: Prev. 15.9%, six-auction average 21.4%.&nbsp;</li><li>Indirects: Prev. 57.0%, six-auction average 48.4%</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/CHF/CAD</strong></p><p>Sterling recoiled further from yesterday’s 1.3000+ multi-month highs when UK PM Johnson confirmed that rejection of the Government’s Programme Motion would likely result in the WAB being withdrawn and a GE motion as soon as another Brexit extension is agreed with the EU. However, with that result and outcome of the initial 19.00BST vote still uncertain, albeit latter looking positive in terms of indications, Cable has pared losses from sub-1.2900 and 0.8930 or so vs the Euro amidst reports that up to 30 opposition party Labour MPs may back the draft treaty. Meanwhile, the Franc continues to flounder or retrace from recent safe-haven peaks vs the Buck and Euro, eyeing 0.9900 and straddling 1.1000 respectively, but the Loonie has regrouped and recovered from circa post-Canadian retail sales lows (headline and ex-auto prints both much weaker than expected) in wake of a relatively upbeat BoC loans and business outlook survey. Indeed, Usd/Cad is back below 1.3100 within a 1.3122-1.3070 range in wake of Canada’s election results that saw Liberal leader Trudeau retain the Premiership, albeit with a reduced majority, but with the added impetus of a spike in crude prices on bullish OPEC+ comments.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Yen has arguably been even more restrained by the lack of Japanese participants due to the Core Enthronement Ceremony holiday, with Usd/Jpy only marginally extending overnight parameters to the downside through 108.50, but holding above support at 108.41. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is clinging to 0.6400 after topping out around 0.6435 vs its US counterpart and trying to keep tabs on 1.0700 against the Aussie in the run up to NZ trade data, while Aud/Usd did not quite trip a 0.6850 option expiry (850 mn) awaiting RBA rhetoric via Deputy Governor Kent. The single currency has largely been caught between Pound and Greenback moved in the absence of anything that significant or Eurozone specific bar EC concerns over Italian and French 2020 budgets, but Eur/Usd has drifted down to fresh sub-1.1125 lows and a tad more convincingly through the 100 DMA (1.1136).</p><p><strong>DXY/EM</strong></p><p>The Dollar has fared better in relation to G10 peers than EM currencies, with the&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>hugging a firmer line close to 97.500 ahead of disappointing US existing home sales in contrast to an upbeat Richmond Fed survey. However, the Lira, Rand and Real have all outperformed amidst reports that Turkey’s Finance Minister is eyeing more CBRT funds, the aforementioned rally in oil and more technical gains/corrective trade.</p>",

        "subject": "BREXIT TIMETABLE: Can Johnson get the WAB through parliament in three days?",
        "content": "<p><strong>* THE LATEST:</strong> Yesterday evening, the government introduced its Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) that would put UK PM Johnson’s Brexit agreement with the EU into UK law. Expectations are for the government’s Brexit deal to have enough support from MPs to pass its initial vote. However, the bill faces a number of amendments, including one for a Customs Union with the EU, for which there is some uncertainty whether or not this vote will have enough votes to pass; last time the HoC voted on a Customs Union with the EU (in its series of ‘indicative votes’), it was defeated 273 to 276 with 89 abstentions. Tory MPs who voted for the Customs Union last time will likely oppose the amendment in favour of the governments deal in its current form, while the DUP are also likely to oppose it. However, the Liberal Democrats and SNP, most of whom abstained last time on account of their opposition to Brexit in all forms, might be inclined to vote for the amendment as a means of scuppering the government’s plan. The government has warned that it is likely to pull the WAB in entirety should any amendments on it pass and go for an election instead. In this instance, an extension from the EU until at least 31 January is likely.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* PROGRAMME MOTION: </strong>Should the WAB pass at 19:00 BST (which many desks see as likely given recent indications of voting intentions by individual MPs), there will immediately be a vote on the government’s proposed timetable for passing the WAB into UK law. The government, in its Programme Motion, is proposing getting the WAB passed in three days, which by historical standards is a very short period of time for Parliament to approve a bill; opposition MPs have been enraged by the timetable, accusing the government of trying to “ram through” the bill without proper scrutiny. Overnight reports warned that the government may be facing a tight vote on the programme motion, with the government possibly needing up to 20 Labour MP votes to make up for Tory rebels. Should MPs vote down the government’s timetable, the government may miss its target of leaving the EU by the end of the month, warned UK Leader of the Commons Reese-Mogg. Most recently, the government confirmed that if it loses its programme motion vote, it will press for an election, apparently as soon as the EU agrees an extension.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*TIMETABLE:</strong></p><p><strong>Today</strong>;</p><p>12:30 BST – Debate begins on the second reading of the WAB</p><p>19:00 BST – Vote on the second reading of the WAB</p><p>19:15 BST – Vote on the Programme Motion</p><p>19:30 BST – Bills Passage (IF Programme Motion passes) and three hours of debate on amendments at the Committee Stage, followed by the first Committee Stage votes</p><p>On <strong>Wednesday</strong>; starting at 13:00 BST, there will be 12 hours of Committee stage debate on amendments, with votes every three hours. Committee Stage to conclude after midnight.&nbsp;</p><p>On <strong>Thursday</strong>; starting at 11:00 BST, the Report Stage begins, amendments can still be proposed until 17:00 BST. A final Third Reading Vote on the WAB expected after 19:00 BST.</p>",

The government wants a three day timetable, so that the UK can leave the EU by the 31 October. However, a number of MPs have been angered by the speed at which the government is trying to put this bill into law, some arguing it does not allow proper scrutiny of the bill.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European bourses are choppy (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%)</strong> albeit, the region drifted back into positive territory following initially losses seen at the open. Constructive reports on the EU/China trade during the early EU session ultimately did little to shift the sentiment at the time. In terms of sectors, the picture is mixed; with Consumer Staples (-0.5%) and Health Care (-0.2%) propping up and Tech (+0.4%) and Energy (+1.0%) topping the performance table. In terms of individual mover; Just Eat (+24.7%) shares spiked higher on the news that Prosus NV had made a cash offer for the Co, valuing it at GBP 4.9bln, or GBP 7.10 per share, Just Eat has since rejected the offer stating that it significantly undervalues the Co. in combination with Takeaway.com. Novartis (+0.1%) opened higher after the Co. raised net sales guidance but gave away gains in-line with the market-wide decline. UBS (+1.6%), SAAB (+5.4%), Software AG (+9.3%) and Sunrise Communications (+2.5%) were also beneficiaries of strong earnings reports. Conversely, weak earnings from AMS (+0.2%), Thales (-2.2%) and Reckitt Benckiser (-3.3%) saw their respective share prices under pressure. In terms of broker moves, a downgrade for TUI (-5.7%) at Morgan Stanley saw the Co.’s shares sell off.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Greenback is on a firmer footing, almost across the G10 board, with the DXY edging higher after testing support ahead of 97.000 yesterday and the index regains momentum to probe above 97.400 within a 97.440-259 range. However, the recovery looks largely due to declines in rival currencies rather than self-generated, as the Franc retreats further from recent peaks and Pound succumbs to a bout of more pronounced pre-UK Parliament vote jitters.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - The Kiwi is off best levels, but still outperforming and maintaining a bullish bias while holding above 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and having breached 1.0700 against the Aussie. Conversely, Aud/Usd continues to fade ahead of 0.6900 even though news on US-China trade has been mainly constructive of late amidst signs of the pair reaching overbought levels and a decent option expiry at 0.6850 (850 mn) may also be weighing. Back to the Nzd, trade data looms and may provide some fundamental impetus, while the Aud could be prone to comments from RBA Deputy Governor Kent also due later.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP</strong> - The major laggards as noted above, with Usd/Chf nudging towards 0.9900 and Cable retreating further from Monday’s 1.3000+ peaks in the run up to the WAB 2nd reading in the HoC that could set-off a chain of further votes and an extremely compressed timetable to get Brexit legislation in place for October 31. The Pound is holding above 1.2900 and managing to contain its pullback vs the Euro to circa 20 pips below 0.8600, as the single currency also fades against the Dollar.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/EUR</strong> - All narrowly mixed compared to the Buck, as the Yen meanders between 108.50-75, Loonie sustains gains within 1.3100-1.3070 parameters after the Canadian election and bulk of votes indicating that PM Trudeau is heading for a return to office with his Liberal Party, but also conscious that retail sales and the Q3 BoC business/loan survey are on tap and could impact. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd remains capped ahead of 1.1200 and has tested the 100 DMA (1.1136), but not convincingly.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Although the Dollar has pared some losses vs G10 peers and the Yuan has eased from recent highs, several regional currencies are staging comebacks of their own, like the Rand and even the Lira despite the impending end of the ceasefire and ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his Russian counterpart.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Eurozone bonds continue to front-run the broad recovery from Monday’s settlement levels and even deeper session lows in some cases, but a solid 2025 UK <strong>Gilt</strong> sale has underpinned the rebound on Liffe to 131.72 for the 10 year benchmark at best (+33 ticks vs -5 ticks at one stage). <strong>Bunds</strong> have pulled up just shy of yesterday’s 171.46 high, at 171.45 (+56 ticks vs -13 ticks at worst), while perhaps more interestingly French OATs and Italian BTPs have hardly flinched even though the EU has qualms over respective 2020 budget drafts, with the latter perhaps encouraged by strong demand for the latest retail offering. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are reluctantly tagging along ahead of US data and 2 year supply with the curve fractionally flatter in advance.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are choppy but ultimately in the green. Upside in prices coincided with reports that Indonesia’s Pertamina has temporarily halted fuel distribution via the pipeline in parts of West Java due to an explosion. Local media noted that the fire broke out on parts of the pipeline due to drilling activity in close proximity, although this was not confirmed by Pertamina’s spokesperson. <strong>WTI</strong> prices gained traction above the 53.50/bbl and currently eyes its 200 WMA at 53.81/bbl, while its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart rose comfortably above the 59.00/bbl mark. In terms of demand side commentary, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2020 oil growth demand outlook to 1.3mln bpd from 1.4mln bpd and sees US oil growth expectations to be reduced, while it suggested there is room for OPEC output to increase beyond 2020. For reference, the firm’s demand forecasts are modestly higher than that of the EIA, IEA and OPEC. Looking ahead, trader will be eyeing the weekly API crude data, but before that over in the UK, the vote on the 2nd reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may prompt some sentiment-driven action. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices remain firmer sub-1500/oz despite a bounce back in Dollar as participants could be hedging ahead of upcoming risk events, and with US-China also still on the radar. Meanwhile, <strong>Copper</strong> prices are on the backfoot today, mostly due to the indecisive risk sentiment coupled with a firmer Buck with prices back below 2.65/lb ahead of its 100 DMA at 2.63/lb. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures rose in excess of 1.2% at one point as the base metal was bouyed by continued supply woes after Vale halted a tailing dam earlier this month followed by downgrades in FY iron ore and pellet sales guidance.</p><p>Russian Energy Minister Novak said US oil production is unlikely to grow at the same pace seen in previous years at current oil prices.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European bourses are choppy (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%)</strong> albeit, the region drifted back into positive territory following initially losses seen at the open. Constructive reports on the EU/China trade during the early EU session ultimately did little to shift the sentiment at the time. In terms of sectors, the picture is mixed; with Consumer Staples (-0.5%) and Health Care (-0.2%) propping up and Tech (+0.4%) and Energy (+1.0%) topping the performance table. In terms of individual mover; Just Eat (+24.7%) shares spiked higher on the news that Prosus NV had made a cash offer for the Co, valuing it at GBP 4.9bln, or GBP 7.10 per share, Just Eat has since rejected the offer stating that it significantly undervalues the Co. in combination with Takeaway.com. Novartis (+0.1%) opened higher after the Co. raised net sales guidance but gave away gains in-line with the market-wide decline. UBS (+1.6%), SAAB (+5.4%), Software AG (+9.3%) and Sunrise Communications (+2.5%) were also beneficiaries of strong earnings reports. Conversely, weak earnings from AMS (+0.2%), Thales (-2.2%) and Reckitt Benckiser (-3.3%) saw their respective share prices under pressure. In terms of broker moves, a downgrade for TUI (-5.7%) at Morgan Stanley saw the Co.’s shares sell off.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Greenback is on a firmer footing, almost across the G10 board, with the DXY edging higher after testing support ahead of 97.000 yesterday and the index regains momentum to probe above 97.400 within a 97.440-259 range. However, the recovery looks largely due to declines in rival currencies rather than self-generated, as the Franc retreats further from recent peaks and Pound succumbs to a bout of more pronounced pre-UK Parliament vote jitters.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - The Kiwi is off best levels, but still outperforming and maintaining a bullish bias while holding above 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and having breached 1.0700 against the Aussie. Conversely, Aud/Usd continues to fade ahead of 0.6900 even though news on US-China trade has been mainly constructive of late amidst signs of the pair reaching overbought levels and a decent option expiry at 0.6850 (850 mn) may also be weighing. Back to the Nzd, trade data looms and may provide some fundamental impetus, while the Aud could be prone to comments from RBA Deputy Governor Kent also due later.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP</strong> - The major laggards as noted above, with Usd/Chf nudging towards 0.9900 and Cable retreating further from Monday’s 1.3000+ peaks in the run up to the WAB 2nd reading in the HoC that could set-off a chain of further votes and an extremely compressed timetable to get Brexit legislation in place for October 31. The Pound is holding above 1.2900 and managing to contain its pullback vs the Euro to circa 20 pips below 0.8600, as the single currency also fades against the Dollar.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/EUR</strong> - All narrowly mixed compared to the Buck, as the Yen meanders between 108.50-75, Loonie sustains gains within 1.3100-1.3070 parameters after the Canadian election and bulk of votes indicating that PM Trudeau is heading for a return to office with his Liberal Party, but also conscious that retail sales and the Q3 BoC business/loan survey are on tap and could impact. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd remains capped ahead of 1.1200 and has tested the 100 DMA (1.1136), but not convincingly.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Although the Dollar has pared some losses vs G10 peers and the Yuan has eased from recent highs, several regional currencies are staging comebacks of their own, like the Rand and even the Lira despite the impending end of the ceasefire and ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his Russian counterpart.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Eurozone bonds continue to front-run the broad recovery from Monday’s settlement levels and even deeper session lows in some cases, but a solid 2025 UK <strong>Gilt</strong> sale has underpinned the rebound on Liffe to 131.72 for the 10 year benchmark at best (+33 ticks vs -5 ticks at one stage). <strong>Bunds</strong> have pulled up just shy of yesterday’s 171.46 high, at 171.45 (+56 ticks vs -13 ticks at worst), while perhaps more interestingly French OATs and Italian BTPs have hardly flinched even though the EU has qualms over respective 2020 budget drafts, with the latter perhaps encouraged by strong demand for the latest retail offering. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are reluctantly tagging along ahead of US data and 2 year supply with the curve fractionally flatter in advance.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are choppy but ultimately in the green. Upside in prices coincided with reports that Indonesia’s Pertamina has temporarily halted fuel distribution via the pipeline in parts of West Java due to an explosion. Local media noted that the fire broke out on parts of the pipeline due to drilling activity in close proximity, although this was not confirmed by Pertamina’s spokesperson. <strong>WTI</strong> prices gained traction above the 53.50/bbl and currently eyes its 200 WMA at 53.81/bbl, while its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart rose comfortably above the 59.00/bbl mark. In terms of demand side commentary, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2020 oil growth demand outlook to 1.3mln bpd from 1.4mln bpd and sees US oil growth expectations to be reduced, while it suggested there is room for OPEC output to increase beyond 2020. For reference, the firm’s demand forecasts are modestly higher than that of the EIA, IEA and OPEC. Looking ahead, trader will be eyeing the weekly API crude data, but before that over in the UK, the vote on the 2nd reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may prompt some sentiment-driven action. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices remain firmer sub-1500/oz despite a bounce back in Dollar as participants could be hedging ahead of upcoming risk events, and with US-China also still on the radar. Meanwhile, <strong>Copper</strong> prices are on the backfoot today, mostly due to the indecisive risk sentiment coupled with a firmer Buck with prices back below 2.65/lb ahead of its 100 DMA at 2.63/lb. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures rose in excess of 1.2% at one point as the base metal was bouyed by continued supply woes after Vale halted a tailing dam earlier this month followed by downgrades in FY iron ore and pellet sales guidance.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback is on a firmer footing, almost across the G10 board, with the <strong>DXY </strong>edging higher after testing support ahead of 97.000 yesterday and the index regains momentum to probe above 97.400 within a 97.440-259 range. However, the recovery looks largely due to declines in rival currencies rather than self-generated, as the Franc retreats further from recent peaks and Pound succumbs to a bout of more pronounced pre-UK Parliament vote jitters.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is off best levels, but still outperforming and maintaining a bullish bias while holding above 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and having breached 1.0700 against the Aussie. Conversely, Aud/Usd continues to fade ahead of 0.6900 even though news on US-China trade has been mainly constructive of late amidst signs of the pair reaching overbought levels and a decent option expiry at 0.6850 (850 mn) may also be weighing. Back to the Nzd, trade data looms and may provide some fundamental impetus, while the Aud could be prone to comments from RBA Deputy Governor Kent also due later.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>The major laggards as noted above, with Usd/Chf nudging towards 0.9900 and Cable retreating further from Monday’s 1.3000+ peaks in the run up to the WAB 2nd reading in the HoC that could set-off a chain of further votes and an extremely compressed timetable to get Brexit legislation in place for October 31. The Pound is holding above 1.2900 and managing to contain its pullback vs the Euro to circa 20 pips below 0.8600, as the single currency also fades against the Dollar.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed compared to the Buck, as the Yen meanders between 108.50-75, Loonie sustains gains within 1.3100-1.3070 parameters after the Canadian election and bulk of votes indicating that PM Trudeau is heading for a return to office with his Liberal Party, but also conscious that retail sales and the Q3 BoC business/loan survey are on tap and could impact. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd remains capped ahead of 1.1200 and has tested the 100 DMA (1.1136), but not convincingly.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although the Dollar has pared some losses vs G10 peers and the Yuan has eased from recent highs, several regional currencies are staging comebacks of their own, like the Rand and even the Lira despite the impending end of the ceasefire and ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his Russian counterpart.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive amid mild tailwinds from Wall St where all major indices edged higher and the S&amp;P 500 closed back above the 3000 milestone with sentiment underpinned as officials continued to suggest optimism regarding a trade deal, although gains are capped amid a light calendar, Japanese holiday closure and ahead of a busy week of earnings stateside. ASX 200 (+0.3%) is positive with the index propped up by strength in the commodity-related sectors aside from gold miners after the precious metal trickled further below the USD 1500/oz level, while corporate updates have also provided a catalyst with Independence Group and Mirvac benefitting from higher quarterly earnings and sales respectively. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) conform to the marginal gains despite a firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which conducted CNY 250bln of 7-day reverse repos for its largest daily net injection in nearly 5 months, with the mainland choppy ahead of upcoming earnings and with Hong Kong anticipating the announcement of further supportive measures today.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre but off the prior day’s lows amid a non-committal tone across its major counterparts with EUR/USD relatively unchanged around the 1.1150 level, while GBP/USD notched mild gains and resumes a gradual approach towards the 1.3000 handle ahead of today’s Brexit-deal vote which is expected at 1900BST and although there has been increasing suggestion PM Johnson may have the numbers to get the withdrawal agreement through Parliament, his efforts could be scuppered again by a ‘Rainbow’ alliance of MPs seeking to enforce a customs union on the future relationship. USD/JPY saw mild upside amid the mostly positive risk tone but with gains limited by the lack of Japanese participants, and antipodeans remained afloat with outperformance in NZD/USD after it reclaimed the 0.6400 handle, although early strength in AUD/USD later faded as it was contained again by resistance at the prior day’s highs near 0.6880 and as a fallout of cross-related flows in which AUD/NZD slipped below 1.0700.</p>",
