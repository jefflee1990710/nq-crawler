In related comments, US Commerce Secretary Ross was upbeat on the state of negotiations and said that there is a good chance of a good settlement with China on immediate trade though structural issue and compliance are harder and similarly US Secretary of State Pompeo stated negotiations are making progress. Earlier reports suggested US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are reportedly mulling a potential summit in H1 2019 according to sources, if progress is made in this round of trade talks. Elsewhere, US Traders reported that China buys at least 3 cargoes (approx. 180,000 tonnes) of US soybeans for shipment through March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN:</strong> US President Trump announced he would speak publicly on immigration on Tuesday at 21:00 ET, some suggest this could be negative if he were to announce building the wall under national security rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> With Parliament back from the Christmas break, focus now falls on the Brexit meaningful vote scheduled for next week which is still expected to go ahead despite growing doubts that the proposed Brexit deal will receive the necessary support in Parliament. On Monday, PM May said to be seeking further assurances from the EU over the backstop to win the support of eurosceptic MPs although the EU Commission once again stressed that the deal on the table is the only one possible and it will not be renegotiated. She also said she will set out measures on Northern Ireland and will aim to give greater role on Brexit to Parliament. Alongside this, UK Brexit Secretary Barclay stated that it is the government&rsquo;s intention to not extend Article 50 and warned once again of the consequences of a no-deal. Reports have also suggested that Parliament will vote on two amendments to the finance bill on Tuesday, to ensure that a no-deal Brexit could only be delivered with the consensus of Parliament, which would result in a government shutdown unless UK PM May is able to secure support for her Brexit deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Bostic (non-voter, dovish) said that the US economy is &quot;pretty solid&quot; and that inflation is just a &quot;sliver&quot; below the 2% target, but prices could rise due to trade tariffs. He considers the neutral rate between 2.50%-2.75% and sees one rate increase for 2019. On the balance sheet he said the behaviour of longer term rates indicate the markets have not reacted strongly to the Fed reducing it and believes it should be reduced to a steady state. He attributed volatility in markets to uncertainty over trade policy and global economic &quot;clouds&quot; while he believes the government shutdown will have little impact as long as it &quot;stays short&quot;, though lack of data will make it harder for the Fed to do its job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM NON-MFG: </strong>The non-manufacturing ISM fell by more than expected in December, to 57.6 from 60.7 (Street was expecting 59.5). &quot;The index usually tracks the rate of growth of core retail sales but has been relatively elevated since Hurricane Florence in September&mdash;it also overshot after Hurricane Harvey in September 2017&mdash;so a correction was due, but the timing and extent was uncertain,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics said, adding that &quot;the December drop leaves the index about a point lower than we&rsquo;d normally expect, given the rate of growth of core retail sales in November - the sales numbers lead by a month or so - but that&rsquo;s well within the usual margin of error.&quot; Looking ahead, Pantheon suggests that the data is unlikely to be the start of a run of lower readings, noting that the Redbook&#39;s chainstore sales growth in late December was up to a record high, which is supportive for the non-manufacturing ISM. &quot;In short, this report is nothing to worry about; the fundamentals for the non-manufacturing sector are much better than in the industrial sector, where we think the ISM survey has further to fall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s de Guindos reiterated the council view that the ECB will continue to provide substantial accommodation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.56 HIGHER AT USD 48.52/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.27 HIGHER AT USD 57.33/BBL.</strong> The risk mood has been constructive at the start of the week, with equities trading higher and crude extending its run of modest gains, which has seen WTI positive for five straight sessions. &quot;The gains are adding to the case that declining OPEC production now represents a fundamental support for the market and that the December test of the USD 50 level back on December 26 may represent at least an interim trading bottom,&quot; Citi wrote, &quot;a steadier tone in global equity markets and a weaker US dollar are also providing a more supportive financial backdrop for commodities in general and the oil market in particular.&quot; Adding to positive ticks, was Genscape&#39;s forecast for Cushing stocks seen drawing by 267k barrels in the latest week. Additionally, OPEC officials cited by WSJ said the Saudis are seeking a return to USD 80/bbl oil prices to cover a boost in government spending, with the nation planning to cut crude exports to 7.1mln BPD at the end of January. The WSJ note that this would be a cut of around 800k BPD from levels seen in November, which would go beyond the commitments it made to OPEC; however, the article also suggested that officials were sceptical whether that sized cut would still be enough to lift oil to the USD 80/bbl region. It was also reported that crude exports in January are set to be around 1mln BPD down on November levels. Expectations for this week&rsquo;s energy inventory are for headline crude to draw by 3.3mln, distillates to build by 2.7mln, gasoline to build by 3.5mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +0.71% at 2550, NDX +1.02% at 6488, DJI +0.42% at 23531. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +1.31%, Materials +0.34%, Industrials +0.67%, Cons Discretionary +2.36%, Cons Staples -0.28%, Healthcare +0.42%, Financials +0.26%, Tech +0.87%, Telecoms +0.77%, Utilities -0.71%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Amazon (AMZN) helped indices move higher on the open as it benefitted from a Buy initiation at Pivotal Research; Netflix (NFLX) was another outperforming heavyweight. Micron (MU) opened higher after an upgrade at BMO Capital, pushing optimism to other semiconductor stocks including Western Digital (WDC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). Cancer-focused pharma co. Loxo Oncology (LOXO) surged following the announcement of Eli Lilly (LLY) acquiring it for USD 8bln. Dollar Tree (DLTR) outperformed after activist investor Starboard Value sought to push the co. for strategic alternatives including a sale of its Family Dollar unit. Tesla (TSLA) traded higher as progress gets made for its Chinese Gigafactory. Cowen Research downgraded tobacco stocks with Imperial Brands (IMB), British American Tobacco (BAT), Phillip Morris (PM) and Altria Group (MO) all trading lower. PG&amp;E (PCG) nosedived on announcements it was considering filling for bankruptcy in the wake of liabilities it faces for the California wildfires. Several Wall Street names have announced plans to create a new low-cost stock exchange, which saw Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) underperform. Later trade saw Medtronic (MDT) dip lower after announced 2020 would be a below target year for EPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H19) SETTLE 8 TICKS LOWER AT 122-01+.</strong> Following a range-bound overnight session, treasuries saw some upside in tandem with bunds as European traders sat at their desks and as equities sold off in early trade. Nonetheless, as risk sentiment improved and as stock indices turned green, opening higher in the US, the complex reversed course and drifted lower, also shrugging off disappointing Non-Mfg PMIs. The yield curve saw some modest bear-flattening as short dated yields were higher by c.5bps while longer date yields were higher by less than 1bps. 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps, 5s30s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 3-YEAR SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 38bln of 3-year notes on Tuesday, USD 24bln of 10-year notes on Wednesday, and USD 16bln of 30-year bonds on Thursday, all to settle 15 January; there are no reinvestments in the upcoming auctions. Analysts at Barclays observe that as auction sizes have steadily increased throughout the course of 2018, demand has trended lower, and cover at the December auction was 2.59x, near the low-end of the year compared with 3.13 at the beginning of 2018. &quot;Auctions experienced persistent weakness in the second half of the year, tailing an average of 0.3bps, compared with stopping through 0.1bps in the first half of the year,&quot; the bank writes. December&#39;s auction saw the return of the direct bid (13% takedown) after collapsing to 3% in November, and Barclays says this pickup was due to an increased takedown from domestic investors (up to 45% in December from 35% in November).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The USD continued its downward trend, triggered by Fed chair Powell on Friday after he adopted a slightly less rigid stance than he did during the December press conference. As such, the DXY conceded the 96.00 handle during Asia-Pac trade with a session low of 95.68 and levels not seen since early November 2018. Data did little to bolster sentiment for the greenback with today&rsquo;s ISM non-MFG PMI falling short of consensus (59.9 vs. Exp. 64.0). That said, it did little to place any further weight on the USD with traders mindful of upcoming key risk events (US-China trade talks, FOMC mins, CPI) and potentially already braced for a disappointing ISM report given the manufacturing print last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>continues to capitalise on USD weakness as the EUR/USD pair extended its advance above 1.14 to a session high of 1.1484 and shy of the YTD high of 1.1497. Gains for EUR vs. the USD are more a case of USD weakness than EUR strength with macro newsflow from the EZ relatively light. Nonetheless, if the multi-bloc currency manages to edge towards 1.1500 and the USD remains out of favour, Lloyds highlight a potential target of 1.1600 before an eventual move towards range highs of 1.1750-1.1850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GBP: </strong>Despite a slightly more tentative start to the session, cable eventually gained some traction as the session progressed with the pair breaching 1.2750 to the upside to make a session high print of 1.2786 and thus YTD highs. This comes in spite of a pick-up in Brexit-related commentary as UK lawmakers returned to Westminster with uncertainty on the process of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU rife as UK PM May&rsquo;s spokesperson stated that responsibility for confirming the meaningful vote remains with Parliament. As such, the next few days might test markets resolve in how willing they are to continue to buy up the GBP vs. USD, particularly if USD bulls return to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>remained in a relatively tight range vs. the USD of 0.7110 to 0.7150 with the pair unable to test tech resistance of 0.7174 and 0.7182 which marks the 55 and 100DMAs respectively. Sentiment for the pair will likely be guided by noises out of Beijing as trade talks between the US and China commence, with the potential aim of securing H1 talks between US President Trump and Chinese Premier Li.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The USD continued its downward trend, triggered by Fed chair Powell on Friday after he adopted a slightly less rigid stance than he did during the December press conference. As such, the DXY conceded the 96.00 handle during Asia-Pac trade with a session low of 95.68 and levels not seen since early November 2018. Data did little to bolster sentiment for the greenback with today&rsquo;s ISM non-MFG PMI falling short of consensus (59.9 vs. Exp. 64.0). That said, it did little to place any further weight on the USD with traders mindful of upcoming key risk events (US-China trade talks, FOMC mins, CPI) and potentially already braced for a disappointing ISM report given the manufacturing print last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, EUR continues to capitalise on USD weakness as the EUR/USD pair extended its advance above 1.14 to a session high of 1.1473 and shy of the YTD high of 1.1497. Gains for EUR vs. the USD are more a case of USD weakness than EUR strength with macro newsflow from the EZ relatively light. Nonetheless, if the multi-bloc currency manages to edge towards 1.1500 and the USD remains out of favour, Lloyds highlight a potential target of 1.1600 before an eventual move towards range highs of 1.1750-1.1850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a slightly more tentative start to the session for GBP, cable eventually gained some traction as the session progressed with the pair breaching 1.2750 to the upside to make a session high print of 1.2786 and thus YTD highs. This comes in spite of a pick-up in Brexit-related commentary as UK lawmakers returned to Westminster with uncertainty on the process of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU rife as UK PM May&rsquo;s spokesperson stated that responsibility for confirming the meaningful vote remains with Parliament. As such, the next few days might test markets resolve in how willing they are to continue to buy up the GBP vs. USD, particularly if USD bulls return to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, AUD remained in a relatively tight range vs. the USD of 0.7110 to 0.7141 with the pair unable to test tech resistance of 0.7174 and 0.7182 which marks the 55 and 100DMAs respectively. Sentiment for the pair will likely be guided by noises out of Beijing as trade talks between the US and China commence, with the potential aim of securing H1 talks between US President Trump and Chinese Premier Li.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.4%) gained from the open with Australia led by strength in tech and miners, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed and initially rose by over 3% as it tracked the rally in its Wall St. counterparts. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) and Hang Seng (+0.8%) conformed to the positive tone following the RRR cut announcement and with mid-level trade discussions set to resume between US and China today, although the mainland lagged its regional peers following a CNY 170bln liquidity drain by the PBoC.

Elsewhere, US President Trump renewed his threat to invoke a national emergency as a way to circumvent Congress and build a wall on the southern US border in which he warned he may declare a national emergency dependent on what happens over the next few days. (Nikkei/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives in which many details of border security were discussed, while he added we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete.

May also left open the possibility of a 2nd referendum but stated that this is not a course of action she wanted to follow. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 200 UK lawmakers from the Conservative and opposition parties have signed a letter to UK PM May asking her to rule out the option of a No deal Brexit. (Newswires) This also comes in the context of reports stating that Parliament will vote on two amendments to the finance bill on Tuesday that would result in a government shutdown unless UK PM May is able to secure support for her Brexit deal. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK MPs reportedly believe that Parliamentary rules will prevent UK PM May bulldozing her Brexit deal through by staging multiple repeat votes until the Commons surrenders. (Independent)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May will decide today whether to cancel MPs&rsquo; February break and make them work at weekends as time runs out to pass Brexit legislation before Britain leaves the EU. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is set to make another bid to EU leaders to offer a concession on the Irish backstop as she attempts to win over Brexiters who have vowed to vote down the government&rsquo;s deal. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government are to hold the meaningful vote on the Brexit deal on January 15th; according to the BBC. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC&#39;s Laura Kuenssberg tweets that Labour are calling for PM to make an urgent statement to the Commons today on Brexit and the terms of debate.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are broadly in the red [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.5%] with underperformance seen in the FTSE 100 (-0.6%) after multiple downgrades within the index such as; Centrica (-4.6%), InterContinental Hotels (-2.1%) and Hargreaves Lansdown (-0.6%). Sectors are firmly in the red with the exception of IT which is the outperforming sector. Other notable stories include Tullow Oil (+1.7%) in the green after being upgraded at RBC. Ryanair (-1.0%) share prices are down as the Co are named the UK&rsquo;s worst short-haul airline for the 6th consecutive year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of pre-market news flow for the US, General Electric shares are up around 2.8% pre-market following reports that Apollo are considering a bid for the Co&rsquo;s jet-leasing business. Elsewhere, Apple&rsquo;s iPhone XR volume outlook for the initial 6-months of production has been approximately halved to 30-40mln units (WSJ). In recent news, Eli Lilly are to purchase Loxo Oncology for USD 8bln. (Stats News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD has kicked the week off on the back-foot in a continuation of the sentiment seen on Friday after Fed Chair Powell opted to strike a more flexible approach to monetary policy than the one he was perceived to have had at last month&rsquo;s press conference. As such, the DXY resides on a 95 handle after breaching 96.00 to the downside during Asia-Pac trade to a session low of 95.85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts have captured on the relative weakness of the USD to eke out mild gains with USD/JPY a key source of market focus. USD/JPY has drifted lower throughout the Asia-Pac and EU session&rsquo;s with a low print of 108.04 as the move ran out of steam ahead of the psychological 108.00 level where there were said to be bids, with larger bids noted at 107.50. Of note, from a risk perspective, opening gains in European bourses proved to be relatively short-lived with EU cash bourses mostly residing in modest negative territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gains for GBP vs. the USD have been relatively modest as political risk keeps prices anchored. Lawmakers return to Westminster this week and as such, Brexit-related commentary has ramped up significantly over the weekend. In terms of the latest state-of-play, May&rsquo;s meaningful vote appears to be going ahead on the 15th despite reports last week acknowledging that it is unlikely to pass. As such, the likelihood of alternative scenarios such as a second referendum, no deal Brexit and a confidence vote continue to heighten but with a distinct lack of clarity on what the most like course of action will be. In terms of price action, GBP/USD is currently trading around the mid-point of the session&rsquo;s 1.2719-55 range with Jan 2nd high of 1.2773 the next source of resistance should the USD concede further ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR has extended its recovery above 1.1400 vs. the USD with the move pausing for breath just under the 1.1450 level. Macro newsflow for the EZ remains light ahead of this week&rsquo;s ECB minutes release with mixed retail sales and factory orders from Germany unable to sway investor sentiment.&nbsp; From a technical perspective, Lloyds suggest a clear break above 1.1500 could inspire a gradual recovery towards 1.1600 before an eventual move towards range highs of 1.1750-1.1850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, AUD/USD has extended its post-Powell move above 0.7100 to reach a session high of 0.7141 with technical resistance seen at 0.7150, and with the 55 and 100DMAs at 0.7174 and 0.7182 respectively. Should prices take a turn lower, option activity for the pair could play a role with 1bln in expiries between 0.7095-0.7105. From a fundamental perspective, AUD will likely remain sensitive to trade updates between the US and China with traders mindful of the commencement of trade talks today in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt had started the session marginally higher as 10-year Bund futures trade choppily in the green by 20 ticks and maintain the 163.89 level as support and 164.40 as resistance after a surprise increase in German YY Retail Sales and larger than expected decline in MM Industrial Orders. Gilts have started Liffe higher by over 40 ticks after rumblings that the Brexit deal&rsquo;s approval could be conditional on more EU concessions, with the vote now just over a week away on January 15th as according to the BBC. On a technical standpoint, 10-year traders will be looking at the 123.91 4th Jan high as resistance. BTPs have extended on the risk-driven downside on the open, with Italian 10-years trading close to a session base of 126.05 ahead of the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Fixed income is taking a breather today after the action-packed end to the week, with 10-year futures essentially unchanged from last weeks close of 122-09, with traders now looking ahead to potentially market-moving commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Bostic later in the day after the release of the US&rsquo;s Durable Goods and Non-manufacturing PMI releases. Later on in the week we will also be looking ahead to the first note/bond supply of 2018 kicking off with 3yrs tomorrow, with 10yr and 30yr thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+2.3%) and WTI (+2.3%) prices are higher with WTI just over the USD 49/bbl level; fuelled by speculation that negotiations which are staring today between China and the US may lead to an easing in tensions between the two economies. Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes showed a decrease in oil rigs by 8 to 877, indicating that production may begin to slowdown although EIA data, also from last Friday, presented an unexpected build in crude inventories. Elsewhere, both Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale have lowered their 2019 average price expectation for Brent from USD 70bbl to USD 62.50 and USD 73/bbl to USD 64/bbl. With their WTI forecasts also lowered from USD 64.5/bbl to USD 55.5/bbl and USD 66/bbl to USD 57/bbl respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.5%) is in the green on dollar weakness following Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s Dovish comments regarding the future of rate hikes. Elsewhere, Chinese steel and iron ore are benefiting from the aforementioned commencement of US-China trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs cut 3-month copper price target to USD 6100/ton from USD 6500/ton but maintained 12-month copper forecast at USD 7000/ton, while it reduced base metals targets amid notable China deceleration. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s crude oil imports from Iran declined 26% M/M, to 204.9k BPD in December. According to tanker tracking data.

Sectors are firmly in the red with the exception of IT which is the outperforming sector. Other notable stories include Tullow Oil (+1.7%) in the green after being upgraded at RBC. Ryanair (-1.8%) share prices are down as the Co are named the UK&rsquo;s worst short-haul airline for the 6th consecutive year. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX &nbsp;<br />USD has kicked the week off on the back-foot in a continuation of the sentiment seen on Friday after Fed Chair Powell opted to strike a more flexible approach to monetary policy than the one he was perceived to have had at last month&rsquo;s press conference. As such, the DXY resides on a 95 handle after breaching 96.00 to the downside during Asia-Pac trade to a session low of 95.87.&nbsp;<br />Subsequently, the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts have captured on the relative weakness of the USD to eke out mild gains with USD/JPY a key source of market focus. USD/JPY has drifted lower throughout the Asia-Pac and EU session&rsquo;s with a low print of 108.04 as the move ran out of steam ahead of the psychological 108.00 level where there were said to be bids, with larger bids noted at 107.50. Of note, from a risk perspective, opening gains in European bourses proved to be relatively short-lived with EU cash bourses mostly residing in modest negative territory.&nbsp;<br />Elsewhere, gains for GBP vs. the USD have been relatively modest as political risk keeps prices anchored. Lawmakers return to Westminster this week and as such, Brexit-related commentary has ramped up significantly over the weekend. In terms of the latest state-of-play, May&rsquo;s meaningful vote appears to be going ahead on the 15th despite reports last week acknowledging that it is unlikely to pass. As such, the likelihood of alternative scenarios such as a second referendum, no deal Brexit and a confidence vote continue to heighten but with a distinct lack of clarity on what the most like course of action will be. In terms of price action, GBP/USD is currently trading around the mid-point of the session&rsquo;s 1.2719-55 range with Jan 2nd high of 1.2773 the next source of resistance should the USD concede further ground.&nbsp;<br />EUR has extended its recovery above 1.1400 vs. the USD with the move pausing for breath just under the 1.1450 level. Macro newsflow for the EZ remains light ahead of this week&rsquo;s ECB minutes release with mixed retail sales and factory orders from Germany unable to sway investor sentiment. &nbsp;From a technical perspective, Lloyds suggest a clear break above 1.1500 could inspire a gradual recovery towards 1.1600 before an eventual move towards range highs of 1.1750-1.1850.&nbsp;<br />Finally, AUD/USD has extended its post-Powell move above 0.7100 to reach a session high of 0.7141 with technical resistance seen at 0.7150, and with the 55 and 100DMAs at 0.7174 and 0.7182 respectively. Should prices take a turn lower, option activity for the pair could play a role with 1bln in expiries between 0.7095-0.7105. From a fundamental perspective, AUD will likely remain sensitive to trade updates between the US and China with traders mindful of the commencement of trade talks today in Beijing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FIXED INCOME&nbsp;<br />Core EU debt had started the session marginally higher as 10-year Bund futures trade choppily in the green by 20 ticks and maintain the 163.89 level as support and 164.40 as resistance after a surprise increase in German YY Retail Sales and larger than expected decline in MM Industrial Orders. Gilts have started Liffe higher by over 40 ticks after rumblings that the Brexit deal&rsquo;s approval could be conditional on more EU concessions, with the vote now just over a week away on January 15th as according to the BBC. On a technical standpoint, 10-year traders will be looking at the 123.91 4th Jan high as resistance.&nbsp;<br />US Fixed income is taking a breather today after the action packed end to the week, with 10-year futures essentially unchanged from last weeks close of 122-09, with traders now looking ahead to potentially market-moving commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Bostic later in the day after the release of the US&rsquo;s Durable Goods and Non-manufacturing PMI releases. Later on in the week we will also be looking ahead to the first note/bond supply of 2018 kicking off with 3yrs tomorrow, with 10yr and 30yr thereafter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES &nbsp;<br />Brent (+3.0%) and WTI (+3.0%) prices are higher with WTI just under the USD 49/bbl level; fuelled by speculation that negotiations which are staring today between China and the US may lead to an easing in tensions between the two economies. Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes showed a decrease in oil rigs by 8 to 877, indicating that production may begin to slowdown although EIA data, also from last Friday, presented an unexpected build in crude inventories. Elsewhere, both Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale have lowered their 2019 average price expectation for Brent from USD 70bbl to USD 62.50 and USD 73/bbl to USD 64/bbl. With their WTI forecasts also lowered from USD 64.5/bbl to USD 55.5/bbl and USD 66/bbl to USD 57/bbl respectively. &nbsp;<br />Gold (+0.5%) is in the green on dollar weakness following Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s Dovish comments regarding the future of rate hikes. Elsewhere, Chinese steel and iron ore are benefiting from the aforementioned commencement of US-China trade talks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

As such, the DXY continued to soften and breached the 96.00 level to the downside which has underpinned its major counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD above Friday&rsquo;s best levels, while AUD, NZD and CAD were also firmer as they benefitted from their high-beta characteristics. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses were initially elevated on the safe-haven outflows but have since pulled back from highs, and CNY firmed against the greenback to under 6.8500 following a stronger reference rate setting by the PBoC.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second summit between US President Trump and North Korea leader Kim is reportedly likely to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Elsewhere, gold prices were underpinned by the softer greenback in the aftermath of Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s dovish comments with the precious metal homing back in on the USD 1300/oz level, while copper was relatively flat as it took a breather from Friday&rsquo;s rally which was inspired by several bullish factors from both US and China.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (4/Jan): Oil down 8 at 877, NatGas unchanged at 198; total down 4 at 1075.

Goldman Sachs also cut 3-month copper price target to USD 6100/ton from USD 6500/ton but maintained 12-month copper forecast at USD 7000/ton, while it reduced base metals targets amid notable China deceleration. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields rose by between 7.5bps and 12bps across the curve on Friday, underpinned by a blockbuster payrolls report as well as dovish comments by Fed chair Powell. Most of the action was in the belly of the curve, which helped 2s5s widen by around 2bps on the session, leaving it around 0.5bps away from unwinding its inversion. However, other major curve spreads were tighter, notably the 5s30s part of the curve, which came in by over 5bps.

Elsewhere, US President Trump renewed his threat to invoke a national emergency as a way to circumvent Congress and build a wall on the southern US border in which he warned he may declare a national emergency dependent on what happens over the next few days, while he also said he is willing for the government shutdown to go on for months or years but doesn&#39;t think it will and hopes the government can reopen in a few days. (Nikkei/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives in which many details of border security were discussed, while he added we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete.

ASX 200 (+1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.6%) gained from the open with Australia led by strength in tech and miners, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed and initially rose by over 3% as it tracked the rally in its Wall St. counterparts. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) conformed to the positive tone following the RRR cut announcement and with mid-level trade discussions set to resume between US and China today, although the mainland lagged its regional peers following a CNY 170bln liquidity drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were softer with safe-haven demand dampened amid the rally across stocks, but with downside also stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 1tln in JGBs with maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks begin the week higher across the board as the region takes its first opportunity to react to the trifecta of bullish developments from last Friday including the blockbuster NFP jobs data, dovish comments from Fed Chair Powell and the PBoC&rsquo;s 100bps RRR cut. ASX 200 (+1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.8%) gained from the open with Australia led by strength in tech and miners, while the Japanese benchmark outperforms as it tracks the over 3% rally in its Wall St. counterparts. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) and Hang Seng (+1.4%) conform to the positive tone following the RRR cut announcement and with mid-level trade discussions set to resume between US and China today, but with the mainland lagging its regional peers following a CNY 170bln liquidity drain by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback failed to hold onto the initial knee-jerk support from Friday&rsquo;s stellar US jobs numbers as Fed Chair Powell provided a dovish tone in which he stated that Fed policy is not on a pre-set path, while he also noted the Fed will be patient in watching data and are prepared to adjust policy stance. As such, the DXY continues to soften and tests the 96.00 level to the downside which has underpinned its major counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD sitting at Friday&rsquo;s highs, while AUD, NZD and CAD are also firmer as they benefit from their high-beta characteristics. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses remain elevated on the safe-haven outflows and CNY firms against the greenback to under 6.8500 following a stronger reference rate setting by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are softer with safe-haven demand dampened amid the rally across stocks, but with downside also stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 1tln in JGBs with maturities spread across the curve</p>\r\n",
